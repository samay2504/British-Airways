### "told me my bags were too large"
Manchester to Seattle. My worst connecting flight experience ever. They forced me to pay $200 extra dollars at the gate. They told me that my bags were too large to be carried on. I had just got off a connecting flight with SAS. They told me that I could have avoided the $200 bag fee if I would have checked my bags in. There was no where to check your bags in, you literally are just dropped off and go find your next gate. After paying the $200 for two bags, I board the plane and the over headbins are very empty. This is ridiculous.

### "flight was okay"
Gatwick to Heraklion, MT 1178 (6th September 2019) left a little late, but it made up some time-the meal which I had pre-paid for arrived almost three hours into the flight, no water was offered, or wine, just a weak flavoured tea, which didn't really quench my thirst. This was very disappointing, I expected more. The aircraft seemed very cramped inside. The take off message during the safety demonstration was very mumbled. The flight was ok, it would have been nice if the flight destination screen's had been switched on. Once through passport control and having collected my case, there was a row of coaches outside the terminal, and even at 10pm, the place was very busy. On return, arrived at Heraklion Airport. Packed with people, no where to sit, as we waited for a delayed flight back to Gatwick. This time the flight destination screens were switched on and off in between an old episode of an American sitcom. I had to ask when the food was coming, as it had been several hours since my last meal. Again, no water or wine was offered, only another cup of flavourless tea. It seemed that duty free sales came first, The flight was okay.

### "flight was actually ok"
Not Verified |  Zante to Glasgow. First time in 5 years flying Thomas Cook, so was unsure if it would be as bad as the previous trip, We got to Glasgow Airport two hours and a half before takeoff, to be met with a queue of hundreds at the TC Desks, two checkin desks open, utter chaos, finally got booked in after an hour and 15 mins, They had to ask people on the Corfu flight to come forward as they would miss there flight if they had stayed in the queue, We got checked in, then up and joined the queues at Passport Control, got through eventually and got into the departure lounge in time to grab a cup of takeaway tea, as the flight started boarding, Not a good start, But the Flight left bang on time, 6.30am, We had ordered pre booked meals, these were served after a drinks round, which left no where to put your meal down, utterly bizarre, We usually go with Jet 2, who serve meals first, and you get a choice, Thomas Cook just get a meal placed in front of you, no choice at all. It was Breakfast so was not too bad, and the flight was actually ok, Just need to sort out the boarding / check in procedures and maybe give people a choice of meals which you are paying for. But as for flights both were ok, home leg from Zante was 45 mins late, but no big deal.

### "Excellent flight for a cheap price"
Orlando to Manchester with Thomas Cook Airlines. A low cost airline which provided a really good experience, especially given the very low price of the ticket. The flight departed one hour late, but caught up and arrived on time. Food was really good. The entertainment was limited, only a few movies, but good. Excellent flight for a cheap price.

### "crammed in like sardines"
Bristol to Larnaca. A320 of Smartlynx Airlines painted in Thomas Cook colours. 2 hours late leaving Bristol, the luggage was on board but apparently the computer had deleted it off the system. The luggage had to be unloaded and matched up to the passengers then loaded again. Seat the most uncomfortable I have ever sat in, crammed in like sardines. No hot water on the flight so no tea or coffee, also ran out of ice halfway through the trip. Cabin crew were very pleasant but oddly had a rest break halfway through the flight. I will not fly on this airline again if I can help it.

### "rubbish for the amount of money paid"
Manchester to New York with Thomas Cook Airlines. Absolute rubbish for the amount of money paid. Uncomfortable seats that do not recline and very hard. Angle of seat causes neckache, with only a handful of movies for free (6) and old. No free beverages only with dinner:- tea, coffee (no decaf, good job I had my own) squash, pop and water. Came around twice for a long haul flight of 7.5 hours. Thought we got sandwiches before we landed - a dismal flapjack and small cup of water. I wouldn’t fly with them again nor would the people I was with.

### "a decent airline"
❎ Not Verified | Plovdiv to Belfast. It was a decent airline. The seats where mildly uncomfortable though and the free food was disgusting except for the mousse you got in a pot and the lemon muffin as well. The flight staff were nice enough, they didn't talk much but there was one flight attendant who was nice. The food that was actually decent thought was expensive Seriously! £4 for a hot beverage and some shortbread, and it claims to be 'competitive prices' no way! I guess this airline is sort of 'fly us if you are broke yet want to go on a holiday. And they also don't have anywhere to charge your phone and they don't have wifi either. Not good. Overall if you are flying this airline, bring about £15-£20 for the flight because the actually nice food is expensive. Maybe would recommend to someone who doesn't have the money to fly with other, more expensive airlines.

### "spare yourself the agony"
Manchester to San Francisco with Thomas Cook Airlines. Absolute trash for the amount of money paid. Very hard, uncomfortable seats that cannot recline. Angle of seat causes neckache, broken handle on seat and only a handful of movies for free. Plug for headphones defective. Lack of free beverages. Absolutely unfit for a long haul flight of 10 hours. Do not fly with them and spare yourself the agony.

### "weight was 12kg instead of 8kg"
Gatwick to Larnaca. I was shocked with the treatment of staff at Gate 1 right before our departure. I had already checked in my 20kg luggage and had my cabin luggage weighted at the check in before (a cabin luggage sticker was placed on my cabin bag). Upon arriving at Gate 1, a member of staff Becca weighed our cabin luggage together with our laptop bags and the total weight for each of us was 12kg instead of 8kg. Okay, I understand that we were overweight, but she then asked for my credit card that I made my booking with. At that time I thought that she wanted to confirm my booking so I gave it to her. She then told me that she wasn’t able to get a payment from my card. She tried to charge me without telling me! She insisted 3-4 times and was very rude. She took my credit card from my hands and when I was asking her of what she was doing I didn’t get a reply! Really, is this your customer service? She told me the extra charge was 65£ but then charged me 130£ Without telling me and I saw it as soon as I boarded the plane! Why were we treated like that? As we were the last people to board the plane we payed 130£ for that extra 4kg, so that we didn’t cause any further delay of the airplanes departure. I personally felt insulted and found her behaviour impolite and disrespectful.

### "such a poor bunch of staff"
Not Verified |  We have just returned from Dalaman on Thomas Cook flight MT105 into Gatwick and after 50 years of flying I have never encountered such a poor bunch of staff. We paid for something called Economy Plus which the cabin manager Leanne obviously resented anyone having. Our food was late and had to be prised from the staff...apparently there was some error on the paperwork and we could not have our meals until it was sorted. On a 4 hour flight we not even offered a cup of coffee, a rude member of staff told us they were too busy after they had taken a 'compulsory break' during the flight! We asked for a cold white wine and were told there are no fridges on the aircraft and the ice had run out - in row 2 and service started from the front. In the end we decided to press attendant button and it took 7 minutes for anyone to appear from behind the curtain where the cabin crew were busy munching their food ... a good job it was not an emergency. When she appeared and we asked for our 1st cup of coffee .. some two and half hours into the flight we were told that the sale of duty frees took priority and IF they had time after we may be able to have a cup of coffee - 2 passengers sarcastically asked what the sachets of milk in their meals were supplied for. There were other passengers saying exactly the same as me, Thomas Cook never again. It just seemed like the staff were sure their jobs were going sometime soon and really couldn't care less. This great British airline appears to have given up hope and the whole experience reminds me of the last few months of Monarch airlines and look how that ended. A total disgrace and some employees of Thomas Cook need to take a long hard look at themselves after this dismal performance!

### "combined weight of 8kg"
Gatwick to Split. Comfort on the seats is terrible, check in staff are rude and unhelpful but most egregious was the baggage charge. In small print they inform you on the website that the only baggage allowed is a combined weight of 8kg with your cabin bag + backpack. Note that this is considerably lower than other budget airline never mind one that markets itself as helpful. They demanded the money and held our passports until we paid.

### "£140 to check the bag"
Not Verified |  I was at checking desk with my wife at Manchester UK returning to New York JFK. We together had one bag to check in and my ticket has the allowance. The agent insisted we don’t have allowance even after I showed reservation document (when we went to Manchester, it was allowed) and ordered us to pay £140 in order to check the bag or abandon it. Due to time constraint, we paid the amount with the understanding that if I can demonstrate my ticket has the bag allowance I can get the refund. After returning to home, I immediately filed a complaint through custom relation online. It says will address within 28 days. I waited through a month and followed up twice. No response!

### "Lovely cabin crew"
Manchester to Gran Canaria. Awesome flight to Gran Canaria, we purchased Economy Plus. We got reserved seats, premium check in, fast track security, extra luggage, Premium drinks & meals included. We sat in Row 1/B., seat very wide & extra leg room. Lovely cabin crew, very attentive. Drinks were flowing and James Martin premium meal was very nice (my partner had vegetarian) and recommended it. No inflight entertainment but still a great flight.

### "Would certainly recommend"
Flew from Gatwick to Las Palmas. Paid for exit row seats which were great. Loads of leg room and very attentive crew. Check in was extremely quick, security at the airport was prompt and the flight arrived in Las Palmas on time. Excellent on board meals and a great selection of drinks available. Would certainly recommend Thomas Cook Airlines and use in the future.

### "Most stressful experience"
Not Verified |  So I try to check in- not working online despite multiple times. States to arrive 1 hour before as check in closed then. Arrive 1.5 hours before and there is a queue of at least 50 people and two people at the desks when they wrote on website they were having issues with online check in! At least get more staff in to check in. I would have missed flight if they didn’t push me to front ( which others did not appreciate). Then I am waiting for announcements - states boarding then boarding closing at x time. I arrive 5 minutes before and see the departure lounge full of people sitting. No one boarding! Then 10 minutes later just before flight is meant to leave they decide to make announcement that there is an issue and we will have to wait an hour for next plane to arrive. No one boarded so it was a lie: do not make there rush to gate when you are giving false information. Most stressful experience I have had.

### "happy flying Thomas Cook"
Not Verified |  We have always been happy flying Thomas Cook. The flights have always been smooth takeoffs and landings. and aircrew very helpful and efficient. The seating is a bit tight, but otherwise, everything else is fine. Disabled assistance is very good.

### "Not worth the money!"
London Gatwick to Banjul with Thomas Cook. Premium seats are exactly the same seats as economy. Food is no different from what you get normally or very little change at best. Entertainment is an overhead screen. Long way to go to call this premium! Not worth the money!

### "Pleasant and professional staff"
Not Verified |  After reading some of the very negative reviews I regretted having bought a one way flight to Goa. However, it turned out that the meagre price of £154.00 was well spent. I'm a regular long distance traveller who likes a bargain flight and Thomas Cook ticked all the boxes. Pleasant and professional staff, bright cabin with 242 layout and much comfier economy seat than Norwegian long haul. Decent legroom too. Meal was tasty and sufficent was included and followed later with an Afternoon tea unlike Norwegian and two out of 4 trolley runs served free drinks. Okay, no paying entertainment was very restricted but I watched two films and a tv show as well listened to a bit of music. Timely flight. In all thumbs up and I'll be back again.

### "clearly marked Gluten Free Meal"
Manchester to Holguin return. Beware if you are on a strict Gluten Free diet, On the outbound flight, I was given my meal, the packaging was clearly marked Gluten Free Meal (GFML) but the salad filled roll on the second mouthful didn't taste like any Gluten Free bread I have had in the past, so I looked at the cellophane wrapper it came in, and to my it was 40% wheat, I am Celiac and even the slightest bit of any food containing Gluten, makes me very ill, two hours later I am violently sick and the two weeks away are spent on the toilet with diarrhea or in the bathroom being sick, not to mention severe stomach pain, and of course a dry mouth, feeling tired all of the time,. On my return I duly make a complaint, and TC response, "sorry for giving you a salad roll". No mention of Gluten, and no apology for making me ill.

### "impressed with food selection"
Gatwick to Banjul. We have just returned from the Gambia and enjoyed a very good flight. I wanted to really say how impressed I was with James Martin's food selection,  delicious, very hot and the right amount. Thank .

### "10 hours of agony"
Manchester to Las Vegas return. Horrendous return flight. Broken seat back on so called premium seat meant 10 hours of agony. Basically no control over recline meant it shot back on take off and went back and forth throughout the flight. It caused a massive row with the people behind and yet Thomas Cook say nothing was wrong after waiting 3 months for them to respond. Premium seats are really no better than economy anyway and food is barely any different from what you normally get. Premium entertainment still extremely limited when compared to middle eastern airlines. Long way to go to call this premium! System doesn't accept a zero rating hence it gets a 1!

### "The staff were brilliant"
Fuerteventura to Manchester. Cannot praise the cabin staff enough! We upgraded to Economy Plus when we booked our holiday, well worth the extra as you get fast track, extra luggage allowance, plus food and drinks included the the price. Our Daughter and 2 year old Grandson joined us on our second week of our holiday, and as they didn’t book until a later date they were not seated with then rest of our family. We noticed that the seats in front of us were empty, we asked if our Daughter could move as she was on her own with a baby? The staff were brilliant, they helped her with her bags to be by the rest of us!

### "never fly with them again"
Orlando to Manchester. From the very start things did not go well, we had requested wheel chair assistance for my wife who has mobility restrictions, the assistance consisted of me pushing a wheel chair most of the way through the airport, the boarding was some what of a fiasco the gate agents spent more time idly chatting with each other and made several incorrect announcements resulting in a lot of confusion. In all fairness the aircraft cabin crew were very good with very good cabin service in flight. The arrival at Manchester UK was also problematic with no staff to push a wheel chair so again I pushed the chair. The return trip was worse the check in agent was surly and not very helpful he informed us that there had been an aircraft change and that the aircraft did not have an economy plus section we were handed a notice indicating that we would receive a refund for the fair difference and also $ 50 dollars each compensation ,as directed we submitted our request as indicated on the airport hand out as of January the 28th 2019 we have had no refund even thou Thomas Cooks airport hand out indicated we would receive it within 28 days we have E-mailed Thomas Cook with no meaning full reply so far, I will never fly with them again the whole experience was disappointing. I am not an infrequent flyer having traveled all over the world in my occupation for over 40 years.

### "aircraft used is unsuitable"
Manchester to Hurghada. The aircraft used for this 5hr+ flight is in my opinion unsuitable. The seats don't recline and are quiet hard, no entertainment system or charging ports and its not like the lack of amenities are hugely reflected in the ticket price but the flight crew were very friendly and professional so not all bad.

### "flights were punctual"
Manchester to Marrakech with Thomas Cook. Third sunshine holiday flight with this airline. As before the plane was pretty full with cramped seating and a crew dedicated to selling as much food and merchandise as possible. Both outbound and inward flights were punctual and the crews affable. We spent £49 each on extra legroom seats, money well spent when seeing how tight the standard seats are. Nonetheless, they got us there and back safely and on time, which is all that matters.

### "told we would get a refund"
Birmingham to Bourgas. Their Customer Services is very poor and they fail to fulfill what they preach. We were told we would get a refund on the None Service for Priority Boarding, this failed to arrive as they wanting permission by letter to put the funds into our account. Nobody else ever has done this, a delaying tactic by Thomas Cook. They are quick to get your money but not in return. Do not use this Airline unless you want the same.

### "Not flying with them again"
I flew with them from Manchester to New York and back. On both occasions, we were told the aircraft had to be changed to another one without an entertainment system. The plane was older than the one advertised and with uncomfortable seats. It makes me think that maybe they only have this one plane in their fleet which they pretend to be their entire fleet. The outbound flight was delayed for over 3 hours. We were told at first it was due to the change of aircraft but then when I asked for compensation they blamed it on the weather. I was also charged a fee of £90 for overweight which is not mentioned anywhere on the flight. I even called them the day before and their customer service couldn't tell me how much it would be or if I'd be charged at all. Service on board was very unprofessional. The crew was very loud, especially on the night flight, it was impossible to sleep with the noise they were making by talking to each other and to passengers. They were also completely out of sync. The front of the plane was a mess with stuff spread all over the floor. I was on the first row of the plane and they kept bumping into me throughout the flight and throwing the curtains at me. Getting a glass of water during the flight seemed to be a huge trouble for them. The food was disgusting and portions were small. There was a single round of complimentary drinks on a 7-hour flight. Then the rest of the flight was Thomas Cook trying to sell us things. Not flying with them again.

### "lack of the knowledge"
Gatwick to Dalaman. I am settled in the UK or also known as ILR (Indefinite Leave to Remain visa) in the UK. The bio-metric card shows an expiry date which is to update if any details change and also the photo will be needed to change just like driving license but the expiry date of the bio-metric car do not represent the end date of my settlement / Indefinite Leave to Remain as there is none. To get Turkish Visa I have always put 'Unlimited' UK Visa in their section as it is correct. If I put the expiry date of the BRP card as my expiry date of ILR that will be wrong. When we went to board the aircraft, the personnel misunderstood the meaning of the expiry date of my Bio-metric (BRP) card and took that as the expiry date of my Visa which is totally wrong. Staff denied my boarding as she thought I my Turkish visa is incorrect as I have put 'Unlimited' in the section of 'Additional V. Expiry Date'. She mentioned that I have put incorrect details in my Turkish Visa and therefore she can not allow me to travel. Her colleague mentioned, that if I am allowed to travel to Turkey there will be fines to pay and if I am ready to pay the fine and removed my name from the passenger list. I kept explaining that the expiry date is the expiry date of my BRP card not my ILR. They almost closed off the gate and denied me to board the aircraft. After explaining that I have travelled to Turkey before with the same information about visa given to receive Turkish Visa, one of the ladies went to speak to man who was dealing with another Thomas Cook flight. He came in and spoke to someone over the phone for few minutes I was allowed to board the aircraft when the cabin crew was about the shut the door. Isn’t this indicating the lack of the knowledge of your staff and how wrong they were?

### " I thought this airline was great"
Not Verified |  Manchester to Cancun. Having travelled with most of the big name airlines, I decided to fly Thomas Cook as it is the only direct option for this route. The staff were happy and friendly, the aircraft interior was minimal, but it was clean and spacious- it is no frills. We were given a complimentary bottle of water on boarding. The food in the flight was brilliant, we were served 2 meals and they were both great. It was simple food that was really tasty. You do have to pay extra for all drinks on board, however we were fully aware of this before hand, and everything was reasonably priced. The entertainment is £5 if you would like a full choice of films, but free for 5 of them. The screens are big and also touch screen- a charging port is also provided. Overall I would fly with them again, at the end of the day - you get what you pay for. I thought this airline was great!

### "a very pleasant flight"
Manchester to New York JFK. Surprised at how good our flight was after reading some negative reviews. The A330 seemed quite roomy probably as it was in a 2-4-2 configuration; also liked that the toilets were downstairs (4 of them), also one at the back of the 'plane if anyone has difficulty with stairs. Although this was a full flight, service on board was excellent. The economy class IFE is a bit limited, however as the flight had a 90 minute delay, they opened up the premium entertainment for free in economy (normally cost £5.00), which was a nice touch. The food was pretty good also. The 3 course James Martin inspired lunch was excellent and a snack was also provided one hour prior to landing. Unlike many other low cost airlines, meals are included in the ticket price. Seat pitch was 31" and felt very comfortable. A pillow and a bottle of water is provided and on the overnight return flight, a blanket was also provided. All in all, this was a very pleasant flight and the 7.5 hour flight passed pretty quickly and pleasantly. I would definitely be happy to fly long-haul with Thomas Cook again.

### "happily fly with them again"
Not Verified |  We booked to fly with Thomas Cook from Stansted to Skiathos in August and our flights were changed to an airline called Smartlynx a couple of months before, not a problem at all. On the day we boarded promptly and the crew were very friendly. The aircraft itself was nice, seats were comfy and the cabin was clean. Same good experience on the return flight although we had a slight delay and landed into Stansted about 40 minutes behind schedule but it’s nothing significant so no problems there. Crew again were very good and the aircraft was clean with the same comfortable seats. Thomas Cook were cheaper than most airlines on this route and would happily fly with them again.

### "most uncomfortable seats"
Not Verified |  Gatwick to Orlando. Never again! The worst airline I have ever been with. The most uncomfortable seats I have ever sat in on a flight. Everyone in my family had backache after 20 minutes and a numb bum, plastic armrests, and almost no padding. We paid nearly £800 per person and being expected to pay for drinks, is simply a disgrace. Never mind paying for decent films etc! My nephew was horribly sick and was told that there were no more sick bags available. He got given a carrier bag. I would like to say that the service made a difference, but, after being shoved aside by an oblivious steward, no! We have flown on many airlines over the years and Thomas Cook is by far the worst. Next time we'll go with any other company.

### "seats extremely uncomfortable"
Manchester to Los Angeles. We flew premium outbound and economy inbound as no premium seats available. Premium ok for what we paid and tolerable for 11 hour flight. Economy seats extremely uncomfortable despite having exit seats. Don't recline, narrow and not tall enough for tall people. On both legs, food portions and type were inadequate for the length of the journey. We were hungry. Not enough drinks service. Lights are put out and you're encouraged to sleep. Only pro is cost in comparison to other airlines, direct flight and on time. Staff were fine.

### "took an hour for the luggage"
Orlando to Manchester. It took an hour for the luggage to come out onto the conveyor. The staff working in the baggage claim were not at all informative as to why the bags were delayed or if they were coming. It seems like TC should let passengers know what is going on and for goodness sakes apologize. Even train companies apologize for delays and their tickets don’t cost as much. As it turned out, my father was dying in hospital and I got and hour less to be w him. While the crew on the way out were charming, the crew on the way back were dreadful. They were rude, didn’t smile. They had No landing cards. And the lights were on for most of the flight so I got no sleep. I will not fly TC ever again.

### "still waiting for some feedback"
Not Verified |  Corfu to Gatwick. MT 1026 outbound flight, within half an hour of take off with various free magazines and newspapers, I was offered a complimentary breakfast and a bottle of wine. Drop down flight monitors provided good information about arrival time, and the outside temperature. MT 1027 Arrived at the airport and almost immediately Thomas Cook reps had vanished, tiny airport. Flight was on time - service was very poor on board, when the food came round I was told that I would have to pay for anything I wanted, even though I stated I did not have to pay from the UK. I was really annoyed by this double standard on board - nobody seemed to care. A Thomas cook holiday costing nearly eight hundred pounds should include free food and beverages both ways. It seemed I as a passenger didn't matter during the rush to get back to the UK (they couldn't even be bothered to switch on the flight destination screens). I was sent an email asking for my review, and I am still waiting for some feedback. If it were my business I would want to know good or bad comments, and then improve the shortfalls.

### "Simply terrible"
Fuerteventura to Gatwick. Simply terrible, 6 kg max for cabin baggage (ridiculous) and I got charged 65 pounds because mine was 6.5 kg, just before the boarding. No more words are necessary

### "most uncomfortable seat"
Not Verified |  Orlando to Gatwick. We chose this flight because of schedule, non-stop. What a tragic mistake, seats don’t recline and the smallest most uncomfortable seat. They didn’t load cups for hot beverages so no coffee or tea and no alternate offered. Difficult to get a cup of water on a long 8.5 hour flight which was late taking off. Staff was always in a hurry but found to be chatting in the galleys, minimal effort. This will be a skip in the future.

### "staff couldn’t care less"
Not Verified |  Newcastle to Tenerife. Booked flights 8 days ago, received email yesterday to say seats changed, when I phoned they advised flight time change to a completely different day. No thought for time of work, car booked in to car park etc. Their staff couldn’t care less at the distress and upset caused, stating the flight is cancelled yet still advertising it on their booking site. I’ve had to change flights, from a different airport at a cost of £240 and one day less on my holiday!

### "flights were really good"
Manchester to Orlando return. Both flights were really good. Seats were comfy and had plenty of leg room. All cabin crew on both flights were brilliant and helpful. Aircraft was very clean, especially the toilet areas. Both take off and landings were smooth, some of the best landings I’ve experienced. Only down side was paying for extras like movies and drinks, but it’s a small price to pay for how good the flight was. Will fly again in future!

### "good value for money"
Not Verified |  Having used BA, Virgin and SAA before I was pleasantly surprised with Thomas Cook, check in was smooth and flight only 10 mins late leaving, flight itself was smooth and and seat was reasonable for 12 hour flight, crew were polite and the James Martin meal was good, landed on time. I paid for priority bording but aside for security at Gatwick it was a waste of money, the meal on return from Cape Town was locally sourced and poor, inflight entertainment is basic and cost £5 to upgrade so I would suggest a book or kindle although the screens on the A330 are very good and have a usb port, TC charge for cheap earphones and best to take your own, snacks and drinks are extra so suggest you get some before boarding. Overall good value for money at nearly £900 cheaper than BA for 2 and the A330 is a far better plane than the BA747. TC flight slot was akward arriving at Cape Town 23.05 and departing there at 00.30 but that was only on the dates I selected.

### "sat bolt upright for 11 hours"
I flew from Manchester to Las Vegas in so-called "Premium Economy". The scheduled plane had a fault so a replacement was provided. During the 11 hour flight we found out that the seats did not recline. We sat bolt upright for 11 hours! As far as I am aware this plane was designed for short haul only. My legs were killing me after only a few hours. On the return flight I chose a bulkhead seat in order to expect good legroom. Big mistake! I am 6ft 2ins and the space between the seat and the bulkhead was ridiculously small. Once again stretching my legs was impossible. 10 hours with my legs tucked underneath is no joke! A complaint to Thomas Cook was sent and they scandalously refused to answer any questions about legality of the seating simply referring me to an independent tribunal panel at a cost of £25! Thomas Cook has "opted out" of the CAA complaints review service and they in turn also referred me to the tribunal panel. Disgusting is the only word I have for this airline. Never again will I use them and if you want to I suggest that you read the rest of the scathing reviews. Your choice!

### "airline I’ll never fly again"
Gatwick to Cancun. 1 hour delay, extra suitcase charges are extortionate (up to USD185 for extra 20kg if paid on the day, 50% discount if paid before). They only allow 6kg hand luggage. Probably the most uncomfortable long haul flight seats I’ve sat on. Poor food/meal and you have to pay for all drinks during the flight (including soft drinks). There was no option to upgrade to business class and have a more comfy seat (premium class are next to emergency exits and only give you extra leg room). At face value it seems like a cheap flight option, but the reality it isn’t and is an airline I’ll never fly with again.

### "impressed by the entertainment"
Glasgow to Heraklion. I was really impressed by the inflight entertainment system because I guess I was not expected it. Music during your flight (you have to have your own headphones) and also screens (not individuals but still you can manage to watch without problem) with different programs, mainly for children though (but I love cartoons!). The cabin crew was friendly and so was the pilot and the first officer who was informing the passengers throughout the whole journey about the weather and our estimate time or arrival. The price was incredibly good. Overall I highly recommend this airline and I will definitely fly again.

### "appalling customer service"
Don’t even bother booking a Thomas Cook Airlines flight. It was the worst experience ever! We paid £130 for 2x£65 seat upgrades for extra legroom only to be told 30mins before boarding that they had double booked our seats and we were being moved to normal seats! The only way to get a refund was to wait until getting back to UK and put in a complaint form online and wait 28 days! Even then, after phoning them they insisted that they never received my complaint! Absolutely appalling customer service with no concern for its customers. We will never fly again with Thomas Cook. Also on our Outbound trio my inflight entertainment didn’t work and it meant having no entertainment for a 10 hour flight! Plus when we got back to Manchester our suitcase was damaged beyond repair.

### "already rebooked for next year"
Manchester to New York JFK was operated by AirTanker. This aircraft had excellent seat pitch, thanks to slim line seating, a complimentary bottle of water was in the seat pocket on boarding. There was WiFi screening of entertainment via an app, which worked. There are no individual tv screens in the seat backs in this particular aircraft. Food was identical to the offerings you'd expect on BA, AA or UA, basic but ok. All beverages were chargeable, except tea/ coffee with meal. The return from New York was a Thomas Cook aircraft which had individual tv screens in the seat backs. On boarding water bottle, pillow and blanket were placed on seat. Leg room was excellent. On take off and cheese and tomato sandwich, followed by a drinks service were provided. Then crew dimmed the lights for three hours allowing passengers to attempt to sleep. An hour and half prior to landing in Manchester a hot breakfast of scrambled eggs etc was served. On both flights departed and arrived on time and had crew who were friendly and professional. The ticket was £400/500 cheaper than the other airlines (VS & UA) who fly the MAN NYC route. Would I recommend? Yes. Have already rebooked for June next year, but in premium economy.

### "stuck up and abrupt inbound"
Flight boarded late, we taxied out to runway and then announced technical problem with aircraft. Parked at hangar for engineers to take a look. Sat on plane roughly 1hr30. No offer of entertainment or drinks at this stage. Paid for premium entertainment otherwise films & tv selection was dire. Thomas Cook don't serve drinks for free only alongside your meal but thats fine we already knew this. They did provide a bottle of water each way which is good. Seat was ok not super comfy but better than BA's old worn out dirty seat. IFE was modern. Plane was relatively clean but missed rubbish in a few areas and tray tables dirty. Service was good outbound but stuck up and abrupt inbound. Cabin member moaned about her job, the Pax and just anything. She met every request with a straight No! Outbound meal was lovely inbound catering from states was poor. No choice just plain tomato pasta for everyone. Breakfast was muffin, yoghurt and orange juice. It was ok but again I've had better, British Airways provide hot wrap alongside cold parts. I know this is a more budget option and we chose them as they were cheapest. If you go with that in mind you will be fine. If you expect all inclusive service, IFE and food etc youll be disappointed. I would fly with them again if they were the cheapest direct option.

### "they canceled a flight"
Tenerife to Gatwick in February 2018, they canceled a flight, lying the all day not admitting that and keep saying the flight was just delayed. Online was clearly written cancelled, they were very saying was not true. They lied until 22.30, when the flight was cancelled! We asked if they can give us food voucher and drinks, they didn't. We asked if you could leave the airport and go to sleep paying ourselves our accommodation, they said that they were arranging accommodations for us. Of course at 1 in the morning, they said that unfortunately they couldn't find any accommodation. The day after, the flight was scheduled for 9 am, no one from Thomas Cook showed up until 12. We left again with 3 hours delay, but this time after 24 hours at the airport they gave us 10 euros vouchers for food! When we arrived in London they gave us a paper saying they apologies and they will give us a refund of £200 each, plus expenses. And we are July now, and it's since February that I am trying to speak with them, sent I don't even remember how many emails, called the customer service, wrote on Twitter - they never got back to me.

### "a more budget style airline"
Orlando to Gatwick. We received a text message/email an hour or so before leaving for the airport saying our flight had been delayed by 4.5 hours however the check-in desk will still close at the normal time, meaning we need to check in almost 6 hours prior to flying at the latest. Upon arriving I asked the check-in agent if they are about to close and she said no, not until an hour before the flight. When I complained about the delay and the fact that we now have hours and hours to wait all evening in the airport (!) when I had a suite still available to hang out in, I was flat out ignored, the member of staff refused to answer questions and proceeded to hurriedly check in our luggage. Eventually she pointed at a '4-hour pre check-in' sign and said well you need to check in 4 hours early anyway. I explained that I had never heard of that in my life (how would a sign help if you're not at the airport yet) but was ignored (I later complained to someone else who explained this was when they opened and was only an advised time - I showed him the TC website which states the standard 3 hours and told him how rude his colleague had been). The agent did not apologise or show any empathy or understanding. A colleague came over to explain further and provide a $10 meal voucher but also did not apologise or seem to care very much. She pointed out they are just third party staff and to contact TC. A little later I went back to complain to a manager and the agent just said there wasn't one. Then nothing, we just stood there. Eventually a more experienced colleague overheard and took over apologising for the confusion on behalf of TC. Well eventually we got on to our flight and the pilot apologised and explained the reason for the delay (repairing faulty smoke detectors). Service was okay, not great. Entertainment, food etc I'm not really sure about as I was semi-conscious the entire way but I get the impression it's a more budget style airline doing long-haul flights. I bought exit seats which were small and had a ridiculously hidden recline switch which staff struggled to find (don't think anyone actually used it from looking around) also a stiff tv bracket, but at least we could stretch out. When we landed there was an approx 20-30 min delay in getting our baggage which was not appreciated.

### "don’t book the airport lounges"
Not Verified | Manchester to Kos. Please don’t book the airport lounges if flying with Thomas Cook from Manchester. You pay for 3hours in lounge but Thomas Cook won’t let you check in until exactly 3hours before takeoff even though you’ve already checked in online. After this you still need to go through security and all the delays this brings, you also have to be at the gate 30 Mina before takeoff reducing time spent in lounge considerably. Thomas Cook staff were very rude at info desk when trying to make this point and saying airport lounges were nothing to do with them even though they bombard you with offers to book them by email pre holiday. Won’t be booking lounges again.

### "Plane very cramped"
Not Verified |  Had booked and paid for priority boarding and extra leg rooms seats each way. No priority boarding either sector, told by check in on outward journey by priority desk to go to the other main queue! Did receive allocated seats outward, but not on homeward for our 4 passengers. Staff at PMI seem to ignore any prebooking and allocate as they see fit. No priority homeward either. Plane very cramped and one of us could not even get his drinks tray lowered at all, as it was so cramped and he is not obese. Staff were helpful but a very disappointing end to a nice holiday. Have spoken to Cooks who are arranging a refund but I really do not like this hassle over what should be a straightforward booking. Won't use this airline again.

### "too uncomfortable to recommend"
Grim seating. Nice Staff. I didn't realise that the "premium" cabin has no additional legroom. It was just so uncomfortable for me as a person of 6ft 4 ins. A friend booked us on this flight as we were going as a group, so I didn't get the chance to check on the legroom beforehand. The staff seemed nice and professional though. Sorry, just too uncomfortable for me to be able to recommend. If you are in the first row there is a bulkhead, so nowhere at all to stretch out your legs- not even under a seat!

### "no explanation was given"
Not Verified |  We flew through a Thomas Cook booking with Condor Airlines. The flight was over four hours late leaving Los Angeles. No explanation was given and no refreshments or food vouchers offered. They tried to scam us into checking our carry-ons (for a fee) at the baggage drop, and if we hadn't known our rights, they might have succeeded. The departure board had departure times that came and went, and when we asked at the desk, no explanation was given.

### "like long haul Ryanair"
Manchester to New York JFK return. This was the most stressful outbound flight experience I have had. I arrived over 2 hours early for my flight to NY and was greeted by absolute chaos in the Manchester check in area - enormous queues of passengers just not moving and angry "priority" passengers yelling at staff as normal queues were moving faster than them. Eventually they opened more desks and things got moving but it was nearly an hour by the time I got to check in. Outbound my hand luggage was 8kg (so 2kg over the 6kg luggage allowance) which I hadn't realised as I booked the flight the day before for a surprise visit my fiancé had planned. Most other airlines have a 10kg hand luggage allowance so the 6kg is unreasonably restrictive IMO, and is clearly not a safety thing as "premium" passengers are allowed 10kg. As we were only going for the weekend I had packed a trolley case with very little inside and since my partner lives in the states I took the chance to use my baggage allowance to pack some items we had not yet been able to take out there like bedding etc which was in a sealed box. The guy on the desk was adamant I had to lose 2kgs or pay £95 to check in my hand baggage. I asked if I could pay per kilo I was overweight as I had no way to repack the sealed box and could not afford to pay the extortionate check-in fee which is higher than additional baggage charges I have paid on other airlines when I genuinely have had to check a bag in. He was (rudely) adamant no. So I relented and said well if I had to transfer into my checked bag which was only 15kg then I needed scissors and tape to open and reseal the box. Not his problem" apparently, and I was told I had to find somewhere else in the terminal to do it or pay the £95. Long story short the baggage storage counter was nice enough to let me use their stuff but I think the rudeness and disorganisation of the staff and stingy, inflexible and ridiculously expensive baggage policy is enough to put off flying with them again. By the time I got my bag checked the flight was boarding and I had to run through security to get to the gate. Had the same enormous check-in queue issue at JFK on the return leg, where the queue at 7pm for a 10pm flight was so large they had a separate side queue area before you got to the queues at the front of the desks. Credit to the 5 desk staff there though it did move reasonably quickly. My in-flight experience was supposedly better than normal due to them issuing a free upgrade to "premium" entertainment which was frankly poor in comparison with other airlines I've recently flown to USA with (Delta, Icelandair). On the return I had 5 films to choose from. Food was ok, but no complimentary drinks except a bottle of water and trolley drinks are expensive. There was a constant push to sell you stuff - you have to sit through 4 adverts back to back before you can watch anything. It really is like long haul Ryanair but with a stricter baggage policy. It took an hour after landing for my bag to come into reclaim so having got through immigration that was a 40minute wait, meaning I missed a train connection by 2mins. The gate from JFK also had no seats and we had to be bussed out across to the plane which was miles away. In summary - a totally budget experience which could be so much better if they could sort out check in and be slightly more reasonable on hand luggage weight allowance.

### "the most uncomfortable trip"
Dalaman to Luton. This has to be the most uncomfortable trip I have ever made, legroom was a huge issue as there wasn’t any. This flight was operated by Avion Express although the Thomas Cook livery was everywhere. The flight attendants seemed to be having a bad day with one in particular very snappy and barking orders at passengers and then shaking her head and making comments about them just loud enough to be heard. The food was typical of any airline and had to be prepaid. I haven’t used Thomas Cook in a number of years and now I remember why.

### "not have 6 months left on passport"
I purchased a full package holiday to Egypt for December 2017 (Birmingham to Hurghada) and was offered at a cost for Thomas cook to obtain our visas. I agreed as I had no time to check and sort them. I received a document 4 weeks before saying I had a pre-paid visa. I arrived at the airport excited to travel was allowed to check my bags and spend nearly 3 hours in the airport only to be to at boarding that I was being refused travel due to not have 6 months left on my passport. I showed my visa confirmation issued by their company but was still turned away. They are now taking no responsibility for anything and I am down £1300.

### "Overall not a pleasant flight"
Manchester to Varadero, Cuba. Never used this airline before, but had no reason to think it would be any different to the many long haul flights we have taken over the years. Wrong! We had no idea we were flying with a long haul version of Ryanair. Nice clean plane, decent amount of leg room with rather uncomfortable seats. We had had to pay £25 each way to choose our seats or risk the real possibility of having to sit separately on a 10 hour flight, which had already added £100 to the cost of holiday. The overhead lockers are quite small, and the baggage allowance is a measly 20kg hold and 6kg hand luggage which is strictly adhered to. On the return journey we were 1.2kg overweight, and were charged £20 by the completely inflexible ground staff - no receipt given, and cash only payment. Have been overweight by this trivial amount several times on other airlines, but have never ever been charged! Disgusting daylight robbery. On board we got settled in and once in the air the drinks trolley came. We were charged £2.80 for a cup of tea! I thought it was a joke , but everything was to pay for, at 10 times the cost of the supermarket (1.30 for a kit kat!) The only free drinks were a bottle of water on the outbound flight (none on the return) and the tea with the two meals, which was half the size of the one you had to buy. We also got a complimentary cornetto on the outbound flight, which was so small it was gone in two bites. The out meals were quite nice, coming back the breakfast consisted of a yoghurt and a cake, Who eats cake for breakfast? Turns out we do, because we are starving ! The headsets were free but poor quality, the entertainment was rubbish, uless you wanted to pay an extra £5 for a better choice of films etc. The cabin crew were pleasant enough if a little disinterested. Overall not a pleasant flight, and not only will we never use this airline again, we would not recommend it either.

### "crew not happy to be there"
Manchester to Ft Lauderdale via New York JFK. This booking was made via the Thomas Cook call centre, with a 2 hour connection in JFK from the Thomas Cook Airlines flight which landed in T4 to a JetBlue domestic flight to Fort Lauderdale which departed from T5. As you would expect in the USA, we knew we would have to collect our bags at JFK, clear customs and them drop on another belt for connecting flights. Not at JFK apparently! The first sector of our flight from Manchester to JFK was operated by Air Tanker, which I had low expectations of, but actually a fairly decent newish aircraft. However, the cabin crew operating the flight clearly were not happy to be there. From the moment we stepped on board we had to listen to 3 of them stood by the exit door where we sat, constantly moaning about their terms and conditions and how they should not be asked to operate as Senior Crew on the Air Tanker plane as they were not experienced on it (correct me if I'm wrong, but its the same type as they operate in their own fleet?). It was terribly unprofessional. One of the passengers must have been Cabin Crew staff going on holiday and must also have been the Union Shop Steward or something as she stood with them telling them all how she's written to head office to complain etc. It was just awful and off putting to listen to! By the time we were due to take off, there was then a hive of activity in the hold and they began loading baggage and cargo... at the time we were supposed to take off! This took them over an hour to complete, so we took off 1hr 20mins late! Clearly this flight actually going was a surprise to the baggage handlers as they hadn't prepared for it! Knowing we had a short connection at JFK we asked the cabin crew for advice on what to do. They had no idea on how connections worked at JFK as I forgot - they're basically a charter airline trying to play scheduled service. We landed at JFK over an hour late. We were met by a member of ground staff who handed us a "speedy transfer card" which was supposed to expedite our journey through the usual miles of queues at US airports. However, it was about as useful as waving a piece of loo roll at someone! There is no facility to drop you bags through for a connecting flight, so by the time we ran back, we missed our connecting flight! There is no Thomas Cook representative at JFK T4 until 3hrs before the flight leaves, which is really not helpful when you're going to miss your last hope of a connection! Eventually we got hold of someone in the UK at Thomas Cook and got rebooked, but not without a lot of stress and worrying we may not even make our cruise leaving the next day out of Fort Lauderdale! We found the Thomas Cook aircraft on the way back was very tired, uncomfortable, dated and worn. The service outbound and return was minimal, with just one drinks round offered on a 7hr flight to me just says lazy! We were encourged to buy everything we wanted on the one round, then what do you do with it all! The food has gone really down hill. Bland, tasteless and minimal effort. It was never this bad a couple of years ago! I will not travel with this airline again as they clearly have no concept of offering connecting flights and minimum connections times. My whole holiday could very well have been ruined by them if I hadn't intervened.

### "one of the worst airlines"
Gatwick to Palma. This is possibly one of the worst airlines I’ve ever flown with. Rude boarding staff and unreasonable policies. The price given is totally misleading as the hand luggage cannot weigh more than 6kg. All bags are weighed religiously - the atmosphere is unpleasant and the whole experience makes you regret ever dreaming of a holiday. You got charged £65 one way for having a weekend bag 2.5kg over this ridiculous limit. This means that everyone is expected to have a check in bag which of course takes the original price way up and therefore not competitive. Absolutely ruined the long weekend. Thanks Thomas Cook. That’s the last time I fly with you.

### "far below standard expected"
I recently flew with Thomas Cook Airlines to and from Barbados from Gatwick Premium Economy with my wife in seat 5F/5G. I paid £300 pp. I have never had such an awful pair of flights. I have to say the staff were great but the food was terrible with plastic cutlery. The extras ie earphones were disgrace and in general the whole experience was far below the standard expected for this service. I have traveled using Thomson/Tui and found them to be at a different level of service and comfort. This is a sad reflection to the airline and was never worth the money,

### "did an excellent job"
Tenerife to Bristol. Despite the weather we returned to our home airport just three hours late, one of about two planes to land in Bristol yesterday, and we were kept informed by staff from the moment we arrived at Tenerife South Airport. Credit where it is due, the pilot and cabin crew did an excellent job.

### "journey was a little uncomfortable"
Tenerife to Manchester. Due to a medical circumstance missed my original flight home and could only secure Premium Economy with Thomas Cook the following day. Expensive for 2 one way tickets but no choice really. You get a generous baggage allowance 25kg, selected seating, free drinks on board and a meal. The flight boarded on time, I was a little taken aback how minimal the legroom was, there was no additional space for premium economy, whilst I wasn’t expecting a suite or a flat bed, I was expecting at least an inch extra, but no. The 4 hour journey was a little uncomfortable, thankfully the lady in front didn’t recline her seat, I would have been in big trouble if she had. I don’t understand why airlines on short haul Europe still have reclining seats with such small leg room provided. Meal was very tasty and the cabin crew were excellent, very friendly and provided a real service, not a scratch card sale insight.

### "a very uncomfortable and expensive trip"
Flew Thomas Cook from Goa to London Gatwick. Will never use this airline again. My partner and I booked our very expensive premium economy tickets 11 months in advance of our trip so that we could have a two seat together. Unfortunately he had to return to the UK enexpectedly a week before our trip was up. There was no flexibility in his ticket so he paid for another full price ticket. Fair enough, his choice. Problems started when I went to the airport alone a week later. Was refused entry into the airport as mine was not the lead name, after a panicky 40 minutes, myself and the police finally found someone from Thomas Cook and I was escorted into the airport. At the check in I was asked if I wanted seat 2a or 2c as they were in the process of selling my partners ticket for which he had not been able to change or gain a refund. I was fairly dismayed that I would have to sit next to a complete stranger on a night flight as we had booked these tickets specifically to avoid this. As it happened, I ended up with an empty seat next to me. This was a night flight taking off at 2am, so I wanted to settle down fairly quickly to try and sleep, 30 minutes into the flight, there was a lot of commotion in the seats behind and a stewardess woke me up to tell me that someone's TV screen wasn't working and so she was going to be moved to sit next to me. It took another thirty minutes to move her, after another few minutes I was tapped on the shoulder once again to be asked by a stewardess to move to the seats behind as she was travelling with her husband and I was alone. This was now 3.30am. I explained that I was now starting to get very irritated as we had paid for two seats together and neither of us would be sitting in either, and I didn't really want to move to another seat in a longer row. Eventually due the pressure and awkwardness I felt I did get up and move. Needless to say, I did not sleep on this flight and it was a very uncomfortable and expensive trip. A complaint was made to Thomas Cook. The reply was in badly written English with spelling mistakes saying that I should have made a request for any compensation to the air stewardess! And as I had moved "voluntarily " then they didn't see what the issue is. The crew on the plane were good, the customer service and ethics of this company is unacceptable. People should vote with their feet, which is why I shall never use this airline again. To not have even received a sorry shows the arrogance, and contempt for their customers. We are not treated as human beings at all by this company.

### "couldn't have been more impressed"
Having read lots of bad reviews for this airline, we booked with trepidation. There were very few direct flights from Cancun-London and prices were typically almost 3-times Thomas Cook's. We decided even if we encountered a nightmare delay or other problems other have had, we'd still be ahead. As it was, we were able to upgrade to Premium for £40 each. What a bargain! The new Terminal 4 at Cancun is much less chaotic than the others and for Thomas Cook there were two dedicated Premium check-in desks. Our cabin-baggage was slightly overweight but when I explained it contained my warm gear for the flight they let it go. No Fast-track, but security was fine. Premium passengers did board first and this was smooth except that overhead bag space is unusually small. My "normal" sized bag which would usually go in length-wise had to be put in sideways to fit. Several other people had the same issue, so space was very tight. We were offered sparkling wine while waiting; then, once in the air, were soon offered another drink and then another. The service of our crew was excellent - I have flown business class on Virgin Australia, Singapore and Virgin Atlantic and service was up there with those! Not so the food, of course, but it was surprisingly good. Better than any economy class meal I've ever eaten, so I would say it's a cut about whatever is served in the rear. Even the wine was drinkable. I took a peak behind the curtain more than once as the front toilet was occupied for an extended period. The seat config was 2-4-2 rather than the 2-3-2 of premium. The extra width is noticeable and the leg-room was fine for me too (at 6'1"). Flight departed approximately on time an arrived half-an-hour early. Couldn't have been more impressed by the experience for the money.

### "decent for a holiday airline"
East Midlands to Tenerife South. Very slow bag drop at both airports. Planes both ways pretty much to schedule. Friendly crews with one exception on the outward leg. As noted before with this airline, the aisles are blocked for much of the trip with the crew selling drinks, then meals and then duty free. The £20 extra legroom seats are a bargain for anyone tall; the passengers in the standard seats looked very cramped. A decent service for a holiday airline.

### "the worst flight experience"
Thomas Cook Airlines, the worst flight experience I've ever had. Our flight was behind schedule by 1 hour and 30mins, we had to go through customs and when we went to get our luggage to catch our connection flight, they already had our bags pulled to the side and told us we weren't going to make the connection. So they gave my wife and I a piece of paper that had our names on it, our bag info and there was another piece of paper stapled to it that had a hotel name and number to call to get a shuttle. It also said "booked", even the guy told us that we had a room booked and we just needed to call the shuttle. So we got to the hotel and there wasn't a room booked for us, and we had to pay for our own room which was $200. We also had to pay luggage storage at the airport which was almost another $100. I was told by Thomas Cook since our flight wasn't 3 hours or more delayed that they don't need to pay us back. Their baggage fees are crazy and you can't have a carry-on of more than 6kg, which was crazy because they didn't care when we went to Manchester. My carry-on was pretty much empty so we had to pay extra for our other bags being 6lbs over. $200 fee total. Would rather pay extra to have better customer service!

### "Avoid this airline at all costs"
Flew Manchester to Orlando. Thomas Cook, across the Atlantic, a long haul version of Ryanair. I have flown across the Atlantic on countless occasions, from the days of Freddie Laker, Pam Am, Monarch etc., to more recent credible airlines, such as Virgin, BA and recently Thomson’s, and must say my flight with Thomas Cook was by far and away the worst I have ever experienced. A total of over three hours of delays, no apologies, no consideration. Rude staff, poor food, charges for every little item, £5 for a coffee or a warm beer, no offering of water, completely contradictory to medical advice not to allow dehydration on board a plane, £3 for headphones, an extra £5 for entertainment, no rear seat screens, you are told to download an App to your device but no charging points provided. The Thomas Cook Clone "airtanker" from Manchester must be the most dated plane flying the Atlantic. Avoid this airline at all costs, rubbish service.

### "impressed with the flight"
Manchester to Los Angeles. Really impressed with the flight. I was dreading the 11 hour flight but the cabin was spacious, decent legroom, the staff were really efficient and friendly and the food was edible & frequent (though better on the way out, their us supply chain has a way to go). Decent selection of films if you upgrade (only £5), tv and music. I would recommend Thomas Cook if you can get a good deal but if go with virgin/BA if it's a similar price. On the flight back we were given a pillow/blanket each (night flight) and the toilets were down a set of stairs so a good space to stretch, the premium films were all free on the way back. I think if a good sleep is an absolute necessity pay for premium as the seats looking to recline more and looking more comfortable.

### "abandoned by Thomas Cook at Orlando"
Cancun to Glasgow via Orlando. We had a great holiday received a call on the Friday morning saying our flight was cancelled and that we were boarding a flight from Mexico to Orlando on the Saturday morning. Paper work was deployed through our door in the Friday night half our last day was taken up by helping the 14 other people in our party who didn’t have ESTA for USA. We were chartered to airport at 9am in the morning for our flight and landed in Orlando at 16:20. We were instructed to go to a phone call the hotel and await our shuttle. After over an hr a shuttle appeared took around 6 people to Marriott hotel and came back. The driver asked if we were all going to Marriott airport hotel which all 60 of us said yes. He promptly called the hotel who advised we had no hotel reservations and there were no rooms for us. We were at this point very anxious and stress no to mention over heating. We were outside this airport for 4 hrs getting dark no water or food and no rep in sight. We managed to track down a Swissport employee who helped us with food vouchers and after another hour in airport we were told a hotel had been found and we would be picked up at airport. In the morning the management at our hotel eventually managed to get it touch with Thomas Cook and at 12am we were informed a bus would pick us up at 1pm to go to airport for our flight. On arrival to airport the flight had been delayed until 18:30 On return from our ordeal I called and complained I was offered compensation but turned it down my case was immediately cancelled by the airline and I was instructed to get in touch with CEDR. We had 2 disputes one the cancellation the other abandonment lack of information and stress and anxiety. We were awarded the flight delay money but rejected £100 compensation CEDR looked at our claim and awarded up £29 compensation what an absolute joke and disgrace I will be fighting this so will the other people abandoned by Thomas Cook at Orlando airport.

### "very poor service"
Manchester to Portland via New York JFK. Good points: Smooth flights and food okay. Bad points: Booked premium economy at approx £500 extra, as it was our first long haul journey. Arrived at the airport and checked in, no problem. After going through security, found that our first flight was delayed by two hours. No problem as we had a four hour layover at JFK. During the flight, drinks were 'included" but they only came round once except for a wine with our meal! I know it doesn't specify how many drinks but you do expect more than one service! Just before landing we were informed that a representative from Thomas Cook would be there to assist us with our onward journey, once we had cleared immigration. At immigration we were told we had to collect our cases and check them in with JetBlue for the next leg of our journey. Baggage transfer was also supposed to be included in the premium package. We collected our bags and looked for the person from Thomas Cook. We couldn't see them so found our way to the correct terminal and to the JetBlue check in desk. The queue was so long that we missed the flight, despite them putting us in the priority lane. When we reached the desk we were told that we had already been booked on a later flight - instead of travelling at 4.59pm we had been booked on to the 22.40pm flight! Not impressed as you can imagine as we reached our final destination over five hours late. When we arrived at Portland Jetport for the first leg of our return journey we couldn't check in as there was a problem with the ticketing. Even though we had the paperwork and it was showing on the airlines system that we were booked on it, they said a change had been made and they would have to contact Thomas Cook to rectify it. This was taking ages and at one point, the JetBlue staff said it would be unlikely that we would make the flight. We eventually got our boarding passes and made it to gate just 15 minutes before it opened! After a five hour layover at JFK we were finally on the last leg. Only one drinks service on the return journey, even though it was a night flight, would have been good to be offered tea or coffe or other soft drink. Stressful, annoying and very poor service considering we paid £1600 inc the upgrade to premium.

### "a bargain and the flight was fine"
Boston to Manchester with a scheduled departure time of 17:35 with an arrival time of 04:55 the next morning. I checked on the punctuality of this route and found that the plane often took off about 15 minutes early but almost always arrived on time or a bit earlier. That was the case with my flight. Cabin baggage in economy is limited to 6 kg. My carry on bag was easily 15 kg but since I was not checking a bag I figured that once I checked in I would simply print my boarding pass and go directly to the gate. I know Logan airport well and there are no scales at the gates. But I was wrong. It is impossible to print a boarding pass from home. Everyone must go to the check in counter. Because of this, I had to check in one bag and make sure that my carry on was under 6 kg. I also put my laptop in another small bag which the check in person didn't see. Once my bag was weighted no one ever questioned it or inspected it. I could have had a friend waiting for me and simply stuffed my bag after checking in, or simply left my bag with my friend and arrived with no bag whatsoever. So beware. You must be careful as they weigh all carry on bags at Boston. The flight was fine. Free meal (chicken or beef) and free muffin and coffee before landing. Everything else costs money. Cans of beer were 4GBP! No individual screens on the seat backs, just drop down screens like in the 1970s. No problem. Seats were a bit tight but otherwise fine. Staff was lovely. For 139GBP one way from Boston to the UK, it was a bargain. Great deal and I would fly them again. Just bring a book or some thing to keep you occupied. Bring a bottle of water. I would fly them again because it's a bargain and the flight was fine.

### "extremely disappointed"
Zakynthos to Newcastle. Outbound to Zakynthos couldn’t be faulted, however on the route back we were delayed by 23 hours and not given any information-  for the majority of the 23 hours we slept on an airport floor for 10 hours with little money and food and the airport didn’t offer a lot of food. We arrived at the airport at 3am and weren’t put in accommodation or food until 4pm. We then didn’t get into an accommodation to sleep in till 8pm after being told we would be leaving at 6pm. Due to the delay we were told we would be given €400 compensation within 28 days it is now 56+ days later and none of my party have received this compensation even after multiple phone calls to Thomas Cook extremely disappointed with this service.

### "solid experience on both flights"
Solid experience on both flights. They were punctual and the staff onboard were very approachable and chatty, including the captain on the return flight. He introduced himself personally in the cabin and was humorous. It relaxed everybody. The meals were good. The airline heavily promotes its collaboration with the chef James Martin and this was reflected in some tasty food. I would give this category full marks if they were less stingy in the portion sizes, and I also think they should make a wine or beer one of the drink options with the meal, rather than just tea / coffee. We are paying extra after all. The airline's bag drop facility at Manchester is excellent. I'd sent my hold luggage and received my boarding pass within five minutes of entering the terminal. Also received the luggage in good time upon arrival for both flights. A few negatives. IFE outdated. Shared screens showing the ubiquitous Big Bang Theory. Cleanliness - the cabin on the return flight was grubby with coffee stains on the backs of seats and used packets of butter on the floor + lots of crumbs. General stains and dust showed that it had been a while since the plane received a thorough clean. The aeroplane on the return flight was newer (sharklets) and seat spacing was definitely more cramped than on the outbound. It seems the airline has tried to squeeze in more seats in its newer models, and it became uncomfortable after a while. I say this as a man of average height. It was also muggy. I noticed that the heating controls were set to 22 degrees, and that's too warm for squeezed-in passengers. All-in-all, two decent flights and I'd fly Thomas Cook again.

### "decided not to load 127 bags"
I flew from Newcastle on 11/09/17 to Hurghada. Thomas Cook decided not to load 127 bags so the plane which was late could get into the air quicker, no one knew until about 40 minutes before landing, the pilot announced a load of rubbish about their supposed to follow on a following flight, there isn't one.Thomas Cook will say anything to keep people quiet, and claim they are giving out information, if it's factually inaccurate. So you fill out a form with all your details on Thomas Cook will do nothing with this, they claimed our luggage would be couriered first thing the next day this was a lie, they were on a late flight from Gatwick. Thomas Cook absolutely refused to give any local rep details. I spent the first day of my holiday in the hotel lobby trying to find out any information, my 1st days diving cancelled, so after several web chats, with people either unwilling of unable to absolutely anything like tell me where my stuff is and a couple of FB messenger chats I finally call it quits at 0130 still no luggage. Wednesday 3 days in I go off diving returning to my hotel at about 8pm still no luggage - nothing from Thomas Cook no email, no phone calls no response. I happen to find out totally by chance I would have to take a taxi to Hurghada airport myself with boarding cards passport and luggage tags - if I didn't have any of these no bags. In a nut shell Thomas Cook will take your money to take you on holiday & not bother loading all your holiday stuff to save a bit of time, you are an afterthought, they will not support you in the slightest give you the required information to solve a problem, nothing - you are on your own.

### "I won't give them another chance"
We have used Thomas Cook Airlines on two occasions - both to visit Orlando and both with a long delay on the return journey. It took 12 years to have the confidence to use them again after a 24 plus hour delay - 3 small children 1-6 years in age left in a hotel more suited to business travellers wasn't ideal. Sadly, they failed to offer a satisfactory service this year too - a 5.5 hour delay, without the provision of food and drink we were entitled to. Put a claim in and guess what - it was due to congestion, which was out of their control! I won't give them another chance.

### "waiting in line for 4 hours"
Amsterdam to Boston via Manchester. If I could give negative stars I would. The airline kept us all waiting in line for 4 hours after canceling the flights. After my 4 hours in line I arrive at the front the lady on the phone lines tried to say they refunded my ticket and I don't exist. This is all after I checked in got boarding passes and received a seat number. Still waiting on them to learn how to rescheduled a flight.

### "worth the extra money"
Manchester to Cayo Coco. The selection of movies, TV shows and music were fantastic, and free drinks. The crew were excellent on both flights extremely helpful. We both received an amenity kit both ways with blankets and pillows. The upgraded meals were delicious. The seat pitch and width were great and the legroom was the best I ever had. Premium is worth the extra money.

### "Nice smooth flight"
Newcastle to Corfu. Flight left around 10-15 mins late due to air traffic control restriction. Quick ascent, seatbelt signs turned off very quickly. Seat were ok, a little cramped if you are tall but the seat itself was comfortable. Like the fact they have made the backs rigid plastic so if people go into the pockets on the back the person in front shouldn't really feel it. There was overhead screens which initially showed the route map and later turned into a children's film. One drink and snack round before meal was served about 1hr 30mins into flight. Could have been a little quicker as the flight set off at 5.30am and everyone was ready for breakfast. Nice smooth flight, a few announcements from captain when we flew over the stunning alps. Flight was uneventful. Meal was good, I enjoyed the breakfast and it was served with tea coffee or juice. Flight home was great as well, food was good although if I was being picky the portions were small but you do get crackers, cheese, a bread roll and a small pudding to make up for the hot meal being small. Drinks and snacks are expensive just like any other airline. Usual sales pitch on duty free goods, not many takers on our flight. Toilets were clean and functioning. I find Thomas cook fine for these short journeys. We have gone with them long haul on the larger planes to Vegas and we found them fine for the price. We would fly with them again.

### "I was pleasantly surprised"
Manchester to San Francisco. I was wary of flying Thomas Cook because I'd never flown with them before and had heard it was something of a discount airline, minimum frills. But I was pleasantly surprised! We had one complimentary meal and tea, along with coffee/tea. Interestingly we also got little ice cream cones as a further snack. Although further food/drinks had to be purchased, this seemed fair considering the low ticket price. Boarding was smooth, we arrived nearly on time, and the pilot very kindly pointed out when we were flying over some nice views - including Greenland. I was impressed considering the price and convenience of a direct flight between the UK and SFO.

### "no concern or interest"
Manchester to Boston and onward flight to Philadelphia with Jetblue. As a previous reviewer described in their situation, check in for Thomas Cook was mobbed on my return flight originating in Manchester. The only thing that saved me from waiting in the outrageously long que was having paid for a premium seat. As he was checking me in, the representative did not inform me that the flight had had a change of aircraft and would not be offering premium service. He also did not inform me that my luggage was not checked all the way through and that I would have to pick it up in Boston and check it in again, another mob scene. I learned of the change in my flight when I noticed a pile of papers on the counter and read about it there. A refund was promised and a link to an online form to obtain it given. Questions to the company representative "helping" me from behind the counter were met with rudeness. Others were not so fortunate and were informed for the first time while actually on the flight. At this stage I have gone through numerous contortions in attempting to obtain the promised refund of the additional charge for premium service. The online form seems deliberately designed to rebuff non UK residents, it only accepts UK addresses. Thomas Cook has no telephone number in the US. Although I found one listed online as being theirs, the first time I tried it was answered by someone telling me that it was a Thomas Cook line only at a certain time of day. When I called back at the time I was told to, I was informed it is never a Thomas Cook line at any time of day. This is a great way to communicate to your US customers that they are of no importance to you, Thomas Cook. Eventually, I managed to make contact through email, both requesting my refund and reporting about my horrible in flight experience, which included not being offered an unpaid beverage outside the meal service- on a transatlantic flight (while standing in the long line of people attempting to get a boarding pass in Boston, I chatted with someone who'd been in the regular economy class on the same flight who told me they had been offered complimentary beverages twice outside of meal services). When we were offered the chance to purchase beverages, water was not offered. I felt I was reduced to begging for it, and was handed a tiny plastic cup of water each time I did. I eventually did hear back from the company by email, requesting the information they needed to deposit the money into my bank account. There was no concern or interest expressed in the ordeal I had outlined on the flight in regard to beverages or at the connecting airport where I was given incorrect information by the person accepting my luggage back in wearing a Thomas Cook uniform. Her lack of knowledge resulted in my standing in a line unnessarily and wasting my precious time on the layover. To date, no refund has been provided. When I wrote again to the same email address stating this, I recieved a response stating that I "had been offered a CHAPS payment" and that they considered the matter to be resolved. No payment has been recieved.

### "crew was very pleasant"
We had an exceptional flight with Thomas Cook Airlines from Orlando to Manchester. My girlfriend and I flew premium economy, which was well worth the money for the extra legroom. The plane was very modern which great entertainment options built into the seat in front of you. Flight crew was very pleasant and the food was even better. Drinks were all complimentary and they had an excellent selection of premium beverages. I was very surprised by what a great flight we had and will definitely recommend Thomas Cook to our family and friends.

### "Thomas Cook passed the buck"
Gatwick to Orlando. This is what check-in at Gatwick Airport looked like on Wednesday  July 19. Hundreds of passengers in the queue. One person at the counter. We arrived early at 8:30 for an 11:00 flight. We waited almost 2 hours to check-in. Therefore we had to rush through the airport to make our flight, bypassing any purchases we intended to make (including food and duty-free items) and bathrooms we intended to visit. Was an explanation given? Only the comment that the check-in desk employees are not Thomas Cook employees so Thomas Cook Airlines took no responsibility. Yes, we were told that. With the Thomas Cook Airline banner over every desk, Thomas Cook Airlines passed the buck. Were any courtesies offered like a complementary beverage on the plane? No. A beautiful first-time holiday in London capped off by an atrocious reception on our departure. With all the competition for the travel dollar to Great Britain, I would hope that Thomas Cook Airlines improves and starts placing customer service highest of their priorities.

### "a very good flight"
Las Vegas to Manchester. My first time flying with Thomas Cook Airlines it was a very good flight. The crew was very polite and charismatic and made sure all my needs where met. One of the flight attendants even gave me a IFE Code free since my debit card wouldn't work with their machines. I flew economy and had good leg room but my knees constantly hit the tray table when I had to move. This was annoying but I only ran into the problem during meal service. The plane arrived on time. The plane had no on-board WIFI but I was asleep for most of the flight so that wasn't to much of a problem. The A330-200 didn't have personal air-vents.

### "now having to fly with Wamos"
Gatwick to Cancun. We had a flight originally leaving Gatwick at 9am. After waking up early to get to the airport I decided to check the flight details to see if there were any minor delays. What I found was a 6 hour delay! We understand delays are now and again part of flying. I'm disappointed but the delay isn't the issue. There is no information anywhere online and no answer from Thomas Cook via phone as to why such a delay. We arrive at the airport as we found out you still have to check in for the original scheduled flight time. We were handed a piece of paper and a voucher for £10 food and drink in the airport. The information explained the plane we originally were using was out of action and we were now having to fly with Wamos. Surely a decision to borrow another airlines plane wouldn't have been made last minute which made us ask why we are only just finding out? First issue we have a £10 voucher -  6 hour delay, and only a £10 voucher. Now fed up of sitting in an airport spending more that we wanted and now slightly bored we started to board. Once in the air after a few attempts to fix the inflight entertainment cabin crew gave up. 10 hours with no entertainment. I'm 5ft 4 and found I had very little leg room and I feel sorry for those people a bit taller. Rude and unhelpful cabin crew. On different occasions the questions were asked of them with responses  'it's not our fault we are doing our best we are having a bad day at least you guys are getting compensation'. We had a meal thrust at us and before we could ask what it was he was off. When asked if we could change it we were told no. Even though other cabin crew were giving people a choice.

### "they let people pick their own seats"
I had to pay $70 to ensure that my boyfriend and I sat next to each other on a 9 hr flight. Our flight was delayed 5 hours (it happens) after which they let people pick their own seats, first come first serve. My boyfriend and I ended up sitting apart. On the flight, they gave my boyfriend two sips of juice in a 3 ounce cup. When he asked for a pepsi they told him he already had a drink and said he couldn't have another one. One drink for a 9 hour flight. I tried to file a complaint to get refunded for the reserved seats, but their online form doesn't work with U.S. addresses for some reason. After an hour of sitting on the phone and getting transferred, they tell me that there is no one to talk to for complaints out of the United States, and to use a UK address for the form. When I told her I didn't have a UK address, they told me "to pick one" and hung up on me.

### "staff became very rude and patronising"
As a seasoned traveller, Thomas Cook is the worst budget airline I have flown on. My flight from Manchester to Mahon was cancelled Sunday to Saturday which meant I lost some money on pre-booked aspects of my travel (i.e. hotel & car hire). However, when Sunday's flight had all the passengers ferrying down the runway, it turned around back to the terminal due to a technical issue. The flight was mainly families with very young children. Everyone was stuck on the plane for 3 hours in the Spanish heat with little explanation. However, I was promised a complimentary tea, once the flight set off. When the flight did set off, I had to wait 2 hours for the drinks trolley to come and they insisted on charging for the tea. When I politely challenged this, the staff became very rude and patronising and refused to give me a tea.

### "I'm extremely annoyed"
Manchester to Preveza. I booked this flight with Thomas Cook in December 20016 and as I'm tall, paid an extra £20 each way for a specific seat plus another £13 for my partner so that she would be next to me. At the beginning of March we were notified that we would be flying with Condor and the times changed slightly, 10 minutes, nothing else was mentioned. Today I set about checking in online and was horrified to find that we had not been allocated the booked seats, instead had got two standard seats. I immediately phoned Thomas Cook as I could not find a number for Condor, and was eventually allocated an extra leg room seat but with my partner 2 rows back. Only after I insisted was I offered a part refund of the £66 seat booking fee I had paid. Now this also means that tomorrow at Manchester, even though we are only taking cabin luggage, we will have to go through the full check-in procedure instead of being able to go straight to security. I'm extremely annoyed at being messed about like this and will not fly Thomas Cook/Condor again.

### "crew very kind and professional"
It was an HCPT charter from London Gatwick to Lour with Thomas Cook Airlines. The flight was comfortable, the cabin crew very kind and professional. The flight left on time such is very rare on HCPT flight. (Keep in mind HCPT is a pilgrimage trust and there are a lot of disabled children). Flight lasted 1.25 hours. We were all singing along the way and at the end we sang a song to thank the cabin manager. We got a hot breakfast with a sausage, egg, tomato, and bacon we also got a cold breakfast consisting of a muffin, orange juice and all the bits to go with a selection of drink.

### "never fly with Thomas Cook again"
Los Angeles to Manchester return. My flight to Manchester was wonderful. The food was good for airlines and the seat comfortable. The return flight a nightmare! My seat was bumped 3 times! I had reserved the seats months before the trip and I was bumped to economy without notification. I called and was told I was placed back in premium. Checked again to 2 days before departure and had no seat. Called again and was told I was in economy! Was told to wait until I arrived at the airport. The attendant told me there was one seat available in Premium in the very front, not window I booked or it would be Economy. I accepted. On the flight I sat next to a very large gentleman and could not barely move my arms as he overlapped into my seat, Barely put up the food tray and eat. The poor man was very embarrassed, I think the seat was to be empty. I will never fly with Thomas Cook again.It was a horrible ending to a great trip!

### "we had to pay for everything"
Manchester to Orlando return. We were appalled to find that we had to pay for everything, which we have never had to do on any long haul flight we had taken in the past. This included headsets (£3) to be able to watch third rate films which costs £5. Drinks were very expensive, with a small can of Stella costing £4.00, J2o £2.50 and water £1.80. We were appalled by the food service which ran out of options on both the outbound and return journey, consequently we were offered the choice of main meals that previous passengers who were served didn't want to eat. You couldn't buy any wine with your meal as these had to be purchased on the drinks service which came around approximately an hour previous, and the meals served weren't served on trays, but in their own containers. The breakfast on the homeward flight was a joke, we were served a small carton of orange juice, a yoghurt, and a granola type snack bar.

### "The staff were incredible"
Orlando to Gatwick. I was told 5 minutes before boarding my flight that my precious 4 year old grandson had died unexpectedly. I was devastated with inconsolable grief. The staff of Thomas Cook Airlines and particularly the cabin manager were incredible. They upgraded me to a private corner so I could grieve privately and looked after me like angels the whole flight and right off the plane to the arms of my waiting relative. Thank you Thomas Cook, you are stars.

### "booked and paid for meals"
❎ Unverified |  My husband and I flew return to Tenerife with Thomas Cook Airlines. We booked and paid for meals on both the outbound and inward flights. When we expected to get these meals the staff had no record of it so were left without. The cabin crew manager on the return flight was very haughty and made us feel we were trying to claim something we werent entitled to. Another customer in front of us also expected to get a meal and he also was let down. We will not be travelling with Thomas Cook again and have now booked our next flight to Lanzarote with Jet2 fly.

### "a very good product"
Used Thomas Cook Airlines from London to Cape Town Return in their Premium Class. I was worried as their reviews were very mixed - I must say I was impressed by their Premium Cabin and the staff looking after it. Priority check-in, priority boarding and a decent sized seat - wider than BA's Premium product although only 35in legroom which felt spacious enough. A few small issues - they ran out of a specific meal choice by the time they came to us (we sat in Row 1A/C) which was annoying but nothing big as the meals were tasty and drinks were plentiful. Row 1 does not have the same leg room as the rest of the Premium Cabin, due to the bulkhead in front, you cannot stretch your legs out! The in-flight entertainment system is basic in terms of offerings but it was included in Premium (in economy you have to pay £4.50 to unlock it). On the way back we had row 7 and it felt much more comfortable being able to stretch out your legs under the seat in front. All in all, a very good product which I will definitely use again and highly recommend - being able to fly direct from Gatwick to Cape Town and still pay the equivalent BA economy fare and get Premium is an added bonus. Well done Thomas Cook - see you again soon.

### "always pretty punctual and very good value for money"
❎ Unverified |  We travel with Thomas Cook most winters on long haul holidays, I find them a pretty good airline, long flights especially overnight are never the best but the crews are always helpful and attentive. We have had to use special assistance before when my partner had to travel to and from Barbados with a leg in cast - spot on, gave us extra leg room seats and looked after him well. The James Martin meals are always spot on too although inbound from USA and Cape Town you don't get the James Martin meals and can tell. The inflight entertainment is dire these days though unless you pay extra which we refuse to do and make do with a good book. Basically you get two adults films in economy and two kids films and they are the same ones out and in bound. We just came back from Cape Town which is 12 hours each way so 2 films for 24 hours of flying! Would happily fly with them again though overall, always pretty punctual and very good value for money when you compare ticket prices to other airlines.

### "the cabin crew service was very poor"
I flew from Gatwick to Cape Town on the 25 Dec which was not a good experience, and ended up more expensive than any of the main long haul airlines. If Thomas Cook is going to fly long haul they need to follow the example of long haul airlines. We were charged £40 for baggage each way, £3 for headset, £5 for the movies which were old, £4.50 for a drink even for water. The food was terrible, we did not even have a choice, ran out before they got to us. The cabin crew service was very poor, at one stage there was three drinks trolleys in a row, extremely disorganised. The return trip on 10 Jan was much better, the cabin crew and food much improved. I feel if Thomas Cook wants to charge for everything as they do for short haul flights, passengers need to be notified as this is not the normal procedure. I very much doubt I will use this airline for long haul flights again.

### "the lack of communication"
We flew from Gatwick to Banjul on Christmas day as part of a Thomas Cook holiday. The bag drop was OK because we were early so no queues yet. That was about as good as it got. There was too much hand luggage on the flight for the luggage space and so we were having to cram it in wherever we could (and it was already cramped!). Thomas Cook had not checked the size of the hand luggage and some people had huge bags. The flight was 20 minutes late departing with no explanation or apology; instead we got an announcement that the plane wasn't carrying enough fuel to reach our destination due to the wind being in the wrong direction and the amount of passengers/luggage on board. So the plane clearly wasn't big enough for the job. We would have to stop off at Gran Canaria to refuel, turning a 6 hour flight into a 7.5 hour flight. We were offered no free refreshments, not even water so we paid £8 for some cheese and crispbreads, a miniscule packet of crisps and a small 125cl bottle of wine - their special offer meal deal. It was a joke! The return flight was even worse - a complete disaster. We got to the airport around 18:30, check in again was OK, friendly and fairly efficient. We had a meal and a drink and waited. The flight was scheduled for 21:05 departure and we saw the plane arrive at around 20:10, a little late but nothing too terrible. We watched all the passengers and crew get off and the baggage being unloaded and just waited for the announcement that we could board but nothing was happening. By about 21:30 and still no announcements or sign of anyone to ask, the passengers were getting restless and beginning to complain amongst themselves. Just after 22:00 the announcement came that there was a delay which was due to a bird strike on landing and that the technicians were working on it. Why did they take so long to announce this? Shortly after this they handed out food vouchers for the airport cafe to the value of 250 Delasi (about £5 per person) We did not rush to the cafe as we had already eaten. There was then another announcement that they had fixed the plane but had to wait for an engineer from Airbus to inspect it and approve the aircraft for flight. I accept that none of this was Thomas Cook's fault and the fact that we were in the Gambia and they were fresh out of aeronautical engineers, but surely by this stage, or even an hour earlier, someone should have made the decision that there was no way that flight was going anywhere tonight! Anyway, it was now approaching 23:00 and we joined the long queue for food, only to find out that they had sold out of everything except pringles and chocolate. Approaching midnight they gave up on an engineer and arranged buses to take us to hotels for the night. We eventually took off at just after 14:00 the following day after a few more minor annoyances and being told it would be 12:00. Once more the flight was cramped with not enough room for hand luggage. My biggest complaint is the length of time it took to make a decision and the lack of communication to passengers.

### "uncomfortable and unenjoyable"
I flew from London Gatwick to Cape Town on MT2608. I have never had such an uncomfortable and unenjoyable flight before as this one. My seat was broken for the entire flight, meaning I couldn't sleep at all, my request to change seats was ignored until I was finally told that the flight was full and that I could have a free tonic water as a goodwill gesture from them. Following my outbound flight, while trying to discuss the issues I experienced flying out, I learnt more about the ridiculous rules and regulations that Thomas Cook Airlines practice which have been designed to ensure that the customer has absolutely no rights or satisfaction - complaints are only responded 28 days after they're sent, and you're subject to their T&C's no matter what the incident was that occurred. I would warn anyone who expects a certain standard of comfort or respect while travelling long distances to avoid Thomas Cook Airlines wherever possible.

### "please try to up your game"
Thomas Cook are offering more and more long haul flights but in comparison to scheduled flights they are terrible. If you don't pay the 80 round trip extra to sit together as a couple you end up being split up. The headphones you pay for are extra and the films are old ones usual on Netflix. The meals James Martin should be ashamed to put his name too are dried up slop. The sandwiches are dried bread with very little filling. The price of drinks and snacks are outrageous. Pleasse if you are trying to go into long haul in a big way they need to include better meals, entertainment and perhaps a couple of free drinks. They are not really cheaper than most of the schedules and only choose them because they offer more direct flights from Manchester. Please try to up your game and stop charging for so many extras. The difference in price between Thomas Cook and British Airways to Barbados is negligible but the service is enormous. The only reason for choosing TC is that they fly from Manchester.

### "all Thomas Cook can do is add stress to the process"
The second time that I have booked Thomas Cook Airlines for a Ski trip, and if another carrier served Innsbruck I would not use TC. Last year I couldn't book Skis, seats or luggage on because the online booking system had failed, it took 45 minutes on two calls to get this done, so almost as long as the flight itself. This year is worse, they now advertise on the online extras booking that you can add skis, so several attempts bring up error message, displaying a number to call for assistance, followed by long hold times, terrible line in some remote call centre, poor understanding and communication. Eventually the assistant goes through the bag and seat reservation, and then asks the dimensions of the skis, something that I have never been asked! She gets around this, takes payment details, and then disappears, without trace, no call back, no confirmation. So I call again, same process, but no dimensions this time, she takes payment details puts me on hold to then tell me that Skis are not permitted on the flight! It is a ski flight to Innsbruck. I ask for a supervisor 20 minute hold, and guess what no supervisor answers I hang up, and try online chat. Again same process they agree its not a problem, until they try to make payment, again I am now told that they cannot confirm caring skis before departure, and that if I take them to the airport they may carry them. And if they don't? And no doubt at an increased cost. I am returning with Monarch, and have paid £45 to bring my Skis home, but can't get them there. I incorporate my review from Jan 2016 also. We all work hard to buy our holidays, and all Thomas Cook can do is add stress to the process, be warned! Book it with another carrier don't Thomas Cook it.

### "seats are not comfortable"
Terrible experience with Thomas Cook Airlines from Banjul to Gatwick. We were an hour late taking off for no apparent reason. Then the captain informed us in a very brusque manner that we were stopping off at Las Palmas and if we didn't like it we would just have to put up with it. Apparently we were stopping at Las Palmas for fuel because we may have had to stack at Gatwick. One asked the question why we did not take on fuel at Banjul, maybe the airlines credit card was at its limit. On the way the first officer said we would be maximum 39 minutes on the ground at Las Palmas but turned out to have more than an hours delay during which time baggage was moved from the front to the back of the aircraft and when the cabin crew were asked why they could not explain. The captain was asked the reason why and his response was to maintain the centre of gravity of the aircraft. Again one asks how far you can move the centre of gravity of about 30 tonnes of aircraft with 5 suitcases. We then flew into Gatwick with no problems. The seats are not comfortable with minimal leg room but there is a charge for wide aisles. Food is extra, drinks are extra, ear phones are extra not that you would want to watch the in flight entertainment. The aircraft was cold and we all sat in coats. As a frequent traveller I can honestly say I will never travel with Thomas Cook again.

### "it was a dreadful journey"
Manchester to Barbados. Disappointed before we started. Tried to change seats using online system 1 week before, which was not possible. We were advised to do this when we arrived at the airport, which we did. My husband suffers with back problems and for long journeys need extra leg room. We were told he could have a seat with additional leg room which cost £70. We were told if you book in advance it is a lot cheaper. The seats were uncomfortable and did not recline. There were additional charges for upgraded films as well as the necessary earphone. We have never had to pay additional charges for these facilities on the many other long haul flights we have done. There were also charges for drinks and despite pre booking a vegetarian meal, I was told I will have wait to see if there is one available. I was made to feel a nuisance. It was a dreadful journey. Before leaving Barbados my husband, as advised tried to pre book a seat with additional leg room. Again this was not easy and had to ring the following day. After 23 minutes of being on the phone he was told it would cost £65 which we refused to pay. As with the outbound journey, there were available seats, including seats with extra leg room which others were offered once airborne despite asking before the flight took off. Flying with Thomas Cook was no better than flying with a budget airline which is not acceptable for long haul flights. We will not be travelling with Thomas Cook again..

### "unacceptable passenger experience"
Gatwick to Banjul, Gambia is a long route for the A321. The aircraft is set up in high density charter configuration with 220 passengers. Add these 2 factors together and you have a recipe for an unacceptable passenger experience, if any significant head wind is present, especially on the outward sector. I was lucky with 5hrs 20min and 5hr 40min flights, although it was still too high a passenger density in my opinion. The poor unfortunates who were on their outward sector of our return flight were not so lucky, with a stop in Las Palmas due to headwinds taking their flight time to just short of 9hrs! This level of high density seating is Ok for short hops but on a flight of this length it must pose a significant health risk to anyone prone to DVT or other medical issues exacerbated by prolonged enforced activity. The flight was otherwise OK but I will think twice about repeating the uncomfortable experience for the above reasons.

### "outgoing flight attendants"
Great flight from Glasgow to Gran Canaria with Thomas Cook Airlines. The flights were ontime with friendly and outgoing Scottish flight attendants on the aircraft. The choice of food and drink was average but I would use this airline again and recommend it.

### "duty free sales so protracted"
Birmingham to Fuerteventura. First time with Thomas Cook Airlines. The flights operated to or a little ahead of schedule. Captains both ways were chatty and informative. The crew on the outbound flight were friendly; on the way home one crew member clearly wanted to be somewhere else and was more interested in chatting to her mates and reading the paper than doing any passenger-related work. My only grumble is that on the way back the duty free sales process was so protracted that anyone sitting in the middle third of the plane was denied access to any toilet for at least 45 minutes. My wife an I paid the extra £20 each way for emergency exit seats. It was money well spent and we would advise anyone tall(ish) to consider doing the same: legroom in the standard seats looked very cramped. We took our own food so cannot comment on the catering, except to say that the large £2.60 cup of coffee was of decent quality

### "crew were first class"
Belfast to Tenerife return. Just arrived home with Thomas Cook Airlines - fantastic service, everything was on time, in fact both flights were well ahead of times. Cabin crew were first class and did everything with a smile. A great experience.

### "smart, efficient and friendly cabin crew"
In what looked like a newish aircraft, we flew to New York to visit my grandson again. First time with Thomas Cook, will not be the last. We hadn't reserved seats because we are ok if we are seated apart. As it happened, we sat together as a kind young man offered to swap seats. I am over 6 feet tall and the seat room was the best I have had flying economy. In fact it was the best Transatlantic flight to date. Smart, efficient and friendly cabin crew and surprisingly good food, loved the lunchtime bangers and mash. Ok entertainment is a bit minimalistic unless you pay extra and alcoholic drinks are charged for,but, as I try to avoid drinking alcohol on flights, this was not an issue. Well done Thomas Cook, see you again.

### "would definitely use again"
Gatwick to Orlando with Thomas Cook Airlines. After reading some of the reviews I was very nervous however very pleased to admit I was wrong. Had some teething problems due to system upgrade in terms of API input and seat booking however they were resolved by the call centre staff. The plane out was clean and new with biggest leg room I've had for premium economy in recent years. Crew were very attentive and even offered to keep my son's meal hot whilst he slept and they made seveal drinks runs throughout flight. Food out was excellent which is a first for plane food for us. Entertainment was OK but could do with bigger selection. Inbound plane was not as nice but still clean and fresh, however slightly smaller leg room in Premium than outbound flight. Meal was a Sunday roast which was nice touch. Overall at £2000 less than BA and Virgin for Premium it is a no brainier and would definitely use again.

### "a very budget airline"
Myself and my wife flew Manchester to Las Vegas with Thomas Cook as it was the only direct flight we could get at the time. The seats were very uncomfortable for such a long flight. You had to pay for access to the in flight entertainment centre, I think this is shocking! You also had to pay for the drinks service. Thomas Cook is a very budget airline. My advice would be avoid.

### "class this as a budget airline"
Manchester to Orlando return. The plane is only approx 3-6 months old and in good condition. However I would class this as a budget airline because, the entertainment screens etc doesn't have any computer games or facility for a 9hr flight. Four films and six TV shows to choose from, unless you upgrade of course, and pay extra! No choice of main meals either on the way out or back. Take into account the standard of other Long haul flights I have been on with free drinks and games etc (Thomson). The four films and TV programmes on the way back were exactly the same. When I quizzed the crew they told me that the entertainment package stays the same for a couple of months at a time. My view pay a little extra and go with Thomson.

### "worst aircraft I've ever flown"
Hurghada to Gatwick. The worst aircraft I've ever flown, very cramped, and the seats do not recline. For a 5 hour flight, that is the minimum I expect. In flight entertainment would be nice, but I knew it wasn't going to be available. I didn't book a meal in advance as I didn't know if I'd be hungry. I tried to get a cup of tea but was told hot drinks service was only for those that had pre-ordered a meal. But there was time to sell duty free, raffle tickets, anything that made the airline money, but not possible for me to have a cup of tea. Finally, a steward took pity on me feeling ill and got me a hot water so I could make myself a peppermint tea, with my own teabag. I would rather stay home than have to fly on that Thomas Cook plane again. Shockingly bad, with the exception of one steward. Never again. If I could give zero stars I would.

### "spoil your holiday before it starts"
London Stansted to Orlando with Thomas CooK Airlines. Never Again. Problems from the start. We travelled as a party of 8 adults 2 children and 1 infant for a family holiday. Firstly it was impossible to book online - more than 9 in party means you have to use the group booking system, you get into this and it says "less than 10 adults in party you are not a group". I go to the local Thomas Cook shop to book but am quoted a price some £2,000 more than the online price. I question this and am told "We aren't allowed to match the online price but if you phone Thomas Cook Airlines then they can" Not wanting to waste £2,000 I phone to book, online price agreed, and all seemed well until final payment sent and names of passengers submitted, I soon discover that the person I made the booking with, despite me repeating our ticket requirements to ensure all was understood, had somehow managed to miss one person off the booking. It then took me weeks to get someone to sort things out and that was after they kept referring to the "extra passenger" and even trying to take payment for another seat despite me letting them know in no uncertain terms that the payment I had made included all passengers who should have been on the booking. At every stage and almost everyone I had spoken to also reassured me that our party would all be seated together, I was therefore not surprised, when our confirmation emails arrived, that we were scattered over 6 rows of the cabin. More emails and phone calls to sort out, this was eventually achieved, however a couple of weeks later we received the "Service Change Notification" email which informed us that our seating allocation had been changed and we were again scattered about the cabin, with a 6yr old being allocated a single seat amongst strangers. Again more emails to sort. By this time we are almost dreading turning up at the airport not knowing what will happen next. In all it took me from 16th February until 28th June to get confirmation of the booking we had asked for. The booking saga was then followed up by some very mediocre flights. No menu choice left (and we were only in row 21) meal quality was poor. On return flight the crew didn't turn up to board the plane until take off time thus delaying our departure. When we asked for a drink for our 16month old (who had drunk his drink all up whilst waiting) we were offered water only which he doesn't drink, a request for fruit squash or juice was met with a "you will have to wait for the bar service to start and buy one". Cramped seating and cabin on return flight was dirty (seat back pocket was full of goodness knows what). Following our return home I complained about the whole booking saga and the flights. I eventually got a phone call from a young female at 4.45pm one day and got the distinct impression, from her tone, that she had been given the job of placating me. I was offered a voucher for a holiday for £200, and when I said it was unlikely I would be booking anything with Thomas Cook again, I was offered as a "good will gesture" £100 cash, when I asked how I was to divide this between 11 people all I got was "that is the most I am allowed to offer". Considering that Thomas Cook are the oldest and one of the biggest travel companies I was staggered at their lack of customer service and the poor quality of their offerings. I will not be travelling with them again and would caution anyone, who is considering it, to be aware that they can spoil your holiday before it starts.

### "never fly with them again"
For a 10 hour flight from Manchester to Los Angeles we were offered 4 films to watch - 2 of which were children's films and 2 were awful. There were some TV programmes to watch but only one episode from each programme - never Series 1, episode 1. So if you're happy to dive in at Series 7, episode 4 not having a clue what's going on and ruining it for later, that's fine. Despite paying £650 for our flight, you had to pay extra if you wanted more entertainment beyond this. The food was really poor, teeny portion and we weren't offered soft drinks or even water with dinner for the whole flight. Of course you were able to buy drinks for an extortionate amount. Other than that, we were pointed towards a jug of water right at the back of the plane (that tasted awful), that we were told we could help ourselves to. The service was laughable and I would never fly with them again. I've awarded 2 because the plane was fine.

### "Plenty of leg room"
Booked thru Condor Airlines Frankfurt to Miami with a change at Manchester. Frankfurt to Manchester was on Lufthansa and onward to Miami on Thomas Cook Airlines which was okay. Manchester is a terrible airport. The schlep from arrival gate to departure gate is in the international terminal with a very long walk and with several level changes. None of the moving walkways or escalators were working (we were told they had been out for months). We had to go thru security a second time. The layover was 4+ hours so we got breakfast. The food court is loud and confused. Prices are the highest I've seen in an airport. Boarding and departure were on time. This was a very new plane with entertainment screen in seat backs. Very different from the same model we flew BWI to FRA two weeks prior, with was old. Premium economy seats were OK in a 2-3-2 arrangement. I had the middle seat in the middle group; which at first I did not like. But it has much wider room under the seat ahead so you can spread out your feet and still have a bag under the seat ahead. Plenty of leg room (I'm 6'-2" with a 35" inseam). Attendants were great. Food was very good for an airline. Left on time but had to take a longer route because of weather so arrived just a few minutes late. Then found they had lost my bag. Four days later they told me bag had been put on same route "yesterday" but their agent had not contacted me (Thomas Cook and Condor do not operate their own counters, gates, or baggage claim; they use various agents). If cost is a major consideration, this is the airline for you. If avoiding hassles is important, look elsewhere but be prepared to spend more than twice as much.

### "in pure agony for nine hours"
Booked row 1 seats A/C (there is no B) on this A330. Going to Punta Cana from Manchester must have been an old plane, coming back we had a new one - beware they have added a storage area in the bulkhead in front. You have a pitch shorter than economy. All the new A330 planes are like this now. There is no 'bassinet' for babies as the bassinet would be on your chin. I suffer sciatica and was in pure agony for nine hours. Do not think row 1 is extra leg room - it isn't.

### "flight itself was fine"
Stansted to Orlando. The flight itself was fine, staff couldn't do enough for us. The only let down is the food, the flight out was passable, we had a choice of sausage and mash or chicken and macaroni, both were edible. On the flight home we had chicken, potatoes and carrots cut up into tiny chunks, just thrown in front of us. It wasn't very pleasant. Big mistake James Martin for putting your name to this mush.

### "choose to travel Thomas Cook again"
First experience of flying Thomas Cook from Gatwick to Corfu, and won't be the last! Great value for money, exceptional service by cabin crew, good in flight food, good selection of duty free and value for money goods. Would choose to travel Thomas Cook again without hesitation.

### "premium economy, stay clear of the front row"
Manchester to Holguin. We recently returned from our holiday to Cuba booked as a package deal with Thomas Cook. We had originally booked extra leg room seats in economy class at £60 each way (£240 total) but were informed that for an extra £20 each way we could upgrade to premium economy, more legroom and better entertainment etc. On our flight to Cuba we had no issues at all. I had selected the window seat right at the front of the plane and we got extra legroom with a brilliant flight. Premium economy really was worth the extra amount. On the return journey our planes layout had been changed and this meant the leg room at the very front row had been reduced for additional storage. We were not made aware that there would be reduced legroom when booking our seats. As there were no other seats available I had to sit in a cramped leg space even though I had paid to upgrade my seat. I complained to Thomas Cook on my return and they offered me £30 per seat as compensation even though we would have paid £60 per seat just for extra legroom in economy class. This is a real shame as although we didn't get the legroom we paid for the rest of the flight and holiday really was fantastic. My advise is if you book premium economy stay well clear of the front row.

### "fly them again on a short haul trip"
London Gatwick to Skiathos. I was very sceptical about booking a charter holiday and flying with Thomas Cook as I'd read so many bad reviews and haven't flown a charter in years. Departed Gatwick on time on what appeared to be a new A321, cabin and flight crew extremely friendly. Plenty of legroom (I'm 5'11" and not exactly thin) in 2A. Return flight was just as good, although due to the short runway in Skiathos and our take off weight, we had to land in Kavala for refuelling, meaning a 1 hour delay on the way back. Again crew were brilliant. I would definitely fly them again on a short haul trip.

### "shouldn't expect too much from flight"
Gatwick to Hurghada. If you go on a charter package, you really shouldn't expect too much from the flight to get there. Luckily I didn't, as this was a truly dismal 5 hour experience in each direction. Ancient aircraft, pitiful leg room (I'm 5ft 8 and was almost touching the seat in front) and woeful service (unless you want to buy something, of course) made it a poory start and end to an otherwise great holiday. Prebooked seats thankfully were confirmed, and they didn't recline which is for once a good thing given the total lack of space. The James Martin food was actually ok but those were about the only positives I can draw from it, apart from getting there in one piece. Other highlights included 1hr30 sitting in a queue at Gatwick to take off, with absolutely zero information from the flight deck; half width seat back tables which made dinner a real challenge for 2 small children; food literally lobbed at us by the crew, despite them seeing clearly that we had children to try and arrange so they could eat it; food 'boxes' taking up the majority of said half width tables; food not being cleared for an hour; I could go on, but it just brings horrible flashbacks. Sadly you probably won't have a choice if you book with Thos Cook, but if you do then take it. Even Ryanair is better than this 1980's throwback.

### "premium product worth the money"
Manchester to New York JFK with Thomas Cook Airlines. I would fly with TC again and I would recommend the premium product. The product is good value and the fast track security, decent seats and faster checkin are worth the money alone. The food is not good, maybe we were unlucky but this was standard airline food both ways, not good but edible if hungry. Drinks service is fine. Manchester is far nicer to fly from than Heathrow but then I guess that isn't rocket science.

### "amenities more than adequate"
Boston - Manchester is an under served route [AA stopped service some years ago] and Thomas Cook offers attractive, competitively priced service even with cabin upgrade [which I used on a R/T back in June]. Airline does not seem entirely sure of its identity as either a low cost medium haul or a true competitor to the legacy carriers. Fleet is modern and amenities more than adequate for a 6h leg but logistics let them down in many areas. For the Aug 5 O/B from Boston, gate check in time was 4.20 pm for a 5.20 ETD yet no gate activity until 5.35 pm and an eventual boarding time of 6.15 pm with wheels up closer to 7 pm. Communication from gate staff was nil causing mounting frustration. The F/O assigned blame to security delays at BOS, yet the absence of any announcements at gate [plus an 'on time' notice at the gate even at 6.35pm for a 5.20 pm departure suggests otherwise]. Flight 1h+ late into MAN and then no gate available [F/O again assigns blame to airport, yet gates are within the purview of airline]. After 45 in delay at a remote stand, a bus and eventually a gangway materialized, however many passengers missed connections as a result. Better communication is needed and the airline needs to train its staff in customer relations as opposed to blame culture. This is a good, economical option for BOS-MAN, but competition is looming [Virgin] and to keep this monopoly they need to step up a gear. Related to this, online check in was not available for either leg, necessitating a 1h wait for check in for boarding pass on return leg, which, combined with typically lengthy security screen at MAN [45min] requires at least a 3h buffer from departure time. The online check in has to rectified. Have traveled previously on same route in upgraded cabin which was good value, the logistic problems notwithstanding. Would recommend with caveats, and would not use if connecting flights involved as LHR or AMS offer many other options.

### "A330 can only be described as disgusting"
Stansted to Orlando with Thomas Cook using a HiFly A330 aircraft. What an absolute joke, if anyone is thinking of flying to the US with Thomas Cook be warned - they could put you on what can only be described the worst airline I have ever been on and trust me i've been on a few. The HiFly A330 can only be described as disgusting. Food all over the floor, seat back tables held up with sticky tape. Rude and arrogant crew who won't help you, as they don't work for Thomas Cook. Inflight entertainment a joke for a 9 hour flight if it works at all and people being moved as the seats where broken - this was before we had even took off. 2 toilets broken 2 hours into flight - trust me pay the extra and fly BA or Virgin Atlantic.

### "very confusing once problems occur"
At the time of booking, I was not aware (maybe I should have checked more thoroughly) that the first part of the trip was not done by Thomas Cook or Condor, but by the cheap airline Flybe. There were two hours in Manchester, which seemed enough to catch the connecting flight to Boston. Two weeks before the trip I received an e-mail that the first flight was changed. Instead of a direct trip to Manchester, Flybe made a stop-over in Rotterdam, arriving 1hr later in Manchester. I tried to call Condor, a lady told me that the first flight was operated by Flybe, and that this was not their problem. After calling several hotlines I found out that I had to call Flybe directly. They assured me that the airport of Manchester is very small, and transfer should not be a problem. Checking in in Düsseldorf was a disaster. The staff of Flybe were unfriendly. Even though the computer recognized the booking number, they did not manage to check me in. Moreover, I had a repeated ESTA, and they did not know that this kind of visa-waiver is valid, and refused to register me. I had to go to the travel office AHS at the airport (also very unfriendly) and finally to Thomas Cook, who informed me that I had to show a Flybe number to the Flybe staff (which did not appear on any of the Thomas Cook tickets). The whole process was extremely confusing and frustrating, made worse by the stressed and unfriendly staff of Flybe and AHS. To make a long story short, the Flybe flight was delayed due to the stopover in Rotterdam, I and three others missed the connecting flight to Boston, and were rebooked to an Air France flight. The whole trip was Düsseldorf-Rotterdam-Manchester-Paris-Boston. My suitcase got lost in the process. All in all, the connection between Thomas Cook, Condor and Flybe is very confusing once problems occur. When Flybe changed the first flight, it was obvious that there was a high risk of losing the connecting flight in Manchester. With this complicated structure, the unreliable airline Flybe involved I cannot recommend to buy a long-distance flight with Thomas Cook. For me: never again.

### "we were scattered around the aircraft"
Don't book until current IT system issues resolved. Lost reservations. Many passengers not receiving prepaid seats. 1 hour response time when calling them. Constant reassurance from helpdesk that all is now resolved when it isn't. Much stress and time at airport while they contact Thomas Cook, add all details manually, and then give you whatever seats remain on the aircraft. We were lucky - they had some spare seats, but we were scattered around the aircraft. Had to chase to get the seats refunded. Derisory offer of less than a fiver per person per flight as compensation for the time and stress, which I rejected. They now consider case closed.

### "seats were quite basic"
We flew economy as that is the only option from Glasgow. The flight out from Glasgow was actually all right but they charge you for everything. You paid to select your seats, get a drink, watch the entertainment. The trolleys were on the go the whole flight trying to flog you something or other. I found the seats were quite basic and became uncomfortable after a short while, the small of my back felt unsupported and they didn't issue cushions or blankets. There was a large gap between all the seats and you could see through to all the rows in front. There was plenty leg room for me at 5' 6" and there was something watchable on the free entertainment offered so we didn't pay for the premium service. The food on the way out quite tasty (James Martin), I had the chicken (a strange mix of macaroni, chicken and BBQ sauce) but they ran out in my row (row 17) and everyone behind me had to take the sausage or face paying for some overpriced food from the snack shop. I had ordered a gluten free meal for my son who has Coeliac Disease but there was no meal for him. The staff were very apologetic but this is not much use when you are stuck in the air for almost 9 hours. They offered him a green curry from the snack shop but it wasn't to his taste. I was assured that they had double checked that his meal request would definitely be on the flight home - but sadly it wasn't. I always pack food for him in case there is no meal for him (it's happened before) or is not to his liking, so he didn't go hungry. We were offered afternoon tea just before landing in Orlando. The flight home was with Hifly and I wasn't expecting much having read some poor reviews. The seats were meant to be narrower but it wasn't obvious, but they were much more comfortable than the flight out. They had proper headrests that you could bend in to support your head unlike the Air Tanker plane. The flight was so empty that we were able to have a row each to stretch out on and sleep. The full premium seat-back entertainment package was offered at no extra cost. The food was not pleasant - some sort of chicken dish (no choice) in a congealed sauce with some vegetables at the side, and my son's gluten free meal was missing, but he was offered any snacks he wanted (there weren't that many he could eat) from the snack shop at no cost. We were offered breakfast just before landing. The plane was definitely noisier than the Air Tanker but I was able to sleep the whole way home. Tips for flying Thomas Cook - If you want to avoid extra costs, bring your own snacks (or sandwiches) as they are very expensive on board. Make sure you leave any meat products on the plane though, you can't take them into the US. Bring your own headphones - both flights used a standard headphone connector. Buy a large bottle of water at the duty free shops to take on board - we also brought the Robinsons Squash'd concentrated juice to squirt into the water for flavour. They are only 60ml so you can take them through security. If you have electronic devices load them up with films or box sets of your choice to avoid paying for the films - especially for younger travellers. If you don't have high expectations, are on a budget and know what to expect then Thomas Cook Airlines are just fine.

### "very nice experience"
Manchester to Cayo Coco with Thomas Cook Airlines. Very nice experience on a new plane, lots space, nice and light plane. Cabin crew great and food is good. I was on a Virgin Atlantic flight a few months ago and was very disappointed and can't believe Thomas Cook is better.

### "absolutely superb experience"
Manchester to Las Vegas with Thomas Cook Airlines. Absolutely superb experience in their new Premium Economy cabin on flight MT166. Premium Economy highly recommended for the extra cost as it includes 30kgs luggage per person, 10kgs hand luggage, UK night before check in if you wish, fast track security lane, priority boarding, seat with 35 inch pitch and 19 inch width, free inflight drinks both alcoholic and non-alcoholic, premium James Martin meals on outbound flight, premium inflight movies, priority luggage delivery on arrival. The cabin crew on this flight were very professional, friendly and courteous at all times, well managed by the senior cabin crew person. We will definitely fly Thomas Cook Premium Economy again and recommend it to everyone. We are frequent travellers and have been privileged to fly with many other airlines like BA, Virgin etc in Club Class or Premium Economy and I can honestly say Thomas Cook offer a great value Premium Economy product which includes many benefits that BA and Virgin charge extra for.

### "service was very poor"
Flew on 23rd June from Las Palmas to Manchester. First told to go to Gate D32. Then told to go to gate D36 at the end of the airport where a Thomas Cook 767 arrived. We were then told to go to Gate C6 at the other end of the airport where we then boarded a bus and were taken to the 767 at gate D36. A shambles. The pilot said the flight would be 3 hours 40 minutes. The service was very poor. Serving drinks was so slow that they did not get round to serving meals until 2 hours 25 minutes into the flight. You had not got the foil cover off the meal and they were there offering tea and coffee. Before they cleared some of the meal waste they were doing the duty free run. The James Martin meal was very good, however the drop down trays on the 767 are so small you cannot get all the meal items and a drink on it and end up putting the cardboard box with cutlery etc on your lap.

### "disinterested staff"
Flew Kefalonia to Manchester. Pretty poor - disinterested staff, no flight information or information from the captain at all (it was Avian Express on behalf of Thomas Cook). Overpriced poor quality food, cramped seats and 3 hour delay. Cabin crew kept drawing a curtain across the front which blocked one of only two toilets on the plane. Then they announced that all the crew would be taking a twenty minute break 'as required by law' - I'm not sure why they all had to take a break at once. Wouldn't recommend Avian or Thomas Cook at all.

### "meals were good"
We had read some bad reviews about Thomas Cook Airlines but went ahead and booked flights from Glasgow to Orlando on the 1st June 2016. We checked in at Glasgow without any problems and the flight was on time. We had a good flight and the meals were good. The only complaint is that the inflight entertainment was not up to much, if you wanted to watch some decent films you had to pay extra. I have flown all over the world with various airlines and never had to pay for the films. The flight back to Glasgow was good but again the same films were on offer so I turned the screen off. The cabin crew were very pleasant and I will use Thomas cook again.

### "restored the pleasure in flying"
I have now flown twice with Thomas Cook on their JFK to Manchester route, and  they have restored the pleasure in flying. The seats are comfortable - they feel roomier, may be an illusion. The best thing is that the toilets are in a separate downstairs area, so no lines in the aisle. There were 5 toilets, so I never had to queue. In addition, the food is delicious! The staff are really friendly and helpful. On the downside - they don't yet fly this route in Jan or Feb, there are no free drinks, and the inflight entertainment is not great (although you can pay for an upgrade). I fly to the UK at least 3 times per year and I always book this airline when I can. I got a roundtrip in May 2015 for $700, and a roundtrip in August 2016 for $600. No complaints here.

### "crew were genuinely friendly"
Had some concerns after reading previous reviews about Thomas Cook Airlines but fortunately everything went smoothly. Horrendous queues at Glasgow Airport, even though we had checked in online there was about 500 people in the terminal and only one bag drop point. By the time we got through security it was time to board and we arrived 3 hours before. All our seats were correct as we had booked them online, plane was modern and clean. Crew were genuinely friendly. I think we pushed back around 15 mins late so not too bad. The James Martin meal was really tasty and we were offered tea, coffee, water or squash. I requested a decaf coffee and a lovely crew member went looking for me and managed to find some. The entertainment system was a bit of a let down if you didn't upgrade and pay the £4 you didn't really get anything, possible one movie and one TV show. Wouldn't have lasted 10 hours. There was an ok selection of movies. The TV shows were dire and again lots of programmes we'd never heard of. It was one of the worst systems I've seen software wise, nothing like some of the American carriers have. We were offered an ice cream cone and then afternoon tea before we landed which was a tasty scone, jam, clotted cream and two filled rolls. It was very pleasant and again tea coffee water or squash. Flight home again fine, clean enough plane, very nice crew who actually came round numerous times with free water. Meal on the way home was dire though, not James Martin branded. My beef was horrid dry strips of beef with no gravy or sauce. Our cold items were missing so had to ask the crew to swop the box they gave us. Hubbys chicken was much better than the beef. Quiet flight home and seemed to literally fly over which was good. Breakfast consisted of a cereal bar, orange juice and a yoghurt. Breakfast is always pretty naff on any international flight ive done. Seats were comfortable enough no worse than any other carriers. My only gripe was how much they push duty free, we had a good 10 min announcement about goods for sale. Also the same toilet broke on the outbound and inbound flights which meant we had to go to the back of the plane as it was closest to us that broke and they asked people not to cut into aisles and made you use another. I didn't like the layout of the plane myself and they were quite strict about which toilet you had to use and turned people around to use another.

### "thank-you for doing things right"
This is more of a thank-you to the Thomas Cook Crew who looked after us on a recent flight to Tenerife. The process from checking-in at Birmingham International, to boarding the plane was seamless. The plane was spacious, clean and seats were comfortable. What really made our journey so memorable however was the bright and breezy welcome and service from the onboard crew throughout the flights. We enjoyed a delicious meal and coupled with a couple of glasses of wine and a decent entertainment package, meant our holiday started (and ended) with a great experience. So, I wanted to say thank-you for doing things right.

### "very comfortable seat"
I booked this flight from Manchester to New York just a few days prior to departure and first time to travel with Thomas Cook for me. Very good price paid for a premium economy seat compared to other airlines, although I was slightly concerned when the online seat selector wouldn't allow me to choose my own seat. I needed me to call Condor customer service line, which I did. Once connected to the courteous service representative, I was assured I was booked in the premium cabin. When I arrived at Manchester airport on the morning of the flight, everything from check-in to arrival in New York was smooth and efficient. Seat 7D was assigned to me, and this is good choice for a solo business traveler. Very comfortable seat, plenty of leg room, and positioned near to the arrival jetway gate in New York so I was the first passenger to exit the aircraft. Excellent overall onboard staff service. I travel frequently around the world and enjoyed my first experience flying TC on this particular route. Would not hesitate to do it again in future.

### "was well worth the extra"
Manchester to Las Vegas. Fantastic flight and service with Thomas Cook. Travelled premium economy and had priority check in / boarding, fizz on departure, a decent selection of entertainment and tastiest inflight meal I've had. The seats were comfy and my hubby even managed a couple of hours sleep on the return journey which never happens! The crew were fabulous. I travelled to Vegas with Thomas Cook a few years ago and wasn't looking forward to the flight to be honest, but thought I'd give the new premium economy cabin a go - glad we did. Premium economy was well worth the extra. We booked seats 7A &7C, best seats on the plane.

### "crew was very friendly and attentive"
Not sure what people want from Thomas Cook Airlines / Condor Airlines. However, my wife and I got great value for our money. We needed to fly one-way from Great Britain to Orlando, and Thomas Cook was almost half as expensive as virtually every other airline. Reading the online reviews, we were ready for a less than satisfactory experience, but figured the cheap price would make up for it. Because we paid so little for our tickets, I purchased the "priority package" for 15 pounds each, which made checking in and getting through security very easy, and got us on board early so we could put our baggage in the overhead compartment. Definitely worth it. I also purchased seats 9A and 9C (exit row), but for some reason Thomas Cook didn't charge me. Still got the seats. My wife is short, so seat 9A was fine for her and gave her enough leg room, as well as a window. 9C gave me as much leg room as one could ever ask for. The crew was very friendly and attentive. I watched as they greeted every passenger and handed every child a bag with (I assume) some toy. The flight took off on time, and landed early. Can't ask for more than that. The in-flight entertainment system was great. I didn't pay to watch anything as I had my tablet, but the USB power adapter from the system kept me running the entire flight as I binge-watched show after show. I love to keep the flight map up to see where we fly over. Food was pretty good, especially for what I was expecting. They fed us three times - a lunch early in the flight, a mini ice cream cone around mid flight, and a scone / cheese snack around 90 minutes before the end of the flight. We did have to pay for drinks, including water and tea, which is a bit annoying. However, for our seat price it was fine. They did give free coffee a couple of times, but I'm not a coffee drinker. The seat was not very comfortable, but I got up every couple of hours and moved around. By being in seats 9A and 9C near the exit, we got off the plane quickly and made it through customs very quickly. We accidentally left one piece of carry-on luggage aboard, and one of the crew brought it out to us just as we realized we left it. All in all, we were very pleased with Thomas Cook airlines.

### "most uncomfortable flight"
Manchester to Orlando with Thomas Cook Airlines and the most uncomfortable long haul flight. Seats flimsy but hard. Not suitable for long flights. Inflight meals average. Cabin crew not to the standard of other airlines used previously. Other than during the inclusive meal drinks are charged for. Other airlines go the extra mile to ensure you are hydrated throughout with water, juice and will bring it to your seat - Thomas Cook expect you to fetch it if they can be bothered to serve you. Head phones and inflight entertainment charged. All about the money. Will stick to my first choice of Virgin or one of the American Airlines when returning to the USA.

### "sat on the tarmac for 5 hours"
Glasgow to Tenerife South with Thomas Cook Airlines. We were diverted to Fuerteventura on the outbound flight, due to a backlog at Tenerife airport. Sat on the tarmac for 5 hours before continuing on to Tenerife. During this time all we were offered were small cups of luke warm water, and this was only after asking for refreshments. By the time we reached our hotel the dining room was closed. This obviously spoiled our 1st night. Any claim for compensation was refused. Would say I am not going to fly them again, unfortunately had booked to fly to Turkey with them this week.

### "absolute disgrace"
Absolute disgrace. We have had a flight change to 6am and we are travelling down from Scotland to Manchester for our onward flight to Dalaman. It is nigh on impossible and will spoil our holiday. We paid in Jan for good flight times. We have asked if they can change us to the cheaper Friday flight as it is better flight times. They will only change if we pay £175 per family extra. It's a disgrace when the Friday flights are £24 cheaper than what we paid for our Saturday flights. There are 12 in our party so that would be a saving to them but they say they have to add the going out and coming home flight together and we have to pay the difference. Fine but we are still coming home on the same flight so why should we pay the extra money that it has gone up by? I have sent an email to complaints department. 3 weeks later I have still not heard. This company are certainly are not for their customers. Will never fly with Thomas Cook Airlines again.

### "cheap until extras were added"
Gatwick to Tenerife South return with Thomas Cook Airlines. Decent and fairly new plane. Innadequate legroom on outbound flight but mysteriously couple of extra inches on return flight. The seat spacing seems inconsistent. Booked in-flight meal for £10 which was okay but small and only included a small cup of tea, still had to purchase more drink which annoyed me. Had to pay extra for and hold baggage which I think should be old-hat now. Flight appeared cheap until all the extras were added. Feel Thomas Cook are trying to sell things to passengers at every twist and turn.

### "Seating is spacious"
Just flew from Manchester to New York with Thomas Cook and very impressed with the premium offering. Seating is spacious and comfortable, and crew were attentive and pleasant. The IFE was good considering the price paid, and the food served was more satisfactory than I had imagined. All in all, yes there are certain elements that could certainly be upscaled, but for the price paid I believe Thomas Cook have a fantastic offering on this route.

### "not recommend to anyone"
Larnaca to Gatwick with Thomas Cook Airlines. I tried checking in online the day before and I got an error message saying that there was a technical problem and I cannot not check in. I attempted again the morning after and I could check in, but it would not allow me to to select a seat so I decided to check in at the airport. I went to the airport and there was three normal desks from Thomas Cook and two "fast track" desks where you needed to pay 10 euro. The normal desks had at least an hour queue, which I was indirectly forced to take since I arrived two hours before my flight, and it was unclear whether I would make it on time. This was very sneaky. Not giving the option the night before for people to check in due to "a technical error" and then making people pay because there was that many people at the airport check in. After waiting for almost half an hour at the fast track check in, I asked for an aisle seat. The lady at the desk told me that it was unlikely she would be able to book me an aisle seat because the flight was so busy. I told her that I am not willing to pay the fast track fee until I get an aisle seat, since it was the reason I did not check online the morning before, and why I had to pay it. After that, magically an aisle seat appear to be available. That  was only the start of an unpleasant journey. There was an initial delay because they made a mistake regarding the terminals. After that there was a second delay because they booked seats for a family apart and by law children under 16 should be supervised. So they announced that unless people volunteer to move seats the plane would not take off. Some people paid for those seats! And if a family has to be sat together why did the booking system not arrange that when they were booking ticket. After finding people to move, they announced that there might be an hour delay, because a storm was catching up on us due to the previous delays. Thankfully the plane took off. During the flight the plane was ok. I brought my own headphones to use (since there was a tv) but the port on the plane was a rare one, and they made you pay to get a pair of headphones that was compatible. Overall, Thomas Cook might seem cheap but it is a sneaky and money-hungry company that will force you into paying other stuff. Also the company lacks any concern for its customer. I would not recommend them to anyone.

### "I am disappointed"
Thomas Cook Airlines flights operated by Condor Airlines. Just returned from Cancun to Gatwick on an overnight flight. The flight out, 10 days ago, apart from enduring a long flight, all went well, although cabin kept pretty cool. Inflight entertainment was not great, I do expect a little more choice and newer films - although those were available should you wish to upgrade! On this return flight, the cabin was really cold. Vapour was pouring out of the AC, showing how cold it was, even with a blanket! Within a few hours my throat was sore, felt really dry and congested and I now have a nice aircraft cold! Reading about this it seems that if low humidity is kept for too long, our defenses (in nose and throat) suffer and we get a cold, or certainly cold like symptoms where our system is so irritated. Never had this before and if I wasn't put off by long haul already, this has sealed it. The return flight had no different inflight entertainment, so didn't bother. Near the back of the plane the middle 4 seats become 3 and so we had 4 seats a bit skew in front of us. This meant the screen is skewed too and during a night flight, as you can see between seats, their screen brightness affects you. When the meal came, the pretty officious crew lady said we had "opted out" of the meal - really? This is long haul and your website states quite clearly: "In Economy Class on longhaul flights (Zones 3-5), we serve a hot meal, and depending on the time of day, an additional cold meal or cold breakfast prior to landing (a light snack on flights up to 8 hours). All non-alcoholic beverages are available free of charge. She made us feel like we were begging for a meal and "as there were some left over", she allowed us to have one! The offer of water during the flight, remember when they came round with trays of water to encourage re-hydration, didn't happen. So, I am disappointed as the outbound flight was not so bad. My star rating doesn't reflect how I feel regarding the health aspect / AC comfort.

### "staff were friendly and helpful"
We flew as part of a package holiday from Manchester to Palma with Thomas Cook Airlines. The flight was early morning going out and around noon coming home. Both flights were on time. Boarding was quick and easy. This was a short flight, less than 3 hours, and we found the seats and legroom comfortable enough for this length of time. We did not order any food, nor did we buy any food or drinks as we had no requirements. The staff were friendly and helpful. It was smooth flights and felt it was good value for money.

### "I would travel Thomas Cook again"
Return trip from Manchester to New York as a family of 4. Chose Thomas Cook as it was half the price of Virgin. We had to pay £4 each to upgrade the inflight entertainment and we maybe spent £20 on drinks during the flight but when you save £2000 on the flights that's nothing. Flights were great, lots of legroom and plenty of good food. Cabin crew were friendly. Flew back premium economy as it was much cheaper on return leg. Was easier to sleep but didn't really take advantage of the free drinks/films as it was night time so not sure if it was worth the extra. All in all, I would travel Thomas Cook again.

### "had to pay for inflight entertainment"
A family of 4 flew Thomas Cook from Orlando to Manchester. The flight started well - about a 40 minute delay then only 1 toilet working, no running water to wash your hands then told that there was no tea or coffee on board, they blamed the catering company. There was only water but we could buy a Starbucks off them (£2.80) on an 8 hour flight, then we had to pay for inflight entertainment £4 x 4 each way, was not told this at time of booking and no kids food available either. We were told that it was our fault as we had not told them our 9 year old was a child.

### "delayed by 5 hours"
Flight booking that I first made from Antalya to Gatwick with Thomas Cook was cancelled and rescheduled from 3pm to 9pm. Thomas Cook refused to refund/amend my booking. On the day of the journey, 9PM flight was delayed by around 5 hours, so we left Antalya at 1.15am and reached Gatwick at 3.10am. If I had known at the time of booking that I would be flying at 9pm or 1AM, I would've never made my booking on that flight. Thomas Cook arranged dinner for all passengers at Antalya Airport through VIA World Buffet. Name sounds great but it was a take away service, served from outside the main restaurant area, with 'cold' chicken wraps, 'cold' burger and veg pizzas. Flight Attendants did their best to cheer passengers but passengers found it difficult to cheer being tired at those hours.

### "been misselling the seats"
London Gatwick to Orlando with Thomas Cook Airlines. Pre booked seats had been triple booked so they had been misselling the seats. We spoke to the lady who was in our allocated seats, and she had booked them 3 months after we had booked and paid for the seats. The return seats were very poor even though they was extra leg room 31H/K next to the exit door, however due to them being near the toilets there is a horrid smell for most of the flight. As this was a overnight flight the light is on all the time and the door will not shut on the toilet after use, so you have permanent light so not able to sleep - a simple curtain between would prevent this.

### "they deserve a better airline"
Thomas Cook Airlines from London Gatwick to Cancun. Our flight was meant to leave at 8-30am but we were told at check in this was cancelled and all were now on the 10-30 flight. 2 aeroplanes worth of passengers, and we still had our assigned seats? They said they had tried to contact everyone (from others we found this to be erroneous and our travel agent told us they had her and our telephone numbers and did not call). We were given a free drink onboard to make up for the inconvenience. Overall seats were comfortable, entertainment option (basic or £4 extra) were poor. The airline did not seem to know whether it was charter so they were intent selling drinks and snacks, not long before handing out gratis lunch (James Martin grub was very good ). The return night flight was similarly a selling exercise which took away from dimming lights so passengers might sleep. The cup cake breakfast was not worthy of what true long haul carriers offer. The cabin crew ok - they deserve a better airline.

### "very good service all round"
Manchester to Arrecife with Thomas Cook Airlines. A very good service all round. We'd checked in online, and astonishingly there was no queue, while standard check in queue was maybe 30 minutes at least. A new plane outbound was very clean, with polite and efficient cabin crew. Took a picnic, so a coffee was fine for a four hour flight. Similar inbound, no complaints. Both flights punctual to the minute.

### "compounded by a lack of action"
Manchester to Bridgetown, Barbados. With aprox 350 others on a Thomas Cook Charter flight to join Mv Adonia on a 14 day cruise. Check in time no later than 6.30am for flight at 9.35am. My wife and I check in at 5.50am. The vast number of passengers were pensioners (I am 76) and a number were disabled in some way. We were boarded prior to 9am but remained on gate 26 as we were awaiting a De icing crew.The Pilot then said we were being moved to a holding area to await de icing. We then sat on the plane being promised a possible departure in the next 15 Mins after being deiced as we were getting near the top of the queue. We sat and waited and waited but all we got was the promise that we would be on our was soon. The crew said we could not be served any hot drinks or food on the ground due to regulations. We were given 2 small cups of cold water. One wing only was deiced and the truck drove away never to return. The captain said they had run out of de icing fluid. A short time later we were given another cup of water two small sandwiches and a scone. Ours was just about defrosted. We were then told that the crew was out of hours and we would be bused back to the main terminal. We were amongst the last and got the just before 3pm. We were then given a £20 voucher each to get a meal and to listen to the tannoy for further information. The food outlets were busy and we had just got our meal when a tannoy message for passengers to go to go to departure gate 26. Whilst on way to gate 26 staff from Thomas Cook gave conflicting instructions to go to other gates which meant going up and down steep steps to cross from one number gate etc. We then got to the gate 22 when we were told that we would not be flying that day, to go through immigation collect our hold luggage, walk across the airport to the Bus station and board transport to go to and hotel. (Remember the age of the vast majority of passengers). No assistance was available from Thomas Cook and none at the hotel in the midle of Manchester. The staff at the budget hotel there worked their socks off, 350 guests dropped on them. They had even cooked a three course meal for us. The only fault was that there was only one working lift. AS most of us were put on floors 4 and above this problems, but the staff did all they Could (dont forget our ages). After repeated requests by him the manager found that we were to be picked up at 4.30am. Again there was no presence at the Hotel by Thomas Cook and the confusion of the previous evening was again present compounded by the fact that the fleet of buses had to park in and around the Hotel. Passengers to walk around to find the transport dragging their cases behind them. Yes we did get to the airport and we did fly out. The ship was still there and we did go on the cruise. A slight snow fall, compounded by a lack of action was the main cause. Did the airport have action plans, did Thomas Cook have action plans is it not common for planes to be delayed. The icing on the cake was on arrival at the ship a Flight officer, insructed us to claim on our own travel insurance. The flight was from the UK by a UK airline Does not the EU regulations apply here. Does the delay start from the 3 hour check in time, not the time the plane should have flown. I think it does.

### "came around just twice with drinks"
Manchester to Goa with Thomas Cook Airlines. The staff weren't very friendly. On a 10 hour flight they came around just twice with drinks. My husband went up to buy some (we've never paid for drinks on an airline before), and the staff said she was coming round in a minute. We waited an hour, then I went up and she said we are coming now. We then waited another half an hour before they came. Plus paying for the movies was not good.

### "staff were grumpy and unhappy"
Gatwick to Geneva with Thomas Cook Airlines, I was not expecting much but got a lot less than that. We got to the airport 2.5 hours early, only to stand in a queue for 1.5 hours with two young children at 6am in the morning. They had not even opened 50% of the check in desks available to them. The staff were grumpy and unhappy. The flight iteself was delayed on both legs of the journey by over an hour each time and the staff on the plane cared more about selling duty free than tending to the requirements of passengers. On the return leg we were in a queue to check in for over an hour. Such poor planning but I would suggest it was about cost cutting than a customer experience. I=

### "poor service throughout flight"
Booking in at Punta Cana was a nightmare, no staff to direct to pay outbound taxes, we queued up Thomas Cook desk for half hour to be told we needed to join another queue, 30 of us. Got to check in desk and the seats I booked and paid for I am told I can't have. I asked why and told "already gone" -  I said I paid £120 extra for seats, and was advised to "see cabin crew". They changed the airplane, there was no premium class, all extra leg room seats had been given to those customers. Staff were rude to passengers, no apologies, poor service throughout flight. Customers service after 7 days still not been in touch, awaiting for reply to email.

### "like a no frills airline"
Manchester to Goa return with Thomas Cook Airlines. We booked our holiday 4 months in advance and tried to book premium seats as my husband is 6.3 feet tall but unfortunately all seats were booked. We then chose our seats on the plane and paid an extra £80 to do this, we knew which seats would allow my husband extra legroom as we had booked these seats before on a flight to NYC last year. On arrival at check in we were told our return flights had changed and we would be travelling the night before rather than in the early hours of the next day, we had received no prior notification from Thomas Cook. We were allocated different seats than those we had pre-booked on our outbound flight from the UK, luckily my husband spotted this as soon as we left check in and returned immediately. Check in staff couldn't allocate us our seats on the system and had to get a Supervisor to override the system which delayed our check in. On our return journey the check in procedure at Goa airport was awful. Only passengers with flight tickets are allowed to enter the airport and reps had to stay outside, there were therefore no representatives from Thomas Cook at the check in desks to deal with any problems (of which there appeared to be a number for passengers who had paid for additional luggage and those travelling with medical equipment etc). We were told that our pre booked seats were not available (no reason given) and were allocated tickets in the front of the plane, not even close to where we had originally booked our seats. On entering the plane it turned out someone else had been given our seats! Why pay extra for pre-allocated seats when there is no guarantee you will actually get these. I also object on a 10 hour flight at being forced to pay and extra £4 for additional movies. Thomas Cook is trying to squeeze every last penny out of you and is operating like a no frills airline which is isn't meant to be.

### "excellent value for money"
First time long haul with Thomas Cook from Manchester to Cancun. Service and food good. Crew friendly and professional. Seating was comfortable with enough leg room. Seat back entertainment with a good choice of films and music. Ok some films are a little old. Premium offers separate check in, priority boarding and priority luggage delivery which worked well at both airports. Have flown Virgin Atlantic Premium Economy and only real difference was slightly better seats. Overall can't complain at all, we got excellent value for money and would definitely fly with them again.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
Goa to London Gatwick - flight time and pick up time amended (brought forward by 4h35m) without any notification. Was extremely fortunate to be in the hotel when the taxi arrived but caused complete mayhem to get ready (shower and change of clothing in room we payed £53 extra for was a complete waste of money) and only by the taxi drivers capability were we able to get to the airport in time. As far as the aircraft (A330) was concerned I found the seating rather uncomfortable and inadequate for a long haul flight.

### "never fly Thomas Cook again"
Our return tickets from Goa to Manchester were booked and paid for in September 2015. We were up at 01.30 hours on 2nd February to make it to the airport and had paid for a taxi. We had our seat numbers on our flight itinerary so naturally assumed all would be well but after queuing for X-ray of our luggage and then again for check in, we were so wrong! This was after all Thomas Cook! We were informed by the check in staff that our names were not on the flight list, despite having numbered seats and therefore we could not board the flight home. After lengthy discussions and protestations, we had to stay overnight in an airport hotel (and literally fight to get fed and watered )and return the next evening . We had booked and paid for a return from Goa to Manchester. We ended up with a flight from Goa to Mumbai with Air India, then Mumbai to London Heathrow via Jet Air and then LHR to Manchester with BA. With lots of queuing at each stage of our departures and no time for food drink or duty free. At each airport we had to claim our baggage from arrivals then re-check it in at departures and pay an additional excess baggage surcharge because Tomas Cook had not informed ground staff we had paid for extra luggage. We were told not to worry as we could claim it all back but this is scant comfort when your debit card is becoming hot from all the additional transactions and everything we had been told was turned out to be untrue. It was an absolute and utter unedifying experience and I will never fly with Thomas Cook again. Incidentally, they are well known repeat offenders of overbooking - the ground staff told us that another seven passengers would be bumped off the return flight on Thursday 3rd Feb but they had no way of knowing who until the flight names were available so could not inform the unsuspecting passengers until they arrived at the airport.

### "Thomas Cook at Manchester sucks"
Our Thomas Cook Airlines flight was due out of Manchester at 11:10 so I thought checking in around 3 hours before would give us plenty of time to have some breakfast and relax before our flight. How wrong was I, arrived at the Thomas Cook checks in area at 8:00 and my horror at the length of the queue of passengers waiting to check in for various Thomas Cook flights. On further examination noticed that of the 15 or so check in desks available to Thomas Cooks only 2 of them were in use. It took us an hour and a half to get checked in, then a further half an hour going through security so by the time we got through to the departure gates it was time for boarding. So no breakfast! I am sure that the airport will not be too happy as they are losing out on business with passengers not having time to browse the shops or purchase any food. The flight itself was on a Condor aircraft (German arm of the Thomas Cook group) and found it very good. The return flight experience was great in comparison, speedy check in at Fuerteventura with plenty of time to relax, enjoy some food and drink prior to the flight, much more pleasant. So Thomas Cook at Manchester airport sucks and needs to get it sorted, I for one will carefully consider alternative airlines before booking my next flight and choose one of those over Thomas Cooks where possible.

### "seats hard and uncomfortable"
Flew in extra leg room seats on a Thomas Cook Airlines A321 from Manchester to Tenerife return. Cabin crew surly and dismissive. On return route one of the staff chewed gum and bad mouthed previous passengers. Flight out was very good, in flight meal was excellent, passengers ignored captains seat belt sign - captain even made an announcement that his message and seat belt sign was for the benefit of the passengers. Return flight delayed as incoming flight was diverted to Gran Canria, owing to winds, caused a 2 hour delay, again meal was excellent. Inflight drinks and coffee very expensive, and seats although nice, are hard and uncomfortable, for a flight exceeding 2 hours.

### "very cramped and uncomfortable"
Flew Thomas Cook Airlines from Manchester to Cancun. New cabin but very cramped and uncomfortable, crew unfriendly. Food was greasy and bland. They are trying to compete with scheduled long range airlines and it's just nothing like it, I'd rather fly with Delta or American next time to Cancun. I'm sure the the LA service due to start soon will be awful, all that way on a charter plane.

### "operated by Condor"
Flew Manchester to Fuerteventura with Thomas Cook, the flight operated by Condor - pleasant German crew were very efficient. On time. The return flight again operated by Condor with the same excellent service, landing 31 minutes early. The only thing I feel I must mention is on the outbound flight under Condors code drinks were cheaper to purchase and coffee and tea was free, the return flight again with Condor but under the TCX code drinks and tea and coffee were all a lot dearer. I asked the crew why and was told that they had to charge these prices as a Thomas Cook flight - confusing to say the least. Having flown on a Thomas Cook Airlines A321 last year, Condor was streets ahead for service and comfort!

### "would not fly us back home"
Having travelled from East Midlands to Tenerife the flight was very pleasant. However due to my partner having had her ankle fractured on holiday, this airline would not fly us back home to the UK. A certificate was given by the Doctors at the Hospital saying that my partner was able and Medically fit to fly on an aircraft back home. This flight back was on a Sunday. The Thomas Cook Airlines rep said that they did not have a Doctor at the Airport to give authorisation for her to travel on the aircraft. We had to wait until Monday morning. Having contacted our travel insurance on this matter they booked us back to the UK by Ryanair. No Problem for Ryanair so long as we carried the certificate issued by the Hospital. Why I ask was the problem. Not a word from Thomas Cook Airlines.

### "seat in front was so close"
We had a 5 hour flight so loaded my laptop with some films to watch as I knew they had no entertainment on this flight. When we boarded I couldn't believe how crowded it felt, so many people crammed into such a small area, our seats were on row 19 and the seat in front was so close, I could hardly open my laptop! Thomas Cook have supplied me with a customer survey to complete, this will be more fun than the flight - don't they understand that people would pay more for comfort and entertainment?

### "pleasant helpful staff"
Thomas Cook Airlines flight from Manchester to Barbados via Antigua. Overall good service and excellent value for money. New plane. Pleasant helpful staff. Good legroom but difficult to get comfortable for sleeping. Food on outward journey fine but not quite as good on return and breakfast rather strange. One criticism on outward journey a group of people was allowed to stand up talking for some considerable time right next to us in the gangway which made us feel uncomfortable and they should have been asked to remain seated by staff. Pilot conducted the plane very smoothly. We weren't treated like economy class customers as with the popular short haul airlines.

### "worst food I have had"
Computer meltdown at Gatwick check-in which is not uncommon looking at other reviews hour and a half wait. Later Thomas Cook blamed it on an aircraft problem. Flew from Gatwick to Barbados, seats as comfortable as a park bench. Airplane boiling hot. The worst food I have had on an airplane ran out on the flight out and back so had to give up my meal twice to keep the kids happy - not good on a 9 hr plus flight. A certain famous chef that puts his name to this should take note. I then asked if they could sell me some food and they said yes we have loads. I suggested they carried less to sell me and carry enough to serve me what I would like. This was not received well by the miserable cabin crew who were sloppy, cheaply dressed and not professional at all. You have to pay for everything including the poor quality children's films. The only flight I have ever been on that I did not watch anything from their inflight selection. I would rather pay a bit more.

### "moved us on to the very early morning flight"
Booked Thomas Cook Airlines flights via website a few weeks ago and several flight times were available at different prices. We paid over £300 more to fly at decent times from Stansted to Tenerife as we were travelling with kids. A week later we get an email to say they have moved us on to the very early morning flight. So essentially we have paid £300 more than we needed to. It’s a nightmare trying to get through to anyone in customer service - finally got through after an hours wait today and they are totally not interested. They just say ‘it’s in the terms and conditions that we can change the flight times’. They haven’t changed the flight times - they have moved us on to a totally different flight that was available at the time of booking. So be warned - it could make no difference which flight you choose as they can move you on to what ever flight they like with no refund of the extra cost. We will never book with Thomas Cook again and would strongly recommend others think twice too.

### "fiasco trying to upgrade"
Manchester to Goa return with Thomas Cook Airlines. The fiasco of trying to upgrade from economy to premium economy was a disgrace! We were unable to book online, as the computer system is not working, still. We paid for our upgrade seats on the outward flight but had to check in to be given our seats. This meant we had to make sure we arrived early at the check in. Same again coming home, we booked a taxi (Thomas Cook main office in Panjim) recommended this to guarantee our seats. We arrived at Goa airport at 9.00pm for the 2.15am flight. The flights themselves were ok. but I will think twice before booking with Thomas Cook again.

### "bad customer service"
London Gatwick to Hurghada return with Thomas Cook Airlines. They are almost unbelievable how bad their customer service was. How can an airline behind such a large company suffer such a total disgrace of a system failure running over 2 months at least? Unable to do any online actions such as booking extra luggage or seats. Tried phoning to find waits in excess of 60 minutes and gave up. Total chaos at LGW check in with massive queues as yet again the system was down or had failed. Eventually check in agents gave up trying to arrange extra luggage or extra leg rooms seats and in fairness just allocated it all for free. But left us with a nightmare possibility on the return as no one could tell what the local staff would do with horror stories of people being charged hundreds of pounds for excess luggage which should only have been £35. After numerous calls and e-mails whilst away finally managed to get things resolved for the correct price. On the plus side flights ran on time.

### "not fly Thomas Cook again"
Manchester to Cancun return with Thomas Cook Airlines. We were delayed 2hr 50mins (they made sure it wasn't over 3 hours because then we could have claimed compensation). Also delayed over an hour on return. You have to pay to watch films/tv. Pay for drinks which is unacceptable on an 11 hour flight. Blankets and pillows aren't available on day flights even though the cabin was freezing - we had a night flight on our return so blankets were available, but we didn't need them as this time the cabin was ridiculously hot! Service was terrible, just sell, sell, sell. Cabin staff were rude, and seats uncomfortable with no leg room. Staff were sleeping on the spare seats during their breaks. We will not fly Thomas Cook again, no matter how cheap they are.

### "cheap seats and service "
I wish I had looked at this closer. When I originally looked at this Manchester to Antigua flight it was not an AirTanker A330, so I missed the switch. Never again will I trust Thomas Cook Airlines. The flight was so bad I came home with a different airline preferring to lose my money on the return flight. It's true you get what you pay for - cheapish price (depending on travel dates) but very cheap seats and service - added to the breakdown of the website for 2 months prior to travel so that any information etc was limited, to being able to get through on the phone. Think twice ! !! !

### "not worth the money"
Cancun to Glasgow. On booking my flight I was led to believe that I would be on one of the upgraded aircraft with new seats. Unfortunately this was not the case. Old uncomfortable seats with no legroom on a 10 hour flight. Food trays were dirty, some toilets were closed, so only 4 toilets available, usual food, breakfast in particular was poor, aircraft was hot. Just really uncomfortable and certainly not worth the money. Seems Thomas Cook flights are getting worse.

### "seats are uncomfortable"
Antalya to Gatwick with Thomas Cook Airlines. The seats are uncomfortable, absolutely no room, during the safety brief we wondered how you get into a brace position - the seat in front is too close. Thomas Cook are interested in selling as much as they can on every flight, customers are not their priority. We have always said never again, but they are the only airline that fly the route direct in January. We did fly with Turkish Airlines via Istanbul on our outward journey and what a difference, no baggage fees, no golf club fees, comfortable leather seats with plenty of room, nice food and drinks without charges, no loud cabin crew trying to sell as much as they can. This flight was £200 cheaper! It's a disgrace how they can cram as many people on a flight as they do!

### "a pleasurable experience"
We had never flown on a charter before or on Thomas Cook Airlines. We booked Premium Economy from Manchester to Barbados return. Flights in both directions were on or ahead of time on a refurbished A330. Leg room in Premium Economy was more than adequate and the inflight entertainment good - I managed to watch the complete series of ten episodes of Fargo - five out and five back! The seat is rather like the old BA Premium Economy and sleep is possible. Food was a little disappointing - only curry was loaded on the way out due to some mix up over Xmas meals or so we were told. Service was polite and friendly and drinks were topped up without fuss. All the crew dealing with Premium Economy were cheerful, chatty and full of life - not the image presented in some other reviews. All in all a pleasurable experience.

### "flight was wonderful"
New York to Manchester with Thomas Cook Airlines and I thought the flight was wonderful. The staff were pleasant and I loved the priority boarding program at Manchester, a really good idea. I originally wanted to travel premium but that was full on my flight. The plane and bathrooms were clean and the food from Manchester to US was good. My only negative was the food from US to Manchester which was not edible - it was awful. I will be flying Thomas Cook Airlines again soon, just hope I can get premium seat!

### "staff friendly and efficient"
Saint Lucia to Manchester via Barbados on Thomas Cook Airlines. Paid extra for exit row and it was worth it for the night flight. Drink service soon after take off which you have to pay for. Also purchased the premium film and tv package which at £4.00 is worth it if you are not able to sleep. Food was very tasty. The chicken meal includes dessert, cheese and biscuit and a chocolate was very tasty. The staff were friendly and very efficient. Arrival into cold and wet Manchester on Christmas morning. Luggage seemed to take ages to arrive. Immigration was very fast with no queues. A great alternative to flying via London. Wish they would offer the flight year round and not just for the winter.

### "indifferent, stressed and understaffed"
London Gatwick to Holguin with Thomas Cook Airlines, a budget airline. Would travel with them again for short haul but never again long haul. The seats were small, did not recline and the leg room inadequate which made sleeping difficult. On the flight to Holguin there were inadequate blankets and I was told that they do not stock them on certain flights. On the flight back to London we were seated in a row of three seats, the row in front was four seats so the TV screens did not align and made it difficult for the middle person to use the TV. The entertainment system was ok, although if you wanted more than a few movies and films you had to pay £4, which I have not encountered on a long haul flight before. The film selection, paid or otherwise, was poor, as the movies were old. The food was very bad even for airline food and drinks were only provided free of charge when mains were served, twice in 9 hours! Snacks and drinks other than the coffee, tea and water provided at meal times had to be purchased which I have never encountered on a long haul flight before. My friend is lactose intolerant so requested a vegan meal at booking, on both flights they forgot to pack the meal and the staff instead of being apologetic said 'what do you want me to do about it? The cabin crew seemed to be indifferent, stressed and understaffed, aside from meal times they were very rarely seen.

### "outstanding for budget airline"
We flew on a 4 month old Thomas Cook Airlines A321 from Paphos to East Midlands. The aircraft was outstanding for a budget airline, comfy seats, fresh interior and great in flight service. We booked front row seats which were excellent, they offered extra leg room for a small price. We left Paphos 20 minutes early due to passengers being onboard early. Cabin crew were nice and friendly. The inflight meals we preordered were tasty and shortly afterwards a film began on the overhead entertainment screens. The aircraft had a new livery which looked nice. Our outbound journey was just as nice, but on an older A321, this flight offered similar service, meals and entertainment. I would recommend them.

### "found it very unprofessional"
We flew with Thomas Cook Airlines from London to Cancun. The flight crew were trying to be friendly, but mainly focusing on sale. We were on our honeymoon and did not care much. We ordered a bottle of champagne and some snacks, in total I think we spent around £100. I was surprised that they were charging for headsets and extra movies, but when I overheard that there was a tap water available on the plane and the crew was only offering and charging for bottled water, I found it very unprofessional. Seats are uncomfortable

### "everyone was complaining"
Antigua to Manchester via Barbados. Set off late from Antigua as the count had to be done 3 times, then got to Barbados and teenagers had been drinking vodka and were swearing and being abusive to cabin crew so had to wait on the plane for at least half an hour for police. This wasn't Thomas Cook's fault but we were told to take all our bags and duty free off the plane and go and wait in a transit lounge, so took all bags off the plane. Then had to queue for a hour to go through security search, bags back on the conveyer belt to scan again, body search, belts off, and duty free taken off us. Items written down, we said we have just had all this done in Antigua and got on a plane and got off, why all this again - they said we agree but it's Thomas Cook rules not ours. The next thing they are rushing us on as the plane wanted to take off. Waited to get duty free back, then back to boarding. 1.5 hour later no lounge to sit in, just queuing and being searched again was a joke. Never going to get a flight that stops off again. Everyone was complaining, children crying.

### "still a low cost concept"
Manchester to New York JFK return. We had seen a recent article about the Premium service so we thought we would give it a try. While queuing for check in Thomas Cook will try and sell you some sort of premium check in service for £20 per person - I thought when I purchased my tickets to fly Thomas Cook I had paid for a premium service already? The outbound flight was operated by Air Tanker services on behalf of Thomas Cook. Aircraft wise it wasn't bad at all, it was clean, it was a 1 class layout and was pretty smart and the advertised leg room was definitely the case. You could also tell this was a pretty recent cabin refit. But impressions would soon change quickly. Inflight entertainment - £4 to upgrade if you wanted in Flight Entertainment, otherwise you were left with basically nothing. Ok its only £4, but Thomas Cook had already tried to sell me something in the terminal and now they're trying to sell me an improved inflight entertainment package (I thought this was a premium service? ), £3 for headsets. Inflight meal - who on earth designed this? A giant box with a piece of bread with some crackers and cheese in, and your cutlery, followed by a tiny hot tray of hot food which then barely left any space to put anything on your tray table? Honestly what a stupid way of doing things. Also I think its pretty appalling that you don't get a drink with your inflight meal, apart from the complimentary thimble of tea or coffee you get afterwards. The whole flight just felt like the cabin crew were just constantly trying to sell you things. The return flight was operated by a 2 class layout Thomas Cook A330-200 which caused problems with some passengers who had pre-booked seats. The front section was 'Premium' which clearly offered bigger seats with more leg room (again, I thought we had paid for a premium service?). Some passengers weere complaining, and rightly so. The excuse from the Cabin crew was there had been a last minute aircraft change. This was nonsense, on the outbound flight operated by Air Tanker we had heard the crew saying the aircraft was going to be repositioned and would mean we would end up with a different aircraft on the return leg. The flight was uncomfortable and noticeably was not as good as the A330 which is operated by Air Tanker. On a whole I'm just totally confused on what product Thomas Cook are trying to offer with this. What the hell is premium about it? Its still a low cost concept just with the illusion of half giving you a poorly executed 'premium' service. Would I fly with Thomas cook again? Why would I? I will stick with paying a bit extra and flying with proper airlines.

### "friendly and efficient"
Second time traveling with Thomas Cook from Manchester to Barbados return. Cannot fault outbound or return flight. Premium Economy was worth the extra, cabin crew were friendly and efficient. I would not hesitate to recommend.

### "Cabin crew friendly and helpful"
Flight left on time and arrived at BGI 25 mins early. Aircraft (G-OMYT) newly refurbished interior. Seats comfortable and plenty of leg room on the 2-3-2 configuration. Cabin crew friendly and helpful. Food quite good but portions could be larger. Inflight entertainment good. Inflight bar expensive-but who cares when on holiday. Return flight equally as good-left spot on time and into MAN 25 mins early. Would recommend Thomas Cook Airlines on this route as somewhat cheaper than VS.

### "Thomas Cook was the worst"
Flying out the plane was delayed for an hour, no explanation was given. Onboard the staff seem to be interested in is selling as much as they can. They are very slow at bringing the drinks trolley around, it was at least an hour before we were offered anything. The meals were poor quality, we had a choice of chicken or beef, I had the chicken which was awful and the portions were child size. James Martin needs to think again! The service was awful with meals more or less thrown at us. IFE was poor, not much to choose from unless you upgraded for £4 and even then the films were old. The tv programmes seemed to be episodes picked at random. The return flight was even worse - we were again delayed by an hour and a half the excuse being the flight was delayed coming in. We had extra leg room and sat in row 9, first row in the cabin. My husband had condensation dripping on him for the first five minutes. The steward said this always happens. The staff were scruffy and one of them kept addressing everyone as "love" - not very professional at all. We have flown long haul many times with various airlines, Thomas Cook was the worst.

### "floor and trays were filthy"
Manchester to Rhodes with Thomas Cook Airlines. I travelled with my partner and we paid the extra deal to get a meal, extra weight for luggage and to pick the seats. The seat we picked on the screen was a window seat but on the plane it was a blank wall. The food tray barely fits onto the seat tray and you can't fit a drink on too. There were TV screens every so often down the plane ceiling however we had a screen directly above our head so couldn't see that and the next was too far away and too many heads in the way even if we could see it. The floor and trays were filthy. The plus side was the flight was on time and cabin crew were nice.

### "It was ok not great"
I did not have particularly high expectations of a Thomas Cook Airlines charter flight. It was ok not great. The legroom was not great but bearable for a short 4 hour flight but anything longer would have been quite traumatic. I pre ordered a meal which was so bad. Tiny portion consisting of half a rasher of bacon, something which I think was a tomato and some highly processed powdered scrambled egg. The tiny sausage was ok. The accompanying packaged items were loaded with sugar. Credit must be given to the flight attendants who remained polite and efficient through out. It's very clear there's a huge emphasis on selling. This I expected but the constant PAs were infuriating. They were made every 5 minutes and were very long which constantly interrupted any rest. In all not an awful experience but not great. I got there safely and that's what counts.

### "customer service is shocking"
Thomas Cook Airlines had overbooked our flight so we had to wait until everyone was on the plane to see if we could get on - luckily we got on but although paying reserved seating and picking our seats, me and my friend were separated to opposite sides of the plane. When landing in Corfu we soon realised they left my luggage in Manchester for 3 days - delivered it to the wrong hotel which me and my friend had to then travel to collect ourselves. The flight back was also delayed by 45 minutes. We had to use our spending money to rebuy essentials, and after waiting 6 weeks for a response from Thomas Cook Airlines, they basically tell me sorry but we're offering you £50 worth of vouchers off my next Thomas Cook holiday. Don't fly with them, they ruined a 10 day holiday and caused me so much stress, and their customer service is shocking!

### "use this airline again"
Seats allocated together for family of four despite not paying extra for this. Economy seating is adequate with reclining option (although did not work this out until return journey - lever to right hand side under seat). Individual seat back screens with option to upgrade to more choice of TV for £4. James Martin food on way out which was really nice. Acceptable food on return. Blankets and pillows provided. Excellent cabin crew. Have flown with Virgin before and this was on par, if not better. Would definitely use this airline again.

### "cabin crew were helpful"
I flew with Thomas Cook Airlines to Palma de Mallorca from Exeter, in August 2015. The cabin was clean and cabin crew were helpful. We were delayed for 50 minutes at Exeter because of the bad weather in Mallorca at the time. We departed 50 minutes later and had a pleasant, smooth flight. On the flight back, about an hour into the flight someone had a heart attack or stroke onboard, luckily one of the passengers was a doctor so he attended to the passenger. Because of that the pilot sped up and the flight took 1 hour, 40 minutes. The landing back at Exeter was the most bumpy landing I had ever had. But at least the ill passenger got into a ambulance and to hospital safely.

### "they were excellent"
I flew Thomas Cook Airlines from Manchester to Orlando return reluctantly after reading many bad reviews, and they were excellent, the crew could not have been kinder or more attentive. The seats were very comfortable with reasonable leg room, people must remember they are half the price of Virgin! Thank you Thomas Cook.

### "happily travel again"
We flew with Thomas Cook Airlines to Cancun on the refurb aircraft in economy. Having researched the product prior to travelling I knew what to expect ie £4 for extra movies, no recline in economy etc. I have to say, Thomas Cook are pretty good for long haul. People can't expect first class service and comfort for an economy fare. The outbound aircraft was clean and crew were very helpful and friendly. Decent food for a flight. Inbound aircraft could have been a bit cleaner. Again great crew and no issues. You have to pay for drinks, extra movies more legroom but for the price what you receive is very good. I would happily travel long haul with Thomas Cook Airlines again.

### "expect no frills flights"
The last time we flew with Thomas Cook was to Las Vegas in 2009 and we said never again, however when Manchester to Miami was a new route we wanted to return to Miami so we booked expecting more from the new updated aircraft - we were so wrong. My husband and I fly long haul twice a year using Virgin or Thomson depending on where we go. This Thomas Cook flight was the worst we have ever had since the last Thomas Cook flight. The seat didn't recline which I don't think is a bad thing but it was so upright there was no comfort in it, the seat base was so short back to front it made my legs numb because it was pressing on the back of my thighs. There were only 5 films and some were foreign and so old, I did pay an extra £4 going out but on return exactly same movies so no point. The food was appalling, how James Martin can be proud I don't know. The offering going out on a 9hr flight was chicken curry or sausage. Unlike Thomson economy and premium and Virgin economy and premium nothing was free. The water was given in tiny cups with the meals and don't ask for squash more than once. They must be the only airline whose staff don't move when the seat belt sign is on, we had our food on the trays for 1hr with no drinks service while the seatbelt sign was on then they didn't collect it, just offered coffee tea or water with weakened squash. Thomas Cook don't even offer online check in, you need check in at the airport which in turn forces you to pay £20 each person each way £80 to ensure you have seats together. I could go on but I have to stop somewhere. Expect no frills flights and you may be ok, however jet2 have them beat in everyway.

### "staff were generally helpful"
Having flown with several airlines long-haul, Thomas Cook were definitely the worst. The staff on the ground and in the air were generally helpful. This review mainly concerns the return flight from Cancun to London Gatwick. This flight was delayed by over 24 hours due to a fault that was only detected once all 300+ passengers had been boarded. We were told there was a slight problem and that we would be leaving shortly. 4 hours later after very little information we were told to disembark, go back through customs and immigration, and were sent to hotels for the evening. The speed at which hotels and transport were organised for all passengers was impressive however and the hotel itself wasn't bad. The next day after much waiting and frustration about the possibility of missing another day of work, we were told that Thomas Cook were flying out an engineer and a part from the UK to fix the issue. (Why the part couldn't be obtained on the North American continent is baffling) We would fly later that evening. In flight entertainment was rather good, especially the music selection and usb charging ports. A family member of mine lost a tiny piece of paper which was obtained on arrival and apparently is a legal document, without which you cannot leave Mexico. Fair enough but TC failed to mention that in order to avoid paying £25 per person you will need to hold on to a small scrap of paper for 2 weeks. We were sent back and forth from booth to booth, he had to fill out a new form, then queue up in a long line of other angry people caught out by this outright scam. The other serious gripe with the flights, both outgoing and return was the food. As a vegan I was correctly given vegan meals, including a nice curry (for breakfast!) and these were served first before other passengers, which is always nice! After receiving a rather meagre first meal we were then left for another 8 hours before a second meal was served that consisted (for me) of unseeded grapes and an apple, and for everyone else, a bottle of water, yoghurt and a cake. During the 4 hour wait before we were sent off to hotels, we were given nothing but tiny cups of water, which were considered refreshments by Thomas Cook. Other long haul flight operators have kept me well fed with snacks throughout the flight eg. nuts, pretzels, soft drinks. All TC offered occasionally was tea or coffee and a tiny ice-cream. As a vegan, the quality of the main meal on the return flight was ok, however there was nowhere near enough and I was mistakenly given several items I could not eat such as dairy butter and sauce containing egg. Overall a poor flight experience, however everything else such as the hotel and holiday itself was great.

### "great cabin crew "
Thomas Cook Airlines from Manchester to Orlando return. Excellent service with great cabin crew who were entertaining and happy to please. Great food on outbound flight to Orlando but it's never as good on the why back. Seats were great with lots of room. Premium entertainment was okay but not excellent. Only one toilet in premium got busy just before landing, so best to go at least 30 minutes before landing time. On landing you would expect premium to be exited first (which kind of happened) but economy did rush foward and push though and this needs to be address.

### "offered one drink the whole flight"
We booked to go to Las Vegas to in October 2015. At the time, it stated we would be on the new Thomas Cook A330. We found out that we get two meals, refreshments, 36 movies to choose from, a choice of tv shows/ music and the usual Duty Free. We board the Airbus A330 and it is stunning for a certain length of time. We get settled, looked at what movies to watch on the way, only to find out there are 5 available, 3 were foreign. You actually have to pay to access movies which is £4 to upgrade per person, this includes music and tv programs (completely mis-sold). There aren't any new films either, so don't get your hopes up. No blankets were offered, no pillows or headphones unless you asked. The blankets ran out. The food eventually came round, a choice of chicken or beef both with vegetables - get neither. Refreshments throughout the flight, you actually had to pay for them too. £2.50 for a bottle of orange the size of hand. If you want a can of pop, coffee on the side, water, alcohol you had to pay for it. I was offered one drink the whole flight, cabin crews attitude when you even ask them for a drink or even anything was appalling. On our way home, on a completely different plane, one of the old ones. We actually had pillows and blankets on our seats this time. Throughout the plane was bits of rubbish, maybe from the previous flight. We asked for some alcohol on offer in the Duty Free magazine - none left or we had to choose something else. Again, refreshments you had to pay for (I took my own on this time), same food as previous, awful, and only tea and coffee came round.

### "trying to sell priority check in"
My review is not so much with the flight, but check in at Glasgow. My wife and I arrived at Glasgow Airport for our 7am flight at the advised check in time of 5am. Our flight number and destination (Fuerteventura) were clearly displayed on three check in desks with the usual long meandering queues associated with Thomas Cook. As we tried to join the queue, we were approached by two staff trying to sell priority check in which we declined. We were then told not to join the queue, but to take a seat away from the queues until we were called. We sat for about 25 minutes, until my wife decided to find out what was happening. On her return she said we were still to await calling. By this time I had had enough and tried to find out what was happening and ask why we could not join the Fuerteventura queues. We were told our flight was delayed until 9.40, and we should have been told by e-mail. I said that we had never been notified and why had we been sitting for now 40 minutes and not be allowed to join the check in queues. I then asked to see a Supervisor, she duly arrived and tried to explain to us that the flight to Cancun had been delayed until 9.40. I said that's fine but we are not going to Cancun - how many times do we have to tell you, we are going to Fuerteventura and the gates now close in ten minutes and we will not get through that queue in that time. Panic then set in and numerous apologies were given to us. We were then quickly ushered up to the check in desk. Perhaps assisting passengers instead of trying to get more money out of them would help.

### "nothing short of scandalous"
Anyone thinking of booking with Thomas Cook Airlines beware. Pre-booked the holiday in September 2014 for myself and two children (ages 12 and 15 respectively), I was shocked to find that we were all allocated separate seats. My son sat in the row in front of me and my daughter (who suffers from travel sickness) was allocated a seat in a different section of the plane. The whole 11 hour flight experience was ruined with me having to continually get out of my seat (inconveniencing fellow passengers) to check on her welfare. The aircraft was full with other families so there was no way for the crew to swap our seats. It was my assumption that families would, at the very least, be seated together not in different sections of the aircraft. Having travelled frequently with other airlines, this has always been their standard policy. I asked a fellow passenger how he was able to secure seats for his family of five, I was horrified to hear they were charged an additional £20pp (each way) to be seated together - an additional £200! Having already paid close to £4000 for a holiday, I was not made aware when booking, that passengers were charged extra money to sit together? This is nothing short of scandalous. In Mexico, I queried this charge with the Rep and was told the only way to guarantee seats together was to pay this additional £20 "penalty". Since my daughter is not a good traveller, I was forced to pay an additional £60. The inflight entertainment left a lot to be desired - very poor/limited choice an charging £4 to watch premium movies (which were not premium as all were at least 8 months old), is daylight robbery. Since my children were not seated together, we could not converse, so I was forced to fork out an additional £8 so they could entertain themselves on a 11 hour long haul flight. Refreshments had to be paid for. The flight experience felt like a budget airline but with a premium airfare price. It felt like the entire flight was spent seeing how much money the flight crew could fleece from passengers. The return flight was just as bad. I could go on, but there's not enough space and I'd probably grow a beard. I wrote letter of complaint to Thomas Cook and they replied 2 months later more or less saying, "sorry, but that's just how we roll!". The reply was as unsatisfactory as their service.

### "great value for money"
Recently flown a return flight in Premium Economy from MAN-LAS, I was very surprised with how great this product is for a charter airline. I have done countless flight with THomas Cook over the years, if you haven't been long haul with them since the refurbished cabins you will see a big improvement. Could pre-book my seats free of charge straight after booking. We had priority check-in at Manchester airport, along with fast track airport security both worked really well and within 20 mins we were in the departure lounge, also you get on the plane first. New seats on the plane are really comfy and lots of room, I'm over 6 feet tall and had no problems at all. Great IFE, has about 30 movies and lots of other TV programs and music, screen is about the size of an iPad, plus you can charge your own iPad or phones etc via USB port. Welcome drinks options before take off champagne or orange juice, with pretzels as the snack. The drinks on the flight are free, same as any flight I've done with every airline there is only a few trolley services but you can just ask for more drinks at any point, lots to pick from, beers, wine, spirits, cider, cocktails, soft drink and you could have prosecco. James Martin inflight meal was lovely, same as economy but you get a bigger meal, later on you got a pot of ice cream to have watching a movie. The pre-landing meal with 2 rolls, Victoria sponge cake and clotted cream jam scone. On landing in Vegas our luggage with off first, the priority luggage tags put on for premium economy customer worked very well both going and coming home. The return flight was just as great, lots of free drinks and the in flight meal was still good even though it's not James Martin, had priority check in, boarding and luggage included still. Just to put my review in context, this year I also travelled with British Airways premium economy and Thomas Cook are offering a much better experience. The cost for Premium with BA is a lot more and I didn't get to pre book more seats free of charge, no priority check in or luggage, seats are very old with very dated in flight entertainment with only a choice of about 10 films. I would recommend a Thomas Cook Premium Economy flight, great value for money.

### "crew were very helpful"
We flew with Thomas Cook to New York in July. We booked seats 13H/K both ways, flight left on time arrived early, the entertainment is great, 30 movies to watch. Can't understand why people moan about the IFE when there are so many films to watch. The crew were very helpful, service great, as commented by quite a few Americans who were flying to Manchester, they said you wouldn't get as much with American Airlines as with Thomas cook. The food is good, good selection of drinks and snacky things.

### "good legroom and footrests"
We were very pleased with our flight with Thomas Cook Airlines. Almost no waiting at Premium Economy check-in. Newly refurbished aircraft. On time. Good legroom and footrests. Friendly, efficient onboard service. Decent airline meals.

### "seats given to someone else"
My husband and I booked our holiday with Thomas Cook, we also booked our extra leg room seats together at the same time and paid extra for this. When we checked in we were given our boarding tickets the lady at check in just said you have extra leg room seats. We then went to have breakfast and at that point I said to my husband I would check seats were correct - they were wrong. My seat had moved half way up the plane while my husband's was correct so we went to check in and complained to be told our seats had been given to someone else. After complaining again we were moved again a bit closer together but still opposite sides of the plane. This for me was a nightmare as I am a nervous flyer, hence we book and pay extra for seats together. Once on the flight it became apparent our seats were given to some golfers who wanted to sit together. We have complained to Thomas Cook Airlines but as yet they have not replied to my email.

### "were the worst flights"
Me and my girlfiend are frequent travelers but can honestly say these Thomas Cook Airlines flights were the worst flights we have experienced. The staff were abrupt and unhelpfull and looked like they couldn't be bothered with customers, most of the drinks on the menu had sold out before they had got half way down the plane, the entertainment was terrible even if you paid the extra £4 and was exactly the same on the return flight! On the return flight we got sat 15 rows apart, even though we had booked months before and people who were on standby got seats next to each other. We asked one of the check in staff why this was, and were basically told it wasn't her problem. By the time you have paid for all the extras and drinks you may as well fly with Virgin or BA as the service alone is a 1000 times better then Thomas Cook.

### "not what I expect from an airline"
I recently flew with Thomas Cook to Hurghada on 11th September and back on 26th September. My husband had his knees up against the seat in front all the way there and back. I didn't think it was possible to have such a small tray to put your meal and drinks on. As it happens it is not possible to put both your meal and drinks on it at the same time. Having said that our flight out was not too unpleasant as the meals were hot and the cabin staff were very pleasant and helpful. One of the many issues I had was there was no film inflight as is advertised on the website. The flight back was a completely different story. After what can only be described as a scrum to get on the plane we all got seated and were immediately reaching for our jackets. The plane will warm up I kept telling myself. As the flight went on I had to ask for a blanket and received the curt reply - We don't do blankets on mid haul flights. I have flown mid haul flights before and have always been given a blanket and pillow as they were also night flights. My husbands meal arrived and it was cold. We had pre-ordered the meals. I am afraid to say that the cabin staff on the flight home were more interested in the conversation they were having between themselves than they were in their customers who pay their wages. I also noticed that their shoes were needing a very good clean, something I find very telling in people. I was not the only one to mention the heating on the flight and most people sat with their jackets on all the way home. I will not be flying Thomas Cook in the future as the standards are not what I expect from an airline.

### "terrible and nothing has changed"
Did not have a choice flying Thomas Cook as it was a group booking - would not recommend. We have flown with them previous and it was terrible - and nothing has changed. Group booking of 16, all pre booked - when we received our boarding cards - our group were scattered all over the plane, with one sitting by themselves! Check in staff were rude and unhelpful. The plane should have been used for a short haul flight (maybe an hour? ), not a 4.5 hr flight. No leg room, and I mean no leg room! No TV's, plane was dirty and very old. Apparently the plane was changed at the last minute - but I’m pretty sure the seating could not have been messed up that much. One of our parties seats was broken. I have to say a couple of the staff on board were very nice, however other members made it very clear that they would rather be somewhere else. The air con was dripping from the ceiling of the plane and soaking some of the passengers, including some of our party. The staff on the flight back were very good, and quite friendly and chatty. However plane was grubby, the magazines etc in the pocket of my husband’s seat were sticky - I dread to think what it was. We didn't have any meals so cannot comment on food, however with the service we received from Thomas Cook in Turkey (non-existent!) and the fact that nothing seems to have improved with Thomas Cook, I will not be recommending them - would be fine if they were a budget airline, but they are not.

### "we enjoyed the experience"
Flew Thomas Cook Airlines from New York JFK  to Manchester and back again, we had seats 11H/K, for both trips. Both my wife and I enjoyed the experience from check in to arrival. Food (two meals) was good and plenty. The inflight entertainment was good. Watch two free movies, and the GPS a lot. The only extra we paid for was for assigned seating. Would travel again with Thomas Cook Airlines.

### "overall an okay experience"
MAN-MCO return Premium cabin. Check in at MAN was chaotic. Multiple lines for different passengers. Economy, Premium, Priority and multiple other lanes all with a lot of people queuing. Best advice arrive earlier rather than later. Fast Track Security was neither fast track or fast for that matter. Still had to stand in line with everyone else. Multiple low cost airlines fly out of the same terminal so be prepared to wait in line with hen parties, stag groups etc. Boarding, the gate area at MAN is very old and run down and is one of the longest walks from check in. Families and people requiring assistance are called first to board followed by premium them economy by row number. After boarding welcome drink of either champagne or orange is served for premium passengers. Inflight entertainment is touch screen with premium channels already loaded. Economy passengers can top up for £4 per passenger. I would advise to do this as normal entertainment is rather poor offering. No games offered. Meals were average at best. Arrival procedure was again chaotic as crew let economy passengers off before premium. Priority baggage stickers mean nothing and baggage handlers make no attempt to segregate. You end up no better off waiting with everyone else. (Return leg our bags were last off) Flights both left late both ways however Thomas Cook seem to allow huge allowances for taxi / takeoff and landing so both flights eventually arrived on time. 2 x 23kg for hold baggage is industry standard for premium economy. Hand baggage is weight monitored however as long as you do not over do it they seem to be relaxed about it. Premium seats are roomy and allow for a better experience than economy. Crew were very chatty and not at all professional both ways. In comparison to Virgin or BA they were very casual. Overall an okay experience that could have been improved if all little extras were actually implemented.

### "cabin crew very friendly"
Flew Thomas Cook Airlines from Manchester to Miami return in economy. Both flights left pretty much on time. Plenty of space in seats, entertainment selection very good. Cabin crew very friendly and chatty and worked hard. Meals were excellent, probably the best airline food I have tasted.

### "shocking service"
Paid premium economy on these Thomas Cook Airlines flights, and airport experience up to boarding was very good. Once boarded, the welcome drink did not arrive till 30 minutes after getting airborne. Cabin staff seemed to hide behind the curtain and talk very loudly about their social life. Drinks and meals were served at what seemed the appropriate time but don't try and get any service outside the planned service. I had a sore throat and rang he call bell to ask for water, my wife overheard one steward tell another to switch the call bell off and they didn't respond. After 15 minutes or so I went forward to ask for a drink and was told " you must be a mind reader I am just coming round with the trolley". 40 minutes later the trolley appeared. Shocking service, should have learned from my previous Thomas Cook Airlines experience. I believe its their business strategy to give the bare minimum of service because they can't compete with Thomson otherwise. Travelled same route last year with Thomson on Boeing 787, as much as you want to eat and drink all the way and staff were genuinely keen to make sure you enjoyed your flight. Only used Thomas Cook Airlines this time because of dates but never, never again.

### "crew onboard were friendly"
The crew onboard were friendly, actually smiled and were attentive. The outbound flight from Glasgow to Tenerife I was seated next to the doors. Initially I was pleased of the additional leg room but midway through I was frozen with the draft from the doors. I was offered a blanket but a hot water bottle would have been more appropriate. The only time that I saw a Thomas Cook rep was when I was on the transfer coach going to my hotel and this was only the back of his head. It was at this point he said that he couldn't come with us as he had to wait on the last flight leaving. The next time I saw a representative was on route to the airport at the end of my holiday. He was curt, rude and condescending to other people waiting on their transfer who were flying via Thomas Cook Airlines. He didn't take the time to explain to an elderly couple that they were not on this transfer shuttle. Check in staff at Tenerife were also a disappointment - very little conversation. I appreciate it was late at night and they may have had a long day but manners and a smile cost nothing!

### "Thomas Cook Airlines do not care"
This was one of the worst flights we have taken as a family. The Thomas Cook Airlines plane advertised on the booking was a newly refurbished plane offering state of the art entertainment system with latest blockbuster films, ergonomically design seats etc so that we could arrive refreshed and relaxed. The reality was the opposite. The plane was old and dirty, the entertainment system non-existent (total of 4 films, at least two years old, 2 in French, lasting a combined 7 hours), the seats very uncomfortable with no leg room and the service was very slow and poor. It was also 3 hours late as there were technical issues. They even sold us some headsets for the flight but did not tell us the entertainment system was not as advertised. The return flight was identical (but on time), except it had not been cleaned properly and also had the same four films! We were advised of a replacement plane one month before departure but assured the experience would be the same. They were still advertising the newly refurbished plane for our flight after we got this advice but before the flight - and still are now so beware. I contacted Thomas Cook customer services by email who passed me off and said no compensation was due after considering it for 5 weeks. I then spoke to customer services who also passed me off and said no compensation is due. Thomas Cook Airlines do not care. I will never fly with them again!

### "both ways the flight was satisfactory"
Stansted to Palma return with Thomas Cook Airlines. Outbound seats 4A/B, and on the return seats 4E/F. Both ways the flight was satisfactory. I must say the outbound cabin staff were a lot more proactive and people friendly. Food was not ordered so I cannot comment. Flight deck reports were good. Would have liked the flight map to be used more through the flight. Seating was adequate for a short flight of just over two hours.

### "never travel Thomas Cook Airlines again"
Manchester to Lanzarote with Thomas Cook, and when booking in 3 passengers, we were not booked in together. One family - 1in one aisle, one in second aisle and one in third aisle. Seats too close together and no room. Food wasn't experienced but looked terrible - passenger next to me complained it was bland and not worth the value charged! Same complaint as return flight from Accerife to Manchester. Food terrible, seats too close and booked in different places, although one family of three. Thomas Cook Airlines are doing this to encourage passengers to pre=book seats in order to make more money. Will never travel with Thomas Cook Airlines again if we can help it.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
Great airline and probably the best I've been on. The food for purchase onboard was delicious and a bargain for the price. There was a lot of legroom and the cabin staff were top class. Thomas Cook Airlines will be my preferred airline in future trips.

### "inflight meal the worst I've had"
Flew Glasgow to Mahon with Thomas Cook Airlines. Flight was okay but aircraft was dirty, cabin staff scruffy but pleasant enough. The inflight meal the worst I've had, consisted of 1 small sausage 1 cherry tomato and a teaspoon of scrambled egg - very poor.

### "food was surprisingly good"
This was a good holiday flight from Glasgow to Larnaca on Thomas Cook Airways, left on time and had no crying babies. We were on a Boeing 757 VISIT EGYPT livery. Seats were comfortable, staff were nice, and lots of food and drinks service. No IFE, but holiday airlines don't usually. Food was surprisingly good and came with a bread roll, crackers, cheese butter, milk, a dessert and a main. good flight.

### " on time, friendly staff"
Newcastle to Corfu with Thomas Cook Airlines. Flight left on time, friendly staff. Seats and leg room weren't too bad but there was a bit of rubbish stuffed into the base of my seat which hadn't been cleaned. Announcements a bit quiet but informative. Nice that they had overhead maps on the screens and played a few short tv episodes cartoons etc. Meals were tasty on both outbound and inbound flights. Only negative was how long it took to get our meal nearly 2 hours into the flight. They wanted to do snacks and drinks rounds first, obviously to try and make money, and they specifically told people it would be a while before meals were served. I felt this was on purpose to make you buy snacks and drinks.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
After a technical fault with the scheduled plane we were allocated a new plane. It is important to say that I am a very nervous flyer and this change made me feel uneasy. We were allocated a Thomas Cook A330, and wow what a plane! We were allocated seats next to each other and all passengers were given access to the premium movies free of charge. The plane was so comfortable and I really don't want to fly on any other aircraft from now on. I am an incredibly nervous flyer and what I would say is the captain was fantastic, on both flights the captain came over the speaker to explain our route and as we were coming to land explained that what we would be able to see out of the window.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
Due to catch the 12.55. Delayed until 15.30.Eventually asked to go to gate at 15.05. This info went up at the same time as board stated gate had closed! Down to gate 91 where it was announced there was a further delay, left just after 5pm. Arrived after dark,approached Thomas Cook rep to show them our transfer for 7 people - three generations of our family. The rep told us that although we had booked flight and hotel through them, and bought and collected our transfer through them, it was nothing to do with them! Explaining how late we were and in a new place, the reply was that they had been kept waiting too. Eventually looking at the document once more he was able to point us 50m away to the correct area, finishing with 'it's all there in black and white'. Thank you Thomas Cook.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
We flew to Orlando on a replacement plane hired from Hi Fly. The plane was old, a bit grubby and there were only 4 films (2 of which were in French?) but the crew were nice and the new James Martin food was the best airline food I've had. We were looking forward to the new plane back only to find it was the same plane with same films. Worst of all they had seated our 2 girls (11 and 14) next to the escape exit on row 26 while my husband and I were seated in row 25, the other side of the toilets. How on earth could TC have made such a mistake. We had paid extra to ensure we sat together. When re-arranging the seating surely TC should have had a plan of the plane in front of them? Hi Fly were great. Once everyone was on board they moved TC crew from the back of the plane and gave us their seats. TC did not approach us at anytime to help despite there being several crew on board. I've never flown TC before and won't again. The entertainment system didn't work. We got given a free drink though to make up for it.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
We booked our holiday in March and we chose Thomas Cook as it was a new route they were starting from Stansted to Cancun and it was meant to be on a brand new plane they were leasing - this is what they promised us and sold to us. 2 days before we flew out the plane had changed to HiFly aircraft (Portuguese budget airline) and the seat configuration had changed to 3x3x3. We had paid for and pre-booked our seats and didn't get what we had paid for. On the outbound flight the plane was filthy the seats were broken, the screen was broken and not working. Only 4 films for a 10 hour flight two of which were in French. The staff did their best and one of the stewardesses remarked don't worry coming back its going to be the new aircraft. How wrong she was - our rep in the resort let us know that the plane was still going to be the HiFly on the way back. A Thomas Cook rep gave us a letter on our coach back to the airport to say that the plane was going to be Hifly again. Again the plane was filthy, seats broken etc. We had exactly the same seats as going out and would you believe it the same screen was still broken 2 weeks later. We were told they only had the drinks left onboard from the outbound journey as nothing gets replaced or topped up. They ran out of hot meals, not that they were anything to shout about about anyway. They had no ice for drinks. Again it was the same 4 films two in French however this time the staff overrode the IFE system and put their own DVD films on. This was ok however it meant you couldn't turn the screen off. I will never ever book with Thomas Cook again. I appreciate things happen and changes are sometimes inevitable however when you are selling people a holiday with a whole new aircraft the price I paid for my flight / holiday included this new plane not a Portuguese budget airline aircraft.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
Our Thomas Cook flight was replaced with HiFly airlines. We had paid to reserve our seats and had done so based on the scheduled Thomas Cook aircraft configuration. Luckily we checked a few days ahead only to find the aircraft had replaced and the seating configuration would be different so we had time to change our seating arrangements otherwise we would have been separated based on the different layout. Eventually Thomas Cook did email us about the outward flight but as we discovered on checking in for our return flight that this had also been changed but we had no notification. Luckily we checked in early and could also rearrange our seating to be together but this caught a lot of people out on the flight. Seeing as you pay to choose where you sit Thomas Cook should have notified passengers for both legs of the journey and much earlier than they did. The flight itself was fine, the Portugese staff were nice but the way they did the meal service was very slow, bringing the kids and special meals by hand through the cabin before the other meals came along on the trolley. I think there could have been a better way of doing this. Also we had some Thomas Cook crew on board which made the flight a little odd with some announcements by them and some by the HiFly crew. Basically the HiFly crew did all the work of serving meals and clearing away and the Thomas Cook crew did the duty free as they were on commission. Rather strange, one crew only please.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
Reading some of these reviews is like reliving our terrible experience with Thomas Cook. We booked with Thomas Cook but they changed the aircraft. We had to fly with Hi Fly. Our prebooked seats, which we paid extra for, were changed and the plane was filthy. There were biscuit crumbs in the pocket in front of us, peanuts on the floor and chewing gum stuck to the seat. My head rest came off in my hand and my nieces arm rest was broken. The flight both to and from Orlando was horrendous. Cabin crew couldn't understand us and were rude. There were broken seat back TV's and the entertainment was a joke, there were four films, two were French and a couple of TV episodes.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
We flew to Las Vegas using Thomas Cook who advertised brand new spacious planes with entertainment including 35 movies. Instead we were informed that our plane had been replaced with a 'hi-fly' aircraft. The seats had broken plastic all over and were taped up in an attempt to fix them. There were 4 movies available, 2 of which were in french. Both my table and my husbands did not work and we had to balance our hot meals on our laps. But we thought ok these things happen, we'll have a nice new plane on our return to the UK. We couldn't have been more wrong. We checked in and were told by Thomas Cook that our plane had again been changed. We had booked extra leg room seats so I asked the representative to confirm that our seats were extra leg room. He asked to see our itinerary to check that we had booked them and informed us that our seats were definitely extra leg room. As we boarded however, we discovered our seats were not extra leg room. We were told that the plane was fully booked and that they would check if any seats were available when all passengers were boarded. A swissport agent then boarded with no apology and said there was nothing she could do and quickly walked off the aircraft. The planes both going to Las Vegas and returning were filthy, there was chewing gum stuck to the chair in front of me and old sweet wrappers stuck in the magazine racks. There were food and drink stains all over the food trays and on asking for blankets on the outward flight the hi fly representative informed me there were none and looked at me as if I was crazy for asking even though the plane was absolutely freezing. I am absolutely shocked at the treatment and customer care that both Thomas Cook and Swissport have shown their customers and will never book with Thomas Cook again.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
Booked with Thomas Cook as we were supposed to be flying their new Airbus, prebooked all seats and meals, received an email to say change of aircraft now "hi fly". The plane was filthy, not fit for a long haul flight, the entertainment - 4 films two of which were in French, mine and my daughters screens didn't work going or coming back. One of my prepaid for gluten free meals never materialized. The seats, screens and floors were a mess, and to top everything off my youngest was sick and there wasn't even a sick bag in any of the pockets. Very disappointed with the flight going and returning.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
MAN to MCO return in August 2015. My wife is American so we fly transatlantic at least three times per year, using mainly BA (silver), AA and Virgin. We decided to give TC a go as they had new cabins and have launched routes to many of our fav US destinations from our local airport (MAN). Verdict - fantastic value with excellent service. From check in at both ends with no queue, to premium only air bridge boarding, large comfortable seats, high quality video, good standard of food, plentiful bar service and extremely friendly and attentive service. Both legs arrived early and bags off first. As a direct comparison to Thomson with whom we flew to PVR (Mexico) in June, TC wins hands down. We will definitely fly with TC again, no other airline offers the same value for money across the pond at the moment.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
We booked with Thomas Cook specifically for the new, refurbished planes, but both were replaced with filthy alternatives there and back. We married in Vegas and this was our honeymoon. This was the much hyped inaugural flight from Stansted to Vegas. Our seats had insufficient leg room and were 3 wide, so absolutely no room to move. My seat did not recline, so, when my back started aching (every 30 minutes or so) I had to stand in the aisle. I was offered another seat, but I'd paid the extra to sit with my wife. The trim on my seat and the armrest were falling off. I just hoped the mechanical bits were in better shape. The so called entertainment package was pitiful. 5 films, 2 in French and were the same going back. We live 2 miles from Gatwick, but spent £200 in return taxi fares to Stansted to fly on the all new and improved planes. No explanations or apologies. Virgin Atlantic's prices are comparable and fly from Gatwick. Why oh why didn't I fly with them? I will be from now on.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
We booked our holiday with Thomas Cook flexi trips, 3 weeks to departure had an email to say change of aircraft, we are now flying with Hi Fly. What a joke these aircraft's are, dirty seats, the seat in front of me had chewing gum stuck on it, and on return it was still there. Orlando is the home of Disney, my young son was so excited to have his own monitor to watch some films etc, only to find he had a choice of four, none of which were suitable for him, and on our return it was the same four films. Complained to Thomas Cook rep on aircraft and even she was embarrassed by the entertainment on offer. Recommend you never fly with this company if at all possible.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
Modern and clean aircraft, plenty of legroom. Seats were a little hard but I've never come across a comfortable seat in economy - they don't recline but I think this is a good thing. The toilets were in a little downstairs area in the middle of the aircraft and were manned by a steward, so no queues of people waiting in the aisles for the toilet. Seat back entertainment showing films, TV and radio, upgraded to Premium entertainment package for £4 each, well worth it (bring your own earphones although you can also buy theirs). USB in seat back to recharge your devices as well. Food was usual airplane fare, outward flight was James Martin meal which was quite tasty, better than return flight. Snacks and ice cream provided as well. Crew were polite and efficient, smooth flight and no delays. Flew with Virgin Atlantic a few years back and this was a far better experience.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
The plane was chartered in for this flight. Our seats were filthy, I needed to ask for wipes to clean the trays, seat back pouches were full of crumbs and coverings dirty. Magazines grubby. Staff agreed that there was an issue with the standard of cleanliness. The seats were very uncomfortable particularly in upright position and very cramped. Two gin and tonics and a coke cost £12.20 and were not chilled. Thomas Cook Airlines staff suggested that I should complain to customer services. Although they were polite it was difficult to get a glass of water as there were so few of them dealing with a large number of passengers.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
On arrival we checked our cases in, not surprised to find only a small queue. Both the flight out and back took off on time. I am 6 foot 3 and even I had enough leg room. Despite the flight only been 2.5 hours we still had a movie to watch. The breakfast we were served was okay however the roast dinner on the returning flight was very filling and tasty. Would recommend.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
We were told we would be flying in the new Airbus, we pre-booked seats both ways. 3 weeks before flying the plane was changed and we ended up on a sky high plane that was not fit for long haul. 2 toilets out of order, same on way back, then the forward toilet had no water to wash hands. On the way back the entertainment was 4 films, 2 French with subtitles - same films on way back. Everyone's pre-booked seats were mucked up. Worst long haul flights I have been on. The size of the seats and leg room are a joke as well as the cleanliness.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
This was meant to be Thomas Cooks first flight from London Stansted to Las Vegas, brilliant marketing and PR at the airport, USA flags, Rat pack band playing. Unfortunately it was delayed by 3 hours leaving Stansted and 1 hour on the return from Vegas. Both times the Thomas Cook plane wasn't available so it was replaced with a hi-fly plane which take the award for being the dirtiest planes I've travelled on. Video screens didn't work, food requested not available on the way out sausage and mash only on the way out, trays, screens and back of seats with food and stains on them, even the window screen had splatters of something all up them. I had to scrub the food trays and screens before we could use, the return flight was just as bad with the same rubbish films and dirty plane. My advice is fly with someone else if you can.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
Flew on first flight from Stansted to Cancun. The new plane not ready so flew Hi Fly. Plane not fit for a 10 hour flight. Prebooked seats but the one closest to the window was smaller and curved with the shape of the plane. Problems with controlling the cabin temperature either hot to the point of feeling sick or extremely cold. In flight entertainment a joke - 4 films 2 French with subtitles. Same films for both journeys. Plane very dirty, toilets filthy. Do not fly long haul with Thomas Cook.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
Having flown with Virgin, Emirates and British Airways in the past I must say the inflight entertainment is truly poor in comparison even if you pay the £4 per person for extra films and programmes. The food was good but again if you would like more drinks they come with a price tag, seemingly like everything else on the flight. If you book with the larger airlines well in advance they are not vastly more expensive but you do get much more for your money, I won't be flying with Thomas Cook Airlines again in a hurry! !

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
Just would like to say that myself and family (four adults) flew with Thomas Cook premium economy from Manchester to New York and back. I think it was excellent value for money. Staff were all very friendly and extremely helpful. The food was excellent and there was a good choice of films. Blankets and pillows provided - great for night flight.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
Just flown from MAN to MCO in Thomas Cook Premium Economy. Thought it was great value for money £1500 less than Virgin. Crew were great my son has aspergers and they were wonderful with him. New premium economy seats are very comfortable. IFE kept us entertained for 8hours. All in all would unequivocally recommend it.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
I recently flew with Thomas Cook airlines with my family on our annual holiday. Overall, the staff were friendly yet did not offer their assistance until asked (multiple times). The flight was tolerable, the extra leg room is slightly overrated as well as the entertainment which was a disney movie which blacked out multiple times. The food on board was slightly overpriced although that was to be expected and I was happy with my mobile connections while on board. My flight was only a 2.5 hour journey although the seats were uncomfortable they were tolerable for that amount of time. On arrival to our destination family and the rest of the passengers were left to our own devices when travelling to our hotels with no help from Thomas Cook whatsoever, which was disappointing.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
Flew with this airline Premier Class in both directions, a complete waste of money. Although the airline's main selling point was "Extra Leg Room" this was diminished immediately the person in front decided to recline their seat and deposit their head on your lap. The hostesses answer "They are entitled to do so you can recline yours", I did not want to in fact I was half way through watching an on board movie when the screen vanished from view. Superior food - definitely not - the same old poor served with plastic forks and containers that collapse on you. Thomas Cook take a tip from your competitors and work up to a good standard and not down to a poor level. Maximum of four free drinks counting on the one served to you on arrival on the aircraft, providing you can find a hostess. Very uncomfortable seats especially after tolerating 9 hours of them. You cannot comfortably move around the cabin as the aisles are frequently blocked by passengers from the economy cabin using the toilets when their toilets are full.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
We paid £80 each return for extra legroom seats which were 8cde and f. The seats were in the middle by the embarking and disembarking doors. There was plenty of legroom but on the outward journey people kept walking round the plane and stepping over our feet. The seats did not recline nor have the same headrests as on Virgin. Not as much space either. There were 4 films to watch, the same on both outbound and inbound flights. Your own headphones fitted into seats so don't purchase any. On return flight we departed at 7.50 pm from Cuba but had to wait until 10 pm for our meal and they did not dim the lights until midnight. Staff on outbound flight unfriendly. Would not want to use this airline long haul again.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
They make some very big claims about what they provide (new aircraft, personalised in-flight entertainment) and then a few weeks before going they send an email saying that we were being transferred to an airline we had never heard of. What's worse (I have three young children) is that the personalised entertainment goes and a centrally-controlled - very non-children centric - system is in. 10.5 hr flight with literally nothing for the kids to do. Thomas Cook make promises, they break promises, their customer service team don't care. All in the "terms and conditions" you see - think very very carefully before booking. And I write this as a lifelong customer who will never book with them again.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
I was worried about flying with Thomas Cook but everything went well, no problems at all. Staff were all friendly and helpful but still professional from check in to the cabin crew. The only thing is the size of the aircraft which seems to be designed to squeeze as many in as possible, I'm only 4ft 11 so I was fine but my boyfriend who is tall was rather uncomfortable so will need extra leg room next time.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
This was the first time I have flown with TCA and would definitely use them again. Price paid was very reasonable for a transatlantic flight and the quality of service and food was excellent.

First long haul flight on Thomas Cook. Good seat with good legroom, nice food, very good price. Departure both ways on time.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
Flew today from Manchester to Miami. I upgraded to Premium Class for 150 pounds more. Total price one way was 430 pounds. Let me also state that no other airline runs a Manchester to Miami non stop route. Premium Class also comes with priority check in, priority security line, priority boarding and first off bags at the destination airport. I fly all over the world frequently, and have flown on many airlines and have to say that the flight I took on Thomas Cook today was probably one of the best flights I have taken. From Check in to baggage claim, staff were extremely polite and friendly. The plane was a brand new A330. The seats were very comfortable with good recline. The plane was clean. The entertainment system was easy to use, had a good selection of movies, TV shows and music and it had a USB charging port. I never usually eat the meal when I fly, but I did on this occasion as the food was excellent. The drinks selection was also impressive with lots of premium name brands.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
Great flight with Thomas Cook on an A321 aircraft, flight left on time and arrived early. Cabin crew were very good and friendly. The seats on the plane were new and you felt like you had more space, I paid for extra legroom in seat 12A and its was great. Return flight left and arrived on time.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
Thomas Cook Airlines really seem to have got their act together. I used to prefer Monarch as a better holiday airline, but they have been deteriorating while Thomas Cook has improved immensely - some of this may be due to the recently refurbished A330s that we flew to the Dominican Republic on. Cabin staff were excellent. Food was pretty good in Economy (inbound), but very good in Premium (outbound). Legroom was very good/excellent in both cabins (and I'm 6ft 3 in). Excellent entertainment (free in premium, £4 in economy). To be honest, this was better than some scheduled flights I have been on.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
Very little room to manoeuvre, little to no leg room. Flight was so cold we asked for blankets and was told there was not enough so we froze for 10 hours, no apologies from staff, in fact I don't think the staff wanted to be there, no communication when throwing your very basic meal at you with not even a smile. 2 meals provided, one is a snack, very small portions for men and 2 free drinks, one with each meal - we asked for a drink and was told the trolley was coming soon, had to wait 40 mins. If you want to watch movies its free for 3, one being a childrens then £4 if you want a wider range, when on a 10 hour flight this should be free. When on a long flight we thought it was encouraged to move around the cabin when trying to do so we were told to sit down. Overall appalling service.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
Travelled with family for a holiday in Skiathos. Great flights on both directions. Outbound flight left on time with friendly and professional cabin crew. Breakfast was delicious with sausage, bacon, omelette, tomato compote, yoghurt, banana and maple muffin and orange juice. Landed at Skiathos around 15 minutes early. Our inbound flight back to Stansted was around 45 minutes late. This was apparently due to one of the pilots originally scheduled for the flight from Stansted being taken ill and a relief pilot needing to take his place. On this flight we had a choice of Beef Hickory of Tandoori Chicken. I choose the Tandoori Chicken, which was tasty. The cabin crew on this flight were also friendly and professional. Despite the delay, we managed to make up lost time and landed back at Stansted only 5 minutes late. Thomas Cook Airlines have certainly improved their image since I last flew with them, which was around 2008.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
My partner and I just returned from a long-haul flight to Orlando and travelled both ways in the refurbished Premium Cabin. The cabin interior mirrors the new livery. The first two hours including priority check-in, fast track security and priority boarding worked like a dream and we were relaxing in our seats with a glass of bubbles and some nibbles before we knew it. The cabin staff were welcoming, professional and friendly. The new seats are wide enough for most shapes and sizes and the legroom affords a very comfortable flight. Complimentary newspapers,  Marie Claire and inflight magazine available. A drink service and wine service before dinner is served. The James Martin lunch offering was some of the tastiest airline food we've had, followed by ice cream and a cream tea before arrival. Priortiy Bag Collection and it took only 30 minutes before we were picking up our rental car. The return trip was of comparable quality and we would thank Thomas Cook for taking good care of us.

I was persuaded to fly Thomas Cook from Manchester to Montego Bay as Premium service. Unfortunately 10 days before flight I was told that the plane had changed, no premium service available and I couldn't guarantee legroom seats or my wife and I sitting together! I am 6'6" tall and must have legroom - had to work very hard to get it! Was promised premium services on flight (welcome drinks, in-flight drinks, special meals, amenity kit, headphones etc.) none of which transpired. Staff on outbound flight very nice and  did what they could to accommodate us - managed to arrange two legroom seats side by side, for instance. Long noisy flight, drunk rowdy passengers behind us. Food very poor - though recommended by 'celebrity chef James Martin'. Return flight less noisy, couldn't sleep though. Staff much less helpful, talked among themselves, didn't offer much service - threw breakfast at passengers without warning us to set our tables etc.! They were surly and unwelcoming. Flights were smooth, pilots kept us aware of where we were, conditions at destination etc. Seats were very uncomfortable for a long flight and crew had closed access to front lavatories, so there were too few available for customers. My complaints about lack of notice of change and great disappointment with the different experience than that I was expecting have all been ignored by Customer Services - not even an acknowledgement! Customer service by Thomas Cook head office staff absolutely non-existent. I will certainly find another airline for future flights.

Legroom is typical but seats and plane was comfortable enough. The seats were leather, no inflight entertainment but the flight was only 2hrs 35mins. The meal was amusing it consited of scrambled egg, tinned tomato and a muffin. It was free though so I couldn't complain. I enjoyed it well enough. The cabin crew were attentive and polite, I found check in was easy and the A321 was fairly quiet.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
The aircraft was great, plenty of leg room etc, films great and staff attentive. However, the meals were not brilliant. I requested a Gluten free meal as I am coeliac. I got the said meal but where was the chef's imagination for this special dietery food? My main dinner was ok but why  do we always get served a seeded brown roll? Where were the gluten free crackers to go with the cheese? And why do we always get a hard green apple? My family all had 'normal' food - lucky them, crackers for cheese and cheesecake dessert. I know there are Gluten free crackers around and I also know there are individual pot desserts. Breakfast was a yoghurt a fruit drink and a muffin, why couldn't I have a white bread roll with jam and butter and the muffin and juice? On a good note my family thoroughly enjoyed their meals.

Just been on a 4 hour flight from Crete to Manchester. The plane was a good big wide bodied plane and the flight itself was good. However, the plane was freezing the air con was so high, the seat also did not recline but I could cope with that, it was just the cold so was really uncomfortable.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
The flight was basically OK. However, I booked priority bags for myself and wife both ways but did not receive the service as the bags came off the aircraft without having been given any apparent priority and some time after the first bags came off. There seemed to be two separate issues with the service. On the outbound flight the bags were not tagged by the check-in desk and so were not identified as priority bags. On the inbound flight, I had to point out that we had paid for priority bags at the check-in, otherwise they were not going to be tagged, but even then the bags came on to the carousel on arrival in a completely random order, the first of any tagged bags arriving about 40th, the next 60th and ours some time after that. So, there was a problem at both check-in and arrival. A further problem became apparent when I made a complaint. The customers service agent offered a 50% refund on the mistaken belief that I was only complaining about one flight and has not been prepared to budge in spite of numerous e-mails to put the record straight so I am afraid with Thomas Cook it's "No Priority Bags" and "Bad Customer Relations".

The only problem I have with booking through Thomas Cook is being tied into their airline for flights. Recently flew between Glasgow and Corfu, as a seasoned traveller on both scheduled and charter around the world they are easily the worst airline I've ever flown with. That included single prop local flights in the back of beyond. They are clearly letting their aged 757-200's slowly but surely crumble with the newer A321's being brought in as replacements. Having flown on several 757's I knew to expect cramped seating and miniature tray tables. However allowing the interior trim of your aircraft to fall into disrepair is unacceptable. On the outbound flight, on one of the older 757's in the fleet the toilets were looking decrepit and I noticed the tray table of the person next to me was sagging on one side. The cabin crew are friendly enough, however on the outward bound service they were extremely slow bringing the trolley down for drinks, it took a good 2.5 hours for the breakfast service to begin (around 11.30 UK time) so by then we were pretty hungry having been awake since 5. The duty free service didn't make it past row 7, and there was never a second drinks service. The inbound journey however was even worse, there was a piece of foam hanging down between the front galley and the bulkhead. The armrest on my seat was broken, with the trim hanging off the top and the seat recline button jammed in. Which I ended up fixing myself with the trim just being placed back on top. During takeoff water dripped down onto the seat next time mine, I pointed this out to the cabin crew who seemed relatively uninterested when they finally came around after a 10 minute wait from pressing the buzzer. The food on the return leg turned out to be two spicy options, chicken curry and braised beef. For some bizarre reason there were chillies through the beef. Flown with the airline three times now and had 2 awful experiences, won't use them again.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
I'd never normally fly with someone like Thomas Cook but only did so because very few low-cost airlines go to Tunisia. Their website seems quite long-winded but would recommend doing on-line check-in as essentially jumped the queue at the airport desk. Reserved seating was horrifically expensive but we did it anyway. Unfortunately we had one of the older A321's both ways so the cabin was looking a bit old and tired but adequate for a 2hr 40min flight but on the plus side cabin crew were very friendly. Didn't bother with in-flight meals but good enough selection of drinks and snacks, and averagely priced as airlines go. Both the outbound and inbound flights were on time which was a bonus as have heard bad things about Thomas Cook's flight punctuality. Would fly them again but probably only if I had to as they're no better than the low-cost carriers who even with the extras are considerably cheaper.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
Our outgoing flight was uneventful and the staff were friendly, but a couple of the staff on the return flight both sounded and appeared totally bored and disinterested. The safety procedures were gabbled by them in such a hurried robotic way that on 3 occasions they had to repeat a sentence as they had jumbled up their words. There was no eye contact with customers, let alone a warm smile. On both flights, the seats are so close together that for many passengers, the trays cannot be pulled down flat, which is dangerous with hot food and hot drinks. Decaffeinated drinks are always recommended on flights, but not offered. The staff did find one for me in each direction, but of course it isn't part of the regular drinks on offer, so I had to wait until they'd finished taking out the other drinks, All in all we did feel a bit of a nuisance being there at all.

Our party of four flew to Dalaman, Turkey by Thomas Cook. Never again, the flight is 3.5 hours long and after 1.5 hrs the flight crew announced they were having a break of half an hour. We, the passengers, were to order our drinks before their break because they would not be taking orders during their break. I was not allowed to use the loo nearest the cockpit because that was were their break was taking place, I had to queue at the other two loos! The seas are jammed together, the trays are higher up than average to be able to allow less leg room.

Just got back from Lanzarote to Manchester - 15 hours late. On arriving at the airport we queued at the check-in as normal to be handed a letter that told us the flight was delay until the next day with no explanation as to why and no rep in sight. The letter explained we'd be taken to a hotel and provided with 1 meal and a drink. The next morning we were made to leave for the airport at 6.45am again not great with two small children! Finally got to the airport to again be greeted by another letter and no rep saying we are now flying with HiFly airline and again delayed by another hour. What an experience that was the plane was awful there was no inflight entertainment and the staff didn't speak English and constantly argued due to the amount of pressure they were under. Not a great experience and definitely not worth the money we paid. This flight was worse than a budget airline so why it was sent to collect us I will never know. Very poor customer service and I will not be booking a package holiday with them again.

My husband and I travelled from Lanzarote to Glasgow on Thursday 21 May 2015 on flight TCX3413. We arrived at the airport at 3.45 pm our flight was due to depart at 5.15 pm. We had already booked our boarding passes online but discovered this facility was not in use and ended up queuing for about 45 minutes. There was four check ins and one was reserved for priority boarding and used for approximately 25 minutes. We had to wait another 30 minutes before it was used for other passengers. By the time we got through checking in it was about 4.30 pm. We checked the board to find the departure gate was No 2. There was a queue forming at the gate and we joined it thinking that we would be boarding in time for take off at 5.15 pm. No information was given regarding the flight being delayed. At 5.30 we were told that the flight was delayed and could not give us any more information she told us to take a seat and wait. There was very few seats available. It was 6.30 pm when it was finally announced that there was a computer fault. By this time we had been standing for over three hours. I understand there can be delays but what I don't understand is that there was no other Thomas Cook rep there to keep us informed as to what was happening. The flight finally left at 8.15 pm we arrived home at 2.00 am. It spoiled the end to our holiday and cost us money for a taxi as the person picking us up was working that morning and was unable to come for us.

My husband and I flew to Las Vegas from Manchester on May 6th 2015 on a refurbished Airbus 330. I was pleasantly surprised how good it was plenty of leg room (my husband is 6ft) food was very tasty and the staff were pleasant and helpful. After reading bad reviews of Thomas Cook it was with some trepidation I boarded the plane however they were quickly dispelled when I saw the onboard seat configuration (2x4x2) and the TV screen on the seat in front. I flew to New York with American Airlines once who had 2 TV screens for the whole plane showing Disney films - yes you pay for Premium films and a headset it's £6 the exact same holiday with Virgin was a £1000 more expensive ! ! Would definitely fly with Thomas Cook again.

Booked a cruise which uses Thomas Cook Airlines. After my last flight with them I said I would never fly with them again but on this occasion we had no choice. Staff are great the flights were on time both ways but I cannot cope with how small the space is between you and the row in front. The space is that small you can't get your tray table down properly and I'm by no means overweight. they need to stop trying to pack so many people in I certainly won't fly with them again.

Having read so many poor reviews prior to travelling to Holguin Cuba on the 27th April I was pleasantly surprised by our flight. The staff were all charming and worked so hard. We recently flew to India with Emirates airline. the leg room was just as good as a scheduled airline the food was just as good the staff were just as good. Obviously flight a lot cheaper so seats a little harder no free drinks etc. I would definitely use airline again. Kind staff for a nervous passenger too.

Boeing 757-200 MAN-SSH rtn. We travelled to and from Sharm el Sheikh and I must say what an awful aircraft they used for a 5.5 hour flight. Seats really crammed together - no inflight entertainment at all - and by the looks of it the plane must have been 20yrs+ old. On the way back home - we boarded the plane and shortly after we were told there was a problem with the aircon - we had to wait for an engineer to turn up - so that was an extra hour sat in them horrible seats waiting to leave. The aircraft issues aside - the cabin crew were alright - apart from when they started their break and someone was pressing the attention bell but none of the crew moved to see what the passenger wanted. After the bell had been rung 3-4 times the crew eventually came out. Surely if the bell is rung they could take it turns to see what the issue is.

LGW-ACE pleasantly surprised to find we were flying on an Airbus A330 which we were informed had recently been refurbished and was very nice inside. Flight left on time and aircraft was very quiet and smooth. About an hour into the flight my wife felt unwell just nausea she was well looked after by cabin crew. We had pre-booked seats and a meal which to be honest was terrible. So to sum up nice aircraft and cabin crew but do not bother with meals.

My wife and I flew from Manchester to Varadero Cuba departing 10th April 2015 and returning 24th April. We have flown with Thomas Cook Airlines several times over the years - never again! We have noticed over the last few years the airlines practice of offering the opportunity to pre-allocate your seat by paying an additional charge. So we've waited for the airlines to start deliberately splitting couples and families up. It's started! At check- in at Manchester Airport we were allocated seats next each other. However one of the cabin crew came down the aisle followed by a couple and told me "there has been a mix up at check-in these people have paid for your seat". I showed her my boarding pass clearly printed with my seat number and explained that everybody on the plane had paid for their seat! She told me that these people had paid extra to pre-book their seat my argument wasn't with them and I gave up my seat to sit in the row behind my wife. The member of cabin crew explained that - according to Thomas Cook Airlines definition - this was classed as "next to" my wife! These seats were in a central 3 configuration and the lady next to me in the middle seat told me her husband was five rows back. The lady on the other end of the three told me she had asked for a window seat next to her husband she was placed in an aisle seat two rows in front of her husband. The return flight started in similar vein. We were allocated seats in rows one behind the other. These were in a middle four configuration so imagine my reaction when we found that my wife was seated next to family of three and I was in the row behind next to a couple. Simple solution - I waited until the passenger arrived for the remaining seat next to me and asked him if he would swap with my wife which he was only to glad to do. As we were doing this we found out that half the plane had swapped seats in order to sit with their friends and families. This Mass Musical Chairs totally confused the cabin crew who had no idea who was where. Add to this the fact that you now have to pay for headphones pay for entertainment pay for meals (this was a joke the cabin crew had a list of who had ordered meals but this bore no resemblance to the seating list they were supplied with). Eventually they just handed out meals to anybody who wanted one! Sorry Thomas Cook you're losing customers with your greed. Even Ryanair tell you in advance you're going to get ripped off - they don't pretend it's anything else certainly not a benefit or an upgrade which you are trying to pretend you are "offering". Never again!

We recently holidayed in Cuba with Thomas Cook (3rd to 17th April) and apart from being forgotten and left behind at the hotel in Havana (were told we could use the toilet then the bus immediately left without us - they did return) the holiday itself was excellent. Both hotels were wonderful but having paid a total of £200 each to upgrade to premium economy we were really disappointed with the flights. Leaving Manchester was brilliant as we were duly given 'priority boarding' ushered through quickly smiling attendants assuring us we'd 'paid for it' and at Varadero airport our luggage arrived first having also received priority treatment. However that seemed the full extent of the perks. Despite the promised of being "able to watch a selection of the latest blockbuster movies and our favourite classic movies hit TV shows and radio channels" we found it was impossible to listen without purchasing headsets - clever wording indeed! Further although the website shows a number of goodies available in premium economy (drinks newspapers etc) none of these are available until May (not made clear.) Worst of all however was the lack of priority treatment on the way home. While there was one queue for 'priority' there were two lanes for 'VIP' so that a couple that paid £20 each to enjoy air-con and freebie drinks and eats at the airport were prioritised and ushered through a good twenty minutes before us. Our luggage was treated with similar disregard and given no priority at all trundling out long after many others had left causing us to miss our booked train home! While on the flight back we begged the staff to warm up the cabin. In row 7 the fans were blowing icy air right around our heads/necks and the crew seemed completely unable to rectify it so we got very little sleep at all (the sleep situation being worsened by people stomping through from the cabin behind to use the front loos - with there only being 1 toilet between 49 of us this resulted in frequent and frankly unnecessary queuing. So my advice to you is think long and hard before paying out to turn left with Thomas Cook - I'm really not sure it was worth stacking another £400 on our holiday!

I recently flew from Manchester to Orlando return with my partner and son. We flew out on 27th March on flight TCX 724 in economy on a refurbished airbus A330. The flight left on time the crew were pleasant and the food (vegetarian meal) was surprisingly edible. The seats were quite hard but bearable. There was basic in flight entertainment but you could upgrade to the better entertainment package for £4. My son did this and he seemed to think it was worth it. We returned to Manchester on 7th April on flight TCX 415 in economy. This flight was late departing Orlando due to a disturbance on the plane during boarding. This was dealt with quite professionally by the all male cabin crew and the flight returned to Manchester without further incident. Overall I would recommend Thomas Cook airlines. We priced up the same flights with Virgin Atlantic and the Thomas Cook deal was several hundred pounds cheaper. I appreciate that the Virgin price is all inclusive but even taking into account the extras such as baggage seat choice meals and drinks on board the total price was still significantly cheaper than Virgin. I believe that Thomas Cook do not fly every day to Orlando as Virgin do however if your holiday dates coincide with the Thomas Cook flight timetable I definitely feel it is worth comparing the prices to Virgin. I would absolutely use Thomas Cook again for a long haul flight.

Flew last week to Gran Canaria flight was a bit late leaving plane packed. Flight back late paid for seats for me and my son found other passengers in our seats so crew seated us in other seats. Really disorganised when I contacted Thomas Cook about this they said that we had sat in our booked seats although there was no way of them knowing this as non of the crew knew our names or even where we were sitting.

Flight 352 and 353 from Manchester to Varadero. I was dreading this long haul flight with TC after reading all bad reviews but we really had a pleasant journey with this company. Cabin was nice felt not cramped at all and the seats where comfortable although we paid extra to have more leg room . Entertainment on board was ok food nice and the crew very professional . I flew long haul with other companies eg virgin atlantic and I have to say TC is miles better. I will definitely fly Thomas Cook again.

I travelled with Thomas Cook from Manchester to Holguin (Cuba) on 16th March 2015 returning 2 weeks later. The flight ended up costing a lot as I had to pay extra for everything (food drink entertainment 'upgrade' dropping bag off early having check in luggage choosing seat etc). The outward journey ended up being a nightmare because I was ill with a vomiting virus - clearly not Thomas Cook's fault but in the circumstances I expected them to help in some way or at least be sympathetic as I was travelling alone. Shockingly the majority of the cabin crew were not only unsympathetic and wanted nothing to do with me but in a couple of cases were actually unpleasant and rude. I felt really weak dehydrated and of course upset that this was the start of my holiday. Luckily some of the passengers were worried about me and offered advice and help in stark contrast to most of the cabin crew. Passenger welfare and safety is meant to be TC's first priority. I will not be flying with them again.

TCX 134 and TCX 135 Cuba 6th January 2015 to 21st January. After many trips with TC I can honestly say the changes on the flight in January were very noticeable. The seat was comfortable with ample room for legs and seat widths were good. Not cramped at all. The TV worked. The food was good (Vegetarian) and the staff were very polite and professional. I had vowed never to travel TC again after the last 3 flights were nothing short than abysmal. I am pleased that TC have made these changes. Well Done TC I am going to remain a regular flyer.

A330 March 2015. We regularly fly out on P&O charters to Barbados to join cruises. We have flown both Thos Cook and Thomson in the past. Our most recent flight prior to this was with Thomson on board its new Dreamliner Premium out and Economy return. Therefore we can compare and contrast. We chose Thos Cook on this occasion as we prefer the two seat window configuration (no premiums availability with Thomson or Thos Cook). I found the crews professionalism and standard of service very good possibly the best we have experienced on a P&O charter. The new configuration is a vast improvement on its predecessor however not as roomy as the Dreamliner. The new seats I found hard and rigid without any recline facility( which can be a double edged sword. The greater number of loo facilities is most definitely an improvement on the Dreamliner. The in flight entertainment came a poor second to Thomson. Overall for comfort I would choose the Dreamliner but book center aisle seats.

After just returning from a perfect weeks all inclusive holiday in Tunisia I only wish the travelling by the company's airline could have been the same. OK so the A321 aircraft are quite new but why do they have to cram so many seats into them. I found it very hard to enjoy my pre booked meal with the tray down and I am a normal sized male adult god help anyone who is rather portly. They plug the James Martin meals in all the booking info would have been nice to enjoy them I know it comes down to cost but they don't give customers comfort to start the holiday. Just a point to make if it does come down to cost how much does it cost them to pay a crew 14 hrs or so duty to change over an aircraft in Newcastle on a W leg from its base in Manchester oh by the way the mini bus broke down en route making the flight from Newcastle one hour late on departure back to Tunisia for us plus notes excellent service from the more mature male cabin crew used on both flights get some seats out think about the customers.

Appalling service facilities and value for money. Paid £590 for 2 upgrades to Economy Plus on flight to Cancun in March 2015. Was appalled to find that the only thing my £590 got me was a bigger seat. They had the cheek to ask me to pay for the premium entertainment upgrade and headphones and my drinks. There was no separate queue for premium check-in and I had to pay to use the premium lounge. The staff were rude and unhelpful and the pilot gave us the wrong time when we landed meaning me missed the welcome meeting the next morning. I will never fly Thomas Cook again or book any holidays through this travel agent.

Well we flew on the 19th August to Bulgaria from Gatwick with TC. This flight was the most boring flight I have experienced! Boarding was fine on time etc but the plane was dark dingy uncomfortable seats with food in the tray tables no IFE for 3.5 hours and not much space apart from legroom. Unfortunately I'm flying on this aircraft again this year.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
Delayed flight and then 4 members from our party didn't have seats (even though they had boarding passes and seats had been paid for). Apparently it was a mix up when the flight was changed to a Thomson flight. After tears and threats they managed to "find" some seats (not the ones we had paid for). Telling a 9 and 12 year old that they have to take their luggage off the plane is something the airline should be apologetic for but not TC. Never again and would not advise if you want to be treated like a human being.

Travelled to Cancun from Manchester on 28th January 2015. Several weeks prior to travel we were contacted by TC Airlines to be informed that the newly refurbished aircraft would be unavailable for this outbound flight no personal seat back screens but overhead screens instead and less leg room. A refund of £25 was given. Another week later another call the same happened for the inbound flight. The aircraft was quite shabby seat backs wonky causing trays not to be level. in-flight entertainment dismal that's when you could see a screen that worked correctly (PC tablets a must for own entertainment). Food was reasonable. The reason for booking with TC was the direct flights and the newly refurbished aircraft. Having travelled previously with Thomas Cook to the Canary Islands I was reluctant to travel long haul with them well next time I will travel non-direct just to avoid this pathetic excuse of an airline.

Flight TCX114 and 115 Manchester to Goa India. The flight was fair the food was fair but the entertainment for an eleven hour flight was disgraceful. A screen in the middle of cabin four rows in front of me sound quality very poor as plug didn't fit in socket tightly enough. What has happened to screen in seat back of seat in front and pick your own entertainment. Dreadful on a long haul flight.

Booked with Thomas Cook to fly from Gatwick to Tenerife. Disappointed to find you could only travel with 6kg. When we arrived at bag drop on our route back we were advised that we would have to pay 12 euro per person as we were early! Why as the gate was shown as open and there was a priority boarding as well as a normal gate open. Felt we were travelling with Ryanair. Never again will we choose to fly with Thomas Cook.

Flew from Egypt to Manchester in January 2015 and we were forced to refuel in Gatwick on what should have been a direct flight. The weather was horrendous. The pilot didn't explain what was happening. The flight attendants only served one drink during the whole flight and were rude and unfriendly. The seats were so uncomfortable and were a real squeeze. It seems clear to me that the plane we were on was not capable of making the journey and therefore shouldn't have been flying that route. When the new crew boarded in Gatwick they told us to fly Thomson's next time! Just a measure of what must be going on in the company. Will never book one of their holidays again.

Manchester to Cancun 18/12/14. We flew from Manchester to Cancun with Thomas Cook and against these other poor reviews it was a faultless flight. I've come to the conclusion that people only review if they have an unpleasant experience. I advise anyone reading this to fly with Thomas Cook long haul. It's a comfortable and friendly airline: Check in - no queues with many desks open and ready. Boarding - very fast and organised immediately onto plane. Plane interior - We flew on the new refurbished A330. The cabin was a 2-4-2 configuration and at the back a 2-3-2 configuration. Seats were comfortable and reclined slightly. There was a large amount of leg room and overhead lockers also. We flew economy but in premier economy at the front there was a 2-3-2 configuration. There was no significant difference. Slightly larger seats with a pillow and amenity kit but not much benefit in upgrading. Inflight entertainment - absolutely fantastic entertainment. Touch screen 8 inch screen on the back of each seat. Economy came with 5 films and around 100 different music albums which was fantastic ranging from pop to country all free. if you paid £4 you gained 20 films and 30 TV shows which most people did. Films could be paused forwarded etc. There was also a USB port and headphone plug in. There was games and a map saying how far you had left and time at destination etc. As well as immigration details and Thomas Cook videos. Staff - Cabin crew were all very friendly. Food - Cooked by James Martin and I did not eat but others said it was average. We received lunch and afternoon tea. Toilets - were more roomy than usual and fairly clean. I highly advise flying long haul with Thomas Cook. It had no delay great service and entertainment. The journey back was a different story. The seats were squashed dirty and impossible to sleep on. unless I was flying on the new refurbished cabins I would not fly with Thomas Cook. The new A330's are flawless but the old ones are disgusting. There was no entertainment and the cabin was old.

The Incredible Disappearing Cabin Crew. We flew out to Goa from Gatwick on 25 Jan the flight was fine food pretty good the upgrade cost for decent entertainment was a little annoying - thank goodness for iPads. The return flight on 9 Feb was a very different experience. I have never been so cold on a flight - I was wearing a T shirt cardigan fleece pashmina and my half share of a blanket and shivered all the way home. It seems we were lucky as many passengers further forward had no blankets at all. The cabin crew disappeared after dinner service not to be seen again until breakfast. My husband went to the galley to ask for coffee to warm us up a little and was told the crew were all sleeping and it would be at least an hour until we could get a hot drink. We never got that drink. I am really not sure what the purpose of this cabin crew was. Safety is the usual response but they even forgot to demo the lifejackets on the safety briefing! Very poor service Thomas Cook.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
Flew to Barbados via Antigua. Found the plane clean and comfortable at first with more than adequate leg room until the passenger in front decides to recline their seat! I was literally jammed into my seat. These seats should be fixed in the one position to make it fair for everyone! When it came to meal time my tray sloped at a 45 degree angle meaning my meal would have slid off the tray. Each time meals/drinks were served I had to ask the stewardess to ask the person in front to put their seat upright. Apart from that the plane is good. There are 7 toilets are located down a set of stairs which is ideal and gives plenty of space. There are also 2 toilets located at the front and rear of the plane. Food is good. We we're given 1 hot meal plus snacks and a mini Ice cream cone. Only thing that could have been improved is a cup holder so drinks could be held without having to have your tray down.

Manchester to Barbados and return. Outbound 25th January return 1 February. The flight was in the refurbished A330. The seats were good in economy but the lever for the recline was well hidden and nobody reclined their seats. It would have been nice if the crew pointed this out to the customers who are paying their wages. The food was ok but in small portions. The flight was smooth. The crew were professional. The return flight was the opposite. The crew from Barbados showed attitude and were not friendly compared to the outbound crew. The food service was 1 of the slowest I have ever seen in my whole life of long haul flying. When the food was actually served 2.5 hrs after take off we hit very bad turbulence. By the time you add up the cost of meals seat assignment purchasing drinks etc you are better of flying BA or Virgin. They provide inflight entertainment in their cost as well.

Flew on one of the refurbished A330 aircraft from Manchester to Barbados via St Lucia. The new premium seats have reasonable leg room and space even when the person in front reclines the seat. However they are quite firm and you could feel every movement of the person sitting next to you. The tray table folds out of the arm rest and is quite small. The food was fine and better than expected. At present it is economy service but I suspect it will be better when premium service is introduced in the summer schedule. At present you have to pay for everything drinks headphones and movie upgrades. We knew this but some expected them to be included. The crew were professional rather than friendly. The product is fair value for money. In effect it is better than a major airline economy class but not as good as premium economy offered by major airlines.

Airbus 321 East Midlands to Arecife/Lanzarote. Smooth quick check in at both airports. Flight left and arrived on time. Spotless cabin. Seats fine for my wife but not enough leg room for me. Why charge for headphones? Seems hardly worth the trouble of collecting a couple of pounds though I enjoyed the children's cartoon film. (I am 68!). Cabin staff were efficient and pleasant. Overall a good experience.

TCX172 26th December and TCX173 16th January. I must admit that I was dreading flying with Thomas Cook and became obsessed with reading the reviews trying to find a good one but I was very surprised and happy. we flew from Gatwick to Punta Cana on December 26th. Check in was a breeze and the flight was on time. The seats are fine we booked exit seats row 9 H and K so about 6 foot of room in front of us. The food was not bad the crew were lovely and didn't stop for the whole of the flight they were very chatty. The return flight was just as great I have no problem with flying with them again in fact after this flight I must admit that the service was far better than Virgin Premium Economy.

We used this poor excuse for an airline to travel to Cuba. Having paid for an upgraded seat I was presented with a seat that was broken! The lower padding of the seat was not secured to the rest of the seat and rode forward making a large gap at the rear. My return trip was wonderful I paid for the trip with Virgin Atlantic and left our Thomas Cook airline seats empty. This airline is a disgrace!

We flew to Barbados on 18th December 2014 in premium economy and were highly delighted. The leg room was 34" and the food on board is the best I have ever eaten on a plane (and I have flown many times). We had to pay for extra movies (£6.00) and we had to pay for drinks but when I priced our flight with Virgin (which we always fly with) the price was £3500 the price with Thomas Cook on premium economy was £1800 now £1700 difference to me was a lot and I was highly delighted with the service we received. If I had to fault one thing them it would be the stop over in St Lucia it was a little unorganised but once we had people settled in the flight to Barbados was 26 minutes so I can live with that. Would I fly with Thomas Cook again - yes I would after saving £1700.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
Just returned from Cuba my first ever long haul charter. Having flown all over Europe on TC have never been a fan of theirs due to the leg room and the attitude of the cabin crew. Always found them to be rude and up themselves. How my opinion has changed. The TC A330-200 was a lovely aircraft and the seats although of a bus style were comfortable enough for the 9 hour 40 min flight and the seat pitch was better great even for me at 6ft 4". The service was second to none and in comparison to my last Long Haul to Vegas with BA TC comes out on top.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
I would not recommend Thomas Cook. There were 6 of us flying to Fuerventura on 27th December. I paid £10 each for priority check in. After we had queued for about half an hour to check in I asked the very unhelpful man what I got for priority check in. He smiled and said nothing really you just get to go in this queue. I said but there are the same amount of people in this queue as all the others Yes he said again waste of money really wasn't it? When we got on board I was astonished at the small amount of space for seats. Might be me but seemed the smallest ever certainly no different to Ryanair. This is just like flying budget really without the opportunity for speedy booking. I see down below I am asked about inflight entertainment there was none. Food was poor choices and huge hoo ha about whether or not they had what we wanted.

Having flown with TC every year for 6 year to the canaries we decided on Mexico 5/11/2014 from Manchester I have to say it was a senior crew inbound and outbound they were fantastic a real credit to TC the flight was ok but the seating so tight and uncomfortable by the time we arrived my husband said never again we ask people who has upgraded they said not much better The holiday was great. We loved Mexico and would like to go back don't think my husband will return.

Have just returned from St Lucia flying with Thomas Cook and have to say they have been excellent. We flew premium both ways the food was excellent seat width fine and plenty of legroom will use them again for sure as they are certainly on a par with Virgin and B.A.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
We flew to Barbados on 4th December from Manchester had booked premium economy for both flights. Unfortunately on arriving at 7.30 to book in we were informed the plane had been changed due to 'operational' problems so no premium economy available also the flight was delayed and would not be leaving until 1 15pm we eventually departed at 2 15! Vouchers for £6 were given to all passengers to either spend on board or in airport for refreshments. The return journey leaving at 6 30pm was excellent and we sat in the premium economy seats we had selected meals on both flights were excellent. Special mention must be given to the flight crews on both journeys they were extremely helpful polite and though obviously tired on the outward journey remained happy and extremely professional in their roles.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
We travelled from Manchester airport to Holguin Cuba for a weeks holiday in November. We paid for extra leg room which amounted to £160 for two people return journey in addition to holiday costs. The outward journey was fine booked on row 30 seats not wide but extra leg room acceptable. On the return journey we sat in row 30 but seats "b" and "c". This was a disaster we were nearly run over by the cabin crew's equipment people were falling over my husbands feet and I spent the 8.30 hour flight acting like a health and safety officer warning others of the risk of injury. There were people gathered in the space we hired and the lady in seat "a" didn't pay any extra at all for this seat. I have complained to Thomas Cook and have been offered £40 in return but we paid £80. Do not book these seats as extra legroom as they are not and you will be wasting your money.

My return journey from Las Vegas to Manchester was delayed by 2 hours due to a fault on the original aircraft and a replace had to flown out from London. The plane was a different type of aircraft from the one I had flown to Las Vegas on this wasn't because of the fault as I had pre booked my seat and I noticed that premium wasn't available on this flight I also think the plane was different because this was the last flight from Las Vegas to Manchester as TC only run seasonal flights. The crew apologised for the delay once we were on board and all the channels on the on demand entertainment system was made available to all passengers on board as I believe some you had to pay for. My seat was on the front row in the centre section which had 4 seats the bulk head was a lot closer than I expected and the seats on the front row on the left and right hand side had more legroom. I have flew with TC to Vegas twice now and I had no real issues with them and I'm looking at booking in 2015.

I am 3 hours fresh off a flight from Kittilia to Manchester and can't believe the planes Thomas Cook provide to travel to such amazing destination's! The holiday in Finland (Lapland) was amazing 11/10 and the reps were top dollar too but the planes they are not worth 20p in scrap metal! I am 6ft and 18 stone and was completely crammed in a seat on this plane the seats were too narrow the leg room was non existent their was no inflight entertainment on the flight out to Levi Finland and the crew seemed very unapproachable. No inflight entertainment on a flight to Lapland with a plane 50% full of children is just insane. The crew have no reason to be unapproachable. I will go back to Lapland but it will not be with BA.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
I flew Manchester to Las Vegas in Oct originally I booked a front row seat in economy for a little extra leg room but passengers were offered for a fee an upgrade to premium economy I decide to take the offer and moved to premium which was more comfy as the seat is wider. The cabin crew were friendly and although it was a 10 hour flight it didn't seem to bad I didn't use the entertainment system as I had my tablet with me.

Flew with Thomas Cook December 3rd 2014 checked in at 6-45 told boarding starts at 9-40 watching the screens new departure time of 11-30. Then told further info at 12-00 - offered vouchers for food at 12-30 and eventually took off at 16.05. Whilst on the plane the captain lets us know the first plane had a defective door the second plane that had to be flown from Gatwick also had a problem which had to be fixed before it came to Manchester. On the positive side the staff were fantastic - they had also been on duty all day.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
After reading so many bad reviews I was actually afraid to fly with TC and didn't want to start enjoying holidays until I actually get to Cancun. However we were surprised! Everything went smoothly and everything was fine! Indeed seats are not as comfortable as in the usual airlines ( Virgin BA etc) but it was not that bad. Food was this same quality as with other airlines - it was good. Ice cream and mini cheese board was a very nice addition. Staff and service was great! Entertainment - not a great selection and for the best movies you need to pay. I watched couple of movies I haven't seen before. Modern screens - working on both flights - get your own earphones with you. I got my book and magazines to read with me. We got a blanked and a pillow on a night flight back. We bought our own bottle of water at the airport and paid for beer on a board. I like the seating plan that seems to be perfect for couples! It was very good flight (both ways)!

Flew Manchester - Cayo Coco - Manchester. Initially had a three hour delay flying out to Cuba but we were kept up to date with information and a spare plane was flown up from Gatwick. It was a newly refurbished A330 cabin with on demand entertainment which was great though the choice was fairly limited but better than the older A330 cabin entertainment systems. Flight back left on time and we even arrived into Manchester an hour ahead of schedule. Overall food was good staff were good. We couldn't complain at all. It may not be a glamour airline but TC does the job.

We flew long haul from Manchester to Cancun on 17th Oct returning 31st Oct. After reading some of the reviews on here I was dreading the flight. I can only say we didn't need to worry from check in to landing each flight was great. We paid extra each to have just 2 seats together at the back of the plane as my partner likes to look out of the window and I have a bad right leg so would have more room to stretch. This wasn't needed as the leg room was great even for my partner who is over 6ft. The attendants were very nice even though they were very busy. The food was good for airline food. We knew b4 hand the cost of drinks so bought water and coke at the airport. Never watched the films so I had put films I wanted to watch on my kindle so going I watched these and read a little coming back the same. My partner slept most of the way both trips and he said the seats were very comfy.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
My wife and I live on the Isle of Man and use Easyjet to connect with other flights. They allow you to check-in 3 weeks in advance for both the outbound and return flights together so I can't understand why this airline don't have a similar service. The reason for this became clearer on our return flight from Milas airport in Turkey. We weren't allowed to check-in online for the return journey so made sure we arrived at the airport well in advance which put us in around the first 30% of the queue. I don't believe that every other passenger on the flight would have booked their seat but maybe that was the case. As we class the flight as part of our holiday experience this was ruined by the fact that we were separated on the flight. The only reason I can think for them doing this is so that next time we book we pay extra for our seats except this will never happen as we won't ever fly with Thomas Cook again. As we normally sit together when travelling my wife usually carries the money water reading glasses magazines etc. along with my tablets as I'm diabetic. I don’t suppose this company would even be bothered about the hassle and inconvenience this would cause their customers. The real problem I have is the fact that the person who checked us in never mentioned this whatsoever and the first we realised is just before we got on the plane. A simple bit of common courtesy and an apology e.g. I'm sorry I have to split you up as the seats are all taken would have sufficed but not a mention. There is no possible excuse for this which makes it the worst customer service we've ever experienced and my wife and I have travelled all over the world on a lot of different airlines.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
This was the worst set of flights I have ever taken. Both directions were over 4 hours and overnight however the seats were the narrowest I have ever sat in and fixed in place. The seats were so small that it was not possible to hold a book normally but to have to hold it up much closer to your face and with so little space that they did not have space for a normal tray which meant when food came round there was not space to also have anything to drink. The food was awful and struggled to eat any of the hot meals which were of course an extra charge. There was no entertainment full stop. This was an awful experience but then every step of the way with Thomas Cook was an awful experience and would not recommend them to anyone. Every seat on the plane was reduced room and non- recline so paying to upgrade is not an option either.

Just got back from Barbados on the (now) infamous TCX816 fight which was delayed a few times. We initially sat on the plane for 4hrs without going anywhere (not good) due to technical problems. Eventually got off the plane and taken to a hotel which was very nice. Thomas Cook did everything possible to make the transition smooth staff very helpful and polite. Should have left 6.30pm Thursday eventually left around 4pm Saturday. Would like to thank Thomas Cook for doing everything they could with efficiency and polite staff. My only criticism was having to hang about waiting for further updates every few hours had they said 24 plus hrs delay we could have enjoyed extra time on the beach instead of hotel room waiting for calls.

LGW to Tenerife 17/10/14 returning 24/10/14 - both directions by B757-300. Cabin crew on both legs quite helpful - beverages a little pricey. I must say in 47 years of flying around this planet these two flights were without doubt the most uncomfortable I have had to endure the seats are far to narrow and are fixed. The seating plan was 3x3 after a 4 hr flight I felt cramped being unable to move about. If I am unfortunate enough to travel with this airline again I will first check which model of aircraft is being used if its a B757-300 I will change my travel arrangements. I travelled to Malta in June 14 with this airline in an Airbus aircraft which although had fixed seating it was far more comfortable - it is a wider aircraft unlike the B757-300 which is very narrow with 285 people crammed inside when full which it was on both legs of my journey.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
On our return flight to Las Vegas we found the seats far too narrow. Leg room was fine but width totally unacceptable. I couldn't use the controls on my arm rest as the person sat next to me completely obstructed them. In flight entertainment was not available on both legs of the flight but the crew sold ear phones for £3.00 each to all passengers. Totally unacceptable.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
We flew from Glasgow to Tenerife on 22nd October on a 14yr old Boeing 757-200. This must be one of the aircraft that Thomas Cook are retiring at the end of the year as it certainly looked its age! Legroom was as expected quality of the James Martin breakfast was predictably poor and the entertainment screens didn't work properly (I think a betamax tape was used)! Staff were helpful and approachable and carried out their tasks efficiently and professionally. Flight was more-or-less on time. Main criticism is Thomas Cook's lousy hand luggage allowance of 5kg if Jet2 can do 10kg and Easyjet unlimited why can Thomas Cook not do the same? Would fly with them again but if Jet2 was much the same fare I'd fly with them for thw simple reason that they allow 7kg extra per person (with hand and hold luggage combined).

I travelled with Thomas Cook on the 12th October from Newcastle to Tenerife flight time 0930. I decided to travel with Thomas Cook as it is a well known popular company and it's fair to say I will never travel with them again! The seats were uncomfortable - the leg room was poor. I asked for an extended seatbelt quietly as I was embarrassed but the cabin crew was not so quiet about it! The cabin crew going to Tenerife were not customer friendly. I overheard them moaning to each other about passengers needing the toilet. However the flight home on the 19th October at 1530 had lovely cabin crew who were so friendly and very good with the passengers. Also found that the aircraft were dirty in general. On balance I would never travel with Thomas Cook again was so disappointed with the at the start of my holiday! I think staff need extra customer service training.

24th October Birmingham to Heraklion. Boarding was hassle free and on time the crew were helpful and generally nice. However seats were torn arm rests were dirty and the overhead panel was wonky. I know that they are replacing the 757s with A321s which would counteract the mess. Food was good and plentiful. Knowing that there will be clean new aircraft I would fly Thomas Cook again.

1st Oct 2014 London Gatwick to Rhodes return 8th Oct TCX1487 Rhodes to London Gatwick. If you are thinking of booking a holiday with Thomas Cook my advice would be don't. We certainly expected more than the budget airline we received. Rigid upright chairs with a lump in the centre back that leaves you trying without success to gain a comfortable position to sit for the flight to Greece. We didn't expect food however on our outbound trip they offered snacks and drinks just into the flight we asked if we could get food and drinks later and were advised yes. When we did later ask we were told by a quite snotty stewardess that if we wanted something we would have to get it ourselves from the back - none of the purchase meals were available just chocolate crisps etc. On our return trip it was the same scrum to check in. Once boarded we now knew we had to have our knees under our seats so no shock. The staff on this flight were friendlier but the level of comfort is nil. We had a family behind us with two babies who screamed and screamed throughout the flight. Shame on Thomas Cook.

For the extra £400 to upgrade to Premium it was a joke. No extra legroom in row A planes were filthy staff were unapproachable on the return journey. Inflight entertainment did not work properly on the outbound and inbound journeys. Delayed on the runway for 2.5 hours on the return journey due to a runway being closed after an hour we were offered a small tub of water and a cereal bar which was 5 days our of date! The boarding card on the return journey stamper 'Business Class' absolute joke! Virgin airways are far superior and you get most things included in the price would never fly Thomas Cook again.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
Thomas Cook are not a family friendly airline. Following booking for a long haul flight we contacted Thomas Cook to request a bassinet for an infant however apparently Thomas Cook do not offer this service but we were not made aware of this at the time of booking. The only alternative is to pay for a full price seat and to bring your own car seat however if you do this no infant baggage allowance is given so you can add on an extra £200 for baggage alone. What a complete rip off. Bassinets are offered by other airlines which is who we will travel with in future as it's too late to do anything about it now. I will certainly never book flights with Thomas Cook again. What an appalling way to treat families travelling. Since we can't afford to pay another full price fare as well as the extra baggage fee on top of the existing holiday cost our poor little man will have to sit on our knees for the whole lengthy flight without the option of lying him down in a bassinet where he would be able to get some sleep and I'm sure is would also have been beneficial to other travellers on the flight. So disappointed.

London Gatwick to Antalya - like most of the reviews on this forum my expectations were not high but it is clear that the airline have cut their product to the minimum and are not really interested in the overall customer experience. The aircraft are now configured to the maximum capacity which means that seat pitch is virtually the smallest in the industry. When will Thomas Cook wake up to the fact that this damaging their brand. If you are flying customers off to four and five star hotels the last thing they want is to start their holiday in a manner that resembles a cattle truck. Think about your product and other reviews on this site and start making improvements before it is too late.

Once again Thomas Cook has proven themselves to be little more than extortionists. The last two times I have booked a holiday with them I have attempted to use their online check in almost 48 hours prior to my flight and each time it has shown me an empty plane with sufficient seats to be had and yet from the outset we are placed in adjoining seats on both sides of an aisle while a prompt asks if you would like to pay extra to move to seats that are next to each other. You can't even move just one seat next to the other as it charges you double as if you had moved them both! Last time this happened I decided to wait and check in at the airport just to see if they had since allocated those seats to someone else and given us new ones but no they had specifically allocated the same ones to us from the outset even though the plane was empty at that time still. I have just gone through the same process and once again they have placed me and my husband on two sides of an aisle. This company can claim all it likes that it attempts to sit people together when possible but the fact remains they are now deliberately carrying out this practise so that people are forced to pay extra for holidays they have already paid for. This will be the last holiday or cruise I will book through this company until they become more honest in their dealings will their passengers.

We flew from Glasgow to Antalya on 18th September. I wish we hadn't. The cramped seats were expected the lack of any interesting entertainment likewise. So we'd taken books and we'd booked the James Martin inspired meal thinking this would keep us occupied throughout the four and a half hour trip. How naive of us! Screaming crying shrieking and general shouting and bawling were the order of the day. And then there were the kids. Most of our fellow travellers seemed to have to bellow at each other in order to be heard. Well it was either that or sign language. The steward who made the intercom announcements on the plane clearly felt the need to jolly us into enjoying the initial stage of our holiday - he repeatedly addressed us as 'Ladies and gentlemen boys and girls' in a Hi de Hi 'aren't we having fun' tone of (loud) voice admittedly the only way anything could be heard above the screaming but it did make us feel a little like breaking into a rousing rendition of 'Didn't we have a luvverly time the day we went to Bangor'. Reading? I don't think so. During the very few lulls in the general pandemonium a few of us tried to escape from the carnage by burying ourselves in a chapter or two. Only to be rudely wrenched away by yet another piercing scream from a child (or adult) demanding something else. I've never been so glad to touch down and disembark. Still look on the bright side - we've definitely learned something. None of us will ever fly with Thomas Cook airlines again!

Flew return flights between Glasgow and Dalaman Turkey. We booked extra legroom seats both ways. There was a lot of space but in reality we paid £25 per seat each way only to provide a stopping place for passengers waiting to get into the toilet. On the flight out the cabin crew actually parked the service trolley in the leg room space and set up a little "stall" to sell their duty free. We were trodden on many times and at one point when the crew left the trolley for a few minutes to deliver some duty free the heavy trolley started to slide towards our legs! A stewardess just managed to catch it in time. On the way back someone was sitting in my (£25) seat! It's a row of 3 seats the middle and aisle are Extra Legroom the window seat isn't as it's partially blocked by the plastic container which houses the emergency evacuation shute. The nearby stewardess simply pointed us towards the available seats - one of which was the cramped window seat. Long story short we eventually got the seats we'd booked. But it turned out that we were the only schmucks who'd paid for the extra space. The other 4 people had been allocated these seats on check in free of charge. We'll never fly Thomas Cook again.

Holiday to Skiathos returning 12th September to East Midlands. The outbound flight was acceptable but the return flight gave a new meaning to cattle class. We were in very cramped seats my table was broken and the ingrained dirt on the hinges was disgusting. I reported the broken table to one of the cabin crew and was advised to use the table of the empty seat next to me - not sure what would have happened had the seat been occupied. I had to speak to this steward again and he made it more than clear that I was being annoying - he persistently called me "love" in less than endearing terms. What needs to be remembered is that we have paid a lot of money for the holiday - £1000 of which was for the travel alone and actually deserve a little more respect. I would challenge the CEO to travel as we have done and be satisfied with the experience. Anyway we are returning to Skiathos next year and have already booked flights on BA at a fifth of the price of this years travel cost. I think Thomas Cook need to improve drastically before we use them again.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
Flew from Manchester to Tenerife paid for pre booked seats both ways but outbound and inbound aircraft changed so seats were a free for all at check in. Cabin crew were surly and only interested in getting as much food drink and duty free sold as possible. One was actually eating off the top of the cart as they did drinks service whilst another was overheard to say to a passenger asking for something for his toddler 'I can't I have to do a duty free service ask later'. Seats were cramped and fixed upright. Entertainment on inbound failed but only after they had sold the headphones. Inflight meal was standard but narrowness of the seat coupled with the obese woman next to me literally required me to eat the whole thing one handed. Overall a clear example of 'cattle class' I would rather holiday at home than subject myself and my family to such a poor unprofessional service again.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
We booked a two week package in Turkey through an agent with Thomas Cook (TC). Although the flights were managed by TC they contracted them out to Pegasus Airlines a Turkish low cost airline. Having read a variety of reviews about Pegasus we didn't know what to expect. You don't get the same pre-flight facilities as with TC such as online check-in extra payment for extra legroom seats or an early bag drop the evening before. These facilities are available with direct bookings with Pegasus. Some reviewers have commented on the poor condition of aircraft but we flew B737-800 in good condition each way. We found the staff to be friendly and courteous but we had few dealings with them as everything onboard even water has to be paid for. There is no entertainment only drop down screens showing flight progress and data. The outbound flight was OK but the return form Bodrum was a nightmare. Having been collected from our hotel at 0145 the first of five stops we went to check in. Only one desk was open then more staff arrived at 0400. At the scheduled departure time of 0600 we were told of a 30m delay due to a technical fault on the aircraft then 1h 30m at 0630. At 0730 the delay became 6h later extended to 10h. The situation then descended into chaos. Our only source of information was the airport departures board until a TC airport rep. appeared. He announced (to those that could hear him) that we would go through immigration to have our passport exit stamps cancelled collect our luggage then be coached to a local hotel. More queuing and waiting and we eventually got to the hotel. Before we had time to eat an update said that we would return to the airport at 1230 for a 1500 departure. That was changed to a 1200 collection for a 1530 flight. Back at the airport we had more queues for the first security check before check in then passports and another security check. We finally left ten hours late on a replacement aircraft. That was better than what we were told at one time that we might not leave until the next day. Whilst the TC airport rep. tried his best the situation was chaotic. A Turkish TC guide helped to translate and transmit messages but not everyone could hear what was being said so they had to ask others what was happening. There was no offer of refreshments at the airport and most people had already spent their Euros or Turkish Lire. Once airborne the flight was a copy of the outbound. A free meal or snack onboard would haven an appropriate gesture but was not provided. We had not eaten a meal since dinner the evening before. We will never book a TC package again that uses Pegasus and will certainly think carefully before booking a TC package at all. They don't deserve repeat custom.

Flew Gatwick to Dalaman and back. Worst flying experience ever given wrong information before the flight so took baggage to drop off evening before flight to be told not possible so had to drag it all back to the hotel no management at all on ground at Gatwick spoke to an agent acting for the airline who said she would go and get information after an hours wait she had still not returned so gave up. Witnessed many other disgruntled passengers all having their hand luggage weighed and charged excess if more than 5 kgs (small bag with SLR camera plus iPad not far off 5kgs before anything else packed) Paid extra for extra legroom seats very uncomfortable flight crew appeared very unhappy with no interest in passengers needs or comfort to crown it all over 2 hour wait for luggage on return to Gatwick.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
Booked a single flight from Antalya back to Gatwick as we'd been travelling around in Turkey. After the initial confusion when checking in of finding out that there was no luggage included in the ticket price the remainder of check was quite smooth right through to getting to the gate. Once at the gate their system if in fact they have one fell apart. Despite seats being allocated it was a virtual bun-fight to get on the plane. This would appear to be seasoned Thomas Cook travelers (poor souls) knowing that there is inadequate hand luggage storage particularly when nearly everyone has at least 2 bags and duty free. At 6ft tall I don't expect leg room to be huge on this type of airline but my goodness the pitch on these seats was tiny. Almost instantly the domino effect of reclining seats forced everyone to attempt to regain the lost 3 inches of space to avoid chewing on the seat in front for the whole journey. Loading passengers on had been left so late that we were moving before everyone was settled. A half-hearted attempt to carry out a safety demonstration was totally ignored. Then during the thorough (lack lustre) inspection by cabin crew the couple in front of us were calling their friends during take-off whilst a man opposite watched a film on his laptop. However the cabin crew seemed a lot more on the ball in their attempts to sell us headphone adapters so we could watch the film on the roof mounted screen which was about 15 feet away. Whilst I am not expecting to get the level of service from a larger airline this was without doubt the worst flying experience of my life. Other "budget" airlines have massively upped their game and unless Thomas Cook follow suit they can't hope to keep any customers. Now wishing I could have stayed a little longer and flown home with Turkish Airlines who set the bar so much higher taking us out there.

Flew to Dalaman Turkey flights were on time pleasant crew captain was informative. Food very good would have no problem flying with Thomas Cook again. Only negative was the low baggage allowance compared to other airlines.

STN-MAH-STN first time on a charter airline for a couple of years and can see why. We were on an airbus A321 and talk about claustrophobic! the back of the seat in front of you was practically in your face and you didn't even have the room to read a tabloid newspaper! Mercifully it was only a two hour flight and flew by so to speak. Crew out were very good and on the way back the same if some what over familiar with certain passengers. Ok for a short hop but would not be happy with anything over two hours.

Gatwick-Kalamata return on B757. Both flights full and on time. Crew very good. Seat pitch a bit tight as are all charter flights. This was compensated by the seats having a very small recline cutting out the seatback in your face as soon as the wheels are up situation. We took our own food and drink so no requirement to purchase on board. These flights were part of a villa package so no choice off carrier but compared very well with other charter airlines we have flown with.

Just returned from a trip to Dalaman Turkey. This is the first time I've travelled with Thomas Cook Airlines. The staff were helpful and friendly and the service was excellent. The captain kept us informed throughout the journey. Check-in and loading were very quick and efficient. The seats were a bit narrow and not masses of leg room but satisfactory for a 4 hour flight - on a 757. Will certainly book with Thomas Cook Airlines again.

TCX 412 from Gatwick to Cancun on 4th September 2014 and return flight was TCX 413 from Cancun to Gatwick on 18th September 2014. We flew 4th September premium upgrade and were very disappointed. We have flown with First Choice and Thomson for years and have upgraded to premium every time. You get treated really well priority boarding inflight drinks free headphones pre-flight drink whilst waiting for the plane to takeoff newspapers and a whole lot more. I was not aware that with Thomas Cook you only get a wider seat and extra leg room which is a disgrace and I will not fly with them again!

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
Booked a package holiday and flew from London Gatwick to Zakynthos (Zante). The flight out was good friendly staff but no entertainment. No reps to greet us at the airport. The flight back to Gatwick was a different story. At Zante airport an announcement came over the tannoy saying that all those in seat rows 1 to 29 to board at the front of the plane and the rest to the back of the plane. We were in row 29 therefore obviously we would board at the front of the plane. When we walked in to the plane we got greeted by an unhappy air hostess who told me off for boarding the wrong end of the plane even though this was what we were told. This made us feel very unwelcome onboard. After take off we waited a very long time before drinks and snacks were bought round. They then said we could all fill out a questionnaire regarding Thomas Cook. The air hostess started distributing these but when she got to about row 28 she just walked straight past and ignored the fact that I would have liked to complete one. She seemed stressed and far from happy and lacked customer service. I asked one of the other air hostess's if I could have a questionnaire to complete and she was more than happy to get me one and apologised. The unhappy air hostess then came round collecting rubbish but once again missed us out so we sat for the rest of the trip with cups and wrappers on our tables. There was definitely very much a lack of customer service and polite attitude from one of the air hostesses which you don't really expect when you are a customer. I appreciate everyone has an off day but you still have to be polite to others especially in this kind of work.

Flew from Manchester to Cancun. Great flight with really nice meal. Cabin crew were very friendly and helpful. Their job was not helped by a passenger who thought he would be the "hard man" and start swearing over something insignificant. Well done to the girl for keeping her cool. Seat width is a bit tight but who cares the end destination is the goal - just put up with the flight!

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
My family and I flew from Manchester on TCX472 on the 2nd of August with Thomas Cook to Orlando MCO for the first time. We've previously flown to the same location with Virgin. We tried booking with them again but the price had really increased from the last time we flew in 2011. Thomas Cooks price was practically the same as I paid in 2011 even with two of us having extra legroom as an option! OK the TC price didn't include food and entertainment but even taking that into account we still were £500 better off. I did worry a little when I looked at the mixed reviews. I've only flown the premier carriers before like BA and Virgin so expected the worse! I needn't have! Despite airport security being really bad at each ends the flight in between was really good. The reviews go on about the seats being hard and cramped but I found them acceptable. I'm a big guy and I coped. Sitting down in most seats for over 9 hours is uncomfortable. My family sat in the standard seats and my brother and I sat in ones with extra legroom. After our last time to MCO on a Virgin jumbo we thought the idea of alternating was worth the extra money but nobody needed to move they found the standard legroom ok. The flight crew were excellent. They were attentive and very approachable. I noticed that one of the stewardesses made a real effort to keep the families with little children comfortable which made all the difference. They also came around regularly and took away rubbish. Last time I flew to Orlando with Virgin I literally had to wade through empty bottles papers and magazines to get off! We opted not to have the food because to be frank I don't like eating with knives and forks in cramped conditions so bought sandwiches and drinks at the airport. The entertainment was ok even though you have to pay for the head sets and movies! The highlight of the trip was when we landed at Orlando. We spent 100 minutes going through US immigration but I felt sorry for the Virgin passengers who were behind us! Nice one Thomas Cook! All in all I would rank them better value for money than Virgin based on my trip. We will fly with them again!

I travelled late August 2014 on Flight TCX 724 Manchester to Las Vegas and was apprehensive about the flight having read no many negative reviews beforehand. It seems to me that your luck is down to the aircraft you fly on. The Premium cabin extra legroom is definitely worth it as we travelled back with Virgin en Economy which was far worse. All the complaints seem to be petty (films on loops no free drinks person in front reclined seat). We really enjoyed the flight and glad I did my research before hand and was prepared with my own drinks and my own films on tablet. Not difficult really. Food was excellent but I'm sure James Martin did not prepare it himself as it seems some of the reviewers wanted! Cabin crew where helpful and polite and no different to Virgin Staff. Word of warning on hand luggage - 6 Kgs only so make use of the 23 Kgs in the hold. Overall I say "hats off" to Thomas Cook for offering an alternative to Virgin with no frills and making everything very clear on their website including the information on cost for drinks. I will certainly be paying half price compared to Virgin and fly with TC again. I understand that next year the food will be included in the ticket price and some beverages. I just hope they don't hike the prices up!

We flew from ARN-AYT and back this was Thomas Cook Scandinavia airlines it was an A330 very hard seats no flight entertainment just some poor movie on the ceiling screens. However we liked the food and the staff service was really nice they were so friendly.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
Booked holiday to Vegas in January 2014. Specifically requested at Thomas Cook travel agents that we wanted to fly with Virgin. Told by the agent who handled our booking that Virgin no longer flew Manchester to Vegas but that Thomas Cook was "just as good". This is incorrect. Virgin DO fly Manchester/Vegas which unfortunately we only found out just before we departed for Vegas. We paid for upgraded premium seats. Wish we hadn't bothered. James Martin food was okay. Seats shabby and not particularly comfortable especially on a 10 hour plus flight. In-flight TV/video poor to say the least. Bad selection of videos (unless re-runs of George and Mildred are your thing). To say we are unhappy is an understatement. Will never book through or fly with TC again.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
Flew Dalaman to Gatwick Well I say flew I felt more like I was the piston in an engine being rammed into the tiny space they call a seat. I believe Thomas Cook have come across a material harder than diamond and they make their seats out of it; comfort is something you'll definitely be sacrificing if you choose to use this airline. You'll also find the cabin crew are more interested in attempting to solicit money from your wallet for scratch cards and other 'duty free' products at 600% RRP. If you weigh anything more than 4 stone or you're taller than a garden gnome I'd avoid travelling with Thomas Cook that is unless your intention is to become a paraplegic. Why their seats still recline I've no idea I made the unfortunate choice of booking the seats behind the extra leg room seats as I'd missed out on the extra leg room ones. The giant who sat in front of me immediately reclined his seat back into what was left of my knee caps once we'd taken off. So I had to put my knees either side of his seat leading to much discomfort. I will never make the mistake of flying Thomas Cook again.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
Having read so many negative comments on various websites about how awful Thos Cook Airlines are I thought it only right to compliment them on a superb return flight from Gatwick to Antalya. Cabin crew were excellent. Food superb. Seats comfortable. And both flights on time. I have flown with a number of different airlines. My first time flying with Thos Cook and nothing but praise.

Flew Thomas Cook from Glasgow to Lanzarote 14/8/14 to 21/8/14. After reading some reviews I was a bit worried but shouldn't have been. No real issue at all. Flight out was a little late but nothing major. Plane was clean and cabin crew very polite. I'm 6'3 so was worried about leg room in a Standard seat but although not great I was by no means uncomfortable. I got up to stretch my legs twice and I was fine. The meals were great. Either Beef or Chicken both lovely and Pasta as a kids meal which my son loved. On the return we were on time and made up 30 minutes coming home. This was a night flight and I was told Thomas Cook no longer do blankets on board. All money saving I suppose. Again the meals home were great. A Chicken Curry or Beef in Red Wine sauce. I ate my sons meal of Chicken Strips as he was asleep best out the three. Thomas Cook are all about money. Everything costs. Food and drink is not cheap but you have the option of buying in the airport so I don't know why people complain so much as they know what to expect. Headsets headphone adapters etc it all costs but what do you expect? I don't understand anyone who would book through a low costs holiday firm and expect everything to be handed out free. Cheap airlines charging for these things is not new. If you want it all free book a Virgin airline but I bet it will cost you more for the flight overall with them. My only issue is that we did not have Thomas Cook representative on our transfer to the hotel. Simply told which stop to get off. The only negative aspect of the experience.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
Flew Manchester to Orlando International late July. Have travelled many times with Thomas Cook and have always been satisfied. We booked the rear seats of the plane which have a larger aisle space and not as cramped. The seat pitch is more than Virgin and BA  newly refitted planes with good seat back TV's. Excellent cabin crew on both outbound/inbound flights meals good. Will fly again with them again.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
Having read all the reviews I was a little apprehensive about flying with Thomas Cook to Cuba this month. However I had nothing to worry about. We flew Premium and it was well worth the money - plenty of space leg room and the extra seat recline was perfect. Both the outbound and return flights were on time and a pillow and blanket was provided for the return which was an overnight flight. The staff were excellent - very friendly polite and professional. We had to divert to Bermuda on the return as a passenger took ill and the staff remained calm were very supportive and the captain kept us all informed of what was happening. The food was good and better than some other airlines I've flown. In summary I wouldn't hesitate to flying premium economy with Thomas Cook long haul again.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
Flew out from Gatwick to Tenerife South on 16th August 2014 check in wasn't too bad and the plane was quite modern. TC's seat configuration on there 757's can make leg room very tight and squashed. There was TV's on this plane. They played a decent movie and programmes but the TV was so small and the picture quality was so bad it was very difficult to watch. Landed earlier than scheduled. Baggage claim took forever. After a 10 day holiday in Tenerife we flew black on 26th August 2014. This flight was definitely not as good as the one out. As we boarded the plane we were greeted by extremely rude staff who told us the seats that we had reserved and paid extra money for had to be given to someone else on medical terms which I understand but not only did they give us bad seats they also split us up. We were all given extra leg room seats but one of them was away from the family while the rest of us had to sit in the extra leg room seats next to the toilet and the place where they prepare their disgusting onboard food. The very rude staff who had no concern for passenger welfare thought giving us a free drink each would make up for this which it did not. There was no TV on this flight because it was 10 mins shorter than the one going out. I was very relived when we landed early at Gatwick. Because of this incident I don't think I'll fly with Thomas Cook again Easyjet Thomson or Monarch would be better options.

I flew with Thomas Cook for my holiday to Corfu which was a 2 hour 45 minute flight so not too bad. Now being 6ft 1 which is over average height for a girl I knew that I would be a little uncomfortable with legroom so I wasn't expecting anything amazing but I was expecting a little more than what I got. I literally had my knees pressed so hard against the seat in front I couldn't move at all once I had sat down and had to rest them across my mothers lap because sticking them out in the aisle meant I was in everyone's way. I understand Economy doesn't have masses of leg room but this is ridiculous. This had the least leg room of all the companies planes I have been on and I have been in a 757 before so I know that there is more room for legs than that. The staff however were lovely. The nicest people ever they were the only thing that made the trip bearable!

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
We flew the beginning of last year to Austria from Manchester. Flight was great but for long haul flights would not use them as last summer we went to Mexico and on the way back just as we got to sleep lights went on for them to sell drinks. Why do they do this on night flights. They should have a designated area where people can purchase drinks rather than waking everyone up every hour.

Flew 5th Aug Newcastle to Turkey the plane was horrendous seats didn't even recline my husband and I were squashed in our seats with the tray down could hardly move arms to eat the food - and we are average build god help the really overweight people. The food was disgusting I can't believe James Martin puts his name to this both ways we were given breakfast a tomato that had disintegrated scrambled tasteless egg stringy bacon and an ok sausage. I will never pay for airline meals again after this experience. On return we paid £17.50 each for extra leg room at check in given our boarding passes then told to go and pay elsewhere. Went to pay to be told Thomas Cook don't accept payment by card! We had no cash so my husband had to go back out of the airport to go to cash-point then had to come back through all security again had to wait in horrendous queues too. Terrible service and I doubt very much I will travel with Thomas Cook again!

We flew from Birmingham to Turkey and returned 10 days later. On the way out headphones and starbucks coffee had not been put onboard. As a coffee drinker I was disappointed but would have accepted the coffee that goes with the meal if offered but nothing was suggested as an alternative. To help people with infight entertainment without headphones they decided to play the family movie but you could barely see it and it was so quiet it was a pointless attempt to please people. The flights/planes overall are dated and uncomfortable. My husband is over 6ft and we travel with three children making it difficult to get extra leg room seats which are often fully booked. The leg room is so poor that you feel that you can't recline your seat which is difficult when flying over night and everyone is tired. The staff overall were pleasant but not overly helpful just doing their jobs. I've flown many times and this was one of the worst companies I've flown with.

Booked with James Villas flights included on receipt of e-ticket nothing advising you to check in online prior to arriving at airport started my holiday eleven rows behind my husband. I am a nervous flyer and found this distressing. On return flight from Fuerteventura we were called to the gate and then left standing for over half an hour with no explanation as to why eventually boarded the plane I am 5'4 I had the seat in front of me right up against my knees but not as bad as later when seatbelt sign went off. The chap in front reclined his seat which came back so far my knees were crushed I couldn't have eaten a meal if I'd wanted to as the tray couldn't come down. If I had needed to get my lifejacket from under the seat I would have drowned as this would have been physically impossible to do. I feel as a paying customer we are not getting the service deserved and will endeavour never to fly with this airline again.

My partner and I travelled from MAN to Punta Cana 19/7/14. We flew economy outbound and the flight itself was good very smooth and on time and the service was avarage. The entertainment was very poor with limited film selection no musi cand just some old radio recordings. On our return flight we were offered a flight upgrade for £100 which I thought was good value for money and the seat pitch is bigger but this is where the premium upgrade ends. You have to pay for earphones and the poor entertainment is exactly the same no free drinks and same food menu. If you think that paying for a slightly larger seat is worth the money that is fine but Thomas Cook should not advertise this as a premium service.

Flew from Manchester to Kalamata Greece on 20/7/14 and return a week later. Booked extra leg seats on row 31 for the three of us. Both flights were on 767-300 aircraft and were excellent. Both on time. Comfortable (I'm a big boned 6'3") and the food was absolutely fine they even got my gluten free option right on both flights without being prompted. Cabin crew were professional and helpful both flights. I am really pleased to be able to redress the balance here because to be honest with all the negativity on some of the reviews here we had some trepidation about our holiday flight which proved totally unfounded.

Manchester to Las Vegas 11 July. Paid extra for premium cabin thinking it would be a superior service with superior seats - how wrong I was. The seats although slightly wider than economy didn't have a great deal extra leg room and were so old that they has no padding in them. I don't think the cabin had been refurbished since the aircraft was new. It was very shabby the monitor in the seat back was scratched and the quality of the picture was poor. Outbound the crew were very pleasant - not so on the return - the senior crew member spoke to a passenger in front of others in a disgusting manner - a quiet word would have sufficed. The food by James Martin to be fair was very good - if only it had not been overcooked and dried out. We arrived in Vegas and although our bags were labelled 'priority' they didn't arrive first and on the way back they weren't labelled 'priority' and arrived 40 minutes after landing. On our return from Vegas - no priority boarding until somebody complained Basically you receive nothing extra apart from slightly wider seats for paying the extra to upgrade. Not cheap and very poor - next time will travel Virgin - even their economy service is better than this.

Having booked a package from Glasgow to Orlando and later reading reviews about the flight I was slightly nervous re what to expect. However we found the flights and service excellent. My son decided at the last minute that he didn't want to get on the plane and I have to say the airlines staff were fantastic (not the gate staff though). Not only did they help get him on the plane they reassured me had a special announcement made for him and when the flight was in the air the pilot came out to see how he was. Glad to say he was fine once we were in the air! The meals were all included in our package so we just had to buy drinks. I was ok with this given to fly with Virgin with drinks included was an extra £2000! The meals were really nice and the flight was on time. Inflight entertainment was ok-I have seen better but this would not stop me flying with them again.

1 Aug 2014 night flight from Birmingham to Burgas Bulgaria. I regularly fly across Europe and this was the worst flight I have experienced. The airplane departure was delayed due to a small "technical fault" but no further information was forthcoming. Although I paid £10 to choose my seat it was very cramped with no leg room (I am 5'5"). The cabin crew were surly to the point of being rude the "meal" was a disgrace which I'm glad I didn't have: the passenger next to me paid £8.50 for a single small serving of a very basic meal with no dessert or any other accompaniment and a tea or coffee. The seat was lumpy and very uncomfortable and had not been cleaned. I am aware that this was the cheapest flight for the date I travelled but I do expect a basic level of care to be met. This most certainly did not!

Flew Thomas Cook from Glasgow to Antalya and back and I have to say the flights were disappointing. The seats were okay but the leg room was a disgrace. It was a night time flight back and I found difficult to sleep as my legs kept cramping up. The cabin crew were friendly and helpful but the food wasn't great. The inflight film Fast & Furious didn't get finished and was constantly interrupted. In conclusion I would not recommend Thomas Cook Airlines.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
Used this airline Manchester to Orlando as 10 members of same family were travelling together and this was the only option. In hindsight we would have rather split up to different airlines than use Thomas Cook. The only part of the flight that I can say was excellent was the leg room. Everything else from the agony of the rock hard seats the miserable staff having to pay for everything onboard (even a cup of tea or coffee) to the paltry entertainment package was shocking and below standard. This was a scheduled flight and not a package and on the 20+ transatlantic flights we have had I have never paid for drinks - this was a first. You get a few items to watch on the screen nothing to get exited about but if you want more films or a better content yes you've guessed it you pay extra. You even have to pay £20/person extra for the meals. There is no individual air con and the aircraft was so warm all the way back. I mentioned it to the cabin staff but was totally ignored. I would say that this is the EasyJet or Ryanair airline of the transatlantic route.

I recently travelled to Cuba in a group of 32 - although all booked at same time our seats were throughout the plane both times - I was told each time I could get a special meal - none available. On flight home stewardess was rude when asked if I could have the child's meal as no snacks available at Cuba airport to take on board - she then blanked me for rest of journey. Drinks and food expensive - lights would not go out on home flight - overnight which meant - arrived exhausted and hungry.

My daughter and I just came back from Djerba Tunisia. We had booked an all inclusive holiday thinking it would be easier and stress free for once. How wrong can you be! We arrived at Gatwick on 11th July at 3pm for a flight due to leave at 5.20pm to be told at check-in that it was delayed by over 6 hours! We were given £15 each towards food and drink and as everybody will know that didn't go very far at the airport. On the plane they tried to convince us to buy bottles of water telling us it would be too late to get anything from the hotel - this was not the case. We finally got to our hotel room around 4 in the morning. The Rep wasn't particularly apologetic for the delay. On departure day 18th July we were picked up at 6.55pm and told our flight was delayed by an hour. This seemed ok after the dreadful start the week before. We got to the airport was left in a queue by the Rep who wished us all a good trip back. After around an hour in the queue without much happening somebody came back to say that our flight was now delayed until the next afternoon. The Rep should have known this and not taken us away from the hotel. At this point it was chaos the Rep didn't reappear until around 9.15pm and despite everyone asking him for information he didn't seem to know much and was very slow to sort transport back to the hotel. We finally made it to our hotel around 10.40pm nearly 4 hours after leaving for no reason. We were picked up again to go to the airport for a second time at 10am the next morning and the flight was delayed even more - instead of leaving at 1.10pm we finally took off at 2.50pm. The plane itself seemed to be very old the seats were uncomfortable with no leg room. While on the tarmac water was dripping from the ceiling due to the heat outside apparently! On arrival rows 1-10 were asked to stay seated as the plane might tip forward if everyone get up at the same time. The staff on the plane tried their best to be helpful but I would never fly with Thomas Cook airlines and I will never again book a holiday with Thomas Cook.

TCX718 Manchester to Orlando 9th July 2014 on A330 G-MLJL. We were a party of five all booked in economy we decided before hand to book our seats online as the extra cost allowed us to be guaranteed seats together. We boarded on time but were delayed "on stand" for around thirty minutes no explanation of this slight delay was given however our flight still arrived early at Orlando but more on this later. The aircraft itself was quite old and the cabin was tired and in need of renovation. We were sitting in row 12 and seat 12G would not stay in the upright position we asked a member of the cabin crew if they could help in any way and two of our party were upgraded to premium economy straight away. The seat pitch in economy was fine with plenty of leg room but they were not very wide with no room at all for movement. The entertainment selection was good but the system is dated and not all screens and audio outlets worked correctly with some not working at all. The flight crew were professional polite and attentive. They did not try to sell us things other than the normal duty free stuff. The food was prepared well and was a little better than average but not to the taste of everyone in the party so the pre packed sandwiches came in handy. Orlando airport were not prepared for our arrival and were late connection the air ridge to the aircraft and they did not unlock the door at the exit point prior to letting passengers off the aircraft. We would use this airline again but the aircraft would need to be refurbished.

Flew on June 4th from Manchester to Tunisia on a 767 had to say was impressed with new design seats which offer much more leg room (I'm 6'2"). Meals delicious and entertainment was good. Pre-booked seats and used fast track at security in Manchester. Overall a very pleasant experience.

Arrived at Gatwick at 02.30 we waited around at the check-in desks for about half an hour put our bags through and showed the man our passports he told us our flight was delayed until 10.4. After an agonising 6 hours we were allowed to go to the gates this was an experience in itself! We arrived at the gates and there were people everywhere. The women at the desk were so rude and were not giving us any information whatsoever. 40 minutes later we finally boarded the plane. The plane had flown in from Switzerland so we were unable to understand the crew pilot safety sheets catalogues I believe 2 members of Thomas Cook staff were on board. Arriving at the airport the other side - easy! Arriving back at the airport the other end the boarding gate on our ticket was different to the gate we were supposed to be at. We had to run to our gate typically it was over the other side of the airport! We boarded the plane no problem but had another delay and sat on the runway for an hour in the boiling hot weather. To this day we've had no apology.

Flew from Glasgow to Turkey and paid £10 to have bags off plane first but they were last so claiming that money back! On return flight the aircraft had cold air blasting in and passengers were really cold. One of the flight attendants were walking past me and when I said "excuse me" to catch her attention she stopped walking with a look on her face and turned with almost a sarcastic smile as if I was bothering her when all I wanted to ask was if I could have a blanket as me and my son were cold - but she said they don't carry blankets. Not really a brilliant service to be honest.

Flew Manchester to Las Vegas in June 2014. I paid extra for premium economy to have that extra bit of room. Premium is quite expensive for saying you don't get food or drinks included (I booked the flight only not a package and they charge you £44 if you want meals for 2 people). The flight itself was OK but the entertainment was bad - the films were rubbish and on a continuous loop. The films advertised on the inbound flight had been changed. It seemed that many people that had booked premium hadn't been told by their travel agent that drinks weren't included. The cabin crew going out were really good and friendly but the crew on the inbound flight were just rude and miserable. We checked in the night before at Manchester and had to pay £5 each I think if you're paying the extra for premium you shouldn't have to pay for this. Drinks and food should also be included. We flew with Thomas Cook a few years ago when premium actually meant premium and it was a lot better then.

Disgusting service. Had a 9.5 hour flight to UK from Vegas and were given one glass of water complimentary for the whole duration. Everything else you had to pay for unless you had booked a package holiday which included food and drinks. Staff were extremely rude and incompetent. My boyfriend and I were given seats miles apart. When we questioned this at the gate we were told there were no other seats and there was nothing they could do (even after I had told them how difficult I find flying alone). The lady said they had seated us as close as possible but when we got on the flight there was a row completely empty which we eventually got moved to when we asked again. Entertainment system was broken for most of our flight and when it did work it the quality was awful. Seats were uncomfy the blankets and pillows smelt horrible and there was dirt down the side of the wall. We were charged to use headphones adapters and even our credit card. Next time I will pay the extra flight money for some decent service.

Flew direct to Las Vegas from Manchester 20/6/14. Flight slightly delayed but even after due departure time the board stated "on time". On long haul flights cabin gets cold so on any other airline pillows and blankets supplied as standard but they only seemed to have a dozen which were all claimed before take off leaving some people cold for 10+hr flight. Charge for head sets to use their entertainment system and can't really use your own as requires a 2 pin adapter! Drinks overly priced (which I didn't know weren't included) meal standard plane stuff. Just seemed to want money from you at all times be it duty free scratch cards drinks food headsets charity bag etc. Now I know I was going to Las Vegas but this is my 11th trip there but 1st time with Thomas Cook and I've never had this type of experience before but flight was full of noisy drunken stag groups who hadn't booked seats together so were gathered in groups in the aisles personally I felt the cabin crew should have refused alcohol to some they were that drunk but they didn't because they just want money from you. Return flight pretty much the same except blankets were provided to everyone and stag groups had worn themselves out so most we're sleeping so was much quieter.

Manchester to Dominican Republic and return. We recently visited the Dominican Republic for a 2 week all inclusive holiday. The holiday was great. The flight seats and leg room were adequate. However the food was dreadful. James Martin should be dismissed! I requested a special dietary meal gluten free because I have coeliac disease. Gluten free food is not particularly nice as its quite dry so care has to be taken to choose something appealing. I was given a fairly decent hot meal on the outbound journey but why oh why does James think we just want fruit as a dessert when everyone else was getting a very nice sponge type dessert? The 'breakfast' later in the flight consisted of a yoghurt and a piece of fruit. There was a bread roll but it was very dry and very brown. The return journey was no better but because the flight attendants didn't get the food out quick enough my very dry rice and extremely dry chicken was too awful to eat. I had the obligatory piece of fruit for dessert and then the breakfast was the same as on the outbound flight.

Manchester to Heraklion Crete and back. Heraklion is not a comfortable airport and you will be lucky to find seats in the waiting area. One poor old woman was sick while she was waiting and nobody came to clean it up in the remaining time I waited before boarding (about 20 minutes). I had paid an extra £34 for seats with more leg room on the return journey. It was a flight arriving about 12.30am (which would equate to 2.30am Greek time that we would be accustomed to). I was working the next day and hoped to get some sleep. I might as well have saved my money as the seats were the most uncomfortable I have ever been in. They were almost vertical and offered no option to recline. The staff did their job - no friendly smiles or comments. The pilot sounded like he may have some interesting comments on the journey but we couldn't make out what he was saying. We love Crete but would avoid this airline if at all possible.

TCX 1052/53 from Gatwick to Enfidha on TC A320 - seats were alright not much legroom but it was adequate if you sit in the first two rows be aware you will not have an overhead bin. The overhead bin is used for safety equipment and you can't put it under your seat as some one else has already put theirs there! No inflight entertainment cabin crew were extremely rude on the way back the crew refused to put this lady's sick bag in the bin because apparently it is again health and safety law? Me being the nice person I am I went and put it in the bin in the toilet for her as she had a broken leg and was unable to do this herself. I gave a glare to the cabin crew only to receive a tut from them. Food was ok but not worth paying for. Highlight of the flight was when we landed back at Gatwick the cabin crew said the usual 'thank you for flying Thomas Cook we hope to see you again in the future' and then everyone in the plane shouted together 'As If.

The plane was pre-historic. I travelled from Gatwick to Cancun. The seats torn worn with grubby food down the sides of them. Made to pay £2.75 for a headset when the entertainment system did not work for 10.5 entire hours and for this one measly complimentary drink was offered! The staff were rude and when I asked for a glass of water I was told to go to the back and help myself. The aircraft felt like Antarctica and when I was given a blanket after an hour it was covered in hair. I struggle to understand an entertainment system that works with 8mm tapes as we are in 2014 and one where the films start every two hour. The service given by the staff is appalling. I will never fly with Thomas Cook.

We flew LGW-HOG Cuba. The A330-200 chartered was pretty shameful to be honest. The easiest way to describe Thomas cook is a long haul Ryanair. Beverages and snacks onboard are outrageously overpriced (2 small beers at £8) and the crew as miserable as possible. IFE on a loop with 2 films and a couple of TV shows. The cleanest aspect of the aircraft was the toilets. On a good note legroom pretty plentiful. Premium cabin only had another 2" of leg room at 38". All food beverages and headsets are not included in the premium cabin price.

My experience was terrible with Thomas Cook. We were flying to Las Vegas which on the way there is a 10.5 hr flight. The entertainment system wasn't working on the way there and I tell you it is not easy to entertain yourself for that long on a plane. They hand out what can only be described as a few pieces of tracing paper as a pillow so comfort obviously is there main concern. The flight attendants were clearly stressed as you can imagine their job will get harder with a plane full people with nothing to do but tried their best. On the way back only 3 channels on the entertainment system had sound. As well as the same comfort problems as on the way there the flight attendants where very rude and not interested in doing there job. One lady asked for some water and was told to get it herself which is when my jaw hit the floor. overall it was terrible they should stick to short haul or make big changes.

Arrived at Luton airport for our 07.00 flight to Zakynthos at 04.45 to find all Monarch flights which were being used by Manos/Thomas Cook to fly us to Zakynthos had only 4 check ins open for all flights to all destinations. It took over 3 hours for us to check our bags in and thus our flight was over an hour late departing. When we arrived at Zakynthos one of our bags was missing. We were told our luggage was still at Luton and would be flown out the next day. The Thomas Cook rep told me it had been sent to Amsterdam and would arrive later that day. After waiting for the luggage to arrive and it not being on the flight I again was abruptly told it had been flown to Athens. The bag did finally arrive that night but our first 3 days of holiday was ruined by waiting around so many times after being given false information.

TCX 6536/7 28/5/14 and 4/6/14. Superb! Had the pleasure of a brand new A321 from Newcastle to Sharm. Crew excellent on both legs and the aircraft was excellent inside and out. What a brilliant flight!

East Midlands to Antalya and return in May / June 2014. We pre booked our family seats together which worked fine. I'm 6'5" my eldest son is 6'6" and my wife is 6'1" but we couldn't pre book the extra leg room seats as we had children with us - fair enough. However the seats were very very cramped for us we literally couldn't move. The row in front was the extra leg room seats and was empty so once the flight was airborne we asked if a couple of us could sit in them. Guess what we were told to pay for them if we wanted to move despite having already paid for pre booking our seats and I would suggest being unsafely jammed in our seats. So as I wouldn't pay again we sat like sardines looking at empty spacious seats in front of us all the way. There was nothing available without paying. No water no headphones etc. What I found most unbelievable was that when the cabin was cold and people asked for blankets they were told to buy them at £5 each as part of the "comfort pack". You are constantly sold to. Drinks comfort packs snacks headphones duty free scratch cards. It's cringe-worthy. I could stomach it more if TC was a budget airline but it isn't.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
Travelled to Cuba paid for premium seats. What a joke - queues for toilets rudest staff I've ever met. Food very poor £4 for a small beer. I will use First Choice next time their in a different class. If your thinking of booking with Thomas Cook - don't.

TCX1326 and TCX1327 30/05/14 to 06/06/14. First time flying with Thomas Cook after always using economy airlines like Airtours and Ryanair and I am experiencing a 4 hour delay paid extra thinking that a package holiday was stress free and now think my money was not well spent. Airtours or Ryanair for me next time!

We booked a week in Altinkum which ended 30th May 2014 my partner myself and his 2 girls got picked up from hotel at 9am for transfer to airport on arrival other passengers on bus told us that they were told yesterday that our plane TCX 1603 will be delayed by 6hrs when we looked on board it was now 10hr delay. We asked for a Thomas Cook rep but was told as it was a military airport no reps allowed inside departures. No one giving us any answers we asked for refreshments and was bought cheese + tomato sandwich and a drink at 1pm. Thomas Cook Rep arrived at 1pm but would not come down to see us we eventually took off at 8.10pm only to be told as we approached Gatwick at 9.50pm that we were now being diverted to Birmingham airport the pilot gave the reason that they needed the plane at Birmingham to take holidaymakers to Corfu to avoid a late departure. Was told a Thomas Cook rep would meet us and direct us to coaches to take us back to Gatwick no one appeared and had to wander outside with luggage and children to find our own coach got to Gatwick at 2.30am. What should have been a 4hr flight ended up being 20hr journey home.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
Can't fault the plane or cabin staff service. However when we checked in at Orlando international airport our bags were 4KG over we were happy to pay (no problem at all) However they then told us that they have no card machines at all and could only accept cash! I find this hard to believe in this day and age how a big company cannot have a card machine. We explained to the check in assistant that we only had a credit card that would not let us take cash of it. Her response was "that's not my problem". We then had to wait 30 minutes for our cases to be brought back to us and we're given no alternative but to throw away things from our case or we were told they would not go on the plane.

Manchester-Holguin May 2014 A330. Good leg room friendly helpful staff great food including Cornish clotted cream for afternoon tea. The pilot was very good-pointing out sights and offering reassurance when we encountered turbulence. When you think about the value for money-flying transatlantic and then 2 weeks all inclusive it's incredible we don't have to fly the plane ourselves for that price.

My partner and me travelled on Thomas Cook returning to Glasgow from Rhodes on 21st May 2014 11.35pm. We arrived at Rhodes departure lounge 4hrs prior To our departure time. We did not expect at this time to be booked onto our flight home. However due to various check in problems with Thomas Cook and a faulty Carousel we were not given our seat allocation until an hour before departure time. We were allocated row 30 next to the toilets. The seat pitch on these planes are horrendous. The man in front was 6'4" and finding this situation intolerable as we were unable to move our seat backward and our space was compromised and claustrophobic. This gentleman was moved to A seat at the front of the aircraft. After a 4hr flight sitting in close proximity of the toilets was disgusting to say the least. I will never again fly with Thomas Cook I lodged a complaint with Cabin staff.

Dalaman to Manchester. Booked months ago and paid higher fare for afternoon return to avoid late night flight due to elderly relative in our party. Three weeks after booking our flight was subject to a "minor change" from 14.40pm to 21.20pm. Whilst on the actual holiday it was further altered from 21.20pm to 22.45pm. Third time they have done this and ruined our holidays never again.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
Manchester flight to Dalaman on an A330 and return also an A330. Both aircraft were filthy. Seats were torn and grubby. Paid for premium cabin on our outbound flight and was pathetic. Seats although had more than enough leg room had seriously narrow seats making very uncomfortable to say the least. Entertainment system was broken throughout the aircraft and even tho we had a Thomas Cook engineer on board it couldn't be fixed. Pointless having windows due to the amount of condensation between the panels you couldn't see anything. A total lack of interest from cabin crew. Pressed the cabin crew light to have a snotty stewardess come and turn it off only to say we're having a break now so we may come to you after if we have time. It was only a 4 hour flight and only wanted a can of Pepsi. How difficult would that have been for them I wonder? No the return things were even worse. The seat tray was only fastened on at one side and if tried to open it pulled the TV screen out of the seat headrest. Informed a stewardess and my reply was "oh ok" and she happily went on her way? The entire aircraft inside out was seriously dirty to the point it was almost worrying. We paid for a meal each on this return flight and I kid you not it was inedible! English breakfast and a steak and ale pie. The breakfast was nothing like advertised and the pie was burnt slop. There is one good point tho we only have one more holiday booked with Thomas Cook to endure then everything else has been booked through Thomson holidays. Nice modern clean aircraft with cabin crew who know how to look after their passengers.

Went to Cayo Coco in Cuba in March on Premium Economy. The issue was on both legs of the flight but was disruptive on the return as this was overnight. We paid the extra money to have wider seats so we could rest on the way home as we had a 3 hour drive when we arrived. The issue was that throughout both flights the toilet at the front of the plane was continually being used by people who weren't seated in Premium Economy and that there was a constant queue near us on the way out but more annoyingly on the way back the curtain across the galley was being continuously opened and closed and so the light stopped me sleeping. This was annoying as there are a block of toilets in the middle of the plane and on previous TC flights only people in Premium Economy have been able to use the toilet at the front. I would not fly with Thomas Cook Airlines again because of this.

We recently travelled to Almeria in Spain as a couple for a short holiday. We stayed in Roquetas de Mar and couldn't fault the resort however on the return flight with Thomas Cook I opted to purchase a hot meal. I selected Beef and Ale Pie which was described as a delicious savoury pie topped with puff pastry what I actually received was a disgusting brown mess. This meal cost me £5.50. I presume Thomas Cook employ people to taste and vet their products and suggest that whoever allowed this particular item to be included ion the In-flight menu should be relieved of their position.

Gatwick to Enfidha return. Flight out was a 757-200 with old seating that was cramped but not too uncomfortable for a 3 hour flight. I find some of the reviews on here amazing - it's a cheap holiday flight and you get what you pay for! Staff were friendly polite and efficient and we got there safely and not uncomfortably. What more can you ask? On the way back the plane was a 757-300 with new seating - a huge improvement not least as it doesn't recline. Nobody but nobody needs to recline on a short haul flight especially not when the person behind you is already cramped. Removing recline is a brilliant move!

We flew to Fuerteventura in mid April on a Boeing 757 seating was adequate - a very comfortable flight. We had a meal on board which was lovely and staff were very nice. We returned on an airbus which was great very comfortable with a TV available to watch. Again another lovely meal would fly with them again.

Just back from Cuba. I do not understand what people expect I know you have to buy drinks but on other airlines where they are "free" the price will be added onto to the fare price at least this way you have the choice whether to spend your money or not. Food was very edible we booked exit door seats no problems from this end but arrived at Holguin airport for return flight and found our booked seats had been sold. Very quickly sorted out and we got our seats staff worked very hard and were pleasant. This is second time with TC and have not been disappointed on either occasion.

We flew Cardiff to Orlando. New plane with lots of room. 2x4x2 seating. We came prepared after reading previous reviews. Took our own food and snacks and just bought drinks on board. Films were on demand and was pretty smooth flight with no delays. We were able to use our own headphones on this plane so didn't need to buy them. The flight back was an older plane and had 3x4x3 seating. Films were on a loop but it was a night flight so didn't bother us. Some people unhappy as plane was changed and they had pre booked seats. We didn't pay for this and we were still sat together in good seats so no issue for us. Old style head phone sockets but we had taken some adapters we bought for 70p off amazon so again didn't have to pay for films. For me the most important part of flying is safety. I felt Thomas Cook flew us there and back with minimum turbulence and the cabin crew were all lovely and were around quite a lot. They clear the rubbish quick as well so you don't have it all sitting in front of you for ages. A Cardiff flight was a massive bonus for us as well so would definitely fly Thomas Cook to Orlando again if they go from Cardiff. £2000 cheaper than Virgin so well done Thomas Cook.

MAN to FUE return. Outbound on brand new A321 with new style sears. As a 6ft 4 male the leg room was great and the flight was excellent. Only issue was the constant sell but this is the norm now. Return on an old a321 with old style sears. This was really tight and the sooner they revamp them the better. The crew did really well considering a passenger was taken ill. Overall not a bad experience.

Travelled in April 2014. Manchester - Orlando and return. Outbound leg on their ex BMI A330 which has been newly refurbished. Massive improvement on their other A330s! 2-4-2 seat configuration is so much better. New improved seats have a generous seat pitch and are designed in such a way that even me as a 6ft+ passenger could stretch my legs out without banging my knees/shins on the seat in front. Plus the adjustable winged headrests meant I could have a snooze without bobbing my head on the passenger next to me's shoulder. On demand PTV had good selection of films food and cabin crew were good as always. Return flight on one of the original Airtours/Mytravel A330s with the downstairs toilets. 3-3-3 configuration is very tight widthways and the PTVs are tiny and do not operate on demand all the films are on a loop which is very annoying. If Thomas Cook upgrade all their A330s to the same standard I would be happy to fly with them longhaul anywhere in the world.

I flew to Banjul in Gambia on a Boeing 757 in November 2013 and again January 2014 and again in February 2013. Food was good. I am 5ft 5 tall my knees were touching the seat in front. I felt quite claustrophobic. I fly about 5 times a year and this Thomas Cook flight from Manchester on the Boeing 757 is bad. The plane when I flew home in April was a Boeing 767 it seemed to be a new plane much more comfortable. The Captain was excellent I could actually hear what he said very clearly he was very informative. Normally the reception is distorted and I can't understand a word the captain says. Only one problem a very abusive passenger who also smoked in the toilet. The police were waiting when we landed. The scores for the review is based on my flight home. The scores would have been very low for my outbound flight.

I have been travelling 3-4 times a year with Thomas Cook for the last 5 years. Have had 1 delayed flight during this time. I'm going back to Turkey again to visit family in the summer. Thomas Cook prices seem to be more expensive than other airlines but I might be willing to pay the extra as I have no problems with Thomas Cook. Also travel with 2 kids!

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
The most cramped lack of space I've ever had on any aircraft! My knees were pressing into the seat in front no doubt to the discomfort of the person in that seat and to me also as the person behind also obviously had his knees wedged into the back of my seat. What a cattle truck! - and for 6 hours. Apart from comfort there must also be safety implications with people having difficulty getting out of their seat/row. Awful. Always had much more legroom on other operators aircraft.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
I flew back from Egypt yesterday on a 767. It was very uncomfortable. There was very little legroom so the man behind me had his knees resting on the back of my seat so I felt it every time he moved. The seats were very upright and didn't recline which is ridiculous for a 5 hour flight. The seat pockets were just slots that you couldn't put anything in and the tables were tiny and too high for comfort. The TV screens are up on the ceiling but it is hard to tip your head back comfortably in those seats. We were sitting right in the middle of the plane so most of the food drinks and duty free we wanted had sold out by the time they got to us. I don't want to fly with Thomas Cook again.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
Worst long haul flight I have had. If they spent more time and effort trying to make customers feel relaxed and valued rather than trying to squeeze every last penny out of people then it might be a good airline. I did have enough leg room but seats were very narrow. There were no air vents blowing out cold air so flight was very hot and uncomfortable. A lot of the entertainment screens did not work and the ones that did the volume was broken. Every other long haul flight that I have been on has given passengers free snacks and soft drinks at the very least but not Thomas cook they don't give you as much as a bottle of water unless you pay very unrealistic prices for them. When checking in all Thomas cook flight leaving that day checked in at the same desk which was just chaos and led to a very long wait. Unless you decided to take up the offer of the young girl offering passengers a quicker check in for another extra fee. All in all a very poor flight and very poor level of service by Thomas cook. The only good thing I can say about the airline is that it got me to where I was going.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
Dreadful flight to Cyprus from Manchester in March 2014. Asked for a window seat but was given 28a which is not a window seat because it's near the exit. In fact you could hardly call it a seat for a small person which I am. Very claustrophobic. Asked to move and staff very unhelpful. Basically if I had wanted a better seat I should have pre booked or upgraded. My shoulder was stiff the whole holiday as I had to lean in. Never will I fly with Thomas Cook again!

Manchester- Holguin (Cuba)- Manchester. March 19-28 2014. Airbus A330 outward replaced by absolutely ancient Boeing as former was 'poorly' announced the captain. 3 timed films on drop-down screens. No seat recline available on 10 hour flight ! Constant selling from staff. A330 now recovered for return 8.5 hr night flight. Pillows and blankets only available for limited number of passengers. No priority just lucky dip. Company Policy'. I only found seat recline lever within 1 hour of Manchester. Nobody else did. All passengers upright all night. Obviously in staff interest not to say because they have targets to meet re. headphones drinks (twice) duty-free questionnaires etc. Lights were down 2 hrs max. Really surprised how desperate the announcements were to push tobacco products. Lastly why does Thos Cook Airline teach its staff to use the p.a. as though a nursery teacher to 4 yr olds? Too patronising lacking respect. We are actually fare-paying adults.

Hurghada November 2013 and January 2014 from Manchester. Found check-in staff in November really unhelpful. We were told to weigh our hand baggage first and found to be 1Kg over. We explained it was the paperwork for the flight and certain medication but to no avail. We were made to take stuff out and place in hold bags she was very rude and although it was explained to her that people go to the duty free shops and fill their cabin bags with goods she said that this didn't happen! Also explained that 5Kg was a legal limit for cabin bags (total lie). January flight different again obviously different staff but helpful cheerful and made the transfer a non stressful event (as it should be). Both flights uncomfortable no leg room broken seats and the seemingly compulsory broken toilet on the return trips. Thank goodness Monarch are now flying to Hurghada approx 50% of the cost and better service. As frequent travelers to Hurghada we welcome this competition hopefully TC will up their game their whole booking online system is inadequate with frequent changes to aircraft and therefor your seat reservations. We found that paying to book your specific seat/s is a complete rip off. They can (and do) change your seat without telling you and let it be a complete surprise when you get on the (different) aircraft.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
Just returned from Cuba and was worried by bad reviews. We booked premium upgrade and seats and cabin were just as comfortable as Virgin. Only criticism is that the lights were not dimmed early enough on the return flight so unable to rest as much as would have wished. In economy the seats were narrow and it was hotter especially in the middle of the plane. Flight attendants were polite and helpful. As the upgrade is half the price of Virgin you would not expect wine with meals and free drinks on demand but tea or coffee is provided with the meal which was tasty choice of two mains. Drinks can be purchased. Tea £2.50. Choice of films or radio adequate. I enjoyed the flight even though it was longer than usual as the pilot diverted to avoid bad weather.

This flight was part of a P&O Cruise package and having flown Thomas Cook to Miami on another cruise charter a few years ago we were not looking forward to the experience! However both flights were on time the food was fine and the legroom has been improved dramatically since our last trip. I'm 6ft and had plenty of space in front of my knees even with the seat in front reclined. The crew and service provided on both legs was excellent.

Just returned from flight Barbados the worst airline we have travelled on. Booked extra leg room this was row 30 firstly seat near window should not have been charged for also not told toilets were there. People crowded there. Had long delay at Barbados airport and not 1 person from company came to departure lounge nothing offered in about 8hrs then had to collect baggage and go to different hotels at midnight then collected from hotels and once again taken to airport. Absolutely horrendous finally arrived in Manchester on Monday morning at 7am instead of Sunday at 4am.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
Main complaint is over seat spacing and lack of seat comfort. This was on an Airbus 321 from East Midlands to Lanzarote and back. How anyone would expect to be able to evacuate the aircraft in an emergency is little short of a joke. Looking at other reviews I was pleased not to have paid a premium all that seems to achieve is to add to the cost. Food was just about adequate with a hot drink served in a very small paper cup. At least the flights were on time in both direction and the cabin staff were pleasant enough. Could have done without the bombardment of announcements on the outward flight in connection with scratch cards and customer reviews - do they take any notice of the latter anyway?

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
We travelled from Manchester to Cancun and return on one of their Airbus A330-200. The aircraft has been reconfigured to a 2-4-2 seating plan. We were seated mid cabin in the 2 seat starboard side. There was sufficient legroom however the seats were narrow with little padding for this long hall flight. They were most uncomfortable. Do not book the extra legroom seat by entrance toilet your gets hit by the door every time it is opened.

Economy flight to Llieda (for skiing in Andorra). Fairly quick and efficient check-in. Hassle free boarding and greeted pleasantly onboard. However the flights to and back were ruined by the seat comfort. As a very seasoned and regular passenger on scheduled flights throughout the world the TC 757-300 aircraft had the most unpleasant uncomfortable seats that I have ever had the misfortune of using. I am around 6ft and my knees were jammed against the seat in front. The seats were very thin and offered little support. The tray table was higher than I am used to and around 2/3 of the standard size. When the mediocre food arrived it was a struggle to find room to eat. Clearly Thomas Cook believe that they have found a 'winning formula' to cram the maximum seating into the aircraft. They have lost my future custom and I am actively ensuring that I don't recommend them to anyone else.

Gatwick to Dalaman. Both times I have flown with this airline have been really bad. On one flight I was so cold and they refused to get my friend a blanket. The next time we were sat by the toilet and of course that's never good but mostly the problem was the tiny seats! I am a slim woman and not really that tall but I was so uncomfortable.

Outbound asked 4 times for a blanket only when the duty free trolley came round was I able to get one as I refused to buy anything until I got a blanket.

Went to Banjul Feb 2014. We are well travelled and have flown many times and I'm 6'1" and slim. This was by far the worst travel experience made even more uncomfortable by an extended trip to pick up fuel on way back in Las Palma's. The seats are ridiculously uncomfortable and we had a pair of drunken passengers behind us. We tried to upgrade our seats on the way back but sold out. I will never fly in these planes (757s) or with TC ever again.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
Flew to Banjul and back end January/early February from Gatwick. We had booked extra leg room seats and could not have endured the journey without them. The flight should have been 6.5 hours but took over 9 hours going out and 7.5 hours coming back because of unscheduled re-fuelling in the Canaries and issues loading cargo. Staff were great on both journeys plenty of communication (even when it was bad) and customer focused hostesses particularly on the return flight. The food was quite good for airline food. One film shown on outbound flight no entertainment system on inbound. On the outbound flight my seat was broken and I couldn't stop it reclining and crushing the knees of the tall gentleman behind me. It was a newer plane on the return journey and for the first time ever I had to have an extension seat belt (I'm a size 20 and 6 feet tall). All Thomas Cook need to make them a good airline is to increase their seat pitch. I just don't know how the tall people on our flights endured over 9 hours in such cramped conditions.

Very pleased to experience an excellent flight with Thomas Cook. I flew from Manchester to Barbados in January 2014. After reading all the negative reviews I was really worried about travel arrangements. From check in to arrival I could not fault anything the staff were very pleasant and helpful seats comfortable and food good (for an airline). I look forward to travelling with them again.

Flew TCX 148 on an A330 Manchester to Cancun on 21/1/14. Paid the 'Premium upgrade' not knowing that Thomas Cook had transformed themselves into an absolutely 'no frills' carrier! Everything was extra from headphones to tea coffee soft drinks water and of course alcohol! The meal was overheated and dry with a small tea or coffee included although no offer of a second cup. If I were James Martin I wouldn't want my name printed all over the food cartons! Cabin staff were unwelcoming and quite surly once we informed them of out dissatisfaction and disappointment when we compared the 'upgrade' to that offered by Thomson on the same route previously. One replied 'well you're not flying with Thomsom now'. Shall not fly with Thomas Cook again and would not recommend to anyone else on the basis of my experience. It's the first time I've ever been hungry and thirsty on a long haul flight. Not looking forward to the return flight.

Travelled premium class to Goa in Jan 2014 what a waste of money. The extra money pays for priority booking and extra weight and leg room. The service is poor having travelled this way with other operators I was looking for that bit extra forget it save your money. We paid over £300 for this about 70 bottles of their overpriced bottles of wine.

Gatwick-Cancun-Gatwick. TCX186 and TCX187 18 December 2013 - 1 January 2014. We had expected the flight from hell after reading some of the reviews but we were pleasantly surprised. Food was far better expected and the flight attendant on the flight back from Cancun to Gatwick was lovely. It's definitely worth paying for extra legroom.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
Our return trip with Thomas Cook airlines was one of the worst that I have come across. The crew were offhand and the cabin administrator on charge of the others was positively rude. The meal numbers had not been checked at Cancun so they did not realise that the correct number had been heated. By the time they reached our row they had run out and we were told that it would take another 45 minutes. On suggesting that we may be given a complementary drink (either soft or otherwise )the cabin chief steward told us that this was not going to happen in no uncertain terms and blamed the Cancun caterers for placing the food wrongly. He then said that it would be 20 minutes. We received half heated chicken!

My experience of Thomas Cook Airlines is a much more positive one than the majority posted here. Travelling for the second successive year from CWL to PFO in high season their performance was flawless. On time both ways efficient and personable cabin crew who worked as team and OK seat comfort. I can be difficult to please but there was really nothing to fault - although the ticket cost could have been better. My son wanted a model plane which was in the inflight brochure and they cheerfully found it for him. I recognised some of the cabin crew as being the same from the previous year and I would suggest that having a tight knit team operating out of CWL helps to avoid some of the flaws that have been identified elsewhere.

Flew Manchester-Cancun-Manchester on 30/11/13 - 11/12/13. We had pre booked seats well in advance and while this has always been honoured by TC in the past and was on this occasion I keep reading reviews of peoples seats not being reserved. I shouldn't have worried. Food was good. One or two passengers complain but seriously what do you expect a gourmet meal? It's not bad in the great scheme of things. The seat pitch is good and better than Virgin Long Haul and while the entertainment isn't on demand there is a wide range of choice. Cabin crew were ok going out much more attentive coming back. Will continue to fly with TC whilst we keep enjoying good experiences with them.

MAN-CUN-MAN 28th Nov/12th Dec. New to TCA A330 which has a had a complete interior re-fit only 31" legroom but felt like more and was ample seats comfortable with a good recline new good/clear quality touchscreen IFE also with USB socket so you could charge any gadgets you have 8 movies various TV shows and music channels food good but not very big portions overall a good experience for a charter long-haul flight would have no problem using them again.

Dreadful never again will fly with Thomas Cook. Flew Gran Canaria to Glasgow on a very old 757. Dreadfully slow loading procedure (took off 30 minutes late and no announcements in the airport on the delay) didn't board by row numbers so chaos in getting up the aisle cramped legroom poor attempt at inflight movie (understandably poor quality on a plane of this considerable age). Cabin crew did make up for the experience slightly in flight but generally a horrible experience.

Traveled Manchester to Barbados on the first flight out there on 10th November. We were even greeted by a steel band and water cannon salute. It was a comfy seat I think it was a new airplane and great service. The James Martin meal was lovely better than last time on another airline. Seat configuration was 2x3x2 so excellent when travelling in pairs. I would go on them again long haul.

Just returned from Banjul Gambia on TCX 1032/33. Not a good start when we all on board on time the Captain announced that "sorry we need another 10 minutes to upload more fuel". This made us actually 1 hour late - thought they would have known well before the flight how much fuel was required - doesn't inspire much confidence does it? Cabin crew were excellent and so was the food but how any self respecting airline can expect their customers to sit in a 28" pitch seat for a 6 hours flight is beyond me: this is really appalling. This airline is rapidly loosing the plot - they want to present the cheapest prices simply forgetting that not everyone want this - most want Value For Money which is definitely what you do not get with them.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
Don't ever fly with Thomas Cook to Goa. I travelled with a group of 8 people and booked their so called premium class seats. What a huge disappointment that was. As far as I am concerned Thomas Cook and Thomas Cook Airlines are not interested in their customers comfort and I would never use them on a long haul flight again.

Flew from Manchester to Mexico on 16th November 2013 and returned 1st Dec 13. We had pre booked seats on the way out row 8 no premium cabin but the seats were good. Decent legroom comfortable seats and good inflight entertainment. Touchscreen TV where you can pause start and stop movies when you liked. Cabin crew staff on the other hand different story. Not interested in anyone no order to what they were doing. Each time I went to the toilet cabin crew staff was stood by the toilets being rude about passengers and made no effort to stop or hide conversations when I came to use the toilet. This I find very unprofessional and uncomfortable. Check in lady at Manchester had no customer service skills never once made eye contact. Return journey. Plane was changed that morning for some reason so the layout of the plane was totally different to what it was when people paid to pre book seats! This meant that pre booked seats went out of the window. The plane was old and very small. Arm rests didn't come up so you had very little space to move! The TV screens tiny and fuzzy. Entertainment on a loop and the sound was crackling! The plane was dirty and very uncomfortable. A lot of people very unhappy due to all the moving around etc including myself. I paid to pre book my seats for a reason. The rep at the airport said TC are allowed to make changes at anytime and if this causes problems with your seating arrangements then complain when you get home! Staff on this flight better than going out but I still feel they need lessons in customer service skills. I found the food generally ok for plane food. Breakfast on the way home was a bit naff though a muffin and a yoghurt I was very surprised you had to pay for soft drinks I get paying for alcohol but soft drinks I would have thought would have been included. Overall a very disappointing experience from booking to coming home.

I travelled on a Saga Package to Turkey in Early October so didn't have a choice of airline. However everything about Thomas Cook was very good indeed with the exception of the leg room which was very cramped indeed. I am a vegetarian and the James Martin food provided was superb!

Just got back from a TC holiday from Cuba. We flew from Manchester to Cayo Coco there were no premium option available on the flight as it is the new A330. However as someone with dietary restrictions I was appalled. I ordered a Gluten free meal but clearly their catering department cannot be bothered other than providing a gluten free roll. The side dishes are usually given in a separate box. My OH has desert cheese biscuits etc. In mine one gluten free roll that's it. Nothing to replace the pudding. Tea time came and once again the food was served. The cabin staff could not be bothered firstly looking up who had ordered special meals so was firstly given a pack of sandwiches and a box again with something sweet. On correcting them they delivered mine. No alternative for the sandwiches instead a box with a gluten free roll and a banana. Nothing else. The return journey wasn't much better.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
We travelled as a family of four to and from Mexico. Considering I have flown dozens of times all over the world this has to be the worst experience yet. Firstly the cabin crew were unfriendly and found it appropriate to discuss their personal lives whilst handing out the food. They also found it acceptable to comment on the behaviour of someone else's child. Secondly we were given one pillow (of such cheap quality they were of no use) between three people and one blanket. When my 11 year old asked for another pillow the staff told her to look round for another one! Thirdly the crew took their breaks near to the toilets and felt it appropriate to read magazine and block everyone out even those who had queries. Fourthly the drinks are over priced and when you ring the bell to ask for another they just ignore. when we arrived to our destination we were so dehydrated as they also only come round a couple of times on a long haul. This really is an appalling airline. I accept it is a budget airline but really this takes the biscuit. Thomas Cook you need to up your game. We will never will fly them again.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
Just flown Thomas Cook Gatwick to Orlando - never again! Flight out was OK but coming back none of the aircraft seats reclined. Try spending 8 hours in a bolt upright position with very little leg room and a headrest that actually bends your head forwards. Needless to say nobody could relax let alone get any sleep on a night flight. On top of that one of our cabin crew was extremely rude and unprofessional they ran out of meal choices almost straight away the in-flight entertainment did not work properly and there were only a handful of pillows/blankets to go around. Worst flight ever which my back and neck is still suffering from a week later.

Long haul Gatwick to Cancun. Didnt bother to check airline reviews as I wrongly expected it to be long but half way comfortable it was almost unbearable. Seats became painful after about an hour I spent most of the flight standing. I presume the seats were old and had no padding left. With a layout of 3-3-3 there was no room when seated I had to be bolt upright as my elbows would have no room. The staff were obviously stressed out with that working conditions you could barely move the trolley down the aisle. There were no free drinks or snacks but most of the time there was a trolley in the way selling scratchcards or duty free. Just a painfully uncomfortable flight. Also when we got there we were told that we were responsible for the airline departure tax on return was several stressed out staff taking cash only payments. I said i would pay but only if I got a receipt this was refused? Very strange behaviour not taking card payments or giving a receipt. Flight back was same as flight over but an hour shorter. Will do my homework and research to avoid another long haul from hell with TCA.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
Travelled to and from Turkey at the end of October - holiday from heaven but flights from hell. Paid extra for the extra leg room seats but I wonder why as these were of an inferior quality and actually seemed narrower than the normal seats. Don't get me wrong I didn't expect plush seats but I did expect a little more than we got and certainly expected that I would be able to put the table across my knee to eat my meal. The extra legroom seats were also made pointless as the cabin staff were constantly blocking the aisle so they could sell their wares thus causing passengers wanting to get to the toilets to congregate in the space that was sold as the extra leg room. Inflight film looked like it may have been worth a watch apart from the fact the screen was so far away you would need binoculars to watch it and to hear it would be impossible in the extra leg room seats as to plug in the over priced headphones would mean sawing your leg off. Food was hot but pretty much inedible (to me at least). Luckily the food was included in the package as it is definitely not worth bothering with. No choice in what you are served up - just get what they have left. Yes I will fly again with them but only because the hotel I like in Turkey can only be booked through them. Yes it is a budget airline but they don't half fleece you when they take £30 each way off you for the extra leg room seats that are not fit for purpose.

Flew to Cuba with Thomas Cook on 21/10/2013 A330 economy. I have to say after reading some of the reviews I had a few worries but I was presently surprised. I'm 6'4 and a bit of a wide load although the seats were a bit on the narrow side the leg room was very ample fortunately I have a skinny wife so I had a bit of over spill space I did keep leaning on the controls of her TV which she did find a bit of an annoyance. I don't go on flights for the food but it was quite good in fact much better than the last time I flew with BA and Thomson. Ok so you get nothing included for free but this is long haul Budget flying and worked out allot cheaper than other suppliers (£500 or so for the 2 of us). The cabin crew on outward and inward flights were brilliant. Very polite even when some of our fellow passengers seem to go out of their way to be awkward and rude. Please remember this is a budget airline! Looking forward to returning next year.

Manchester to Menorca Flight TCX2442 17 August 2013 Return Flight TXC2443. The outbound flight the scheduled aircraft was withdrawn and replaced by a standby plane. The standby aircraft had two less seats. As a result there was no seat for me and I was allocated the jump seat at the back of the plane. Thomas Cook offered a £70 voucher as compensation which I have rejected. The return flight to Manchester was delayed by nearly 6 hrs.

I travelled to Cuba which is a 7 hour flight I was shocked to know that you have to pay for soft drinks. I can understand if they were charging for alcoholic drinks but water and soft drink is disgraceful. We were given 15kg for a two week holiday but others were given 20kg we had to pay an extra £20 each way £40 for what others got free same holiday destination. Thomas Cooks priority was making money it is not customer service or customer satisfaction. We will not be cooking with Thomas Cook again. Most disappointing.

Glasgow to Gran Canaria (Las Palmas) then Tenerife South to Glasgow. Both flights were on time with friendly cabin crew. Plane in both directions was a pretty old Boeing 757-200 which had seen better days although to be fair the outbound flight had been fitted with new seating. Flights on time in both directions food served was fairly average and pretty much what I expect these days. Main gripe is that 5kg hand-luggage allowance is pretty mean even Ryanair allow more!

We have just flown from Manchester to Sanford we paid for premium and all we got was a bit more room. We had to pay for all drinks except tea/coffee we also had to pay for headphones. Staff were polite but didn't want to be there. On the return we had a problem with check in because our bags were over but under 30kg we had to open all our cases and rearrange. Then we were not allowed to take a handbag and our hand luggage we finally got through after paying. The flight again awful premium is a joke again nothing free. Pay all the way and when we asked for a pillow/ blanket we were told we had to help ourselves. We have always flown premium for the extra room etc and this was awful no drinks headphones amenity pack no pillow or blanket. Look somewhere else.

I have just returned from holiday from Tunisia we flew from Birmingham TCX4028/9 16th until 23rd Oct 2013. I agree the legroom is not the best but you get what you pay for I'm well aware when I travel on a charter flight that your not going to get legroom so I cant understand why people complain about their seats. If you want comfort pay to go business class with British Airways. The seats in general were very good and the crew had told us that the aircraft had just had new seats fitted. Products are expensive to purchase on the flight but again its a charter flight not a scheduled airline so you have to expect to pay the airline is a business at the end of the day and has to make money! The meal was very nice made by James Martin and we had a choice of meal on way home something that my airline back in the day did not offer. Staff onboard were excellent on the outward flight spoke to every row of passengers and were very funny. Inward flight crew were very good again. I shall be flying with them again.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
While the flight there and back was very good and the food was lovely we felt totally ripped off because my husband paid £200 to upgrade us to premium the only good thing about it was by passing everybody to get through security. I know other airlines give you free drinks newspapers  headsets and amenity kits wine with dinner and choice of food. No such luck with Thomas Cook you get a little bit extra legroom and priority boarding. I enjoyed the return journey more because the cabin crew were much more friendly. Next year we are going with Monarch. We flew from Manchester to Sanford on 4th of October and returned on the 18th.

We flew from Manchester to Las Vegas a 10 hour flight on 29/09/13. On the way out they hadn't had their delivery of headphones or something so we couldn't watch anything on the TV's which when you have a 10 hour flight is usually the best part 10 hours with nothing to watch isn't much fun. I've flown with various flights long haul and have to say Thomas Cook have been the worst so far one measly meal and a snack over 10 hours is rubbish no free drinks which you get with KLM when flying long haul. They also ran out of meal options by the time they got to us so we only had the one option and it wasn't that great. It was slightly better on the way back as we had headphones this time but the choice of entertainment was very poor four films that were on a loop and when your film finished you had a wait in between before you could start watching something else. Other flights I've been on long haul have much better entertainment with multiple channels playing tons of films programmes etc constantly throughout the flight. I won't be flying with Thomas Cook long haul again.

Delayed 3.5 hours flying home from Lanzarote on Sunday no apology explanation or offer of a voucher. My friend was delayed departing on the outbound flight for the same period off time on the way out to Lanzarote. Meanwhile my mother sister and niece faced a 5 hour delay at Murcia airport. All were flying with Thomas Cook. It seems strange that they have 3 or so flights departing at exactly the same time both inbound and outbound and there is always one that is delayed by similar times due to 'technical errors' in one case and no explanation for the others. I also have never met such rude cabin staff on a flight.

6 October East Midlands to Lanzarote. Airbus A321 booked extra legroom seat A26/A27 next to a door so no window but quite comfortable. Standard seats looked very tight and uncomfortable. Departed 15 minutes late but arrived 30 minutes early. Cabin crew very unprofessional. Never smiled and just threw food and drinks etc at everyone. In this day and age 5kgs hand luggage limit is ridiculous! Travelled with TCX because they were much cheaper than Jet 2 on this occasion. However Jet 2 can certainly show the TCX staff a thing or two!

The worst ever flights. They make even Ryanair look good and that's hard to do. From Manchester to Holguin Cuba the laziest and rudest cabin crew ever known atrocious "Food" worst inflight service imaginable inflight entertainment service not working to make up for that they offered a free drink. The flight back was even worse they kept the cabin at freezing so that you could not sleep that's because they want to disturb you every few minutes by trying to flog you their incredibly overpriced items and of course the food was just as bad. We intend to go back to our favourite resort in Cuba next year but we will not fly this "Mickey Mouse" airline ever again.

Coming back from Turkey last week queues at the airport were very long. I found out why these queues are caused by people with overweight bags. They know the rules. Why don't the Thomas Cook staff tell the check in desk to inform them when they have got a customer with an overweight bag so these people can be moved to a separate queue. The ones that stick to the rules can then go through without problems.

Flew from Gatwick to Antalya on 10th October. Flight due to leave at 9.30am - was delayed till 4.30pm. Reason given for delay was a technical issue with the plane. A painful 9 hours in Gatwick for all passengers - given that most would have arrived at 7.30am for check in. Food vouchers were given out - if you happened to hear about it. Returning after a good holiday on October 17th we experience another set of delays. The 5.15pm flight from Antlaya did not leave until 10.30pm. The reason for delay was the incoming flight was struck by lightning during a torrential storm and had to be diverted to another airport for landing - before coming back to Antalya. So I was OK with this - and happy to be finally on my way. Only for the announcement on the plane that we were going to have a stop in Vienna ! - to pick up a replacement set of cabin crew - as the existing crew would have worked over their hours and could not per regulations fly with us to London. Thomas Cook lost all credibility here by not telling us this info before we boarded the plane (so passengers had a chance to advise anyone meeting them at Gatwick of the change in arrival time) - and also they lied to passengers by saying we would only be on the ground at Vienna for 5 minutes as the replacement crew would be waiting for us. This was not the case - we were on the ground at Vienna for 1hr 20 minutes (in the plane) waiting for the replacement crew to arrive from London. Finally we get underway with another painful 2 hours at Gatwick - arriving at 3.45am - much later than our scheduled 7.50pm arrival. Thomas Cook lose all credibility by their dishonesty and lack of clear information on flight delays. Just be upfront and give the facts when you know them - don't dress things up to save face. I also question the large number of flight delays they have - as evidenced by the comments of other passengers. Why does this airline have so many technical issues with their aircraft? It means if you book with Thomas Cook you have to factor in long delays to your trip. Otherwise book elsewhere.

Travelled Cancun to Manchester. Cannot believe the rudeness of staff on this airline! Entertainment system broken! Pilot tried telling us it was more important to get plane ready for return journey than sitting on the runway trying to mend system! There was various rude comments made throughout the flight to passengers around me which were uncalled for and very unprofessional. A male hostess asked a colleague about some duty free to which she replied "what do you want me to do climb over the seats and have a look! The attendant he was talking to was very rude throughout the whole flight and really gave the impression she did not want to be there - well neither did we! Absolutely appalling!

Antalya - Gatwick return. I had to fly the outward leg Thomas Cook as I was taking a cat back to the UK and they are the only direct carrier that takes animals but I made the mistake of booking a return with them when I should have chosen another carrier such as Easyjet or Monarch of whom I've heard good reports on this route. Outward flight was OK nice cabin crew as always I'd paid extra for a bulkhead seat which gave me a bit of extra legroom but spent quite a lot of time standing in the over-packed aircraft. Return was a nightmare. 8 hours at Gatwick waiting for them to provide a replacement for an aircraft damaged on the tarmac. How can a so-called 3-star airline not have contingency aircraft for this - especially when it seems to happen to them so regularly? Absolutely appalling. Why do passengers put up with this? I'd paid for a legroom seat so was reasonably comfortable but apart from a £10 food voucher there was no compensation for the eight hour wait. I also paid for the 'Priority Bag' service on both legs - a total swindle my bag only turned up after at least half of the other passengers had already claimed theirs. Luckily I have other choices. Before this I was wondering if it was still worth flying via Istanbul just to get on a BA flight but this experience has proved that it definitely is. I will never fly Thomas Cook again - I'd rather fly via Reykjavik than entrust my comfort to them again and even then I'd probably get there sooner!

Flight to Lanzarote 26/9/13. 4 hrs of uncomfortable hell with Thomas Cook packed in like sardines in a can no entertainment so restricted movement in the seats I had problems trying to eat the miserable meal that they provided. If the seat in front of you is reclined you would not even read a book as there was no room in front of you to hold a book so you have to sit there clock watching to pass the time. I had to stand at the back of the aircraft several times because my legs went numb and I was concerned about DVT. When I discussed my concerns about the risks of DVT the Cabin staff said well you could have ordered a seat with extra leg room for only £10 yes they say £10 but it is really £40 extra myself and my wife £20 out £20 back. We should have learnt from or experience with Thomas Cook back in 2010.

Manchester - Rhodes 21/9/13. Check in quick polite lady on desk couldn't hear which rows were being boarded so caused confusion. Flight comfortable good cabin crew IFE male crew member even took time to pause film while announcements being made. Rhodes - Manchester 2/10/13. Check in quick kept opening more desks to accommodate. Flight time was 15.35 but they started boarding passengers at 14.10 saying they were flying out early within the next 15 mins which was bit suspect as they hadn't put announcement out or displayed on board. Pilot said it was due to headwinds as the flight would be 30 mins longer. As I suspected we left on scheduled time and arrived scheduled time they just wanted to alleviate people capacity at Rhodes airport! Cabin crew mostly aloof one more mature crew member down to earth and helpful. Left hand side took so long to serve anything! Had to take what was left of the booked meal as right hand side had given the more choice out. But right hand side refused to take my rubbish waved her hand and said I was to wait until left hand asked for it. Pilot chirpy and funny. Two films on though they constantly spoke over the film especially at the end of it. Why do crew members hog the aisles and ignore you waiting to get past? Had terrible back ache within ten minutes of sitting down which lasted the whole flight and I am only 5ft 3" the review will score lower as the return flight was worse which let the outbound team down.

Flew from Manchester to Las Vegas on 29/09/13 the best thing I can say is that the flights were on time and the staff were polite. The passengers were a surly lot. The staff had forgotten to load any headsets so unless you had your own then you could not access the "inflight entertainment". Mind you "inflight entertainment" was a bit of a misnomer as there were only 4 rubbish films and ancient half hour TV comedies. Still on a 10 hour flight you need a little light distraction but without headsets we couldn't even have this escape. All in all we would avoid Thomas Cook flights if this one was an example; we have flown to Vegas with Virgin Airlines and will stick with them in future.

After all flying is just a tiny part of your well earned holiday.

Manchester to Jamaica found staff to be unfriendly rude and not very helpful. They had ran out of chicken at row 20 and we were row 26 we heard them state to one another that no chicken left and never enough are packed. When they reached our row we were not informed sorry no chicken only sausages left they just sat a tray down with no explanation or conversation. This was our first flight travelling with Thomas Cook and despite reading reviews before travelling was prepared for not as good air experience as others in past but were very disappointed. They spent most of time trying to sell you food drink and bingo cards! Bearing in mind it was an 11 hour flight not much offered free in respect of fluids. The earphones were another rip off but luckily after reading reviews had taken our own but sound quality was pore as was the choice. It was like watching the big TVs from years ago that we're on the wall only they were on seat back they run same movies and programmes over and over. On return we were delayed 4 hours but luckily were told to remain in hotel until picked up. Had a choice of meal on way back. The staff were all very unfriendly and not approachable at all. Only plus point was the hotel and rep were first class but flights were less than acceptable for a major tour operator. From the majority of reviews on this site not a lot of people have a good experience of travelling with them. Would avoid in future and travel with other airline if possible.

Flew Thomas Cook due to the fact that we only had a week to get to Goa and back and they are one of the few airlines that fly direct to Goa. Flight out was passable return flight back to Gatwick was the flight from hell. The crew member I dealt with would have been better off behind a bar after being in the air for 3 hours I had to ask for a drink as nothing had been offered to us. I didn't mind paying as my wife and I were getting so thirsty the steward stated to myself that they have to look after passengers that have paid for meals on board first! I requested coffee times twice the air steward huffed and puffed returned from the trolley with 2 plastic tumblers 2 cheap coffee sachets 2 powdered milk sachets and 2 sugar sachets placed his hand in front of my face and stated "that's £5.60 pal". Never felt the need to complain about an airline before. An additional surcharge for any luggage you take with you and put in the hold yes any suitcase was charged extortionate money each way not additional luggage but any suitcase who goes somewhere on a 9 hour flight and only takes hand luggage? Would have been cheaper to fly Air India or even Emirates to Mumbai.

Really old 757-200 flight from LGW-HRG. Flight time 4 hrs 37 minutes. On time flight from LGW landed at HRG 20 minutes early ok seat legroom was as expected slightly cramped but no different pitch to most airlines. Window was scratched badly and could hardly see out of it! Nice Crew and Inflight meal and they played a Inflight Movie. Would I use TCX again? Yes they were the cheapest airline over to Hurghada so value wise cant complain. Coming back from HRG it was cheaper for me to book a Easyjet flight home - found the aircraft much nicer and a newer designed seat with better leg room. Cant complain would use Thomas Cook again.

Travelled from Glasgow in late September to Funchal. Dismayed by the length of queues for check on but impressed with the speed at which they moved. There is only one queue for all flights. The flight was absolutely full. We were unable to have seats together but at 6 ft 3 I was glad of an extra leg room seat. The added bonus of being trampled on by people waiting for the toilets was not brought to my attention. The meal which was included was a breakfast and notwithstanding the difficulty of eating it on a tiny fold out table it was not too bad. The crew worked very hard and one had the impression that they were embarrassed at having to sell bingo cards. The return left about an hour late due to a bird strike inbound but we were kept up to date by the flight crew throughout although why we had to board on time and then sit for nearly an hour and a half was not explained. The meal on the return was in all honesty the most disgusting thing I have ever been offered. Overheated and shrivelled vegetables the smallest piece of beef ever and an awful pudding. I probably would use them again where there is no alternative but after this would bring my own food and avoid the aisle seat next to the toilets.

Flight 718 Manchester to Las Vegas Wed 18th Sep 2013. Flight attendants were rude refusing to take rubbish which I had taken to the back of the plane and was sent back to my seat. My friend overheard two flight attendants talking about passengers whilst they served along the plane. Totally unprofessional. Entertainment system dated and basic. As a frequent long haul traveller this is the worst entertainment system I have seen. Small choice of films and programmes and unable to pause stop and watch at your own convenience. On the return flight the entertainment system was broken and was advised to purchase books and magazines to keep ourselves entertained at our own cost. Half hearted apology from the Captain who also clearly thought he was a comedian. No apology from miserable cabin crew and no offer of a free drink to soften the disappointment. This was my first time flying with TC and to be honest I was very disappointed with the airline staff and on-board services. TC is nothing more than long haul budget airline - charging for soft drinks unprofessional staff rubbish entertainment system (when its working!) poor quality food which I'm sure James Martin would not feed to his dog's! The plane we travelled on (an old MyTravel plane) at one point I wasn't sure it would get us home from all the creaking it was making! The seats were not too bad but there was no padding in the head rests which did not adjust the lighting would not turn off causing the lights to shine in our ours for the whole 11 hours journey! I would love to say I would never fly again with TC but unfortunately I am booked to fly to Mexico with them next year. I will be prepared for this flight knowing how rubbish they are and will not expect anything more than poor service and rubbish entertainment. TC advertise themselves as a premium holiday company. There is nothing premium about their planes staff or on- board services. I have had better service from budget airlines.

Travelled to Cancun from Glasgow Sep 9th 2013 so for the 10 hr flight we booked the Premium Cabin and paid £400 extra for outward and inward flights. We arrived at Glasgow airport and even though we had priority check in we still had to queue for 15 mins then on the aircraft we were seated in 1e and 1f we were not offered a welcome drink that most other airlines offer to Premium customers I was astounded when they told me we had to purchase headphones for the movies which I did and when I plugged them in I got nothing but crackling. Then they came round with drinks and informed us we had to purchase them what a rip off. We had children across from us whose parents were offered the same seats we paid £400 for. This put a stop to any chance of peace in this so called Premium Cabin. The drinks service and food service started from the rear of the plane so Premium Cabin customers were served last. After all the services were done the cabin crew pulled the curtains and proceeded to talk loudly to each other and laugh out loud so much for peace and quiet in their Premium Cabin. Meals were poor even though they advertise them as special for Premium Cabin. Same happened on return flight kids who had been offered the seats at discounted prices kept everyone awake for 10 hours. This service is a total rip off at the advertised prices.

We got delayed for 11 hours because our plane had broken down had to sit in the airport freezing as they had run out of blankets! Horrible unwelcoming staff during the flight! Such an uncomfortable flight got split up from my fiancee even though we booked together! Will not be using this airline ever again. I would of been a little more calm if the airline crew could of apologised in a better way instead of instructing us that it wasn't there fault for the delay!

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
Without doubt the worst airline I have had the misfortune of flying with. I have recently had a fantastic holiday in Mexico the only downside was the flights. Outbound I managed to pay for the premium seats no problem with these comfortable and roomy but homeward bound only extra legroom seats were available.No problem with the legroom but the seats are ridiculously small and narrow. I can only compare the width to that of a child's car seat. Uncomfortable hard and so narrow that to get comfortable is impossible. It would appear that Thomas Cook have tried to cram in as many seats as possible and ignored the comfort of its passengers. On a long haul flight of 10 hours it can only be right that you would expect a degree of comfort but with Thomas Cook forget it. I and I would expect others would willingly pay a little more especially on long haul flights just to not be crippled by the time the flight is over. Virgin and several other airlines have got it right and I for one will never fly with this cattle herding shower again.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
Glasgow-Tenerife return trip. Seats very cramped even for those of an average height. Plane was dirty - chewing gum on pocket crumbs all over floor on entering plane have to pay for all snacks even water and they constantly trying to sell something either food/drink scratchcards and duty free. entertainment a joke - one movie on shared screens with headsets that also had to be purchased. would not fly with them again unless desperate.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
Appalling seat comfort after 20 mins of a 8.5 flight I had back ache spent most of the trip stood up this is the worst flight we have ever had. Crew more interested in flogging duty free then looking after passengers. TC you need to be ashamed of yourselves for packing people into sardine cans. Flight was from Manchester to Punta Cana the return flight was delayed but this seemed to be the norm for TC. Entertainment was old hat and the supplied ear phones of very poor quality - better to take your own. The cost of sitting together is just another con by the airline. Old tatty aircraft with uninterested flight crews.

Birmingham to Ibiza. Old dirty plane. We had pre purchased meals on board but these were only served after snacks and drinks had been sold. Disinterested cabin crew who were just going through the motions no eye contact or any attempt to interact with customers in fact the senior crew member on return sector spent her time during taxi sat on the jump seat with her back to the passengers to avoid any contact - so much for safety and observing the cabin. During boarding they spent most of the time gossiping in the galley and it was well over 30 mins before they started any service after takes off due to chit chat between themselves  then there was a rush at the end to finish tax free sales. Good parts were the flight being on time and quick delivery of bags.

TCX2142 / TCX2143 MAN to FUE and return on 4 and 11 September 2013. As part of the booking I paid for the ability to book our seats. Once I had the booking reference I went onto flythomascook website to book the seats. However it would not let me do it without charging me extra. I therefore had to ring the customer services line to sort it out. The boarding arrangements at Manchester Airport were chaotic to say the least. The boarding gate was next to the Emirates A380 and both flights were boarding at the same time with the inevitable crush. When it came to time to board the announcement for boarding by row number was not heard by 95% of the passengers resulting in everyone going to the gate. In fact the announcement was for the back few rows but no-one could hear it. A number of people were therefore refused boarding because it was not their row but others outside the announced rows were allowed on. None of the announcements could be heard by those waiting for the flight. I have never been on a more cramped flight (both outbound and inbound). Leg room was impossible. Food on both flights was disgraceful easily the worst in-flight food I have ever tasted. I am not sure how James Martin would react to having his name used for such poor food. As a diabetic I order diabetic meals for myself for both flights. On the return flight my meal tray was 75% white rice a little bit of beef and three small green beans. The diabetic meal was totally unsuitable. My wife's meal on the return was totally inedible (and she usually likes airline food).

I flew from Crete to Gatwick arrive at the airport to be told there is a 4 hour delay. I ask why we weren't alerted with a text or email as they ask for this information and they told me that airlines "don't do that" I mentioned that EasyJet do and they said they don't have the capability but if we were booked on a tour a tour guide could have come and told us. The people on the ground in Crete were so condescending to the point of actually saying "I'm not trying to be condescending but" and when we got on the plane there was no apology or explanation for the five hour delay. They then shamed an old man for asking for an aisle seat as his knee was really sore even after he explained it was due to sitting in the airport for an extra five hours in her loudest voice the flight attendant declared that the plane would be further delayed as they would have to offload his luggage as he refused to take his seat. The plane was freezing and we ended up getting in at six in the morning so we completely wasted $300 on the hotel we'd booked for the night and never used.

We travelled Glasgow to Zakynthos on 25th August. Flight out on time however two passengers in particular who were quite obviously drunk at boarding were asked by staff to step aside. Relieved thinking that they would not be allowed to board but to our amazement they were allowed on and on top of that the cabin crew still served them alcohol on board. A very tense flight knowing that they could cause a problem at any time. Had a fantastic holiday but on our arrival at Zakynthos airport it was a complete and utter farce. We had under 20kgs each going out from Glasgow and no problems. On our return our cases were actually weighing less than when we went out yet they were saying that we were 3kgs over and were telling lots of people that they were over. The farcical bit was when we emptied from our main luggage into hand luggage which quite obviously was then over 5kgs each - they allowed the cases! To top all that you then had to take your cases back to stand in another queue to put them through a scanner. Completely and utterly a pointless exercise other than to extort money. Be very careful on your return journey as they want 18 Euros for every kilo over. We made the decision to empty items from the cases into our hand luggage but some people were being stung not realising that you could simply take stuff out and put in back in once you had left check in. Utter madness! Flight back left early which was good but not particularly impressed with Thomas Cook staff either. They were pleasant enough but were not particularly professional. We didn't particularly want to listen to their ailments what curtains they were buying for their house and what they were getting up to on nights out. First time I have flown with Thomas Cook and I would be loath to travel with them again.

Flew Manchester - Hurghada - Manchester early September. Outbound flight was delayed half an hour so not much of a problem. Having travelled with TC several times previously and never having experienced problems I try not to concern myself too much with the reviews of others. Both flights had decent entertainment on board cabin crew were friendly pilots kept us updated with the flights' progress food was good and enough leg space. Will continue to fly with TC.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
8/8/13 LGW to Lanzarote. I am 6'3" and it is all but physically impossible for me to sit in the seats. Think it was a 757. I have never been so horribly uncomfortable on a flight and surely it is bordering on dangerous for Thomas Cook to sell these seats without some form of warning that tall people can't fit in them. Had such a warning been available I would have paid for the extra room (as I had to do on the return flight) but this was not pointed out at any point and as I don't fly package very often I did not expect it to be this bad. It is unsafe for me and those around me and also makes it difficult for the air crew to move up and down with their trolleys selling overpriced drinks and other tat. I don't expect lavish comfort on a package flight but I don't expect unsafe and ridiculously cramped conditions either. They seriously need to warn people about this before something bad happens. At least print it in the brochures or flag it up at time of booking so that you are at least offered an option. Also the airline staff could do with some training in customer service.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
Thomas Cook do not care about customers. Outbound flight was the worst. The cabin crew were only interested in selling duty free goods. Choice of food was very limited and what I did buy was smashed to bits. No leg room at all and seats so close together there was no room to move at all. The safety announcements were announced in a very unprofessional way as if they were bored stiff of saying the same thing to their customers and spoken so fast! On arriving at holiday airport it was announced that we had landed at East Midlands Airport! On return journey we had to queue for 2 hours to check in giving us no time to look around duty free. There was no apology. People were tired and irritable especially those with young children. Wont use Thomas Cook ever again.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
Possibly the worst airline I have flown. when we first arrived on the flight from Gatwick to Dalaman the seat my wife was sitting in was broken and the legroom was non existent. The seats were so small that sitting for more than 30 minutes was just not possible and I stood up most of the time. I am only just over 6ft so not exceptionally tall. We managed to leave 2 hours later with not a word from anyone about what was happening. I am appalled with TC.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
We flew Gatwick to Cancun on 12th August for 2 weeks and found both flights perfectly acceptable. Took off spot on time both flights and landed early. Cabin crew very professional. Food really good plenty of legroom although a pain that the arm rests don't move. Only couple of gripes - could do with more drinks or invitations to go and get some as its a long flight for the trolley to only come round twice and could have done with some water I asked for a blanket for my daughter on the outbound flight but they never came back to me asked on the return flight and did get one. Booked row 10 on way back but no window it a massive issue but worth noting for future. Flew BA last year and had reason to complain about several things to them so this compared very favourably.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
Outward flight 24/8/13 Inward flight 31/8/13 Birmingham-Rhodes on 757 aircraft. Legroom on both flights was appalling and the distance between seats so tight that you could not even put the trays down both flights were full with no spare seats at all. Passengers consisted mainly of families many with babies/young children travelling on laps and am surprised that this is allowed with the lack of space between seats on these aircraft. After take off some thoughtless people were then reclining their seats trying to get another inch or two of space causing even more cramped conditions for those behind them and friction between passengers erupted on more than one occasion. No entertainment at all on the 4 hour flight and crew only interested in selling duty free and other on board saleable goods. This airline in my opinion have absolutely no interest in the comfort of passengers and would definitely not travel with them again which is a shame because all other aspects of my holiday were excellent.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
In my opinion the worst airline I have ever had the misfortune to fly with. Suffered a 24 hour delay on a flight to Las Vegas with them. Ground staff told us that our aircraft was stuck in Florida but that that flight had been due to depart the US at least 12 hours before our flight was due to check in so Thomas Cook were fully aware there was a delay and yet they were claiming it was unexpected! We were made to hang around the airport for 7 hours before any update was given and the ground staff refused to help. When we eventually got on the flight all we heard from the cabin crew was how they had lost a day of their long stay on their 'big stay' in Vegas. They couldn't care less about customers and I would never use them again.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
LGW-AYT return. I was really not looking forward to these flights based on previous people's reviews but actually it was perfectly acceptable and not as bad as I feared. Plane was old and not great for legroom but cabin crew were friendly and efficient. Outward was an hour late for which they apologised and didn't try to blame anyone else for it which was refreshing. Inbound flight was on time and actually landed early. Inflight entertainment was overhead screens with a couple of films an you could rent headphones or buy adapters. I always hate the scratch card sales etc. but presumably others like this as they were selling. Overall I wouldn't choose them over a flag carrier but wouldn't go out of my way or extend a journey time to avoid them.

Flew to Dalaman on 3/8/13 8 hour delay at Gatwick there was a party of 7 we were supplied with £10 vouchers to cover lunch! We had 2 meals and drinks during this period which came to far more than £10. Technical problem was the reason for the delay spoke to others who said they had suffered in this manner before it was our first time with Thomas Cook. On the aircraft the seats were ridiculously tight and we are only 5 ft 9 and 5 ft 2 I would hate to be tall in these seats. The interior was old shabby uncomfortable and as previously stated in these reviews I must concur the cabin crew were unprofessional and quite frankly useless. On our return 2 weeks later we were once again delayed for a further 3 hours for technical problems. We were all very disappointed with this airline for a flight that cost £383 (budget I think not). On our landing at Gatwick it took 35 minutes to disembark a 10 minute bus ride to the terminal and a further 30 minutes to reclaim our baggage.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
Having read a lot of reviews and being a 5'8 size 24 woman I was incredibly worried about my flights with Thomas Cook to say the least. I was worried about leg room the table not fitting my frame or and this was worrying me most - the seat belt not doing up. I need not have worried. We flew Gatwick - Menorca and back in an Airbus A330-200 with seat configuration 3x3x3. Not only did the seat belt fasten easily but I had at least 8 inches to spare on it. Seats were comfortable despite the armrests not being moveable on the flight home. Leg room was fantastic and I could stretch my legs out fully. Food on board was usual aircraft fare but pleasant enough. Our outward flight was at 6 in the morning so breakfast was served. On our return flight we were served chicken breast roast potatoes sausage stuffing ball and vegetables bread roll and cheese and crackers with a moist and tasty syrup sponge for dessert. Flight attendants were helpful polite and efficient. Flights landed on time and the aircraft were clean and tidy. No inflight entertainment but then again no airline provides this for a 2 hour flight. I have nothing but positive comments for this airline.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
Flew to Orlando paid for extra leg room - what a joke. Had the emergency life raft in front of me so had even less room row 9 seat j. You have to pay for ear phones to watch the inflight entertainment. Cabin crew only interested in selling duty free. Only good thing about the flights was the return flight - landed 50 mins early!

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
Flew to Reus from Newcastle limited legroom. I've recently had a knee replacement and I found this uncomfortable. I ignored all the inflight selling and wasn't pestered. Home was better with more room. We understand any airline running this type of operation has to maximise selling opportunities. On landing we were parked quite a way from the terminal at Newcastle!

Travelled back from Dominican Republic 6 August and have to say I have never come across Cabin Crew that were so unprofessional. They were bickering amongst themselves in earshot of myself and other passengers. One particular Cabin Crew was downright rude to a fellow passenger who wanted to use the rear toilet instead of the lower toilets as she had difficulty walking and could not negotiate the stairs down to the lower deck toilets. The message from the senior cabin crew before take off was unlike any I have heard before and was aggressive and abrupt. We were asked to pack the waste materials into the box containing our food as neatly as possible over the PA system - when they were collected the Stewardess emptied them into a bin bag. The whole of the crew demeanour was unwelcoming and any request was met with a sneer or raised eyebrows. One particular member of the crew was negotiating the Duty Free trolley down the aisle and I heard her say "if something is out of stock on the way out it's likely that it'll be out of stock on the way back". Our flights were 2 weeks apart so why should the passenger know the plane had not been restocked? It seems there was some kind of conflict between various members of the crew which came across as very poor service to the passengers. The Cabin Crew just seemed uninterested - I and my family and friends will never ever travel this Airline again.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
Flight to Tunisia on time and no problems boarding. Remember this is a cheap (ish) airline so won't have infinite legroom between seats however if you understand this before you bored the plane then you will have no problems. Cabin crew try to sell but simply decline and they will leave you be. Pilots keep you updated and even joke at times. The 757 interior is a little worn but the fleet is being replaced so this doesn't matter as much anymore. Overall if you understand this is just a cheapish airline with mediocre seat space then you will get on fine!

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
Check-in was very good. The woman who dealt with us was very personable. However the mood changed when I walked on to the plane and saw how closely positioned the seats were. I had read previous complaints about the legroom from passengers that were 5' 2" (I'm 6' 2") so I wasn't expecting to be able to stretch out but I was still taken aback by just how close the seats were. Flight was significantly uncomfortable because of this and many people stood up during the flight. Plane was a 757. Cabin crew were very pleasant however they did attempt to sell various silly things throughout the flight. Flight duration was 4.5 hours and any longer would've become quite unbearable. Flight back was delayed 1 hr 45 mins but being a night flight it was very quiet and seemed more comfortable. Plenty of empty seats on the return and the crew allowed passengers to move where they wished once the flight was at a certain height. The film only had sound up to row 20 and the aroma from the food made you wonder what it actually was. The expensive drinks bad food hard sell and a film without sound I can easily live with but the leg room is a major issue and cannot be ignored when reviewing this airline. It made the journey quite uncomfortable and because of this issue I would recommend others to find an alternative if possible.

Travelled in a party of 9 from Manchester to Malta in July flying on a B767. Departed on time with regular updates from the flight deck. My only complaint on the outbound flight was the breakfast wasn't very nice. We travelled back on the same aircraft again we boarded on time at Malta there was no air conditioning unit attached to the aircraft so once onboard we noticed the heat straight away. This wasn't an immediate issue though as the Captain advised us we would soon be departing. Baggage handlers caused an initial delay of around 40 minutes. Aircraft was becoming hotter by the minute to the point of being unbearable drinks were distributed by the Cabin Crew which was welcomed. Captain decided until the problem could be fixed we'd disembark the aircraft to the comfort of the airport departure lounge which was obviously air conditioned. After 2 hours the fault was fixed and we were welcomed back on board by the crew. Took off and apart from some thunder storms over Manchester and some heavy turbulence the flight was uneventful. Flight deck provided regular updates and cabin crew were attentive. I've flown many times with TCX over the years and as long as you don't go expecting Emirates style service etc on a short/medium haul flight then I don't know how you can be disappointed with them. Final note - inbound meal much better IFE working on both sectors and a camera pitched underneath the aircraft so you could watch the flight if you wished.

Our Vegas to Manchester flight was delayed by over 24 hours. TC reps nowhere to be seen or heard to offer any explanation in direct contrast to our first day in Vegas when they were all over us like a rash trying to sell us their various over-priced packages to Hoover Dam and Grand Canyon etc. We were put up in a decent hotel but there was a five hour wait for coaches to take us to it so nearly all of the passengers took taxis instead. We shall never use them again.

Flown with Thomas Cook twice this year to Cancun in Mexico and to Hurgurda in Egypt. Both experiences were poor and whilst the service on this airline is tolerable for short distances its not on long haul. The Mexico flight was cold and the headset socket did not work. On the Hurgurda flight It was again cold the food was poor (mine was beef without the gravy) the crew constantly chatted to each other. It took forever for them to serve people and ignored the call lights. The only reason to choose them is they fly from Manchester and the cost. Lastly I doubt a top airlines welcome to the flight is that if you get drunk they will refuse to serve you and take action. Both right but it sets a poor tone right from the start to mention it I doubt Etihad do that?

Just returned from a holiday in Majorca flight to Palma Airport was delayed. The cabin crew showed no interest in passengers just stood chatting.

Flew from Gatwick to Dalaman and wish I had booked with another operator. Seat space / leg room should be investigated as to whether it meets legal requirements. Incredibly uncomfortable journey with TC maximising their profit absolutely anyway they could. Return journey was considerably worse because of a systems failure at Dalaman. For good measure some TC rep asked if we were flying to Manchester. Cannot figure out why because we were in the Gatwick queue and curiously there were no flights to Manchester at that time! Upon arrival at Gatwick we had to wait 45 minutes on the plane because stairs were not available to offload us! Apparently this was down to the rain we had earlier in the day. The final nonsense was when we had to wait another 45 minutes for our luggage to emerge. So from landing to luggage collection took 1.5 hours and bear in mind the flight was late because of the problems at Turkey. Seems Servisair who administer ground services at Gatwick were culpable in all this and have not done TC any favours. Together they have persuaded me to use another carrier in future. As for Gatwick thinking it can handle a second runway it is sadly mistaken when patently cannot even handle one!

I have come back from Cuba having pre booked my seats booked extra legroom going out and upgraded to premium seats coming back. When I was checking in at Manchester they told me I shouldn't have been issued this seat and couldn't have that seat. Coming back I had to wait until nearly everyone had checked in to be told I couldn't have the seat that I had paid extra for. This was my first package holiday with Thomas Cook and will be my last.

Flight out from Glasgow was supposed to depart at 16.35 on 4th July 2013 but were told bluntly during check in that there should be further updates at 7pm. No staff available for updates and garbled announcements from Glasgow airports world class PA system. Eventually we managed to get an explanation of sorts from a TC manager at around 9.30pm (5 hour delay). Everyone was just glad we were finally on our way to Antalya but the staff of TC really love rubbing salt in your wounds. Will not use again.

Flew TCX1054 Gatwick to Corfu and TCX 1055 Corfu to Gatwick end of June early July 2013 travelling as a family of 4 (2 adults 2 kids). Both flights ran on time with no problems and overall flights were comfortable. Amazed at how quickly TCX can board a plane. Seats are a bit cramped but the planes were clean. This airline is all about the extra revenue from onboard sales and pre-flight sales - drinks snacks duty free bingo cards meals seat selection. Was disappointed that there was little to no free beverage service. Cabin crew were friendly and attentive. No in flight entertainment but given it was only a 2 hr 45 min flight - we were ok. Two main complaints. 1) Extra baggage fee. I tried to check-in on line the night before and add an extra bag for £19 and it wouldn't let me check-in on line so I though I could just deal with it at Gatwick. When I did they told me the fee was now £60 as it was considered excess baggage at check-in! 2) Baggage retrieval at Gatwick. Not sure if this was TCX's fault or not but we landed in Gatwick early and waited 1.5 hours to get our bags.

We were put on this 5.5 flight to Hurghada. Food was disgusting omelette sausage and congealed baked beans dry bread roll (no butter) and this is supposed to be James Martin cuisine! To top it all every passenger got given the food even if they had not paid for it. Children did not even get child's meal they got the same. Plane was not clean and was the worst flight ever. The outbound flight was with Titan Airlines not Thomas Cook as we booked. Homeward flight was with Thomas Cook and was much better. We travelled out on 2 July 2013 for 1 week. My daughter flew out the week before and had similar issues.

Manchester - Kefalonia - Manchester June 2013. Both outbound and return flights left on time. I pre-booked extra leg room seats and these were allocated on check in as per my booking. The 757-200 aircraft was slightly old inside but with leather seats. Crew were polite efficient and very friendly with passengers. I would imagine that had I not booked extra leg room seats it would be a less comfortable flight but really if you have that much of an issue with leg room simply pay £25 for a seat with extra room and enjoy the flight rather than moan about it. There was one bar service each way but the crew would also get drinks for passengers on request later in the flight so everyone was happy. We had meals included for free as part of our holiday package. Outbound was a choice of Tikka Masala or Beef Bourguignon and return was Tarragon Chicken or Roast Beef. They have been created by Chef James Martin and whilst they were OK I wouldn't be impressed if I had paid for these meals pretty basic. A small selection of TV programmes were show on overhead screens but I didn't watch these as the flight was only 3 hours. Overall excellent flights on Thomas Cook. Hopefully when their new aircraft arrive over the next few years to replace older aircraft the cabin will feel more up to date.

Outbound: Gatwick - Sharm TCX1952 9 Apr 13. Return: Sharm - Gatwick TCX1953 16 Apr 13. Never again Thomas Cook never again. Last year due to work and luckily for me 4 holidays l flew 38 international flights using BA Emirates to EasyJet and Ryanair. At the bottom of the pile is Thomas Cook. Cramped beyond belief my knees jammed against and under the seat in front of me for a 5.5hr flight from LGW to Sharm. They have even moved the magazine rack so its level with your face just so they can gain another inch so your knees are actually embedded into the sest in front of you. No IFE food worst than McD's no free water and FA who treated you no better than cattle. And they call it shorthaul. Looking at going to Florida next year won't be with Thomas Cook that's for sure. The most awful service l have experienced.

2 hours late out of Gatwick to Antalya due to faulty door. Return flight 9 hours late. Was it a coincidence airbus not available after incident at Manchester earlier in week. Felt sorry for reps at airport as they were kept in dark. Why not tell pax the truth and company would get less hassle. Pax split between two aircraft. Replacement aircraft operated by Titan who were excellent. Thomas Cook didn't seem to care. Will think very carefully before flying Thomas Cook again.

Flight from Bulgaria to Glasgow 25th June 2013. First got to leave early due to all passengers on the plane so very pleased arrived back home 45 minutes earlier than expected. Got extra legroom seats at the front of the cabin this was the middle of the night and the plane was freezing when asked if they had a blanket or something I could purchase was told "no" that was it. I can deal with cold weather but my feet arms and face were almost blue it was the security at passport control that asked if I was okay. I asked then if I could move seat due to the plane not being busy but was told no due to safety that is all fair and well but bring ice cold on a plane isn't the best thing. Never again will I be travelling with Thomas Cook Airlines and will definitely not recommend to a friend.

Flew Manchester to Lanzarote and back in May 2013. Two excellent flights both on time. Cabin crew were very friendly and helpful inflight meals were great and plenty of leg space. The only down side is limited entertainment on short haul flights. I've no idea why people seem to complain about some of the things mentioned in other reviews. I've flown with TC several times now and will continue to do so.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
13th June Manchester to Palma. Departure slightly delayed due to volume of traffic at MAN. I opted for an 'adult bundle' of hold baggage seat selection and meal. I'd printed out my boarding card so used bag drop at a heaving Manchester Terminal 1 - very quick and easy. The cost of this was a lot more reasonable than charges which would have been levied by other airlines (low cost). Meal was excellent cabin service and sales not too intrusive. It's been a long time since I've used a traditional charter carrier I will certainly do so again.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
7 June Outward journey to Antalya delayed eventually travellers divided into 2 smaller planes first flight out delayed over 5 hrs second nearer to 8hrs. Total chaos luggage loaded but no relationship to travellers on flight. Poor communication at Gatwick tannoy announcements could not be heard. Nobody at Antalya to assist reps made the excuse that they couldn't access airside but really didn't bother. Luggage arrived late on the 8th. Return journey not much better 3 hrs late despite assurances no delay. Final straw luggage delayed well over an 90 mins with some excuse relating to off line activity whatever that means.

Flew from East Midlands on TCX5894 to Dalaman on 15th June. We added extra legroom for first time which was great. Last year we flew on 757 and the seats were so close together it was uncomfortable. We boarded the plane and the locker above our seats was for airline equipment so I asked the stewardess where I could put my bags she was very abrupt and told me to put it into the locker adjacent to the other one. I found her attitude throughout the flight quite rude and as if she didn't want to be there? She was quite short 5ft 2ins approx. To be honest I found the whole team to be quite "glum". Having said that on the way back on TCX 5895 from Dalaman on 23rd June the team were so different and very friendly.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
8th June Manchester to Antalya TCX2538. 15th June Antalya to Manchester TCX2539. Just used Thomas Cook to fly to Turkey and back absolutely disgusted at how dirty the plane was old food between the seats and by old and mean months old food in the gaps on the floor I opened my table and more food! Staff great pilot - perfect flight great take off and landing both ways but I couldn't get past the filth! Will never fly Thomas Cook again!

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
Flight from Manchester to Cancun delayed just over 24hours! Nobody from TC at airport. Given small value vouchers through the day to cover drinks but not of sufficient value to cover a decent meal in the airport. Eventually told flight will tomorrow and had to collect baggage and board coaches for overnight stay. Transported to wrong premier travel inn in Manchester for overnight stay. Nobody from TC on coaches or at Premier Travel Inn. Limited food and no drinks included although we were supposed to be all inclusive. Flight following was still 25 minutes later than scheduled for takeoff. We were given one free drink on the airplane in compensation. Once we were at the destination we had an excellent holiday and would recommend it!

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
Nightmare start to 10 day holiday with a 2 year old. Glasgow to Dalaman flight initially delayed 6 hours. Replacement aircraft chartered to fly. After waiting for 2 hours at departure gate waiting to board buggies had been taken away informed that the replacement plane wasn't licensed to fly in Turkish airspace! Flight cancelled to next morning at 8.40. Vouchers offered but very few outlets in the airport accepted them. No overnight accommodation was offered no Thomas Cook rep was available. A few people on a 7 day break gave up and went home. Absolutely shocking treatment from Thomas Cook. Will never fly with them again.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
Awful start to our long awaited holiday. 3 hour delay at Gatwick with very little apology and no complimentary drinks or anything onboard by way of an apology. 3 hour delay again on our return flight from Antalya. Leg room is atrocious on Thomas Cook planes. Will never fly Thomas Cook again.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
Stansted to Antalya on an Airbus A320. Both outward and return flights left on time. Pilots were informative and cabin crew pleasant enough. Meal OK. Wouldn't mind more legroom but for a 4hr flight it wasn't really too bad. No complaints.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
Travelling from Birmingham to Heraklion. Uncomfortable seats limited leg room crackling CRT televisions delayed flights booming announcements through PA system at 3am when kids are sleeping chaos at the airport the list goes on. Last trip with TC.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
Flew from Manchester to Sanford America and returned 2 weeks after. On our outgoing flight it was delayed over 2 hours when finally seated on the plane we were offered one complementary drink due to the delay on other long haul flights we have had complementary drinks throughout the flight. The televisions showed the same shows in the long time we were on the flight and had long breaks in-between shows where nothing could be watched. Travelling with two children is difficult any way but when flying long haul it would be nice to have something to entertain them. on our return flight again same problem with the televisions. We flew overnight and was given one pillow and blanket between three.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
Well Thomas Cook you have surpassed yourself this time. Not only did you manage to delay our holiday from Glasgow to Dalaman by 8 hours on 22 May 2013 and having to bus down to Manchester to get our flight out. Now on our return journey on 3/4 June 2013 we turned up at Dalaman airport at midnight to be told that our flight back to Glasgow TCX3876 was going to be delayed by 5 hours. Now we have been informed that in fact it is going to be delayed by 14 hours. The Doncaster flight and the Newcastle flight have also been massively delayed. Absolutely shocking.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
We left from Sanford Florida to Glasgow Scotland and sat in the economy seats on the way over and were annoyed the entire flight by cramped seats and screaming kids. The airline should stop nickel and diming the customers and at least offer them water if they need it. On our returning flight we opted for an upgrade in seating which cost around 300 USD and what a joke. We were graced in the cabin with screaming kids who were kicking the back of our seats for the better half of an eight hour flight. This will be our last flight with this airline.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
Manchester to Bodrum return. Check in at Manchester terrible. Up to 21 Thomas Cook check in desks but only 2 were open for general check-in. Unable to check in online as the fee is £7.50 per person! Both flights were around 1 hour late departing. Seats are very cramped. No complimentary food or drink. No in flight entertainment. Focus of staff is to sell as much duty free and refreshments as possible.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
Glasgow to Dalaman on 18/05/2013 worst experience of flying in 14 years. Have used TC on numerous occasions but never again. Flight delayed 2.5 hours going out most uncomfortable seats I have ever had the displeasure of using. Flights delayed 40 mins on the way back this was a night flight but used the table to sleep on. Flight attendant in charge seemed very offhand verging on rude. Again as I said will never use TC again.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
There is only one possible good reason for flying with TC and that would be if there was no other alternative company available. I paid for extra for leg room and got less than the already cramped seat room my fellow passengers had to endure. The stewardess on the outward journey was very defensive when I pointed the fact out and seemed to enjoy speaking in a loud voice that she was 'doing her best for me'. Thankfully another passenger came to my aid and told her I'd said nothing unreasonable. For the record I'm referring to seats in row 1. The food well James Martin should be made to eat it himself as punishment for putting his name to it. Do not complete the feedback questionnaire on your return journey not unless you want to receive a host of unsolicited mail and nuisance phone calls.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
Have flown with Thomas Cook in the past but don't remember it being as bad as recently. The food on the return flight was terrible. No room in the seat. Plane wasn't particularly clean. Will avoid travelling with TC again at all costs.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
Flew Faro-Gatwick and paid for extra leg room seats definitely worth it looking at the rather cramped space in the standard seats. The pre-booked meal (devised by Chef James Martin) was very good; tender chicken with vegetables orange marmalade pudding & cheese/biscuits. Crew were friendly. It was not possible to do online check in however we timed it well as there was no queue at the check in desks.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
Never will I use this airline again! Travelled to Cancun on 1st May 2013 and I paid for pre-booked window seats and I had no window. What a waste. The seats were so narrow and cramped and I'm average size not overweight. Most uncomfortable flight I've had. Even Ryanair short haul is preferable to this. I cannot believe a long haul flight is bad. Going home tomorrow and dreading the flight back. Oh and NO entertainment. What a nightmare. I travel a lot but will never use this company again.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
MAN-LAS return on an A330-200. Couldn't do advance check in on this route meaning we had to queue for half an hour. We booked the seat allocation meal and baggage bundle and this was honoured. I was annoyed about the way that Thomas Cook try to charge for everything on long haul I don't think it's too much to expect checked baggage included and a meal. They only give 5 kg hand baggage. Moreover the checked baggage is pretty expensive given that they only give you 20 kg. Onboard it was sad to see how tatty it was. The leather on the seats is cracked ripped and generally worn. My seat had a metal bar just under the foam that was really uncomfortable. Leg room was pretty good and I'm 6ft and this is about the most positive thing I can say about the interior. Meals were small and of average quality certainly not worth the cost. Free drinks given with the meal only. Tea or coffee or juice. If you want water the cabin crew have to go back to the galley to get it. The crew were good though it was a shame that they spent so long on the tannoy system trying to sell things like drinks duty free head phones comfort packs bingo cards etc. Not much peace to be had in the first 3 hours of the flight. Entertainment was good given the quality of the airline. Not on demand but 8 channels of films dramas documentaries kids TV etc. On the way out we could look through cameras in the front and bottom of the plane during take off and landing. Not available on the way back. Overall with all the extras (food baggage and seat allocation) the cost of this flight was only marginally cheaper than Virgin Atlantic and in future I'd go Virgin.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
Very disappointed with the service from Thomas Cook Airlines. They left a plane load of Belfast bound passengers delayed in Tenerife Airport for 7.5 hours on Friday 17 May. When we eventually boarded the Captain apologised for the delay and then said that we should appreciate that the staff came in on rest days to get us home. I thought we paid Thomas Cook to bring us home and it was due to a good will gesture from the staff!! I hope I never have to use Thomas Cook again.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
Both outbound and inbound flights from Belfast International to Las Palmas were on time and the cabin staff were very attentive and good. My only gripe was the seat pitch and legroom for a 4.5 hr flight which was uncomfortable & made worse by inconsiderate people in front reclining their seats back.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
Arrecife (Lanzarote) to Glasgow on a Boeing 757-300. We had booked extra legroom seats which I've noticed are much more generous than those on the 757-200 which is a smaller plane. Flight left on time cabin crew were friendly & helpful pilot kept us informed and all in all it was a pretty good flight. My only gripe is with the miserable 5kg hand-luggage allowance policy. Even Ryanair (allow more)!

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
Just back from Gran Canaria having flown Flythomascook. Outbound flight was OK but inbound had been subcontracted to another airline. Delayed 2 hours. Off hand crew and just very poor experience. I fly this route 5/6 times a year and usually use easyjet who are far superior. Will never use Thomas Cook again.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
Family of 6 flying from Manchester to Sanford and return in May 2013. This flight should have been our first flight on a Dreamliner but flight was on 767. Flight was on time outbound and inbound entertainment was poor as headphones useless (we were told none available on return as we should have kept the ones given on outward flight). I had to fold cardboard to support screen and games did not load. The Daily Mail was loaded but not distributed despite my request. Food was inedible (tough cold chicken out and back). Breakfast was a cold Sarah Lee Apple Pie. Staff collected rubbish by dragging a waste sack down and no effort was made to collect waste. I received better staff service on so called "budget airlines" in Europe. Staff had new "Dreamliner uniforms" and Sanford has a huge welcome sign saying Welcome to Thompsons Dreamliner (once enthusiastic customer but now not sure).

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
The booking in was normal. When we entered the aircraft we were horrified to see the tiny aisles and the equally tiny legroom and width of the seats. Neither of us are large and it was not a comfortable flight. Plane was very basic. Staff were fine. The day after our arrival we were informed that the early evening flight we had booked had been bumped forward 4 hours and we now were flying at 23.30. We asked if we could change to another flight and were prepared to fly out a day or two earlier but were told we would have to lose the money on the booked flight and pay the full fare for the second flight. No flexibility at all. On the return flight there were lots of families and some had been at the airport since the earlier time as they had not been informed of the change. After half an hour in the air we had to come back due to engine problems. We all disembarked collected our luggage and were quickly herded out of the airport as it was closed. Waited outside the airport with no seating and no amenities for approx 2 hours for the coaches to turn up and take us to hotels for the night. With a few seats a bottle of water and some good customer care skills it could have been so different! The hotels were fine and the rules were adhered too. The total delay was 23.5 hours. I would not fly with them again.

San Francisco to Heathrow flight booked in Aug 2012 arrived at airport March 1 2013. However no flight flight was cancelled in Oct 12 but no notification to us. No help / assistance offered. On return home battle for compensation. They say 'its your responsibility to check flight 72 hrs prior to flight'.

MAN-Las Vegas-MAN. We flew on an A330 aircraft. We arrived at check in very early but they were unable to seat our party of 3 together. In fact most of the rear 30 rows were split up unless you had pre-booked your seats and paid extra. The cynic in me says they do this purposely to get you to pre-book seats next time. Strangely on our return everyone appeared sat together with their parties. The entertainment system appears quite old and had several vision and sound problems. 4 movies out and 3 in. Seats were fairly hard. The food was standard airline quality. Going long haul again I would rather fly with a different airline.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
Just returned from Cuba. Very worried about flying with Thomas Cook due to poor reviews but was very pleasantly surprised outbound and inbound flights both on time returning we were 2 hours faster. We booked bulkhead seats which were worth the money although seats slightly narrow the food was excellent both ways hot and tasty. The plane was clean and tidy and the staff were attentive and friendly. No concerns about using them again.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
I've been flying with Thomas cook for many years now and not had a bad experience yet. I'm 6/2 and although legroom is on the tight side its manageable. I'd choose not to have the set inflight meal and rather choose from the menu. The hot meals from the menu's although not massive are tasty. Always found the crew to be happy and helpful.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
I traveled from Copenhagen to Thailand on a long 11 hour trip. Seats are quite narrow for such a long journey though you do have a personal screen to watch movies. You have to pay for drinks staff will wake up with loud announcements to try to sell you things. Buy a large bottle of water or two in the airport before going in! It's not the best for long trips!

Was travelling on flight TCX 4013 Larnaca to Birmingham on 10th April 2013. I asked and paid for extra legroom at 21 euro's per seat (booked at check in desk at Larnaca). I was allocated seat 2b which when I got to it is far from extra legroom. I am 6'4" and knee's only just free of bulkhead of toilet and could not adjust feet very cramped. Thanks to crew prompt action got me into seat 11E. My experience of Thomas Cook 757's is that extra leg room is in rows 11 and 31. I don't blame Thomas Cook it seems strange that original passengers in row 11 did not pay for extra leg room were about 5'6" tall. Beware of Larnaca check in staff.

Flew from Newcastle to Palma and return last summer delayed both ways miserly 5 euro voucher for 8 hour delay. Staff off hand to the point of rudeness catering poor seats dirty cramped seating. Wouldn't use them again.

My return flight from Goa on TCX319 GOI-LGW was as far as flight service is concerned as good as my experience on the outbound flight the week earlier. Another excellent team of cabin crew who remained friendly and happy despite the 10.5h night flight back to the UK. This time we had paid to upgrade to the "Premium" cabin and to allocate our seats in advance. I thought this well worth the small additional premium. Cabin service is however the same throughout the aircraft. In-flight meals again very nice. Whilst this was an A330-200 aircraft it was a different registration to the outbound flight and I can't score the interior as well. My Premium seat was old leather ripped and the bottom padding worn out. A shame that the interiors of these aircraft are so old and tatty - definitely need an update TC! Crew great meals great. In-flight entertainment fair to poor aircraft needs a deep clean and refurbish.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
Flew TCX318 LGW-GOI on one of their A330-200 aircraft. Fortunate to be in the "Premium" section (more by luck as you can't book this ex-UK due to the excessive APD taxes) and seat and leg room good. Having walked around the cabin even the regular economy seating seemed to have plenty of leg room. Aircraft interior somewhat worn and in-flight entertainment not as up to date as most airlines these days but not sure this is too much of a problem for most these days as many passengers travel with I-PAD's and alike. Cabin crew and in-flight service very good as were the meals.

I took my wife and my Mother and Father on Holiday from Manchester-Larnaca flying outbound 17th June 2012 and flying Inbound 1st July 2012. We got to the check-in desks of Terminal 1 to be told that there was a delay expected of 3 hours on departure due to waiting for the inbound aircraft to arrive. Flew on Boeing 767-300 series aircraft with winglets and once onboard I was surprised to see the wonderful seating almost of a leather type feel to them. I am not exactly short in height being 6ft 2in but I was surprised to be able to move my legs quite freely without touching the seats in front. The cabin crew were helpful. The pre-booked in-flight meals were quite tasty but could have done with jazzing up a little. I didn't manage to catch the in- flight entertainment as the interruptions to the film from over the tannoy were often and noisy. However on the way back I found it interesting to see they had no films showing and just an intermittent update of flight information and map displaying location over the globe of the flight itself. Overall a very good experience.

My husband and I travelled from Bristol to Paphos Cyprus last September. Aircraft seats were very cramped with little legroom. Return flight was a nightmare. Halfway through the flight the captain announced that the aircraft was being diverted to Cardiff due to "operations systems". The plane was needed at Cardiff to return to Cyprus. We were then coached back to Bristol adding nearly 3 hours to our journey. We have since learned that these diversions are a regular occurrence with Thomas Cook flights. This is the last time we will ever use Thomas Cook.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
Manchester to Banjul The Gambia and return flight time was 6 hours. Worst flight I have ever been on. Aircraft used was a B757-200 which seemed to be the oldest in their fleet. Legroom was a very poor 28 inches. Flight entertainment was very poor. I had pre paid for inflight meals and they were not worth the money paid. Flight going out was on time but return flight had a 2.5 hour delay. Cabin crew seemed to want to sell as much stuff as possible.

Flew Thomas Cook A330-200 Gatwick-Cancun - will never use again poor leg room - only long haul flight I have had to pay for drinks on. Inflight entertainment very poor. Paid £40 in total to select seats booked with a window as stated on seat map when choosing got there and there was no window!

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
Very pleasantly surprised. Flew MAN-TFS on 757-200. Smooth check-in very friendly cabin crew good meal and bar service. Return on A321 once again good meal cabin crew keen to oblige and all in all very satisfied. Only negative was that a passenger fell ill requiring oxygen and two female cabin crew members were superb in dealing with the emergency. The Cabin Crew Manager carried on with his Duty Free selling and offered no help at all to the other crew members. I know Duty Free sales are important to airlines but the safety of passengers should be of paramount importance. This marred what otherwise was a very pleasant charter flight.

Manchester-Cayo Coco (Cuba) out 18/1/13 return 01/02/13. Couldn't complain about flight crew and service - excellent on aircraft both ways. Near enough on time both sectors. We paid extra for leg room - well worth the £40. Only setback was the inflight entertainment was poor. Would I fly Thomas cook again? Yes but would pay the extra for legroom due to long flight.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
My wife and I flew from Belfast to Lanzarote on January 24 2013 and returned on Jan 31 2013. Flight from Belfast was on time and no problems boarding. First thing we noticed on boarding was the narrow space between the seats other passengers commented on this. When I sat down the space to the next seat was so narrow that I was unable to put the food tray down flat. I am 5 ft 5 and found that I was cramped. Other passengers who were taller than I experienced greater discomfort. There was also a lack of overhead storage for all passengers and some had to shove baggage between their legs. On the return journey we were collected from our hotel 20 minutes late. Wen we got to the airport Thomas Cook had 6 check in desks open for people boarding 4 of their flights all leaving within 15 minutes of each other. 4 desks were open for speedy boarding and Thomas Cook were actively trying to sell this service to people in the queue. As a consequence we had little time in the airport to have lunch or shop before boarding. When the plane took off and the set belt sign was switched off most passengers stood for the 4 hour journey. I have travelled with Thomas Cook in the past but their service has declined and they seem to be preoccupied with getting more and more money from passengers. As a seasoned traveller I have never seen such cramped conditions on any plane including so called budget airlines. I will never travel with Thomas Cook again and would not recommend this company to anyone.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
Tenerife from Manchester in June 2012 for 2 weeks. Outward was fantastic new style seats made extra legroom after a fantastic holiday with my family we returned to the airport making sure we arrived in plenty of time 3 hours! When we arrived at check-in the man said there was some sort of problem with flight and left us stood there for 1.5 hours when we were finally told there was a delay and to move to a queue further down the line where we ended up for another 2 hours. Finally told our flight wasn't leaving until late that night instead of lunch time and given a small food voucher. Ended up sitting around the airport for a total of 10 hours and departed at approx 8pm. Got back to Manchester well after midnight on a plane that was falling apart too hot and very discourteous staff. If they had told us about this earlier we could have re- booked a car and enjoyed the day as we were flight only and not part of a package holiday we wouldn't be entitled to any compensation anyway! I think it was disgusting the way we were all treated especially with a young child to keep entertained in a small airport with not much to do. Will not be Flying with Thomas Cook again!

LGW-ACE-LGW. Recently used TC to visit relatives in Lanzarote. Booked the flight online with the added items I desired. Arrived Gatwick early and used their baggage drop service excellent. Flight out A321 was ok I had been advised a few months earlier that the aircraft type had been changed but my seat booking was still valid. Cabin staff excellent nothing was to much trouble for them. Flight back via Boeing 757 again used TC baggage drop facilities so missed the usual long queue's. Found the flight to be very good and again found the cabin crew to be very good service excellent. Would definitely use TC again.

We went to Mexico from Gatwick on 5 December. Flight delayed 2 hours - both sides to and from - but mostly the seats were so awful. Customer satisfaction was poor and the TC aircraft's must be revamped to improve the overall travelling experience. The actual holiday was great. Awful seats incredibly small seat width. The worst I have experienced by far.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
Had such a wonderful holiday Christmas in Lanzarote. On our return due to an issue back at Manchester we were informed that the plane allocated was different to the scheduled aircraft. Pre-booked seats were meaningless. Flight took off in it's customary late fashion. Due to the passenger in front reclining his seat I found myself wedged between the planes window port and the seat headrest. My wife had to quickly tell the occupier of the seat to ease up. The maintenance of an aircraft is paramount however the maintenance of its passengers is another question.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
Flight time was altered before we set off and several travelers were not informed - ourselves included so only just caught plane which got as far as Belfast before turning back to Manchester because of engine problems. Put in hotel for night and off we go next morning. On way back stuck in Cancun airport for over 9 hours getting various pieces of information the one I liked best was we were stuck there because the Mexican Government had changed that weekend and there was no-one to sign papers! Eventually took off 51 hours late reps from the company were useless. I will definitely travel with another company if at all possible.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
Manchester - Cancun (1st December). Flight delayed an hour but we had been informed of this by TC about 2 months previously that this would be the case so this was no problem. We pre booked seats both outbound and inbound and after reading other people's reviews about these pre paid seats not being kept I was worrying although I had no reason to as everything was fine. The plane an Airbus A330 was in good condition the seats were comfortable with plenty of leg room the cabin crew were friendly the entertainment was good and helped pass the time and the food was decent quality. Flight back was on time we had very good tail wind which knocked off a good 1-1.5 hrs off the flight. Food was good again as was the entertainment. The cabin crew were perhaps not as attentive coming back but this was only a minor snag and it didn't ruin our flight by any means. After reading so many bad reviews I had feared the worst but we had two very pleasant flights with them and would fly again.

Manchester - Cancun 17th November. Flight delayed an hour got as far as Belfast before one engine lost power. Captain had to dump fuel and make emergency landing back at Manchester. 24 hour delay and flew out next day. Cancun to Manchester on 1st December delayed by 6 hours before being told that "Thomas Cook hadn't paid the Mexican Authorities". Airport grounded the Manchester and Gatwick flight for 48 hours - flew home on the 3rd December. A330 aircraft are dated entertainment system didn't work for a few hours on the outbound it's on a loop and so no on demand entertainment. Food was awful service poor and a shambles. The inbound flight had an extra crew member on it as one stewardess had got on the Manchester flight and not the Gatwick!

Flew Gatwick to Cancun the worst flight I have ever been on. One and half hour delay going out and coming back no reason given it was just accept it and that's it. Cabin crew scruffy and more interested in speaking to each other about what they did the previous evening laying over the trolley giggling. Awful service. No one seemed in charge No one cared about the passengers except when they were trying to sell something. The aircraft was tatty not very clean tatty magazines. Inflight film kept cutting out even after having to pay 2.75 for the adapter. For a 11.5 hour flight. The leg room was minimal and uncomfortable.

Flew to Larnaca in July. Delayed 24 hours on the outbound leg as plane had a technical problem. Virtually non existent information and passengers pretty much left to use word of mouth to get bussed to hotels as only one member of airport staff (Glasgow) was out helping at the bus pick up points (which was like something out of a Carry On Film - total chaos) as the Thomas Cook staff invisible. Flight next day on different plane - horrible old plane no legroom overpriced snacks. Got form at Larnaca saying claim off your insurance. Reading through other posts this airline seems to be going downhill very fast. Another customer lost.

Have travelled with Thomas Cook on several occasions and found their flights to be very good however having travelled to Fuerteventura I have noticed a big change in standards. The seats and tray areas were very dirty and the seat pitch was tiny. The aircraft itself was very old and dated. Flight was delayed on way back with no explanation. Staff were okay although did have to ask for a lap belt for my 7 month old son. Not sure I would fly with Thomas Cook again.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
We flew to Fuerteventura for Oct half term. Flight out was ok but the flight back TCX6335 was delayed for 23 hours due to a technical fault. Having sat on the tarmac for 2 hours we were sent to a shabby hotel for the night. Children on the flight back had to pay for earphones despite the horrendous delay. This is not the way to treat your customers. We will not book with Thomas Cook again. Finally got home at 2am on Monday morning when we should have been back on Saturday night.

Scuba Equipment. I noticed on the website that if you show your diving log book you get 5kg extra baggage allowance for scuba gear. I checked in at B'ham airport and the check in staff accepted my diving certificate offhandedly. On check in at Sharm airport I was told I would have to pay for excess baggage over the 20kg limit. Although I quoted the 5kg extra allowance and showed my diving certificate they had no knowledge of it and persisted to charge me. Fortunately I had printed out the terms for scuba equipment from the web- site and only when I produced that did they allow the excess free.

Just returned from TFS from MAN. 4 house delayed because they had an unserviceable aircraft. The planes are old the seating is the worst and service is poor. Ryanair for me.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
TCX2157 Larnaca to Manchester delayed 5 hours - 'flight no longer available for operational reasons'? No-one around to give explanations or apologies. Booked this flight because of good flight times in first place! Food vouchers OK. Arrived back Manchester to then experience further delay disembarking - very slow bussing passengers to terminal bit by bit as 01.30 in morning by now. Then further delay getting baggage - total nightmare. Later found out this flight has appalling on time record!! Will not use TCX again.

Having read page after page after page of poor and negative reviews one might wonder what the point is as there seems to be little done about the recurring complaints but here we go. Memo to Chief executive: "strap yourself into one of your tatty planes sit for 5 hours unable to recline or even move due to the ludicrously tiny space you seem to think is adequate add to that no ventilation oppressive heat and cabin crew more interested in gossip than service and see how you like it". Why do they have to ruin a holiday with such shoddy service!

ACE-LGW. Check in very good with helpful staff. Boarding fairly quick and smooth. B757-300 looked a tad shabby but much more comfortable than Airbus. We had elected to have a pre-booked meal which was quite pleasant. Cabin crew were friendly and professional. A surprisingly good experience.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
Glasgow - Tenerife - Glasgow on a Boeing 757-300. Flights left on time crew friendly enough. Main gripe is the exceptionally mean 5kg hand luggage allowance even the low-cost airlines give you 10kg! We booked an extra-legroom seat and a seat by the emergency exit (this being the same price as a regular seat) both had excellent legroom. Stewardess told us that the emergency exits on the 757-200s don't have as good legroom as the emergency slide sticks out however this is not the case with the 757-300. Meal coming back was OK breakfast going was poor. When purchased as part of the bundle for choose your seat/meals/luggage it works out OK value for money. No in-flight entertainment whatsoever.

LGW to Sanford. Boarded on time then sat on the runway while fixing problem! Left hour late then 3.5 hours into the flight we got redirected to Iceland! No mention of when we would next fly. We had to call the UK to find out what was happening. Finally left the hotel at 1.30pm on the Saturday (landed 5.30pm Friday) to be told we would be flying 16.55 then delayed until 6.30 after boarding sat on the runway for 1hr. Finally arrived in Orlando 2.30 am Sunday morning when we should have landed 2.30 pm Friday! On return flight no reclining seats! Again boarded on time then again some excuse and left yet again an hour late.

We flew Manchester to Tenerife South recently and I must say I wasn't looking forward to it after reading bad reviews. However I must admit we had an excellent experience. We left Manchester on time and arrived back in Manchester half an hour early. We managed to book extra leg room on the return journey which was good but even in the normal seats we had as much leg room as other airlines we have flown with. There was no entertainment on the outward journey but we were treated to a film on the return leg. All in all a stress free experience and I would definitely recommend to family and friends for future travel plans.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
Delayed 3.5 hours with no explanation. Flight times changed twice during the delay. Inflight service was terrible. No drinks offered with dinner you had to ask for them tea and coffee finally came round a good 45 minutes after dinner. No garbage collected. Two babies in front of us were allowed to stand on their mother's knees during take off and landing. Nobody did a pre-take off or landing check to see who had seat belts on. I will never book Thomas Cook/Air Transat again.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
Stansted to Dalaman. Delayed going out by 2 hours even though they boarded us as if we were on time. Flight deck insisted on telling us we were sitting on the plane because they were performing running repairs on landing equipment. The seat pitch was unacceptable so tight and uncomfortable and the flight staff were scruffy and unhelpful. I even had to draw their attention to the state of the loo! Whoever was in charge of the announcements on both flights was dreadful - got all her words mixed up and giggled in the middle of her announcement.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
Outward flight from Gatwick to Orlando delayed 5 hours due to technical problem with Airbus! Return flight from Orlando to Gatwick delayed 25 hours due to technical problem. Premium seats were comfortable. The outward bound food (by chef James Martin) sausage and mash- very good Thai curry - very dry. Return flight food not very good and the breakfast is not worth bothering with may as well just offer fruit juice or a tea/coffee. This is the first time we have flown with Thomas Cook overall experience has not been a good one.

Norwich to Palma on airbus A321 the legroom is shocking. I am 5ft 11 and found it quite uncomfortable. Staff were friendly onboard and the service was good. Will use again providing there is more legroom.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
LGW-LPA-LGW - Very old 757-200 on both legs overhead screens for IFE on the way over but no IFE on the way back. Leg room was an absolute joke! Made worse when the person in front tried putting their seat back and jamming my legs completely in place for 4 hours. Crew were not the greatest and on the way back were too busy talking. Glasgow based crew on the way over far more friendly and chatty to passengers rather than each other. Check in a LGW very good with no wait at the bag drop desk at LGW return check in at LPA only 2 check in desks opened and Thomas Cook wanted an extra €10 to jump up the line waited 50mins to get to the front agent was very chatty and pleasant. Didn't buy anything on board and the food looked quite poor quality. Wouldn't choose to fly with them again I'd rather pay a bit more and fly with a proper airline.

Just returned from two weeks in Florida outbound journey was 5 hours late leaving due to technical problems received a voucher at the airport which was acceptable. Crew on board were very attentive and our 6 year old son was sick they were very helpful. Seats were reasonably comfortable food and entertainment ok. Return journey a different story delayed 25 hours due to technical problems after a wait at the airport with no information as to what was going on we were told to take bits from our cases for an overnight stay taken to a local hotel for the night. Eventually left 25 hours late! The plane was dirty. Crew were not particularly helpful. It was an experience I would not want to go through again and will not fly Thomas Cook ever again!

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
Just had 2 weeks in Florida. The flight out was good staff were excellent and the aircraft an airbus was comfortable with good leg room. Flight back was terrible 3 hour delay with no explanation the seats were very narrow and extremely uncomfortable on this aircraft a Boeing 767 and they did not recline at all. No seat back entertainment just overhead screens in the aisle but this didn't matter because none of the sound sockets controls on the right side of the aircraft worked anyway which is a joke when flying long haul with children. We asked to move but were told we couldn't even though there were empty seats at the rear of the cabin. Very poor.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
Only chose Thomas Cook due to it's preferential flight times to Larnaca. Plane was an old 757-200 it still has the old style televisions hanging out of the ceiling showing one film and desperately old TV shows. You'll need to buy headphones at £2.75. If you do bring your own make sure you get a double pin adapter otherwise you will pay £1.50 for one of those. No personal air conditioning. Return flight was so old and tired that it had no auxiliary power meaning no air conditioning at all when on the ground. The seats are terrible 28" legroom is all that you get which means you spend your flight pinned up against the seat in front of you. Equally the width of the seats is poor too meaning you have to take great care not to knock out the person next to you whenever you move! We only flew as far as Cyprus - I pity anyone who has or will travel any further. The service is okay but is clearly a charter flight style - continually trying to sell something to you. If you haven't paid in advance for food you can buy it on the plane but it is expensive for what it is and pretty mediocre. They don't even give you water tea or coffee during a 4.5 hour flight. In conclusion I will never travel with TCA ever again. I should have listened to the reviews I read before travelling.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
Due to travel back from Tenerife South on 26th Oct 2012. Take off should have been 1.40 instead without explanation it ended up being 01.40 on the 27th Oct. Absolutely no customer service. Updates were by means of the flight board There were 11 changes to the flight time. Ended up on another airline Cosmo brought us to the UK on our return journey. Handed a letter on arrival at Newcastle airport giving the flight details and how to make a claim through our own Insurance Policy.

Flying out to Orlando we were delayed 5 hours when we checked in the night before no mention of any delays however when we looked at the board before our flight it said it had been pushed back 5 hours. Flight itself was horrible small seats no legroom. Inflight entertainment was even worse 3 movies to choose from and you had to start watching at the same time as everyone else. After a lovely holiday in Orlando we were meant to fly at 12.30 given a hotel and our flight is now 17.30 - a delay of 25 hours.

Birmingham to Antalya on 13.10.12. However we had probably 20-25 % children on board and the choice of film for general viewing was poor and was not suitable for kids viewing. Secondly I flipped up a tap on the toilet washbasin to find it was filthy with slime under the head. Obviously a long time since any cleaner had investigated the area. Other than these things the flight went well with all other aspects being ok.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
Travelled TCX4329 from Lanarca to Birmingham. Arrived early at the airport waited to check in and must have been 20th in queue. After experiencing cramped conditions on inward journey asked for extra legroom but none available so asked for aisle and next seat were put on row 30 right next to toilets no leg room and head pushed forward for whole journey. Staff oblivious and unprofessional did not do a last cabin check to make sure every thing stored and seatbelts on - more interested in selling lottery. We paid a lot for flight would now use a low cost airline over TC every time.

TCX6025 Tenerife to Newcastle. Supposed to take off at 13.40. On arrival at airport at 11.30 all seemed well. Called to gate 37 around 1pm. Staff took 4 wheelchairs through and returned with them minutes later. Never at any time informed as to why our flight was cancelled/delayed. Food vouchers were given out but had to be spent in same establishment. Constantly had to visit the information desk to find out what was going on. We eventually left at 01.38am 12 hours late on a Cosmos plane. Customer service needs seriously considered!

TCX2026 Manchester to Paphos on 16 October 2012 delayed 8 hours and the handling of passenger welfare was unacceptable. Flight due to depart at 0700 hrs. On checking in at 0545 we were advised it was still 0900 for a technical problem. Only update was via the departures board which pushed back to 0930 then further information at 1000. A tannoy announced delay until 1400hrs and to collect a £10 refreshment voucher in a queue that took 1 hour. Thomson flight drafted in as replacement - departure now posted at 1430. As boarding given letter of explanation found out that the meal we had prepaid for was not available via Thomson. Letter stated we would be refunded flight meal money on return to UK but now have discovered we have to write in to claim it back. Took off at 1505.

Boeing 757-200 Gatwick to Antalya return. My husband and I returned from Antalya a 4 hour flight at 4am Wednesday (after a 3 hour delay). We had the same problem on our outward journey. The worst thing was the inadequate seating space plus both of our seats had clasped so it was just impossible from the time we sat down to get any comfort. I had a bump on my seat which caused discomfort at the base of my spine. Difficult to eat our meals because of elbow room. We sat in row 40E and F at the back of the aircraft the seats did not tilt back to any degree so we sat bolt upright for the 4 hour night flight! Yes we tried to buy extra leg room on the way back but there was none available. What a shame Thomas Cook! Everything else was just great!

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
No problems with our flight from Stansted to Fuerteventura but on our return flight never before have I encountered such an unprofessional team of stewardesses all making unsuitable jokes and talking to passengers as if they were old mates not to mention using the trolleys as weapons crashing into elbows of passengers etc. We were rudely told we couldn't have the in-flight meal as 'you ain't paid for it you're on a Thomson's holiday' although they did relent under protest. The aisle on the plane was too narrow for a toilet queue.

Manchester to Hurghada on Boeing 757-200 G-FCLH and it was the worst flight I have been on! Sat in window seat 15F. I argued at check-in that although 15F was on the side of the aircraft with windows it did not have one. Boarded the plane seat 15F. No window! I am by no means large neither was the 10 year old who was kicking my seat behind me which could not be helped as he also couldn't move because of the poor legroom. Aircraft was filthy. Flight time from Manchester to Hurghada is usually 5 hrs 35 mins. It was pleasing when the crew said this was to be only 5 hrs 18 mins. In truth the aircraft shut down 5 hrs 50 mins after it had first moved for the purpose of its flight. Will I fly them again? Yes but only because I need to fly home. Lookout for an identical review about Halloween time. Unless they send an A320/A321/A332/A333/B753/B763 to cover the flight instead I don't expect to be happy!

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
Manchester to Dalaman. Outbound flight was on time but that is about the only positive. Aircraft was a 757-200 it was far too old! We had the two seats at the rear of the aircraft 30 C/D. The seats did not recline at all and the legroom was bad. You had to pay for pillows blankets and headsets now. Not that the headset was any good because the TV screens were so small and far away you couldn't see the film. Return flight was almost one hour late taking off. The aisle is so narrow that you were frequently knocked by the trolley. The main problem was the legroom just awful.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
Glasgow-Malta return economy class as part of a Thomas Cook package holiday in Gozo. Outbound flight delayed 30 minutes largely due to the police having to come on board and remove a drunk passenger. Return flight was on time. The aircraft seemed clean and well-prepared but the legroom was pretty restricted (I'm 6'6"). Nonetheless I found it reasonably ok for a 4 hour flight although I wouldn't want to go on a long-haul in these conditions. Staff were friendly and helpful and provided good service. I was particularly impressed by the way in which they dealt with the drunk passenger on the outbound flight and by their announcement on both flights that they would sell alcohol in moderation but reserved the right to refuse it - marked contrast to another airline where we had to sit next to two obnoxious drunks whom the staff kept plying with booze. All in all a perfectly reasonable trip and in view of all the negative reviews that this airline has received I thought it only appropriate to give the other side of the story.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
Flight out to Tenerife bearable but the return was a joke. Party of 20 blind people no priority boarding arranged flight back delayed then diverted to Glasgow "for operational reasons". Cabin staff unhelpful especially manager who stated "if you have a problem see me or the captain when we land and we will call the police". Very diplomatic and calming! Waited over 2 hours for coaches then had to try and arrange homeward travel for 20 disabled travellers at midnight. Unfortunately Thomas Cook Holidays faired little better and were unhelpful and full of undelivered promises.

We travelled to Hurghada from Gatwick on 5th October and returned on 12th October. We had a 4 hour delay on both outward and return flights and was offered a £5 voucher on the outward journey and a couple of stale rolls on the return as compensation. The leg room was virtually non existent on the standard seats but luckily we had pre-booked long legroom seats on the way out at a cost of £30 each extra. The guy sitting next to us who had left the UK 3 weeks before had had a 6 hour delay on the outbound journey and said delay on this airline was normal! Altogether a very unpleasant experience and would never fly Thomas Cook again.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
I flew to Hurghada from Gatwick on 5th of October. The flight was 4.5 hours late leaving (should have been 12.50 left 17.20) we received a £5 food voucher at Gatwick as compensation. The return flight was 3 hours and 26 mins late leaving (should have been 20.10 left 23.36) we received a meal box at Hurghada containing two rolls a small carton of fruit juice and a bottle of water. The aircraft (Boeing 757/200 G-FCLJ both ways) was clean but seat space was fairly tight two inflight movies were shown each way the staff were polite and efficient. Passengers who asked to be seated together on the return flight were distributed randomly around the cabin. This flight from Gatwick to Hurghada and the return seems to be regularly delayed see other posts on this board. I will be a very reluctant passenger on a Thomas Cook flight in the future.

Having travelled to Cyprus with a large wedding party we weren't even sat anywhere near each other on the plane. The planes were old tatty and cramped. At Larnaca airport there was a massive queue to check in so 4 of us decided to part with 40 Euro for express check in. We ended leaving the desk at the same time as our friends who took the long queue. When asking the reps why this is acceptable they advised 'it's the risk you take'.

This was the first (and last) time we had the misfortune of flying with Thomas Cook to Antalya in Turkey from Manchester airport on the 24th September. We were supposed to fly at 07.45am and eventually took off at 22.45 a full 15 hours late . Any information about what was happening was sporadic to say the least. When we realised we would probably arrive at our accommodation in the middle of the night we were given International Phone Cards!! Worth wait for it - 66p. ! ! We had to ask for food vouchers throughout the day which totalled a massive £14 per person. The whole experience was a shocking shambolic mess Oh and to add insult to injury we were also delayed one and a quarter hours on our return flight. Thomas Cook Airways your Customer Service stinks and you should be ashamed of yourselves! Never again.

Flew Manchester to Antalya and back. Hopefully I will never have to fly with Thomas Cook again as it was not a good experience! Flights were booked as part of a package deal. We picked this holiday because it had semi decent flight times (departing 3pm out and 10pm back). When filling in the API online I found that the flight times had been changed to departing at 7pm and 2.30 am. No communication about this from TC. Their response was 'oh you should have had a letter'. Yes I should have but I didn't! Checked in online no queue for bag drop but told flight delayed by 3.5 hours. Then 4 hours. Finally called to gate to be told that although plane is here there is now a technical problem and we'll be updated in an hour. Bearing in mind how long people have been in airport (and some of them drinking) this does not go down well especially as all airport facilities now shut. Eventually boarding commenced and we set off at 12.30 am. The flight was just about bearable - rock hard seats that don't recline and no seat back pouches to hold water etc. As plus point the food was good. Coming back at least we weren't delayed but you can't check in on line for the return flight. We weren't at the back of the queue and we stood in line for 1 1/4 hrs. Same rock hard seats and less leg room - we were on the same row as we flew out on and there was a noticeable difference. The only good thing I can say is at least the luggage arrived.

Travelled Birmingham - Paphos return on one of their ancient 757's and have never experienced such little leg room. My wife stands 5'2" and found the seats cramped as I had an aisle seat I spent most of the time standing on a flight lasting well over 4 hours. When the staff enquired why I was standing for so long I explained the space situation and their lack of interest was underwhelming. Never again.

Quite easily the worst flying experience that I have ever had to endure. I had a flight only deal to Naples. The flight was originally due to take off at 8.30. We were then advised there was a delay until 12.30. We then turned up at the gate with a boarding card to be told we had been put on another flight that would not leave until 16.30. We actually took off at 17.30! We received 2 x £6 vouchers for our inconvenience. We also suffered a 4 hour delay coming back. Lovely. There were 2 couples who had missed connecting flights to Ireland and Scotland who then had to purchase new flights at their own cost. Thanks Thomas Cook for ruining mine and many others holiday.

Flew to Rhodes from Manchester on 22nd September. 5 minutes before gate opened were told we'd have to be bussed to East Midlands. Three 52 seater coaches showed up for over 200 people. Do the maths. When at East Midlands airport flight was delayed for a further 30 minutes. Given £6 vouchers each as compensation. Didn't cover the cost of a coffee and sandwich. Flight back from Rhodes on 29th September was late by over 2 hours. Won't be flying Thomas Cook airlines again.

Flew from Gatwick to Hurghada on 14/09/12 - service was not great - the inflight entertainment was terrible the film was shown on old-style televisions and the picture quality was awful. Food was actually very good for plane-food the leg room was laughable! I'm only 5'5" and my knees were touching the seat in front so I dread to think how it must be for those who are actually tall! The flight back into Gatwick on 25/09/12 was awful - again the leg room was awful the food was not as good. The worst thing was the absolute lack of inflight entertainment - a 5 hour 29 minute flight with no entertainment is a absolute disgrace. Extremely disappointed - would have expected if we had flown with EasyJet or some other budget airline but for an airline such as Thomas Cook this was completely unexpected and very disappointing! Very reluctant to book with Thomas Cook in the future and we have used them for many years.

We have flown Thomas Cook for may years always to Kos this year we were due to leave Kos at 01.10 hrs but were delayed by fog. All incoming flights diverted to Rhodes or Athens we had already given our luggage in prior to the announcement of the delay but the Thomas Cook reps were superb they returned our luggage we were then transferred to a hotel and kept informed of the expected time of departure collected and returned to the airport. On the return flight a meal was given to all passengers free of charge we had already booked our meals but thought it was a very good gesture by the company they did their best under very difficult circumstances. My only complaint is that they are no longer flying to Kos from EMA and as we go there twice a year we are not looking forward having to travel to Manchester as we only live 11 miles from EMA.

We had return flights from Glasgow to Bodrum. I doubt if the person who designed the seats and the pitch has ever had to fly in them. I would rate myself as an experienced traveler but I have never experienced such uncomfortable back breaking seats in any of my travels in addition there is no seat pocket for your personnel items books Ipad iPod Mp3 player water etc. I am afraid after this experience Thomas Cook will be my airline of last choice.

Flew from Gatwick to Hurghada 18/09/2012. Initially delayed by 4 hours which was annoying but not the end of the world. The real horror was to come which was the woeful state of the 757 we would travel in to Egypt. A very old plane with trim filthy or missing. The worst thing was the totally inadequate seating space (I can't bring myself to call it leg room as there was clearly no room for your legs). I am 5'8" and could barely squeeze in the whole experience was so claustrophobic that I am dreading the return flight. The inflight entertainment was laughable with pull down black and white TVs which appear to have been acquired from a 1980's defunct coach fleet the temperature also did not help the overall experience although went some way to acclimatise us to the heat of Egypt. The holiday itself has been fantastic and such a shame to be so spoilt by the flight.

Gatwick-Kalamata out 16th Sep returning 23rd Sept. Going out flight was much to time and smooth journey. Argument beside me when lady decided to recline her seat to dismay of person behind her who I think was still eating. Return journey was originally delayed 1 hour - 'due to late arrival of incoming aircraft' - then extended to approx 4 hours as the aircraft was diverted to Bulgaria to take an engineer and parts to a stranded aircraft. Kalamata airport is small so there were not enough seats and the snack bar ran out of food (eventually they opened the arrival area to accommodate us). We were updated but beyond a complementary drink on board little was done to alleviate the considerable inconvenience. The real drawback of flying Thos Cook is the check-in system. Unless you pay extra for an allocated seat you cannot check-in on-line so have to join the one common queue for all their flights.

BHX-CFU-BHX 757-200 outbound 10th September. Had used online check in so baggage drop was swift and painless. Departed on time cabin clean and tidy cabin crew were friendly and helpful. Seats 31E and F so plenty of legroom although the seats did feel a little narrow. In flight meal good although the gluten free meal could be a little more imaginative. Flight arrived a little early. In bound flight 17th September same aircraft and seats departed on time. Meals good and cabin crew as good as the outward journey flight arrived a little early. All in all a pleasant experience and one I would be happy to repeat.

We used Thomas Cook to fly to Tenerife. (TCX1012 and TCX1013). I am shocked that I can honestly say that I have used 2 other low cost companies and had much better experience than the one I have had this week. I found on flight staff incredibly rude unapproachable and miserable. I am 5ft 4 and my poor other half is 5ft 11 and we were rammed in behind people who reclined their seats (how can there be room for reclining seats when you can't even put arm rest up properly or have enough space to sit comfortably?). This happened on our way out and back! On our way back to Gatwick we had a four hour delay. So our 19.20pm flight didn't leave until 23.20pm. As we were both so uncomfortable neither of us could sleep on plane. So by the time we got to Gatwick at 2:45am we had both been awake for 19hours and had to drive 2 hours to get home. This was such a downer to our Holiday. Will never fly Thomas Cook again.

10 Sep LGW-AYT. On time comfortable seats with plenty of legroom (A330) and tasty inflight meal. Friendly and helpful crew. 17 Sep AYT-LGW. On time with good inflight meal and efficient crew but the worst legroom I have ever experienced (B757) 4 plus hours of extreme discomfort unable to move legs and sat so far back in the seat that I was sat on the metal cross-bar. Would/could never fly Thomas Cook again unless could guarantee plane type.

Outbound. 6th September 2012. 7 hour delay. Very poor updates of flight status to passengers. £4.00 voucher given to each person for food and drink - this didn't go anywhere near covering the cost. I got crackers and cheese and some melon that came to £8.20. Inbound. 1.50pm 13th Sep 2012 from Zante to Manchester. Staff were professional and polite.

Gatwick to Hurghada 7th Sep and 14th Sep without doubt the worst flight for many years. Not for the service but seats and lack of leg room. At 6'4 like many of the other comments the pitch of the seat left me with my knees against the arms rests on the seat in front. After an hour pins and needles set in for the next 4 + hrs. I don't know how the company can get away with this. All of us comparing notes when we got off. One thing to note the flight was good leaving on time and the staff all very great. The flight wasn't cheap but disgraceful.

Outbound 6th Sep to Zante. 7 hour delay. Minimal information. Wrong gate on screen when boarding announced had to set off again to another gate. Food voucher of £4.00 given which was not enough to buy anything decent. Inbound 13th Sep 1.50pm. All ok apart from the attitude of 1 of the cabin crew who was arrogant and sharp in her responses to customers. Other cabin crew were professional in their manner.

Just returned from Crete. I am male 5' 10" average build. The seat was extremely uncomfortable. My knees were hard up against the seat in front. It was a night flight but absolutely impossible to even relax let alone snooze. I will never fly them again.

Gatwick to Dalaman and back on A330 wide body. Hour delay on outbound flight but when gate was announced boarding was very fast indeed. Aircraft clean and seat had lots of leg room but was hindered slightly by video box under seat. One film to watch whilst eating breakfast was OK. Crew serving me were rubbish and seemed robotic and couldn't really care less. On return flight departed on time crew were a lot better. Half the toilets were not working so queues built up quickly. Food good film rubbish but landed 20 minutes early. All in all a pretty good experience.

We travelled from Gatwick to Hurghada Egypt at the end of August 2012. I am 6' 4" with very long legs and the legroom on this ageing 757 was simply unacceptable. My knees had to squeeze into the gap either side of the seat in front where the arm rest mechanism is often getting trapped as people moved the rest up or down. I had an aisle seat on both outward and return journeys but could not raise my arm rest to stretch my legs into the aisle although people on the other side of the plane could! There was simply no button for me to lift it. Extra legroom seats where of course available for a fee (£30!) but these were not available to book in advance online. When I walked past the seats on the plane they were full of pretty short people looking very comfortable indeed! I see this as direct discrimination against the tall I can't control it so why should I have to sit in utter agony for 5.5 hours because you're too tight to add a few inches more leg room to your flights? The return journey was very warm onboard I asked 4 times if there was any chance the temperature could be turned down slightly along with several other passengers. I was told by the stewardess that "a couple of people have been saying it's too cold so we can hardly make it colder just for you can we? Give them a blanket! Overall shockingly bad never again.

Have just returned from Kefalonia with Thomas Cook in a 757 aircraft and have to say I have never encountered or endured so much discomfort from a seat. I am 6ft tall and weigh 16 stones and was by no means the largest person on this particular flight. I just managed to fit in the seat and found that my knees were pressed hard against the seat in front with my legs apart. I paid for an inflight meal but was unable to eat it properly as the tray came down against my tummy due to the massive size of the hinges on the tray the food when made was probably ok but after flying from the UK first found gravy in chicken dinner all dried out. All large gentlemen around me were also complaining about the leg room and tempers became evident as the ignorant people sitting in front who think they must put their seats in a reclined position for a three hour flight.

Flew from Manchester to Las Vegas return with my family (2 adults 3 children) and I have to say I was worried about the flight after reading some reviews of Thomas Cook but my family and I were thoroughly satisfied with the service provided. The food was good on both flights the staff were nice and dealt with an argument between passengers quickly and efficiently. Only complaints were delays both on the inbound and outbound journeys but this was due to the previous passengers leaving the plane. The in flight entertainment wasn't brilliant but I think that was because of my anxiety during the flight.

Flew Gatwick to Larnaca - awful experience. Nine and a half hour delay due to faults when we arrived at larnaca we were then told our luggage had not flown with us. Can't believe there is no entertainment on a four hour flight. Airplane cramped and very old on outward bound. On return - on time but only one working toilet.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
Manchester-Corfu-Manchester. Having pre-booked additional legroom seats arrived at airport at 5am (2 hours ahead of flight) to be told that the flight was split onto two planes no additional legroom seats available on the first one to leave so we could sit several rows apart or travel at least 4 hours later on the second plane. Our tickets included meals but the cabin crew tried to pass us by without giving us the meal we had paid for until asked and did not appear to believe that we had booked them. Return flight was better though again had to ask for meals. Customer service experience on return was far worse including being offered a voucher with Thomas Cook holidays (which we had not booked through) rather than offering to reimburse the £60 that the pre-booked seats had cost. No contact information on their website and was cut off 5 times when calling the only number I had and then 15 minute average wait on hold before customer service answered. Finally have been promised a reimbursement cheque but nothing above the amount we paid.

Gatwick to Crete in August and were pleasantly surprised with Thomas Cook especially after the negative reviews. They seem to be really listening to customers and we can't fault them everything was smooth on time comfortable (certainly no less so than any other budget flight) and the food was worth every penny. Only negative was on the return leg Heraklion airport is tiny and stuffed with English tourists this time of year. This isn't Thomas Cook's fault though and there was a small army of cheerful reps ready to help and marshal the queues.

CWL-PFO-CWL. My expectations were low but I came out of the experience pleasantly surprised. Without exception the crew were personable and interacted well with passengers. On time departure from CWL and return arrived 30 minutes early. Pre-booked in-flight catering which was flavoursome and served its purpose. Aircraft clean and did not feel too cramped. Seems my experience is not typical but perhaps the team operating out of Cardiff could give the rest of the Thomas Cook network a lesson or two.

Having booked with Thomas Cook (flight only) to Dalaman I was expecting the worse after reading the reviews. Left on time from Gatwick seats fine for a short flight staff really friendly food good. On our return we had a tight connection to Jersey flight arrived 30mins earlier than expected. Staff were pleasant and once again food good. No entertainment but really not a problem. Overall experience very good.

Newcastle-Antalya return. Aircraft old but clean. Did not have a meal. Flights early both ways. Cabin crew polite and friendly (unlike Thomson Airways). All in all a good flight.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
LBA-LPA-LBA. Check-in was hassle free. Boarded quick and efficient. Away off stand 5 minutes early. Breakfast was standard typical airline food. No entertainment meant we had to use our own entertainment devices (iPods etc). Arrived 10 minutes early. Inbound flight was exactly the same however the food was a 5/5! Chicken dinner or beef and mash. Cabin crew professional.

We flew to Cancun and back from Gatwick in August. Flight was on time the seat pitch huge (even my 6ft 2' boyfriend and leg room) and the cabin crew and flight deck crew were great. We have two rounds of drinks services on the way out one on the way back (which you have to pay for) one main meal (we opted for sausage and mash) which came with a roll crackers cheese and a hot drink. The snack was a scone with jam and clotted cream! Each seat had its own TV and there was a wide choice of entertainment. There is also a camera on the font of the plane so you can watch the whole flight from the flight decks point of view. We were kept informed by the pilot throughout the flight.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
Dreadful experience - Gatwick to Hurghada and back - very dated 757 that was scruffy and dirty and the seat pitch was extremely cramped (I am only 5 feet 11 inches tall) and it reminded me of the awful charter flights of the 1980's. No in-flight entertainment of any sort and the 'James Martin' meals were unappealing stodge. Cabin crew were either oblivious or didn't care that passengers were getting very drunk from drinking alcohol that they had carried onboard with them. Even budget airlines give a better flying experience.

Flew in May this year Brussels-Kos. Flight there 'ok' old plane though very dated and cramped paid for food and was not worth it at all. Flight back was a night flight and having booked a direct flight we ended up having to stop over in Crete actually had to get off the plane for an hour! However our holiday in Kos was wonderful so we booked another one and are going back in two weeks 27th Aug thought we would give Thomas Cook another shot. Got our flight documents through and the airline has changed our return flights by 10 hours earlier! I wouldn't mind but I could of booked for 8 nights (instead of 9) and had 8 days instead of 9 and would have paid 200 euro's less. Who on earth would not be a least a 'little' miffed at losing the whole last day? We will have to leave at 10 am instead of 10pm. Thomas Cook this is the last time!

TCX 1542 on June 30 was delayed for over 4 hours as a baggage handler drove into the rear door of the plan. This happened at 3am and when we checked in at 4.30 we were not told there was no announcement in departure lounge. Finally spoke to a representative at about 6.30 who said the plane had technical issues and to wait until 9am for the next bit of information. At 9.30 we were given GBP 6.50 voucher per person for food and told to come back at 11am. I only found out the nature of the delay after insisting on speaking to the duty manager. When on board (757-200) leg room not even big enough for my 18 month old daughter who continued to kick the seat in front. Same on the way back. Not impressed and will do everything possible to avoid TCX in the future.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
Manchester to Palma return. Thomas Cook really need to give up on their 757's unreliable dated and grubby. Flying used to be pleasurable. I will not re-book with TC whilst they continue to fly these aircraft. Would also comment that their check in online service is a joke. The queue for baggage drop took longer than those checking in at the terminal 6 check in desks and one baggage drop. To make matters worse they tore up the boarding cards I had printed to replace the with smaller ones for my convenience.

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
Cyprus from Birmingham on 7th August 2012. Cabin crew as always first class. Flight delayed 5+hours - a technical fault the captain emerged from his cockpit to give a face-to-face explanation as to what had happened. One problem I encountered with booking over the Internet - I purchased the inclusive 'bundle' but found it impossible to add an extra 5kg online. Told by customer services it was a fault in the programme but 3 weeks later this still had not been attended to. A further problem I have Airlines is trying to discover which days they fly from Paphos to East Midlands/Birmingham and return during Summer and Winter seasons. When I try to book a flight for a certain date I am usually told no flights available but it would be extremely helpful if they could offer something close to that date or that airport. If it were not so difficult to book I would use them much much more. I really think they have a good product - once I am on the plane!

MAN-IBZ-MAN. Had a 2 week holiday in Ibiza with Thomas Cook and was left overly impressed by everything considering the horror that we had last time with them. Flights were excellent Cabin Crew on the way back were excellent! Seat comfort was adequate a little hard but apart from that excellent. We were delayed by 40 mins on the flight home but not Thomas Cook's fault. Two bags un-accounted for was the problem but there wasn't one because we arrived only 20 minutes later than scheduled! Excellent service from TCX overall 10/10.

We went on a holiday to Kos Greece between 19th July and 2nd August flying from Gatwick Airport. Not much leg space at all. We decided to buy in-flight meals as we have small children. Never again. They served the hot meals 2 hours after take off first passing with drinks for anybody else magazine headphones for in- flight entertainment that you have to pay for! We could live with it on the outbound flight as it was the afternoon but coming back the flight was at 8pm. As soon as I boarded I went straight to the crew manager asking to serve at least kids meals before starting with anything else as they were tired hungry and it would be too late for their dinner waiting for 2 hours. Big smile on he said sure no problem. I was so angry when they did come around 2 hours later with the meals. Do not waste your money on in-flight meals which are not worth the money they charge! We will avoid it in the future! Flight entertainment choice was OK but TV small and quality is terrible!

### Thomas Cook Airlines customer review
Dreadful flight cramped conditions husband 6 ft 4 had to pay extra and be seated elsewhere from myself and our little children. Although we had paid for an in flight meal once the flight attendant got to myself and my children they had ran out with ten other guests with the same misfortune. We were told that they had only put two crates of food on rather than three. I had to wait with a crying child until my meal came and was thanked for my being patient although this was said with a rather sarcastic tone! Passengers were classes as customers over the tannoy system when being ordered to use the correct toilet and the pilot spoke to us passengers twice.

Only now do I realise our so called one off "adventure" is in fact a regular occurrence and many people have had the same experience. Do not fly Thomas Cook until they take their ailing older 757 aeroplanes out of service due to continually having technical faults and operational difficulties. Flight from Mahon to LGW 16th July 2012 departed on time 10.25 am. 15 minutes prior to landing our Captain announced that weather conditions at Gatwick had deteriorated rapidly and we could not land diverted to CDG Airport Paris. Later told our plane had a technical fault and our de-icer wasn't working therefore we couldn't land. Sat on the runway for more than 4 hours. Food and drinks could not be bought as the provisions were on a timer. Crew were exceptionally good given the circumstances. It took hours to get steps to the plane before doors could open and air could filter into the oven like interior. Engineers had to fly from the UK and work through the night. Eventually offloaded and sent to the terminal. Tried to get alternative flights home but none available except Air France to Heathrow at £395 euros pp our car was parked at Gatwick. A meal voucher was issued for dinner and breakfast in several sittings. We had to get up at 4am to return to the terminal for our flight to LGW. We were met by Thomas Cook reps and given a letter of apology!

I flew from Gatwick to Larnaca. I have never had a worse flight in my entire life (except the return journey). There was absolutely no room to move in the seat I am quite tall (5 ft 10") and my knees where jammed up against the seat in front for over 4 hours. The extra legroom seats where taken so I had to put up with being in a cramped cold plane with no way of sleeping at 2.30 am. I will not be using Thomas Cook again unless their planes are updated.

Flew on the 15th of June from Glasgow Intl. as the start of a 2 week holiday to Tenerife South. The check in desk people were extremely helpful as we had requested a window seat for my son. We were given it and shortly went through to departures. Plane took off 5 minutes late but didn't bother anyone as the plane arrived ahead of schedule. The seats had lots of legroom as it was the new 757/300 the inflight entertainment was good. Food was lovely. Coming back the plane was the same one we took off and arrived 25 minutes before scheduled time. It was a night time flight and was a good one very peaceful and there were not a lot of announcements due to the time which I thought was good.

Travelled 6th July from East Midlands to Tenerife after 2hrs flying we returned to Manchester airport. The pilot said a plane was waiting at Manchester to fly us straight out got to Manchester had to go to departure lounge new plane not ready as it had a fault too. After 2hrs we boarded new plane however we had to sit on the plane again as they had not loaded the cases. We arrived at hotel Saturday at 12.30am we left East Midlands at 12.05pm Friday lunchtime.

Flew LGW to LPA and return in June/July. Aircraft B757-200. Showing age but clean and felt a generally comfortable journey. Pre booked seats on exit row (11DE) where plenty of leg room. Crew friendly and almost too chatty but was nice to have real humans and not robots looking after us! Food tasty new chef apparently. Recommended! Free drink with meal. Also drinks trolley for pay came round twice. Pilot announcement almost inaudible couldn't actually hear clear works just a muffle. No apology for 1 hour delay outbound. On time inbound. Tip: use online check in for LGW departure as there is a separate bag drop desk which was very quick. LPA check in almost painful as not clear which desk is what flight and left lot of people hovering and guessing.. All in all excellent value great hot food for a charter airline. Would be great if Thomas Cook put their version of premium economy on such flights. Will fly again.

We flew on Airbus 321 there were holes in the wall panels and the leg room was awful the crew were very good though. The James Martin meal was ok if you like that sort of thing. Would we fly with them again - no definitely not. We have always used Thomson's before and their standard is 100% better and you get in flight entertainment too.

Flew 3 May from Belfast to Lanzarote and Lanzarote to Belfast 10 May. Was informed there would be in flight entertainment for kids don't know where they got that info from as there was no entertainment to keep a 4 year old child amused for over 4 hours. Was given the very back seats on the plane so asked if I could move a few rows forward where there was seats open with exact same leg room was informed I could move for 10 euros per person. Plane is very small inside no legroom and passageway is very tight. Interior is terrible and seats were stained and dirty. My seat could not even recline but staff were not interested they are there to sell as much food beverage and gifts as possible to passengers. Planes need upgrading. Pilot spoke twice during flight.
