### "a delightful experience"
I recently flew American Eagle from DCA to PHL on Republic Airways, and I must say it was a delightful experience. Despite a minor delay due to operational circumstances, the E175 main economy extra setup offered ample legroom and a level of comfort that made the short 27-minute flight exceptionally pleasant. The crew’s professionalism truly stood out, they even made a point to walk around and offer a water service, a thoughtful gesture you wouldn’t expect on such a brief journey. Overall, Republic Airways continues to deliver a professional, efficient, and safe product under the American Eagle brand. Truly, there’s nothing to complain about!

### “friendly and professional demeanor”
The Embraer 175 continues to be a game-changer for the American Airlines Group, especially on short-haul routes like the 27-minute flight from Washington Reagan National (DCA) to Philadelphia (PHL). Despite the brief duration and some turbulence, the crew efficiently completed first-class service while maintaining a friendly and professional demeanor. The first-class seat provided more than enough comfort for the journey, reinforcing the E175’s reputation as an excellent aircraft for regional operations. Given Republic Airways strong performance, American Airlines should seriously consider adding Republic to its wholly owned subsidiaries.

### "reliable and professional service"
Had a great flight from PHL to DCA on American Eagle, operated by Republic Airlines. A brief winter maintenance delay ensured a safe departure, and while we experienced mild turbulence leaving Philadelphia and again upon arrival in Washington, the pilots handled it smoothly. Due to the conditions, in-flight service was not possible, but safety remained the priority. The Main Cabin Extra seats made for a much more comfortable experience, and with a flight time of under 30 minutes, we arrived quickly and safely. Republic continues to deliver a reliable and professional service for the American Airlines group.

### "reliable, safe, and comfortable"
Once again, American Eagle, operated by Republic Airways, delivered a reliable, safe, and comfortable flight from Washington DCA to Philadelphia. Republic continues to uphold American Airlines’ commitment to excellence, providing a seamless experience despite minor operational challenges. Our departure was delayed due to traffic changes at DCA following recent tragic events, but the crew handled the situation with professionalism and care. Their dedication to passenger comfort and safety was evident throughout the flight, ensuring a smooth and reassuring journey. While delays are never ideal, the priority is always arriving safely—and that’s exactly what happened. Kudos to Republic Airways and the outstanding crew for their continued commitment to quality service.

### "another fantastic experience"
I recently flew from PHL to DCA on American Eagle operated by Republic, and it was another fantastic experience. The E175 remains my favorite aircraft for regional travel—spacious, comfortable, and perfect for short flights. Despite the flight being only 30 minutes, the crew went above and beyond by offering beverage service, which exceeded my expectations for such a short route. As someone who travels this route twice a week, I deeply appreciate the attentiveness of the regional air crew, who consistently provide a level of care and attention that rivals the mainline carrier. Excellent service all around!

### "no compensation, terrible service"
Not Verified |  My wife and I booked American airlines from Heathrow to Huntsville the later part of this journey was American Eagle from Philadelphia to Charlotte then Charlotte to Huntsville. The first flight was truly fantastic with attentive staff. When we arrived at Charlotte and tried to check n for the second flight, the booking staff let me wife go on then told me my seat didn't exist and I needed to stand to one side while they let everyone else on and then looked at my issue. When I queried this the female staff member became irate and said I was being sarcastic and she might not let me on, my wife returned and we were moved to one side, another member of staff took out tickets and reissued two seats at the back of the plane. I asked about compensation, the original member of staff curtly said it would be sent me but did not take details. On the plane we found a single man sat in what should have been my seat, I commented to the staff about this but they just manoeuvred us to new seats, after that the cabin crew kept away from us. I have complained to American airlines three times and keep getting bot answers, no refund, no compensation, terrible service. I think the man in my seat was a friend or colleague of the staff. Abysmal treatment from American Eagle and American airlines.

### "a fantastic experience"
I had a fantastic experience on  American Eagle, operated by Republic Airlines. The flight departed on time, and despite being only 27 minutes, the service was exceptional. We were offered a pre-departure beverage and even a full beverage service once airborne, a rare treat for such a short flight! As someone who takes this route twice a week, I’ve consistently been impressed with the professionalism and efficiency of the crew.

### “truly nothing to complain about!”
My recent 27-minute flight from DCA to PHL, operated by PSA Airlines for American Eagle, was a pleasant experience. Despite a minor delay while waiting for the crew to arrive from another flight, the service was good. We were offered a pre-departure beverage and even received beverage service during the short flight a nice touch for such a brief journey. The CRJ 900 proved to be more comfortable than the CRJ 700, making the quick trip enjoyable. For such a short flight, there’s truly nothing to complain about!

### "smooth and enjoyable flight"
I recently flew American Eagle operated by Republic from Washington DC to Philadelphia, and I was really impressed. The E175 was comfortable and well-suited for the short hop between cities. Even though the flight was only 27 minutes and we had a slight delay leaving Washington due to congestion, the crew still managed to offer a full beverage service in first class, which I really appreciated. Despite the delay, we landed in Philadelphia on time. It was a smooth and enjoyable flight overall!

### “flight crew attentive and professional”
I recently flew from PHL to DCA on American Eagle, operated by Republic Airways, and had a fantastic experience. The flight crew was attentive and professional, ensuring everything ran smoothly from boarding to landing. The aircraft was clean and comfortable, and the service was prompt despite the short flight duration. The pilot provided clear updates, and the entire trip was seamless. A great example of efficient and excellent regional service!

### "nothing to justify their behavior"
I thought Spirit was the worst airline, but I've found a new worst one after flying with American Eagle. The flight I was on started the day by being late, then they finally boarded everybody, and we waited for about 1h inside the plane not knowing whether the it could fly or not. So we returned to the gate, just for more waiting inside the plane, but hey, be prepared to get out any moment. After two false alarms, they tell us we'll, let's get out and wait for what happens, maybe this beauty will still fly today. At this point, we're already about 2h late. Then we get the news that the little cute plane needs a thing replaced, and this thing happens to be in Ohio or elsewhere in the country. Ok, now they need to sort out all of us bunch of passengers. Under all these circumstances, one might expect that the staff on groud would be at least, at the very bottom of cordial human relations, neutral as for the treatment to the people in need of their help. But no, they're giving you attitude like it's your fault their plane is bus with wings and not their's company. I went to ask a question about my new assigned flight--that was going to depart 6h later than my original one--and she didn't even listen, telling me that she didn't know about any other flight other than that one flight she had finished boarding. Mind you, I was there for hours and hours and not even once I saw any of the people that were on the flight being rude to them, so there's nothing to justify their behavior. And that's not all, the new flight also ended up departing 1h later. I just hope I'll never need to fly with them again and that they get back what they're giving.

### "Overall it was pretty good"
Not Verified |   There was no problems, everything was good except a 30 minute delay. The seat was ok the, legroom was decent, but the cabin was a little dirty. The crew was nice. Overall it was pretty good.

### "The delay is just crazy"
Not Verified |  The delay is just crazy! The first thing related to Heavy rain and little storm, its still reasonable for the delay at that time for around 1.5 hrs. And then, they allows us to boarding and waits for 45 minutes in the airplane after the door closed. Next, I think due to queue in the taxy way, we just being round and around the airport for 1 hour. And they decided to back to gates because need to refuel the airplane. Took around 45 minutes, and the passenger allowed to go out to have a quick drink, or to bathroom while refueling. After that due one passenger decided to leave, all the passengers need to leave the airplane and re-boarding again and wait for like 10 minutes again in the terminal. After that, we fly to GSO normally. Well, maybe the story a little bit doesn't make sense, but that's happening

### "need to have overflow staff"
The first leg of my trip on the American Eagle from Palm Springs, ca to Phoenix, Az flight was on time with no issue, but, my return from Phoenix to Palm Springs, ca, that was supposed to leave at 5:35 pm was continually being updated on the screen and did not leave until after around 9pm.. a little over an hour before we boarded, I visited the American Airlines customer service office next to our boarding location, I was told that American Eagle was not American Airlines etc and she looked on her computer screen and then told me some story about not knowing exactly what the delay was, possibly birds flying into an engine delayed crew members from arriving (but the plane was there and the pilots were already there walking around waiting to board the plane to go to Palm Springs, as well). Anyway, two flight attendants showed up and we were able to board. I asked one of the attendants (who was very helpful and courteous) if she had been flown in to work the flight (I thought what the woman said earlier might have been valid and that the crew that might have been on a plane that dealt with birds flying into the engine, caught a different flight to attend to the plane in Phoenix) but she said there were two no-call no-shows and she and the other attendant were called in to work that flight. Thank goodness those two women showed up or who knows how long it would have taken for us to get out of that airport. I know we cannot blame the entire airline for irresponsible crew members, but there is obviously something going on there. Maybe they need to have overflow staff to assure flights are not delayed due to staff members not showing up.

### "Very great experience"
Very great experience. Will 100% fly again. Comfort was great, loved the free food and snacks. Also crew was very nice and always tried to help me whenever I needed help.

### "learn how to treat passengers"
Not Verified |  Before even getting on the flight the staff was rude and said we have to valet our roller bag and said they don't care if we miss our connecting flight that we have no choice and you have to deal with it. When we get to Charlotte we are instructed to wait on the right hand side of the bridge to get our bags. We do just that. We are then yelled at multiple times to move from the ground crew even though we did exactly what they instructed us to do. Needless to say they need to work on their customer service and learn how to treat passengers.

### "It’s like an expensive bus ride"
Not Verified |  Honestly American Airlines has to do much better. These carriers they use for smaller cities are tiny and full to capacity. There’s barely any room to move. Why in the world when I am booking American Airlines am I being assigned this carrier? I think this information should be better disclosed to passengers when they are purchasing their flights. The plane smelt like pee and we were delayed by over 15 minutes without any explanation. It’s like an expensive bus ride to upstate NY without any damn amenities. So long as they continue to utilize this carrier for the the airport I live near to I won’t be booking any flights with with them.

### "personable, efficient, and highly competent"
Not Verified |  I want to strongly recommend the Disabled Persons Services employee, Kevin, who helped transport me across three terminals at LAX this week. He is personable, efficient, and highly competent at his job. We really needed someone like him that morning.

### "Absolute garbage"
Absolute garbage. Boarded the plane only to be told to get off, Cancelled our flight and didn’t even inform us, refused to talk to customers at the kiosk, then informs us that they can’t get us to our final destination of San Francisco (one of the larges cities on the West Coast) until 36hrs after we are supposed to arrive. Lost AB&B, lost car reservation with car seat (that they aren’t going refund us for), and now we’re have to make up 2 days of travel hurrying to a wedding in Oregon, losing the time we were gonna spend driving the PCH (which is half of our trip). Please for the love of God choose a different airline.

### "unfortunately not wonderful"
Not Verified |  Our American Eagle Flight from SRQ to Charlotte (flt. 5521 departing SRQ at 1:30 pm on April 13) was unfortunately not wonderful. The flight attendant for business was curt, draconian in approach, and very stingy with snacks. I have flown this route numerous times and when I have asked for more than one item it was gladly given - .not the case until the entire cabin was served per the statement of this attendant, and even then, when she returned and I watched her stow the leftover snacks and I asked it was given to me with a bit of a frustrated attitude on her part. The other issue is that in prior flights on CRJ 900s, I have always been able to stow a rollaboard, which can be easily stowed above the seats the right side of this aircraft. When I asked this attendant why the policy had changed, she was rather impertinent stating that this had always been the policy by law (i.e. the need to check rollaboards). You can check your records to see how often I have flown this route from either SRQ to Charlotte or DCA and I was always allowed to bring a bag on board. I sense that my question, which was very diplomatically phrased, was not appreciated and led to the rest of our less than satisfactory interaction. I have flown American for years and prior to the pandemic was in Executive Platinum status for many of them. It is discouraging to have had a rude attendant, particularly when we paid to be in business class. It was also interesting to her how soft and welcoming her demeanor became when advertising the credit card and is associated amenities. Please understand that I don't like giving negative information nor do I wish to complain. These are challenging times for the airlines as well as passengers who fly them. But my attitude is always positive and welcoming and I expect no less than those whose service I have procured - and this was clearly substandard.

### "last time I fly this airline"
Do not fly American Eagle. I flew on flight 6002 March 11,2022 from Montgomery to Charlotte. This was the worst flight ever. Their customer service is ridiculous. We landed in Spartanburg NC for a reason that no one knew. We were held on the plane for 4 hours waiting plus the 5:30am flight which was 50 minutes. The entire flight lost their connection flights and had to suffer the long day at the air port because no one knew how to connect a flight to another flight. We weren’t given any options. Nothing to help us get through. Some customers had medical Conditions that required eating before medication and nothing. As we were waiting the toilets got stuffed up and couldn’t flush any more. The seats we sat in basically had no support in the middle and sagged down the center. It was painful sitting and waiting. All in all this will be the last time I fly this airline.

### "try to avoid American in the future"
Booked this round trip around 3 weeks in advance. Was rather expensive and I felt tricked into paying to reserve my seat at the time of booking. I found out subsequently that reserving was free within 24hrs of the flight. I felt it was mean of the airline to charge for 1 checked bag. I have flown many times with various European, Asian and US airlines in the past 40 years and this is the first time I have incurred these charges on top of what I believe to have been an expensive flight in the first place. The staff encountered as well as the flights themselves were no better or worse than the competition. I will try to avoid American in the future!

### "that’s not the way you speak to a customer"
Not Verified |  I’m on the plane as we speak making a review because the flight attendant is very rude. I’m on flight 5216 to RDU from Philly. First off let me start off with my families original flight was canceled and we had to wait 14hrs in the airport for another flight. We should of been given more than $12 food vouchers for 14 hrs. Then for us to get on a plane where the attendant has an attitude for what reason we don’t know. He asked me was I willing to help with an emergency because I have an end seat. I shook my head yes and aggressively he says you need to say yes or no. Excuse me! He could have said that a little better. Then I was looking at him and he asked me did I have a problem? Really? I have a problem because I looked at him? I just laughed and my husband said something to him and he walked away. Better customer service training needed because that’s not the way you speak to a customer.

### "The flight attendants were the worst!"
Absolutely horrible! The flight attendants were the worst! They made me wear a different mask because apparently there was something wrong with my mask, even though I passed through security and had just got off a previous plane without anybody making me switch masks! As soon as I sat down, she told the other attendant to make sure I was wearing the new mask. Then they continued to target me on the plane by telling me my pillow needs to be stored under the seat, which is a lie! No airplane carrier makes you do that. Then the older lady told me to put my phone on airplane mode as I was finishing a text. I told her to give me one second and I will put it on there, but then she yelled at me saying, “Now! Put it on airplane mode now!” So I did. Then the same lady came back a minute later to harass me again and said “I need your phone on airplane mode.” I told her that I did the first time she asked and showed her the airplane symbol on my phone. Then she got an attitude and left. I will never fly with this airline again.

### "American Airlines. It's a clown show!"
Jay L. Schottenstein makes $14.7 million/yr then pays his top 5 another $21million to pick you up 6 hrs late in an outdated plane that offers no snacks, drinks, ice and only enough warm water for 1/2 the passengers, oh and no wifi. Only to leave you stranded for 17 + hrs and offer no hotel room or meal vouchers. Then pays nice people poor wages to say sorry through a smile. Tells you it's due to weather only to find out from the pilot it's mechanical. American Airlines. It's a clown show!

### "The cabins are so small and they are filling every seat"
Not Verified |  I would not recommend ever flying this airline. The cabins are so small and they are filling every seat. The flight is packed. It seems their response to our safety during COVID is to pack the small planes where everyone but do not provide any inflight food or beverage service. I flew Delta 2 days ago, what a difference. Every other seat was open. I felt very safe from others who may have the virus and they were great at providing safe food and beverage service. I can't believe the difference in these two airlines. Especially when the price of the flights were exactly the same. I would never choose to fly American Eagle again.

### "Sensitivity training. Invest in it"
I am usually not one to take the time to complete reviews or even the one to care about leaving a review. However this time I felt compelled. I was recently a passenger on a flight from Charlotte to New Bern, North Carolina. It had been a weekend. I was boarding the plane. With two bags strategically positioned but still somewhat awkwardly, on my person making my way to my seat. I was wearing new platform sneakers I treated myself to. It had been a year. I think we can all relate. The person in front of me stopped in his tracks to snatch up a spot to place his item in the “overhead bin”. So I had to stop mid step and took a step back. Of course, this happened to be right in front of someone of your staff sitting in one of the rows. He looked at me and said “too much to drink?” I felt instantly embarrassed. Because he wasn’t quiet and discreet. No sir” I said. but thank you. What I wanted to say was, I did have a glass of wine prior to boarding. But thank you for assuming that I was drunk. Not that I’ve spent a last minute whirlwind weekend with my family in Massachusetts, after 14 months of not seeing them due to Covid. Not seeing my father with kidney failure for fear of bringing the pandemic to his door step, as I am a primary care nurse practitioner. It wasn’t the weight of a weekend spent desperately making up for lost time and salvaging moments. Not being exhausted staying up with him because he was too afraid to asleep. You don’t know me. I don’t know you. In a world that is already struggling. Be kind. Do not assume the worst. As much as anyone, I know the importance of safety. Ask if I am ok. Or say nothing at all. When I really wanted to answer with, if only it was that simple. I am not sure what your company has identified as core values, but where I work, these interactions would be unacceptable. Sensitivity training. Invest in it.

### "not concerned with even trying to be on time"
Not Verified |  Flight departed twenty minutes late. Waited forty five minutes to park after landing because we had to wait for the one of nine gates that was occupied to depart. Ground personnel only handle one plane at a time. Obviously this airline is not concerned with even trying to be on time. First class cabin very cold. Cabin crew said they could not help because of a design flaw.

### "a mediocre experience"
Not Verified |  Let’s start with the bad, that is terminal F and Philadelphia, it just is not a nice place, though the food court is nice! LEX is pretty pleasant however, and every single AA employee I talked to at both airports and on the flight were pretty good! My biggest issue was space. I’m 5’8, and about 175 pounds and I was cramped into the little ERJ. So, overall, a mediocre experience. Also, this flight was a Piedmont Airlines flight, operating as American Eagle!

### "The seat in front of mine was obviously filthy"
American promises that they keep their planes clean, especially during COVID. The seat in front of mine was obviously filthy and had been for some time. The headrest had a layer of built up dead skin, there was popcorn on the floor, and there was a dirty water mark above my head. None of these obvious things had been cleaned in quite some time. I actually touched the seat in front of me and felt the greasy build up on the headrest. It’s unbelievable that American Airlines would lie about their cleanliness. I have pictures to prove all my claims.

### "overall service of the airline was excellent"
Not Verified |  I think the overall service of the airline was excellent. The flight was a bit pricey especially since I had a 6 hour layover for a flight from Charleston to Fayetteville. I also think due to covid the plane should be boarded from the back to the front due to space of the airplane and deboarded from front to back.

### "waited over 45 mins for a single passenger to board"
We boarded on time and then waited over 45 mins for a single passenger to board. The fight is only 30 mins so we sat on the airplane on with masks on for longer than the actual flight for a single passenger, turns out it was an employee in uniform. Not sure why we had to wait considering we paid for this flight and they clearly did not. Probably wouldn't be as annoyed if not sitting for hours on end with this mask on.

### "No social distancing at all"
They do not care about covid at all. Packed airplane elbow to elbow and they pretend a mask will help me against the virus. No social distancing at all which is law everywhere else except airlines and Walmart apparently. Put my life at risk over a few extra dollars. Never giving them my money again unless they refund me for the complete disregard for my and the other customers health.

### "zero knowledge of their product"
Nashville to Charlotte. All the flight attendants was possibly the worst I’ve had in my life. Not only was they were rude, but had zero knowledge of their product, and super unprofessional.

### "cost me hundreds of extra dollars"
Dallas to Springfield. Initial flight time was 10:30 am, 30 minutes into the flight they decided there was something wrong with the plane so we had to return to Dallas. We were then sent to several different terminals because the workers didn’t realize there is more than one town named Springfield. Finally, after an hour or so a replacement plane arrived, they decided that the plane was also broken. Several hours later we were offered nasty stale sandwiches as an apology for their continued screw ups. We were then able to board the third plane. This plane was randomly picked for the pilots to manually figure the weight of the aircraft. Imagine my surprise when they decided the plane weighed too much. People were kicked off the plane and we had to wait an extra hour and a half to remove some fuel. This garbage airline company cost me hundreds of extra dollars (hotel, rental car, food) because I then missed the following connecting flights and had to stay the night in Missouri.

### "terrible Customer experience"
Not Verified |  Charlotte to Birmingham–Shuttlesworth. PSA an American Eagle operator is killing the American brand. I have been rescheduled twice today on different flight to Birmingham because planes have maintenance issues and all they do is keep moving times out .. both have been knows for hours.. and now they are saying they don’t have the manpower to go get a new plane that is parked at another gate As a concierge key member of American Airlines I just wish the American leadership would start looking at these operators in American Eagle and cancel their contracts due to poor performance and terrible Customer experience. The worst I have seen in my 30 years of flying

### "the worse flight experience"
Monterey to Providence via Phoenix / Washington. This was the worse flight experience in my life. Hours of delays, the aircraft was old and seats falling apart. I traveled from Monterey. The plane sat for over 30 mins after boarding. No weather problems. Then there was almost four hours delay in DC. Returning home there was a three hour delay in Phoenix. The toilet lights were not working. The WiFi was working. Everything that could go wrong happened. I will never fly American airlines after my next trip. It's been booked and I can't afford to cancel. I would rate this a zero if I could.

### "cancelled flight or a delay"
Dallas Ft Worth to Amarillo. Pretty much done flying American. Every single time it results in a cancelled flight or a delay, and American shows no sense of urgency. They do not care. Not one bit. You cannot make plans when flying American because their planes are so old and things fail when time for take off. Highly suggest using a different airline.

### "Flight was consistently delayed"
Reagan to Providence with American Eagle. Flight was consistently delayed. Gate changed 2 times. Plane changed to a smaller plane. Was not informed of the smaller plane or that those with tickets in rows not available on the new plane would get bumped. Meal voucher given was declined when I tried to use it. Was not told original flight had mechanical issues and another plane was being used which had room for some of those that were bumped until I overheard other passengers talking about it. Worst experience ever.

### "our flight also is delayed for maintenance"
Philadelphia to Wilkes Barre. While waiting for my flight 2 other flights delayed by American Eagle for maintenance. Then it’s our turn, 10 mins before boarding and our flight also is delayed for maintenance. Sounds to me like someone should take better care of their equipment/aircraft.

### "had consistently poor service"
Not Verified |  Had to use American Eagle to get to and from DFW to San Angelo Regional Airport and back or I never would have flown them. I've done this twice in the past year and both trips (a total of 4 flights) provided similar experiences. I have had consistently poor service (or lack thereof). The planes honestly scare me with how many obvious repairs (that don't seem particularly well done) have been done to these ancient airplanes. They seem dirty as well, though that could just be the yellowed plastic from age. The seats are hit or miss depending on how worn out the cushion is. They don't seem to have been replaced since the airplanes were manufactured (probably 20-30 years ago by the looks of them). The planes are small so if you have a standard to large carry on, it will have to be checked in. This is more FYI, since they can't really control the size of the overhead compartments (though they could buy planes made in this decade and solve this issue). The counter was supposed to have staff from 4 am - 7 pm, according to a sign on their counter. There was no one there at all. Keep in mind this small airport has 2 gates and an average of 3 flights a day. I would presume having an employee man the counters for three flights wouldn't be too much to ask, but apparently it is for American Eagle. I can't really comment on their in-flight service since, in all fairness, their flights are usually too short to be able to provide any services. However, I can comment that the pilots do not fly well, and I legitimately thought the plane had crash landed at first when the plane just dropped several meters out of the sky on landing. In the future I will just fly into DFW and drive the 3 hours to San Angelo. I will also never fly American Airlines itself again because of their partnership with this atrocious airline.

### "never fly American Eagle again"
By far worst flying experience ever. 2 out of four flights cancelled, and one delayed. Our plane leaving grand rapids got up to speed almost off the ground and then came to a screeching halt. The flight was then cancelled due to mechanical issues. I spoke with customer service at the 800 number, the my customer service rep was very rude to me and accused me of being rude because I was displeased my flight would have then been delayed by over 24 hours. I then took a flight the next morning that was delayed as well, and had to fly into Manchester NH over 2.5 hour drive from my home. I will never fly American Eagle again.

### "hated the strange music"
Not Verified |  Green Bay to Chicago. Generally good service. What I hated was the strange music we were forced to listen to when we first boarded the plane. Silence would be a perfect option.

### "it will be the last time."
Providence to Chicago. First time I flew American Eagle. And it will be the last time. Delayed an hour because of a cabin defect. Overhead compartment door would not closed fully. Was fixed via duct tape. The guy had to go off to get another piece. Also their boarding process is unfriendly.

### "an amazing flight attendant"
Not Verified |  I am sorry i cannot get my Eticket to load. I was on AA3533 03 August departed Chicago O'Hare airport to Madison WI. I had just an amazing flight attendant Sara. She was so friendly and kind. Peggy

### "delayed, delayed, delayed"
Philadelphia to Cincinnati. The flight keeps being delayed, delayed, delayed. All the staff is offering is one excuse after another. This airline is holding us hostage. The airline has inefficient maintenance and terrible escalation procedures. Now we are being moved to the opposite end of the terminal. This is my first and last time flying this shower.

### "not respect people’s time"
Philadelphia to Cincinnati. American Airlines does not respect people’s time! Or I think they don’t know the importance of time. Ok to be on point I know they always do delays but they hide it until last moment! I think AA needs some training. Please AA improve your service and taste of cookies served on plane. Crew members are rude and so is customer assistance.

### "overbooked that flight"
I went from Bangor to Philadelphia then to Kansas city. And the same route back. My flight was in time which was a relief because of the buses you have to take in Philly to your connecting flight. However on my way back in Kansas city they had over booked the fought by 4 people! Luckily 4 people offered to stay back because they were given 1,000 vouchers once we got to Philly they had overbooked that flight by 2 people and a seat was broken. For whatever reason, my boarding pass didn't have a seat or boarding number on it. This was extremely stressful due to the fact that there are only 2 flights a day that fly into Bangor. 3 people had to stay behind that day. How they get away with one booking. People pay money for these tickets and expect to get to and from their destination in a safe and timely manner.

### "cancelled the connecting flight"
Beaumont to Billings via Dallas. The tickets were ridiculously expensive. The same day I booked, I had to change our flights to the next day. Even though the tickets were still same price for the next day as the ones I purchased, I was charged 150 dollars for the change. Then American Airlines pressured me into buying trip insurance, telling me that it would cover any airline changes and cancellations. As I boarded the plane going home, AA cancelled the connecting flight. When I landed in Dallas, I received text that AA re-booked connecting flight for the next day. Now they don't want to pay for the cancelled and re-booked flight (that I was unable to take & I had to rent a car to drive 6 hours home which cost me over 300 dollars). When they were pressuring me to buy the insurance, they NEVER told me the insurance only kicks in after a 12 hr delay. This delay was overnight. Meaning I originally had an evening connecting flight that was cancelled. So, my children & I were supposed to spend the night in DFW airport Isn't that why I bought trip insurance To cover the costs when this happens I know they cannot control the weather, but they could honor the insurance they pressure their customers to buy and not make ridiculous parameters that hinder customers from receiving relief from the insurance. Furthermore, ridiculous fees AA charges for changing flights (after booking the same day within a few hours) is even more reason why I love Southwest. American Airlines need to take lessons from SWA. I was very disappointed that Southwest Airlines do not fly to Billings, MT or I would have definitely flown SWA - No hidden fees, no baggage fees, no fees for changing flights, and amazing customer service!

### "the worst customer service"
Absolutely the worst customer service. Nobody is accountable for anything and has no clue of what is happening. I flew from San Jose to Los Angeles on February 11. I accidentally left my wallet on the aircraft. I got a call saying I left it and should collect it from Lost and Found the next day. When I went to LAX nobody had any clue about where it was. The lady at Lost and Found was not helpful and rude. I spent 4 hours at the airport going from counter to counter. I have a voicemail recording saying they found my wallet and then asking me to pick it up. I even spoke to someone over the phone and confirmed the same. However, in less than 12 hours they lost my wallet while getting it from the gate to lost and found. I made several attempts to reach them but nobody answered the phone. When I called the customer service number, they had no clue of how to handle this issue. I filed a report online, but they didn't even respond to that. It shows how careless the employees are with customers' property. They lost something which they themselves found! In less than 12 hours they couldn't even transport it from the gate to the lost and found department. Pathetic.

### "one of the most enjoyable flights"
My brother and I had flown from Charlotte to Dulles and originally had seats towards the back of the plane. I am 6'6 and my brother is 6'4 with a prosthetic leg. Our flight attendant watched us struggle to get to our seats and cram ourselves in for the flight. He walked back and invited us to come sit in first class in 2 open seats and proceeded to make it one of the most enjoyable flights we had been on with outstanding service. We will be back to American in the future!

### "not first class attention at all"
Not Verified |  Flew Louisville to Los Angeles via Dallas Fort-Worth with American Eagle. I was in first class and didn't see any difference. It was an early morning flight and it was cold. They didn't have any blankets. The same food was offered as in the other sections. It was not first class attention at all.

### "caused a 24 hour delay"
Not Verified |  Knoxville to North Eleuthera via Miami. One mechanical problem followed by another, compounded by a breakdown in ground equipment caused a 5 hour delay at our origin. As a result, we missed our connection in Miami despite scheduling a 3 hour layover. This caused a 24 hour delay. As a result we miss at least one day of vacation, a day we have to pay for. The information provided while waiting on the tarmac for almost 3 hours was infrequent and unhelpful. Customer service" was provided only grudgingly with every attempt made to provide minimum assistance.

### "Service was friendly"
Salt Lake City to Los Angeles. The flight got delayed because of a lengthy De-icing process. Service was friendly for a very short flight, just drinks and snacks. Landing in LAX was very smooth and luggage delivered on time but the American Eagle terminal is uncomfortably distant from the main terminal in LAX.

### "staff is very bad"
Charlotte to Toronto. Never travel by this airline. The staff is very bad, rude and not at all friendly. We pay for our flight and in return we at least want a smile or a courtesy but do not expect it from this airline.

### "the ghetto of airplanes"
Kansas City via Dallas Ft Worth operated by Mesa Airlines. If you're going to make your passengers slum their ride home, don't upcharge for premium seating. They wont provide even their first names for complaints and when I tried to show my receipt and what my upgrade included, the female flight attendant stormed off. I sat in 4F from MCI to DFW arrived 12/19/18 at 9:04 pm. This is the ghetto of airplanes and service. Bad form, American. I'm seriously thinking of switching to United for my weekly flights.

### "not be using this airline again"
Nashville to Chicago. My initial flight was an hour and a half late. No reason for the delay was given. I ran through the airport to catch my connecting flight and they refused to let me board with 10 minutes to spare. The plane was still stationary and attached to the gate 25 minutes later. I asked them the soonest they could get me a flight to my destination and they replied curtly. 4 PM, tomorrow. That's all we can do". They had me in tears - will not be using this airline again.

### "never fly American Airlines again"
Charlotte to Knoxville. First the flight was delayed by one hour. After we finished boarding we had to wait additional 20 for a crew to arrive from another flight. Then we arrive in Knoxville and we had to wait on tarmac for 30 mins to be taken closer to the airport. I will never fly American Airlines again.

### "seats were super comfortable"
Detroit to Chicago. The seats were super comfortable for an airplane in this size. Even this small airplane has wifi onboard. We arrived so early so we had to wait for ground service which took too long and we exited the aircraft at the exact estimated time, so we didn't loose anytime.

### "Worst experience I’ve had"
Birmingham to Fort Smith via Dallas. Worst experience I’ve ever had. Flights cancelled due to maintenance not weather - agents aren’t being told truth to tell us -  either that or they are told to lie to us. Just tell me the truth and I can accept it. But to lie to us is unacceptable. Then no hotel - after we were told we would have a hotel at the location we were laying over in once we get there. 12:30am and we all have to fight to get them to give us a hotel like we were promised since it was a maintenance issue. Today get to airport early, flight cancelled due to maintenance, now setting on a plane waiting for fuel and a restroom that we were told doesn’t work! Now we are told another maintenance issue exists and we are delayed again! Will never fly American again after my points are used!

### "had a great experience"
Toronto to New York La Guardia. Quick 1 hour flight. I found the seat on the E145 to be more comfortable than that on the Air Canada Rouge 767, which is good. Staff were very helpful, overall had a great experience.

### "Don’t fly American"
Philadelphia to Myrtle beach. Sat on the tarmac while pilot told us weather was bad. Flight cancelled and returned to gate. Rebooked 24 hours later. No one offered meal or hotel. Turns out it was not weather but a technical issue. Why can airlines lie and get away with it? Don’t fly American.

### "Why did I pay extra"
❌ Not Verified |  Mazatlan  to Dallas Ft.Worth. The plane had only 1 working bathroom which resulted in the aisle being blocked for almost the entire flight. This is unsafe and inconveniet. When I checked in, even though I paid extra for my ticket to be able to have a carry on, they made me check it. I told them I didn't want to because I had medicine in it. They told me to take the meds out and check it. Why did I pay extra for my ticket?

### American Eagle customer review
Never fly this airline. They failed two times to tell me I was standby on the next flight and the next day also. My handicapped friend & I waited five hours to be told that. I could have booked another airline or drove to JFK for my connecting flight on British Airways. I was surprising my daughter for mother's day, flying back with her to Lebanon. Approx $1200 later I am rescheduling until Sept after driving from Michigan to Cleveland so my sister would care for my animals. Terrible, no response from them.

### 2marked decline in reliability"
College Station to Washington via Dallas. I have flown out of College Station for six years. I have noticed a marked decline in the reliability and on-time performance of the American Eagle flights in the past year or so. I have flown four times in the past couple of months, and each time the flight was delayed at least an hour. Today I scheduled a connection with an extra hour of connection time, but it is not enough. I am going to miss the connection. I fly internationally quite often and have given up trying to fly American Eagle for those trips, because missing the connection is not something you can recover from. The thing I hate the most is the way they say, delayed 20 minutes. Then delayed an hour. Then delayed an hour and 10 minutes. Then delayed two hours. etc. If the delay were at least estimated with a little more accuracy, then a person could make plans. The problem is that the planes are so ancient that there are constant maintenance problems. This airline, like nearly all US carriers, is a mess. It is just terrible. If I had any choice at all about travel, I would not fly American Airlines, but in my town there are very limited options. Unfortunately American Eagle does not give a darn about its quality of service. The ground crew in CLL just shrugs their shoulders. Not their fault.

### "never fly American Airlines"
Louisville to Dallas. We arrived at the airport at 416pm because our flight was set to leave at 635 PM. The boarding pass at first was not confirmed at the ticket desk. The staff had to go get a supervisor. He said she could not find it because my flight had been changed to depart at 8pm. Instead of gate 29 we were now 49. We walked to 49. I looked at my phone and at 417pm and got an alert starting the flight would be late. I was already at the ticket desk by then. Then after sitting for two hours next to gate 49 they announced my flight gate had changed to 1. I have a fused foot and if my daughter had not been with me I would not have made that walk with my luggage in time. I will never fly American Airlines or its affiliates ever again.

### "cramped into the shuttle bus"
After the 50 passengers were cramped into the shuttle bus, we were told the pilot requested mechanics to deal with a technical issue and we would have to wait a "couple of minutes". 10 min later, with doors closed it was hard to breath. The driver cranked the AC to full blast and opened the doors and now we were freezing. After 30 min standing in a cold, packed bus, we were told we would go back to the terminal. Another 10 min later the issue was solved by an off duty mechanic, and we were lucky to be on our way. In short, it was disrespectful, and a health hazard experience.

### "Generally unfriendly service"
This was a top to bottom terrible experience with American Eagle. I usually fly Delta and now know why. This flight was booked for me for business. Generally unfriendly service especially by gate staff that either seem inexperienced or poorly trained. 1 to 1.5 hour delays on O'Hare-Wichita both ways, with a 20 min wait on tarmac at O'Hare from CVG due to no boarding tunnel driver. 3 gate changes at O'Hare within 45 min. Late arrival, arrived at hotel after mignight for AM talk. Coming home, was reassured connection would be no problem, then progressive delays and missed connection. Was told by attendant there would be customer service agent to rebook and arrange hotel, but there was none. Gate staff was grumpy and blithely said no hotel because was weather delay, then I asked her to confirm, she reluctantly called and confirmed it was mechanical. Took 15 min to get hotel voucher 30 min away and told could call for shuttle, called hotel and they said no shuttle and airline "always does that". Returned to gate and another 15 for cab voucher, still had to cover tip. Hotel at midnight, rebooked for 8am flight. Meal voucher $7 did not cover meal at airport. Flight itself was average enough, arrived safely. Given option, would not travel on American again.

### "I couldn't pick a seat"
Albany to Chicago. This plane is clean and attendants pleasant. But I'm upset with the fact I couldn't pick a seat and I am assigned the last seat 18 that does recline. I have a health issues where I would have never chosen this seat. This plane is small and cramped. For where I'm destined I could have picked my usual airline but was suggested by the IT company that is flying me out to pick this one or another airline. I am sadly disappointed. If I can avoid this airline in the future I will. Seat comfort is zero. The lower part of the back indents in so I am hunched forward in this seat that can't recline.

### "hated their jobs and were lazy"
Monroe to Dallas Ft Worth. I have never in my adult life had the flight attendants be so lazy. They were nice, but when it was time for beverages, they not only left out the part where they tell you what they have, by they requested that everyone keep their order to one drink per person (it came off rude). Then the gal walked through with a box holing the snacks and just put it in front of each passanger to get their own snack and then they came through with the drink cart, once my snack was already almost gone. And then why I was surprised, but they came over the speaker to tell everybody to put their shades down, before we landed, so the plane wouldn't get hot. Never have I ever felt like the flight attendants hated their jobs and were lazy.

### "they allowed overbooking"
Chicago to Toronto, they allowed overbooking - resulted in finding volunteers in current flight to move to next flight and resulted in delaying. I was very surprised by the fact that they allowed overbooking, and they had to find 4 volunteers to move to the next flight. The crew member mentioned that the current flight will not be going anywhere until they find volunteers to move to the next flight. Is this a joke? It's a simple math that if the flight is full, they should not take any more customers, but it happened. Not only this delayed the departure time, they provided no compensation whatsoever for people who waited to meet their schedule; this is outrageous. They are ruthless when it comes to customers being late to board on the flight, and if it's other way around, they want our patience - very frustrating. Another problem was that the flight landed in Cleveland to fuel their gas. This was very upsetting because this implies that they did not fully fuel their gas to get to Toronto. I can't stop myself thinking that they can't do math. This delayed another 2 hours or so, and we finally landed to Toronto at 5:00 pm, instead of 2:31 pm. I have nothing more to say about this airplane other than it's stupid and lazy. Only good thing to talk about is that the flight crew lady on the plane was very nice and tried her best to keep us calm. She needs a raise for covering others' problems.

### "check their punctuality!"
Montreal to New York JFK. Please be aware before buying a ticket with this airline, check their punctuality!. This particular flight seems to be almost always delayed by close to 90 minutes. I found out through checking Flightstats that this flight (and apparently many more) in the last 12 consecutive days: - 9 of 12 days has been delayed for more than 90 minutes (up to 184 minutes) - 2 of 12 days was cancelled and only on ONE day out of 12 days actually arrrived at the scheduled time ETA. If your travel or work schedule depends on this, choose another connection. AA does not reemburse bought tickets for their proven inability to comply with ticketed departure and arrival times. I had to buy a second ticket to leave Montreal 3 hours earlier.

### "Fairly standard flights"
Stewart-Newburgh to Toronto via Philadelphia. Fairly standard flights on American Eagle. The flight crew were OK (with one on PHL-YYZ being particularly friendly) and the Valet service for carry on bags works well. The wonderful thing for me was that these flights were on time (as I had tracked them for several weeks before flying and they were often late). The seats and legroom on these smaller aircraft is quite tight.

### "What a shambles"
We are from Australia and flew American Eagle for first time. Never again. We got on the plane in Charleston to fly to Miami after a 2 hour delay. Got to the runway and sat for 30 minutes with nobody telling us anything. Eventually pilot said the plane was too heavy and we needed to return to gate. As there was another plane already there we had to sit on the tarmac for another 20 mins. We eventually got back to the gate where they asked 8 passengers to volunteer to get off. 8 people volunteered and got off. 20 mins later they returned and they started taking fuel off the plane instead. What a shambles. Over 3 hrs late the plane took off. After complaining to American Eagle they offered us a $50 voucher valid for 12 months. I said we live in Australia it's no good to us as we won't be back here for a while. Take it our leave it they said. First time we have flown with American Eagle. Never again. They are a disaster.

### "Very disorganized and chaotic "
Toronto to Charlotte. Very disorganized and chaotic at the boarding gate in Toronto. Delayed 90 minutes deleting. Maintenance. No food or what're nearby (Gate A9). Nearest food/refreshment A19. On arrival 15 minute delay at arrival gate - no gate agent. Really? The inability to get the easy things causes me to question the company's ability to execute safely.

### "unpleasant all around"
Los Angeles to San Francisco. I'm a platinum level member of American Airlines. I travel the SFO to LAX with return flight almost weekly. 2017 they made changes subbing out the short flights to American eagle. American eagle is already inconvenient due to the shuttle bus you have to take from the main terminals. Everything is slow and experience is unpleasant all around. So far this year 4 of 4 flights have had significant mechanical plane failures where I've been delayed up to three hours at a time. Unless AA changes these routes to normal planes in and out of terminal four at LAX they are going to lose a very valuable customer.

### "satisfactory experience"
Houston to Chicago. This was a codeshare flight with Etihad. Had a smooth checkin and courteous check in staff at IAH Houston. I lnked the aircraft as it was my first Embraer aircraft experience, just a basic aircraft with no frills and hype. 2x2 seat configuration and was served a coke and pretzels. Overall a satisfactory experience with American Eagle.

### "worst experience ever"
Ft Walton to Albany via Washington. The attitude of the person at the desk was inapproprate. The airline overbooked the flight and was asking for a person to come forward and take a later flight. Why airlines overbook I'll never know but his attitude was really nasty. He said in an annoyed voice that if no one came forward it will delay the flight and everyone would miss there connecting flight. Sounded like a threat to me and many other people. Secondly to make your connecting flight you have to be bused from the plane to a waiting area and then bused back. People wind up standing - on the bus both ways, in the waiting area etc. I fortunately had check my bag at Ft. Walton but those that did not have to get their luggage and bring it on the bus both ways. What a mess. Will never fly American again. Worst experience ever and I fly quite often!

### "if you can avoid American"
Check-in was smooth. Staff nice for the most part. Seats are uncomfortable. All flights have been delayed, or cancelled. Flying back to Manchester (NH) flight was delayed and weren't able to fly back until 3 days later, staff did not handle, and we were yelled at. We decided to fly JetBlue to Boston the next day and rent a car to drive to Manchester. We didn't get a refund, or money, or credits, for staying at the airport hotel overnight, the JetBlue flight or the rental car. If you can avoid American.

### "delayed again, then canceled"
Avoid American Eagle at all costs. I live near Roanoke and most of my flights have to go through American Eagle. I have lived in the area for 3 years and never had an on time flight with them. The last time I flew with them, they canceled my flight at boarding time "because there weren't enough people", and I swore them off. I had no choice today, however, and now I'm typing this from a hotel in Charlotte after my flight was delayed, then delayed again, then canceled.

### "a vast contrast"
Flew American Eagle from Columbus to New York. There is a vast contrast between flying American Airlines mainline and American Eagle. American Eagle (AE) is to be avoided if you have any other option, especially if your route uses one of their old embraer or bombardier planes that insist on gate checking roll on bags, CRJ700, ERJ140 and ERJ145. American Airlines mainline are my airline of choice especially when flying internationally. I fly AE in and out of Columbus frequently to connect with the AA mainline international flights. I used to book Delta Connect (DC) flights on separate tickets to avoid AE but the DC schedules changed making that option impractical. As examples, with AE you have a 50/50 chance of arriving in Columbus and having to wait a couple of hundred yards back from the gate for about 10 minutes until the below wing ground handlers saunter out of their break room to marshall the aircraft onto stand. You can then wait an average of 15-20 minutes to have your gate checked bag delivered back to the jet bridge. DC normally do this in under 3 minutes for the same aircraft type. If you hold check a bag you better allow yourself a full 45 minutes before it will be delivered on the carousel. With any weather disruptions anywhere in the AA network they will delay and cancel the AE flights, especially the flights in and out of their 2nd tier bases, to the benefit of the mainline and hub flights. Then you will get a shrug of the shoulders from their staff and a statement that because it is weather related the airline bears no responsibility for any delays etc.. You will have about a 20% chance of a maintenance issue on any given flight with this older fleet. Normally it will take 20 minutes to fix the issue and then typically an hour to update the maintenance logbook before you journey can continue. It is unfortunate that the AE below wing operations are so bad as their above wing staff do appear to hustle and to be nice to the passengers.

### "gave a snack and beverage service"
Phoenix to Bakersfield with American Eagle. Very quick flight 1 hour and 10 minutes. It was on time departure and arrival. Planes are the smaller ones like 25 seats. I had a aisle seat. It was fine for economy and the size of the plane. Comfortable flight. Flight attendant gave a snack and beverage service. Nice to have a service from Bakersfield to Phoenix. Both ways the plane is plenty full.

### "extremely rude to us"
Coming back from Phoenix to Des Moines over spring break. Tried to check in curb side (as others were already doing). No one seemed to know what was going on. We were told to go the the guy next to one lady. He sent us back to her. They were both extremely annoyed with us. Then she sent us back to him and he said his computer wasn't working to go inside and check in. There were several people outside that were able to check in except for us. They were extremely rude to us. Went inside to check in and it was compete chaos. The check in computers were not very user friendly. Everyone working seemed extremely stressed out. Finally got up to the gate and once again they were stressed out saying they were short of help. The seats on the planes both going to and coming home were the most uncomfortable seats that we have ever had to sit in. Will definitely avoid American if possible.

### "wonderful in-flight staff"
No overhead space to speak of, wonderful in-flight staff. Flight on time, and very comfortable seats. These planes are really too small for people of my stature. It is very sad what American Airlines has done to STL, with sad and disgruntled staff.

### "service is extremely basic"
Flew American Eagle from Albuquerque - Los Angeles and return. I decided to pay the extra for First Class because I wanted the sole seat 2A. The seat is very comfortable and there's plenty of space. The flight crews and cabin crews were great. Very friendly and helpful. The service though is extremely basic. No food only nuts, chips and cookies. It would be nice to offer the First Class passengers some sandwiches at the very least. The tickets are very expensive and there is nothing special about the on board 'fare'. The wi-fi on board is good but it is also not complimentary, you have to pay. Again, why not offer that for free to First Class passengers? On the ground in LA I was told that I could not use the Admirals Lounge because it is not for "First Class domestic passengers". Again the ticket is very expensive and I don't understand why domestic First Class cannot use the lounges. Dollars per mile, I am sure that American makes more money on their domestic First Class than on their international routes. I had to extend my trip and when I changed my ticket I was charged an additional $358.00!!! Outrageous! So, my ticket ended up costing over $1,200! I will think twice about flying with American when booking my next flight. They only seem interested in making money and not customer satisfaction.

### "experience was mediocre "
This is a short 30 min flight from ORD to IND, last leg of our long trip. The interior of the plane was horrible. There was no service, they said at the beginning, if we want something, call the attendants, but they will not go through the aircraft. All in all we got to the destination, but the overall experience was mediocre at best with indifferent staff.

### "inflight experience not good"
Salt Lake City to Los Angeles was the worst experience among our four American Airline/American Eagle flights. I tried to change my Frequent Flyer Number on the self-service kiosk but it didn't work, so I ask one of their check-in lady to do that when she was printing our baggage labels. But I just found out that she did not change it at all as this flight counted in my BA program rather than my CX program I ask her to change. Secondly, the flight was delayed due to technical issue. Which was all fine because people understand that it is for the sake of their lives. However, the AA maintenance in Salt Lake City was so inefficient as it took them more than 40 minutes to arrive at the aircraft and commence the problem shooting. After delayed for about 2 hours, we started to board. However that is not the end, after all passengers took their seats, we have two passengers who did not show up but the aircraft was full. Ground services and the flight attendants counted the number for more than 5 times and decided it was ok. Unfortunately there seemed to be another technical problem which held us for another 30 minutes. The total delay was more than 3 hours and the inflight experience was not good either, both lavatories were out of function shortly after beverage service. My personal opinion towards the AA domestic flight is that it depends on luck if they delay, cancel your flight or lost track of you baggage.

### "great legroom"
San Francisco to Los Angeles. On time and quick and efficient at check in and at the boarding gate. Great legroom because we somehow got put into the extra legroom seats. Comfy seat for the quick one hour flight down to LAX. I was shocked as an Australian there is no  proper welcome when you step onboard the plane directing you to your seat. For takeoff and landing in Australia you must have the window shade up, but as we were coming in to land in LAX not one of the cabin crew came and asked to open the window shade. I could recline in economy during takeoff and landing.

### "flight a little rough"
Charlotte to Coastal Carolina Regional. The flight attendant was less than desired. We had quite a few older passengers on this flight and she couldn't help them up the steps, saying I can't leave the plane. We had passengers in row 3 or 4 get sick and she couldn't get up to help them saying the crew told her to stay seated. We had passengers getting up to use the bathroom and the only time the flight attendant got up was to find a ring on the floor of the cabin between rows 3 and 4. She never made an announcement she had found the ring or anything. No beverage service, flight a little rough at times but I've had service with rougher air.

### "American Eagle should be ashamed"
We had booked a direct flight from Philadelphia, PA to Jacksonville, FL so we could spend time with our family for Thanksgiving. American Eagle diverted our flight to Washington, DC Reagan and we were made to use shuttle buses from Philadelphia to the terminal going to Reagan. The shuttle buses were dangerously overcrowded and disgusting. The plane a small 50 seat plane was completely filled. My wife and I are senior citizen and I am glad we took baby aspirin before our flight because they very tight seats caused our legs to throb. We met many individuals who complained bitterly about the seat space. Once at Reagan our connecting flight required shuttle buses to the terminal and these were overfilled. There was a mother standing with her infant trying to manage the child and stroller. There was my wife and I just trying to stand. I counted more then 70 people on a bus designed to safely carry 50. This plane held about 90 passengers and was filled to capacity. Carry ons had to be checked, because the overhead compartments were unable to accommodate the newly approved carry on luggage. The flight was a horror and took much longer then the direct flight we had booked. The plane was dirty and disgusting. For a Thanksgiving holiday American Eagle should be ashamed.

### "runs a pretty good operation "
It is my impression that American Eagle runs a pretty good operation out of Chicago O'Hare. I must admit that although ORD was a complete mess due to a prior snowstorm, the American employees we dealt with did a great job helping us out. The flight down to Louisville from Chicago was fine, good service, arrived on time clean plane etc. The return flight to Chicago O'Hare was in the weather the entire one hour so no drinks etc. Crew did a good job. I have no complaints with this operation - using O'Hare though does tend to try ones patience - too many people. Next time I will try Nashville and drive north instead.

### "3 strikes and a bad review"
After being forced to purchase tickets via this airline for the third time I was again disappointed. 3 strikes and you get a bad review AA. First flight I had no assigned seating and flight delayed 2nd time I had my luggage missing for 24hours. Now this this 3rd time I have a delayed flight For a weekend trip that sets me back on my job and plans for my wife and I. I wish this airline would just go away, so something else could take its place. You get what you pay for here but it is not always the cheapest, so 2/10 value, Ground service - non existent in my case. Seat comfort is average for an average sized male. Cabin staff - considering how much they hate their job not bad.

### "service was adequate"
The service was adequate, food (beef salad) was adequate. Equipment old and tired. Cabin crew friendly. However, there appears to be something jinxed about this flight. Second time in 18 months we have flown this route and both times significant delays. This time it was 90 minutes. The frustrating aspect was the number of gate changes; six of them (three of them in the last 60 minutes before departure), the same number as the last time.

### "I was pleasantly surprised"
This was my first time flying on American Eagle, and first time on a smaller ERJ175 jet. I was pleasantly surprised at how nice these planes fly. Seemed to be quieter than a Boeing 737 I am so used to flying on. It was also nice that there are only 2 seats across on both sides, and only 75 passengers. This makes embarking and disembarking much quicker. The full flight loaded in 15 minutes and left on time. Beware though, smaller plane means smaller overhead luggage bins, which means carry ons that fit easily in a 737 for example, might be a tight squeeze on this plane. I slept on the flight and missed service. There is no on board entertainment on these planes, just wifi which I did not connect to. I was in a main cabin extra seat, and honestly, I didnt notice the extra space. I am short so it really is not a factor. However, it was a benefit to be among group 1 boarding and towards the front of the plane.

### "planes were never on time"
I have flown with American Airlines / American Eagle 6 times within the past 6 months. Only one of these flights were on time, I experienced 2 cancellations and the other flights have all been delayed by 1+ hours, causing me to miss connection flights. Compensation for cancelled flights are ridiculous, either a partial refund, a flight the next day (with no complimentary hotel), or a flight to a nearby city (with no ground transportation to original city). American Eagle planes were never on time and their ground crew just don't care.

### "was good value for money"
Short American Eagle flight from Washington Ronald Regan to Chicago O'Hare. It wasn't perfect, the boarding gates were "hidden" downstairs, we were transported to the bus via bus, which was waiting definitely too long. From the other hand the plane was small, so it surely wasn't priority. Crew was okay, non-alcoholic drinks were served. Comfort was acceptable. For the price I paid (70USD) it was good value for money.

### "just goes from bad to worse"
It just goes from bad to worse with this airline. Check in for flight go to gate and assured flight is on time - shortly before flight is to leave announcement that pilot has not arrived! 10 minutes later with no announcement the flight is cancelled and mayhem ensures - cannot fault the ticketing people who did their best in a bad situation but initially suggested leave date would be 2 days from now. I have a flight to London tomorrow night after much polite conversation eventually get on a flight tomorrow lunchtime - American is not a great airline to fly with at present! Disappointed.

### "service was good and I'll fly again"
Flight left Albuquerque on time, early morning departure. Crew was super, provided good but limited service. Arrived Dallas/Ft Worth on time. Flight was on a CRJ-900 and I was disappointed the overhead bins were so small and could not accept my downsized briefcase. It had to be checked to DFW. I was concerned the whole trip since the bag was checked and it contained all the things we want to carry with us and not check. However, the bag was delivered planeside. The service was good and I'll fly American Eagle again but will make every effort to avoid their CRJ-900 with the small overhead bins.

### American Eagle customer review
Unbelievably high quality experience from this carrier. Boarded promptly, crew very helpful in terms of getting carry on bags stowed into very small overhead bins. Can't remember the last time a flight attendant actually helped get a bag stowed instead of being critical of my efforts. Five stars to the flight attendant in first class. Flight left a few minutes early, arrived fifteen minutes early. Had a truly excellent lunch, would have been pleased to pay for it. Couldn't remember the last time that happened on a US carrier. Hope that this signals a new era at American Eagle.

Flew from ORD to SDF First Class, great flight quite a new aircraft too. Service was excellent and the first class seating is comfortable in a 1x2 configuration. The hour long flight departed on time with pre flight cocktails with additional cocktails and snacks offered once airborne. Crew were professional and attentive throughout the flight.

### American Eagle customer review
Excellent flight with great service provided by the cabin crew. Drinks served prior to take off, and during the flight too. The new larger aircraft on this route make a difference too for a much improved flight experience. On time departure and arrival too, which allowed a better connection for my transatlantic flight to London.

9/6/15, GRR-ORD, CRJ-700, First Class, seat 1A. Booked with BA Avios Points. Short flight to get to Chicago to connect to BA flight home. Welcomed onboard and offered a Pre Departure Drink. Seat was comfortable with plenty of Room. Crew were great and offered a drink and a snack on this short 30 min flight.

### American Eagle customer review
Terrible experience all around. Flight delayed three hours, no place to hang my dress uniform and generally terrible/confrontational service. If these people spent half the time they do berating customers actually doing their jobs correctly maybe they wouldn't have such a terrible track record with customer service. If I have a choice next time I won't fly with them, I don't even care if it costs more.

I flew from Chicago ORD airport to Houston IAH on Monday May 25th. The flight left on time and arrived to Houston early. The flight was good because there aren't many seats onboard this plane so check in and leaving is much quicker than on normal flights.

Without fail the American Eagle connection between DFW to Tyler or the Houston connection to Tyler is always a 3-4 hour layover. This time 30th March was the worst - went from gate B-1 to B-15 for connection and 30 minutes later I was told it was now gate 36. Caught a tram for that but after 30 minutes felt something was wrong checked monitor and found out it was back at Gate 18? Then could tell there was some confusion from those running the desk. There was a co-pilot but no pilot and flight attendant. Finally they showed up and starting boarding late then sat for a while because of some paper work problem which must have been the pilot. Then sat for a while longer. We finally took off but this is always the case catching these connections to Tyler every time. From now on I'll be driving from Dallas or Houston.

Flew from Greensboro NC to DFW. Flight was supposed to leave around 6 pm on 9/28. After waiting until after 8 we were told the lav was not working and we would be given vouchers and fly out at 7.30 the next morning. We were not helped to find transportation to our hotel although it was late on a Sunday evening and the airport was closing down. We finally got to our hotel at 9.45. Left the next morning at 6 but didn't take off until 8.30 - were told the bathroom issues were still not fixed and we would have to land in Memphis for people who needed a bathroom break. We were forced to deplane take all our luggage off then told there were hydraulic problems. We finally left Memphis after 1 and landed at DFW after 3. The people in Greensboro were not helpful nor did we ever feel that we were given accurate information about what was going on. A miserable experience.

### American Eagle customer review
For the past two years I've been flying American Eagle several times a month between St. Louis and Washington DC (DCA) and the service has steadily declined in quality and reliability. At least half of the flights are late (some several hours) and a number have been cancelled (including several evening flights requiring an overnight stay at my expense). I've tolerated this mediocre service because of convenience (and a distaste for Southwest) but yesterday upon landing at DCA the new gate arrangement has pushed me to Southwest. Now instead of boarding/deplaning at a terminal gate the aircraft parks away from the terminal and passengers are transported to the terminal - a process that takes 20-30 minute (not to mention the hassle of standing outside the aircraft on the tarmac waiting for carry-on luggage). I have also heard flight attendants and gate agents confirm the poor operations of this carrier. Fly with American Eagle at your risk.

### American Eagle customer review
Was flying from Flint to Tulsa through Chicago on American Eagle. Arrived well within the check in window but the airport ticket agents were short staffed the guy who was supposed to be at the American Eagle desk was servicing United Airlines. He informed me he could help me when he was done which was 30 min after my plane took off. He blamed me for being to the counter late and when processing my new flight changed my final destination to Tuscon instead of Tulsa. Luckily I caught it before being stranded in Chicago and my bags in Tuscon. There were no additional flights that day so its back home and try again tomorrow. I will give Flint a second try but not American Eagle.

### American Eagle customer review
Flight booked in Feb. for a vacation in July. We arrived early at airport and checked bags at 12.00 for a flight that was scheduled to board at 6.10 pm. Traveling with my 2 daughters. When we presented our boarding passing at 6.10 we were told the flight was overweight and we were selected to be removed. They did not ask if anyone on flight was willing to take a later flight. Just stated we were selected but not told how selection process works. Don't understand why they waited until we were ready to board. Had we been told 30 min earlier we could have caught another flight that day. They would not remove our luggage or anyone elses to make weight. We were put on a flight the next day and had a layover (purchased flight was direct) arrived at final destination a day late and very grumpy. Our luggage did make it a day earlier. Find it hard to believe that they cut it so close that the weight of 2 average people (1 of us could have gone) makes the difference on flight. I would not fly with them again.

### American Eagle customer review
On June 20 2014 flew from Chicago O'Hare to Little Rock. Two hour delay because they had no flight attendant. Chicago ticket agents not friendly. On the return trip (June 23rd) no reason was given for the numerous delays of the original 4.55 pm flight. Around 5.30 we had a plane but it had mechanical problems. This went on for some time then the flight was cancelled. I booked another flight scheduled to leave around 10.15 pm but it was cancelled because the plane coming in wasn't going to get there on time. The ticket agent supervisor very unfriendly and showed no care at all of what we were going through. They did put passengers in hotels but I have family in the area. Next morning the 7.30 am flight delayed because we were told via loudspeaker by the ticket agent on duty that 'someone fell down on the job' and didn't book a crew for the right time. Crew came in about 8.45. When we landed in Chicago there was no jet bridge driver ready to let us off. Needless to say my last American Eagle flight.

### American Eagle customer review
American Eagle is a poor choice of transportation and you should consider alternatives. I arrived at the airport from another flight and waited for 3 hours for my flight. Upon arriving at the airport I checked the boards to double-check that my flight would take off at the same gate as listed on my boarding pass. However when the time came my flight wasn't listed. Upon asking about the flight I was informed that they had changed gates (from B21 to B9 far from my location). However they did not announce any gate changes. I was informed that they don't announce gate changes unless it's less the change is made in the last two hours. Thus I waited 3 hours (with false information) and missed my flight. I had to stay the night in Dallas and fly standby the next morning. Why would an airline consider a policy of not announcing important gate changes?

### American Eagle customer review
We got stranded at Chicago O'Hare due to a missed connecting flight because the incoming flight was 2.5 hours late. We were very tired after a full day of travel and met with stony faced unsympathetic staff at American Eagle Counter at Gate G7. After telling us we would have to spend the night waiting for the next morning flight we were given the bogus reason of weather delay and sent to AA Counter since we were told it was up to AA to handle our case. There were 2 staff personnel dealing with 2 customers and none would agree to accompany us to the AA Counter. It all ended badly with arguments the weather was nice departing in West Palm Beach FL and it was cloudy upon arrival in Chicago - nonetheless our flight came in 2 hours late. We started our day at 9pm in LAX and ended up at that time at 10pm at American Eagle Counter at ORD.

14 April 2014. AA4223 from Chicago to St Louis. The new plane is good. 2x2 seats a line with leather seating. They know the plane is full and there won't be enough space for carry on luggage so encourage people to check in bags for free and pre-board.

I've been stranded in Chattanooga for 2 days with another traveler trying to get to Dallas. I was given the reason of 'weather' and he was told 'mechanical' for cancellation. I will never fly American Eagle again.

### American Eagle customer review
SAT-ORD in brand new Embraer 175 aircraft - got upgraded and had the single seat side in First so that really does help but flight was absolutely great - nice meal and drinks with snack in First class and that was welcome on a 2.5 hour flight departing at 6PM. FA quite friendly and the overhead bins were big enough for roller bags - no gate valet. I must say I think AA are making an on time push as I haven't had a late flight this year and that is already 40 flights.

### American Eagle customer review
I had a flight from Dallas to Chihuahua in Mexico as part of a bigger trip from London to Chihuahua. The timing between flights meant my baggage didn't make it to Chihuahua at the same time as me - and I was travelling on straight away to Urique to take part in an ultra marathon. I was very worried about my baggage catching-up with me given the remote location I was going to - but the American Eagle airline staff were incredibly helpful and as promised the bag arrived with a smiling face beside it two days later in Urique (and Urique is a day of travel by land from Chihuahua). Excellent service.

### American Eagle customer review
I was on the red eye from LAX to IAH business (first) class: tiny canadair jet which is fine however it would be nice if it had been cleaned: the armrest still had food debris from the previous flight. I asked the flight attendant for a wet wipe which he provided by almost throwing it at me. Taking our orders by writing on a paper napkin? Never cracked a smile for the entire flight and in the end he was scolding some of us who dared standing up before he decided it was fine to do so so a gentleman in the front row who didn't stand reminded him that a please and thank you would have been appropriate and he replied that the crew orders must be obeyed at all times. The food was OK but nonetheless I cringed when I noticed that with the same tray he collected the dirty refreshing towels and then served tea and coffee. Seats were comfortable for the short flight.

### American Eagle customer review
Very unfriendly attendant at Gate B33 for DFW to MSN flight (3.35 departure) on Oct. 27th. She told my travel partner that she was too busy to deal with him. He was trying to fly standby on an earlier flight. So my friend sat down and waited then went back up to the desk 10-15 minutes before the flight left and she told him he should have asked someone else to help him and that she couldn't help him this close to the flight departure. Flight left with empty seats that he could not get on because this agent just simply didn't want to do her job. Horrible service. Very unfriendly rude agent. I would never fly American Eagle.

Flew American Eagle from Newark to ORD. Flight went well. Flight attendants were very friendly. Flight was delayed by half an hour and they never made any announcements though leaving us confused in the terminal. Once in the air everything was smooth and no problem. Comfortable chairs on this particular airplane and only 2 on each side so no middle seats.

A short hop from Grand Rapids to O'Hare on an EMB140. Cramped interior with narrow seats and overhead lockers on one side only. Late departure and early arrival with a water service offered on the 40 min journey by a friendly cabin attendant.

### American Eagle customer review
RDU-LGA/JFK-RDU in economy on American Eagle in an EMB 140. I am gold with Delta and never fly American; however I was satisfied with the customer service on the ground in all airports. However the in-flight experience was dreadful. Thank goodness I was only on the plane one hour otherwise these tiny ancient dirty decrepit airplanes would make anyone go crazy. The seats are narrow even on the single aisle side. The ceilings are very low possibly barely 6 feet or less. There is little or no overhead storage room so don't think about bringing an overnight case like you would on a normal plane. You will be forced to check them at the gate. FA's were fine as was the standard beverage service.

### American Eagle customer review
My experience with American Eagle is usually satisfactory. However on a return flight from Dallas to Waco on June 16 we were forced to change boarding gates "five" times. The flight was full so this group of people herded back and forth chasing gate changes for hours. The flight left 2 hours late. Not a pleasing experience. I am an AAdvantage customer and was not happy.

My husband and I flew from Charlotte NC to Chicago Il on June 7 2013. On this particular day there were thunder storms and high winds all up and down the east coast. While we were waiting one flight had to return to the airport because of the weather and another was cancelled. Our flight was a bit late and had to circle the airport for a while waiting to land - all due to the weather. Though our flight was a little late we made up time in flight and landed almost the time we were supposed to land. Though the plane was small it was comfortable. Our carry on baggage was put under the plane just before boarding and collected again as we left. Overall it was a pleasant experience. We were pleased.

1st flight YYZ-JFK cancelled. Had to rebook and scramble to get an earlier flight so we didn't miss our connection to BCN. 2nd flight JFK-YYZ delayed 1 hr then 2hrs then 3hrs then 4hrs. Made to sit at the gate for updates that never came. Told we were missing a captain. Told captain was coming "at his leisure" by the gate agents. Told we were receiving no announcements over the PA because there was nothing to announce.

PIT-ORD 10-Jun-2013: Missed connection to NRT Japan due to malfunctioning landing (would not retract) due to pilot having to return to departing airport (PIT). Could not get an acceptable flight to connecting airport (ORD). Plane also had 3 non-functional seats which caused gate agent to announce that the flight was in an "over- booked" situation. This was most definitely my worst flying experience in over 40 years of business travel. Will not book on American Eagle again!

Travel often between Nassau Bahamas and Miami. Stopped flying them for many years. Delayed flights cancelled flights luggage often does not come on flight. Last night June 2 2013 topped them all. Returning from vacation in D.R. on American had to get on American Eagle 3470 to get home to Nassau. 9.05pm scheduled flight. Around 8pm they posted that it was delayed 9.30. Then around 8.45pm they posted that the flight was delayed until 1.30am agent said they were waiting for crew! They are disorganized rude and never tell a straight story. I was able to get a hotel room in Miami and they booked me on Bahamas Air the next morning. Found out they ended up completely cancelling this flight. Some people sat there waiting until after 1am until they were finally told the flight was cancelled. This is such a common occurrence especially from my past experience with American Eagle.

JFK-YUL flying an Embraer 1x2 rows. Using American airline JFK flagship lounge it is probably the best American lounge. I have been told I must go to gate at 8.50 for 9.30 flight. Well I was there by 8.30 pm waited until 9.15 pm I have been told the flight delay because crew is not on board. Another 30 minutes I walked to the counter again and I have been told engineers are on board fixing problems. By 10.45 pm I went to the counter again and I have been told there is another plane will arrive in 10 minutes and they will change aircraft. 11pm the pilots walked out the arrived plane and ready to go home. Half way the terminal one ground staff called them back and after some phone calls pilots back on the plane again. 11.20 boarding started 11.45 took off at JFK. Cabin crew only did safety demo and hand out landing card. No drinks or anything served. Pilot just said try to get to Montreal as fast as he can. We landed at YUL 1am. From the beginning to the end not one person apologised for the delay. I will try to avoid this airline in the future.

### American Eagle customer review
Miami to Atlanta flying an Embraer. 1x2 rows. No storage for carry on inside the plane. They made us walk thru the rain to board the aircraft. The flight took off more than an hour late. Price was USD350 but they don't even give a full can of coke. I tried to purchase a snack but they don't accept my American Airlines credit card. Very uncomfortable seat. I would avoid American eagle in my future flights.

### American Eagle customer review
DCA-JFK-DCA CRJ 700. High marks for operating on a forecast heavy snow day when many other airlines cancelled. Weather turned out to be fairly mild at both DCA and JFK that day. This is commuter regional service and works well only for a flight of no longer than 1.5 hours each way (approx. 250 miles). I connected at JFK to a Cathay Pacific international flight. CRJ 700 aircraft on both segments were quite new very quiet clean and reasonably comfortable in First Class. Yet the so-called First Class seat offers nothing with no leg rest or entertainment system. All standard carry-on bags must be valet checked and causes delays at the destination especially if connecting quickly to another flight. A beverage was served and a small bag of trail mix was given outbound but only given to me on the inbound flight because I asked. American Eagle gate counters tend to be a bit chaotic especially at JFK as several flights board from the same gate entrance. Both flights were on time the flight attendants were reasonably friendly and my checked luggage delivered without too much delay. Overall this is the most basic way to connect by air (even in so-called First Class) between two airports that are about 250 miles apart. On this trip the flights worked very efficiently for that purpose only. I would not want to fly on a commuter regional jet for a longer trip.

### American Eagle customer review
Original flight out of Fresno was 9.15am at approx. 8.30 the sign was changed to delayed to 10.30. At approx. 10.00 it was changed to delayed to 2.20pm and we were told to go back to the front counter and get our tickets renewed. Stood in line for 2 hours and then had to go through customs for the second time same long line. At approx. 1.50pm we were told flight was cancelled and that we all had to go back to the front desk again and get rescheduled for another flight. After standing in line again for a couple of hours we finally got tickets for a flight the next day. They did supply us with a room for the night but no transportation to get there. They gave us a coupon for supper for $12.00 and $7.00 for breakfast - what a joke. Did make it home the next day.

ORD-CVG. They delayed my wife's flight by 5.5 hours after the flight landed because the crew were not ready. I have used them only twice and they delayed flights not because of weather both the times. A very unreliable airline.

### American Eagle customer review
I got delayed for a day in Dallas-Ft. Worth due to snow there on a Phoenix to Kansas trip. Granted it was Christmas Day and employees could have been short-handed but frankly American seemed quite unprepared to deal with the chaos and re-scheduling necessities that ensued. Customers were obliged to wait in long lines to re-schedule with few ticketing or gate agents to assist them. Next day was worse with no more employees in sight to handle the customers. Gate staff were swamped and customers departing to different destinations were on top of one another at the same gate awaiting delayed flights. Fortunately I encountered helpful American Airlines and airport staff that humanized the experience and assisted me.

### American Eagle customer review
RT from MLI to LEX involving connection at ORD each way. I have been flying for 45 years - this is without question the worst possible round-trip experience I have had. We were 90 minutes late leaving MLI (first flight of the morning) due to problems with a thrust reverser. Had a 45 minute wait. Overheard the pilot tell another passenger what the problem was - why was there never an announcement to the rest of the passengers? As a result we arrived ORD 15 min too late to make the connection. Next flight to LEX was 6 hours later and was sold out - next possible seats were 9 hours later. American did agree to let us travel to Louisville (SDF) instead but had to rent a car with a hefty drop charge. Finally arrived in Lexington 3.5 hours later than planned. Return trip a few days later was worse - left LEX and arrived ORD on time. Had a 2.5 hour layover. The time came to board with no announcement. 30 minutes later told the aircraft had landed and we would board "shortly". Another 30 minutes passed and the gate was changed requiring a hike down the concourse. Finally boarded 2.5 hours after original departure time. Clearly there were mechanical issues at work and AA does not want to admit to them. I would avoid this airline completely in the future but unfortunately their competition is equally indifferent to passengers and equally incompetent.

### American Eagle customer review
GDL-LGA via DFW: I had two American Eagle flights on last week's trip from GDL to LGA via DFW. The flight to DFW from GDL was on a plane with 2 seats on one side of the aisle and 3 on the other. I had one of the 2 seats. The seat was fine and there was no one sitting beside me. Overall the flight was comfortable and the distance between the seats appeared to me to be somewhat greater than I have seen in coach on a major rival carrier. The flight was half-empty. The return flight from DFW to GDL was on an Embraer with 1 seat on one side of the aisle and 2 abreast on the other side. I was in the single seat. This flight was full. A smooth flight with a smooth landing.

### American Eagle customer review
IAH to LAX. This was a pretty standard flight. The plane was small and the seats were uncomfortable feels like taking the bus but for a short flight it is hard to complain too much. The plane was a commuter with 2 sets on 1 side of the aisle and 1 on the other. I am 6'5 so my knees constantly dug into the seat in front of me and turbulence was painful like most economy class seats. The service staff was among some of the most friendly I have seen on a domestic airline but I'm sure that it varies from flight to flight. Captain displayed good communication with the passengers. Offered the usual non-alcoholic drinks in a small cup. I can't give any airline a good ranking on food and beverage that will charge for a bag of crackers. The flight departed and arrived on time however at LAX American Eagle crams you into a shuttle shoulder to shoulder to go to the main terminals. Overall not a bad experience and I will probably use them next time I fly to LAX.

### American Eagle customer review
I fly American Eagle a couple of times a month on business. The flights are almost always on-time. My only real complaint is the condition of the fleet - they really need to update their planes. The planes are incredibly cramped the seats are hard the storage is non-existent some wi-fi would be great for us business travelers. It's confusing that they accept only cash on board for alcohol/snacks when with most other carriers (including AA) it's the other way around. Still it's much better than UA Express to name one other regional carrier I've flown with recently.

### American Eagle customer review
Four flights. First and second leg out were fine no problems and on time. Return to Dallas on third leg was also good. Last leg home out of Dallas was to board at 5pm Waiting at gate after 5 and agent announced that the flight crew was late. Captain arrived about 5.15 but no Flight Attendant or First Officer. Substitute FA obtained and was told about 5.30 that FO was due shortly. 6pm still no FO but Captain had us board. Sat in hot plane (101 degrees outside) but FA did distribute water. Captain left cockpit returned around 7 pm and told us to leave the plane as he did not know when the FO would get there. 7.15 substitute FO arrived we re-boarded and lifted off from the runway around 7.40 arriving at our destination around 8.30pm. Plane had to wait for ground crew to finish with a Chicago arrival before we could get to the gate. Off the plane at 8.50.

### American Eagle customer review
Arrived in Nashville from Miami. Frustrating how much bad service they cram into such a short flight. When we got to our gate we were informed without apology that the gate had been changed. Once onboard it was apparent that we would be served with the same lack of professionalism. Having boarded 20 minutes late the pilot made up the time. My wife fell asleep but condensation from the air unit above started dripping on her. The seat front pocket was torn so badly that their included magazines kept spilling out onto the floor. After de-boarding those with gate checked luggage had to line up in the hall and wait for them. I was pleased that mine was second because it turned out that nearly everyone had a gate checked luggage thanks to more or less standard baggage fees. This made for a very messy de-planing. This is a time when companies like American Eagle should be attempting to compensate for their less maintained appearance by upping the ante on customer service. Sadly they are moving in the opposite direction.

### American Eagle customer review
Service was terrible. I flew from LGA to RDU day before yesterday. I had turned on the call light to get assistance. Attendant stood in the aisle talking to the guy a few rows up twice and never came even to ask what I needed. Someone cut the light off 3 times (and I again called). No one ever came to acknowledge the light much less to see what I needed. When on my way out I asked if she had seen my light (trying to give her the benefit of the doubt) she said they couldn't move around when the seatbelt light was on. The fasten seatbelt light wasn't on and she was moving around.

San Diego - Los Angeles - Fresno. All the flights on Embraer 140 which I found roomy and comfortable. Leaving San Diego it was foggy and the gate agent was concerned and put us and other passenger on an earlier flight (the flight we were supposed to be on ended up cancelled). On a short 28 minute flight the flight attendant managed to serve beverages to a full aircraft. Our next flight to Fresno boarded early and left early with only around 10 people on board. Basic flight with a drink service and an early arrival into Fresno. American Eagle crews showed they care about passengers helped us avoid a potentially bad situation.

### American Eagle customer review
LGA-ATL on one of American Eagle's CRJ 700. In addition to a great flight and service what impressed me the most was to be on an American Eagle airplane that had been cleaned prior to departure. Attentive crew members and this service and experience is usually not the norm - but this was a great flight.

### American Eagle customer review
Absolutely appalling. Sat on tarmac for 2hrs 50 mins told staff that I would miss my 1:30am flight to HKG totally indifferent. Wouldn't let us off plane although obvious that we would miss connection. 10 minutes before arriving at Toronto pilot made announcement that Cathay were holding the flight for us - we shot off plane into an empty closed down airport. Cathay had left ages ago and we found out later they will not hold a plane for passengers unless baggage is loaded. Crew lied to us so they wouldn't have to help. We wandered around the closed airport all night and when found AA airline staff were told that we would have to fly back to NY to catch a flight in the afternoon - no compensation whatsoever and arrived in HKG totally exhausted. AA should have met us at gate - we were told later by an AA staff who confided that in her 25 years of work in the airline she had never seen such a decline in customer service. Flight back was also delayed deadheading a pilot - so we waited 3 hours.

### American Eagle customer review
Gainesville to Miami non-stop. Gainesville airport is only serviced by three airlines so my choices were limited. Flight was OK a 64 seat ATR-72 showing its age but in decent shape. The flight was 1hr 20mins but we were still served drinks. American Eagle is good in that you can pick your seat when you book the ticket online unlike some airlines which charge you. A warning though the ATR-72 has overhead bins but they are too small for regular carry-on bags. Things like backpacks and purses will fit but that's about it. If you do have a standard luggage carry on you will check it in right before you get to the plane and once you get off the plane it'll be there waiting for you. The ATR-72 boards from the back of the plane so pick seats in the back and you'll be off the plane first.

### American Eagle customer review
LAX-DEN. Very lucky to make my connection off a QANTAS flight from Australia due to delays in LAX security (even though 2 hours between flights). I made it to the gate but then told that I had to get a bus which wasn't arriving for another 10 minutes. This should be advised somewhere because I was not made aware of this fact. The Eagle terminal is ok but nothing to eat other than vending machines. ERJ140 flight across to Denver was very good - I have flown the ERJ a few times on AE recently and it is very comfortable for a regional jet. Had the single seat on the left hand side next to the aisle - fine for a 2 hour flight. Overall I don't mind flying on the ERJ - it beats a turboprop anyday!

Chicago ORD to YYC on a small CR7 jet. Overhead compartments won't take rollerbags so they have to be gate checked. Seats are small & uncomfortable. Fortunately the flight was less than half full so I sprawled out in the 2 economy seats in my row. The CR7 is too small of a plane to fly 3-4 hrs in. FAs pleasant and attentive enough.

### American Eagle customer review
DCA-JFK as part of international trip. Check in staff extremely rude and abrasive. Wanted to charge for bag even though I was clearly on an international ticket. Problem solved by Admirals Club staff member who was superb and redeemed the flight. Was not warned that small Embraer cannot accommodate carry-ons which lead to delays and confusion during boarding. FA was unfriendly and seemed utterly disinterested in safety demo.

DCA-JFK-DCA ERJ 140. Outbound flight was very good with on-time service an efficient and pleasant flight attendant plus informative crew. The inbound flight left the gate on time at JFK but didn't take off for another hour. Flight attendant provided minimal service. The outbound aircraft was newer but both were clean though the ERJ 140 is not comfortable due to the curvature of the fuselage at floor level. Checked baggage and valet cabin bags were delivered promptly. Overall this regional connector was acceptable for a flight of less than an hour not counting the pre-takeoff delay at JFK. Ticket price was higher than justifiable for this short flight.

DCA-JFK. Truly appalling experience. Apart from the 2.5 hrs delay due to which I missed a connection display of apathy indifference and condescension from multiple employees. The ground staff at DCA couldn't even advise if the incoming plane was in the air or not instead kept drip-feeding announcements of 30 mins delay each time. The lady didn't even have the decency to call JFK and explain my situation. At JFK in the middle of the night no AA staff was to be found finally a supervisor appeared at 5am and just sniggered at my problem of having missed the flight to Korea - not their problem apparently. The plane was shabby dirty and windows were barely kept together with a sticky tape.

XNA-ORD-XNA. First class seats comfortable but overhead storage limited as the singe seat side on CRJ has had the bins removed. 3 Rows of first class on CRJ in a 1+2 format. Under seat storage is ample allowing 2 bags to be brought on board avoiding their annoying valet bag service that can take 30 minutes from landing to complete. In flight drinks and snacks very nice with pleasant FA - Gate agent was awful and tried to stop anyone bringing 2 carryons on (1 personal item and a bag that fits overhead) - young and impetuous. The addition of First Class on their CRJ has been a definite boost for this carrier - even in coach their drink selections have got better. Now I seek out CRJ flights.

ORD-EVV on ERJ-145. Efficient and friendly male flight attendant. Plane small but overall fairly comfortable clean and well maintained. Flight attendant did a round of drinks and came back to offer seconds. On time departure and good service. Not bad for such a short flight.

### American Eagle customer review
I flew American Eagle between San Diego and Los Angeles International to catch an onward flight to London. The service was excellent on this very short flight (27 minutes). The flight attendant was friendly and diligent and made sure that everyone got a drink even though we were landing as soon as we took off. The flight left on time and landed early - can't ask for much more than that.

PHL-ORD-XNA. With a little luck I experienced the new First Class on American Eagle on their CRJ aircraft. I say luck as there is no clue that there would be first class on the flights - seat selection map was as normal - all one class but I happened to pick in the first 3 rows and got a first class seat FA told me that there is no priority given to frequent fliers and I felt that is an oversight by AE to show off their product to their best customers. Seats will be sold as first class from July 1. Seats were very comfortable - in fact the most comfortable American Eagle flights I have had! One downside is the loss of the overhead on the single seat side (there are 3 rows of 1+2) and one of the remaining bins contained an oxygen canister. Maybe AE missed a chance to put some full size bins on the one side? Definitely a step in the right direction for AE and I will no longer avoid their CRJ aircraft (as I do the Embraer).

CLE-LGA JFK-CLE. I needed to get to NYC early to catch an international flight leaving from EWR (due to airline changing airports) and this was my only option at the time. I checked the seating chart and also called customer service to see what the flight load was and the rep said the plane was pretty full and for $50.00 I could do a same day confirmed standby so I did. I arrived at CLE gate to find only 7 passengers on the flight. What a rip-off! The FA was nice BOB for snacks. Return flight was much better flight was passengers PAX total . FA was great and very personable. Many carry-ons were gate checked and were received shortly after landing.

### American Eagle customer review
Commuting from the midwest to Boston every week I have taken dozens of flights with American Eagle typically on a Embraer regional jet with the 1x2 seat layout. Presuming pricing is equal they are my preferred airline due to the Embraer aircraft. That said - pricing is all over the board. I may pay $200 one week and the next week the same flight is $400. I have preferred status so I always have access to the exit row (9 or 11) which are the only reasonably comfortable seats on the plane (1a is also ok if you have no Carry-On). Attendants are pleasant and attentive. Complimentary beverages are served but no snacks. Because the plane is small boarding and deplaning is quite fast. American Eagle allows gate checking of carry-ons which is necessary if you are taking anything more than about 9" in depth. I have actually bought a rolling computer bag specifically because it is the size and shape of the Embraer overhead compartment. Don't expect a standard roller bag to fit - they don't even get close. Biggest complaint is overhead light maintenance - at least 1 of 5 flights the overhead light is burned out. 2nd biggest complaint is temperature. The front of the plane is hot and the rear is cold. The exit row gives extra legroom but it also is a cold seat in winter. Keep you coat handy. Overall it is a reasonable flying experience if you can keep from changing planes in LaGuardia.

Toronto to La Guardia. Very helpful at check in and gate. Small old aircraft but nice flight attendant on board and served a drink on the short flight. Age of airplane was my only concern.

### American Eagle customer review
Key West - MIA. Easy check in thereafter clueless/lacking service and rude staff. Plane late without any particular reason given. Succeeded to get places to the next flight which departed earlier only after insisting on various (non-responding uninterested) persons (we were about to miss the following transatlantic flight). Service onboard unfriendly.

### American Eagle customer review
MIA-NAS and return with ATR72. Two nice short flights. But both legs were late - due to a technical problem and due to mismanagement of the ground staff - there was no one to unload the aircraft in Miami. American Eagle gates in MIA are very run-down.

Arrived at airport at 6 am this morning to find my flight cancelled due to fog (that's right low clouds). I am still sitting here at 11:10 am while listening to every other airline depart and arrive at this airport while American Eagle struggles to get their act together. I am looking at the departure board and every airline is on time except American Eagle. Travel at your own risk.

### American Eagle customer review
I was stuck in the same situation around the same time as the previous commenter. I waited in DFW airport for almost 3 days waiting for a flight out due to fog which was a legitimate problem. However my biggest complaint was the seeming nonchalance about the situation. After being put on standby after my initial flight was cancelled and watching the next 4 flights cancel as well I was informed that no more flights were going out that day (it was 7pm) and no more would be scheduled. Granted I don't know the specifics that need to take place to schedule/staff flights but I don't feel like AE/AA did anywhere near what they could have to remedy the situation. On another trip I arrived to the small regional airport I fly out of 40 minutes before my flight (I know they say an hour but its such a tiny place there is never an issue). I went to the check in desk and found that there were no AE/AA employees there. Anywhere. I asked the agent from another line what was going on and was told "AE runs with only barebones staff and he went on break. I waited 15 minutes until the agent arrived and was told "Oh ma'am you missed your flight. I then spent the rest of the day on standby trying to catch one of only a few flights out. I made it thank goodness but the nonchalance and general organization of AE definitely made for a less than pleasant trip.

DAL to LIT. Recently flew Am Eagle from Dallas to Little Rock. When I got on the plane the senior citizen next to me asked the stewardess where the restroom was located. The stewardess rudely stated that "they announced at the gate that the restroom is broken and you should go before you get on the plane. When we informed her that neither of us heard the annoucement she just stared. Then she said "well it is just a short flight so it is okay-only 53 minutes. I tried to explain that for us senior citizens that it is not okay and she just walked away. I mean come on. Can't they even maintain the restrooms? And to make matters worse I complained to American Airlines and have yet to get a response. Poor maintenance issues late flights and rude agents in the past made me start to doubt the airline and this is just the frosting on the cake!

### American Eagle customer review
We were on the fourth flight scheduled from San Juan to Tortola BVI. The first three were cancelled due to mechanical problems with the plane. The fourth flight finally left 2 hours late. American Eagle does not have enough mechanics or spare parts to keep their planes in the air in a reliable way. In the future I will fly to St. Thomas and take the ferry to Tortola to avoid American Eagle.

YYZ-HEL-YYZ. I had booked a return trip from Toronto to Helsinki via JFK. The New York - Helsinki leg was on Finnair and the service on those flights was great but the Toronto - New York connection was sold to me as Finnair codeshare on American Eagle. Quite soon after I had arrived at Toronto checked in and gone through security it was announced that the American Eagle flight to JFK will be delayed by an hour because of "bad weather" at JFK. For me the delay meant missing my Finnair flight from JFK to HEL and so as soon as I heard about the delay I tried to track down the American Eagle/American Airlines staff in Toronto to see what can be done to help me make it on the Finnair flight. However the AE/AA staff was nowhere to be found. When I finally got to talk with them I talked with several people whose advice was basically just this: "Well there is another Finnair flight from JFK to HEL the next day you just catch that one instead. When I finally made it to JFK an hour and 10 minutes late the Finnair flight was leaving in 2 minutes. We were at gate 34 and Finnair at gate 4. I ran all the way and made it. Obviously my bag didn't. I would've liked to see AE/AA help me somehow along the way but nothing was offered. Glad I made it though and I got my bag the next day.

YYZ-ORD-YYZ. Booked flights on American Eagle online then realised that they use rather small aircraft and regretted it! However our return flight from Toronto to Chicago was pretty good. Check in and bag drop was fast efficient and the AA staff on duty were courteous and friendly. Admiral's Club lounge was ok at both ends - complimentary glass of wine in ORD. Both flights on time and the advantage of these smaller Embraer 145s is that they can be filled and unloaded quickly. Efficient FA each way if not over friendly and complimentary soft drinks served. Seat belt sign on for duration of flights each way a few bumps here and there. Seats were comfortable enough for a one hour flight and leg room was ok (neither my partner or I are particularly small people). Landed early at Toronto and sat on runway for a few minutes waiting for gate to become available. But all in all a pretty good experience for the fare.

### American Eagle customer review
ORD-BUF - a short hop on American Eagle and a very decent experience. Check in was fast and efficient and I was told I would be better off checking in my one bag on the airbridge which was very helpful. Boarding on time and I settled into 1A. It was nice to have some extra legroom at the front and not a problem being opposite the tiny galley - the crew member relieved me of my carry-on as no underseat storage and was prompt in asking if I needed it after take -off and also in returning it at the end. Flight left on time - plane was clean and we arrived ahead of schedule. Bags were quickly returned to the airbridge on deplaning. Overall short but very sweet experience.

### American Eagle customer review
St. Louis to Nashville return. Both flights left and arrived exactly on time. Both planes were clean and orderly. Even though both were "regional jets" I had a exit row on the way out and row #1 on the way back which meant plenty of leg room both ways. The in-flight service was fine considering both were 1 hour flights.

### American Eagle customer review
Toronto to Louisville return via Chicago - Plane was 45 minutes late at departure which meant that I had to run to make my Chicago connection (they literally closed the door after me). We flew on Embraers on each flight - interiors in pretty poor shape and quite dirty with in-flight magazines looking as if they had been used to clean the floors. The seats were incredibly narrow and all planes were full. Service was very friendly though with the hostesses apologetic for the hideous quality of the snacks. Free soft drinks departing from Louisville but not from Toronto. I flew on an award ticket but I'm not sure I would pay full price for such a trip.
