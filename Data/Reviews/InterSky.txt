Flew SZG-ZUR. Wasn't expecting anything from an hour long flight in a small twin-prop plane but this was an excellent flight. Smooth takeoffs and landing. Easy check-in and great assistance at the airport. Flight left on time with no delays. Crew is very courteous (and they speak very good English). When you think it can't get any better they served food! Complimentary food is a rare thing on short domestic flights especially on twin-prop planes. Overall excellent airline and would recommend them.

Rode Intersky from Salzburg-Zurich. As it was a short flight I wasn't expecting much. I expected wrong. Usually airlines with a fleet this small or flights this short wouldn't have as a excellent service as this airline. Outstanding selection of drinks and more than two selections of free snacks. The flight attendants were kind and the take-off and landing were smooth as if the plane were a jet and not a prop. Would definitely fly them again.

I am flying FDH-DUS regularly and I am fully satisfied with this airline. Due to the smaller sizes of their aircraft's the flight takes some time (about 1hr 15 min) but service onboard is excellent. Good regional snacks and plenty of drinks are served during the flight. Ground handling in FDH is very quick and efficient. Prices are high but still recommendable!

### InterSky customer review
Intersky is another airline charging high prices for regional services using and chartering cheap airlines. Just flew back from SZG to ZRH. Friendly stewardess and good service - captain did not say a word. Even though Intersky is the only direct Service between SZG and ZRH - I would rather fly LH via Frankfurt.

### InterSky customer review
Because LH flights from FDH-CGN are now to FRA only - and at inconvenient times followed by connections to CGN by train I elected to fly InterSky instead. Very clean aircraft and professional service throughout. But for an 'Economy' one way ticket price of â‚¬350.28 they could surely provide at least a free cup of coffee? Poor value - everything else fine.

FDH-THF. Friendly staff clean aircraft with comfortable leather seats. Orders for drinks and snacks taken and served individualy. Prices on their inflight menu are OK. Landing in Berlin's Tempelhof airport is a fantastic experience. Too bad the airport is due to be closed soon. Even with bags to claim aircraft to subway station took less than 10 Minutes. Beat that!

### InterSky customer review
Friedrichshafen - Hamburg. It was one of my best experiences on a regional flight/airline. Aircraft was clean. The crew (Check-In to cabin crew) was very polite as well as highly professional. Flight attendant made clearly understandable announcements/safety demos. The only downside is that Intersky asks passengers to pay prohibitive expensive prices for onboard drinks/snacks. But since they consider themselves as a low cost airline (truly providing LCC price level) it was no surprise. and everybody is free not to buy anything.
