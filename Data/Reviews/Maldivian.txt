### "a tad disappointing"
Not Verified |  The check-in staff was very helpful and I had a smooth check-in process. I received an aisle seat in the exit row with loads of legroom. However that is where the good part ends, the aircraft was not very clean and the inflight service consists of a juice, nuts and the thinnest bar of Cadbury Diary Milk chocolate you will ever see. They did not seem to have any menu for purchase as well. After spending 2 hours in the Domestic Terminal at Male where nothing is available to purchase and then going through a 2 hour flight with nothing to eat is not the best experience. There is a single attendant on the flight who passes by once to hand out the food and once to take the trash. The experience is certainly not comparable to domestic flights in Asia and a tad disappointing especially given the premium prices in Maldives. The good thing is that the flight was absolutely on time.

### "on-board experience is a let down"
Not Verified |  Check-in was efficient and the staff is helpful and the flight is on time. The seats have good leg room and compared to the previous flight was cleaner. However the on-board experience is a let down. I had taken a 5 am flight which was the only way to make it in time for my onward flight to India. The hopping flight is 2 hours long and after waking up super early to make the flight, one would expect at least a sandwich or something for breakfast. Unfortunately all they offered was the usual choice of a juice or water, a small packet of nuts and a thin bar of Cadbury dairy milk chocolate. After having flown with them earlier, I was prepared for a sub-par experience and had carried some snacks. Keep in mind that the Fuvahmulah airport is essentially just one room with no shops. so if you are taking this flight, plan to carry food etc.

### Maldivian customer review
Not Verified |  Older Dash 8 but comfortable and good leg room ( but very noisy) Departed on time , friendly sole flight attendant , juice and water on offer and great views of the Atolls , they were organised , friendly and have pride in their brand and country , can't ask for more than that. A bit pricey but no competition I guess

### "delayed flight for almost 2 hours"
Male to Dharavandhoo. They delayed our flight for almost 2 hours for no apparent reason. 3 other charter planes of similar time and same destination left just fine. Not only did we find out the delay very close to departure time but also the single departure terminal was almost EMPTY at some point, so there's almost no excuse in not being able to provide the flight sooner, since there were no other flights going on for a good 30-60 minutes.

### "Maldivian has a long way to go"
Male to Kooddoo. I was travelling by Maldivian in 2 sectors on the same day. But the airline does not provide a fly-through service. The staff at check in counter was able to give the seat I requested for. The flight was delayed but there was no announcement or indication by airline on the delays. Three other Maldivian flights were also delayed that were scheduled to depart almost the same time as my flight. They made an announcement for 2 of the flights and gave an estimated departure time for the other. Ground staff are relatively inexperienced and naive with no sense of accountability in attending to customer. The aircraft was clean and well maintained but extremely hot. The cabin crew gave a wet tissue. Seats were very packed with limited leg space. There was no inflight entertainment or catering. The cabin crew announced the restriction of any electronics or mobile phones and clearly mentioned that "the mobile phones must be swtiched off through out the flight". There was an inflight journal which I have read in my previous flights. For more than 1 hour I just sat up and did nothing, just waited for the aircraft to land. Seats were fixed upright and cannotbe reclined. Cabin crew served packet juice and water. No food, light meals or snacks such as sandwich, peanuts available even for purchase in the flight. Overhead speaker was not clear at all and didn't understand most of the announcements. The flight was very noisy and they offered ear plugs. Maldivian has a long way to go in meeting it's customer needs. Lack of competition is the the upside and downfall of this airline.

### "flight attendants were helpful"
Maldivian from Male to Kaadedhdhoo return. To reach my resort I needed to take domestic flight from main airport to local one. Before the flight I was escorted to the lounge to relax. The flight was delayed due to rain and traffic at airport. The domestic terminal was small and crowded. The aircraft parked at remote bay so we needed to walk for boarding. The aircraft was new and clean. The seat comfort was okay for small aircraft, I was put in the front row. The flight attendants were helpful. They served newspaper but only in Dhivehi. After take off, the flight attendants offered juices and water. The flight took 1 hour I really enjoyed the view of atoll through my window seat. The take off and landing were so smooth. The return flight was not much different, only huge delay.
