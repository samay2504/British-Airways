### "Check-in was efficient"
There are two options for getting from Dar es Salaam to Zanzibar – a two-hour ferry journey or a 20 minute flight. The main airlines flying this route are Auric Air and Air Tanzania. Ordering the ticket via Opodo was easy and the airline operates from Terminal 1 – a small building about 1km from the main terminals. Check-in was efficient and the waiting room had several powerful air conditioning units. You could even buy food and drink. Tickets were checked and we were walked across to the Cessna. It had three seats in each row and although tight it was not uncomfortable. It only had a pilot and we flew at about 3000 feet giving us a clear view of the sea and then the island. It ended with a very smooth landing close to the terminal.
