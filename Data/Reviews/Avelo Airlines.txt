### "very happy with airline"
Second time flying Avelo (last time New Haven CT to Destin FL) seats small and get uncomfortable but very happy with airline. Staff is polite and rates are reasonable. I like the direct flights into smaller airports. Customer service number needs more staff though if issue,arises always over 100 people in front of you.

### “unprofessional, unhelpful and disrespectful”
Not Verified | The stewardesses were very unprofessional, unhelpful and very disrespectful. I would never again fly with this airline again due to this fact. The stewardess flying out of Ft Lauderdale  definitely need retraining.

### "we can no longer board the flight"
Arriving at the Avelo check-in counter in New Haven 1.5 hours before our departure, we had to wait in line for over an hour, the line was not moving. A staff member asked who was taking flight 717 to Orlando, we made it clear that it was our flight. She then signaled us to wait but nothing happened, the line did not move forward. 20 minutes before our flight, we finally arrive at the check-in desk, the girl at the counter tells us that we can no longer board the flight, it is too late because we have a checked suitcase (already paid for). We are frustrated (with good reason).. The supposed team leader asks us to stand close to the wall, she will come see us after her customer. Final boarding of flight 717, we are still waiting for the team leader who, ultimately, decided to answer the entire waiting line before us. The children are crying because they want to go on vacation. She came back just to tell us to calm down, because if we continued to be angry, she was going to call the police. We had to buy new tickets with Breeze which had a counter next to that of Avelo and which had a flight 2 hours later. We have currently been waiting on the phone for 1.5 hours to speak to customer service and no possible refund for the moment.

### "My bag was missing items"
On December 27th I checked my bag on a flight from Palm Springs to Santa Rosa, CA. I got stuck in a long TSA line and missed my flight. (my fault). I went to the Santa Rosa airport after booking a flight on another airline. When I went there to retrieve my bag, I was told it wasn’t there. I filed a lost bag claim with Avelo, and, after about 8 days was told it was lost. Since I missed the plane I didn’t qualify for any compensation. On February 27th I received an e-mail that SR airport had my bag. I immediately went to the airport. My bag was missing items.

### "Just the worst service
Terrible. Just the worst service I've ever experienced with all the charges and hidden charges. Just absolutely horrible and I would love for anyone to save your money and go with a normal flight other than this

### “Service is mediocre”
Not Verified | If you have baggage pick any other airline, this company doesn’t open check in until 2 hours ahead of flight but won’t let baggage on after 30 minutes, which if it takes 40 minutes to get thru line leaves you without your bag. Service is mediocre and by the time you pay 120 for your bag round trip and 20-70 for a seat next to your travel partner make the flight cost the same as Delta or another NON-discount airline. No amenities onboard: no water, WiFi, hard seats making a 2 hour flight uncomfortable, I flew twice, once without bags and was disappointed and once with checked bag and will never fly Avello again.

### "they couldn't do anything for us"
My family and I took a trip to Las Vegas from our local airport and we were scheduled to come back on 11-11 after being in Vegas for 36 hours. We were informed at 1pm our flight was delayed 24 hours and was told they would cover the hotel cost for another night. This wasn't the best option, and I had a very important meeting for work to attend but it would be way cheaper then booking another flight on another airline. We went to the airport 3 hours early because we didn't have anything else to do and when it was time to board we went to the departing gate. When we arrived the airline at that gate wasn't the correct one and we were told to go down to another one. When we got there, there was no one at the counter but I was able to flag down a crew member in the boarding area. They told us the flight was canceled and they couldn't do anything for us, the plane was still parked and ended up leaving while I was on hold with customer service. They refunded my flight cost and I ended up booking with another airline at twice the price and had to fly back to an airport 1 hour away. I now come to find out they will not reimburse me for the hotel because I canceled my flight after it being delayed and told it was canceled the second time. I'm out so much money from this.

### "I feel cheated and deceived"
Very uncomfortable. Seats are too close together we were unable to put the tray down. Seats were broken, would not recline. Return flight was canceled stranding 4 of us in Las Vegas. The staff at the gate said meals, transportation and lodging would be reimbursed to submit receipts. We found dinner under $35/person and used our points for the rooms doubled up on our “non-taxi” to help defray the costs. It was still just over $500 for the 4 of us not including lost wages. We submitted our receipts and now Avelo is saying they will only reimburse “Up to” $150 for lodging. Nothing for our meals or transportation to from the hotel! We won’t even recoup the $150 because we used our points and only had to pay taxes and resort fees. At this time I feel cheated and deceived by the airline. They either need to fully educate their staff to their policies or honor what their staff tell their passengers. As a customer my trust has been irreparably breached and I will never use them again nor will I recommend them to anyone ever!

### "I do not recommend Avelo"
My SO and I had booked a round trip with Avelo from Wilmington DE to San Juan PR July 20 -July 24 2024. With departure from San Juan on 07/24 at 2:05pm. The flight down was as smooth as one could expect from a low cost airline. The return was an entirely different story - after repeated delays regarding a maintenance issue, we were told a plane would be arriving by 6pm from Florida to take us back. We saw the crew leave and the plane towed and no replacement flight. Text message received at 6:59pm from Avelo to all passengers stating "Unfortunately, we will not be able to re-crew your flight...flight has been delayed until tomorrow 07/25/2024 at 6:30 AM. The desk agent was nowhere to be found to provide additional details. We had been offered a $15 meal credit per person earlier - nearly impossible to find anything at the airport for $15, Then another text stating "Please submit receipts for any reasonable expenses to [email protected]. Avelo will reimburse you for up to $150 per reservation for a hotel tonight. I quickly found the cheapest hotel in proximity to the airport for just over $300. Everyone on the flight of almost 200 passengers were scrambling to find hotel rooms. The next morning the flight took off - never an apology for the delay. The flight staff never circulated in the cabin and never offered a drop of water or signature bag of plantain chips - nothing. One passenger told us he had gone to the galley to get water and the crew was sleeping. Once home, I dutifully submitted my reasonable expenses for hotel, uber rides and meal for my SO and myself. I was reimbursed less than 1/2 of out of pocket cost for the delay. Customer service, upon inquiry, informed me that hotel was only authorized for up to $150 per reservation. I penned a letter to the CEO, Andrew Levy, to voice my complaint and request reimbursement for all expenses. No response. So, I do not recommend Avelo, not only did they jerk us around all afternoon we expected to fly, they inconvenienced everyone with the incredibly delayed flight and refused to fully reimburse for passenger expenses as a result of their issue.

### "worst airline ever"
Not Verified |   My flight was canceled on the day I was supposed to travel, they gave us a number to contact customer service to cancel, reschedule or obtain a refund. When I contacted them, the only option they offered me was to refund the money for the outward and onward trip will came to credit it for a next trip within a year, well, they returned the correct amount of the lost flight, but they incorrectly credited me the remaining money, I paid $408.00 in total, they refunded me $197.00, the remaining balance is $211.00 and they only credited me $128.00. What's the trick, they are going to charge me a fee for a problem with the airline that decided to cancel my flight, I hope this is just a mistake and they will credit me with the remaining money. Again they destroyed my vacation plan, (car reservation, hotel room, restaurant reservation in advance with 50% at front, rides paid in full ) they offered to reschedule the next day at 2:00 pm basically arriving around 5:30 , loosing 2 entire days of my vacation and a lot of money in reservations made in advance) worst airline ever.

### "never heard of a refund expiring"
Booked Avelo Airlines for a trip to Orlando last year. Due to unforeseen circumstances we were forced to cancel our vacation. When I requested a refund they refused to refund the amount back to my credit card, instead issued me Travel Funds. 13 months later I was booking a flight for a vacation and intended to use those Travel Funds only to learn that they expired after 1 year. Literally tried using them 1 year and 1 month and they refuse to let me use the money I paid them for a flight. Avelo basically stole almost $900 from me. I've never heard of a refund expiring. And everyone we spoke to at Avelo was extremely unhelpful and rude.

### "refusing to honor this claim"
Avelo does not honor baggage damage claims! When we arrived in Tampa, we noticed that our luggage had been damaged with a major dent and hole. Within an hour we filed an online claim. We waited a whole week to get a response and did not hear anything until August 2 the day after we returned home. The email stated that since we did not respond to their last two emails they were closing our claim. I responded to them that this was the first email I had received from them and that I check my emails hourly. Melissa, their representative, stated that 2 emails were sent one on 7/26 & one on 7/30. I told her that I checked through all my emails junk, sent, and trash and there were no emails from Avelo except for the one that we received on August 2. They are refusing to honor this claim.

### "Avelo made it worse in every way"
What was a an already stressful time Avelo made it worse in every way. I arrived in New Haven Tweed on Friday, July 19, 2023. I was set to return Sunday, July 21, 2023. I arrived to the airport at 10:30 am (confirmation #YWL6PP). I didn't have any bags besides a carry on and car seat for my 1 yr old traveling with me. The Avelo Staff moves very slow and are very unhelpful. Went through the TSA pre check then off with my shoes and bag threw the scanner. At that moment the computer or scanner went down. No one apologized and no even explained what was happening. No type of urgency or care in the world. Everyone walking around unsure of their job description. Which held up me for a good while. Well, to my dismay the flight took off without! And I wasn't the only one at least 6 people were in my position. Feeling very upset and discouraged. I call customer to see if they could help me with getting the next flight. I apologize I didn't get a name. Yet, this woman was very rude and mean. She made me feel even worst on what turned out to be a bad day. No help at all. Telling me I was a no show so there is nothing she could do and this is literally right after I missed the flight. And she practically told me it was my fault be there 2hrs ahead. Then hanging up. So I went back to a family members home. Had to make my next move the best move. So after I searched for another flight leaving that night and I had no luck. Then purchased a ticket for Monday. Arrived very early so I wouldn't miss another flight. Once more made I asked about the car seat I was instructed to Gate Check it. There was nothing placed on the car seat but a purple tag with my last name and flight number. So I make it through TSA precheck. Place bag on scanner belt. At this point I'm being advised that I would be searched cause powder was found in my daughters car seat. Yet, couldn't be sure what the substance. Now, I'm being searched in front of everyone as if I'm a criminal. Then I get my stuff proceed to Gate 2. I was then advised leave my car seat at the bottom of the ramp. I gave it to a Airport Employee. I boarded my flight. I arrive in Atlanta as I exit the plane I see a man with another flyers stroller at that I asked about my car seat I was told pick it up at baggage claim. Walk all the way to baggage claim and my car seat never comes. Then walk over to over sized looking for my car seat and nothing. I walk to the Avelo counter and no one is there to aid me in the loss of my car seat. At this point I feel broken and really disappointed with Avelo in a whole. I really don't ever want to fly with you again. So I call customer and I am advised on what to do. I am woman flying with a 1 yr old child. Things could've been made easier or a little smoother in assisting me. It was my first time using this Airline and It will be my last!

### “price amazing and service was great”
I could not have been happier with this airline !It is a no-frills flight. You can ask for a bottle of water if you want. The plane was on time clean fully staffed with pleasant people. On our way to New Haven our flight landed 20 minutes early and on our flight back to St. Louis our plane landed 30 minutes early. The seats were comfortable and honestly, I didn’t miss the free soda or cookies that you can get on more expensive flights. I don’t understand why people are giving this airline bad reviews. We were three adults and two kids Who were flying for the first time and the flight attendants could not have been nicer to them! I will definitely use this airline whenever possible the price is amazing and the service was great!

### "Horrible experience"
Not Verified |   Horrible experience, delayed departure leaving, delayed departure returning multiple times, we were sent back and forth in the Orlando airport because the gates changed so much, arrival time was 3 hours later then booked, delaying and inconveniencing the passengers. I wrote an email to customer service about multiple grievances, all went ignored and unanswered. It’s unprofessional. Doubt I’ll ever use this airline again if they cannot operate or answer their concerned customers. Avelo should respond to customer emails

### "absolute worst airline"
Not Verified |   This was the absolute worst flying experience I have ever encountered. There was not a terminal selected until 15 minutes before the doors closed, so due to this unprofessionalism I was strapped for time once I figured out where to go. The gate was prompted on the monitor at 12:40 and the doors closed at 12:55 for the 15 minutes before take off at 1:10. As I arrived the door was still open and they shut it while watching me approaching and waving. There was also another customer there that supposedly arrived "one minute before me" that they decided to reopen the door for her and allow her in while I was standing there. The staff were just about as rude as any flight staff I have ever dealt with. Then, to get a refund, I was on wait for one hour and 23 minutes to get an Avelo credit, who would want that, instead of a refund on my credit card. This is the absolute worst airline ever! I'm very disappointed that the Greenville, SC airport has made such a bad decision bringing this airport to its community. Not worth the savings!

### "never fly with them again"
Not Verified |   We traveled Avelo Air and we noticed that they let everyone take their carry-on luggage with them from RDU to ROC. However, when we were bringing the same carry-on bag. We got stopped at the gate and were asked to pay $65 as the carry-on bag had the wheels which doesn't fit their limit. We were forced to pay and that is the rip-off as the same carry-on bag was allowed. We will never fly with them again. Oh, btw they don't even offer cup of water in the plane.

### "staff is very rude and unhelpful"
First of all that Airport is entirely too small to load all of its passengers going to a major city airport. My luggage was sent to the wrong airport because while the plane was boarding I was still going thru security and missed my flight my went to another airport and because I missed my flight and they won't be held responsible for sending it to me. Not only will they not send it, but at this moment the luggage can't be found. I don't know which airport it's at nor do they. They have no reps at any airport that would be available to help me in a baggage claim department. I've corresponded several times via email and it has taken at least 72 hrs each time I reached out to get an answer regarding this situation. I have medicine in my luggage that is needed and I can't even speak to a live person. The staff is very rude and unhelpful. I am one of many who missed their flights on that day and had to pay out of pocket to catch another flight going a farther distance. For your own sake think twice before flying Avelo. Experience will not let me do it again.

### “upset Avelo is ending their contract”
Not Verified | I would like to say, I’m very upset that Avelo is ending their contract with greater Binghamton airport. It’s the only airport I can fly out of to go see my grand baby. By Avelo ending their contract you are forcing me to fly with Delta which I will never afford. I don’t have access to the airports anywhere else upstate ny. Please don’t end your contract. By ending your contract you’re forcing me to use up all my travel funds immediately or I’m out of $465. Apparently there will be no more flights after august 18 th of this year, so what happens to my travel funds?

### "Zero service"
The only thing it has going for it is Wilmington DE airport. I hate flying into PHL or Baltimore. Was able to fly direct from Orlando. They sent out an email telling everyone to arrive 3 hours early because security was a nightmare. There were at least 30 of us standing there waiting for Avelo to open. I’m TSA precheck. I was the only person in line and was through in 2 minutes. Then the flight delayed. It was originally a 3:20 flight but took off finally at 5:50. Can’t really fault them - delays happen. But the plane was so hot. We were on it for at least a half hour before it took off. It was horrid. Flight attendants busy talking with buddies whole flight. Zero service. Rude in fact. They loaded a bunch of bottled water. I hoped we would get water after heat. They never even passed through cabin. Went to use bathroom- flight attendant who never left the front of cabin was snarky. The one and only time an attendant came through cabin during flight was to collect trash before we landed. I have to go back home- thinking at least it’ll start at Wilmington and be less bizarre than Orlando. Hopefully they won’t try to bake us on the plane. PS I think they teach all their employees not to smile.

### "worst experience I have had"
Do not fly Avelo it is not worth the hassle! My baggage was left in Wilmington Nc on Friday 6/28. I was informed they’d be on the flight arriving today Monday no one called emailed or even text to say they had arrived. I show up to Ft. Lauderdale airport once I find out the flight had landed only to find everyone had already clocked out 30 minutes prior. I call customer service who then lets me know there is not one thing they can do to assist me with retrieving my property other than advising me to return to the airport the next day when Avelo employees are there .. at what time I don’t know! Also there is no reason call customer service as all they can and will do is redirect you to their site where all communication is held through email! This is the worst experience I have had dealing with any airline, tomorrow will be the fifth day I am without my luggage and paying out of pocket for items I already own

### "not be flying Avelo again"
Not Verified |   The check in personnel were rude and unprofessional. There was a line 10 people deep and these other people tried to push there way ahead of everyone. They were taken ahead of us all and when we complained we were threatened with being made to go to the back of the line. We were very nice about it, but was treated very badly. I am disabled and can’t stand for long periods of time - that’s why we complained. Needless to say we will not be flying Avelo again.

### “Incompetence personified”
Not Verified | June 29,2024. I am the sister of the passenger, Eulogio Galvez, who was scheduled to fly from Tweed New Have Airport, (HVN,) to Orlando International Airport, (MCO) on June 21, 2024. Directly before boarding, my brother fell in Tweed's airport and was unable to restand. He was taken, by ambulance, to St. Raphael's Hospital, New Haven, CT and it was determined he had broken his left hip. I called customer service, to get my brother's suitcase off the flight but the flight had already departed. I continued to call customer service, daily and was given several different ways of having the suitcase sent back to Tweed airport. However, not until days later was I told that I needed to fill out a baggage claim, online. I did so and on Wednesday, June 26, I finally received an email from baggage claim that my brother's suitcase would "BE ON THE NEXT FLIGHT” from Orlando's MCO and I would be notified when my brother's bag was ready for pick-up. I wrote for 2 more days, saying that I had not gotten any emails that the bag was back at Tweed. Finally, on today, (Saturday, 6/29/2024,) I drove all the way to Tweed, to see if the suitcase had gotten there. IT HAD NOT! I then, received an email, hours later, that my request could not be honored because the flight was on JUNE 8! I wrote back to them reiterating the flight was #721 and was on JUNE 21st! I have not heard anything, since. Incompetence personified and total disregard for a passenger, who remains hospitalized, with no clothes!

### "do not count on this airline"
If you are on any sort of schedule, either tight or lax, do not count on this airline, especially out of Burbank Airport. The flight was delayed 3 hours, with the plane on the tarmac the entire time, with no updates or information. This was also the case for two other Avelo flights. It's seriously not worth sitting around, waiting and waiting with no information, and stressing over all the plans missed due to this shoddy airline.

### "the worst airline ever"
This has to be the worst airline ever. The tix are cheap but be prepared to pay for your luggage even the carryon. Tight seats, no WiFi, warm ac! My flight was delayed to my destination for 3.5 hours due to weather so we had to stop in west palm beach. That’s not the issue though the issue was they were so rude from the time i checked my luggage in and don’t let me talk about the rudeness of the flight attendants who gave us a small bottle of warm water the whole flight. The whole plane was complaining on how rude they were. I only gave it a 1 star rating because it wont let me put 0!

### "I am extremely disappointed"
I am writing this review after my first experience flying with Avelo Airlines. I must say, I am extremely disappointed with this airline. The flight was delayed and I felt scammed. When I booked my ticket, it clearly stated that a hand carry luggage was included. However, upon boarding, I was asked to pay extra because it was not actually included. What a scam! Never again! Not deserve a 1 star!

### “have gotten the run around on the phone”
My husband, my mom and 6 month old baby were traveling to Destin, FL for a wedding Thursday morning and were excited to see that Avelo had a direct flight. We checked in with plenty of time and went right to the small gate where it was packed with people. I went up to the check in counter to make sure it wasn’t our flight (the signage was very confusing) and the employee said no, Destin was in 45 minutes they were now boarding Wilmington NC. My mom sat down with the baby and my husband and I went to get coffees. We heard a man (or lack there of) Felipe Cordero, yelling “last call for Destin, 1 minute” (their PA system was broken come to find out). We raced over to the gate (25 yards away) to see my mom with our baby pleading with the crew to open the door that they just slammed in front of her face. Confused, we asked what was happening and Felipe said it was “too late” the gate was closed. There were 100 passengers standing outside the door that he refused to open, on the tarmac to the plane. He could have easily opened the door and let us on but he refused even though he saw us walking (1 SECOND after he said 1 MINUTE before the flight was closed) over to the entrance before slamming the door shut. There were also no other flights to Destin until Saturday. Our luggage, car seat and stroller were all on the plane. I pleaded with him to at least get our car seat before the plane took off so we could get home. He absolutely refused and told us to go buy another. We asked to see his badge but he flipped it over and said no. I was so shaken and upset, I asked the New Haven Police Officer there to assist (who could not have been any nicer). The police officer got his name for us, and stayed with us the whole time and tried to help with suggestions how to get to our destination. Before leaving, he gave us his cell to call directly if we needed anything. We had to rebook to Orlando, rent a car and drive 6 hours to Destin after waiting another 3 hours in Avelos terminal for the next flight. Waiting for the next flight, it happened to 3 other people running to the gate who missed their flight to their destination bc of the broken PA system and misleading signage all saying the same thing “there was no announcement!”. Should we have double checked that our plane wasn’t boarding even though I had already asked if the line was going to our destination? Maybe. But the way Felipe and his crew treated us with a BABY (and a crying mom!) was completely unacceptable and just mean. We wrote the CEO of Avelo and have gotten the run around on the phone but hoping for a response to let them know how mismanaged and horrible their New Haven airport is. HPN, LGA and JFK are worth the extra money and distance over the close proximity of Avelo’s poor excuse of an airport.

### “my new go to airline“
Not Verified | 1st time flying with this airline, usually use Delta or American Airlines. This is my new go to airlines. left VPS on 6/13. fastest boarding ever, stewards & stewardesses were great, personable. Flight arrived 10 min. early, left New Haven 6/14. Boarding again fast efficient, staff great. We arrived home 20 minutes earlier than expected (both flights early? unheard of). Passengers actually broke out in applause on landing, one stated "it was like landing in butter" didn't even feel the landing. Great job to this company, keep it up. I'll be back soon.

### "charged 65.00 for overhead luggage"
Not Verified |   Avelo prices are good. However, I was charged 65.00 for overhead luggage going and returning. Totalling 130.00 the almost amount of my total flight Totalling 136.00. I made calls to Avelo since this was my 1st flight with them. The reason for lower prices because they Double Charge for Overhead Luggage. My luggage could fit under the seat.

### "refused to board the animal"
We boarded a flight with a department of transportation approved (DOT-papered) service animal who's flown on every other airline. After checking in and providing all paperwork, and going through every check at the airport including at the gate, the flight stewardess refused to board the animal, after our family had been seated. DOT paperwork was provided upon airport check-in. Our entire family was removed from the flight, our checked bags were lost in BUR, and despite daily calls, Avelo supervisors will not return calls and their service say any refund requests were denied. We have received no credit or refund for checked bag fees (2), both flights for four people, or paid dog fee. We've now incurred no-show fees, lost all of our medications and valuables and to make matters worse, we were traveling due to major illness in the family. So a cheap, direct fare will gets you nothing if anything goes wrong. Do not fly, ever.

### "they closed my case"
I booked, price went down so I rebooked. They didn't give me a refund. They put the money in escrow. I didn't know that so after 5 calls I got a refund but they need to rebook the flight. Upon receiving the conformation I noticed they got the date wrong. Another call. Then I noticed they didn't put on my check bags. Another call where they told me I have 2 checked bags but they needed to put the funds in seats? I said okay you must know what your doing. I was reassured. Got to the airport with my 86 year old mother, sir you need to pay $130 for the 2 checked bags. Long story longer and not wanting to hold up the line I agreed figuring I'll clear it up when I get home. 3 emails and 3 phone calls, no luck. I contacted the executive office and someone said they would resolve this. 5 emails and they closed my case. I sent all the proof. So a $237 flight cost me $397. Stay away I predict they will be gone in two years.

### “does not honor their refund policy”
I never flew on Avelo. When we arrived at the airport in Burbank, the man agent for Avelo at the counter informed us we arrived too late for our luggage to be put on the plane. He went on to say that we could go to get the plane at the gate w/o our luggage; however he could not say that we would be able to get on the plane either! At that point, we decided the flight to Vegas would not be happening & we were informed that this flight was the only one they had all day. Later when I contacted Avelo by email requesting my refund, they repeatedly told me - That we were marked as No Shows - and therefore we were no eligible for any refunds. They to this day maintain that is/was the case. Clearly we were Cancels and NOT No Shows. I said ask your counterperson...he clearly not only saw us, but spoke to us multiple times. So BE AWARE - This airline does Not HONOR Their Refund Policy.

### "Re carry-on baggage, beware"
Not Verified |   Unfortunately they were unable to provide the aisle chair to assist my husband off the plane at RDU. He had to walk unsafely to a wheelchair at the entrance to the plane. Not a good situation for a handicapped person trying to travel. Avelo monitors the same carry on multiple times for size including check in and at gate. They had multiple people at the gate who checked us more than once even though we already paid the extra fee for being .5 too tall. it's the handle" They measure carryon and charge $65 if 1/2 inch too tall including handle or wheels. You have to keep proving you have paid. It feels predatory unfortunately. There's got to be a better way. The carryon fit very nicely under the seat in front of me without any question. I must say at check-in the agent Polly who charged us the carryon fee was graceful and kind and recognized she took me by surprise. Flight attendant Lisa was delightful. Flight was on time and felt safe which is most important. I recommend this airline for safety, at least it felt that way. However, travel with a handicapped person was very difficult and I would be very cautious. Re carry-on baggage, beware.

### "awful customer service"
This is an awful airline with equally awful customer service. We missed a flight due to their inept employees, had to spend $2000 to fly home on a different airline, spent the night on an airport floor with two small children, and now their rules & regulations have somehow changed 3 times to accommodate their unwillingness to fix the problem. Horrible and cheap.

### "definitely not work the hassle"
Not Verified |   I chose to fly with Avelo - simply because I live in DE. The prices were comparable to other major airlines - especially when you add in all the fees. I will never fly with them again. Our flight was cancelled (and understandably things happen with travel). There was nobody at the airport to assist - we received a text and $150 for a room per reservation. The cheapest room I could find was $200. This is a late departure originally, so you are in limbo. We were informed that the flight would depart the following day, at 7pm. That got pushed back to 9 and then 10, and finally 11. We board the plane and have to wait for fuel. At no point do the pilots or the flight crew apologize for the late flight….anytime I have traveled the company is very apologetic, not this airline. Then the captain comes on and says we have to wait for another plane. We have been on the plane for an hour now - captain comes back on and says we aren’t leaving because both pilots are over their legal flight times….they knew this was a possibility, yet the company proceeded. So we are all off the plane - no communication from Avelo (the poor gate reps). We finally get the test. Again, no assistance from the company with helping find rooms - it’s past midnight. So we are set to leave - Friday afternoon - original flight was Wed. Night. The customer service - from the company is lacking. The employees are kind but the flight crew seems very novice. They don’t have the fleet to fix their issues. It is definitely not work the hassle. Very disappointing.

### "customer service experience unhelpful"
Not Verified |   Be aware when booking with Avelo Airlines! Our group of 10 had their return flight changed by 11 hours without any reasonable alternatives offered. Our original flight time was 5:30 PM and changed to 6:30 AM. No other flights that day (Sunday) until Thursday of the next week. The customer service experience was also unhelpful. Consider other options before choosing this airline.

### “Steer clear!”
Absolute worst airline ever flown with. Flight 588 returning home has been delayed twice then canceled until the following day in the evening. Once again it’s now been delayed again to even later in the evening. Our dogs are being boarded and we have no one to pick them up, money is running low and Avelo had the audacity to offer a $150 voucher to hotel PER reservation. Three people cooped up in a one bedroom hotel…awkward. When I spoke to Avelo customer service rep she confirmed Avelo can not accommodate in any way shape or form besides voucher. No help with car rental, no hope with utilizing another flight to get home with another airline, no help with food, no nothing! Never ever again using this airline. Steer clear!

### "there’s a ton of hidden fees"
Not Verified |   Thanks for cancelling my flight an hour before departure and not offering me an easy refund or different flight out! Also, there’s a ton of hidden fees they charge for things other airlines include for free. Skip it and fly Southwest.

### "pretty shady business practice"
Not Verified | I had a death in my family and had to get to FL asap. A friend suggested Avelo. I went to a travel website and compared flights. Avelo had good times and saved me $40 - Great. So I booked the flights thru the travel website. Then I go to do the online check in thru the Avelo website and I see that a "carry-on" bag costs $60 EACH WAY just like a "checked bag. I call customer service in Texas. I explain what happened and she tells me that its only $45 for a carry-on if you book thru their website (still too much money for a carry-on.) I tell her how I booked my flights, and she tells me they don't do business with them, so it's not Avelo's fault I wasn't warned. I told her that's a pretty shady business practice, and she starts giving me a civics lesson, talking about how "this country was built on capitalism! Well, Capitalism only works if the customer buys what you're offering. I cancelled my flights. You and Avelo can go to hell.

### "Very impressed with Avelo"
I flew Avelo for the first time with 2 of my daughters this weekend from Wilmington, DE to Tampa, FL. Everything went flawlessly. No they do not provide snacks on the plane, but that was not an issue as we knew to stop at a convenience store for whatever food we wanted to bring. They did offer complimentary water on the plane. The flight was on time. The crew was friendly and efficient. We had no issues. But what really stood out was that my daughter left an important school work folder on the plane. It had slid between the seats during the flight. She realized it in the hotel in Tampa. Later that evening, I received an email from an Avelo Customer Service Lead, Drew Perales, letting me know that they found her folder. He looked into my reservations and knew we would be flying back 4 days later and said to just see an Avelo crew member when we get back to Wilmington. Well 4 days later, my daughter had her folder back in her hands. I was just floored by this customer service. I feel like most people or airlines would have just tossed it. Very impressed with Avelo and will fly again.

### "Avoid this airline"
Not Verified |   Overcharged when calling to change my flight. The agent was rude. Right after booking I started receiving notices the Flight was delayed. Agent must have known. Avoid this airline.

### "they lost my luggage"
This airline is careless, they lost my luggage. I made a baggage claim they refused to send me an answer or my luggage. I sent them several emails but didn't get any response. I am so disappointed and I need my luggage.

### "Overall, friendly service"
Keep in mind Avelo is a budget airline, so no food (they do provide a bottle of water) & the seats are tight as are the seats on other budget carriers, ie Frontier, Allegiant, etc. I found the gate crew to be friendly, making intelligent announcements. The onboard staff was helpful & friendly and the pilot made timely and helpful announcements concerning weather & turbulence. The interior of the 737-800 was showing it's age- smaller overhead bins, the interior of which were scraped up, several over bin fluorescent lights were burned out, and the new seat material was torn on one of the seats in front of me. Overall, friendly service from a smaller no hassle airport, typical budget interior accommodations on older aircraft, the exterior of which is newly repainted.

### "had to cancel our entire vacation"
Pay the extra money that will get you an airline that will actually get you to your destination. Our flight from New Haven to Fort Lauderdale was delayed 9 hrs initially due to “weather”. The staff seemed just as clueless as the passengers flying. They simply kept pushing the delay back first by an additional half hour then an additional hour. Then suddenly they send us a text saying that there’s no crew for our flight and our flight is canceled and that all the flights for tomorrow are booked. So now we had to cancel our entire vacation due to the incompetency of the airport and airline. Very sad since I was going to see my grandparents before college starts but now I won’t have time.

### “very helpful, nice and polite”
Not Verified | So I got to the airport in New Haven. There is a lady at the counter with purple hair. She was very helpful, nice and polite. Usually when you go to an airport they rush you through and not talk or work with you or ask how your day is going. Things like that she asked how we were doing while she was checking us all in and doing her job bringing on a conversation which was very nice and polite. There was a slight situation with seating and she was able to fix that for us right away too. She went above and beyond in my eyes for her position. The plane ride was nice. Back and forth had no issues. I will fly this airline service again with no questions. Do recommend bring it on snacks. They do don't offer them on the plane but they do give you water if you need it when we left Tampa. It was much bigger than New Haven so you've had to wait in some lines to check in but other than that no problems.

### “experience has been a complete nightmare”
Flight was scheduled to leave Thursday 12/7 at 7 am. Was delayed until 7 am on 12/8. Multiple delays continued to occur. They said it was due to maintenance, but it was clear that no maintenance crew is wherever working on this flight. They continue to keep all passengers in the dark, giving no explanations. Most of the passengers booked with other airlines. The plane never left Orlando until Friday night 12/8. As you can guess, we incurred a lot of expenses in this process. And Avelo only allowed a minimal reimbursement for a hotel (150/couple) and one meal at 30 per individual. They refused to reimburse anything else. (And it is now 1/1/24 and we have still not been reimbursed by them - from 12/8/23). I strongly recommend that everyone think twice before using this airline. Our experience with Avelo has been a complete nightmare.

### "Avoid Avelo Airlines"
Not Verified |  Avoid Avelo Airlines. I chose Avelo due to the convenient location and cheap price, which I certainly regret now. In fact, the trip cost me more money and time. My flight from New Haven to Chicago was diverted to Kalamazoo, MI. There is no ground support to provide any directions after the landing. Avelo's customer support further refused my request to reimburse the journey from Kalamazoo to Chicago today. The experience is very frustrating in the holiday season. I will not fly and will not recommend anyone to fly with Avelo again.

### "people at the gate were just horrible"
The people that work at the gate for Avelo Airlines have been nothing but rude the last three flights I've been on. I bought my seat early and paid a lot of money for it, I paid for priority boarding as I am disabled. And people at the gate refuse to let me forward with the handicapped people because I was not in a wheelchair. I find this to be discrimination. I went to go ask the lady at the front when are we boarding, and she just said get back in line. I love Avelo, usually there's stewards and stewardesses are fine. But this time the people at the gate were just horrible. Put so much stress on me when I'm already stressed due to the pain in my arm. Have a level 3 torn tendon.

### "avoid Avelo despite its low prices"
The flights from Avelo are usually great but after having my flight get re-routed due to bad weather, I was stuck with having to wait two days before my next flight whilst being completely across the U.S. from my home or staying at the airport we got re-rerouted to and finding my own way home which is still very far. I have flown previously with Avelo but ended up having to wait an additional three hours as our plane had mechanical issues. I'm not sure if this is an unlucky streak or not but it is persuading me to want to avoid Avelo despite its low prices. My total delay time from Avelo over the course of two flights totals to around 13 hours unexpected delay time. This includes mechanical failures, weather and my total travel time that I needed to take, such as driving home from an unexpected state.

### “Horrible customer service”
So I’ve had zero problem with both Avelo and Spirit until today - I literally slept on the floor to catch this flight because there WAS no others - then was welcomed by the ‘supervisor’ in Orlando deciding my bag was a carry on and not a personal bag - which I’m no, it was NOT the size of a carry on and yes she charged me at the gate making for a wonderful Sunday morning - got it. Horrible customer service and if I’d had time to speak to a manager I absolutely would have - I feared missing my flight she was that awful about the whole things. Completely disgusted. Is it the airline or just this individual? Hopefully just this one or forget this airline it’s cheap because it SUCKS.

### "seating was so cramped"
The seating was so cramped. They put 3 seats in a row that should fit 2 people, which does not seem safe. My mother, who has a back condition, left the flight in pain because of the seating. Additionally, it cost us almost $300 to check our bags and we had to pay for our specific seats, which is absolutely misleading with their advertising of affordable flights. Finally, seats were dirty and they immediately loaded us on after another flight without cleaning anything.

### "Overall a nice airline"
Not Verified |  On the plane had 2 great flight attendants! The landing was a little rough though. On the way we were on time, but on the way back we were 45 minutes delayed. Overall a nice airline.

### "they had already closed the gate2
I arrived at the airport an hour ahead of departure time sat down and started working on my computer. I never heard a last call and when i realized it was 10 minutes before the departure time of the flight, I went to board the flight and learned that they had already closed the gate. This was Thanksgiving Day and I was going to see my 90 year old mother. I begged the person to contact the pilot, someone on the plane to open the door and he would not. they closed the door 10 minutes early and gave away my seat. This airline's route is very convenient for me but there's a reason why they have a 3 out of 10 star rating. They have terrible policies and in airport employees are mostly not helpful or kind. I have experienced Avelo to close their doors up to 30 minutes prior to departure resulting in my luggage not making it on the plane and too bad if you're not there and on the plane, you miss it.

### “This is completely unacceptable”
Not Verified |  I booked a flight in August to Melbourne Orlando airport. I was just informed today that they are no longer going to be flying into the airport and the only thing I was offered was refund of my original purchase. Unfortunately now I’m gonna have to pay over $600 to get airline tickets. This is completely unacceptable. They should not be allowed to just cancel your flight and not give you the option to fly to a nearby airport for the same price that you purchased the first one. When I said, I wanted to speak to a supervisor I was hung up on. They have absolutely no interest in helping people.

### "they just cancelled flight"
Not Verified |  Booked airfare thinking what a great price, I'm sure like everyone else. And then a month and a half before departure, they just cancelled flight. No reason given apart from scheduling conflicts. I mean, scheduling conflicts? Shouldn't an airline have hashed out their schedules before they offer tickets to customers. Anyway, the airline is a joke. Honestly, unless you don't care whether or not you fly, this isn't a reliable option for travel. Not sure if they cancel the flights that don't fill up, but either way whatever the reason, this is not a real airline like American or Southwest or whatever. Just be warned.

### "never fly with this airline again"
I flew on 11/16, flight was set to take off at 7:30pm, I didn't end up departing until well after 11pm. It was vital that I rent a car in order to get to my final destination, by the time I arrived the rental place was closed. I then had to spend un-budgeted money on a hotel to stay overnight and wait for the rental place to open only to run into further issues and end up unable to rent a car. This put a huge delay in a moving trip. The only reasoning given was airplane maintenance. Avelo issued a $25 travel fund credit to be used with their airline. While I appreciated the low rate of the one way ticket and the overall flight was smooth, I will never fly with this airline again.

### “Terrible experience both ways”
Flew RT from New Haven to Wilmington NC. Terrible experience both ways, they will not make it unless they make a lot of simple improvements. Paid for every possible extra, so tickets ended up being more expensive than a legacy carrier out of larger airport. Don’t pay for the priority boarding extra / they don't even honor it ($60 for 2 tkts RT - a waste). Gate agents were fairly friendly on both ends, however, in-flight staff were not and were poorly trained. On both flights, they did nothing but talk loudly non-stop with each other, right in front of us in the 1st row seats we paid extra for (how hard they work -laughable?, doing jello shots, etc). They blocked toilet access and seemed annoyed every time a passenger tried to get past. Will not ever fly again, unless it is only non-stop option. Recently flew Breeze for similar trip / a totally different experience - was excellent on all fronts. If you have the choice to fly another carrier than Avelo, you should and save yourself the misery.

### "refused to let me board my flight"
I recently had an absolutely dreadful experience with Avelo Airlines, and I feel compelled to share my story in the hopes that others can avoid the frustration and disappointment that I endured. Avelo Airlines not only refused to let me board my flight but also offered me flight credits instead of the refund I rightfully deserved. I had a flight booked with Avelo Airlines on 10/30/23, which was supposed to depart from Wilmington NC to New Haven I arrived at the airport well in before the departure time, excited about my trip. However, my excitement quickly turned to disbelief and anger when I was denied boarding at the gate without a proper explanation besides the workers felt like leaving early. The airline staff's vague and unsatisfactory response left me feeling humiliated and frustrated. I had met all the necessary requirements and had no apparent reason to be denied boarding. It was a humiliating experience, and the lack of transparency in their actions only exacerbated the situation. What's even more infuriating is that instead of issuing a refund for the fare I had paid for the flight, Avelo Airlines had the audacity to offer me flight credits. These credits were of no use to me, as I had no intention of ever flying with this airline again after such an appalling incident. My request for a refund was not unreasonable, given the circumstances, and it is my right as a paying customer to receive a refund when I was unjustly denied the service I had paid for. Avelo Airlines' insistence on providing flight credits instead of a refund is a blatant disregard for customer rights and satisfaction. Their customer service and complaint resolution procedures are clearly lacking, as they failed to address my concerns adequately. Overall, Avelo Airlines' refusal to let me board and their subsequent offer of flight credits instead of a refund has left me deeply dissatisfied and inconvenienced.

### "high rating for efficiency, timeline, and price"
Not Verified |  Extremely high rating for efficiency, timeline, and price. Please be aware they are Not Kidding when they say one small carry on. Ladies your purse or fanny pack must be consolidated into your carry on bag. Hopefully this Airlines stays in Salem and adds more flights to Bend Oregon and Phoenix AZ

### "An excellent experience"
An excellent experience. Cost was excellent, even the extra charges, if needed were very reasonable. Friendly and attentive staff, efficient and safe operation. No long lines, TSA at these smaller airports is very efficient and fast. Seats are standard for the Boeing 737 series. the flights are short, so just enjoy the convenience and the savings. Will use Avelo again when the need arises.

### "$65 to carry my backpack on"
I have flown with Avelo approximately a dozen times. I have always carried a standard size backpack which I have never been charged for by Avelo (or any other airline). Upon arrival at my gate I was informed that I would have to pay $65 to carry my backpack on, despite the fact that it easily fits under a seat. I explained to them that I've flown numerous times with them with the exact same bag and never had an issue. Their response was "too bad". Further, I paid extra for seat selection as I prefer to seat next to the window for viewing. Upon arrival at my seat I found the window shade to be inoperable and broken/stuck in the down position. After bringing it to a stewards attention, the response was "oh well".

### "I will not fly them again"
Not Verified |  Probably the worst airline ever when it comes to cancellations. We were delayed almost 5hrs due to mechanical issues. Those issues which were not addressed & order to take off, is very inadequate. The staff/crew are very kind and i feel so sorry for them due to the disrespect they receive. Just because it’s cheap doesn’t always mean good. I will not fly them again.

### "$65 for what was now considered a carry on"
Not Verified |  I had one small bag that I easily fit under the seat when I got on to the plane. I had done this for other flights with Avelo. This time they had 4 people at the gate. One told me my "personal item" computer bag was too large, Another told me I had to go into a long line of other passengers who also had to pay $65 for what was now considered a "carry on". Another to take my money. And another to check my ticket again. It was like they planned this event.

### "Better to take a real airline"
I thought I was getting on a cheap direct flight. At the gate, they started measuring my personal item and charged me $65! The bag size is their own version and totally took me by surprise. I will NEVER fly this airline again!! I don’t care that there’s no service, the planes are sold, everyone is crammed together. These are all expected but to charge me for a standard briefcase personal item is a matter of principal. They actually pulled more than 1/2 the passengers to measure and charged almost all of them $65! I’m sure there will be people who say that I should have known but it’s not the standard business model. Better to take a real airline where you know what you’re getting.

### "it works for us"
Myself and family have used Avelo several times. It’s no frills, little leg room, but for shorter flights it’s worth the convenience for us. We fly to and out of New Haven CT. Small airport 30 min from home. So in and out is a breeze. Staff were flat to very nice but no one rude. Price with picked seats and check bag was about $35 less than if we flew classic airline out of New York (2 hour drive) and $88 cheaper than Hartford (1 hour drive) So all said and done so far it works for us.

### "Never flying Avelo again"
I arrived to the airport an hr before my flight and was checking in my bag which was already paid for. The workers at the desk told me that my flight left even though I saw outside the window and on the TV screen that it hasn't. They then proceeded to tell me I can't check in my bag. I reached out to customer service about this through email, since that's the only way you can reach them about baggage, and they were very hypocritical and took forever to get back to me. It says on the website and ticket that check in counters close 30 mins before departure which means they should've taken my luggage since I was there an hour in advance. I then reached out to them again but then they never responded. Being affordable isn't worth using this airline. It was a waste of SO much money trying to get everything in that luggage to where I was. Never flying Avelo again.

### "staff was friendly"
New airline to our area (Daytona) and sceptical due to other reviews. Plane boarded on time, staff was friendly. Arrived to destination a little early. We did not pay for extras such as carry on or checked bags or pick our seats. If you do that then the price obviously goes up. That is how discount airlines work. Had a 20L back pack filled to the brim and no issues getting it under the seat. Also carried a coat with some items including wallet in pocket. As a plus, my co-traveler would have been sitting between 2 very large men and the staff moved her to an available front seat foe comfort. This was done before she even boarded and without us asking. Return flight was just as smooth. No snacks or drinks except water (they are short flights, you will live) If you are looking for bells and whistles, skip. If you are looking to get from one place to another then good option.

### "Nickel and diming at its worst"
I’ve never had an airline do this. Anyone who had a backpack, even small ones were forced to measure them. If your backpack didn’t fit the small dimensions of a carry on, you had to pay. Literally half of the flight got their carry ons checked and dozens paid $65 for carrying on normal and small backpacks. Just to be clear, I’ve attached a photo of my backpack which disappeared under the seat in front of me because it’s so small. Yet the gate agent made dozens of people pay. No normal backpack would pass this rule. Everyone was surprised. I’ve flown on lots of budget airlines and this is the first time my backpack was flagged. The flight attendant said my bag was fine. But the gate agent won out. Nickel and diming at its worst.

### "airline is a total joke"
Not Verified | This airline is a total joke it reminds me of a movie but even the movie had better customer service than these people. We booked online to Orlando to arrive on Thursday evening at 11:30pm we arrived at Airport early the customer service woman who took our bags was very nice but looked as if she was returning from a week long binge. We wait at our gate to be notified that the flight would be delayed 10 min later someone with a very unprofessional voice states we cant leave outside as the TSA people would be leaving and closing so we would not be able to leave go to the car anything. 10 min after that we receive a text message that the flight is canceled and the email that the flight was delayed. Very unorganized and unprofessional. The reason for the cancellation was as stated that the flight attendant fell and bumped her head (so I guess they only have one no backups.) So we called re: the refund some woman states I would be receiving my refund in 10-12 days. Our party lost a night at the hotel had to drive instead paid for gas etc. This airline is a joke.

### "Everyone was rude and disrespectful"
The absolute worst flying experience starting from check in. Our group of 6 (3 couples) booked together but 5 of us were seated together, in row 37, the last row on the small plane, and someone else was seated in row 10! This isn’t unusual on a flight though. When we went to check in we were checked by an extremely rude attendant who yelled at us through her teeth when we didn’t come up when first called because we were accessing our boarding but were walking up at the time. She was very short with answering questions & acted like we were inconveniencing her. We had to pay $65 a bag, even for carry on and there’s little to no carry on options offered for the group that placed us in so our bags had to go under the plane. When boarding our gate was moved to a different one and there was so much confusion because as per usual we go by what’s on our boarding pass. Everyone who worked for this airline was rude and disrespectful to every passenger that needed clarification on what was going on. We boarded our plane late, the seats are terribly small, so small my purse couldn’t fit under the seat, and of course they offer no entertainment or refreshments. The flight attendants were all rude. The only pleasant person we encountered was the one speaking over the intercom! When we got to the carousel, my husbands luggage had been completely ruined. The wheels were bent in, the case was cracked open in multiple places, along with numerous scratches and dents. The money you think you’re saving on this flight, you aren’t! They’re worse than Frontier! Do not use this airline!

### "I will never fly with them again"
Not Verified |  I flew on August 20th from Fort Myers to New Haven. I had a small carry on duffle bag. There were three employees who decided to hold up a flight by measuring everyone's bag size. Their maximum size is 14x9x9.5 and if your carry on is 1/2 inch larger, we will now charge you $65.00 and if you refuse to pay you cannot board. I had flown twice with Avelo from New Haven to Nashville and back with no problems with my bag size. When my concerns were expressed, the employee measuring the bags was very rude and condescending. This airline does not pride itself in good customer service. A complaint was filed with Avelo airlines with the same lack of empathy from customer service, we are sorry you felt Avelo did you a disservice is what I got. They would not even confirm that they would enforce the bag policy across the board at all airports. The stress this created was not worth it for me. I will never fly with them again. I advise spending a bit more money to have a good flight experience with better customer service.

### "This airline is not worth the hassle"
Not Verified |  This was my first experience with Avelo and never again. I am a loyal Breeze flyer and never had such issues. I had to cancel my flight and found that the wording on their cancelation policy is very misleading/confusing. After finding that I can only receive travel funds I went to my account online and by app yet these funds never appeared. I was told by a customer service rep (who had to ask others for help) that I must add these funds using the code I got by email. When asked how to do that I was told she did not know so again asked for help then came back and said to add them under ATF (like I was suppose to know what that was) Once identified as Available Travel Funds I told them there was no such thing on either my online account or app. she said "well thats what you do". I have printed the email and hope when I go to use it, for the last first and last time i will ever travel Avelo, that it will work. Otherwise I am out $189.00. This airline is not worth the hassle.

### "brutally rude at the gate"
Flew Avelo July 31 from RSW to ILG with a very small under seat suitcase that has qualified as a personal item on numerous airlines and trips. NOT Avelo, Their maximum size is 14x9x9.5 and if your carry on is 1/2 inch larger, we will now charge you $45.00 and if you refuse to pay you cannot board. So you think Avelo is cheap…not really…you purchase a ticket, then a seat, and now $45.00 for your personal item and they were brutally rude at the gate. Also note, all the other airlines have much larger size allowances including American and Frontier 18 x 14 x 8 and Southwest that could care less. Nope don’t think I will fly Avelo again - it’s not the cost but how devious this airline is.

### "charge for customer service"
Not Verified |  Avelo Airlines is another hustling cheap tickets like Spirit and Frontier. It really how you search for cheap tickets if is still available or not. There days that their prices is the same as any airlines. Remember Avelo charge for customer service so another gold digger.

### "no different from Spirit and Frontier"
Not Verified | Avelo sent discounts promo code like summer 23 or Finals50, Jet setter which all this codes purpose be 50% off the tickets at is available. Yes they have expiration day to make the reservation but they don't or give you accepting day, long story short they send you all this ads to your email and when you applied the code it don't work and had to call customer for help and they can't even don't know or don't know what to do. Just waste of time trying to book with them. I look at this new airlines company Avelo like Spirit or Frontier hustling people to fly with them. We know Spirits and Frontier Airlines are, there services and prices that people really not happy just little bit of saving that people get out of it. At end Avelo airlines is doing the same hustling people that flying with them is cheap but they really Not! They no different from Spirit and Frontier Airlines.

### "really ridiculous"
Avelo has many advantages but their "personal" item is so small that neither my purse on one flight, nor my briefcase on another, qualified because they did not fit in the EXACT dimensions (and the flight attendant took out a tape measure in Ft. Myers both times!!). Both were over by 1". In Wilmington, DE, they were not picky, but in Ft. Myers, they were AND if you did not purchase overhead storage--no matter how much extra there was, they would not let you put it there. They have the SMALLEST dimensions of of a personal item in the entire industry and it is really ridiculous.

### "very frustrating experience"
We, a family of three had an afternoon flight from New Haven to RDU on 7/16/23. We took the train from NYC and rode the bus to HVN. When we arrived at the gate, we were told the flight was canceled because of weather. However the airport was flooded since the morning. I do not know why we got the notification so late. If we were notified early, we could stay in NYC and arranged alternative much easier. Now we had to go back to NYC and try to take the overnight bus home because there were no other options. It cost us extra hundreds of dollar and a painful journey. Also, the rebooking option from the cancelation notification text does not allow us to book any later day’s flight even though some are available from Avelo’s website. The entire week after was greyed out. I tried to call customer service rep but was on hold for an hour and was disconnected. It was very frustrating experience.

### "ridiculously not customer friendly"
It’s cheap. The employees must be bound by strict policies because they seem like nice people. It’s ridiculously not customer friendly. I’m on a mostly empty flight but to switch seats costs $54. They strictly enforce the checked bag (which cost more than the ticket) at 50 pounds. One way they didn’t say anything about my backpack. The same backpack on the way back they want to charge me for a carry on. The advertised price is not the price. Your enjoyment of the flight is not their priority. BUT I gave it 3 stars instead of 1 because it’s cheap. If the prices ever increase I’d avoid them like the plague.

### "horrible customer service"
Not Verified |  This airline has horrible customer service. They made me pay for a carry on with a backpack that was not even questioned on the way down to Fort Myers. Do not fly this airline. They do not care about their customers and charge unnecessary fees. Not worth “saving” money on a ticket...because you don’t. Terrible experience.

### "treated like nothing but waste"
I highly suggest you not use this airline. The fact that my husband and I were refused on the flight because we weren’t there 3 1/2 hours before our flight and had time to make it to the flight still was not ok. The airport was not busy whatsoever. Then the team lead, or whatever she was, was rude to us. So much for customer service or even just human decency. It’s not that hard to be kind to one another. Especially in the early morning when no one wants to be up. Then the fact that she canceled the flight right in front of us and offered us a ridiculous option to reschedule when this is the only week we could’ve gone. Then told us we’d get a full refund only to find out we couldn’t. Just know if you want a full refund that you need to run in circles to find someone to actually care about your issue. Don’t use Avelo unless you want to be treated like nothing but waste! Spend the extra money and go somewhere that cares for you!

### "the most pleasant flight experience"
Go, Go Avelo! This was the most pleasant flight experience that I’ve had in decades. From the check in, boarding, the friendly, professional staff and the spotless cabin, it was wonderful. I was also impressed with the exterior of the plane. She was gorgeous, no dents or rusted rivets, and it looked like it had just rolled out of the factory! Part of the great experience was also the Wilmington and Charleston airports.

### "our experience was great"
I was apprehensive based on reviews but our experience was great. We checked a bag and the check-in was seamless. I would recommend arriving early since the employees who check-in are the same that do the boarding process. Everyone we spoke to was super nice including gate agents, flight attendants, and check in folks. We weren't expecting much in-flight but I thought the seats were fine. Plenty of leg room and I actually enjoy the no recline. It feels like people are lying in your lap on other airlines. Arrival and departure were on time. We'd fly Avelo again.

### "I would use them again"
Avelo is new to Wilmington DE. Avelo did an awesome job with leaving and getting there on time both ways. Sent out text for checking in. Checking in a checked bag went well with no issues. Paid for a carry on for meds, swim suit/change of clothes. Also took a small back pack for the I-pad, book, snacks that fit under the seat. No snacks offered, but a small bottle of water if you ask for it. Lead flight attendant did an awesome job getting a few people in line who kept getting up when the seat belt sign was on. I would use them again. Both ways they had a new flight attendant and they were very nice working with her to get her qualified. Now the Wilmington Airport is a different story. It is a small airport where you get on/off on the tarmac which is no big deal. On the return flight home, there was another Avelo plane a that just landed. When you walked into the area to get you baggage, it was jammed pack with people. 2 door slide up and bags where placed through the opening with everyone trying to see their bag. 2 planes worth of people. What a mess. It took 45 minutes by the time we were off the plane until we got our luggage. At one point they were loading stuff from one cart to another. It would of been easier if they did not have 2 planes unloading at the same time Yes we would fly with them again. Just have to have patience at Wilmington, DE airport.

### "Avelo used to be great"
Not Verified |  Avelo used to be great. When it started it was a lot cheaper and way more reliable. Now flights cost almost as much as a normal non-budget airline, and almost every time I have flown we have been delayed. I am currently waiting for my flight to Burbank and before today we received three emails in the last week that notified us that flight times were changed, and since sitting in the airport we have gotten three more emails. We are now over 3 hours delayed. No one is telling us anything. Just a more expensive version of Ryanair.

### "So many delays"
Not Verified | Well suppose to depart 8:30 am, first delay to 10:30, 2nd delay to 11:30, 3rd delay to 11:45, now 12:59 - where does it end? So many delays, finding out from the internet, no one from Avelo says anything to all of us passengers. Fly Spirit from Atlantic city - much more reliable.

### "Do not recommend at all"
Not Verified |  Do not book with Avelo if you even think you may have to adjust your trip. The wording on their refund policy is sneaky. Unless you cancel within 24 hours of your initial booking you get locked into having "Travel Credits". Additionally, like Spirit Airlines, they ding you with every fee possible for baggage. Do not recommend at all.

### "Get it together Avelo"
Not Verified |  You may be asking yourself why are Avelo flights so cheap? It is because they do not actually get you anywhere. At least I am convinced of this so far in my experience as I am writing this in the airport after my third delay from Avelo. Reasoning? No staff. And before anyone begins arguing about staffing, I realize there are shortages nationwide but honestly, that’s can’t be an excuse anymore. I work every day with fewer employees than I have had in the past, however, I do not overbook services to the extent that I find myself unable to provide realistic goals for my customers. Get it together Avelo. If you do not have staff, do not continue to book flights! Needless to say, I will never fly Avelo again.

### "Excellent experience"
Not Verified | Excellent experience. On time, plenty of room, employees were great. I will fly again. Arrived early both ways and left on time both ways. Checked a bag and paid for overhead storage no issues.

### "Never again will I fly Avelo"
We took a flight from Tampa to Wilmington at the end of April for a wedding. Never again will I fly Avelo. Our checked bags were lost on the way up. They went to Connecticut. We didn’t get them back the whole trip. We were told by multiple employees “purchase whatever you need, we know you’re here for a wedding”. We bought necessities. Clothes from target so nothing fancy. I bought drugstore makeup, so once again nothing crazy. Basic toiletries so we could shower and wash our hair. But when it came time to get reimbursed we were told they will not cover our toiletries or makeup. I did not want to spend half of our trip buying stuff to be comfortable. I didn’t want to put stuff on credit cards and get charged interest while waiting on payment. I didn’t want to spend the following weeks fighting with the airline over what is owed to us. Don’t fly Avelo. Book the more expensive flight. We are out more money than we would’ve been flying American. You live and you learn I guess.

### "evade taking responsibility"
This is to address a significant issue experienced by myself and the 17 passengers who were left behind on Flight 745. I had a booking with Avelo (confirmation 8J967D) for a flight on May 22nd, 2023. My girlfriend and I were prepared to leave our home well in advance of the scheduled departure time when we received an email informing us of a 30-minute delay. Subsequently, we received several more emails indicating further delays, a total of eight times. Unfortunately, none of these emails provided any information or alerts regarding the closure time of the TSA checkpoint. We arrived ontime at the airport for our rescheduled flight at 11:45 pm. To my surprise, there was no one present at the Avelo front desk at all. An airport employee approached us and informed us that we had missed our flight because the TSA checkpoint was closed, despite there still being ample time remaining. He stated that the TSA had closed at 9:30 pm, even though there was another flight scheduled for departure. Besides, on the CHO airport, it is clearly stated that "The daily closing time is dependent on the airline schedule and delays". More passengers arrived subsequently, with some needing to check in their luggage. However, there was still no one available at the front desk to assist them. After waiting in line for 25 minutes, I managed to reach an Avelo customer service agent over the phone. The lady I spoke with was courteous and assured me that I would be compensated not only for my flight but also for the hotel and any other costs incurred as a result of this incident. Unfortunately, she informed me that there was no alternative way for us to be accommodated on another flight. I made an attempt to contact them, but unfortunately, they changed their words. They simply resorted to using a generic template without addressing any of my specific concerns. It appears that they have a tendency to evade taking responsibility and often attribute the issues to external factors, rather than acknowledging and addressing their own problems. In some cases, they even go as far as abruptly ending phone calls, as if it is a common occurrence for them.

### "will be flying with them again"
This was the first time we used Avelo Airlines. I had read some bad reviews, but we thought we’d give it a try because the price was so good, and the airport is more convenient than PHL. We were very happy with both flights. They were on time, and the staff, both in the airports and in flight, were very polite, helpful and considerate. I have already recommended Avelo to our friends and relatives, and will be flying with them again.

### "recommend this with reservations"
I was a bit wary reading the reviews here after I purchased my one way ticket (I usually book a round trip with one airline but I booked two one way tickets due to the holiday period). Check in crew was fine and had no problems checking my prepaid bag in. Boarding process was a lot less orderly than Southwest and the seating was tight (Avelo does acquire used 737-700s from SWA, but uses another airline to buy 737-800s). I knew they didn’t have snacks so that didn’t bother me. But the flight was bumpy due to the weather and flight attendants were ok. The flight was on time, I made it in one piece and my bag was fine. I recommend this with reservations since they keep SWA competitive pricing wise.

### "not worth the hassle"
Not Verified | 0/10 they delay flights like it’s their job then rush you to board. Worst experience ever. Do not fly Avelo even though the prices are low it’s not worth the hassle. Never again !

### "Constant mechanical problems"
Not Verified | Constant mechanical problems which is a huge concern. Both flights (to and from) flight were delayed several times due to mechanical problems. Initially supposed to take off at 9 AM and was delayed 3-4 times. We did not take off until 1 PM. The return flight boarded on time but we are stuck on the plane delayed, taxiing back to the gate for the second time due to a second engine problem.

### "I guess you get what you paid for"
Not Verified |  We will not be using Avelo Airlines again. We booked round trip flights from Raleigh to Florida months ago. The departing flight was supposed to be on Saturday, May 20th and the return flight was supposed to be on Saturday, May 27th. Now that it's the week of our month's long, planned vacation, our return flight has been bumped up twice by 2 days from the 27th to the 25th. I called customer service to get our return flights cancelled and refunded as we have our house in Florida rented from the 20th through the 27th, and don't want to end our vacation 2 days early. The first customer service representative I spoke to was apologetic and very helpful with cancelling and refunding this flight. Minutes later, I got a confirmation email showing our return flight has been cancelled, except now it was showing our departing flight was scheduled for Friday, May 19th instead of Saturday, May 20th. I called again, and this customer service representative was extremely unhelpful and had an "it is what it is" attitude. I was told that to move our flight from the 19th to the 20th, we would incur extra fees, and the seats that we paid extra money for would not be guaranteed. I told her I didn't care about the seats as long as the cost would be refunded, but I would not be paying extra fees to switch my flight back to the 20th as this was an error on their end, not mine. She again tells me refunds would not be guaranteed, and the only way to switch my flight is if I paid an extra fee. I asked if there was someone else I could speak to in regard to refunding and she could not provide me with any information. Then, she proceeds to tell me that my flight cannot be switched from the 19th to the 20th, because there are no flights scheduled from Raleigh to Florida on that date. I don't understand how this is suddenly the case when, for months, our confirmation has shown our departing flight being scheduled on the 20th, and it was only changed to 19th moments after cancelling our return flight. It's just ridiculous. I'm not one to write reviews, negative reviews at that, and I am very reasonable. I understand the customer service reps have no involvement with changing flights, but her lack of compassion and inability to advise me on a solution to a problem created by Avelo, is just ridiculous. I guess you get what you paid for. Never again.

### "Never fly with Avelo"
My wife, daughter, and I, booked round trip flights from CO to CA to go be with my wife’s dying grandmother. We checked in 1:00a the day of online, for an 8:20p flight. We showed up 1.5 - 2 hrs early for the flight. We sat across the terminal walkway at the pizza hut to eat before we took off. We went to the gate 15 min before takeoff. Just to get turned away. Our boarding pass stated that we had to be at the gate 10 min before take off. Without any concern, compassion, or effort to get us on the plane, the staff just stood there and told us to try again and reschedule. BTW, they only fly Thurs and Mon out of CoS. Now to make sure we make it to spend time with Grandma before her time with us expires, we are driving from CoS to Burbank to pick up our two checked bags, then drive back to Riverside to get house where she’s on hospice. Never fly with Avelo, they are awful.

### "the crew and plane was amazing"
After reading the reviews I was worried my girls was going to have a horrible flight. But to our surprise the crew and plane was amazing. The crew was pleasant and the plane was comfortable. I would love for this airline to fly to more locations so I can use them more often. I will look up this airline first to see if they can accommodate my travel before the big corporation airlines.

### "Customer service is inadequate"
If you ever have to cancel your flight, they will conveniently lose your travel funds and you’ll never see them again. I spent countless hours sending them the proof that they owed me travel funds and they just said that they couldn’t find them and that it was the customers responsibility to keep track. What a joke I sent everything that they had sent me. how can I give them travel funds numbers to research what’s owed to me if they never gave them to me in the first place. Customer service is inadequate and in accurate and they do not care if you are owed. If they say they cannot locate your travel funds on their end it, then you lose. I will never ever fly Avelo Airlines again, and if I am asked by anyone in my area, how I like them, I will always tell them the full story.

### "Horrible customer service"
Do not book Avelo! They delayed our return flight from Tampa to Raleigh multiple times last night and then cancelled at 11.45pm, minimal notifications regarding the cancelation and didn't offer a rescheduled flight or alternative route. They suggested we attempt to contact their customer service to rebook on another flight home within 7 days, we called customer service multiple times and was on hold for over 45 minutes. Never got a hold of anyone. We ended up having to book a flight home with another airline. Avelo says we will be reimbursed within 7-10 days...will see. No offer to help with hotel accommodations or anything. Horrible customer service.

### "never fly Avelo Airlines again"
I will never fly Avelo Airlines again. The flight down to Wilmington was great! We were very excited to have a direct flight to Wilmington, as my brother lives there. Our experience leaving Wilmington, however, was not so wonderful. My son and I arrived at the airport an hour before the flight was supposed to leave. Wilmington is a small airport, so we had plenty of time. The flight was scheduled to leave at 12:00. We arrived at the gate at 11:35 and the gate was already closed. There were no employees anywhere to be seen to help us. My son started waving to the groundcrew of the airport, got their attention and they ran up the ramp to alert the airline crew. He came back down and gave us a thumbs up. We assumed that they were going to come open the gate and let us on. Nope. Next thing we see is the loading ramp pulling away from the airplane. When the gate crew came back into the airport, we asked why they would not let us on and we were told that they were not allowed to reprint the manifestation. They were young kids that clearly did not care about us, or the other two passengers, one of which was in a wheelchair and had been in the bathroom, that they left behind. When we asked when the next flight out was, we were informed not until Monday. This was on a Friday. Needless to say, we could not wait until Monday to fly home. I spent a lot of money to get us on a flight the next day into Boston. My car however was in New Haven! I then called the airline itself and they said that they did nothing wrong, and that they can close the gates a half an hour before the flight is supposed to leave if they want, even if they do not have all of their passengers on board. No offer of a refund or anything.

### "will never fly Avelo again"
Not Verified | We were diverted to Delaware because of weather in New Haven at 12:00 4/17, we landed in Delaware at 2:00, (weather was clear in New Haven by 3:00, our ride that was waiting verified this). We were never informed of when we would fly out, even as we asked multiple times, finally left at 6:30 but when we landed in New Haven we were kept on the plane for 1.5 hours before we were able to get off the plane. Unacceptable, will never fly Avelo again

### "Never again Avelo"
My family has flown Avelo several times in the past year with no issues, small airport in New Haven is 10 minutes from home, Prices were comparable to Bradley airport. We flew this same flight back in January. However, our experience on March 26 was a disaster. They’ve added more flights out, 5 planes, one every half hour. There were too many passengers and not enough time to process everyone (website says arrive ahead 90 minutes and boarding pass says 120 minutes, so potentially 4 flights x 189 people each are all there at the same time). Add to this the terminal isn’t completed and they work out of construction trailers! The lines were super long. At one point in the TSA line, we stood in the same spot for over 20 minutes. We finally got through screening area, and an Avelo worker strolled by, saying the FLL flight was closed and everyone had to rebook. We got to the gate at 7:17 for a 7:30 flight; the plane was still there. 40 passengers missed it, and 20 people missed the 8:00 flight. Staff was super rude, just repeating the customer service number to rebook and saying it was our fault not being there on time. To add insult to injury, the plane left 2 minutes ahead of schedule and landed 17 minutes early. We heard later that TSA shut down for a security issue, delaying everyone a half hour. That doesn’t sound like our fault. There are just 2 boarding gates that are literally a 60 second walk from the TSA area. How is it possible that Avelo didn’t think to hold the flight for 10 minutes for 40 people when we were all there? We missed a cruise because even though I could have gotten a plane from Hartford and made it to Florida, my luggage was on the plane. Worse, my trip insurance doesn’t cover missed flights, so I’m out over $3500. Never again Avelo.

### "employee didn't believe me and made me pay"
I was very disappointed how I had to pay $50 for a carry on, my son was in a wheelchair and could take his own bag. The employee didn't believe me and made me pay. I had purchased 6 tickets and would never fly with this airline again.

### "both flights were seamless"
I had my doubts after seeing bad reviews, but both flights were seamless. They left on time and arrived early, even though it was spring break. The smaller airport at Wilmington was easier and quicker to navigate.

### "staff service was non-existent"
Not Verified | Avelo Airlines has to be one of the worst flights I've ever experienced. You really get what you pay for. We were rushed to sit down by very pushy staff, claiming we had to disembark if the plane was not seated at a certain time because they "had a late start to their day" because they didn't want to pay for the noisy aircraft fee—that shouldn't be our responsibility. New airline or not, your job should be to get people from A to B as comfortably as possible. The staff service was non-existent, only coming in at the end to collect trash that it'd be impossible to have because again, no one served us anything or even offered. The plane was one of the least smooth I've ever ridden on, you could feel every slight pressure change and altitude change CONSTANTLY, and water kept dropping down from places unknown, and that I'd rather not think about. The seat belts wouldn't fit even a person of average size (I'm around 200 pounds, but not big) and that's at max extension, even the tables were shoved too close into you, but without service what use should you have for them, huh? TLDR: Don't fly Avelo, their incompetence and cheap nature is scathing and reflects how they'll treat you. Your flight will either be cancelled or delayed constantly, so leave early regardless.

### "To good to be true"
Not Verified | Avelo set the bait now they’re yanking on the hook. Reel everybody in with low fares for the first year then raise the rates so you can’t afford them next year. To good to be true. Prices are going up up and away see ya. So much for the little guy!

### "Never check a bag with Avelo"
Do not expect checked bags to arrive at destination on a 2 hour direct flight!! And do not expect to get your bag for several days. My bag and 6 other people’s bags were no shows at our destination of Binghamton, NY on a Saturday morning. We were told we may have to wait until Wednesday when Avelo flies back to Binghamton! Avelo’s “Baggage Team” does not work weekends or holidays. So there is no one to start working our issue until Monday even though our baggage “delay” happened on a Saturday morning. There is no communication and no updates. Calls to customer service are futile and no supervisor to speak to until Monday morning. Never check a bag with Avelo!

### "staff seemed like they somewhat cared"
This airline is trying but they could be a lot better. The staff is mostly friendly but there are some really rude people that will kick you out of open seats if you move, etc. which makes zero sense since the plane is in the air. This happened to me and my niece on separate flights. I get that it is their business model but ultimately you are just going to just annoy people and lose business that way (see one-and-a-half-star review). They only offer water which is fine but no one handed it out or even checked on you. The two female flight attendants on my flight just sat in the back and gossiped the entire flight. The pilot seemed kind and the rest of the staff seemed like they somewhat cared but most look tired and were pretty cold. A smile goes a long way in this business.

### "flight had been delayed an entire 24 hours"
My flight was originally scheduled for 0920PM but was delayed about ten minutes before boarding. Hundreds of people were at the gate with the same notification that the flight was delayed until 2AM. The gate next to us was supposed to board 3 hours before we were and were still waiting to find out when they were leaving. The gate attendant disappeared down the ramp and closed the door behind her, leaving the entire area void of any staff to answer any questions. People coming off the plane in wheelchairs were left at the gate without their belongings or their assistance to get to bag claim. I have been unable to get ahold of customer service nor get a refund even though I purchased the insurance. Hearing all the complaints and seeing how delayed others were on their flights headed to Florida hours earlier, I went ahead and booked a flight on a larger airline for the AM and promptly went home. We were given no announcement at the gate and subsequently told there was enough staff to even pull the luggage off the plane. By the time I got up for my flight the next morning, this flight had been delayed an entire 24 hours. I never received any kind of confirmation that the flight even left. The website is unusable and will not even pull up my booking with the confirmation I was given.

### "poor customer service"
Very frustrating, mainly poor customer service. The employees at the Orlando terminal were not helpful, rude and didn’t share information. The plane was delayed numerous times, but no notifications were given after the first few. There was no explanation for the delay, ever. At one point the employees got on/off the plane with no explanation. And then they all went back on the plane and locked the door. Leaving no employee at all inside the terminal. If you approached the desk or attempted to ask questions you were shooed away or lied to. Then when time to board we were rushed, completely unprofessional and unsafe, onto the plane. No boarding groups at all. Just a big line, they even said “we have 5 minutes to get you on, hurry”. It’s very unfortunate given the lower cost and convenience of flying out of smaller airports that this company can’t do better. Customer service goes a long way. I’ll spread the word to my locals to be wary of this company until they have improved their customer service team, and consider hiring someone else to staff their terminal that is more professional, empathetic, and safe.

### "service is not worth the headache"
Do not fly Avelo! This has been the worst airline experience of my life and I am a seasoned traveler. Delays both ways in excess of 12 hours total with absolutely no information on why or how long. They just kept saying “we’re boarding shortly” which turns into hours. That was after we boarded the first time after a 45 minute delay only to be told we had to get back off and ended up waiting another 5 hours. The desk clerks are rude and there are zero offers or alternatives for reimbursement or accommodations. All they say is call customer service and getting through to is impossible. I recently lost my job so decided to give them a shot since they are so cheap, but never again. Their service is even cheaper and not worth the headache. The only upside was once in the air, it was a smooth flight.

### "Delays that are hours long"
Cancel, delay, delay last minute every time we book with this airline. Delays that are hours long. Never a free ticket or offer. I’m tired getting in after midnight and who knows on the way to the airport I’m sure I will get a text there is another delay. I know it’s not weather related it’s just incompetence. Last time when we left out of New Haven they charged us five dollars to print our ticket. When we got home I after a delay I found the text that the plane was delayed 15 minutes after takeoff. So how could I have gotten my ticket on my phone when I was already on the plane. They are so cheap plus the lady at the ticket desk was rude.

### "staff was super helpful"
First time flying Avelo, staff was super helpful at the Tweed airport! He was super attentive to me and my friend flying and answered all our questions. In all the chaos from a delayed flight he made sure that we were informed and taken care of.

### "I would fly with them again"
As someone who does not enjoy flying, Avelo Airlines was a good experience for me. I was worried about being on a “cheaper flight” but everything seemed similar compared to a non-discount airline. The customer service of the flight attendants was great! They were very personable, friendly, and helpful and made me feel at ease. The only downside was that there is no offer on food or drink on the plane, but it wasn’t a huge deal for a short flight. The only other negative comment was that the plane was overbooked, so 3 passengers had to opt out of their ticket. Overall, Avelo was a good experience and I would fly with them again!

### "Avelo changed my flights"
Not Verified |  Avelo changed my flights to days that I can't even travel. I had specific days that I needed to arrive and depart. That was the first issue! Second, I went online (because it is impossible to speak to anyone at Avelo) and canceled the new flights expecting a refund. No! They issued a "travel credit". As if I want to fly this airline ever again. I have e-mailed customer support multiple times and have never had a response. I have called Avelo only to wait on hold for over an hour before giving up. I have never had such a poor experience with any company.

### "I will not give them my money again"
I have not ever left a Yelp review before (believe it or not, I dont think I’ve ever left a business review of any kind before this). I cannot emphasize this enough: we will not fly on Avelo ever again. First, our flight (XP 719) was delayed due to being overweight. As a result, 30 passengers were asked to volunteer to take a later flight (yes, overbooked by 30 passengers). We were delayed because Avelo wanted to wait until people took their buyout option, which was raised continuously over the course of an hour until 30 people had accepted. The delay was not weather or technical issue, it was a known mistake by Avelo that we, the passengers, had to simply absorb. Unbeknownst to any of us, Avelo had also decided not to put over half of the checked bags onto the flight. Avelo knew this before we took off and said nothing. We landed and waited for nearly 2 hours at the baggage claim, a group of approximately 40 passengers waiting for our bags. Finally, an agent came to tell us that the bags had never been loaded (again, they made this decision hours ago before departure but did not inform us). Our options were to get in a makeshift line and give our bag claim info (again) to this agent who slowly repeated the claim numbers into her cellphone. We could have Fedex deliver the bags, no promise when they would arrive OR come back to the airport in the middle of the night to retrieve them, but they weren’t sure which flight it would be or the exact arrival time. I was told Avelo would call during the night to confirm my bag had arrived (this did not happen). The next morning I called both Avelo numbers and sat on hold for 90 minutes and 60 minutes respectively, no one picked up. I called Orlando airport’s customer service and was helpfully transferred to an Avelo agent there. That person said my bag was not there and she could not say where the bag was or what the process would be for finding it (“Just call the customer service number!” she said). I began frantically calling the departure airport, was given an Avelo work phone to call, left a voicemail. Then, I received an email explaining that due to weight restrictions, many bags had not been loaded onto the flight, come pick up your bag and get a $50 credit for an Avelo flight. On this email, I saw my name had been wildly misspelled. So, I called Orlando and was transferred yet again to the Avelo agent. She laughed and said, “Oh right! I realized your bag is here after you called, you can come get it.” She could not explain why she didn’t just call me when she found my bag. I had given her my phone number. She could not tell me how to file a claim to be reimbursed for the additional cab fares to and from the airport to get my bag (this doesn't even touch the toiletries and rental car I had to cancel because I was stuck waiting for my bag at the airport the previous day, despite Avelo knowing that my bag was not there). She referred me again to the customer service number that no one answers. As it stands, my wife will need to cancel some of her plans today so that she can be with our son while I cab back to the airport again to find my bag. The total lack of communication and thoughtlessness on the part of Avelo is not something I can forgive. I am generally tolerant of mistakes and unforeseen problems that arise with air travel, its just part of the reality of flying, but to have my time and stress so completely disregarded by this company means that I will not give them my money again.

### "cancelled 4 hours before my flight"
Not Verified |  Flight was cancelled 4 hours before my flight time and I did not get any notification. Got dropped off after driving 1 1/2 hours to airport to told it was cancelled with no other options. Stuck 1 1/2 hours from home with no cares at all from Avelo customer service

### "Several delays, both ways"
Never again. For so many reasons. Several delays, both ways. Coming back, take off was supposed to be 4:45 pm, actually took off at 930 Pm, after being told screws were missing and they couldn’t get what they needed. Everything just seemed to take forever and no one really knew what they were doing. Just don’t do it. It’s not worth the Pennies you may save by flying with them.

### "unhappy with bag check-in service"
Not Verified | I was very unhappy with Avelo Airline’s bag check-in service and boarding process at Tweed Airport in New Haven on the afternoon of February 24. I had to take my bag to a check-in clerk in a temporary building attached to the terminal and then wheel it into the terminal after she attached a ticket to the bag. In the terminal I had to push the bag under a plexiglass opening to a TSA person. Next, I prepaid for priority boarding but nobody cared about that. There was a crowd of people trying to push through the gate. The boarding was 100% outdoors. Part of the ramp to the door of the plane was steep.

### "worst customer service experience"
This very well could have been the worst customer service experience of my life. The plane arrived an hour ahead of our departure time and everyone looked excited to fly home to New Haven. As our scheduled boarding time came and went all the passengers started to get nervous. About 20 minutes after boarding an announcement was made that they would need to have 29 people off the plane or we could not take off. They offered minor compensation for a huge disruption and only 22 people took the offer. Unfortunately 7 people were denied boarding and told you aren't getting home tonight. As we finally board the plane an hour and a half later I was sat next to a window whose internal frame was no longer attached to the airplane with anything other than my broad shoulders and arm holding it. Even though I understand this is not the "outer window" that keeps the plane sealed, it did create an extreme feeling of discomfort for even a seasoned flyer. The airplane felt like a 30 year old relic that had seen better days and was destined to be retired a long time ago. While I will never fly Avelo again for the reasons outlined above, I will say that the flight attendants on all my Avelo flights have been professional and kind to all passengers despite the enormous amount of disappointed customers they have to deal with due to their company structure.

### "never again"
Avelo Airlines began service out of Palm Springs last November. I needed to travel to Eugene OR for business, so decided I would give them a try. I was scheduled to depart at 1:30 pm - early that morning I began receiving emails from Avelo advising the departure time had been delayed. Over the course of the day I continued to get successive emails (8 emails in all) moving the departure later and later each time. The flight finally departed at approximately 9:00 pm, a total delay of 7.5 hours late. The gate agent said she had no idea why the flight was so late and once on board the pilot only apologized for "the inconvenience. The delay was not  due to weather, so no one really knows why. Bottom line: I gave Avelo my business once, but never again.

### "What a waste of time"
My flight from PBI to RDU was delayed twice and was notified via emails, which was ok. Then the flight was cancelled. I found this out at the airport and was never sent an email or text. At the airport after waiting in a very long line for the one attendant, who told me she couldn't do rebooking, I would need to call customer service. I tried three times to reach customer service each time after being on hold for over 30 minutes I would be cut off! I never reached them and gave up! What a waste of time. And waste of money booking another flight at the last second!

### ""Worst airline experience ever
Worst airline experience ever. The most unprofessionally run, amateur outfit I have encountered after 3 million miles flown and 70 countries. Will never fly this airline again. A true embarrassment to the industry.

### "uncomfortable overcrowded gate area"
Not Verified | Don’t do it. The airport is not adequate for the volume of passengers trying to board. The communication and signage is terrible from the moment entering the terminal. Very uncomfortable overcrowded gate area. Definitely not worth the discount price.

### "attendants were quite pleasant"
Wilmington to Fort Myers, a route I have flown from different departure airports (BWI and PHL) and airlines many times. The checkin at Wilmington DE was uneventful, I have precheck and always have a personal carryon with an ipad and was instructed to remove it by TSA - a first in all my travels. The waiting room was very crowded and no one was wearing a mask and this the first flight I decided not to wear one. The boarding process was organized and the only issue I had was, my original reservation was for seat 3C but my ticket/boarding pass was for 6C or a seat $3.00 less in value. The flight attendants were quite green and stumbled as they read the canned announcements but were quite pleasant. The flight was on time and disembarking was normal. My one negative was coming down with Covid 3 days later and giving to my wife. I have always worn an N95 when flying commercially and this is the first time I did not and severely regretted it.

### "You get what you pay for"
You do not get refreshments and in-flight amenities. You’re getting what you pay for: affordable transportation. Avelo flies to and from small regional airports that aren’t serviced or are under serviced by larger carriers and do not have daily service. Check-in was easy on the website. I did elect to pay for seat selection and the $14 was worth have a row to myself. The incoming flight from New Haven was late. So boarding was delayed but the flight itself was not. Quick turnaround time by the staff. The plane is an older 737. The planes do have different cabin configurations. This one had the smaller and harder seats. Still better than Spirit but a similar quality. Took off without issue. The flight itself was uneventful. Unfortunately the weather in CT did not agree with this. It was incredibly windy with a pretty severe amount of turbulence. We had two missed approached and held over the LIS for about an hour. The pilots informed us what was going on after the second attempt when we entered the holding pattern. Unfortunately that was not a particularly fun hour with the turbulence over the water. I fly often and am not a particularly nervuous flier but I was not comfortable. Be advised at New Haven we had airstairs and had to walk off the ramp and I did not check luggage but luggage claim at Tweed if outside. Traffic at Tweed was horrendous and the airport itself needs to address that if they’re going to have commercial flights. You get what you pay for. Extremely economic transportation in and out of rarely serviced airports. Would fly again.

### "I will fly Avelo again"
Return leg of my last review. The mentality stays the same. You’re getting what you pay for and nothing less. This leg was considerably less eventful than my last trip. I did not check a bag or have a carry on as they are quite pricey. Tweed was a small airport and I was in and through TSA in about an 10 minutes. There was no jet bridge at Tweed for this flight and we entered via airstairs. I have absolutely no issue with this but be advised. Plane boarded and departed on time. This was a former SWA 737 and had a better, more comfortable interior than my last flight. It wasn’t particularly clean but no worse than my last AA or Spirit flight. Cabin crew greeting us when entering the plane but outside of that were nowhere really to be found. They did offer a small bottle of water on this leg about halfway through. If you’re looking for an economical, no frills carrier this is a fairly good one. For the price I can return to where I used to live to visit family monthly if I wish. I will fly Avelo again.

### "Excellent experience"
Not Verified |  Excellent experience, all around. Departure at the little airport was so easy, just three people on line for security, so easy and so fast to the gate. The price can not be beat. Gate staff and the flight attendant five stars all around. I had to cancel my return flight and it was extremely easy to reach them by phone to cancel it for a full credit just 36 hours before the flight. My traveling companion had to cancel the bag she pre-paid to bring on the plane and it was very easy for her to cancel over the phone for a full credit.

### "customer service was phenomenal"
Not Verified |  I don’t understand how there are so many negative reviews. Made sure to keep checking the flight for any changes. The customer service was phenomenal right off the bat. The employees were respectful and friendly. The flight arrived on time and everything was smooth. Aircraft was clean and in order. Flight attendants were helpful. We arrived on time. Well worth the price and more. Will fly again.

### "the worst customer service"
Not Verified |  Literally the worst customer service. I called to change my 2 carry on bags to checked bags,. it was going to cost an additional $20. Half way thru the call I said I changed my mind. Customer Service rep,  said I could not change my mind and offered a huge attitude, in which I responded I want to speak to a manager. 18 minutes later a total of 47min on hold, I still had not spoken to a manager. But lo and behold my reservation was returned to how it started. Folks do not make a mistake on your reservation!

### "This trip was horrendous"
This trip was horrendous - I arrived from Orlando to New Haven on 12/23. Pilot attempted to land at Tweed 4 or 5 times but could not land due to wind (during all this, not one communication came from either the flight attendants or pilot). My family had arrived to pick me up at Tweed only to watch these attempts for over 1 hour, constantly checking status of flight which continued to say on time to finally going into the terminal to be told the flight was rerouted to Bradley in Hartford and landed there several minutes ago. My family proceeded to drive from New Haven to Hartford to pick me up which was now over 2 hours behind schedule. Once we arrived in Hartford/Bradley, we the passengers were notified by the flight attendant/pilot that the doors were frozen and that we were unable to get off the plane. I called my family who told me to tell them to get the deicer and open the door. After another hour (mind you we did not have a gate and waited another hour trying to locate one), the attendant and pilot came on to tell us that were were heading back to New Haven because the wind subsided! I rang my buzzer and told the attendant I wanted off the plane. They finally allowed the passengers off the plane and of course, any luggage that was not carried on would have to be picked up tomorrow in New Haven. If we had arrived as planned, we would have been home at 9PM however because of all of this commotion we did not arrived home until 1AM - mind you New Haven is a 40 minute ride from our house in CT. There never was any communication, no apologies or anything. The story continues on the way back on Wed Jan 4 - we get to the airport on time, everything seems ok, my family heads out after dropping me off. Turns out they overbooked and wanted 4 people to get off the plane and get a 400 voucher - guess what only 1 person would get off the plane - so next saga is that they had to get a bigger plane - so we transferred from 1 plane to the bigger - finally getting off the ground 2 hours after scheduled departure. We arrive in Orlando again only to be told that there is no gate, there is no staff because the plane arrived after midnight, so by the time that was all said and done, we did not get home until 4AM. Its not worth the extra pennies you save on this airline.

### "not able to talk to somebody"
Not Verified |  I'm trying to check in to my flight back to Florida and when I try to do the check in through the website it says my booking information can't be found. First few times I tried to call their customer service, the call would drop and I couldn't get anybody on the phone. Now, I finally got the automated call and have been waiting for over an hour to talk to a customer service representative. I understand that this is a cheap flight, but not able to check in and not able to talk to somebody is not acceptable.

### "the customer service is horrendous"
So this has been by far the worst Airline ever! They give you a constant run around with the verbiage of “we will update you every 5-10 mins” yet they update us every 30 mins. I have been stuck here waiting to head back to CT yet I’m stuck at the airport since 1/3/23 at 3.30 pm only to be told at 9 pm that they flight is cancelled and to show up at 5 am to depart by 7 am yet it is 7.38 am and we still have not boarded. They are people here since 1/2/23 dealing with this same issue with Avelo. Crew and staff are not knowledgeable and the customer service is horrendous. Regardless if it’s an “affordable flight” all of this mayhem should not be occurring 3 days in a row. The plane is small, uncomfortable, tight seats, no wifi, no water, nowhere to charge your devices, nothing! If all of this cannot be accommodated, then at least make the experience a good one. Get us on board on time as we are doing our part in being here on time! Now we are being told that we cannot board for the following reasons: They are waiting for the flight crew (unacceptable when we have been here since 4.30 am and told to be here by 5 to depart at 7) secondly now they are saying that the crew arrived but needs a total of 10 hours to be rested. Then why have us here hours early just to be delayed? We were supposed to depart at 7 yet it’s almost 8 am and we are still waiting to be told when we can board. Countless other flights have departed and arrived with no issues and even the ones that have we hear over the intercom information about those flights yet Avelo doesn’t have any. And the excuse is always 5-10 mins we will update you. I sincerely will never fly this airline again and I will inform family and friends who are scheduled to fly within the next few weeks to cancel their flights and get a reimbursement because this is absurd. I’m missing work because of this huge inconvenience and yet nothing has been resolved. Even the so called NEW Boarding Pass did not have the todays date but rather 1/3/23 and we had to wait almost 25 mins to get TSA Management to let us pass the check in section to board the shuttle train to the departure section. Total mess in every aspect. I would have rather flown any other airline and and paid the difference!

### "Overall terrible experience"
I will never fly with Avelo ever again. On our way out of Kalamazoo I repeatedly received texts saying our flight was delayed further, and further. Finally made it to the airport only to have it delayed yet again. By the time we boarded the plane we were delayed at least 4 hours. Once on the plane, we were told the plane was overweight and they would be removing 13 passengers checked bags from the flight. Of course our name was one of them. Everything I needed for our trip was in the checked bag. Our only 2 options were to stay with the bag and miss our trip, (the next flight they could get us on was Friday, this happened on a Monday) or fly without our bag and they would either A. Send it on Friday with the next plane or B. Overnight it. Unfortunately it is now midnight and they have no answers for us on anything because they're customer service reps are unavailable until 8 or 9 in the morning. So we made the choice, we left our baggage behind and continue on our way. HOWEVER, at this point, another hour sitting on the plane waiting, the pilots are about to timeout. They quickly push back to get into the air, but need to de-ice first. Fine, whatever. We go to take off, the pilot aborts the first take-off attempt and we sit and wait yet again for him to figure out his problem. We FINALLY take off on the second attempt, and it is 6 hours from when we're originally supposed to take off. As for the lost baggage, we finally received our baggage that they left behind on Monday, Saturday. We reached out to customer service every day with Ridiculous hold times, told us they would call us back numerous times, but NEVER did. Finally we received an email with a lost baggage checklist, then they shipped it. Now as for on the way home. Everything went smoother this time, but we still were an hour and a half delayed. Overall terrible experience. Terrible customer service. I don't care about the price, pay more money for another airline and get a seamless experience.

### "my worst flight experience"
Not Verified |  By far my worst flight experience. My scheduled take off time from HVN was 5:40pm. Around that time we were told that the flight would be delayed to around 7:30 take off. The flight was they re-delayed multiple times ranging from at take off at 6:30, 7:50, 7:00, and back to 7:50. When I asked the staff what was going on the response was “we are doing the best we can”, which I understand; however when you have an entire flights worth of individuals confused on why so many delays, a true explanation should not be that hard to provide - whether it be weather, plane issues, etc. the people deserve to know. Avelo Airlines staff are horrible with communication and delays. In addition, their check in process is awful as they check people in by their flights instead of their place in line causing more backup and confusion. I am now boarding my 5:40 flight at 8:07pm still with no explanation of why it was delayed. Avelo might be a cheap way to travel to certain places via a direct flight, but they are not worth the confusion or hassle.

### "lack of communication - horrific"
Boarded flight from PBI to HVN on 12/31/22. During boarding, there was an issue as two teens weren't allowed to board due to the plane being overweight. Pilot said that we had to carry extra fuel due to weather in New Haven. After 45 minutes of a standoff the girls boarded the plane. No clue what changed to allow that. The first attempt to take off was aborted due to a light going off. We pulled off the runway and waited until that cleared. So an hour after our scheduled departure we took off. We didn't land at our estimated time and it was clear we were circling. When we finally landed 20 minutes after the pilot said we would, he then announced that we were in Hartford. Once in Hartford, we were stuck on the tarmac for 90 minutes until a gate opened up. When it did, we were allowed to deplane with zero communication from flight crew about next steps. In fact, it was only a BDL employee at the gate that mentioned that our bags weren't being unloaded. Hopefully they will show up in New Haven today but we've heard nothing from Avelo and it's impossible to get through to them. I understand that weather happens. I've been delayed and diverted before but the lack of communication and safety concerns were horrific.

### "Avelo has been the worst by far"
I have traveled with my family over twenty times using different airlines over the past 20+ years. Avelo has been the worst by far. It is supposed to be a cheap way to fly but the tickets were $800 round trip from New Haven CT to Palm Springs. The planes are so old they don’t even have the old school radio in the arm rest, you can’t charge a phone. The seats are so cramped that I couldn’t put my carry on under the seat for the first time ever. They have no snacks on the flight and only warm water but you have to ask. The flight home was a disaster because they sent an update saying that the flight was delayed but when we arrived at the airport we were told it was on time and all boards said on time. There was no agent at the counter to even speak with and the flight ended up being delayed three hours with no updates. Never again will we use this airline, it’s not worth the few dollars that we’re saved.

### "Avelo is providing a service for a cost, you have to decide if its worth it"
Flight 718 Dec 15th 2022 took 27 hours to get from Orlando to New Haven Ct due to Malfunctions related to the aircraft. I slept in the airport. Then my return fight 719 Dec 28th 2022 New Haven was cancelled without any notice all monies refunded. I was told I couldn't get a flight out of New Haven until Dec 31st. After talking to an Agent I was told they refunded the Ticket because of the 27 hour delay in Orland that included my return trip was Cancelled and I was never notified of this. The Agent apologized and was sadden because she could not correct the Cancellation so I was stuck again! Last year 2021 the Christmas flight Orlando to New Haven Ct round trip went well. This year the Round trip delay is 4 plus days. All in all Avelo is providing a service for a cost, you have to decide if its worth it.

### "never recommend Avelo to anyone"
Worst experience ever. 3 hour delays to Orlando and back home. No communication explaining delay. Attendants at gates refuse to talk to you or go to tarmac. Overall the worst experience I’ve ever had flying. Will never recommend Avelo to anyone nor will I ever fly Avelo again. Abysmal.

### "think twice before ever flying Avelo"
3 h delay both coming and going and 1 1/2 h wait on the plane with some sort of mechanical difficulty (repairmen coming and gong) for that 1 1/2 h. Waiting areas packed and no place to sit. Weather was not a factor. I would think twice before ever flying Avelo.

### "crew was very nice and did their best"
Not Verified |  I had an amazing time traveling with Avelo, this was one of my first flight from Fort Myers to New Haven. The check in staff are extremely efficient, they check in every customer with a smile on their face. You can really tell they care about you and your travel experience. Sometimes customers are rude to them but they always handle it so professionally. The check in line was very long but but the staff made it move very quickly. I was at my gate in no time, the plane was running a bit behind schedule but nothing to complain about. The aircraft was clean and they even had music playing when we boarded! The crew was very nice and did their best to make everyone happy. Arrived to New Haven not too late and very happy to say my bags arrived too! New favorite airline!

### "still a Very bad experience"
Travelled to and from New Haven to Ft Myers on Avelo. Never again. A neighbor recommended them. New Haven is reasonably close. So we tried it. Big problems at New Haven airport. Not much parking and expensive. No real gates. You stand out in the cold for 10-15 minutes boarding the jet from the ground. The planes are fine, standard Boeing 737s. The airfare itself is relatively low cost. But the add ons are very high. $45 per carryon or checked bag each way. $180 for checked bags for 2 persons rt. Add $130 for seat assignment rt. You pay $27-$37 for a seat assignment. They also demanded I remove a standard Phillips electric toothbrush from my checked bag. Ridiculous. In 25 years of flying all over the world, only Avelo has forced me to remove a toothbrush from My checked bag! They said was fine to carry it onboard in my carryon bag. Go figure. Incompetence. The website is also very confusing. The site caused me to double book and double pay for my checked bags. I had to request a refund due to the confusion online when I checked in. All In all a very negative experience. They don’t even offer any water on their flights at all. 3 hour flight. Tweed new haven is definitely not ready for prime time. They have limited parking, no gates, not enough room for waiting passengers. A very bad experience. If you have elderly or wheel chair passenger, definitely do not fly with Avelo, or thru New Haven. They will freeze on the ground( tarmac boarding) or trying to board their flight. The price for a professionally run airline like American, JetBlue or Southwest is really not much higher (maybe even less!) and they fly out of real airports, like BDL, JFK, LaGuardia, and White Plains. No drink, no food, no WiFi. Nada. I tried them once, but I will not fly them again. The flights themselves were actual ok, the flight attendants also were friendly/ok, though they clearly have almost nothing to do in the air, no service, Flights just 1hour late, but still a Very bad experience. A Mistake.

### "Awful experience"
Awful experience. Little to no relevant communication. Cancelled a flight with no recourse. Absolutely no consideration for your time. You get what you pay for.

### "Absolutely awful experience"
Absolutely awful experience. My wife and I flew with Avelo for the first time and there was a “maintenance delay” that delayed the flight by 1 hour 30 minutes. Absolutely no communication updating us on the progress until more than 2 hours later. Cannot believe how annoying this was. Then they said it was delayed a further 1 hour 30 minutes. To add to the confusion, they sent out multiple misleading emails with typos and no helpful information and the information boards at the airport never updated. Totally ridiculous.

### "Horrible lack of communication"
Only reason why I gave 2 stars is because our flight to our destination was good. Our flight home was bad and Avelo  will not refund our flight even though we were told by an employee there they were refunding us. Let me give you the back story. We left MCO at 10:40am and we’re supposed to arrive to Tweed at 1pm. Around 1pm we started to land, it was very foggy, one second I saw the tops of houses close and the next second we shot back up in the air. The pilot was the only informative person on that plane. He let us know that they couldn’t see the runway due to fog and that we would circle around and try again in 10-15 min and that we had an hours worth of gas left so they were thinking about making an emergency landing at Bradley. After hearing back from air traffic control within those 45 min we stayed circling, they made the decision to emergency land at Bradley. We landed at 2:12. We sat on the tarmac for 15 minutes without being told anything until finally they said they were going to refuel and take off to Tweed again. HOW? How when the fog was still bad. That makes no sense. I would have loved to speak to a flight attendant about how I felt regarding this matter but there were nowhere to be found and the walkway was blocked by people standing or trying to use the bathroom. After an hour of them figuring it out with Bradley, Bradley gave us a gate and we were told we could exit the plane but we would need to stay close as they were going to reboard us and go back to Tweed. Absolutely not. Why again are we trying this when the weather was zero visibility of a very short runway?? So yet again the story changed and we were given 2 options. One was to: stay close and reboard and go back to Tweed or 2: go home and they would not release our luggage to us until the plane landed back at Tweed. With 3 children who had already had enough and were already scared there was no way I was doing option one. After getting off the plane, there was no one to speak to regarding how we will know when our plane would be back at Tweed because Bradley doesn’t serve Avelo so they couldn’t give us information which I completely understand but not one Avelo employee came off the plane to give us any information what so ever. Horrible lack of communication which left many people on that plane very upset, not only just us. And let me add that we had family picking us up so they were waiting at Tweed when I had to text them when we landed that they had to drive an hour to Bradley. So when we left, my husband immediately called Avelo and was on hold for 30 minutes before getting disconnected and then we tried again after that and we were on the phone for an hour and a half without anyone answering so at that point it was close to 9 o’clock and we gave up. We woke up this morning and called them around 10 o’clock and they let us know that our plane landed at 8:30 in the morning. It’s funny how nobody could call us to tell us that especially given all that we had just been through. So my husband spoke to the lady and explained all of this and explained that we should be given a refund for our flight due to the numerous issues that happened and the lady who he spoke to said she was putting the refund through we then drove 45 minutes to Avelo to retrieve our luggage. (Oh and the employee at MCO didn’t provide us with one luggage tag - thankfully that was not an issue).

### "I wouldn’t recommend this"
The flight from Newport News to Orlando on November 22 was a hour late. It took and hour to get claimed bags the belt was broke. On the way back to Newport News ticket was for 11/29/22 at 6:30 and I get to the airport MCO ,there were no workers at the desk at all. Apparently they changed the flight to the 27th with no warning at all ! Even online an receipts still show flight for 11/29/22. I really don’t mind cheap flights but this one is a big no no for me. I wouldn’t recommend this at all. Had me stuck in MCO.

### "Never flying Avelo again"
Not Verified |  Never flying Avelo again. Not only was our first flight delayed by an hour but our second flight out of Orlando was changed to two days in advance of my leaving. My family was never contacted that our flight had been changed. This very unacceptable and now we are stuck in Florida without anyway back home. Do not fly Avelo, spend the extra and fly expensive, it may be more expensive however you get better customer service and your flight won’t get changed by literal days. The customer service agent we talked to hung up on us multiple times and basically gave us no way home.

### "I will definitely fly with you again"
My experience with Avelo Airlines was one my family and I would never forget. We had a great time flying from Orlando to new haven. But coming back to Orlando my family and I were surprised when the flight attendant recognized my daughter for her upcoming birthday on November 28th. She had the passengers flicker their lights to congratulate her which was very special as this was our first time flying in years. I was one happy mama and proud as well. They also gave her the wings that the flight attendants wear and to top it off the captain himself came out and wished her a Happy Birthday. That was very kind of him and such class. I never got to take a picture with him and my daughter which was a bummer, I didn't want to hold up the line behind me. Thank you Avelo for such an amazing experience I will definitely fly with you again. Shout to Avelo Airlines Flight XP 721 and the Captain.

### "Absolutely avoid this airline"
Never flying with this airline ever again. My 10:30am flight was cancelled and rebooked to a 6:15pm flight. Without receiving any notification, email, text, or otherwise, the flight was delayed more and more until finally it got delayed to the next day at 11:30am. I was only aware of this flight delay because I luckily was tracking their flight status directly on their website. Thank goodness I did because my phone app and ticket on the browser did not update with the delays at all. I’m shocked at not only the lack of communication and basic technology but also that Avelo doesn’t reimburse you for anything. You only get reimbursement if you stay at a hotel. I luckily was able to get last minute accommodation with a friend, but unluckily that means I get no reimbursement whatsoever for saving them money by finding free accommodation all while having to deal with this back and forth. The ticket is crazy expensive for what it is ($45 for carry on too!) so was really expecting something better. Absolutely avoid this airline wherever possible. If prices at other airlines for last minute tickets hadn’t shot up, I’d 1000% be flying with another airline right now.

### "avoiding this airline in the future"
They changed the time on the flight from early morning to afternoon. When we arrived, the flight was delayed three different times, finally our plane we were supposed to fly on was ready, but we were informed our bags had been mistakenly sent to another state on a different plane. So we boarded the plane and sat for another 45 minutes before we were told the plane had another mechanical issue and we would have to deplane. We are now waiting for another to aircraft to come get us…. Supposedly the silver lining is that our bags are being sent back from Georgia to Connecticut and before we takeoff will be loaded onto this point. No matter how the story ends, I will be avoiding this airline in the future. While the staff is polite, they certainly are not very well, trained and this day has been a complete waste.

### "I'll never fly Avelo again"
I booked 2 round trip tickets for Thanksgiving months ago. The back in August 2022 I got a message from Avelo saying our return flight had been changed. I tried emailing their "customer support" several times but received no response. I tried calling several times but no one answers after waiting for hours. Today I went to print my boarding pass and learned our departure time had been changed, but never received an email or phone call but Avelo alerting me to the change. I then went to check on our return flight and now they no longer list any return flights that day ! Again no one answers when you call customer support. Will try to sort it out at the airport, but now have now confidence in this airline. How can they change flight times without informing the passengers? ! ! I'll never fly Avelo again.

### "very pleased with this airline"
Not Verified |  Flew on Tuesday before Thanksgiving. No problems at all. I have to admit I do not like that we not even offered a drink. So you need to make sure that you carry on a beverage of your choice and any snacks as there is nothing on the plane. The plane was not full so the stewardess offered people to move to another seat so they could stretch out. It was very expensive but I assume that it was because of Holiday travel. I would fly again, as very pleased with this airline

### "where is the customer service?"2
We were to fly from Burbank on Thursday 11/17 to Idaho on Avelo Airlines, as we arrived at Burbank, we received a text saying that our flight has been canceled due to maintenance problems, so far, I have called, emailed and have not heard anything from this company. We tried to book another flight while we were at the airport but to no avail, so the 5 of us returned home and are trying to recoup other monies that we paid for such as parking at the airport, renting car and most of all ruined a family function that we had planned for months. Also vacation times were used and lost time for work has occurred and no vacation. I will never ever use this airline ever! where is the customer service, there is none, I hope that I get reimbursed, and I won't lose my $1000 that I paid for. I will also erase this company name from any of my contacts.

### "it is completely meaningless"
Not Verified |  On November 11, 2022 I had (2) reservations to fly from Sarasota, FL to New Haven, CT. Upon arrival at the airport, there was not a single soul at the Avelo Check-in station. The tickets were booked on November 9, 2022. I tried to get e-mailed boarding passes immediately upon purchase on 11/9/2022. Avelo's preferred method of check-in through their website was not available on Wednesday 11/9/2022, Thursday 11/10/2022 or Friday 11/11/2022. Again, there was not a soul in site when we arrived at the Sarasota, FL (SRQ) airport at the Avelo desk at all for any help. We had been trying to check-in for three days with absolutely no luck. After waiting at their "customer lack of service desk" for a significant amount of time, we ran to the security check-in to see if we could get through using our IDs. Needless to say that was a joke. I waited on hold for a total of 1 Hour and 52 Minutes to be told that helping us find a flight out of an airport 3 hours South of us could be arranged for $700.00 more may or may not be an option. The CSR (that refused to give her CSR number) was downright rude and unhelpful, if not downright disrespectful. We are now not going to make it to our family reunion and are totally heartbroken. I wholeheartedly give this airline and their representatives an absolute ZERO for my review and will never recommend that anyone consider booking with them because it is completely meaningless. This is the first negative review that I have given in all of my 51 years.

### "No complaints. Super cheap"
Not Verified |  No complaints. Super cheap. Direct flight. No delays. As you should expect, ones to pay for checked bags. Absolutely going to fly them again. Old plane, but Newport News airport is easy and everyone was nice.

### "I’ll definitely fly again"
Not Verified |  I read reviews about this airline prior to boarding I seen a bunch of bad reviews but fortunately that was not my experience. We had no delays, seat was comfortable and staff was very nice and helpful. I really enjoyed Avelo as a first time flyer and glad they brought it to Lexington. I hope they bring some more locations for us to fly to other than Tampa soon, I’ll definitely fly again!

### "customer service is terrible"
Not Verified |  Avelo’s customer service is terrible. Hold times greater than an hour. Our plane had a technical issue, which can happen, but we were left in the dark relative to what was going on. Very poor communication. Our departure time was supposed to be 6:30 pm and we ended up leaving at 1:30 am. Apparently the needed plane repair parts were in New Haven so they flew a plane to Charleston with the parts and took us back to New Haven on the return flight. If that wasn’t the case I’m not sure what we would have done. The airport closed at 4:30 am. There was no guidance from Avelo. They need to do better!

### "I will be using Avelo again"
I flew Avelo round trip from BWI to HVN (Baltumore, MD to New Haven, CT). I had a completely normal, predictable trip that completely fulfilled my expectations. I read all the fine print. I knew I was on a discount, regional airline, and I did all the things to stay at the base rate. I safely flew in one hour each way at a sale rate rate $50–total. That is less than tolls and gas to drive the 5 hours, and I consider this option to see my kids a total blessing. All the employees I encountered on the ground and in the air were friendly and professional. I will be using Avelo again. I will be prepared, informed, and remember that air travel is a privilege.

### "I do not recommend this airline"
I have a flight booked for this Friday. Went through Avelo website to book my flight .. my itinerary says I paid 97$ for my one way flight 40$ for my carry on bag and 27$ for my seat. Total on my itinerary was 186$ when I booked it. After about an hour I logged onto my bank statement. It showed Avelo airlines took out 236$. 50$ more than what I originally thought I paid. After being on hold for 52 minutes inquiring about this charge the woman I finally spoke with after 52 minutes of being on hold proceeds to tell me that they decided to change my itinerary and charge me 50$ more after I booked my initial flight and the only way I found out was by checking my bank statement. So even though I was not informed nor booked for the price I thought I was initially paying. She told me if I wanted to keep the flight that the 236$ was final. I do not recommend this airline as they will take more of your money than what you think your initially paying. I'd give them zero stars if it were an option.

### "need to get better at communicating"
Not Verified |  We were delayed an hour but no mention of it at all. Not while we were waiting or no apology on the plane. Like it never happened. Now I’m dealing with the same thing on the way home. I wouldn’t have known unless I asked. No email or text or nothing. This is the fourth time I’m flying with Avelo and it has happened 50% if the time with no communication. It really sucks when someone is waiting to pick you up. They really need to get better at communicating. They ask for all your information, but for what?

### "pay extra for the carry on bag"
Not Verified |  So far I flied twice thru Avelo airline this year. I didn’t not have much other problems with this airline except their bag policy, I thought the airfare was pretty cheap when I made the reservation thru online but when I got to the airport to check in at the desk, the employee said I may have to pay extra for the carry on bag. Their policy said I can take the bag in the plane as long as the size of the bag is under their required size. I didn’t pay for the bag that time but he said I have to pay from next time.

### "Every time my flight pushed back by hours"
Every single time I have flown with this airline my flight has been pushed back by hours the week before. Sometimes multiple times the week before. And every single time it has been pushed back by hours once again two hours before the flight. It never fails, I always end up buying a ticket to have a day or at least half a day to spend with my family and lose that entire first day. Don’t save the money, spend more for a better airline. You will not get refunds for canceled tickets only travel points so if you buy a ticket and don’t like the drastic change you can’t fix it anyway. I kept trying this airline because it is a direct flight and saves two hours or so from connecting, might as well go with that anyway because the flight changes are so drastic you’ll lose more hours trying to fly direct than the “longer” flights anyway.

### "absolute worst customer service"
Not Verified | New Haven to Myrtle Beach. Avelo changed our flight, never notified us and I only found out because I couldn’t check into my flight. I called and waited almost 2 hours to connect to someone to be told our flight was moved to the day before and we weren’t sent an email - never got one. Checked every junk spam folder etc, nothing. So Avelo sends me a screen shot of the email confirmation with the departure and arrival date for that flight as the original date I had booked, not the one they changed it too! Over a month now and can barely talk to anyone - lost $1200 on an emergency flight home because Avelo couldn’t get us out for another 2 days I believe it was. Customer service has been a nightmare, hours on hold and just hanging up, giving up. Getting connected and transferred around and no one able to Help because it’s someone else’s issue who deals with it. Going on “hearing from a manager” for a week And a half Now, no reply to Email sent by me twice or call. Wrote again today, see what happens. The flight crew was an absolute gem, it’s too bad the rest ruined our time with Avelo. Maybe someone out there will Help me change our tune to Avelo, by out there I mean the airline actually trying to rectify the issue they created and are responsible for. I’ll even take that call from a manger I’ve been waiting a week and a half for. Update two weeks later the manager finally reached out and has been no help whatsoever claims there’s nothing wrong on their end and will not give me their information to help my email company. See if those emails ever came through their domain. The absolute worst customer service I have ever seen or dealt with. the worst part is there’s reviews online that same issue. I had pretty much to a T and when that was brought up, they stated “good to know we will look into it.” But according to me, they don’t make mistakes only us people having the same problem multiple times.

### "We were treated terribly"
Not Verified |  Do not take this airline! In response to your question, no it is not worth it. My plane was delayed 10 hours. There was no one at the desk to talk to. There was no information provided. We were told that if we left we would not get another flight because this one was not canceled. We were treated terribly.

### "Never fly these clowns"
Not Verified |  Never fly these clowns! Flight delayed no reason then last minute canceled? On hold for 4 hours then when connected hung up on. I do not care how inexpensive they are this is unacceptable. I will make it my mission to make sure people from New Haven never fly their airline!

### "customer service is the worst"
Avelo customer service is the worst. During a flight delay, I found an Avelo employee at the counter and was told she could not help me. I spent 2 hours on hold with customer service only to hang up because it timed out. Per a recording, I was offered to leave my phone number for a call back but that was full. When I finally got to the airport for my connecting flight there was no one at the counter and was told by security that customer service leaves within 10 minutes of the last flight and I’d have to use a service phone. I finally make it to the gate only to find out the wrong gate number was printed on my boarding pass. I missed the flight and the next flight out was 4 days away. I sent 2 emails a month ago and received an email today stating “they are working on it.

### "do not fly Avelo"
Not Verified |  Agree with other reviewer, worst experience ever flying. Flight was delayed for 4 hours … then cancelled last minute. Leaving us all stranded in Eugene. We were all told that another flight would not be available for another 2 days! Several other passengers had been canceled the 3 days previously … 3 times cancelled in a row!! 2 of these were young girls flying alone and were sobbing in the airport after hearing they were being cancelled for a 3rd time. No offer of help from the gate agent, he said he didn’t work for Avelo. Hundreds of additional $$$ spent on a hotel for that night (flight was cancelled at 8:00 pm) taxis and cost of 2 flights home the next day, we couldn't wait 2 days for a flight home as we have jobs, children, pets in boarding, and lives to get back to. Hours upon hours spent on the phone trying to reach “customer service” (what a joke!) to then be told by a surly agent that you have to email in a claim, not call it in. Have heard nothing in nearly 2 weeks after we went in our email claim, nothing. Called them again and asked for management, was told the manager’s name but he does not take phone calls. The moral of the story here is “you get what you pay for” do not fly Avelo. On the plus side, Avelo did distribute a generic email offering us $100 worth of travel credit towards a future flight with them.

### "you really aren’t saving much money"
Eugene to Burbank. This was without a doubt the worst airline experience I’ve ever had. Avelo cancelled our flight from Eugene, OR to Burbank, CA without any type of heads up. We found out when we got to the airport. They said the next flight out would be two days later, which was so frustrating because we all have lives and jobs to get to and not everyone can wait around an extra two days. We ended up spending an extra $500 for last minute tickets from Portland to Burbank via Southwest Airlines (which was a much better experience!! ), not to mention the $100 it cost to get a shuttle from Eugene to Portland (2 hours away). I have yet to get a refund from Avelo for this flight, and customer service is impossible to reach. Needless to say, I will never fly with Avelo again and advise that travelers look elsewhere. Avelo also claims to have lower prices, but once all the fees and additional things are added, you really aren’t saving much money.
