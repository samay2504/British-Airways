### "This airline is the worst for customer service"
Not Verified |  This airline is the worst for customer service. I have not flown this airline and after this headache of a process, I never will. It is very inefficient and it wastes time you do not have. In 4/2020 I was supposed to go to Manchester but COVID happened. Virgin did give me a credit which was great. Fast forward to 2022, I wanted to book a flight to Cancun and use my credit. They had no flights and I don't mean like full, I mean none going the week of 6/27 which I found insane and when you try and book online it only allowed you to book with points and not money. In any case, I wanted to get a refund for my ticket and you can't call and speak to anyone you have to fill out a form and wait 48 hours for someone to reach out to you. A  staff member finally text me. He was very nice and he processed my return. One day later, I realized that the card I originally used is cancelled. So I text back at that number and I got an automated message to fill out another form. So I go back and do that and now three days later I get an e-mail from customer service to tell me what happens to the money. So I had one more question for him. I e-mail back and you get another automated message to fill out the form and someone will get to you in 48 hours. I will never fly Virgin because this is disgusting and a lot of time and energy wasted. Once I get my money back, they will never waste my time again.

### "learn how to smile"
San Francisco to Indianapolis. I was on my last leg of journey home from New Zealand. I flew out with American, an then Fiji, Air New Zealand, Jetstar in New Zealand and they were all great. The staff on Virgin America need to fly with these airlines and learn how to smile, be friendly, and not look grouchy. A smile goes a long way.

### "plenty of space to stretch"
San Francisco to Indianopolis. Nearly empty flight, so there was plenty of space to stretch and move about. In-flight entertainment and food ordering was easy using the touchscreen. Food was decent; there was an accessible box of water bottles towards the back. I do wish they would clean the IFE remote and seatback pockets though.

### "the worst customer service"
Austin to Kahului via San Francisco. Virgin America has the worst customer service I have ever experienced. Our flight, booked months ago, was canceled approximately 48 hours in advance. All we received was an email. The links in the email directing you to get a refund or reschedule were broken. The flight status was not even available until about 24 hours in advance. My husband and I both called the recommended phone number and were put on hold for over 2 hours and then hung up on. The next day, we called back and were put in a queue. It took over three hours to get a call back. When we finally talked to a human being, we were re-routed to customer service and then hung up on. Flights have gone up in price since we booked, and they would not give us a refund that would cover the price of a new flight or book us on another flight the same day, which means we will lose money pre-paid on hotels and rental cars at our destination and have to pay out of pocket for the difference in a last-minute flight to get there. They just do not work with you at all or even try to understand your needs or respond to you in a timely manner. I will never be booking with Virgin again, and advise customers to beware — if your flight is cancelled due to the airline itself (where they should really step up to assist you), you may not even receive a full refund and may not reach your destination.

### "Horrible customer service!"
San Francisco to Nashville. Horrible customer service! Booked this flight months ago and upgraded to exit row at extra fee. 3 hours before flight my seats were given away. My party was disbursed throughout plane. Rude attendants. I have extreme anxiety and other health issues and those were not considered.

### "no lounge in SFO"
Newark to San Francisco. I am trying to return home on eve of a major storm. I usually fly UA but not satisfied with their service including 1st class so I thought give Virgin America a try. I am on a paid 1st Cl ticket and flight out ok. Food very good seat not lie flat but fine for length of flight. One complaint no lounge in SFO. I am at the moment trying to make a change to an earlier flight to avoid getting stuck by cancellation. The online link to modify it in is dead and have been on hold for 45”. The press one for call back option is also dead. I realize it is a mess for them with merger as well as storm warning in progress but one reason I fly 1st is for better service in this kind of service. And BTW no lounge in NY airports

### "saw no harm in moving up a row"
Chicago to Portland . Terrible customer service by the staff. I was sitting in 4D (aisle seat) on a relatively empty flight, the 3rd which is an upgrade row was completely empty so I saw no harm in moving up a row and making myself more comfortable. But the flight attendant approached me after the doors were closed and in the most obnoxious, loud and embarrassing way proceeded to inquisition me loudly about my assigned seat, and that this was an upgrade row that “I have to pay to sit in”. The row sat empty the entire flight and the flight attendant continued to be rude to me. Terrible customer experience.

### "I felt bullied on this flight"
San Francisco to Fort Lauderdale. I’m not sure what has happened to the art of humbly and kindly displaying hospitality in the air, but the crew aboard the Virgin America flight VX 1340 9:30 am on 3/10/2018 to Fort Lauderdale was extremely unprofessional and not eager to be courteous. Early on in our flight, the captain placed the seatbelt sign on due to turbulence. I needed to use the restroom as I glance back I saw a gentleman standing and waiting near where attendants were sitting in their quarters. They were laughing, giggling and flirting with the passenger as he stood and waited for the restroom to become available. When He went into the restroom, I stood up to wait exactly where he just stood, only to get a very rude toned request to sit while I wait. I asked why that gentlemen wasn’t addressed in the same manner to only have another rude response followed by the two employees speaking poorly of me as I entered the restroom. For the remainder of the flight, the stewardesses treated me very poorly and made me feel extremely uncomfortable with nasty stares. At one point I was watching a movie, and the head stewardess, not having any interaction with me prior, came over in an aggressive manner and waved her hand in front of my face, with no smile asked me if there is a problem here she should be aware of, when I said no, because I was not about to have any further aggressive and rude comments thrown my way, she asked again are you sure, I felt bullied on this flight. It is my hope that you will address this behavior for future passenger experience.

### "whole process was terrible"
Dallas to Los Angeles. The whole process was terrible I arrived at the airport a Hour early, waited in line until it finally became my turn to get my boarding pass and everything. Well the man helping me get checked in kept walking away from the computer to help other people and finally comes back to my counter and told me “you missed your check in time by 10 minutes” (10 minutes of my own time he spent not helping me get my boarding pass.) After explaining to him I had to be on that certain plane for a family emergency. He told me it wasn’t his problem and I should have been at the airport earlier if it was important to me. Flat out most disrespectful attendant I have ever dealt with but doesn’t end there. He got me another plane that brought me to San Fran airport then had to wait 3 hours to board another plane. And Recharged me a 35$ fee for layover when I already bought protection on my original tickets. When I tried to tell him I already paid for flight protection he walked off and got another attendant to help me. Then when I finally got on the plane all the flight attendants were  rude. I ordered a “free” beverage and it took over 45 min to get (no turbulence) Overall first and last time ever wasting my time with Virgin Airlines. Do yourself a favor and avoid their airline unless you like to be treated worthless!

### "will no longer recommend Virgin"
Flew Virgin America from Dallas to Los Angeles. Let’s start on how incredibly rude and unhelpful the agent at the gate was. When asked if she could help with arranging my seat to an aisle seat for the extra cost, she simply said that the aircraft was full, never even looking up at me. Then quickly starts talking to her coworker without letting me get in another word. Once on the plane, I noticed that their was several seats open. I knew that these were not no-shows as the last person who was called for the flight was standing right behind me when boarding. But the bad customer service doesn’t stop there. The flight attendants were even worse. My boyfriend had asked a flight attendant for an item and she responded with a shouting “hold on!” We didn’t understand why she had shouted it since we were simply asking for our order. It wasn’t as if she was helping anyone else at the time. She was currently helping us. The second flight attendant wasn’t any better. Just simply rude in her tone. Seemed as if she was bothered with anyone. To make matters worse my baggage got lost! Since I had a late flight there wasn’t any stores open by the time I left the airport. The baggage was returned within 24 hours however, I picked it up since it was a four hour delay in delivery. This experience was by far the worst I’ve had with any airline and I travel a lot for business. I will no longer recommend Virgin to anyone. American Airlines has just as nice planes with much better customer service. My 3 stars are for the plane, the entertainment and the one flight attendant who overly apologized for the two rude agents.

### "a gruelling experience"
San Francisco to Orlando. I could not believe an aircraft of this side that offers movie, music, games and TV entertainment did not have earbuds available for purchase. I sat in flight for 5.5 hours with basically nothing to do. What a gruelling experience. Although this is my first time flying with Virgin America, next time I hope my employer will make a better choice.

### "the flight was very good"
San Francisco to San Diego. Virgin seems not to have the super positive attitude that Alaska has. The passion and enthusiasm seems to be waning. The airline is nonetheless Leaps and Bounds better than United or American or even Southwest. The aircraft was clean and comfortable. The snacks and beverages were top-notch. The staff however seemed to be distant and indifferent. This is the opposite of Alaska where the staff is so passionate and helpful. The departure and arrival were prompt and punctual. All in all, the flight was very good. I just wish the staff seemed to be more connected and not so apathetic.

### "gate agent was incredibly nasty"
San Francisco to Dallas. Yesterday when I was checking in for my flight today, I decided to spring for the upgrade to the exit row. I was re-assigned seat 9D. I printed my boarding pass at home. At the gate, the agent took my boarding pass from me and handed me a different one. I didn't notice till I got on the plane that my seat had been switched to a non-exit row 7A. When I brought the discrepancy up to the flight attendant she said I had to go back to the gate agent to rectify the problem. It took a few minutes to swim upstream to get there and by that time the gate agent was coming down the gangway and he refused to help me and told me to take it up with customer service. When I went to the seat on my boarding pass 7A, there was a child sitting in the seat next to his mother who was in the middle seat. When I sat down in the aisle seat, the other passenger asked me to move to another row since there were other seats available. There were two open seats in Row 9 so I went to sit in one of those and the gate agent and flight attendant insisted I could not sit there even though I had paid for the exit row. The gate agent was incredibly nasty and threatened me that if I didn't go sit in the back of the plane he would throw me off the flight. At no time did they ask the woman who put her kid in my seat to either move or let me sit in the aisle seat. As I had an important meeting in Dallas, I did find an open seat in the back of the plane. The flight attendant was by this point thoroughly embarrassed and came back to apologize and brought me a glass of wine. She was great but I will never fly Virgin America again.

### "I don’t recommend"
Los Angeles to Orlando. Not really worth the money. The first time I flew with them from Orlando there was a 2.5 hour delay without advanced notice. They stated the reason that there was a lot traffic in LAX. I wish they could have let us know earlier, not when we were at the gate. The second time I flew back from LAX. My car seat was missing and then they delivered it to my home later in the week. However, the car seat was broken when we received it. I called them to locate the missing part so that we could fix it ourselves. People that spoke to were nice but they did not do anything to help me solve the issue but told me to call different departments. Finally I was told to call central baggage which is voicemail only department. Called and left voicemail twice but never got a call back. Our car seat is for our new first baby which is designed for use up to 2 years and we could only use it for 2 months. Another thing is that I wasn’t asking them to pay or compensate, I was just asking to help find and deliver the remaining part to us so we could put the car seat together and fix it ourselves but they never contacted us to give us an answer. The ticket was $350 round trip but our car seat-strolller system cost about the same. It’s even more costly to fly with virgin America. I don’t recommend this airline.

### "outrageously bad customer service"
Boston to San Francisco on Sunday morning, January 7, 2018. It was the worst situation and the worst customer service experience I have ever encountered. The water in the plane was frozen so our flight was delayed taking off. I was seated in the very last row of the airplane and when the repair crew was trying to defrost the water they kept the exterior door open. It was windy that morning and the outside temperature was around -6 below zero. I put on all the layers of clothing I had with me but was still completely frozen. I asked for a blanket or some sort of assistance and the flight attendant just kept saying no ma'am but the repair will be done soon. This went on for about 40-45 minutes with no resolution or even basic assistance. Every time the flight attendant walked by me visibly frozen, upset and uncomfortable he just kept repeating it will be warm soon. This is outrageously bad customer service and I recommend that no one ever make the mistake of flying Virgin America.

### "Virgin is not what it used to be"
Flew Los Angeles to Fort Lauderdale with Virgin America. Air quality in cabin on both flights was very uncomfortable, it was hot and circulation was poor. The crew were less than friendly at FLL checking in and there was only one person handling the massive travellers checking in for all three rows. Our seats were very uncomfortable. Virgin is not what it used to be.

### "Service was just excellent"
Seattle from San Francisco. Although there was no lounge available (Los Angeles has a lounge), the flight was better than the previous one. First Class gave us priority check-in, priority security check, priority boarding and they all saved time and came in useful. The seats were comfortable and this time, the flight attendants were extremely nice, friendly and approachable. Service was just excellent. They served food for the short 2h flight and it was delicious. Of course, a negative point of first class was the IFE being in the armrest which was inconvenient. However, the IFE was easy to use and very responsive. It also had sufficient content. Virgin America provides free messaging services and it worked well on my WhatsApp as I was able to stay in contact with my friends although it was a little slow.

### "attendants had bad attitude"
San Francisco to Newark. Virgin America used to be my preferred airline because they used to be very good with their service, even if their price sometimes is higher than others. But this time was different, flight attendants had bad attitude, took them forever to get some water, and I was forced to paid $50 for a worthless kennel by their staff (I never had problems with my original kennel before). That kennel could barely fit my dog, My poor dog (sized small) had to sat in that little piece of junk from San Francisco to Newark. The staff even said if I don’t get their kennel then I have to wait for their next flight. If I did not have to go to work the next day I would take it to their office to make it right. However, this will be my last business with Virgin America. So good luck to whoever flying with their pet by Virgin America.

### "has gone from bad to worse"
Palm Springs to San Francisco. The experience has gone from bad to worse and we haven’t even boarded the flight yet. Making the reservation ended up in my having to cancel what I had already booked because they wouldn’t let my small dog on that flight. So an agent in Denver assisted me in canceling that one and booking a new one. However he forgot to assign seats. When I discovered this error 2 days before the flight, I was told there were no free seats left and would have to pay $60 for premium seats. I should have fought it because it seemed like an agent error but I paid it. Then we got to the airport and paid another $100 for the bags. So for a short flight, we paid $160 just for seats and bags not including the actual flight which was around $475 including $100 for my dog. I kept getting flight status emails for the canceled flight, nothing on the new flight. Once we arrived at Palm Springs airport, the flight was to board at 4, take off at 4:42. At 4:15 and no plane at the gate, we asked the agent for an update. Then we were told there’s a mechanical problem, no plane will arrive until 5:30, take off around 6:10, an hour and a half past the scheduled time. When I expressed how horrible Virgin is, the agent agreed and said it will all be Alaska Airlines after April 2018. We finally left Palm Springs 3 hours after the scheduled flight at 7:20. Once in SF), we waited 30 mins for our bags. Worst experience in the US ever!! Oh and no free drinks, no apologies, the customer service was very sad.

### "trip was average"
Los Angeles to San Francisco. This trip was average, considering we had booked First Class. First Class did come in useful during check-in, security and boarding, where we were given priority. However on board, the service was like Economy Class. Other than having a wider seat and more legroom, the IFE was stowed away in the armrests and took ages for me to pull it out. We could not watch anything on it while taxiing, taking off, climbing or descending. The flight attendants were nice when talking to me, but did not smile.

### "nicer than Southwest"
San Diego to San Francisco. Virgin America was nicer than Southwest. Entertainment was fantastic, seat room wasn’t that great but the view of the pacific was beautiful. I would definitely fly them again. It was very easy to get tot the gate because it was so close to security. I got priority security & boarding for $15 extra. The flight was much cheaper (nonstop) than Southwest, so I only spent like $75. Alaska Air & Virgin America have merged so only have to use/earn mileage points on Mileage Plan (Alaska).

### "the most unprofessional group of employees"
After the last time I flew Virgin, I promised myself I wouldn't do it again but my travel companion convinced me otherwise so I gave Virgin another chance. Unfortunately, my trip back home was more unsatisfactory. Upon purchasing a small meal pack (I'm guessing the options were limited since it was only a 1.25 hour flight) and a cocktail, we were the last ones served (last seats on the plane). I feel as though delivering purchased products would be more of a priority. Perhaps assigning one person to deliver products while the other offers complimentary drinks would be more effective for customer service and efficiency. Maybe operationally that doesn't work for them because of cost but it compromises service. After receiving our order, the steward forgot an item and when I said excuse me and tried to tell her, she turned and said "you have to wait". I completely understand that but the way she said it was in a tone and look that I could only receive as annoyance. It was as if I was a nuisance to her. After reaching the back of the plane, I could hear loudly the other steward complaining and bad mouthing about a gentleman who wanted 2 diet cokes. I understand people talk shop but wow, in ear shot of other guests? We only received our purchases after the plane started to descend and before we knew it, we were forced to give up our purchased wine and cocktail. When my companion said "I didn't even get to finish. I'm going to get a refund. The steward retort with a "you do that". All I could think, and pardon the language, was "what the heck?". I have worked in customer service for over a decade, and this is by far the most unprofessional group of employees I have ever encountered. They were rude, unpleasant and just seemed so unhappy. Perhaps they are not suited for this kind of work but the airline needs to acknowledge that.

### "dysfunctional pre-paid bag drop"
San Francisco to Kahului. Long lines (should arrive 3 hours early), dysfunctional pre-paid bag drop (stood in line for over 30 min). Customer service by phone in regards to flight change was poor. Flight attendants were rude on a previous flight from SFO to LAS. Only good thing is the inflight movies for free.

### "Thank you Virgin America"
Flew Las Vegas to Austin via San Francisco in Main Cabin Select. A320 for both flights. Arrived at Las Vegas 2 hrs prior to departure and was advised SFO was experiencing ATC delays due to runway construction and would we mind leaving 1 hr earlier than planned, to ensure we made our connection to AUS. Thank you Virgin America, this worked out perfectly. Re ticketed in minutes, despite traveling on two different records. Given seats together in Main Cabin Select. Boarding was underway when we got to the gate, so we just walked right on board. We checked our bags, so no issue with lack of overhead space upon boarding. Left a few minutes late, then a 30 min ground hold, again due to SFO air traffic. Once in the air, choice of free food and beverages on this short 1 hr flight. Choose the protein snack with cheese and crackers and deli meats, which was excellent and would have not had a problem paying the $8 price tag, if we were in regular coach. I love the order online at our seat option. When the flight attendants get to your row, they simply hand you your choices. Very efficient. Landed 1 hr late in SFO, but still plenty of time for our connection. Spent 1.5 hrs in the Admirals Club, then a 3 hr flight to AUS, with again satisfying food options and beverages with a good choice of movies and shows to make the 3 hr flight time pass quickly. Would have liked to see a sandwich or salad offering on this sector, as the menu was the same as the short flight to SFO. Arrived on time, our bags were the 2nd ones off due to Priority Tags due to our status. Over all still a great airline that will be missed. If I have a complaint with Virgin America, its the size of the First Class cabin, making it hard to buy FC on short notice trips. If you have to go economy, Virgin America is a good choice though.

### "no pilots available"
Flew Virgin America from San Francisco to Austin. 3.5 hours late because no pilots available and all we got was a $15 voucher good for today only. Pathetic. I used to think Virgin was better than the rest but not anymore. United at least gives you a $100 voucher to use on another flight good for a year when they are this late.

### "event feels like a scam"
San Francisco to Boston. I changed a connecting flight from Seattle to San Francisco so Alaska cancelled my San Francisco to Boston leg. When I went to check in, I was told my ticket was cancelled and to get back on the same flight I would have to pay a $125 change fee and $328 for a fare difference - for the same flight they cancelled and didnt notify me of. Then, my seat assignment gets unassigned in the hour and a half between repurchasing my ticket amd getting to the airport. Now, I have to wait until 30 minutes before departure, lose any overhead space for my carryon and hope I have a seat. While im sure I'll be told there is some rule that allows the airline to do this, the entire event feels like a scam.

### "bad attitude by gate agent"
Los Angeles to Seattle. Really poor service and bad attitude by gate agent. Unnecessarily gave me a hard time despite being first class. Unfriendly staff attendants that kept complaining about becoming part of Alaska and how different the culture between the two airlines is. Lounge was cramped and hardly had any good food.

### "Unnecessary stress"
New York JFK to Los Angeles. I was told more than an hour and 20 min ago this morning that I could not board my flight - which I had already checked into online, by a woman representing the airline who then claimed she was a supervisor, when I asked to speak to one. After driving home my point that this was completely unacceptable and wasting valuable time, she allowed me to speak to the woman at checkout, 10 ft away, who said there was no problem at all, showed me how to call up my boarding pass on screen of my phone. Flight was not to leave for another 40 min, 11:30 AM, yet first woman sought to unnecessarily block me and delay me. At 12:23pm now, I'm still sitting on that plane, that she argued I couldn't board, waiting for it to pull away. Unnecessary stress.

### "care about sitting next to my wife"
Los Angeles to Washington Dulles. This flight was in September and I purchased the tickets in May. It was part of a honeymoon trip for my newly wed wife and I. The other 3 flights previous to this one ( different carriers all booked at the same time) were wonderful. As I selected to sit with my wife on each flight, once aboard this flight we were seated on completely opposite sides of the plane. I could care less about food/drink service, flight amenities, or any other part of the flight, but I care about is that I'm sitting next to my wife. Now I'm on a coast to coast flight sitting on opposite sides of the plane.

### "not very service oriented"
Austin to San Francisco. The flight from to SFO was uneventful and I had a pretty good experience. The return flight not so much. In the end, the flight was 2.5 hours late into Austin. There was no issue with weather; it is still unclear why we had such a delay. Virgin did a very poor job of explaining it and really provided no information about the delay until after our flight was to have departed. Once we pushed back from the gate, it took about 1 hour before we took off. Then, about 20 minutes after take-off, some people started to get up to use the rest room. They were quickly scolded since the fasten seat belt sign was still on. Once the pilot finally turned off the sign, about a dozen people jumped out of their seats and formed a long line for the restrooms at the back of the plane. I waited a while, and once the rest room in the front was unoccupied for a couple of minutes, I went up and used it. I was in row 5, so very near the front. As I returned to my seat, the flight attended reminded me that the rest room in the front was for first class. I said I understood that but there was a long line in the back and they had already had us on the plane for a couple of hours, so I had to do what I had to do. She scolded me some more and made me promise that I would not use the first class restroom for the remainder of the flight. Then another person from row 4 went to use the front rest room. She refused to let him and insisted that he join the long line in the back. On other flights, we have been told that it is also against the rules to form a long line for the rest rooms. When the crew came through for drinks, they gave mostly ice and only about 2/3 of a cup of soda. I felt that the flight crew was rude and not very understanding given the situation that they created for their customers, and not very service oriented. The entertainment system was good and the seats were not bad relative to other airlines.

### "just isn't worth it anymore"
Los Angeles to New York JFK. Having flown Virgin about 6 times in the last 2 months I've been very pleased. The purple light in the plane is relaxing and the hostesses are always great. I love the Loft lounge before flights- it makes traveling much more enjoyable. It is $30 extra, but definitely worth it. Either purchase it online or get there early to be able to join it. Tonight I was flying from LAX to JFK at 11:05. Virgin has a policy that you must get to check in 40 mins before if you are checking a bag. I knew this policy which is why when I was in the LAX car pool I tried calling them multiple times because I was at gate 1 and the traffic was moving slowly. I decided to go check in myself and pay my uber driver to meet me there with my bags. I make it to the counter 2-3 mins after the cut off. The agent said curtly that she could not help me because I was late. I said how I tried to call multiple times, but no one answered. I asked what my options were (take off is still 35 mins away) and she said she coult try to put me on Standby for 7am. I asked what I was supposed to do for the next 8 hours and she said to sit on the bench or to get a hotel. I said I would be fine hanging in the Loft till then and I would gladly pay the upcharge because I did not book it for my late flight. She said the lounge was not open when I wanted since Alaska Airlines bought Virgin. I did not know anything about this. Virgin is more expensive to fly to the East coast, and I never had a problem paying extra because it was better. But since Alaska took over, it just isn't worth it anymore because it really is not better than any airline.

### "I was pleasantly surprised"
Washington to Los Angeles. I was pleasantly surprised by the entire flying experience on Virgin America. Comfy seats, free entertainment that's easy to access, tasty food for purchase, very nice staff, on-time boarding and takeoff - so much better than my experiences on United Airlines.

### "weren't given seats together"
New York to Las Vegas. Me and my husband weren't given our seats together, we got our seats on the last row, and the crew was so noisy. Seats were very uncomfortable and on top of that crew was laughing and talking on top of their voice.

### "cannot recommend Alaska or Virgin"
I purchased a round trip ticket on Alaska Airlines for a flight operated by Virgin America. Three hours before my Sunday evening return flight from Portland was to depart for San Francisco (3:15 p.m. and my flight was scheduled for 6:20 p.m.), I received three text messages from Alaska Airlines letting me know the flight is canceled and I have been rebooked on a 5 a.m. flight from Portland to San Francisco via Los Angeles arriving in San Francisco at 11:40 a.m. the next day, a Monday. There was no explanation given for the flight cancellation. The text message included a toll-free number that did not work when I called it. It said I had a message waiting for me, but when I pressed "1" for my message, it said I had no messages. It was a fully automated line and pressing "0" did not connect me to an operator, it only repeated the cycle that said I had a message and then said I did not have a message waiting for me. I had to buy a $199 one-way ticket on Southwest that got me back to San Francisco at 12:30 a.m. Sunday. I had a meeting Monday morning at work that I could not miss and Alaska provided no options for rebooking on other flights that would get me back on Sunday night. This is very poor customer service and I cannot recommend Alaska or Virgin to anyone.

### "scuffed and damaged suitcase"
Orlando to Los Angeles. The service started out fine, in fact most of it was exceptional excluding a few delays in getting to my gate in time. I do have a few minor problems with how my flight went and the care given to my luggage though. The smallest detail that got on my nerves was the fact that everything had to be paid by card, so if you're on a six hour flight with cash, make sure you eat before. They did give complimentary drinks once during the flight but that's all. Another little bug is that they had a very small selection of pretty much everything, entertainment-wise and food-wise. Again, these are just small tweaks that made my flight the tiniest bit worse, but the most important thing I mentioned was the care given to my luggage. Arriving at baggage claim, I found my suitcase scuffed and covered in black ink spots. The person I was traveling with also recieved a very scuffed and damaged suitcase, although older and not as costly.

### "met with such incredible rudeness"
I am sitting on the aircraft right now about to take off from Los Angeles to Newark. It's a real shame because I had such a good experience flying from JFK to LAX, but I have to write a bad review because I was met with such incredible rudeness by one of he stewardesses. I politely asked if I might be able to switch seats to a window seat (the entire row was empty). Instead of politely telling me she had to wait till we took off she aggressively, and extremely rudely commanded two times in a row that I sat down at my assigned seat. I really think it's a shame because Virgin America is generally great, but this specific stewardess should not work in the service industry.

### "a great airline to fly"
San Francisco to Los Cabos. Virgin America has always been a good airline and this flight was nice and easy! They have tons of entertainment on their screen! Wifi is very expensive at $16. A couple of our family members had trouble with the remotes not fully working, but overall a great airline to fly!

### "the crew looks tired"
Los Angeles to San Francisco was due to depart at 1945 from LAX. The incoming flight from Dallas was delayed arriving at 1910. However we could not board until 2010 as the crew from another flight has yet to arrive. They only arrive at 2010 and we finally boarded between from 2015  with a final departure time of 2045. Luckily my connecting flight was at 0100. The crew was obviously very exhausted. This combination with frustrated passengers who had to wait is not ideal. I have flown Virgin Australia and Virgin Atlantic and have to say that Virgin America lacked the level of customer service I am used to. Again it was nothing major but the crew looks tired and wanted to get the job done quickly.

### "it was a very good experience"
Kahului to Newark via San Francisco. My flight with Virgin America was very good! It was originally supposed to leave Kahului at 1:10 p.m (January 1) but it was changed to 11:10 p.m (January 1) a few months in advance. It was good that I was made aware of this a good few months before by trip. This meant I got to spend a couple extra hours in Kahului before heading back home to Newark. The flight to SFO was very good, the captain was funny and made a few jokes and the flight attendants were friendly. We were able to make it to SFO in about 4 hours and 15 minutes instead of the scheduled 5 hours. This meant I could enjoy a nice breakfast at the airport before my second leg. The flight from SFO to EWR was just as good. There was a wide selection of drinks and snacks as well as movies. However, the movies did have to be paid for but I didn't much mind as I had my kindle and 3DS. Cabin crew was also friendly. We did have to enter a hold when approaching Newark as their was bad weather and congestion in the air. But, this was to be expected (after all this is Newark and it happens all the time). We touched down at 5-ish in the afternoon on January 2. Overall, it was a very good experience.

### "my experience wasn't the best"
Very unhappy about my overall experience. I flew to and from Seattle to San Francisco and back both in First Class on Virgin America. The staff on the way down to San Francisco was not very attentive. Didn't come around much to check for drinks or food. Then on my way back home, my seat was broken. The lumbar section kept inflating and deflating the whole flight. My headphone port to watch a movie was not working properly. It would not get loud enough for me to hear the movie. So needless to say my experience wasn't the best.

### "they know delay 24 hours ahead?"
New York to San Francisco. They sold my booked seat to other booked seat three months ahead. Their website showed my flight on second day was cancelled because of a storm. According to weather broadcast, second day would be a sunny day and the morning flights were on time. It was weird. I had to spend 5 hours to call and re-booked my seat in New jersey in other day. The most ironic part is that their website showed actual take-off time and landing time for that "cancelled" flight a day later. It was not cancelled. Most likely they sold my seat to other passenger. I found it could cost 3-5 times more in that day when I searched alternative. Because of the cancellation, I missed my school and three appointments. Virgin America explanation was cancellation due to delay in the airport. How can they know delay 24 hours ahead to cancel the flight?

### "ground staff was unpleasant"
First return flight with Virgin America from New York JFK to San Francisco. Announced delay of 1:30hrs due the weather but the weather at SFO is 10mph wind with rain and other flights are taking off to there. When I gently asked the ground staff what's the issue and to tell me about the weather impact on our flight schedule she was unpleasant not willing to talk about the topic. This gives me the feeling that this company is not honest with passengers.

### "very disappointed customer"
San Francisco to Denver. Very disappointed customer. I've been a huge champion of the Virgin American brand up to this point. My entire experience checking into this flight was miserable. It started when I tried to check into my flight online but wasn't able to. After an hour long chat with customer service I was told that there was nothing they could do for me and that I could check in at the airport, no problem. So I get to the airport 2 hours early and proceed to self check in. I enter my confirmation code and the screen tells me that there is no matching customer reservation. So I call Virgin customer service and they are no help. They tell me to go to the Alaska terminal because that is where my flight was originally booked. So I start the process to head to the international terminal. I'm freaking out at this point that I may miss the flight. I decide to call Alaska customer service before making the trek to the other terminal. The customer service for Alaska was very helpful and the one saving grace of this experience. They told me to go back to the Virgin terminal and try the self check in again. Still no luck. Then they tell me to find a Rep. The Rep who was manning the lines was terrible and unfriendly. She told me I needed to wait in the full check-in line. The line took 40 minutes and it was only 15 people long. Finally I get to the counter and the rep prints my boarding pass no problem. 2 hours later and I'm just making it into the flight. What a terrible experience! Virgin and Alaska need to figure this merger out asap. This is terrible.

### "gave me a bit of angst"
First time flight on Virgin America, from Fort Lauderdale to Los Angeles. Buckled up, waiting on tarmac and the pilot announces there is not enough fuel to reach our nonstop destination (Los Angeles) due to the expectation of strong headwinds; he states we will probably have to stop in Las Vegas for refueling. I never heard this type of announcement before and it was kind of creepy. If amount of fuel was a concern, why couldn't that have been addressed while at Fort Lauderdale prior to take-off. Though I am an Alaska Airlines fan and knowing that they just purchased Virgin America, not sure if I will fly Virgin America again. It ended up we were able to bypass Las Vegas with pilot announcing our fuel safety margin was OK and we went on to LAX. Still, I think that creepy announcement gave me a bit of angst during the flight that I could have done without!

### "done nothing to earn my patronage"
Boston to San Francisco. I've lived in northern CA for two years now but am originally from MA, so whenever I go home I get a redeye from SFO and a day time return trip. My flight from SFO has never had a problem - we leave on time and the plane is usually some what empty. That said, I have never gotten out of Boston with out a problem. The last time I took this flight they forgot to load water on to the plane and during the time they took to load water an ice storm came and they left us sitting on the tarmac for hours. Today we were delayed, but there was nothing indicating why, or even that we were delayed period. When I tried to change my ticket the captain came out to announce that the flight would take off, and even though we were now going to arrive in SFO after all public transit was closed and the bus I was scheduled to take to Sonoma county will be gone. I couldn't change my ticket without incurring a 150 dollar charge. While the staff was apologetic they were incredibly unhelpful, one member literally had a tantrum while I was talking to her partner. Virgin has done nothing to earn my patronage and I suspect they will do little to earn yours.

### "complete lack of information"
Flew from San Francisco to Boston. I use to love Virgin but now two flights in a row I have sat on the tarmac while they fixed an issue with the plane. Twice now with well over an hour delay in a row for an airline I use to consider reliable. The worst part was the complete lack of information. The employees ran for whatever hidden cover they could to avoid questions. The captain came on just to give a 15min update of we aren't moving yet and they are working on it because in his words, "he was required to by law" as if the law wasn't there he wouldn't care. The lack of communication is dumbfounding for an airline who use to pride themselves on customer service and quality. The least they could do is give us a free movie for the delay but they didn't last flight that had a 2 hr delay and I have no faith this one will either if we ever get off the ground that is. Should have stuck with Southwest. They are bare bones but at least they seem to care.

### "they accepted no responsibility"
The flight San Francisco to Los Angeles was delayed while we waited for crew to turn up for work for nearly an hour. This cost me my connecting flight. They accepted no responsibility as my connecting flight was not booked through Virgin America, but Virgin Australia. I then had to pay for another ticket to continue my journey back to Australia. The staff member was smug and and would offer no assistance to my predicament. When I arrived at LAX, Virgin America had then lost my luggage. After waiting around I finally hurried a lost luggage report that took so long I was in jeopardy of missing my newly booked flight. I had to argue with the attendant as he would not accept the fact that my phone number was an overseas number. He was adamant that I needed to provide an American phone number(? ), which of course I could not provide, as I live in Australia. We agreed on my email address. After arriving back in Australia I did receive an email saying that they had found my luggage and it was ready to be picked up.I replied that this was impossible and how was I to get the luggage and would it be couriered to my house. Their reply was that it was "a courtesy" that they would place it on a plane back to Australia, giving me a ticket and flight number.

### "crew seemed on edge"
New York JFK to San Francisco. We boarded on time and after seated were told that strong headwinds meant the plane did not have enough fuel to fly direct to San Francisco, so we have to fly to Salt Lake City instead. Then we spent about an hour on the ground before departing for Salt Lake City. Inflight food ordering system showed limited availability of snacks and no special cocktails. I have not flown Virgin America for years so not sure how long ago they discontinued that gimmick. Cabin crew seemed on edge. Flight landed at Salt Lake City, refueled, waited, then departed for SFO and arrived more than 2 hours late - at 12:30 am. Cabin crew distributed what was left of beverages on second leg of flight. Passengers were worn out and irritated. No offer was provided. Aircraft on this route and leg from SFO-JFK were worn out and no longer look modern.

### "very bad customer experience"
San Francisco to Boston. I am not reviewing Virgin America's flight or aircraft, I am reviewing the customer service leading up to my flight. I have called 6 times to try and find someone on the other end of the line that could help me. I am now on my 6th call and have been on hold 45 minutes! I recently saw Richard Branson speak at LinkedIn's Talent Connect and I thought, "I am going to book my next flight on Virgin America! what a mess. Richard, there are a ton of people out there that want to give 150% to their employers, and 5 of the 6 individuals that I spoke to representing your airline have been rude, unhelpful and left a very bad customer experience with me.

### "3 hour delay still is not acceptable"
Flew from New York to San Francisco. 3 hour delay without a proper heads up. It's clear that Virgin America lacks adequate gate access and packs way too many airplanes to the few gates they have which causes significant delays. Staff are decently trained but 3 hour delay still is not acceptable.

### "a disappointing experience"
Flew Virgin America from Los Angeles to Sydney. I have to say I was extremely disappointed with the food on both flights especially breakfast and yes I know we only flew economy class but the breakfast focaccia was so tough, we would have been better off eating the box it came in. The noise the cabin crew made on our flight home made it hard to sleep, they weren't helping customers they were just sitting talking amongst themselves about what they'd been up to in the last few days. Our seats were at the back of the plane, picked on purpose and never before have I had to ask the staff to please quieten down so we could sleep. All in all a disappointing experience.

### "offer me no refund or hotel"
Kahului to Chicago via San Francisco. This is by far the worst experience. The plane was suppose to depart at 10PM. It was then canceled and moved up by 10 hours for the flight to depart 8AM! When I called the Virgin America Customer Service, they did not have a record of the flight being canceled. After dreadfully waiting in line, the receptionist told me there was a lack of staff. I then called the customer service staff and, they told me the staff cannot work over a certain period of time. Delta had food for the clients as well, but not Virgin. Virgin would offer me no refund or hotel room because of their lack of staff. Lots of people were sleeping at the airport.

### "really upset about my experience"
Las Vegas to San Francisco. I am really upset about my experience with virgin America. I had a layover in Las Vegas and my first flight was delayed so I only had 35 minutes in between flights. I ran to my Virgin America flight and go there 25 min before the flight departed to be told that they gave away my ticket because I wasn't checked in 30 minutes ahead of time. I tried to ask what was going to happen and she just told me to sit down and wait because she needed to get the plane going. She then called people on standby before me even though I actually had a reservation. I missed my flight and don't know when they are going to put me on - never flying with them again.

### "a pleasant flight"
Flew Virgin America  from New York to San Francisco. From the service at the counter to the flight itself though tired from flying JHB to JFK (international 15hrs), this was a pleasant flight, smooth, clean, elegant and very kind crew. I'm wondering why I haven't used Virgin before now. I was impressed.

### "would definitely fly again"
San Diego to Boston via San Francisco with Virgin America. Found an absolutely miraculous deal on this flight. It was a through flight so I didn't have to change planes in SFO. We just got off, grabbed some food and got back on. Even with parents of a toddler next to me, I was comfortable in my seat and due to the live TV stream and the time of this year, almost everyone was watching the Olympics which was kind of fun. The staff was attentive and brought any drinks I ordered almost immediately. I didn't buy any food but the people next to me did twice (it's a long flight and they had a toddler). Both times, it was easy for them and their food came quite quickly. Would definitely fly again.

### "was cramped and uncomfortable"
I have enjoyed previous Virgin America flights and was looking forward to flying them from Seattle to Los Angeles. The plane was cramped and uncomfortable, and my seat didn't recline. No snacks on a 3 hour flight and 1 tiny cup of lukewarm coffee. Then a 20 min wait on the runway as our arrival gate was not available.

### "level of foresight was excellent"
Customer service to the max! On my return from a weekend in Las Vegas, I was exhausted and not that thrilled to be connecting red eye through LA to Boston, but so be it. So I was very pleasantly surprised when Virgin called me up to the gate to inform me that my flight was just delayed and I would miss my connection. So they had rebooked me on a JetBlue nonstop arriving earlier than my scheduled flight! The level of foresight was excellent, I hadn't even learned of the delay issue before they fixed it. And I got an exit row to boot. So my new favorite airline, Virgin America, is one I've still never flown! (Contrast this with my flight out to Vegas on American Airlines, which refused to let me fly standby to avoid a delayed flight, despite having plenty of open seats, because I didn't have 'status'. Thanks, American, for making me feel like a second class citizen even though your flight delay was causing my inconvenience.) I'll look to book with Virgin on my next flight, and hope to actually fly with them!

### "seats are very comfortable"
A few months ago I traveled Virgin America premium economy and the service was terrible, I thought it was because I wasn't in first class. On my recent trip from Los Angeles to New York JFK I purchased first class tickets. The service was still very poor. I fell asleep and when I woke up later they did not offer anything to drink or eat. The seats are very comfortable though.

### "the worst customer service"
San Francisco to Las Vegas, and Virgin America has given me the worst customer service experience I have had with any airline. You would think that making seat assignments is such a small task in the airline business, but when you deal with Virgin America, they will leave you convinced that this is a very hard thing to do! First of all, when I booked my flights, their system didn't allow me to make seat assignments because "it was too early". I tried again one week before my flight but almost all of their seats were grayed out. I called them to make the seat assignments and waited about 20 minutes to talk to a rep. While waiting, the recorded message cautioned me that I am going to have to pay $20 for using the phone service. Then the rep verbally assigned me seats that were never reflected on their website. I called again to confirm and they said "it takes time for the seats to show". I went to the airport to find that those seats are not mine and was given seats in the very last row next to the bathrooms! On the way back, similar screw up has unfolded. Called to make my seat assignments and found myself going through the same hassle. The rep lacked integrity and kept changing his story to force me accept seats in the last row again. Then when I asked him to just not make any assignments at the time, he still went ahead and assigned those seats anyways.

### "the worst customer service"
This was by far the worst customer service I have ever experienced. Virgin America cancelled my flight due to crew issues and did not provide a new itinerary. Rather they sent an email asking me to rebook my flight within two months so as not to incur fees. I proceeded to call them and spent four hours on the phone to get on a new flight. They confirmed me on several flights, I raced from terminal to terminal (mind you I'm pregnant) but because the supervisor took so long to confirm each flight I missed three flights in a row. I could have accomplished what they were trying to do (rebooking me through a flight on Kayak) in 5 minutes. Because they did end up rebooking me on a flight (which instead of being direct, flew through Boston and added 4 hours to my trip) they are not giving me a reimbursement, even though the supervisor on the phone promised to do so. I have never been more disappointed in customer service and will not be travelling with them again.

### "I would fly them again"
New York JFK to Las Vegas with Virgin America. I originally booked a Main Cabin Select seat for some added comforts to start my trip to Vegas nice and relaxed. Since I had an early morning flight(and I go to sleep late) I decided to check-in 6hrs prior to try to get an upgrade to 1st Class. I got lucky and got the last seat (2A). Checked in at the desk inside with nice agents. Priority boarding was nice. I had time to put stuff away and settle in before the rush of the remaining passengers. I had a drink prior to take off offered by professional and friendly staff. A great seat - I asked what the buttons were for on the armrest and it was for the seat massager. I used that all the way to Vegas (it put me to sleep pretty good twice). The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the food. I don't know why they had to get "super fancy" with it. Some normal generic stuff would've been fine for me  and others I noticed (too much fluff added to the food that turned me off). I got to Vegas totally relaxed and geared up to get my vacation started. I would fly them again.

### "service was really great"
What a contrast to American Airlines. I flew Virgin America on an early morning flight from Las Vegas to San Francisco. The aircraft was clean and well presented, the crew were happy to be there and the service was really great. I was dreading this flight as it was in economy, but the crew were so good and the whole experience so very much better that the American Airlines flights I took (in First Class). Clearly not all American carriers are the same. Well done Virgin America.

### "a great flight to remember"
La Guardia to Dallas Love Field. This was our first time flying on Virgin America. From the time we arrived at the gate until we got off the aircraft was a wonderful experience. The gate staff were very friendly and helpful. The cabin interior was amazing and the lighting gave a nice ambiance. The seats were cozy (even though we could not recline the seats due to being in front of the overwing hatches). Inflight entertainment was great, with plenty of viewing choices. The interior of the aircraft was very clean and well kept. Food choices were excellent and the staff treated us very nicel!! Kudos to all at Virgin America - you made this a great flight to remember!

### "staff very unhelpful"
Staff very unhelpful. Our flight was cancelled in san Francisco and the staff said nothing. We got off the plane and the young lady at the desk said if we were not first class we had to go out front and reschedule. Once we got out front we stood in line over a hour and the lady at that desk was unfriendly and gave us attitude from hell. I understand that it wasn't her fault but this airline has no communication skills whatsoever! At least keep the people in the loop. I am thankful and gracious for the meal they provided, but I would have preferred to be home a day earlier like I booked.

### "a great lower cost option"
Virgin America was a great airline to fly. The crew was helpful, the plane was clean and the seats were pretty comfortable for the 3 or so hour flight to Orlando. I really liked the plane, the interior decor was great and I really like how you can order food from your seat, and drinks are free! Just a great lower cost option to fly!

### "the best US domestic carrier"
I've flown with Virgin America many times and it is easily the best US domestic carrier. The planes are new, clean, and comfortable. Staff are friendly and quick to help. Inflight entertainment is top-notch, and ordering and paying for food and drink from your seat is like a dream. If I had to choose a downside, it would be limited routes and time tables. I wish there were more flight times to choose from, particularly from Portland to San Francisco.

### "overall performance was great"
Flying first time with Virgin America LaGuardia to Dallas - experienced a 1 hour delay due to delayed departure from Dallas. The ground staff were very attentive and responsible on handling passengers while waiting for the plane to arrive. During the entire flight, the cabin crew were polite and nice and they were quite good at dealing with the kids onboard. Despite the slight delay and Dallas Love Field Airport location was not as expected, the overall performance was great.

### "barely provided any details"
Palm Springs to Boston via San Francisco. On the way to Palm Springs Virgin didn't feed us for 7 hours. Nuts and chips were $6. Movies were super expensive but these are just minor gripes. On the way back we were flying to Boston with a stop in San Francisco. Our flight to SFO was delayed so we would be arriving at around 11 with our second flight taking off at 11:10. Everyone was very stressed and Virgin America did not provide much info. We took off about a half an hour later then expected and when we finally arrived at San Francisco, we were stuck at the tarmac for 20 mins. That is obviously not their fault but the staff barely provided any details and they only told us that our plane was waiting, neglecting to tell us what gate it was, and later on, when it left. They clearly didn't want to have to deal with the angry 12 people on the plane who wouldn't by getting to Boston.

### "appreciate your help"
Virgin America customer service at Las Vegas check in counter is excellent. My husband and I tried to check in for returning to New York, not realizing our flight was a day ahead! A lady there kept the situation so cool and accommodate to rebook the flight for that day. On top of it, she somehow managed to cut our cost to zero. I have been traveling for many years yet, I have never experienced such curtesy and professional serives from any of the airlines. The Virgin America staff made us feel so safe and made her ways to clean up our mess. Virgin America - we really appreciate your help! !

### "a very good airline"
San Francisco to Los Angeles, this was an excellent flight on a very good airline. I like Virgin America with their modern, simplistic approach with a focus on the things that matter and not others which cost money. The plane was modern, clean and streamlined with intimate lighting for an early evening flight from SFO to LAX. The service was friendly appreciating that at this time most of the passengers just want to relax. I was very impressed with Virgin America and will fly with them again.

### "great customer service"
Great customer service. I flew on an almost full Virgin America flight from La Guardia to Dallas Ft Worth. The flight crew was very friendly and captain was communicative throughout. The Red entertainment system is usually great, but mine malfunctioned about 1 hour into the flight. The crew attempted to reset the system but it continued to malfunction. I was offered a seat change, but declined since it would have been a middle seat instead of my aisle. The lead crewmember cancelled my Red charges and upon landing, Virgin sent an email with Travel Bank for an upgrade on my next flight. I spoke with customer service about changing my seat on another flight and it was very easy to move. It is always so nice to talk to a friendly person on the phone who is equipped to solve problems.

### "airline unwilling to help"
Flew Virgin America in August 2015 from Las Vegas to New York via San Francisco. Virgin America changed flight at Vegas. Was assured that luggage would follow. It did not. It still has not been found. Filed claim for lost luggage. Items were paid for with cash and not keep receipts. Airline unwilling to help. Customer service tried to be helpful at the beginning, but once the case was escalated they became unresponsive and unprofessional. They are the ones who are punishing me even though I did nothing wrong. I trusted they would not lose the luggage.

### "have the best service"
Thank you Virgin America agents for everything and for your amazing service. My mom and dad who don't speak English at all were in a terrible situation of possibility to miss their connecting flight to Moscow if not for the Virgin America agents who helped them to collect their luggage and guide them through terminals! SFO to9 LAX Virgin America flight was delayed due to some mechanical problems and arrived at LAX 3 hours later than it was supposed to be. So they arrived at LAX an hour before their international flight to Moscow! I thought I was gonna die having to deal with all of that. I called Virgin America customer service and a very nice gentlemen sent a message to the plane crew that 2 passengers were running late to their next flight and need assistance! There are no words to explain how grateful I am for your help! Virgin America have the best service!

### " my first and last experience"
I scheduled a Virgin America flight from San Diego to San Francisco the day before it was supposed to take off. The next day, 2.5 hours before my flight I got an email that said the entire flight was cancelled. I made the reservation only the night before - how could the entire flight be cancelled?! It was my first experience with Virgin American and also my last.

### "a wonderful flight"
Christmas Eve-Dallas Love to SFO. A fabulous experience! Movie, unique music playlist. Flight on time. Serene competent crew. Black rain clouds smooth landing. Virgin America my brand preference in the future. Thank you for a wonderful flight.

### "would absolutely recommend"
I was flying with Virgin America today and I was impressed. The seat comfort was amazing. Being 6/7, flying is not always easy. However, VA had lots of space for my legs and seats felt like being made for my size. It felt very comfortable. Even the headrest was high enough (which did not happen to me yet and I am a frequent flyer). Neither Lufthansa, Singapore Airlines and others had this comfort. The entertainment system offered everything you wanted. Movies, music, games, food and drink orders. In general, the plane seemed very modern. When ordering a gin tonic (the 50ml gin bottle was told to cost 8$, which is a regular price for short haul flights) they offered me 2 for 1 bottles. Soda was free. As I bought my ticket via Skypicker and had a connection flight, I cannot tell how much the single flight was which makes it difficult to state anything about value for money. Ground service was very solid and friendly, no complaints. Cabin staff could have been a little bit more friendly. When I was asking for an emergency exit seat (one emergency exit row was kept empty as any passenger could upgrade their seat for $150, which I think is a lot, especially having that great seat comfort, which I did not know at that time), the cabin staff was not overly friendly, however, they have not been rude at any time. Altogether, I would absolutely recommend Virgin America, at least when they are using the plane I was flying in. Thank you Virgin America for this experience!

### "the service was great"
Virgin America from Washington Dulles to San Francisco. The in-flight entertainment was good and cabin crew very friendly. The seat back monitors allowed you to order drinks right then and there. The drinks are free, and although the food is not, the prices are very reasonable. Seats are comfortable, as for leg room, I am only 5'8" so I don't really have problems with leg room, but from the looks of it, somebody of average height would have a good amount of leg room. The ground crew were nice and the check-in was smooth and fast. The only remotely negative things about Virgin America are that the remotes are a bit challenging to use (just me being picky) and that it is more expensive than most airlines for a transcontinental, domestic flight. With that being said though, you get what you pay for and the service was great!

### "will avoid flying with Virgin"
I purchased a round trip ticket from SFO to JFK. Due to some changes with my work schedule, I had to fly to Texas during the week of my flight and subsequently I planned to skip my initial flight from SFO-JFK and simply use my business return leg to get to JFK. I learned that if a first leg of a flight was not attended and no cancellation was issued within two hours the entire flight is cancelled with no notification being sent. As a result I was now stranded at JFK with no ticket. When calling the help line I learned they do not offer customer assistance on the weekend and I would be forced to buy a new flight. My original flight was full and a new one way flight home was going to cost over 800, almost 3x the original round trip ticket and there would be no comp of my original ticket value that was never used. The flight assistant provided no real options and pretty much told me good luck. Also, there would be a $50 booking fee since it was the weekend. Terrible experience and insane policy. Customer experience and support were awful and I will avoid flying with Virgin at all costs going forward.

### "seats had been changed"
Have generally been satisfied with Virgin America, though lately we have felt it necessary to pay extra for slightly more leg room and earlier boarding. Tonight I was surprised when printing out our boarding pass that our slightly better and more expensive seats had been changed without our knowledge. According to the agent, someone had called the airline and usurped our seats. Not a huge deal. The someone pushed us 4 rows back. But just goes to show that Virgin is just as money-grubbing as the rest.

### "pleasantly surprised how nice"
After so many horrible flights on American Airlines, I really wasn't expecting much. I was pleasantly surprised how nice this Virgin America flight was. I am not a fan of the Australian Virgin offering, but this was a flight with friendly and warm crew, excellent entertainment, a new and clean aircraft, and a comfortable seat. I don't think I will waste my time and money with AA anymore after some of the rudest airline service I have ever encountered. This was a very comfortable and modern flight.

### "more expensive than other airlines"
Value for money - when I priced my ticket it was the same as Jetblue and American Airlines but more expensive than other airlines. And it doesn't not cover baggage. Ground service - easy to print boarding pass since the kiosks were so easy and available. Seat comfort, the seats were not comfortable. Not enough leg room and cushions were worn. All the rest were rated one star because they lacked it, they really did. I'm on a six hour flight going from LA to NY, I'm ok if they do not serve food since it won't be good anyway, but they served beverages only once and no snack. Since flight attendants does not have much to do and only need to serve beverages once, you would think they would treat with better. They seemed reluctant when asked if they can take my empty cup. They do not smile or look friendly, felt judged and unwelcomed. In flight wifi requires payment so there goes half of my entertainment. The rest is tv but very limited,  I was not very happy with my return flight. Now I understand why the flight was only half filled.

### "most unprofessional crew"
We took the red eye from Los Angeles to Fort Lauderdale, about 5 hours. Unfortunately we were seated at the back of the plane where the flight attendants spent the majority of the flight talking so loud, nonstop, we couldn't sleep. We had two small children with us so my husband asked them to please keep their voices down so that at least our children could try to get some much needed sleep. One flight attendant acknowledged him, and obviously felt bad, while the others decided that they should talk and laugh louder than before. The worst, most unprofessional crew I've experienced.

### "I was very disappointed"
This Virgin America flight experience is not the one I have grown accustomed to. Unlike other flights, the crew made excuses for everything. Some people waited over two hours for their beverages and / or food. The service was not well orchestrated and the attendants were grumpy. The bathrooms looked trashy after about the 1/2 way point with trash on the floor and countertops. Trash can was full as well. The seat back consoles did not work. There was one attempt to reboot them and that got the network going but not the TV. The new Netflix access was up and down the entire flight. The flight was normal and no complaints on departure or smoothness of ride. But for a cross country flight you need more than that. I have flown this route on this airline many times and was very disappointed in my go-to airline. Might have to try Jet Blue next time.

### "we were really impressed"
This is the first time we have flown Virgin America and we were really impressed. We usually fly business class on another airline. It was a new plane and we were main cabin select right behind first class. There was not a wall but a colored glass partition. Plenty of room, free food and drinks. Everyone had their own computer for music, movies, tv and to order food and drinks. Food and drinks were free in main cabin select as well as internet until March of next year. Good food, good service, plenty of room. Similar plane on the way home.

### "overall I was very impressed"
I flew Virgin America 3 times within three weeks from CHI to SFO and back. The first trip was on Virgin America because it was the cheapest. The second was because I was extremely impressed with the quality of the airline. I flew American on one of those legs due to a last minute obligation on my part and Virgin America is a league above. The leg room is plentiful and seats are comfortable; I'm 6'4" and didn't feel cramped at all. JetBlue, Virgin America and Turkish are the only 3 airlines where I fit comfortably in economy class. There are also power outlets at each seat. Every seat has its own TV screen with plenty of free and paid media options. You can order food and drinks through the TV, a very slick system and much preferable to the old call button approach. Soft drinks are free, but all food must be paid for. However it's reasonable. I paid $13 for a small bottle of champagne and a generous cheese, meat and veggie platter. The staff is very friendly and the cabin has trendy purple and blue mood lighting, modern music and an "interesting" safety music video en lieu of the typical demonstration. It's a fun approach to the staid airline protocol we're used to. Overall I was very impressed and would pay a bit more to fly Virgin America when possible.

We flew JetBlue to San Francisco due to a massive credit. JetBlue is also our airline of choice for vacation. However, JetBlue's times for San Francisco to Boston were not very compatible with our schedule, so we decided to fly Virgin America back. Check-in was fast, and before we knew it, we were at the gate with 1.5 hours before boarding. We went to a restaurant conveniently located next to the gate and returned with 15 minutes before boarding. Boarding went quickly too, and when we got on the plane, the cabin was lit up in deep purples and blues. I found that the entertainment was not quite as impressive as JetBlue's, but it was still good. The food selection could also have more variety. But those were not big problems, because the Gulfstream shortens the flight by an hour and were in Boston in 5.5 hours. Virgin only has one gate at Logan and it is located near baggage claim, which was nice because it was 11.30pm. Overall, my first flight on Virgin America was a success.

When I flew with VX I was impressed, however there were a few problems. My screen froze a lot, and my seat barely reclined. I did like that there was a good selection of music and that you could watch live tv. Overall the flight was great.

First time with this airline, one way from LAX to ORD in First Class. Plane clean, seats comfortable, staff friendly from beginning to end. The food was good, although the salad (while good) was a bit small portion-wise. Would fly them again.

### Virgin America customer review
No frills airline. Everything costs extra. No free checked luggage. All food and snacks cost money. Nickle and dime you to death. Little seats with little leg room. They or the connecting airline lost our luggage.

### Virgin America customer review
I had a wonderful experience flying with Virgin America. The flight was very affordable and was on time. The staff were fun and friendly. I would definitely fly with them again. They had screens on the back of the seats and free videos to select. Very entertaining.

### Virgin America customer review
Flew on 9 May BOS-LAX on VX 365 and return 21 May on VX 366 first time flying Main Cabin Select and it's well worth paying the extra to do so maybe next time I'll get lucky enough to fly First Class. Flying in MCS gets you complimentary meals and non-alcoholic drinks and the meals offered are miles ahead of what any other U.S. carrier would offer. Cabin crews courteous and efficient both ways though a big letdown was when I couldn't charge either my iPod or iPad in an e-mail I received from VX Customer Relations they stated that too many devices charging at the same time results in a drain to the onboard power it is something they're working on and I received compensation for that inconvenience. I definitely would fly with them again despite the issues as they at least give you something for your trouble rather than telling you to scram.

My first time with Virgin Air SeaTac to LAX. Customer service before the flight and at check in at SeaTac was excellent but flight delayed both ways. Lap trays not clean. Armrest not cleaned. Leg room - poor. Person next to me asked to buy headphones - sorry none available. No room in overhead! Perhaps because of new $25 bag check in rule! Much boasting about the Virgin Air experience - but it was very average or below average.

### Virgin America customer review
VX 927 LAX-SFO. Uneventful on-time flight good service value for money but free checked baggage only max 14 kg.

### Virgin America customer review
Flew FLL to LAX earlier this month. We were flying back from a cruise. The flight was unfortunately delayed 90 minutes. Once on-board the pilot apologized sincerely and gave everyone unlimited movies through the in-flight entertainment system for their inconvenience. In a world where airlines strand passengers on the tarmac for 7 hours (United 4/18/15 with no apologies) its nice to know that at least one airline still cares for its customers. I am a loyal flyer!

### Virgin America customer review
PDX to SFO 1st week April First Class cabin. Long-time VA customer with "gold" status. In short VA is looking a bit 'tired'. Service is inconsistent (eg like any organization most employees are good to great but the bad ones really stick out especially if they are 'experienced'). On this flight the seat was broken the food terrible and cabin service questionable. The plane interior is a bit tattered and worn from wear (ie soiled). Also the "mod" safety video is outdated (ie "can I have just the facts please") and it's a bit odd that alcohol is served at 7am in the morning. Thus this customer is starting to explore alternatives (which are best left unnamed in this post).

### Virgin America customer review
On 8th March I flew Virgin America in economy from SFO to LAS for $49.00 return. Was looking forward to the flight and it proved to be a positive experience. I was a bit put off by the loud rock music blaring by the check-in kiosk and a rather indifferent ground attendant herding people to and from the check-in area. I feel that airports are confusing and loud enough without the added distraction of loud music. I liked the mood lighting onboard and flight and crew very pleasant although the safety video was entertaining but to me a tad playful. The baggage charge of $25.00 was expected and on my return on the 10th of March I upgraded to First for $89.00 so the baggage fee was waived. The seats in First are very comfortable and pre-take off drinks were served by a very pleasant stewardess. Value for money on Virgin America on this trip was great and if you have checked baggage do the upgrade-it's well worth it.

Feb 27 2015 from FLL to LAX. Crew were rude and annoyed if you spoke to them. It was the first time I flew that they didn't walk down the aisle to ask if anyone wanted to buy headsets. When I asked the steward about the headsets she was annoyed that I didn't purchase on the computer screen. I really didn't want to wait another hour and she basically threw them at me and said to pay for them when I got a chance. On my flight home March 9 2015 as I was boarding the steward told the boarding agent that there was no more room for luggage in overhead bins. I was not happy about giving up my bag as I had things in there that should not go in a checked bag. She was insistent. When I finally boarded the flight there were 3 or 4 empty compartments right where I was sitting. I asked for my bags to be brought back too late was the answer.

### Virgin America customer review
I was sending 3 people out to Los Angeles for a job and the flight from JFK was cancelled with no reason given. it was a 7am flight and no other flights that day were cancelled. They had no seats available in later flights for me and no affiliations with other airlines so they said there was nothing they could do. I had to scramble at 9pm that night and spend 3 times as much to get them out to Los Angeles.

### Virgin America customer review
Overall I like Virgin however the beverage and staff service was very poor. Ordered a wine and it took two hours to arrive. Ordered a simple soft drink twice and never arrived but the monitor showed as completed. Was working and very difficult to get out from my seat.

### Virgin America customer review
I sat in Economy but paid the $30 to have expedited security and boarding privileges. I was seated in 4D right behind Economy Select. This is probably the best Economy cabin I've traveled in. Stylish comfortable decent amount of room (I'm 6'3"). The staff are well-groomed and enthusiastic. There was some shenanigans on board with two parties who kept wanting to switch seats and the flight attendants handled it with humor and ease. I had a short flight under three hours so the complimentary entertainment options on RED were plenty for me. Also when I went to the restroom the flight attendant opened the door for me. When I went in it was quite large well lit and played spa music. Also when washing my hands the faucet actually stayed on long enough for me to wash my hands instead of me having to keep depressing it. Again a small thing but it's this list of small things about Virgin that have made me a loyal customer. I paid $49 for my trip from DC to Dallas. For $49 I got: excellent service comfortable economy seating and free entertainment. If I have to list one negative I'd say it's the fact that the remote control for the entertainment system is a bit challenging to use.

### Virgin America customer review
San Francisco to Boston in December 2014. I felt truly welcomed by the courteous ground staff who went out of their way to help me check in at the kiosks which were malfunctioning that day. I was looking forward to the flight but was greatly disappointed by the aloof demeanour of the attendants on the flight that day who seemed more interested in associating with each other than serving passengers and making us feel welcome. I realize that Virgin America is a low cost no frills carrier with a modern flair but the flight attendants on duty that day should take a lesson from the charming pilots heading the flight by at least cracking a smile and welcoming passengers on board rather than avoiding eye contact and appearing preoccupied with personal concerns. Moreover I was greatly disappointed by the lack of hot meals sold on board where small cold sandwiches and junk food consisting of crackers chips and cookies dominate the in flight menu. If you're hungry I would recommend bringing your own food on board.

### Virgin America customer review
SFO/LAX F 12/28/14 early morning flight - very good service but 'breakfast' is a joke - trying to be cute with tiny squares of cheese 1/2 strawberry etc. - a bowl of cheerios would be much better. I like their style but hate the food offerings (have only flown SFO/LAX and v.v. ).

### Virgin America customer review
LAX-DAL in Main Cabin Select 08/12/14. We checked in online and utilized the express bag drop at LAX. There was a short line and we were attended to promptly by a cheerful agent. Main Cabin Select comes with priority security so we sailed through the TSA line. T3 at LAX is rather dour though this isn't VX's fault. Boarding started on time and we pushed back a few minutes early. The safety video is cheesy and gets annoying pretty quickly but otherwise service was excellent. FAs weren't exceptional but they were friendly and efficient and I personally think all airlines should adopt the in-seat ordering system for food and beverages you select whatever you want at your leisure and an FA brings it to you within a couple of minutes. Leather seat was comfortable and had plenty of legroom thanks to the bulkhead. Snacks were of good quality and the meal I ordered was tasty but not excessively heavy. We landed nearly 15 minutes early and we were in our car and on our way about 20 minutes after landing. Main Cabin Select is a good value as it includes one checked bag priority boarding and security and food and drink at no extra charge. We were impressed with VX will consider them more often now that they've beefed up service from Dallas.

### Virgin America customer review
I purchased an Economy Select Aisle seat I boarded the plan situated myself in the seat and within a few minutes was asked by a Virgin employee to see my boarding pass. They indicated another passenger had the same seat assignment who had the same last name as me. It turns out that this other person bought a different seat and at the gate an employee made an error and changed his seat to mine thinking he was me. Virgin didn't handle the situation well and out of respect for getting the plane boarded and on it's way I gave up my seat that I paid extra for and took and inferior seat. Virgin didn't offer to boat me for what I didn't end up getting and I don't have time to call them and complain. I'm certain they wouldn't reimburse me anyway. As far as flight operations our flight was Lax to Boston it took off 2 hours late because the invoking flight was late they kept the flight listed as on time even though they knew it was late hours before. Loading the plane took much longer than JetBlue or Southwest and I found the head seat entertainment system difficult to use. I will never fly them again.

### Virgin America customer review
I flew from LGA-DAL in their infancy of their LaGuardia to Dallas-Love Field route. Going through security at LaGuardia was quick and smooth. Never had any problems. Virgin's gate is the diamond in the rough of what is Terminal B in LaGuardia. Boarding was on time for both ways of the flights. The seats in Economy Class were fair and decently spacious with its leather exterior and cushion. The DISH Network with the regular channels sufficed for me both ways. The ability to order drinks at my seat was a first but very interesting. You select your desired drink and the attendants bring it to your seat. It was a great experience flying Virgin. No fuss no muss. Definitely get your bang for the buck.

### Virgin America customer review
San Francisco to Washington/DCA Nov 8-Nov 11. Both ways boarded early and left the gate early. Our flight attendant started us off with whatever drink we wanted before the people in main cabin were even onboard. The nice mood lighting and the seats that go almost all the way was excellent. The airlines Red system is excellent and fast. Right after takeoff with a hot towel then onto warmed nuts next was a smoked turkey orange and pistachio salad which was very yummy. For my main course I had a filet mignon which was very juicy and cooked perfectly. Also the flight attendant came around often with great snacks. Will be flying Virgin America more often!

Flight 27 - JFK to SFO on November 11 2014. Check-in was a breeze. TSA pre-check was a breeze. Seats were in economy. Inflight service was very good. Staff on the ground and in-flight were courteous and friendly. Finally and to my surprise baggage at SFO came out in what seems to be record time.

### Virgin America customer review
LA -Seattle First Class Oct 11. A very comfortable nice experience. The snack lunch offered was perfect and nicely presented the service very nice and the seat just fine for a short flight but not good enough for a trans con in my opinion. One important note the tragically hip safety announcement has to go. It is jarring loud and actually encourages one to not pay attention to important information. I understand the attempt but the execution is embarrassing.

### Virgin America customer review
Oct 1st LAX-LAS in First. Great experience although disappointed that VX chooses to disclude a few routes from access to its lounge at LAX as they are considered short haul. Did not know that U.S. domestic coast to coast flights were considered "long" haul and thus given access to lounges. I just think passengers choosing to fly First have different needs for travel and throwing them to Starbucks and Burger King with 2000 other screaming passengers is not a bright idea especially as there are no other lounges to choose at the terminal VX flies from in LAX. Anyway once in air nice experience. Clean beautiful cabins smooth service and welcome champagne offered upon seating. On time and otherwise smooth experience.

### Virgin America customer review
Just flew with Virgin America for the first time: SFO to ORD. Boarding was done efficiently and we left early. Flight was very smooth and we arrived early. Captain came around and introduced himself (a first for me!). Our flight attendant was very professional and made sure all our needs were met. I liked the soothing cabin lighting and the wide selection of movies. I highly recommend this airline they have brought back the fun of flying.

### Virgin America customer review
We were flying from San Francisco to Philadelphia. The first thing I saw when we checked our bags in was how nice the staff were and there was peaceful music on with colorful seats. In a good mood we started to board. I noticed they had screens on the back of seats were you could watch TV play games and order food and drinks. It was the best flight I have taken! I will be coming back.

Flew VX 928 on 24 Aug 14 SFO-LAX. The aircraft was clean and the ground and cabin staff were helpful. On a flight of 1 hour were offered only snacks from the basket which meant potato chips candy bars etc. The pre- flight safety video was quite annoying as it was more or less a sing-song of instructions to follow with a rap- type beat.

### Virgin America customer review
Flew LAX - SFO 19 Aug in Main Cabin. The short flight was on time the aircraft clean and the staff very friendly. The leg room was also sufficient - my wife struggles with some seats on other airlines as she has long legs - no problems here. A great experience and thoroughly recommended.

Flight 805 and 136 on August 16 2014. My first time on Virgin America. I only had a 35 min. layover in San Francisco. We all know what that means or usually means: missed connecting flight long layover into wee hours of the night bags on different plane. The gate attendant told me "not to worry". The flight from Portland was 30 min. late leaving we arrived in San Francisco just as my flight was scheduled to leave. To my amazement an airport attendant was doing down the ramp and called out my name. When I answered she said: "Follow Me. Your flight is waiting for you! Sure enough she walked me to my gate and on I went. Seat was still available (amazing). A place for my overhead bag right by my seat (even more amazing). As I buckled in I noticed there was not only a place to plug in my iPod but a screen at each seat with a remote so you weren't poking the person in front of you all the time! I was able through the programs to select a beverage any time I wished and they brought it asap! The icing on the cake was that my bag was transferred to my plane in that short window of time and it was one of the first to pop out of the chute! I will be booking on Virgin American for all possible future flights.

### Virgin America customer review
First class LAX to PHL: The flight attendant was in the front of the plane for about 30 minutes of the entire 5 hour flight. We did not get a drink until 20 minutes into the flight. This is the 6th first class flight with Virgin and this will be the last. I had to push my call button to get a drink and my dirty dishes cleaned up! Never once did they show they were happy to have you on board. If this had been a one time event I could over look it but there seems to be a theme here.

### Virgin America customer review
Sound be called Nickel and Dime Airlines. I had flown Virgin Atlantic to London from LAX and thought Virgin America would be just as good. Was I wrong! Surly staff and charge upon charge for everything. Disorganized boarding in Los Angeles with a very rude ticket agent. There was a 3 hour delay to NY because of the weather not their fault. When we landed in NY some Delta passengers who had taken the same route (LAX-JFK) and also been delayed told us they were given free headphones food and drinks to compensate. Virgin America didn't give us anything. Never again.

SEA-LAX in Y on an A319. Good inflight service from the crew and an early arrival into LAX. Inflight safety video certainly got our attention.

LAX-PHL October 2013. Hawaiian Air booked our flight since they don't fly to Philadelphia they did the leg LAX- PHL on Virgin America. We upgraded and paid I believe an extra $129 for the one way upgrade for a flight that would be 5 hours and a little more. This was one of the best things we spent money on we got to pick the very first row after first class its separated by a see through partition. We also got more leg space early boarding lots of entertainment to pick from. Prior to the flight spoke to several CSR on the phone and everyone I spoke to was very nice and professional. Since we upgraded we got unlimited food and drinks you just order on the screen in front and its delivered to your seat in a timely manner. The selections were very good. The flight attendants were pleasant.

Sydney Australia to Philadelphia USA via Hilo and Maui Hawaii. My trip started at Sydney business class on Hawaiian airlines I'm a Platinum member and have been for countless years I was met in the business line by the always attentive and friendly station manager who made sure I had no hiccups in checking in and off and had a good meal and few drinks in Air NZ lounge. Flight was nice wasn't the best crew but they were professional and consistent. Arrive Honolulu get through customs quickly and managed to transfer to an early inter island flight a perk for being platinum. 1st class Hilo to Maui quick 49min flight all on time. LAX to Philadelphia - this was my first time in first class and it will not be my last - great crew and food. The staff were all polite professional and helpful. My return trip was quick smooth check-in at Philadelphia. I took main cabin select as first was full this too is a great product food and drinks included and delivered via an order system built into your TV screen. Wifi was very cheap - 11 dollars for 3 hours.

SFO to JFK on 7/24/14 and JFK to SFO on 7/28/14. Check-in (baggage drop) was uneventful and went quickly. Counter staff were courteous. Both flights went well. Pleasant attentive flight crew. Seats were comfortable for me but I am not particularly tall or overweight. There was enough free content on the seat back entertainment system to keep me occupied on the cross country flights. Having a dedicated AC electrical outlet ensured that my I-Pad stayed functional.

We flew with Virgin America on our return flight from JFK New York to LAX. The plane was near new and well appointed. We were most disappointed with the flight crew on the flight. We were seated near the rear of the plane close to the galley and toilets and had to put up with crew talking amongst themselves quite loudly for lengthy times during the flight which was annoying when we were trying to sleep. We would try to avoid using them again if we can.

I flew on Virgin America flight #89 at 9.15am today from IAD to LAX in First Class. Other than asking me which breakfast dish I would like the flight attendant did not offer me anything to drink or ask if I needed anything for the five+ hour long flight. Not only that but I had a hard time getting her attention the entire flight. With 40 minutes left in the flight I finally waved her down and asked her for water. I have flown over 5 million miles on American Airlines alone and I have been considering Virgin as an ideal alternative until I spent as much as I did for first class and literally had to track down our flight attendant for a glass of water. My experiences with the positive attitude of Southwest Airlines' and American Airlines' flight attendants have been exceptional compared to today with Virgin.

### Virgin America customer review
Flew from JFK to Vegas on 16th June 2014. The check in experience at JFK was absolutely horrific with snarling aggressive staff who took great delight in seating 4 of us in totally separate areas of the plane. Perhaps it was because it was early on Monday morning or perhaps it was because when they found out we had already paid the $25 baggage tariff whatever the reason we appeared to have completely ruined their day such was their complete and utter contempt towards us. There was no eye contact no communication whatsoever just the faintest of a wry smile when she saw our shock at the seating arrangements we had been given. When challenged the response was "that's the best I could do". They have lost 4 passengers.

June 13th VX321 FLL-LAX. June 18thVX334 LAX-FLL. We heard so much about Virgin America and how they are the best to fly. When we departed the staff at the gate were not friendly. When we got on the plane to LA there was one very friendly flight attendant. The rest seemed annoyed. I ordered a Coke for my son and it never came so I asked a flight attendant she never came back with it then it was I guess 45 min. before landing and another attendant came around and when asked she said I need to order it on the screen and the ordering time was up I told her I ordered it on the screen over an hour ago and she acted like she didn't believe me so she checked my screen then went and got the drink. When going back home to Ft. Laud the ticket counter girl in LA was rude didn't tell us what gate to go to then the flight attendants were very rude - again as if they were annoyed to be there and the remote controls and TV screens were sticky and filthy. The good thing is that the pilot got us there and back on time as scheduled and it was a non-stop flight. I think Virgin America needs some serious Customer Service training implemented.

Virgin trip from Las Vegas to NYC was the worst flight I've ever had. The staff (a supervisor and her sidekick) at the terminal was crude and unprofessional. This will be my last trip on Virgin and I suspect they will continue to lose customers given the quality of their staff.

### Virgin America customer review
SFO-LAX-MCO on 4/24/14 and return on 4/30/14. Overall good flights. Friendly attentive in-flight crews. Seats are comfortable enough for me. I believe they are slightly larger than on many other airlines. There are enough free entertainment options (Direct TV music) to keep me happy. The only problem encountered was not Virgin's fault - the Air Traffic Control system went down in Los Angeles on 4/30 and screwed up everything. Our 9.30pm departure from LAX to SFO ended up leaving at 1.35am. It would be nice if the FAA would get their act together.

### Virgin America customer review
Paid for the main cabin select upgrade not really worth the extra money. Flew from SFO-FLL. This was the most unfriendly flight crew I have ever flown with. No smiles no real interaction. Made me feel guilty for asking for a soda. Virgin really needs to make improvements with their staff.

### Virgin America customer review
Be prepared to pay for everything. Additional costs you don't think of when booking your flight added $90 more dollars to my trip: Check baggage meal and a movie. The seats are cramped and I'm a petite person. I flew to DC from San Diego changed planes in San Francisco. All day internet pass was 16$ from San Diego to San Francisco same all day internet pass from San Francisco to DC was 36$. You would think an all day pass would be the same price The days don't get longer only the flights. Greedy very Greedy. I will never fly Virgin again.

### Virgin America customer review
Who designed the seats? It reclines about 1/2 inch and feels like 1/4. When it's in it's upright position I actually felt like I was leaning forward. Put your seats in an upright position before landing? The seat is upright when it's fully reclined! My elbow kept going into the armrest channel / volume control which was carefully positioned to maximum discomfort. My red eye flight from LAX to FLL left me with a mangled spine and crooked neck. I won't even mention the embarrassing prices to watch an in flight movie or TV show.

### Virgin America customer review
Boston - LAX April 9. Possibly the worst cabin attendants I have ever experienced no communication skills almost threw the food at us were of no other assistance (even though we were in cabin select). The cabin crew spent most of the flight watching movies or reading magazines at the rear of the plane. Cabin select was of no value at all. Travelling cabin select was a worse experience than travelling economy with Delta.

Flew SFO-FLL on 3/17/14 first class (seats 1 AB). Check-in at SFO was fast and efficient and took only a few minutes with no one in front of us. The lounge at SFO is futuristic but unattractive with an overdose of reds and blacks and uncomfortable seating. Boarding was quick with no problem. The flight crew was aloof and seemed preoccupied. They all wear street clothes. Although well attired - no uniforms? It appears very unprofessional and exudes little confidence. There is no closet for garments. I was told to store my jacket in the overhead bin - really? In first class? Food service was mediocre at best. A choice of two appetizers and two entrees. We ordered the rice noodles main course and as I don't expect anything close to gourmet food the food was cold and inedible. The flight attendant was nowhere to be found although seen frequently during the flight sitting in the jump seat in the galley. Although dessert was included as part of the meal service none was provided. I emailed customer service with my comments and received no reply which I find inexcusable.

EWR-LAX. Airbus Industrie A320 JET. The Ground Crew was fine. When we got on the plane the seats were very crammed in but the cabin crew was good. You had to pay for basically anything you want on a plane food movies $8.00 but the juice was free. We didn't reserve seat so they put us at the back of the plane where you heard the flight attendants talking loudly. In the bathroom the sink was odd and they didn't announce how to use it. Eventually figured it out. I ended up watching TV shows on my computer. I'll never fly with them again if I don't have to.

Flew LAX-FLL Flt 330 on Mar 17 2014 - seat 1A-1B. The check-in process was efficient quick and courteous. Upon boarding I asked the flight attendant for a place to hang my suit jacket. I was advised that there is no closet and to place it flat in the overhead bin. The flight attendants were very inattentive. Most of the time spent in the jump seat reading. Meal service included a meagre salad and a choice of two entrees. I choose the rice noodles. The food was not heated properly. Although dessert was included on the menu none was offered. Seats do not fully recline to flat bed but were reasonably comfortable for the 5 hour flight. In-flight entertainment was good and included various selections in addition to satellite live broadcasts.

### Virgin America customer review
Seat rows are jammed together cramped and seats have a bulky non-removable head "rest" which compelled me to tip my head forward and down pushing my face even closer to the already too-close seat in front of me. This was unendurable in an overnight flight when I longed to recline as much as possible but was forced into this forward- head position. Aisle was so narrow that it was impossible to avoid knocking into seated passengers when navigating to the restroom (I am slim and small). Horrible experience. Hard to imaging ever flying VA again.

Disappointed with a round-trip SFO-LAX-SFO in Main Cabin Select - food selection is pretty pathetic - the 'Hearty Meal' is a box containing a tiny bag of some kind of chips/crisps about 4 slices of salami and a little pot of something else. Service was generally very good on both flights - but again my unfortunate neighbor tried to order a snack on the menu that apparently was not available - the flight attendant said 'only what's on the menu on the screen' - his choice was included in the on-screen menu! It was a long day and so the lighting did nothing for me but the general atmosphere is much better than UA and I would probably choose them again. Thankfully they have upgraded their sparkling wine since my last flight with them a few years ago!

I flew from Las Vegas to San Fran with a connecting flight from San Fran to Philadelphia. After flying with Spirit from Philly to Las Vegas this was a welcoming experience. First time flying with Virgin I got a really good deal. Wanted to change my flight at the last min but prices were outrageous. A $900 difference. But other than that I would definitely recommend this airline to travelers. Traveled with elderly father and the wheelchair assistance and their employees were great with the airline and the employees at Las Vegas and San Fran. Philly was not overly friendly but that was to be expected.

Outgoing SFO-JFK. Return JFK-SFO. The seating comfort legroom food quality and selection and entertainment on Virgin America has declined over the last year from my personal rating of Very Good to Great to Disappointing at Best and Very Uncomfortable. Seat size and legroom as a standard have declined markedly and steadily. Both of my recent flights on American and United have had better seats more leg room and much better food. The selection of videos and entertainment has decreased. Lastly is the food - it is cheap. The choice of entrees are worse than you can find in a gas station. Regardless of the abysmal conditions currently on VA the people are uniformly very nice and do the best they can. I paid an extra $399 on this trip to upgrade to first class after I boarded the plane and found that I could not turn my shoulders in a standard exit row seat with a seat mate of normal weight and size as am I. A big price to pay just to be able to have room for my laptop. Food was OK but nothing close to the many other first class meals I've had.

LAX to Dulles October 2013. This was my first trip on Virgin America and I will save the additionally money to fly with them next time. I love being able to order food/drinks on the interactive screen and watch the news as well credit card automatically charged for any expenditures and the information is deleted after the flight hits close to your destination. The seat I had was an aisle one and very comfortable really it seemed like just after we took off it was time to buckle down for landing. The only thing I can find to criticize has nothing to do with Virgin it has to do with Dulles it's quite a trip from the main lobby where Virgin is located to the actual gate involving elevators and a subway train ride.

IAD to SFO on 2/11/14. Friendly courteous and attentive cabin crew and staff at check-in counter. Everything went well. Baggage claim at SFO seemed to take a bit longer than usual.

### Virgin America customer review
SFO to IAD on 2/6/14. Check-in was quick. Friendly agent at check-in counter. Boarding went quickly. Attentive and friendly cabin crew. Flight arrived early (tail winds). Bags were already in baggage claim by the time we got there from the aircraft. Great experience from start to finish.

### Virgin America customer review
San Francisco to Fort Lauderdale and back via Los Angeles. 1/25/14 and 2/2/14. Never ever again VA. You can't recline the seats. The arm rest is super uncomfortable since the remote control is on top of it. You don't even get a bag of nuts on a 6 hour flight you have to pay for it which means you need to get you cc out of the overhead compartment but everything is so tight. The airplane kitchen is almost in the tiny bathroom. The stewards have hardly room to manage anything. But they have a rap song to tell you how to put on your seat belt. You have to pay for movies ear phones and no pillow or blanket.

### Virgin America customer review
First and last trip on Virgin America. I had flown Virgin Atlantic to London years ago and had a bad experience. Uncomfortable seats no legroom. This time round trip LAX / JFK. Really not good. The worst terminal at LAX. Bad food. Flight was late. Seat terribly uncomfortable. Still No Legroom. Bad TV choices. No free movies you've heard of. On the return flight my seat was broken and didn't recline. Staff was unconcerned. They charge $25 per bag and don't provide a meal - I guess this is common but on Jet Blue they don't charge for a bag and the seats are comfortable. Nothing to recommend this airline except nice lighting and music.

### Virgin America customer review
Flew in Sept 2013 from LAX to JFK. My mother and I were very impressed and we felt at home after flying Virgin Australia domestically within Australia. The 2 airlines are very similar. Nice new plane clean interior with mood lighting. Wide selection of food available to purchase at a reasonable price. Nice smooth flight across the country. Whizzed through check-in early morning flight in LA. We love that the planes all have quirky funny names!

### Virgin America customer review
Flight 187 from Newark to San Francisco Dec 20 2013. The aircraft was cold when we boarded and we were told the heating would be turned on once the door was closed and there was nothing they could do in the interim. So we all actually went into our bags and pulled out our jackets to put them on. When I was offered a beverage before takeoff I asked for a hot tea I was told there would be no hot beverages before takeoff. I was offered the lunch menu for our flight however they insisted on serving lunch at 11 am (origin time) which was 8 am at our destination. There was no question or flexibility of serving the meal even an hour later even though it was a 6 hour flight. As is customary a few minutes before the plane began the initial descent for landing there was an announcement to facilitate those who need to go to the restroom or access the overhead bins before the fasten seatbelt light comes on. However immediately after the stewardess made the PA announcement she went into the only first class restroom there was and stayed in there for 20 mins. No one in first class could use the restroom because the fasten seatbelt light was switched on by the time the stewardess came out. She apologized as she walked by us with her make-up bag under her arm. Given I paid $3600 for this first class round-trip to NY I have to confess that for the first time in my experience with Virgin America did I find it to to be an inferior airline to United. Additionally it seems that Virgin America has lost it's "cool" factor. Case in point is the new safety video which is stylistically a cross between a badly choreographed low budget broadway musical and a 90's jingle from a supermarket detergent ad.

### Virgin America customer review
Arrived at SFO from SEA for a connecting flight to Las Vegas. Flight was delayed first one hour then two hours and then 3 hrs. The gate crew kept reassuring that a part was being installed in the plane and it would be ready for loading. The flight was cancelled after 4 hours. I was booked on another flight and not compensated for anything. I had to take the last seat available and missed all my connections for ground transportation to Utah. This is my second and last bad experience with Virgin America.

### Virgin America customer review
SFO-SJD-SFO main cabin going main cabin select return. Both flights left on time and arrived 15-30 minutes early. Flight attendants were friendly and helpful despite grumbling from some passengers on the fully booked flights. The extra legroom in main cabin select was well worth the additional cost.

### Virgin America customer review
This is my first experience with Virgin America and unfortunately it will be my last. Just set up two tickets to LAX from DFW. On one ticket the online system allowed me to select a seat next to the other ticket but as I proceeded to check out it declared I had not selected a seat. On the 4th try the seat selection still did not work and the fare increased another $40+. I called for assistance and was told seat was available and that they handled it. When I asked about the increase in fare they said yes that is the way it works sometimes if you are on the system for 15 minutes the fares can increase. This is not the consumers fault that Virgin's online system did not work properly but they penalize the consumer. DFW is extremely competitive and this cost Virgin two customers.

### Virgin America customer review
Main Cabin Select is comfortable and they throw in enough amenities including priority TSA lines to make it worth the extra price. Main Cabin is not a good experience. The seats are really small and close together and they make you pay for everything. The DISH Network TV is free but the programming is very mediocre and on my flight the sound kept going out. They also constantly interrupt your viewing with announcements which get pretty grating when it's pumped directly into your head. Southwest's regular seats are significantly more comfortable than Virgin America's Main Cabin and JetBlue give you free snacks. The flight crew were courteous but there's far too much activity in the cabin with the flight attendants bringing snacks and drinks to passengers on almost a continual basis because everyone can place orders on their TV screens.

### Virgin America customer review
SF Vegas LA. Two short but great flights in first class. Light delicious snacks extremely comfortable seats and eager to please staff on the ground and in the air. This is how it should be done up front.

### Virgin America customer review
I was so disappointed. I had a 4 hour flight in a very tight uncomfortable space. The couple behind me had 2 small children that were uncontrollable. They kicked my seat the whole flight and cried the whole trip. The TV wasn't working and I really doubt that headphones would have helped the situation. My flight back was not much better. I was so excited for my trip and had heard great things about Virgin Airlines but I was completely let down.

### Virgin America customer review
I flew on flight 720 from Dallas to San Francisco and I had a great experience. The flight attendants were excellent check-in was great and the flight left on time! Satisfied customer.

### Virgin America customer review
Flew from BOS-SFO-BOS and continue to be impressed it's definitely a cut above the competition. Nice new planes with comfortable leather seats and cool lighting. Crews are always friendly. Good selection of both free satellite TV and pay per view. Also love the online ordering on the seatback TV but wish they stocked just a few more fresh food options (usually you get a choice of a couple of light options such as wraps and salads but wish they would have more substantial choices to choose from). Also the powerports at every seat really makes a difference. One small detail that is easily overlooked but which I greatly appreciate is the Google Maps feature that tracks where your plane is. Unlike other airlines (JetBlue and Frontier) who keep on interrupting the Map View every few seconds with their annoying ads the Virgin version is ad-free.

### Virgin America customer review
Flew on their 09.50 service from JFK to Las Vegas on 5th October. This was my first experience of VA and they were brilliant. The flight attendants were friendly helpful and polite. The cabin was pristine and the mood lighting added to the whole ambience of calm. If this is typical of the airline then what a fantastic product and I look forward to flying with them again.

### Virgin America customer review
BOS-SFO. Inbound flight was great. Traveling Main Cabin Select was worth the extra money. All entertainment food drinks and baggage was included. I loved the priority security. My one complaint was that on the return flight they turned off the ordering system about 2 hours prior to landing. It really negated the free food and drinks. They did offer a bottle of water though.

### Virgin America customer review
VA 752 from LAX to SFO was scheduled to depart at 11.20pm but was delayed because the clouds were below 2000ft which it can't so SFO close the airport. Departure was pushed back to 12.30pm and Virgin did not inform us until we reached the gate. We boarded the plane finally and right back into the delay segment again same problem with SFO. However the captain and the crew was excellent and displayed true professionalism and great service. Captain went about and personally informed passengers of the problem and the FA made jokes which cheered us up. Delays continued as we sat on the tarmac for another 1 hr before we finally took off at 3.20pm. Without the positive attitude from its FA this flight would be miserable but luckily it was not.

### Virgin America customer review
Flew JFK to SFO. A small plane six seats wide. Three on either side. Seats were crammed in. I paid extra for an express seat but don't see what value actually received for that other than getting on board second to the last calling. In the front it was terribly warm with little air circulation. The flights were longer than that of a larger plane which I would fly on American Airlines. I was so miserable and so uncomfortable. Would never fly this airline again. Never.

### Virgin America customer review
LAX-EWR on 22/6/13 for a red-eye and returned 19/7/13 with an EWR-LAX flight in the late afternoon. Overall Virgin has proved to have better service better planes and an overall better atmosphere than the likes of American Airlines and United when I have flown in the past. Their fee policy wasn't bad compared to other airlines. For the most part at least water and soda were free. The cabin crews had no problem on either flight providing me these at all. From baggage drop-off to disembarkation Virgin provided a quality service. The one caveat I had was having to use the rear-lavatory each flight because the front is reserved for First Class only. Because I paid $30 for Main Cabin Express (it's worth it despite this) I feel it to be a slap in the face to exclusively use the read one when the front is less of a hassle. As far as the seats go they are the most comfortable I have ever sat in for an aircraft. I always had smelly or worn fabric when flying American. Plus I wasn't scrunched up in Economy with Virgin coming from a 6ft guy. All that really mattered to me is that I was able to get free drinks (with no hassle from stewards) my baggage came back in one piece I could actually recline a little and sleep comfortably and I didn't miss my favourite primetime shows while in the air!

### Virgin America customer review
First time on this airline but am very impressed clean customer friendly plane and the crew were very friendly interactive with passengers and let you know they appreciated your business. Flew from Vegas to Frisco then on to Portland OR. At all 3 places there was always a VA staff member to see if they could help or get you something. Had a 2 hour layover in SF and I was in a wheelchair someone came about every 15 to 20 mins to see if I needed to go anywhere or get anything.

### Virgin America customer review
Return flight from Los Angeles to Orlando. Checked in very early and upgraded to Main Cabin Select. Upgrade includes a checked bag a free head set and unlimited food drinks and movies on demand onboard. The extra leg space was a God send / see previous review. Flight was not completely full but still slight delay in departure plus a very long drive around LAX to a runway on the other side of the airport. All female inflight staff were efficient but lacked the warmth of the crew on my outbound flight. Capt. came on early to discuss weather issues en route which was greatly appreciated as the flight took a long strange journey to Orlando and arrived about 15 minutes late. The crew on this flight did not make an announcement for last calls before they shut down the ordering system and unlike the first crew at some points gathered in the rear galley to chit chat. Crews on both flights did not tidy up the restrooms which were always in great demand. I highly recommend upgrading to Main Cabin Select especially for cross country flights on Virgin America.

### Virgin America customer review
Traveled from Newark to LAX. I don't particularly enjoy flying but was comforted by the soft lighting and happy faces on the attendants. The service was great. The seats were definitely roomier than any other airline that I've been on. Captain's updates timely and comforting. Food - no complaint. Also took Virgin back from LAX 2 weeks later. Same great service seats attendants cleanliness.

### Virgin America customer review
Orlando-Los Angeles. I arrived early at the airport plenty of staff on hand and baggage was accepted without a wait. Flight was packed without a single empty seat. Boarding is done by Cabin Special needs and zones and quickly turned into a scrum. The seats while stylish looking are very close together. They are much more narrow than they look. I'm a big guy at 6'2" 235lbs and just getting into my seat I found it an impossibly small space. With a small personal item under the seat there is zero space. Thankfully during flight I could take it out from under the seat and it was not so bad. The crew for this flight mostly male with a single female serving were on top of their game. The Red inflight system for entertainment and ordering was brilliant. First service is rather awkward traditional front to back then it's all on demand. The food I purchased was a great Pastrami Sandwich. Nothing seemed too much trouble for this crew. They politely advised in advance when they would shut down the ordering service so people could get last requests in. Flight was only a few minutes delayed in departure and landing. Virgins Terminal in LAX is almost exactly as it was when it belonged to TWA and Eastern. Baggage claim was noisy crowded and of limited space. Overall very happy with Virgin America and looking forward to my trip home.

### Virgin America customer review
LAX-SFO: Simple flight made easier by a relaxed crew. Great entertainment system blankets and pillows and a nice flow of a small meal and after-meal snack plus plenty to drink. Flight crew was very attentive from the moment of boarding and remained friendly throughout. Never had a grumpy flight crew with Virgin which cannot be said for other domestic carriers. Really great if you're a fan of the SF Giants on this particular route as they show World Series highlights on the SF Giants channel.

### Virgin America customer review
On a 4 hour flight from DC to Los Angeles there was no complimentary snacks just sodas and water. 2 restrooms served a full plane and there was always a line of 4-5 people. First class had a restroom but no one could use it. Flight attendants were less than compassionate. The monitors in the head rest were not working for 3 of the 4 hour trip. I will never use this airline again!

### Virgin America customer review
We flew back from LA to DFW on 7/9/13 and we absolutely loved VA. One of the best flights out of the 10 flights that we flew the prior week. They have music headphones and TV's behind every seat. I am someone that is scared of flying but I felt really at ease when flying Virgin. I would recommend it.

### Virgin America customer review
Uncomfortable seats and tardy planes. The economy seats from San Francisco to Anchorage were the worst we have ever encountered in the USA. They only moved slightly in position without actually reclining. My companion found this intolerable and insisted we pay a lot extra to return in first class which was very comfortable. I survived the economy seats only because I had three seats across from the aisle to the window. The outbound fight was over two hours late and arrived in Anchorage at almost three a.m. The return flight was over an hour late. If I have alternatives I would not fly this airline again.

### Virgin America customer review
LAX-NYC return. Check-in a mess and overcrowded at LAX but so is everything. Tried to use the kiosks for checking in but international Mastercard and Visa cards not accepted for baggage or upgrades. Seems odd at JFK separately hauling your bags to a luggage belt after checking in - that's not communicated very well and it's something I haven't seen elsewhere. Flights delayed but nothing too bad. Cabin crew on all a bit sullen/unfriendly seeming but okay when talking to you. In-air food and movie purchases thwarted by international credit card issues. Was told off a little for bringing it up until the food cart came to my row and they could see the issue - charge for remaining choices was waived which was appreciated. Otherwise nice cabin with comfy seats and decent IFE options with directTV and wifi available. Lounge greeter at the Virgin lounge at LAX was really lovely - food options could be a little more filling as the bar is open and a few people seemed to be a little drunk.

### Virgin America customer review
I fly 2-3 times a year and usually have used other airlines. This time I decided to give Virgin America a try. The flight was from SEA-SFO-LAS and return the same way. All 4 flights were delayed. The first by 2 hours the second by 1.5 the third by 45 minutes and the final 2.5 hours. We were told different reasons each time and none of them matched up with each other. One said weather one said construction another said mechanical problems and even one said they had to find a pilot. Seats are terrible. Crew rude. And yes this happened on each part of our journey. For being my first experience with Virgin America I was more than unimpressed. I will not be flying with them again.

### Virgin America customer review
Los Angeles to Las Vegas 15/06 outbound and inbound is 20/06. Poor service despite only having 10 passengers onboard no soft drinks offered only beer wine and water. Staff more interested in talking to colleagues and organising their social life. On checking in for return flight staff unsure what to do were only able to give boarding cards for 1st out of 3 flights. Forgot to give us the luggage tags on check in so this caused no end of trouble with other flights.

### Virgin America customer review
DCA-SFO-DCA. One of the better cross-country flights that I've taken and added bonus of being non-stop. Boarding is a bit weird-front to back but airplane was new and clean. Young flight attendants were pleasant and a nice change from the surly FAs of the legacy carriers. Direct TV and audio free but movies headphones are extra. I'm a petite person(5 ft) and leg room and leather seat were roomy enough. Yes there is no free snacks but I brought food with me and ordered free drinks from the TV menu. All in all Virgin America is a great cross country airlines and I would fly with them again.

### Virgin America customer review
SFO-EWR (round trip) 4/24-4/28. One of the better airlines I've flown for domestic. The seats were more comfortable than the other airlines I have been on (Delta American). Staff were pretty friendly although at times were not as available as I would have liked. The food I would order did come almost instantly which I was very impressed about. Overall nothing to really complain about the flight and airline itself. The only thing was the delay I had but it was made up for in the air and I actually arrived about 20 minutes earlier even with a 30 minute delay.

### Virgin America customer review
Virgin America does many things well. They are usually on-time boarding is very organized they provide great on-demand in-flight entertainment wifi power/usb ports and generally clean planes. Satellite TV is complimentary but movies are not free and actually quite expensive. However there are areas for improvement. Economy seating is very cramped. On the near 6 hour trip from JFK-SFO my knees were jammed against the seat in front of me. IFE screen was also uncomfortably close to my face with the seat in front of me reclined. If you want more legroom you have to pay extra for "main cabin select. Furthermore there are no complimentary snacks. The "buy on board" food is not a good value. There is no hot food available for purchase and the sandwiches and salads are small and snacks are overpriced. Flight attendants are sometimes friendly and other times aloof. When I order a beverage from the seatback screen they sometimes completely ignore the request if it is a "complimentary" beverage. Yet if I pay for a cocktail it mysteriously shows up much faster. Overall Virgin America is a reliable and stylish carrier with great IFE but for the high prices they are charging the in-flight service could be better.

### Virgin America customer review
Flew LAX to PHL with Virgin America for first time. Was very pleasantly surprised at how comfortable the flight was. I was not expecting Virgin to be such a great airline to fly with. I came equipped with plenty to entertain myself for these flights and found that I was not checking the time and waiting impatiently for arrival since I was comfortable and there was plenty to hold my attention with TV and WiFi. I always look for most economical flights and am disappointed when Virgin America is not one of them. I will fly Virgin to FT Lauderdale from LA this June and very happy about this. They will be my first choice from now on.

### Virgin America customer review
Portland Or to LAX to ORL and it was one of the best economy flights I've taken in the US. The attendants were more than accommodating seats very comfortable and the aircraft was clean and seemed to be larger than other airlines. The flight crew were very nice. I will fly Virgin every chance I get.

### Virgin America customer review
LAX to Las Vegas. Flight to Las Vegas delayed 2 hours due to 'mechanical problems'. On the return the flight was delayed 2 hours again. I was told again that it was mechanical problems. I called customer service and was told that the delay was due to weather. Asked if I would be refunded my fare if I decided to drive home because I could not be home as late as my new departure would put me at. I was told no refund but they would agree to waive the $100 cancellation fee. When we landed in LAX and the pilot apologized for the delay and told us that all flights had been delayed that day.

### Virgin America customer review
I thought American and Delta were bad but Virgin America took the winning cup as of May 5th 2013. First flights were delayed for more than 2-hours with no clear explanation no compensation no remorse! I had to wait over an hour for my luggage? VA decided to mix all the luggage for passengers from SFO LAS and Boston! In order to find your luggage one had to go from one carousel to another. No announcements were made as the employees themselves did not know were the bags would be. My husband and I were on 2 different flights I did not leave the airport until 10pm Los Angeles time. For someone that should have arrived at 6pm! My husband's flight arrived at 1.45am for someone that should have arrived at 10:30pm.

### Virgin America customer review
We had significant delays on both legs of our round trip. We paid more money for an earlier flight which ended up becoming the last flight out. We flew round trip from Las Vegas to Seattle with stop in San Francisco each time. They would not accommodate us with transfers to another flight. A few of the members of the terminal crew were boldly rude. This doesn't speak for all members as one nice crew member consoled us and apologized for her co-worker's behaviour. We had a very lousy travel experience.

### Virgin America customer review
Flew IAD to LAX in economy. Good seat size wider than other airlines at 19.7 however seat pitch was 31 which is about average. It's slightly different than other airlines in that you have to use the touchscreen to order food or drinks and the FA would come in to your seat with your order. The plane A320 was modern. The IFE system included excellent channels and wide variety of music. Compared to other major carriers like United American and Delta Virgin is superior when it comes to in-flight services.

### Virgin America customer review
LAX-SEA roundtrip. I travel to Seattle on business 3-4 times a year and ever since Virgin America began nonstop service on this route it's been my preferred airline. The service is professional seats are comfortable food and IFE are superior and when things do go wrong the staff are much more forthcoming than Alaska or United.

### Virgin America customer review
From San Francisco to Las Vegas. Flight was very smooth. Served soft drinks. No delay at all. Cabin crew were helpful and hardworking. Nice journey for me. Flying time was only 1hr and 20 mins. Cabin design was very modern.

### Virgin America customer review
First experience with VX and I was pleasantly surprised. I only flew between SFO and LAX but the staff and cabin ambience was decidedly different from others and when I needed to change my return the counter staff was delightful. The product is a notch above and the welcomes seemed far more genuine than I have experienced on other US carriers. A good choice.

### Virgin America customer review
Very disappointed with Virgin. Our second flight with them and it was not very good. Flight was from LAX to SEA seats did not adjust credit card sliders did not work on TV so we could not purchase food or movie flight attendants were not responsive. Asked for a headset and was told they'd bring one several times and never did. Never said why just didn't come back.

### Virgin America customer review
The plane was clean and in good condition but on both legs the flight attendants seemed annoyed when you asked them for something. They seemed like they wanted to do the least they could for you and were surprisingly unfriendly. The flight was on time and otherwise smooth.

### Virgin America customer review
I have been flying the SAN-SFO route for over a year now. Compared to the other options I have VA is the best I have flown. Staff are great the terminal (in SFO) is better than most 5 star hotel lobbies in terms of available eateries cleanliness and overall ambience. I have had a couple late flights into SFO - but that can be chalked up to the ridiculous fog cover during the winter months.

### Virgin America customer review
We flew from Ft Lauderdale to SFO. Our seats were at the very back and that was fine. We were delighted there was no one in the third seat until I discovered the arm rests between the seats didn't go all the way up. The steward took a look but was totally indifferent. The beverage cart was passed once in a 5 hr flight. The seats were uncomfortable. That was the most miserable flight I have ever taken. First and last on Virgin.

### Virgin America customer review
SFO-IAD-SFO on 2/6/13 and 2/13/13. Great flights both ways. Early arrivals at both Dulles and SFO. Flight attendants were courteous positive and helpful. Seats were comfortable. Baggage came out on carousel at SFO quicker than I expected or had experienced in the past.

### Virgin America customer review
SAN-SFO. Admittedly this is an incredibly brief (under 2 hour) flight but everything about Virgin America impressed. Flight was cheap but the experience was better than first class in other airlines. Numerous entertainment options (with excellent satellite reception) comfortable seats very attentive staff and in SFO a terminal almost exclusively for the airline. The most pleasant flying experience in as long as I can recall.

### Virgin America customer review
JFK-LAX. Flight delayed by almost 4 hours due to late arrival of the incoming aircraft (due to bad weather). Virgin compensated each passenger with a $50 credit for future travels with Virgin. I was quite impressed as the delay wasn't exactly their fault. I've flown with different domestic airlines and I found that Virgin has the friendliest and most helpful flight attendants. IFE is ahead of other airlines. I also love the cabin ambience and mood lightning. Highly recommended.

### Virgin America customer review
We flew to Fort Lauderdale in December from Los Angeles round-trip. The new A320 aircraft's are very nice although a little small for a 5-6 hour journey. Return flight delayed extensively as staff were shuffling luggage from the aircraft belly to the overhead bins all in the name of aircraft balance and safe takeoff. The ritual lasted over an hour and not called for at all. The staff and attendants seemed cranky. Flights should not be overbooked and luggage balance issues should be solved outside the aircraft. Furthermore attendants and crew should be less cranky on a four star airline.

### Virgin America customer review
Flew from SFO to Orlando with family including my disabled parents. Crew on flight from SFO to Orlando were excellent. However I was very disappointed with the entertainment options were very narrow and you had to buy everything false advertisement when they say you can watch Youtube. You can't they only have a very select videos and you have to buy every film you want to watch. On return from Orlando the crew were rude. Expected to pay for blankets however they didn't come to ask if we wanted to buy them or not.

### Virgin America customer review
New York (JFK) to Vegas. Best airline I've flown on (domestic or international). Very comfortable seats. Onboard has a nice modern look to it. Great entertainment system. You can order your snacks on a screen in front of you. You can pull out your laptop pay for satellite Internet (which works) and be connected the whole flight. Overall a fantastic airline.

### Virgin America customer review
Flew ORD-SFO-LAX going out LAX-SFO-ORD going back. Longest layover was 3 hours. Seats were very comfortable on an A330 very nice retro look to the plane. Excellent customer service good value for the money. Both on the ground and on the plane VA staff friendly and helpful. Would definitely fly again.

### Virgin America customer review
San Francisco to Washington DC in main cabin select Row 5 and back on same route 5 days later. The Red touch screen is far advanced over other US airlines. The ability to open a tab for meals snacks and entertainment selections make Virgin in a century beyond their domestic competitors. The service was excellent and on time departures and arrivals made the trip even better.

### Virgin America customer review
The only way you could enjoy flying this airline is in the few first class seats. Regular seats are miserable and with three seats across terribly inconvenient for bathroom breaks. Only two bathroom locations - one in front for first class only and one in back for everyone else. When first class is "fed" the entire plane fills with the smell of their food and the only food everyone else can get is overpriced and unhealthy. The most miserable flight I've ever taken. I will not be a repeat customer.

### Virgin America customer review
Main cabin select (front row economy) from LAX to Seattle. Full flight but handled well by crew. Like the touch screen ordering of snack type food and drinks. Plenty available. Economy select are emergency exit and front economy seats resulting on more leg room. Worth the money if you get a good deal. Seat comfort okay.

### Virgin America customer review
SAN-SFO-SAN in Main Cabin Select. Flight out was on A319 and flight back was on A320. Both planes were new and clean. Check-in at both airports was fast and easy with priority lanes. Priority lanes for security at both airports provided. Priority boarding honoured. Cabin crew generally friendly. Ample legroom in MCS with free AVOD food and beverages. No hot meals available on short flights. Mood lighting upon boarding was interesting but definitely made it harder to see seat numbers especially on evening or night flights. Both flights generally on time. Can't comment on luggage delivery as I only had carry-on. Overall a great product and definitely the best domestic US airline out there. It's a shame they don't have their own lounges but they'll probably be my first choice for flights in the US and they offer great value for money too.

SFO-IAD-SFO on November 2 and 4. Great service from the staff both on the ground and in the air. While there is food for purchase in the main cabin there is a good selection. The roast beef sandwich is really quite good.

### Virgin America customer review
PHL-SEA return via LAX. Pleasant flight attendants calming mood lighting and easy-listening music in the lavatories during flight. Although some of the hi-tech features on their seat-back entertainment system are not available yet there is certainly enough to keep one occupied and I can no longer accept doing a cross- country flight on any of the other "greyhound of the skies" US domestic services.

I flew round trip on Virgin America from IAD to SFO. What truly pleasurable trip. Love the comfortable seats the entertainment system and the staff. After the abuse I have suffered on several other airlines recently Virgin America is going to be my first choice from now on.

### Virgin America customer review
SFO-JFK. First class on A320. The check-in time was fast and efficient. The clubhouse lounge was nice and clean. Good selection of food and drinks. Flight attendants were OK for the flight. Seat was soft and comfortable. Entertainment system was a little complicated but had a good choice of movies. I slept for a bit but felt a little hard to sleep because it is a cradle seat. Food was good and their was a nice selection of drinks. I would recommend VA but I would suggest that they lower the price for First class a bit.

### Virgin America customer review
LAX-SFO. The best airline for domestic flights. The IFE is expansive which includes the local channels and WiFi. Highly recommend.

### Virgin America customer review
Boston to Los Angeles with my two boys. One has a peanut allergy and although I don't expect accommodation just for him I was surprised that I was basically ignored yet other airlines always provide a "buffer zone" as well as a peanut-free environment. We were not informed our seats did not recline. Having a medical implant in my neck and a head rest that couldn't be adjusted I was in pain. There were 3 empty seats behind us. My boys moved to them because they were so uncomfortable. I was about to join them but they were told by one of the flight attendants that they couldn't sit there. Apparently they each cost $129 more and I would need to pay $387 to have seats that reclined. The seats were empty but still given my situation I wasn't allowed to sit there with my boys who were very upset. What I cannot accept is the fact that a man in my row sneaked to the same row across the aisle and sat there the whole flight for no additional fee. In my 60 years of flying I have never encountered such a rude flight team. I will say the plane was upscale and clean but who cares when it severely lacks in humanity.

### Virgin America customer review
Very good airline and my favorite for domestic travel. I am a 2 million mile flier on United and I have now switched to Virgin America. I have flown seven round trips this year on Virgin. The food is very good compared to any other US domestic airline. The entertainment is fantastic. There is WiFi. The seats are reasonably comfortable. Although it does suffer from the same horrifically small legroom in economy class it is better than the majors.

### Virgin America customer review
LAX-MCO-LAX. The planes are new crew friendly and the seats wide. This trip was the second time flying with them and have been impressed with the service.

### Virgin America customer review
Four members of our family used Virgin America for our return flight from San Francisco to Chicago. Included in our party was our 81 year old mother who uses a walker. She always gets a window seat for the least possibility of the need to move. The flight became unbearable when 5 passengers from the back came to visit with the 3 passengers seating directly in the row in front of us. As they ordered several rounds of alcohol they begin cursing. What made matters worse is that when we complained to the steward they suggest that we move to the back of the plane and that there was nothing they could do. Due to our mother's condition we were unable to move but they continued to bring the rounds of alcohol to the party in front of us. We felt like we were in a bar our fight was from 7.45pm to midnight central time and our mother had to endure 3 hours of torture. We will never use this airline again.

### Virgin America customer review
Trip from IAD to SFO was canceled resulting in missing all connecting flights with a partner airline. The partner airline (Air New Zealand) was a good deal more helpful in sorting out the mess than VA was - clearly staff are not trained for unforeseen circumstances for though they seemed to keep it together when things were running smoothly they fell apart as soon as things weren't. Faced with an angry stressed-out mob of people staff couldn't project the kind of authority and knowledge necessary to calm nerves. The agents on the phone were worse. It took me five tries to get the documentation I needed for my insurance claim which has yet to arrive. A canceled flight is bad enough; incompetent handling afterwards is worse.

### Virgin America customer review
Short flight Las Vegas to San Francisco. Very comfortable seats in Economy. I enjoyed being able to watch ESPN coverage of the Open during the flight. Very short check-in queue at Las Vegas (other airlines nearby has long lines). A pleasant experience.

### Virgin America customer review
Quick flight from Portland OR to San Francisco and back. Excellent staff they were genuinely nice but not overly scripted. Plane was very comfortable and entertainment is the best I've experienced.

### Virgin America customer review
Flight from IAD to SFO on July 26. Baggage check-in was efficient. Counter staff were friendly. Aircraft was clean. Flight attendants were friendly and helpful. I was particularly impressed by their attentiveness to the unaccompanied minor (about 11 years old) who was seated on my row. Food was good (had a roast beef wrap). Seats were comfortable for me (I am not particularly tall). My one gripe was with the "red system" satellite TV - it had spotty reception and then no reception. The rest of the system (music movie etc.) worked fine so must have be a Dish Network issue.

### Virgin America customer review
Checked baggage three pieces for two people were sent to Chicago instead of to Manchester UK resulting in three days of vacation without clothes. We had no carry on baggage. In SFO we booked baggage through Las Vegas on to Virgin Atlantic. Plane was clean and on time going and coming. Ticketing agent in Las Vegas on the 19th was rude and wrong. She said one bag was 10 lbs over. That bag had been weighed by Virgin Atlantic and our personal scale and was not. Finally a man came to our aid and re-weighed it and found that it was not overweight so we did not have to pay for it.

### Virgin America customer review
First time on Virgin. Cabin was attractive seats comfortable and real time TV. In addition the poorest selection of flight attendants - no one smiled. They looked like they didn't want to be there. On a 4 hour flight beverages offered once which must be mandatory or else nothing would have been served. The worst of the two flights was from SFO to ORD. The movie offering was unique until I see a movie that was for mature audiences being viewed in my aisle. I could never risk that when flying with my whole family. I will not be a repeat flier with Virgin America.

### Virgin America customer review
SFO-PHL direct flight. Checking-in is a breeze using their kiosks and staff were proactive in helping everyone check-in (but watch out for those baggage fees). Seats were ok being they were a little cramped but they are made of comfortable leather. IFE gives you free music satellite TV (20 channels) as well as movies and TV episodes to purchase (but they were very limited). There are also various games for the kids and you could even chat with other passengers through your TV. My biggest complaint was that my IFE unit kept freezing and crashing during the flight plus the buttons are hard to press as well as very small. There is WiFi however it can cost as much as $20. Staff were friendly and helpful and offered to charge my iPad when our power socket did not work. I didn't purchase any food or alcohol but non-alcohol drinks are free. In short: Pros: Leather seats satellite TV music helpful staff relaxing cabin lighting fast check in. Cons: IFE crashes power sockets don't work lots of fees for wifi food alcohol and baggage.

### Virgin America customer review
MCO-SFO 7/11/12. Not sure what I was expecting from this flight I guess being English I expect a 5+ hr flight to be treated as long haul and the service to match. Surprised when I saw they were using an A320 on this route by the end of this flight I struggled to straighten out. If you're over 6 feet tall I'd recommend paying for additional leg-room. Other than the leg room the seats were comfortable and the interior of the plane was very trendy. Mood lighting and condensation keeping the cabin relaxed with music whilst boarding gave a relaxing ambience. Entertainment system was impressive with a large range of on demand TV and movies (albeit at a charge). Being able to use the entertainment system throughout taxi take off and landing is a nice sensible approach. WiFi is pretty good and fast seems a little overpriced but it is a very fast service compared to other airlines carrying this feature. Main disappointment was that nowhere on my reservation did it mention there was no meal or snack provided during the flight so having boarded hungry I only managed to last 3 hours before purchasing a meal. Meals come as a large snack box which is very competitively priced at 7 dollars. Free soft drinks is a nice touch but alcohol is overpriced and being able to order drinks on demand from your seat is also handy when you're settled. Generally cabin crew were friendly and the pilot giving his announcement stood in the cabin adds to the edgy nature of end airline. Dressed down uniforms and a relaxed approach is a little different to other airlines but I think Virgin have found a good balance. All in all I would use them again but I wish they'd make a few of the inflight charges more obvious prior to ticket purchase. And 5 hours is a bit too long to be in such a small seat!

### Virgin America customer review
JFK to LAX in Main Cabin Select (Premium Economy). Flight time 6 hours. Priority check-in and boarding which is standard for PE however the added bonus of priority security was great. The cabin has purple mood lighting and leather seats - a nice change from the standard aircraft interiors of other US domestic carriers. Drinks and food can be ordered on your individual entertainment screens. Being Main Cabin Select all food and drink is free. I had a turkey sandwich which was very nice followed by pringles. Drink selection was very good - wide range of alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages. Impressed to see Glenlivet scotch whiskey on the menu. Cabin staff were friendly and attentive. Entertainment options were solid. Overall a very positive flying experience - V America are a step above US and Australian domestic airlines.

### Virgin America customer review
SFO to Fort Lauderdale main cabin. Bags dropped off quickly friendly agent. Boarding efficient people try to cram too many bags on to avoid paying $25 a bag for hold. Very friendly throughout cabin immaculate and brand new feel. TV good quality my regular headphones worked fine. Bought a rum for 6 bucks but water free and available throughout. Very impressed with the whole thing highly recommend! Lots of leg room even when seat reclined in front I'm 5ft 10. Cabin a bit cold but I like that. Bring a wrap or shawl.

### Virgin America customer review
DFW - SFO and SFO - LAX. Brilliant airline civilised staff at check-in and in the air great value in economy seating and superb in-flight entertainment including the ability to order drinks and snacks using the touchscreen in front of the seat. Wifi service throughout the flight so I could work. Why is this so hard for other airlines to implement? The only thing that didn't work was the USB power socket under my seat and the only thing I didn't like was having to pay for the in-flight movie.

### Virgin America customer review
LAX - Boston (R/T). Both legs exceeded my expectations. Everything customer oriented with comfort and ease in mind. Nice well maintained aircraft professional courteous attendants in flight and on the ground there when you need them. On board entertainment consistent with the modern world and food on demand and of a good quality. If I am offered more nasty one size fits all "snack box"!!! Thanks again Virgin. I'll fly no one else.

### Virgin America customer review
PHL-LAX and LAX-PHL - 6/15/2012 and 6/18/2012 - Check in was fast and the plane itself is great. Love the back seat TV and headphones. Headphones you can buy for $2.00 and they come in blue silver and pink. My girls loved them. The main complaint I have about this airline is that on both trips the flight attendants were rude and unfriendly. Very bad customer service! They should have better schooling for their attendants. This is the first and probable the last time I would travel with them if they don't correct this. Southwest is usually what I fly and their flight attendants are awesome.

### Virgin America customer review
LAX-SFO and SFO-ORD in early April 2012. Positives: check-in service at both airports was very professional. The planes were very clean the seats comfortable and there was more legroom than expected. On the other hand departure from LAX was delayed and there was very little information about the revised departure time and even which gate to wait at. Once onboard we waited for over one hour with very little explanation for the delay. Similarly on arrival at ORD the plane parked for over 45 minutes with very little explanation about when we could expect to disembark. I found that lack of communication to be quite frustrating and quite a contrast to the efficient experience in the air. I would use them again provided the price was right.

### Virgin America customer review
SFO-LAX. Very nice terminal at SFO and efficient boarding process. Onboard we sat at the gate for about 40 min. No word from the pilots/crew on the delay. Crew seemed aloof and didn't really care aside from the drink service. The flight was over an hour late arriving at LAX but the staff didn't seem to notice. I don't know if it is VA thing to keep passengers in the dark about delays flight time arrival time etc but it seems like a policy that assumes their passengers are idiots and won't realize things are behind if they don't mention they are.

### Virgin America customer review
One-way PHL-SFO. Since the airline was still new to Philadelphia the check-in line was completely empty. Onboard they offered noise cancelling headphones. The aircraft itself was new. The seats still pretty comfortable leather seats were a little stiff and wouldn't recline. The inflight entertainment seriously lagged when trying to play any of the games however the music and movie selection made up for it. Finally the staff were not only enthusiastic but they actually took the time to remember and refer to everyone by name.

### Virgin America customer review
JFK to LAX. Airplane was clean and looked good but my husband's seat kept falling into the gentleman behind him and then he had to manually bring it upright. Entertainment system was complicated. The crew were polite however the food was horrible and served cafeteria style. There was apparently a leak through the departure door. My feet were frozen solid. When the attendant was asked she said "hold them up" and laughed.

### Virgin America customer review
Two excellent flights from SEA-SFO then SFO-IAD a week later. SFO-IAD: easy check-in at home an efficient and airy terminal in SFO generally happy and helpful employees and a variety of entertainment options. I print boarding passes at home and don't check in luggage so I can't comment on the airport check-in process. My only gripe is the practice of blocking aisle and window seats from advance seat selection essentially forcing the customer to pay extra for "premium" or exit row seats. On both flights I managed to change to window seats so I know the airlines are deliberately blocking them in the hopes of generating extra revenue. Employees are aloof.

### Virgin America customer review
Round trip from LAX to JFK. In both cities the check-in and boarding procedure was confusing and chaotic with extremely long wait times. There appears not to be enough ticket agents. They are really cutting corners with customer service. While I was waiting in the ticketing line for 45 minutes an agent kept warning us that the plane gates would close 10 minutes before departure. Yet there was no concern for getting the line to move faster. It was very disorganized boarding the plane and we could not hear the agent's instructions. Employees are aloof.

### Virgin America customer review
San Francisco to San Diego in so-called "First" class. Compared to other North American carriers much newer airplane and better seat. However nothing special if you apply international standards. Only 3 guests in First but dedicated stewardess preferred to read a magazine rather than pay attention to customers we had to press the call button whenever we wanted anything. Flight was around 90 mins but 30 mins before landing they stopped serving alcohol. Snack platter was lovely for this short flight but drinks pretty cheap and nasty.

### Virgin America customer review
Flew 'main cabin select' from LAX to SFO. Flight was delayed. Seats were reassigned due to equipment change even though it was the exact same configuration. Main Cabin Select includes dedicated overhead compartment. We boarded ahead of the rest of the main cabin and put our blazers in the overhead compartment. Flight attendant told us it was a full flight and our coats had to go on the floor in front of us. (What happened to “dedicated overhead compartment?”) Flight attendants were aloof and came across as uncaring even on a 55-minute flight (that was delayed over 3 hours).

### Virgin America customer review
PSP-SFO-LAX overnight in San Francisco. On each flight ground and cabin staff were friendly professional and considerate. Seats were comfortable and I found many no-cost entertainment options. Non-alcoholic drink service was good in that they leave the drink can or give a generous filling as opposed to my previous experiences on similar carriers. Aircraft was well maintained and the ambience soothing with the cabin lighting.

### Virgin America customer review
The best US domestic airline service available. Family flew Chicago to Las Vegas via San Francisco return. Staff pleasant and helpful at both ends. Interior of plane was new and clean. Entertainment system in seatbacks is superb - some movies and visuals are pay per view but the entire music selection is free. It's good to order food and drinks from your seatback and have them delivered to your seat. Staff wear interesting uniforms and pilots greet on arrival and departure. They offered the cheapest fares for the route and San Francisco is a fabulous airport in which to spend a couple of hours.

### Virgin America customer review
Roundtrip BOS to SFO. Plenty of leg room. Inflight entertainment was very good. Really enjoyed the Sat TV and the on demand shows and movies. Flight crew were polite and helpful. Free soft drinks but no free food not even nuts or pretzels. Got in about 30 minutes early going out and on time coming back. Their prices were lower or comparable with other airlines.

### Virgin America customer review
DFW to LAX. Great flight. Crew friendly and enthusiastic. First class seat very comfortable. Lots of personal space for a domestic cabin. Food of high standard. Overall a superior product when compared to most of the US carriers I have previously flown.

### Virgin America customer review
Outbound SFO to Ft. Lauderdale was fine. Most staff seemed like they'd rather be anywhere but at work. Seats were comfortable. Leg room fine. Entertainment system good though not yet fully functioning. 1 beverage service in 5.5 hours. Return crew mostly had same dullness. Handset for entertainment system was unusable. No sympathy or offer for complimentary headset to use other features. Poor sound quality for emergency instructions. Air conditioning did not function properly. I will avoid this airline whenever possible until staff are better trained in customer service.

### Virgin America customer review
BOS-SFO direct. Could be worse could be better. Pretty good leg room seats uncomfortable. You have to pay for: all food most drinks all movies TV on demand headphones checked luggage. Free: sodas coffee and tea water satellite TV games music carry-on luggage.

### Virgin America customer review
DFW to SFO. I loved the fact you could watch TV and use the Wifi without having to pay extra. I also found that the personnel at the check in counter along with flight attendants were more pleasant than any I have encountered. The only issue that I found with Virgin America is that it does not fly everywhere. I had a connecting flight from DFW to Austin with American and they were not able to handle my bags so I had to re check in and go through security again once I arrived to DFW.

### Virgin America customer review
LAX to DFW. Delayed 2 hours due to weather disrupting schedules. The departure gate was chaotic as passengers were asked to check cabin bags as the flight was full and cabin space was at a premium. Boarding was uneventful and the first class cabin is roomy seats are large and comfortable. Great recline particularly for long domestic sectors. IFE easy to navigate and a good selection of programs. Meal was tasty and the crew friendly and efficient. My concern surrounded the check-in staff checking your mobile while checking in passengers is not professional. Priority tag was not attached to my luggage which I discovered after waiting for my luggage in Dallas. Virgin America offers a great inflight product but their ground crew and reservation system must be addressed if the virgin brand is to represent a consistent product across all their subsidiaries.

### Virgin America customer review
ORD-SFO. Flew priority select to SFO return in economy. Plenty of leg space in priority select. Snacks meals and drinks can be ordered at no cost using video screen. Once flight attendants made initial run through they were quick bringing drinks and snacks. Seating in economy comparable to most airlines snacks charged at usual airline costs and the selection less than in priority. Planes were new which is much appreciated after flying the old tubs American and Delta fly.

### Virgin America customer review
SEA-SFO-DULLES on Jan 5. First leg delayed nearly two hours with no explanation and I nearly missed my connecting flight. Upon boarding the flight attendants were cheerful but the seats and carpet weren't properly cleaned - I saw crumbs on several seats. The second leg was a red-eye flight and the flight attendants were less cheerful more distant and arrogant. I tried ordering drinks on two occasions using the touchscreen system but the drinks never materialized. While other airlines like Alaska and Delta are stepping up their game - especially in customer service - VA seems to be falling behind.

### Virgin America customer review
Flying JFK to LAX in "aim select" their business class cabin. Being in 3d had to walk to the back of plane for bathrooms as business class had none. Got a fever onboard and flight attendants could not offer anything not even a blanket. If I go budget from now on I will stick to Jet Blue. Terminal at JFK is a reminder to the same terminal as it was in the 60's the international arrivals building. Virgin counter is on the opposite end of vast terminal where security check-in is.

### Virgin America customer review
Flew Dec 26th JFK-Las Vegas. Two adults and 3 teenage kids. Boarding was early and as there were lots of families with young kids onboard total mayhem ensued with people trying to swap seats. FA's just stood aside and did not try to help or organize anything. Leg room was ok but the seats were thin uncomfortable cramped and short in the legs and I'm 5' 10. The inflight entertainment was good with a decent sized screen but many options were not available free of charge. Soft drinks are provided complimentary though no food was provided FOC it has to be ordered from your screen. Flight attendants were young but generally quite distant and a bit arrogant.

### Virgin America customer review
LAX to DFW in seat 10F return in seat 20D. Booked regular economy but when checking in online offered an upgrade to Main Cabin Select. Flight attendants smiling and walking up/down the aisle asking what they can do for you. For the return no upgrades available but the economy leg room was at least 1-2 inches more than AA Delta or United. Ambient lighting and sound leather seats and plastic seat backs with clean trays. Baggage pickup in LAX was fast. Personal video monitor for music TV movies etc. Food was a step above some other airlines.

### Virgin America customer review
LAX to JFK via connecting flight in SFO. Seats were okay flight was noisy all but the few passengers in first class are forced to use two bathrooms in the back which made for long waiting times and lots of people going up and down aisles. A lot of effort into having a trendy ambience but not attentive to efficiency and actual customer service. Upon boarding the leg from LAX to SFO we were notified that the cabin was full and they would need to start gate checking carry-on bags. However instead of bringing the gate checked bags back to the gate on arrival they sent them to the baggage carousel at SFO. Normally this would just be a detour and inconvenience but in this case I only had 20 minutes until my connecting flight boarded. A security guard told me my bag should've been checked to my final destination - if I had not checked with the airline desk I would've flown to JFK only to find my bag had been left in SFO. Overall this experience demonstrated poor organization and procedure with gate checking bags and poor customer service when problems arose. And on another note other airlines are already doing mobile device boarding passes to expedite checking in - not sure why Virgin doesn't do this when it otherwise tries to have a trendy and modern image of its airline.

### Virgin America customer review
LAS-SFO on Airbus A320. Boarding was far too early and disorganised for a plane this small. Having said that the flight did leave about 3 minutes early. Leg room was generous but the seats were a little thin cramped and short in the legs. The inflight entertainment system was good with a decent sized screen though many options were not available free of charge. Drinks are provides complimentary though no food was provided. The flight attendants were young but generally quite rude and arrogant. The cabin ambience was comfortable flight arrived early due to good weather. Overall easily the best airline in USA.

### Virgin America customer review
BOS-LAX. My wife and I travelled to Los Angeles. The flight crew were happy and sincere. They cared about the jobs and were happy to answer any questions. Each seat had their own 8" monitor to watch TV movies listen to the radio Videos on Demand view a GPS of the plane and weather conditions and to order food (great selection). All payable with a credit card on your monitor. The plane was clean and comfortable. The trip west arrived 30 minutes early. The flight back to Boston was just as pleasant but quicker.

### Virgin America customer review
LAS-SFO. Probably the best domestic business class flight we've had. From the ground service to the service in the air everything was good. Food was great as was the IFE.

### Virgin America customer review
Boston to LAX. Coach was small and cramped. All bathrooms were in the rear of the plane with a line most of the time. The plane had mechanical issues and had to return to the gate for repair meanwhile people that were late were allowed to sit on jump seats because their seats had been given away. There were issues with the electric outlets for computers and the food ran out in the first hour. No place to stand and stretch and many screaming unhappy children onboard. The return flight was a little better but not much.

### Virgin America customer review
LAS-SFO-half empty plane on a Tuesday. Loved the leather seats 32" seat pitch was okay because seats are thin and comfy. Lighting was cool. FAs friendly and not seeming bored serving in the back of the plane.

I was travelling with family and we were late. The ticket counter reps at Virgin America did a great job. They helped get my family (wife and 2 small ones) on board and set me up with a later flight with our luggage (we were too late to check the bags). They were very friendly professional and helpful. Plane has comfortable seats leg room (even in coach) and the individual screens make flying a joy. The fares we had were very good as well.

### Virgin America customer review
JFK-SFO. Most disorganized boarding I have seen in years. So many people in toilets that we missed our pushback and delayed 1.5 hrs. FA did nothing about it until last 30 seconds with an impassioned plea to get into seats which failed. The PPV system and food ordering system failed as is often the case other passengers told me. The new Internet with Virgin owned laptop failed. FA's tried but there was no leadership. The service manager was the most disorganized of all and when I asked why she replied she didn't know the back as she usually worked in the 8 First Class seats.

### Virgin America customer review
Food ordering system from the screen was down. Heard the flight attendant saying she disabled the system for a break. You have to pay for your first checked bag. Red Entertainment system great with plenty of movies on demand. I don't really care for the mood lighting wifi on every flight but it didn't work either.

### Virgin America customer review
JFK-LAX in Economy. Uneventful flight - very punctual but you have to pay for everything. A good budget airline with innovative ordering from your screen. Crew cheerful baggage available reasonably promptly. I would use them again but may prefer the First Class cabin to experience the whole thing.

Virgin is a very good domestic choice. Staff are friendly smart and helpful. People seem to take pride in their work and have helped with every concern I have had. Their Economy product is very good quality yes you pay out of pocket for everything but it's worth it.

LAX to DFW. The plane a new A320 was pretty full. The crew were very good. Great entertainment system with wifi and satellite TV. You could order snacks and drinks from your seat via the IFE system. Nothing was too much bother for the staff. A nice touch was the Pilots coming out of the cockpit at the end of the flight to thank everyone for flying with them.

### Virgin America customer review
Flight from Orlando to San Francisco. First time flying with Virgin America. The aircraft was an A320. Well maintained extremely clean not a single piece of trash or anything on the ground. I love the IFE you can just select a movie and watch it. You also have music games and live TV available. Food was great and the flight attendants were fantastic. I especially like the RED system where you can select something that you want to eat or drink and a couple of minutes later one of the flight attendants brings it to you. It's great value for money and I definitely recommend it to anybody who considers flying with them. I am 100% positive I will be flying them again.

### Virgin America customer review
Fantastic experience on both legs A319 Las Vegas-NYC and NYC-LAX on A320. Clean newish planes mood lighting comfortable leather sets and decent legroom on a domestic route. Was very impressed with the captains speech in full view of passengers solid service and the ability to order snacks throughout the seat through the RED system. The IFE was more than generous with numerous free programs and fairly recent movies to purchase. Friendly ground crew at all locations and the male FA's were far more restrained than the Australian FAs we get with Virgin Australia. Americans finally get a domestic service that Australians have had for years.

### Virgin America customer review
SFO-LAX-SFO. First time flying Virgin America and it was a great experience. The website was simple and easy to use. The FA's were extremely courteous and polite and the pilots were funny. The A320 had great legroom the cabin was well maintained and the IFE was had lots of music movies games and live TV. On the way back I asked to be put on standby for an earlier flight and the gate agent did it for me in a polite and respectful manner none of the nonsense you get from United or American. And considering the price they offer I definitely will fly Virgin America in the future.

### Virgin America customer review
What a great experience! I flew from SFO-Orlando Florida. My seat ended up being between two rather large women and the one on the aisle was unable to stand up to let me get to my seat. The steward decided with me that rather than embarrass the aisle passenger we would wait until the plane was loaded and change my seat. I was moved to the front bulkhead seat given a free sandwich for the inconvenience I experienced (which to me was not an inconvenience at all). Well done Virgin America! You took me back to a time when an airline passenger was important and treated very well!

### Virgin America customer review
JFK-LAX Main Cabin Select one way. Allowed two checked bags as it was booked on the same ticket as my international flight on V Australia. Loved what Virgin America offer especially the ability to order food and drink (free on this fare) from the IFE and then it magically comes to you soon after. IFE was also packed with plenty of music and movies etc. Very good experience they offer and present an excellent product.

### Virgin America customer review
SEA-SFO A319/320. Check in and boarding efficient. Flight attendants courteous and professional. I found economy seats comfortable for a 90 minute flight - good leg room. Cabin clean and well maintained. Virgin is a unique product in the US vs the main line carriers.

### Virgin America customer review
LAX-FLL-LAX round trip. Service was top notch with boarding efficiency inflight service food and IFE well above US standards. Virgin America is the only US airline whose premium economy and first class products are enough of an upgrade over economy to be actually worth the extra money on all flights.

### Virgin America customer review
Virgin America just started flying out of ORD so I expected glitches. Not too many tho. Two major things to work on. The system for pre-printing boarding passes kept locking up. Going to SFO was fine returning it was impossible to print out. System kept locking up. Cost me money each time I tried but was never able to do it. Had to have an agent do it at the ticket counter. Seats were roomy enough planes clean.

SFO to FLL travelling with infants. Plane new and clean. Flight attendants professional pleasantly surprised at good amount of leg room. Loved the individual screen for shows and ability to order a beverage from my seat. I'm most grateful for the flight attendant that opened the bathroom door for me and pulled down the infant changing table - as my arms were full of a baby and a diaper bag.

LAX-JFK return. Virgin America straddles a weird and fairly confusing space between full- service and budget but is surely the most innovative airline in the US. So many simple touches - playing music at check-in captain farewelling passengers and explaining delays at the boarding gate instead of check-in staff ordering food from seat-back screen. The legroom is fine by domestic standards but would be tight internationally. My flight over was without incident but the flight back was cancelled. This is where Virgin America completely fell apart. They could not handle the mess of 180 angry passengers trying to get out of New York. Despite sprinting back to the check-in desk it took them 3 hours to get me a hotel and food voucher and they couldn't tell me when I could fly next but said they would call. They never did and it was up to me to contact them to try and get to LAX. There was no communication - we were not told the ticketing system was down - to us it appeared that they were just incredibly slow taking an hour to process each passenger. The airport hotel was excellent and they were able to get me to LAX via SFO less than 24 hours later.

### Virgin America customer review
Flew from Las Vegas and loved the fact I could upgrade for less than $500. The plane was a bit worn but very comfortable. The attendants were very nice. The only complaint I have is the food was by far the worst I've been served on any airline. I pretty much starved as I could not eat what was served. Even the bread rolls were stale and not good. So please whoever is in charge of food service do something about it.

### Virgin America customer review
My partner and I were blown away by the friendliness professionalism and dedication of the cabin crew on this flight. Not only did they present us with a bottle of red wine (signed by the entire crew) to congratulate us on our recent wedding but the head attendant came to the baggage claim to return my jacket which I stupidly left on board.

### Virgin America customer review
JFK to SFO round trip staff professional and friendly. The flight on the way to SFO was only about 70% full which was nice and the flight attendants seemed to take extra time to make sure passengers were happy and were enjoying the flight. I enjoyed the satellite TV and the reasonably priced wifi. On the return flight (a red eye) the check in staff were especially friendly and helpful enjoyed the snack served and managed to get some sleep. The mood lighting is actually helpful. I would even pay a bit more to fly them over other carriers out of JFK.

### Virgin America customer review
JFK to SFO. Booked main cabin select for extra leg room (+ one free case priority boarding priority check in and some free food / drink) - 6 hours before (in the middle of the night) we upgraded to first for $160 each. The money was well worth it due to the luxury of 2x2 seating for the first two rows only. However like a lot of flights you're at the mercy of your neighbours - in our case a mother and child who were loud. 1 hour delay announced at the gate at JFK where staff were indifferent beyond belief. They didn't really know what was going on and in the end we left over two hours late. There were some nice touches- lighting in the cabin music in the rest rooms pilot doing his briefing from the cabin. The flight attendants were very pleasant quite informal and helpful. The food in first wasn't really up to scratch. A salad main dessert. (and free drinks on request) followed by nothing - I'd expect a second snack at least. Although the seat was roomy there were no obvious instructions for the seat and it was trial and error to work out the best config to rest in. WiFi was NOT free and cost $11.95 for a laptop - good value with pretty good speed for 39000 feet. The negative comment really was on safety. A mediocre briefing poor checks of the cabin and lead flight attendant despite making the PA for all electronic items to be switched off continued to use his iphone! Main Cabin select seemed worth the money at the time of booking (and the people in our original seats looked comfy). The upgrade to first was worth every cent for the space though I think labelling the service first (other than the seat) is probably pushing it a bit!

### Virgin America customer review
SFO-DFW return - the best bargain out there. Booked economy and upgraded to main cabin select then upgraded to first class. The upgrade included free meals free baggage wi-fi as well as TV and movies. The most inexpensive upgrade of any airline I've flown. The service was excellent. Since we flew with a handicapped passenger Virgin America made sure wheelchair accomodations were waiting for us at the arrival gates.

### Virgin America customer review
They canceled my return flight from Canada and then acted as if they were doing me a monumental favor by not charging me to change my flight to one that was not canceled. The customer service representative was smarmy and seemed to take some pleasure in my inconvenience. Then they advertised that flight on their website as "sold out" to make themselves look good. The prices are great but only if your flight actually happens.

### Virgin America customer review
LAX-MCO. We originally had booked Main Cabin Select but once we boarded we noticed there were available seats in first class. We asked the flight attendant if we could upgrade and he immediately went to the ticket counter and arranged the upgrade. Within 5 minutes we moved to first class. Needless to say it was one of the best flights we have taken. flight attendant was very attentive to our needs and extremely friendly. They were having an internet promotion at that time so internet was free for everyone not just first class.

### Virgin America customer review
LAX-IAD Red eye. Check-in is terrific security was awful. New plane leather seats. Good food innovative ordering system. Didn't really sleep much. Slightly more pleasant than the United flight though rather be on a 767. Redeyes are all pretty bad.

### Virgin America customer review
LAX-JFK flight. Two of us travelled and paid just under $400 for two for the tickets. When we got to LAX: they charged $25 for each checked in bag. $2 for each in-flight entertainment headphones $8 for each in flight film $10 for the wireless internet $8 for a sandwich. The seats were comfortable and the cabin was great but the corporate policy of this airline is questionable to say the least. I for one shall not be flying Virgin America next time. They pretend to be a major carrier but act like a low cost airline.

### Virgin America customer review
JFK-LAX return and required a wheelchair for the return flight. Personnel at both ends couldn't have been more accommodating - perfect help and service including a stop in LAX to buy food and water for the trip. Seats were comfy enough especially for the very good price legroom could have been better but then it always could and the chicken salad sandwich I ordered in flight was excellent. I would fly with Virgin America again - Virgin Atlantic is another story.

### Virgin America customer review
New York Kennedy to San Francisco economy. Boarding the aircraft I was told that my IFE would not work and I would be compensated. To my surprise it worked perfectly. The cabin was clean meal snack and drink options were a pricey let-down. Because it was the holidays (few days after thanksgiving) there was free wireless as opposed to the usual 8 dollars/month. My seat was comfortable and roomy - cabin had awesome lighting.

### Virgin America customer review
YYZ-LAX First Class. It was Halloween and cabin crew were dressed in costume and quite jovial. Appearance of cabin very clean and crisp. Seat very roomy and electronic controls were great. Cushion on the firm side but quite nice overall. Dinner fine though being in row 2 and having only one choice of meal left was a bit disappointing. Entertainment system great with movies and live satellite TV available. On time departure early arrival. Bags out relatively quickly. Good trip I would fly with them again.

### Virgin America customer review
LAX-YYZ. One of the best experiences I have had with an airline in a long time. The staff was extremely friendly the flight attendants were young and happy to help. The baggage allowance is amazing. The flight left on time and arrived on time if not a little bit early. Large variety of food and drinks on flight. I would definitely recommend this airline and I will choose Virgin America as my first choice in airline to LAX.

### Virgin America customer review
SFO to JFk and back. The staff friendly professional and efficient. The whole process from purchasing tickets to online boarding passes simple food ordering on board was excellent and easy. I was most impressed that the cabin staff was constantly walking through the cabin to relieve passengers of any refuse so the cabin remained clean and there was no juggling of used cups food containers etc. My only difficulty is that while slightly more roomy than some other airlines the leg room is still uncomfortable for anyone with long legs.

### Virgin America customer review
LAX-JFK return. Would recommend Virgin America to anyone - they were great (the only thing I could complain about is the $25 baggage fee but the fares were cheap so it didn't matter too much). New planes with unique mood lighting made for a pleasant flight. Both flights left on time and one arrived considerably early. The service and the food I bought were both good.

### Virgin America customer review
LAX-Seattle round trip the same day. I was seated in the bulkhead premium economy row. Legroom was ample the inflight entertainment worked reasonably well except when the satellite cut out for about 20 minutes on the outbound the food was tasty and the cabin staff were much more engaging and professional than the unionised drones on United or Alaska. The only gripe I have is that the cabin interior has too much white which causes problems with glare when the windows are open. They need to add more contrasting colour to reduce glare.

### Virgin America customer review
IAD-LAX-IAD. Check-in efficient and personable. Cabin crew on both flights helpful and friendly. The RED entertainment system charged $8 to watch on-demand movies on one's little screen - very overpriced but at least this is made up for with extensive free TV music and games options (especially the music - top-notch). Meal options are similarly pricey and sometimes disappointingly small although I can't fault them on taste. Lavatories are slightly roomier than the norm and each seat comes with the great convenience of an AC power jack. For a ticket that was only $20 more than the usual cross-continental cattle cars I had a fab flight with Virgin and will consider them again.

### Virgin America customer review
BOS-SFO-LAX and back. Upbeat staff new aircraft and good service. I think their success right now is the crews are young - it will be interesting to see how the airline does in the coming years as the company ages.

### Virgin America customer review
I have recently flown VA three times FLL-SFO. Check-in is cheerful. The airplanes are new and comfortable non-stop flights and great in-flight entertainment tasty food for sale on board. The flighty attendant service is very spotty and sometimes FA's are quirky.

### Virgin America customer review
BOS-LAX flew Virgin for the second time. Great comfortable leather seats new A320 and tv screens and entertainment on each seat. One problem the cabin crew I flew on a night flight and asked the cabin attendant for a pillow and a blanket. She replied very rudely "Sorry but pillows and blankets are for first class passengers only! Although I had this experience I will fly Virgin again and bring my own blanket next time.

### Virgin America customer review
LAX-SFO-LAX with new A320. Everything on time clean and nice plane friendly staff. I hadn't seen such a good IFE especially in low cost airlines. Easy boarding self-checkin and flight. Price was really low - 100 USD bought 4 weeks before.

### Virgin America customer review
SFO-SEA and return. Virgin America leaves the US legacy airlines in the dust. Clean new A319. Fast check in both trips but shame about the check-in baggage fee. Friendly professional crew. The Captain came into the cabin before the flight departed to make his announcements and was waiting again while passengers left the plane. Very good AVOD entertainment system with very wide range of music and good range of free satellite TV stations and with a standard headphone jack). Comfortable seats with reasonable seat pitch in economy (compared to Qantas or American Airlines). Nice mood lighting in the cabin. Free coffee and soft drinks.

### Virgin America customer review
FLL-LAX and return last week. Everything went smoothly on both flights (return was a red-eye). Operation at FLL very smooth since only 2 LAX and 2 SFO trips operate from there. Even at LAX which appears to be a hub for them everything went smoothly. Cabin staff was attentive to passengers needs and very pleasant. At LAX my baggage actually beat me to the baggage carousel. Would fly them anywhere they go.

### Virgin America customer review
LAX to Washington (IAD) return as our feeder service from Australia. The service was superb staff friendly and flights ran on schedule. The planes are new mood lighting very pleasant. The touch screen video system is fabulous no need to buy movies as the free music and TV provide plenty of entertainment. Great also to find an airline that still provides free tea coffee and soft drinks which you can simply order from your seat using the inflight entertaimment system.

### Virgin America customer review
LAS-SFO return. Fabulous experience even though we were delayed in both directions. Ground staff kept us fully informed when delayed and one enterprising ground agent at SFO started a trivia quiz at the gate to keep us entertained while we were waiting for the aircraft to arrive. I like the violet mood lighting inside the aircraft and both cabin and cockpit crew were brilliant. The free IFE is fantastic on a short flight and if you want to pay for a film you have the choice. Alcoholic drinks and snacks are ordered via your seatback screen but soft drinks are free. Great product great staff and great service.

### Virgin America customer review
LAX-SFO and SFO-JFK. Upgraded Main Cabin to First Class (a pity that you can only do that 6 hours before departure now). The food really isn't up to much but the comfort on a long flight makes it worth the upgrade cost. Both flights left on time and arrived early. Crew were attentive and professional. Boarding was speedy and efficient. This might be a low cost airline but they offer better service than some of the 'full service' companies. For best fares book early.

### Virgin America customer review
I have been both Main Cabin and First Class and yet to try Main Cabin Select. Both products are great. The only problem is that they need to lower the baggage fees for Main Cabin fares.

### Virgin America customer review
LAX-SEA round trip our first flight with our 3 1/2 month old son. We booked 2 premium economy bulkhead seats (Virgin America markets its exit row and bulkhead economy seats as premium economy). The premium economy fare was comparable to standard economy fares on competing United and Alaska. Unlike some US airlines Virgin America does not require babies under 2 to have their own seat. There is a level of courtesy and engagement with the customer among the cabin and ground staff that is not seen among the US legacy airlines. Cabin crew made sure we were comfortable. Flights on time and the bulkhead left just enough space to change a nappy (diaper in USA) on the floor in front of the seats. Virgin America's "Red" inflight entertainment/food ordering system works much better now than it did the first year or so the airline was in existence.

### Virgin America customer review
LAX-IAD-LAX roundtrip first class. Virgin America's domestic first class on its A319/320s is the best among US airlines with the exception of American's LAX/SFO-JFK premium service. The fare was comparable to the competition but superior service makes it better value for the money. The seats don't recline completely flat but go back about 150 degrees. The 58" pitch is generous and in-seat massage function a nice touch. IFE is the best among US airlines with satelite TV programming a selection of 10-15 movies and a nice selection of audio tracks and the ability to customise your playlist and save it for future Virgin America flights. The mood lighting is very good for night flights. Food and beverage service is on demand and the food while in small portions is superior to most other airlines. The flight attendants and ground crew seem to want to please the customer more than those with other US airlines.

### Virgin America customer review
I arranged for my 83 year old Mother to visit me in Los Angeles last week. She is suffering from severe memory loss and needs to be assisted I was taken back in the manner that all the Virgin America staff assisted her needs. From the time she left Fort Lauderdale Florida to her return the Virgin staff was amazing. They kept in touch with me via cell phone to alert me of her arrival here in Los Angels as well as her return to Florida. Beyond just handing her off to a porter to wheel her out the ground personal escorted her personally to her caretaker in Florida at the luggage carousel due to some confusion caused by my mother that caused the airline to be unsure of where the caretaker was. The respect care and humanity showed to my mother was incredible.

### Virgin America customer review
SFO-LAX return. Easy quick and enjoyable. It is refreshing to see this standard of service in the US and on short haul flights.

### Virgin America customer review
I was surprised how convenient and friendly the experience was for us. Although we encountered holiday crowds we were so thankful we weren’t stuck on another airline. The service was exceptional the lines were manageable; and the plane was very comfortable! Virgin America is definitely turning us into loyal customers.

### Virgin America customer review
LAX-JFK was very impressed from start to finish. Check in at LAX was quick and friendly. Boarding was quick. The red-purple lighting on board was a nice change from the usually bright white. Cabin crew were friendly and attentive and the legroom was excellent (we were at an emergency exit).

### Virgin America customer review
FLL to SFO economy. Very good value for money. Great entertainment system no fuss check in pleasant and friendly flight and crew and an impressive system for ordering food and drink on board. By some margin the best domestic flight I've taken in the USA.

### Virgin America customer review
LAX-SFO-LAX. Quick boarding friendly staff. I upgraded to Main Cabin Select both ways and was pleased. Great legroom in MCS and priority boarding with MCS. Although they say on their web site that MCS and First Class get priority security screening this is not true - no separate lines at SFO nor at LAX for priority security screening. Is the upgrade fee worth the price? You do get more legroom and priority boarding - otherwise economy is just as fine for I have flown both classes.

### Virgin America customer review
SEA-LAX-SEA in November. Boarding a breeze. Captain came out and gave his spiel before departure. Flight attendant very friendly and prompt with meal (quite tasty) and drink service. Nice wide seats and IFE kept me occupied the rest of the flight. Return flight check in LAX much better than Seattle. Again no complaints with service in First. Another attentive FA and good meal. Tried the free wi-fi promo with my Netbook and it was pretty slick. Will definitely fly Virgin America again.

### Virgin America customer review
SFO-LAX-JFK. I had high hopes for this carrier and I even flew them an extra leg as part of a connection to see what they were like. The problem with Virgin America is Cabin crew. There was nothing friendly about the flight. I smiled to one of the crew on boarding and he just looked away. There are only 3 members on each flight 2 in economy and the lead flight attendant spends most time in First class. The flight to LAX left 40mins late and just made the connection. Paying $20 for a 10kg bag is a joke and the way the ground crew were witnessed to be treating out luggage will further refrain me from using this carrier. Virgin America were also in no means cheap especially after baggage fees. I flew another Low cost carrier on the return and the difference was amazing. Will not be going near this airline again.

### Virgin America customer review
FLL-LAX. Although the crew were not quite as vibrant as on previous flights they were friendly and efficient. A circumstance which exceeded my expectation was my choice of food ordered on board was unavailable although showed available on the RED ordering system. My order was refunded plus I was offered my choice of menu item at no cost. The refund was expected the offer of a free alternative choice was not expected but greatly appreciated.

### Virgin America customer review
JFK-SFO one way. I flew jetBlue out to Boston drove up to Albany then down to JFK. As you can imagine I was tired. Takeoff was scary I could see the end of the runway while we were still rolling but otherwise pretty good. Plane not so clean found gum on my armrest. Cabin crew did nothing about it. Inflight entertainment good only it kept freezing. Seven bucks for internet access was steep so I decided to watch TV instead. It was OK only signal a little corrupt and couldn't see well. Also not a whole lot of channels. Don't be fooled by their low fares. Once you board you should be prepared to spend about fifty extra for a decent flight.

### Virgin America customer review
SEA-SFO-LAS. I had high hopes for this carrier. Segment to SFO was apparently staffed by an Award Winning Crew but they were not remarkable in any sense and perhaps tired as they weren't particularly cheerful. By the time flight landed in SFO LAS flight had already boarded but connecting gate was nearby. Return trip was extremely unpleasant on both segments. Very loud person in back row talked the entire way to SFO at times using crude and vulgar language. Crew did nothing to quiet the individual and also served him alcohol. At SFO landed at international gate and our connecting flight was far away at the very end of a domestic terminal concourse forcing us to once again go through security. SFO-SEA was noisy as well this time because of the non-stop chatter of the flight attendants in the back. Arrived in Seattle to be greeted by a sign stating that VA had been voted "quietest passenger airline. Though that refers to the noise from the jet itself my traveling companion and I got our first laugh of the evening. I will avoid this airline in the future.

### Virgin America customer review
First class San Francisco to Las Vegas return. And just 100 USD extra! Very modern and fast check-in. Priority boarding take off on time snacks and drinks massage chair and very friendly and efficient staff. Personal feel and great value for money.

### Virgin America customer review
JFK-SFO. Not one person at JFK knew how to handle a cancelled flight! Spent 6 hours trying to rebook! No one could do anything without approval of the supervisor who kept disappearing despite the fact that approximately 100 people were standing on line after 3 hours. In the end I was booked on a different flight than my boyfriend and had to cancel the trip after being told they couldn't do anything about the different flights!

### Virgin America customer review
SAN-SFO. Great check in and upgraded for small cost. Almost the same price to pay for my 2 bags in economy. Seat excellent staff excellent service excellent and entertainment excellent. Selection of snacks not excellent. Captain made an introduction speech from the cabin which I felt was also an excellent touch. Definitely a notch above Jet Blue and Southwest

### Virgin America customer review
SEA-LAX and back. Flying with two toddlers was a pleasure on the way down to LA. Flight crew were friendly and helpful. Return flight was another matter. Woman at check-in not very friendly and seemed to be upset when I inquired about early boarding for children. Flight attendants on the plane not smiling the entire trip or helpful.

### Virgin America customer review
JFK-LAS. The staff were okay not Southwest style of cheerful. I didn't know that I had to pay for food - so $3.50 later for a half can of Pringles I enjoyed the seatback entertainment. I would fly with Virgin again.
