### "surprised how good this airline was"
Paris to San Francisco. I was super surprised how good this airline was after reading all the bad reviews. I flew only with hand luggage so I could do the online check-in and didn't have to go to the counter! During boarding nobody was checking the size or the weight of my luggage! The flight left on time and the staff on the plane were professional, helpful and nice! The plane was normal and I didn't have the feeling the seats were smaller. After 1 hour in the plane we got dinner. It was pasta with chicken, very average but okay we could eat it. Later we got a hot sandwich. There is no screen on the seats but there is a wifi you can log in with your phone and watch some movies. 4 are for free the rest you have to pay for. I slept the most of the time! I would definitely fly with XL Airways again!

### "same as all the other airlines"
Paris to San Francisco. Read the reviews after purchasing my ticket and was quite worried. I’ve flown to Europe multiple times on multiple airlines and this flight was just the same as all the other airlines. Economy seats are the same size as United/Delta. Our flight was several hundred dollars cheaper per person than any other alternative. Yes, boarding is a bit chaotic and unorganized (but that was not that big of a deal to me). Yes, there are no screens on the seats, however, they offer free WiFi with access to their entertainment (on your own device) that includes movies, tv shows, games, and music. They do not have charging in seat so bring your own portable charger if necessary. Food was delicious and they had good options for purchase throughout the flight. Flight attendants were very friendly and provided great service. We sat in the back of the plane with 2 seats together and that was great because the aisles were a bit roomier back there.

### "will not fly with them again"
Not Verified |  My family and I traveled this summer from Austin to Miami, two cities in Colombia, Madrid, France, and New York. We used multiple airlines and took carry-on bags on all of them. We are a family of four, and each of us took a carry-on suitcase. The bags qualified for carrying on in all of the airlines that we used, except for this one. Ridiculous enough, the trip that we used XL airways was an international trip from Paris to New York. At the airport, XL airways had a small compartment to measure the bags that they said the bag needed to fit in, including the wheels. It seems like they were doing this scam often enough because when we were boarding there were three guys ready to take "the bags that people couldn't take as carry-ons" in the plane. The representative told us that it was going to be $100 euros per bag and they took our passports and put us aside with many other people who were going through the same thing we were going through. They pretty much kept us until everyone boarded and told us that if we were going to take the flight, we needed to pay 65 euros per bag and he acted like he was doing us a favor. This was our flight to come home from a long trip, it was really late at night, and we had our six and nine year old exhausted kids with us, so we didn't see any other option than to pay them for the four bags. This is what they have on their website to pay for checked in bags. Also, during boarding time I have never seen an airline as disorganized as this one. There were no lines and they just called everyone at once. Inside the plane, there was no entertainment and the plane inside was very uncomfortable for a trans-atlantic trip. The only bright spot was that the crew was really nice to us, and they served one hot meal during the flight. Do not fly with this airline, they are not worth it, and if it is a family trip, even worse. Here are the measurements that most airlines advertise as carry on: 22 x 14 x 9 in And here is theirs: 21.7 in high X 13.8 in wide X 9.8 in deep. They are not really that much different. We had measured them before we left for the airport, as well as had carried them on several flights previously. I think what they do with the carry-ons is a scam, I will not recommend this airline to any of my colleagues, family or friends who travel quite often. I will not fly with them again!

### "Never again for me"
Not Verified |  Newark to Paris. Worst Airline experience ever. Not worth the small cost savings. We flew from Newark to Paris and back. On both legs of the trip, the boarding process was as disorganized as I've ever seen. On the outgoing trip my seat was broken, as were 3 of the bathrooms. the seats space is unacceptably small. there is no TV entertainment, you must watch a small selection of few movies we've already seen on our phone. The suggested TV shows are even more pitiful than the movies. They charge you for every little thing, like blankets, any drink other than water, they serve one meal per flight, which can only be described as disgusting. The flying times are atrocious because we left Newark at midnight and ended up leaving 2 hours late from Paris because the plane needed maintenance, so we arrived in Newark at mid-night. When i booked this trip, there were a few other airline options that were a little more expensive. Knowing what i know now, i should have picked any other airline. Never again for me. Stay away.

### "They lost my luggage"
New York to Paris. They lost my luggage and didnt return it for 3 days. Try being in Paris without all your meds and clothes! There isnt a worse customer service on the planet. Rude and unhelpful. The most they will reimburse is 22 Euro per day but be prepared to be put through the ringer for it. So far 14 emails and no money. I have sent them more receipts and evidence than you can imagine. I cannot recommend nor will I ever fly them again. Horrible company.

### "Worst experience ever"
Not Verified |  Los Angeles to Paris. We decided to try them for our 13 years old and bought a UM (Unaccompanied Minor ) ticket. Worst experience ever. They do not inform you that they need both parent to fill a release form in order for your kid to travel but they then ask you for it when checking in and refuse to check you in unless you have that form which should have been provided by them for you to fill in in the first place. They do not guarantee that your kid will not be seating next to an adult which is a requirement for UM. They do not provide the parent with a gate pass to safely see his kid get inside the plane. Supposedly against their policy. You get no update from them until your kid lands and himself provide you with updates. So, to all parents, do not use this airline for your kids.

### "never fly this airline again"
Paris to New York. The absolute worst airline I’ve ever flown! If you are looking for a stressful experience book your flight with this airline! To begin with when leaving NY for a much anticipated trip we accidentally brought an expired passport. I know horrible mistake! Since we arrived well ahead of time I thought I’d call a friend to get my current passport and bring it to the airport for me which would take less than 1 hour. The agent at the desk said we must have the passport an hour before take off. He gave me a phone number to call to see what would happen if I didn’t get the passport in time. I called and nobody answered. I told the agent then he said yes well they don’t reopen until 9am so that didn’t help much. My friend got my passport to me about 55 minutes prior to the flight departure time and they refused to let us check in. I was told the check in was closed because the check in staff needed to leave the counter to go downstairs to start boarding. If they had enough employees I would have been in that flight. It gets worse! So we missed the flight then called 9am when customer service reopened and I was told they couldn’t do anything to help me. If I wanted they would sell me new tickets for the same price for the following day. I had non refundable hotel reservations and already lost one night. Was so upset with this airline that I decided to just book a different airline for less money to get to Pairs. In the return trip my experience wasn’t much better! We got to the airport with plenty of time To spare and found XL Airways counter but no employees were there. A sign said they were closed? No further information given! We walked around to find out they were set up in a different spot. Not sure why they couldn’t have put up a sign telling us where to go. Other passengers were walking around just as confused and annoyed as us. After checking in our luggage and weighing our carry on luggage we went to the boarding area. When boarding the plane we got stopped and were told our carry on was too big. I explained that the lady at check-in weighed it for us and said it was under the allowable weight. Then the woman at boarding said no actually your daughters tote is too large. It was a fabric shopping bag with a neck pillow, some snacks and a sweater. I showed her that if you squeeze it, it scrunches up so small and it would have no problem fitting under a seat. She wasn’t allowing it at all. She said if we didn’t pay $100 for the extra bag that we couldn’t get on the plane. $100 for a shopping bag! We flew throughout Europe on several airlines with the same luggage and never encountered this issue! Not even with airlines that have a lower weight limit. This woman stopped another lady at the boarding gate. We couldn’t get on the plane unless we paid the $100! What could we do? We were now minutes before departure and needed to get home. I will never fly this airline again and will not recommend this airline.

### "just not recommended"
Paris to Point a Pitre. My sister and I flex with XL Airways to get to Guadeloupe and then board a cruise ship. The flight was okay, but when we arrived in Guadeloupe our suitcases where not there. A long way of bad communication followed and eventually we did not get our suitcases for the whole trip. Eventually the suitcases arrived in Brussels, while we live in the Netherlands and they refused to bring then to us. We had to get them ourself. We are still trying to get a compensation for the fact we did not have our suitcases for the whole trip (over two weeks) and then waiting months to get them after the trip. They do not respond, offer just a couple off bucks, while airlines have fixed compensations they should pay in these cases. Awful company, bad communication and just not recommended.

### "not consider processing my complaint"
Not Verified |  Hold onto your boarding pass if you want a refund. They cancel flights. The excuse given was the plane hit the gangplank and damaged a wing so a smaller plane was sent. Having 150 passengers in JFK. They knew at 5pm there was an issue yet let us stand in line from 9pm to midnight allowing passengers to board with criteria. It appeared it was who yelled the loudest. They in fact paid three days hotel which is how long it took to get the next flight. And in line many not involved in our error were also carried over from other flights. According to the hotel staff the airline knew at 5pm there was an issue. Yet we were made to stand for three hours. So now they have my confirmation. They paid my hotel, yet I have to prove I went on the rescheduled flight by giving them my boarding pass. A e-ticket from my original ticket is not enough. They know the flight had issues, they paid my hotel, they flew me on another flight. But will not consider processing my complaint without the boarding pass for the new replacement flight.

### "very low cost airline"
Not Verified |  Paris to New York. This is a very low cost airline and believe me it shows. The cabin luggage weight is 5KG, my was 8 kg and the agent was so rude and insisted that it had to be checked. I offered to pay excess baggage and he said check it or leave. I finally got to my seat and there were 2 overhead bins completely empty! I am Global Entry so when I landed I was through customs and immigration within 15 min. I then had to wait 90 min to get my 18" carry on. The aircraft is all coach 400+ passengers almost no empty seats. My bag was one of the very last to come off.

### "it was better than I was expecting"
Punta Cana to Paris. I was sceptical of this airline having read the reviews but there was a limited choice when booking airlines. Overall it was better than I was expecting. The plane was tidy although showing its age a bit. Good news was there was power at the seat. Bad the seats are not very comfortable especially for a long haul flight ok for a day flight but not for a night flight. There is a wifi entertainment system where you can watch entertainment, see info about destinations (which does not have any use due to the limited information) and flight tracking. Of course there is an upgraded option available for 10 EUR. Food was very average. Drink options good but have to pay. Free tea, coffee and water the later being freely available and the cabin crew visited the cabin regularly to top up. Be aware the check-in ques were bad so give yourself plenty of time. Also carry on luggage has a max weight of 5kg with it being checked a lot of the time.

### "It was so unprofessional"
New York JFK to Paris. I would not recommend anyone booking a flight with this airline. Two weeks ago, I had a flight leaving from JFK to CDG on Sunday night. When I got to the airport, there was no one from XL airways there. Over 150 passengers were waiting for a flight that never arrived. The worst part is that I tried getting in touch with the airline in New York and in France and there was no answer. The airline did not even have the decency to send me an email or text that there was no flight. The first time I heard from the airline was Tuesday night informing me that my flight will be leaving Thursday afternoon. It was so unprofessional and honestly appalling. The airline did not value any of the people’s time and did not even care to correspond with passengers until two days later. In addition, I lost money on a flight that I had leaving from Paris to another country.

### "inconvenience so many people"
I was meant to fly out of JFK to Paris. I understand the conditions at JFK Terminal 4 were out of XL Airways' control however what was in  XL Airways control was to inform its passengers of what was going on. There were no email or text updates about the delays in the flight therefore I traveled to the airport at the appropriate time only to find no information and no XL Airways staff. This is is inexcusable to have no reps in person and the only phone number we could reach was a french number which incurred international charges. The only reason I even found the number to call was because other passengers said they had found some announcements on the XL airways website. Why none of us could be informed via phone, email or any representatives in person is beyond me. How hard is it to send one email blast out to all passengers saying "We apologize for the inconvenience, please check our website for updates and we will continue to share news with you as soon as we have it. Thank you for your patience". Again I understand that the weather and the pipe burst are extenuating circumstances however it is within XL Airlines capabilities and responsibilities to communicate effectively with passengers and have a plan in case of such events that severely inconvenience so many people. It is now 24 hours after my flight was scheduled and I have yet to receive any information from them.

### XL Airways France customer review
New York to Paris. This is truly the absolute worst airline. They are unresponsive, incompetent, and unequivocally rude. They do not have representatives at the airport and the staff that they do employ refuse to answer customer's questions. I was scheduled to leave on a flight 2 days ago at 9:30 pm. The flight's gate kept being changed for hours after the departure time until it was ultimately CANCELLED around 2 am. Then, they had us stand in the line waiting for a representative to speak to each traveler individually about rescheduling our flights. We waited in this line until 4 am without anyone being spoken to. Then, they made an announcement that they had hotels reserved for us and that we were just waiting for buses to take us there. An hour later, they noted that no buses were on the way and that there were no hotel rooms reserved. They did not provide us with water or answers/information as to when our flight was being rescheduled to. The staff members insulted passengers calling us rude, disrespectful, and annoying for voicing our concern and frustration. They refused to speak to us and did not answer a single question. We could not leave the airport because they would not release our luggage. After we were forced to sleep on the bare floor of the airport, they said that the flight would be rescheduled to the next day at 7:30 pm. We lined up for check in at 4:30, as instructed. The XL representatives/staff members said that we were "misbehaving" so they chose to delay check in until 6 pm. We finally checked in. The flight was re-listed as being scheduled for 9:30 pm. We waited at the gate until 11:30, when they claimed that they were commencing boarding. We stood in line waiting for boarding until 12:45 pm. At this time, they CANCELLED the flight again. Then, XL threatened to have any passengers that complained or showed anger arrested. They instructed us to go pick up our luggage at the carousel. We went to the carousel, where we waited until 4 am. At 4 am, we were told that no luggage would be released to us, and that no other information would be given. I left the airport. I received an email at 3:00 pm notifying me that the flight was scheduled for 2:00 am the following morning. Then, this flight was also cancelled. 3 flights cancelled. They still have our luggage. They have given us no additional information.

### "seats were terribly uncomfortable"
Flew New York JFK to Paris CDG. Worst airline ever that I have ever flown with. The seats were terribly uncomfortable, there is no amount of perks that can be had that offsets this. I almost thought it was me that was the problem but after flying with 3 other airlines on our European trip it was XL that was the problem. We flew with 3 other airlines and confirmed that XL Airways one of the worst airlines we have ever used. Choice between XL and walking, I'm walking.

### "Value for money is excellent"
Miami to Paris. So reading most of the other reviews I was expecting the worst when I boarded XL Airways. If you have been flying for the last 30 years it is a just like going back to the 90s. No screen with individual entertainment. Pros: Food was good as well as price and staff. Cons: If you want a pillow and decent blanket you have to pay 8 euros for it. It's a low cost airline so what do you expect. Value for money is excellent.

### "attentive and very friendly"
Paris to Los Angeles. I was skeptical about flying with this airline before I booked. I had read prior reviews and the ratings were very low. I felt that I should contribute with regards to the overall service that I received from XL Airways. My fare was excellent. I paid more for connecting within Europe then flying across the world. Crew, attentive and very friendly. I received lunch, dinner and snack, as well as headphones. Basic water, tea and coffee provided with meals and throughout the flight. Anything else, needed to be paid for. I understood that before I booked. It's a low cost airline so basic caffinated drinks and or specialty drinks as well as blankets incur an extra charge. The blanket came in a colorful pouch with a blow up half moon pillow and eye mask, for 8 Euros. Credit cards are accepted onboard. They provided duty free purchases before landing. As for Internet, there was a fee to watch movies and listen to music for 9.95. You needed to download the airlines app before departure. If you didn't want to purchase internet to view and listen to music/movies, the aircraft did have three tv's on the plane, in which they played 3 movies and a travel documentary on a particular destination for the long flight. I found the movies entertaining and family oriented. The seats were comfortable for me but of course just average, it's economy class. So please consider this if you are tall! If you need extra legroom, economy plus for an extra fee is available before confirming your flight. The aircraft was very clean and facilities were positioned properly on the aircraft with several almost available at a time. The last check-in was an hour before departure, so get there early. No exceptions are made and is a strict policy that the airline adheres to. I witnessed two customers that tried checking in 6 mins after the airline closed the check in counters and were still denied check in. As for carry on, strict 5kg allowance, one personal hand bag and one carry on only. If you exceeded the 5kg weight, the bag is checked to your destination but with no additional fee to do so, which is nice. I'll definitely use XL Airways again in the future. I found the airline to be great for the overall. I was very pleased with their services! I have a disability and the crew was wonderful in accommodating me and making sure I had proper assistance before boarding and when we arrived to the final destination. Thank you for a pleasant flight.

### "Worst experience ever!"
San Francisco to Paris CDG. Worst experience ever! My husband's legs (lean built - 5 foot 9 inch) wouldn't fit in! His legs bent sideways. This has never happened in any economy class flights. Vegetarian meal is considered a "special" meal. Its an additional $14 per person. There is extra charge for every little thing ($3-$15) for snacks, soft drinks, chips, cookies etc. Additional charge to book seats beforehand. Husband paid $75 extra to sit in "exit" row. Cabin crew was nice and friendly but a smiley face doesn't alleviate the extreme discomfort. Long lines to get boarding pass. We were in line for an 1 hour 10 minutes even though we reached airport 3 hours early. No seat back TV/screens. No plug point to charge phone/ tablet.

### "the aircraft was dirty"
Paris to San Francisco, the aircraft was dirty, thetable was broken on my girlfriend's seat, no in-seat entertainment on long haul flights so be prepared to have a tablet or other form of screen support. Otherwise you can rent an IPAD from the airline however make sure you ask for one as you sit down since they don't have enough for everyone.. The inbound flight was just as dirty - this time no IPADs to rent as none had been charged up from previous flight, my seat was broken in the recline position and the armrests were broken.

### "really a great experience"
San Francisco to Paris. I was a bit nervous using this airline. I did a ton of research and looked for reviews and couldn't really find reviews base off the experience of their airline. Some of these reviews for XL I feel are from people that expected too much for a budget airline. I read the instructions and recommendations from their website, which I would read entirely to help you have a better experience. When I arrived at the airport I had my boarding pass printed before hand and was quickly greeted by an XL employee. They checked my passport and they checked the weight and size of my luggage. I had to check my luggage in the system, because the weight was too high. Upon boarding I was greeted by a very professional and flight attendants who spoke English and French. They realized I didn't speak French and directed me to my seat. Upon departing they did the standard procedures in French and English for departure. During the flight they provided a blanket, earplugs, water and a free meal! This is a very French airline and the food was very French and flavorful. They were very accommodating for refills of water, tea, and coffee that were free. The airplane itself is older so there is no WIFI onboard for internet. I was not disappointed, because they did provide a free movie and I also had my IPad. I would recommend you take a portable charger for your phone, tablet, or laptop. There are not electrical plugs on the seats for your electronic devices. Throughout the trip the flight attendants were on point and made sure the restrooms were cleaned and that passengers were comfortable. Considering the price I paid for the ticket this is a great value! This is a budget airline and for the overall package this was really a great experience.

### "I am horrified by the service"
If you are tempted to fly with this airline because of the wonderful price do not do it. The flight out to Paris was wonderful. The plane was empty so everyone had their own row to relax. The troubles didn't start until we arrived in Paris. On our flight to Paris they lost our babies car seat. When we went to check in today the lady at the counter was rude and unfriendly. We handed her 5 passports. Three for adults and two children. We had 4 bags to check in a stroller and we had our 2 year olds car seat. We have a double stroller. I was holding our ten month old and our two year old was sleeping in the stroller. In San Francisco they put stickers on all three pieces because the stroller breaks down into three pieces. When we told her that the stroller did that she rolled her eyes and said really. Then we tried to check in our two year olds car seat she said nope you can't take it, or you have to pay for it. When I explained they hadn't charged us for it in San Francisco she said well that is San Francisco. She then called the airline and they said we had to pay 50€ for the seat. She told us we had to go to a separate counter to pay then come back to her. As we were leaving she said wait let me put the stickers on the stroller. As she was putting the sticker on one of the pieces she noticed our daughter and said oh you have another child, we said yes, you have her passport to which she then said oh you don't have to pay anymore. Instead of apologizing she just said your finished. We upgraded to seats 4 thinking they would be wonderful seats because of our previous flight. But the seats had less space than before! They were so uncomfortable! Especially having a twenty pound baby on your lap. There was a section in front of us nobody knew was available. When I finally got the attention again of a stewardess the doors were being closed and she said that I needed to go to the gate to pay. What kind of airline charges for everything other than water, coffee and tea but wont let you buy up a seat? There were 8 seats open! Those seats remained open all flight. Our ten month old was walking back and forth in front of our seats holding onto the seats. We didn't notice but there was an ashtray in our daughters seat. In it was trash with liquid and food. It stuck and was disgusting. Our son put his hand in it. When I asked the stewardess to do something about it, she said you think it's my problem? I said to her I am not saying you own the airplane but you are the only one who's really able to do anything because you have the access to things to clean it. She rolled her eyes at me. 6 minutes later another stewardess came with gloves and took out the trash and in the process got liquid on us and said there I got everything. She went and got a napkin dabbed and said there I am done and walked away. 6th thing, for a couple hours service was non existent. We were trying to make a bottle for our ten month old so he could sleep and we pushed the service button but nobody came for 30 minutes. I am horrified by the service.

### "nice and smiling staff"
Flight Los Angeles - Paris with XL Airways. June 2017. First of all, when rating a low cost airline, I need to compare it to other low cost airlines and not to Emirates for example. When you book low cost, you should know what to expect: you know that for such a low price, you're not gonna have the high quality you want (for that, you go with Air France and pay $1,500 instead of $600). So, that being said, for a low cost airline XL is really good on several points, but of course some are not. Good points: - the free checked-in bag! Yes, that makes the whole difference, because most low cost airlines makes you pay for it, which then drags the final price up. So that was appreciated. The free meals in-flight. We were given full meals in flight. In addition to that, we were given free coffee / tea, and refreshments as well. Only alcohol is in addition. Food quality: good! I will not say amazing, no, but for in-flight food, it's pretty good. Very similar to the food quality you will get in Air France flights. This is because XL Airways is a French airline, so good products. Trust me after this you will be full, but if you want more, they have a menu with French items, delicious. - the staff. The staff was amazing, really. I think the best service I had on a flight. They are not after you to buy things (which I experienced in most low cost airlines). They were so helpful and dedicated. They give you extra bread, and do not hesitate to serve you twice for refreshment when asked. Overall very nice and smiling staff. Negative points - the seats. I would say the seats are my main and only complaint. They are very tiny, and not too comfortable. I'm a small size woman, so it was ok for me, but the poor guy seating next to me had a hard time. His knees were literally touching the seat up front, so not the best for a long haul flight. This is where you feel that you are in a low cost airline in case you forgot, here's the reminder. - the in-flight entertainment. So, they don't have in-seat screens. However, they do have in-flight entertainment through iPads or other devices. You can access their entertainment through your computer, or they rent iPads for $15 (which also include the premium package). Not a big selection of movies, but enough for a long haul flight. Personally, I enjoyed reading a book better, and also download my own favorite series before leaving to enjoy during the flight. Overall: for the price, I will use this airline again. Mainly because I do a lot of Los Angeles-Paris, and the direct flight, with checked in baggage and meals included is just awesome..

### "pleasantly surprised"
I was pleasantly surprised by XL Airways after all the critical reviews. The aircraft from Los Angeles to Paris was clean, the attendants were very involved throughout the 10 hour flight (and were pleasant as well), and the flight itself was smooth. Yes the seats are crammed in there and the entertainment is not great. There is wifi and you can watch movies on your iPad. (They also rent ipad minis for $20 so bring your own!). I read a little and tried to sleep so this wasn't a deal breaker for me given the reasonable fare. If want more leg room, you pay dearly ($70 extra) but this is worth it for me. We left and arrived on time which adds a star. I actually found it a much more pleasant experience than my super expensive Air France flight last year. I would fly them again for sure.

### "pilot did an excellent job"
After reading all the reviews about XL Airways and learning that they have 3-4 planes in their entire fleet, I was extremely anxious. We arrived at JFK 3 hours early and were among the first in line to check in. After waiting in line for an hour, we made it to the counter where our back bags and checked bags were carefully weighed. Thank goodness, we were all underneath the required mass. The plane was boarded and we we got on the electricity went completely out but in a few minutes, we were on our way. The pilot did an excellent job piloting the plane and even though we took off late, we made it close to our normal time. After spending a few days in Paris, we went back to check in to our return flight but they had already boarded and we missed our flight. We tried calling customer service but only got a recording and wasn't until the next day that we found out we would have to purchase a one way ticket home. On the way back after Checking in for our one way flight back to the US, the woman at the counter was not sympathetic just said so sorry. We did make it home safely and once again the pilot did an excellent job. Bottom Line: I would take this airline again but make sure that I made the flight next time because you will not be compensated or offered a discount. By the way, I thought the food served on board was really good! We were served breakfast about an hour before our flight landed in Paris and dinner an hour or so into our flight on the way back.

### "would not recommend this airline"
Paris to New York JFK. The aircraft seemed to be a really old plane, and the TV's were broken (this plane did not feature individual screens on the back of the seats). But the flight itself wasn't the worst flight I've ever been on. The service was ok, and the food was edible. It is, after all, a budget flight. I would also like to mention that the captain did a great job piloting the plane. My issue with XL Airways is their customer service. We had checked in an oversized luggage at CDG, paid the fees, and followed the standard procedures of checking in. When we arrived at JFK, our oversized luggage was nowhere to be found. The staff at the terminal 4 oversized baggage claim counter told us that we just need to wait. We waited for 2 hours before someone finally told us that most likely it didn't make it onto our flight. We filed a claim, and they provided us with a phone number to contact to track our lost luggage. The number is completely bogus. We tried calling during business hours (8AM - 10PM weekdays) after ringing for about 3 minutes, it goes to voicemail, which is conveniently full. We try reaching XL Airways through several means, and finally we manage to speak to a representative. The representative tells us that we need to send an email with a detailed list of the items in the lost luggage. We do so, and wait for a reply. After doing a bit of research, I find a review dated 2013 about a lost luggage through XL Airways from CDG to JFK. The reviewer finally managed to track down their suitcase by going directly to JFK. So we decide to do the same and drove back to the airport to Terminal 4. After speaking to TSA, they tell us to speak to an XL Airways representative at their ticketing counter in departures. We make our way there only to be told that we need to go back downstairs to lost and found. Finally someone from Swissport baggage transport helps us track down our lost luggage, and we finally receive it. Nobody from XL Airways would provide us with any type of information regarding our lost luggage. They have a compensation policy of 20 euros per kilo for lost luggages, which wouldn't have even covered the cost of the suitcase itself. They have zero respect for their customer's belongings, which is completely unacceptable. Furthermore, no one from XL Airways was willing to help us in the least. They kept sending us to dead ends, and it wasn't until we showed up at the airport the following day that we received any answers (none of which came from XL Airways). This review should serve as a warning to anyone looking to fly with XL Airways. They have a 5kg weight limit for carry on luggage, and a 20kg weight limit for checked in luggage. First checked in luggage is free, after that it's 100 euros per bag. They also don't respect your belongings. To them, you aren't a customer that deserves respect, you are just a sold seat. I will never fly with them again, and their aircrafts need to be updated desperately. They should have been out of circulation years ago. I would not recommend this airline. Fly with Air France, they actually treat you like a human being.

### "one of the worst flights ever"
New York JFK to Paris CDG. One of the worst flights ever. Though we are allowed 5kg (yes, only 5kg) of carry on luggage, at the airport I am informed there is no overhead compartment for small suitcases. When I ask for options, instead of answering my question, they take me to the manager, make me wait for 30min and then accuse me of making a scene. When they all calm down, they explain I can use the storage under the seat which is ok by me and I check-in the carry-on. Though the plane simply does not have overhead compartments for the middle section. To avoid issue it is worse to pay to pick a seat on window side. Otherwise, hot flight with zero AC, totally inedible food, service absent, central entertainment is very low quality. Only positive is the price.

### "budget airline with minimal service"
Los Angeles to Paris CDG with XL Airways. This is a budget airline with minimal service. If you can accept no frills service of getting you to your destination then this might be for you. If you are used to full service airlines such as American, Delta, Southwest, United etc then don't take this airline unless you can deal with the following - narrow seats, poor customer service, difficult website, very restrictive baggage weights. We did it. It worked for us. We kept our bags to 20 kg checked (42 lbs) and 11 lbs (cabin) I strongly suggest you buy a travel scale for like $6 from Amazon. We made a mistake and paid extra for the exit row on our outbound flight. Lots of leg room, but the arm rests are fixed and don't go up like in all other rows. This loses you 2.5 inches in width. Having those extra inches helps. Our flight was only 2/3 full and most people don't pay for the seat selection. I suggest you do. Getting pinned into a middle seat or window seat and having to climb over someone on the tight seats is tough. This was the cheapest ticket for the busy summer season at $1120 round trip. My rating is low because service does matter. Website is poor in my opinion. We could not book return flight seats without calling airline since website did not let us do it after we booked outbound flight seats. Our steward during outbound flight was only capable of handing out meals. Had minimal English capability. Overall summary, if you are experienced traveler and need low cost, then this may work for you if you read up on what has gone wrong for others and avoid their mistakes. I hear all the airlines are shrinking seats (I don't travel much anymore), but 17 inch seat width is the smallest I have ever had and was the smallest seat I could physically squeeze my 270 lb body into without having to ask for a second seat.

### "service was really good"
San Francisco to Paris with XL Airways France. I was really concerned after reading all the negative reviews and was pleasantly surprised to have a good experience. There were 3 of us and the money savings was a lot. Since we saved so much, I upgraded our seats to more legroom, very reasonably priced. On the way back, we were able to get an emergency row for the 3 of us, $50 each. The service going and coming back was really good. We had a meal, snacks, coffee, tea, and water free. Of course, there was other stuff for sale like on all flights. Legroom in general is not that different from most of the major US airlines, seat width is pretty narrow. The video entertainment is bad, but they do rent tablets with videos, games and documentaries for €10.00, well worth it. Even with all the extras, it was still a big savings. The worst part of XL is their online booking. It's easy to book your tickets, but if you have any questions, forget getting hold of someone. Reserving your seats - only if your lucky. I was able to book our seats about 3 weeks before our trip from SFO to Paris, but not return. When we went to the airport to check in I asked about getting return seats, they said ask in Paris, they couldnt. Paris said, you can't reserve seats until day of flight. We got to the airport about 2.5 hours prior to flight and easily reserved our seats. On our departure flight I noticed a lot of people angry about an extra charge for overweight luggage. Its shown everywhere what the weight limit is, so we didnt have any issues. The weight limit is very reasonable, 44lbs for a check in bag (no charge) and 5kg which is about 11lbs for carry on. If you've got the money to spend at least $400 and more for each ticket for an airlines with more frills go for it, but I think you would have to pay at least $600 more to really feel the difference. ** WAITING FOR TICKET **

### "no service whatsoever"
Flew XL Airways France from Paris CDG to Miami. The price could not be beat, but you get what you pay for. After they served the meal, about an hour into the flight, all of the flight attendants disappeared for 4 hours. People kept pressing the call buttons and nobody showed up. I kept pressing mine and someone would turn it off after a little while, no service whatsoever. They will not bring you water, you have to get up and get it yourself in the middle area. They don't have TVs but offer tablet rentals. I tried to rent one but they only had 20 or so for the entire flight, so with only a few people ahead of me for one, I didn't get one. I had to sit there bored for 9 hours. Your flight comes with nothing, you have to pay for everything, including snacks, and a blanket. They have outlets under the seats but they don't work, nobody's outlet worked.

### "pay for extra legroom seat"
Flew New York JFK to Paris CDG in May 2015. I would fly them again but take my advice and pay the extra $50 for an extra legroom seat. For the amount of money you save by flying XL Airways over the competitors, the $50 is a worthy splurge. Both flights were on time. Fare was a steal at $700. I haven't seen anything this cheap in years. Staff was extremely professional, both in flight and gate staff. Plane was in good condition. Tiny seats, I am 5'3" and didn't have too much problem. However my boyfriend is 6'0" and was miserable. The passenger in front reclined his seat and was basically sitting in my boyfriend's lap for 7 hours. Their website is horrible - after the first leg of my trip, I wised up and was trying to reserve extra legroom seats on the website but kept getting error messages and ultimately was not able to. This was absolutely infuriating. After all those errors on the website, I tried to call their customer service for help but only got voicemail. Absolutely infuriating. Good luck if you need any help after you book. No inflight entertainment. The power outlet at our seats worked only intermittently. Make every effort to charge your devices before boarding the plane.

### "disregard for customer service"
New York to Paris. Our 9.30pm flight was delayed one hour, without explanation, then another hour and moved to another gate, again with no explanation. Then the flight was delayed another hour or so again, no explanation. Boarding of the flight began, and then the flight was cancelled - without explanation at 11:45 p.m. The staff asked for patience, but no information was given to the passengers until after 1:00 am. The reason for the cancellation was that the airline overworked the flight crew. This is something that could have been determined by 8:00pm, but the majority of the passengers did not get a hotel until 3:00 am due to the overwhelming incompetence of the staff of this airline. They did not assist, offer information, they were rude, condescending and complained to the rightly frustrated customers that we were somehow ungrateful for their efforts to not get us to Paris on Christmas Eve. I've never seen such an impressive display of incompetence, and such rampant disregard for the most basic notion of customer service.

### "20 hours later than schedule"
My daughter booked a one-way trip to Paris. XL Airways France was the clear cheapest ($500 instead of $1800). Before leaving for the airport we checked online that the flight was still scheduled on time. Arriving at the airport it was scheduled with a 2-hour delay. Check-in was fine. We knew they were very strict with luggage size and weight so we had been careful when packing. Eventually the flight boarded on time but the plane did not leave the gate. After waiting for two hours, we were told that passengers were missing and they had to deplane the aircraft and everybody had to take their luggage back. The plane would leave the following day. We go back to the airport the following day. Plane finally left JFK but it did not go to Paris as planned it first stopped in Montreal to pick up crew members. Flight finally arrived in Paris 3 hours later than the revised arrival time (ie 20 hours later than the original schedule).

### "unimaginably rude and unfair"
I purchased 2 JFK-Paris tickets from XL Airways on their site in August 2014, and paid with my credit card. 5 minutes later I received the e-tickets in my email and they were for Paris-JFK. I called them immediately and they told me I should call their booking office in Paris. After getting the runaround to obtain their phone number, I managed to talk to a lady in France and I explained to her that I live in New York and I will be leaving from JFK. I asked her to reverse the itinerary, to make it JFK-Paris. She said there was nothing she could do about it and that she will submit the request to her boss. After many calls, I got from them an email address where I should send my request to correct the itinerary; which I did. After 4 or 5 days they replied to deny my request. However, after calling many more times, they agreed that if I buy 2 new tickets (JFK-Paris) from their site and send them the proof of it (?) they would reimburse me for the erroneously issued tickets for Paris-JFK. I bought 2 new tickets from their site, mind you each at $200 more than the initial ticket price, and sent them the proof of purchase, and they reimbursed me. The day of departure, at check in, they informed me that they only allow 40 lb per ticket (instead of the usual 50 lb per ticket) and they charged me $140 for the 20 lb excess baggage. On the plane, you get charged $14 for a blanket, $7 per drink, and $5 for earphone to listen to music or movie. When I initially bought my tickets from them, I thought I had a good deal, saving $300 on 2 tickets over Air France's price. However, XL Airways were unimaginably rude and unfair, and they will find every excuse to deny you your due to charge you more,  and likely incentivise their employees to extract the max from clients. At the end it was mega bad deal as it cost me $250 more than if I flew with Air France and minus AF courteous service and always ready to accommodate you attitude and the perks on board: super food, good wine and free blankets, earphones, movies etc.

### "anyone had this kind of problem"
I can't complain about the flight itself due to the price. I live in Paris and have double nationality. However, I was traveling on my American passport (as one is obliged to do when traveling to the US) and when I got to JFK for my return flight to Paris, XL Airways France to give me a boarding pass unless I produced a french passport, which I had not brought with me. To my surprise, my french identity card had expired in July. XL Airways forced me to buy a return ticket to the US (which I will not be able to use) or wouldn't allow me on my return flight. They said that I risked being sent back to the US. I have flown in and out of Paris for 25 years using my US passport without problem - and this trip was the same; the french authorities stamped my US passport with no question. Has anyone else had this kind of problem with XL Airways or any other airline?

### "very small and hard seats"
On an economy flight you should not expect to much. But you should expect something. It starts with not being able to check in and print boarding passes on line. Next, if your not aware, please note that luggage weight limit is 44 lbs not the standard 50. Very little assistance for the disabled. They offer everything you may need, at a price. Pillows, blankets, drinks (water free, meal) all at substantial cost. Worst though are the very small and hard seats. Most uncomfortable flight in my life. Attendents slow to respond to any request unless your buying something. On the positive, flight was on time. Never fly again with XL.

### "experience was great"
I flew XL Airways France from New York to Paris and back, returning on Sunday Septemeber 27th into JFK. The airline had an extremely friendly crew on both leg, the inflight food was up to standard, and the flights departed as scheduled. The whole experience with this airline was great. I will say this much I rarely give reviews, I felt impelled to share my personal experience which was 100% pleasant.

### "I highly recommend this airline"
After flying the 11:55 pm XL Airways France flight from New York JFK to Paris and returning a week later, I have to say this was the best airline I have flown! It was a new plane, seats were tight like all economy flights but I was fairly comfortable. Staff was very friendly and the flight took off and landed on time both trips. The meal was pretty good and they walked around constantly offering free water throughout the flight. They had drinks but I was okay with water. The movies were in French, but I slept so it didn't matter. I spent half what I would have on any other flight and it would have been a waste. The flight was perfect and I highly recommend this airline.

### "seats standard size and comfortable"
We were apprehensive, having looked at unfavourable XL Airways France reviews. This was a round-trip flight New York-Paris. Both flights were on time. We are not small people. The seats, which we paid extra for, were standard size and comfortable. The food was airline food, but above average for its class, and they offered seconds of rolls. The downsides : you can't check in online and they don't offer accommodations for handicapped or seniors until you've checked in. So, if that's your situation, be warned. We got to the airport the customary 2.5-3 hrs ahead of boarding and had no problems, though. you have to email for the seat upgrade - it's not possible online. The video entertainment, on central screens, looked really awful, but it didn't matter to us.

### "most uncomfortable flight ever taken"
My flight from New York to Paris today was the most uncomfortable I've ever taken. Understanding that XL Airways France is a budget airline, my expectations weren't particularly high, but they failed to provide even the most basic level of comfort and hygiene. The smell inside the aircraft was quite terrible. They're able to offer a lower price by fitting more people onto each flight. I'm not a large person by anyone's standards, but I found myself constricted by the width of the seat and squashed against the passenger to my left. Not ideal on a 7 hour flight. The aircraft had no overhead vents and the temperature was too high. No pillows are offered, and I think it's unreasonable to suggest that pillows aboard an international flight are a luxury. This is the first international flight I've been on that didn't offer a small pillow or blanket. The bathroom was a disgrace. The attendant did his best to mask the smell with some kind of spray, but it hardly helped. At no point was water offered to passengers during the flight. Again, it'd be absurd to suggest that basic refreshments are a luxury. What makes all of this worse is that I paid an additional $70 I paid for a 'seat upgrade'. Granted I had some extra leg room, but I was positioned underneath a leaking door seal and so by the time I left the aircraft I had wet shoes. I'm not looking forward to my return flight.

### XL Airways France customer review
Just flew XL. Five hour delay leaving NY. An hour late boarding, then circling the tarmac. Returning from Paris was just as bad. Another delay. Then people boarded, then were told to disembark. We were told a 40 min delay, then were called to board 5 min later. The service was horrible. We sat in the front of plane, rows 1-12. The one attendant on the starboard side of the plane were rude. Attendants were adept at passing their eyes over anyone who needed anything. Don't be fooled by low prices, it is only a relflection of terrible service and extremely uncomfortable seat with very thin cushions.

### XL Airways France customer review
I booked XL Airways well in advance as we were looking for a great price to fly our family of 5 from San Francisco to Paris in June. I read all the negative reviews and decided to take a chance with this low cost operator. We had an excellent experience. We were prepared for delays and extra charges. What we experienced was excellent cheerful service from check in to arrival. The flights were efficient and on time in both directions. We paid extra to check bags and get better seats, but we still saved hundreds of dollars per flight. If I needed water when service wasn't offered, I simply went to the back and asked. It was good to stretch my legs on a long flight. They even fed us two meals that were included in the price. The seats were uncomfortable, but I was prepared for some discomfort. If you're looking to save some money on a flight to Europe, this is a great choice.

### XL Airways France customer review
This was the least expensive flight I saw advertised and was not as bad as some reviews had made me fear. The legroom is scarce for a taller person (I am 5 foot 9) and it seemed that this flight was slightly longer than it actually was. The food was average, but, given the price, I cannot say I won't fly this airline again.

### XL Airways France customer review
Had an 11.55pm flight. Get to airport at 8.30 pm for check in - no one at desk. Sign says delayed until 6.30am. They start checking in at 9.30pm. Tell us we can't leave. Give some food vouchers and we have to sleep on the floor. Start boarding at 8 am with busses to take us out to the plane since they lost the gate. Finally leave at 9.00am. Lost a whole day of trip with no compensation. No TV or movies. One meal. Coming home another 3 hour delay with no information. Next time pay the extra.

### XL Airways France customer review
This was by far the worst flight I have ever experienced, and I am sad that I have to take them home for my return. The flight began with being delayed by over half an hour (we were made aware of this and this is the least of my concerns). I was assigned seat 17J - it had a broken seat belt (it was missing the entire part that the buckle clicks into. Luckily the flight was not full and I was able to move. I could not get any of the outlets under the seats to work, and I have never been on an international flight that did not at least have TV screens built into the seats and a USB port for passengers to charge their devices. The closest TV screen to me was in row 15 in the middle. The majority of of the films shown ended up having squiggly lines running through the screen so I could not watch and/or even make out the subtitles from where I was sitting. On this flight of roughly 10 hours, I was also shocked that the staff walked aroung only twice offering water outside of the food service. During dinner I enquired about getting a soda and they said there would be a charge! 15 minutes after that I asked a flight attendant if I could purchase a soda, and she informed me that the drink service was over and I would have to go to the back of the plane to purchase. Overall I am disappointed, for what I paid for this flight, the service was completely inadequate.

### XL Airways France customer review
This airline offers cheap flights to Paris but, you get what you paid for. I took a round trip flight from NY to Paris in July 2015, and it was one of the worst experiences I have had. The airplanes I took were old model, they did not have TV's, they had monitors. Because the planes were so old, the seats were extremely uncomfortable. There is no option to push your seat back because there was no space! Even if you had that option, it would be almost cruel to the person sitting behind you. I am 5’1 and my knees were almost touching the seat in the front. So if you are taller than 5’3, the economy ticket of this airline is not for you. I had to stand up a few times during the flight in order to have some blood circulation though my legs. Also, if you are a person who likes air conditioning, their planes are room temperature. Meaning, for me, it was hot throughout the whole flight. The food was decent, but the flight attendants were rude. You are only allowed to get water or coffee with your meal, for everything else, you have to pay extra. $4 for a can of coke! Overall, it was a nightmare for me, mostly because I was so uncomfortable, spending 8 hours in a hot small space was not pretty. So if you have the money to pay a little extra and have a better experience, do it.

### XL Airways France customer review
XL Airways provided a great service for the price. I am not skinny by any definition and am 6ft 1 but the seats were as comfortable as economy on any of the big name carriers. Staff was professional and genuinely seemed to want to make the 7.5 hr flight as comfortable as possible. If your budget stretches to first class on one of the major carriers with a comfortable bed and Michelin starred dining then you shouldn't be booking on XL Airways France if on the other hand your budget would normally have you in steerage on any of the other airlines and you want to save money to do something fun at your destination book XL Airways.

### XL Airways France customer review
My sister and I flew to and from JFK to Paris (CDG) this past weekend and had an excellent experience. All the processes from checking-in to customer service to inflight to claiming our luggage to doing it all over again on our way back were flawless. I was impressed at the level of professionalism the airline's personnel exhibit. Our flight was on time out of JFK and 10 minutes late out CDG. Both ways we arrived on time. Our luggage was not lost but instead it was delivered promptly and with all the contents. The seats are just like any other airline. They're small yes. They are comfortable enough I chose to sit in the middle and do not regret it. The food is airplane food. Any real traveler knows what that means. It doesn't come from a 5-star restaurant nor is it cooked by a Michelin star awarded chef. But it's not bad either. The inflight entertainment was good too. We watched 3 movies we very much enjoyed and had no technical problems with the entertainment system. Our experience was much better those I've had with the big names. I would fly again with this airline.

### XL Airways France customer review
We traveled from JFK to Paris the flight was on time the staff more than friendly. Our baggage was over and didn't charge us a dime extra each of my 3 children were entertained by movies TV shows or music that was provided by individual screens. The food was nothing but typical airline food! Really what do you expect? Eat a good meal prior to your flight. We arrived on time as for as charging for water that is ludicrous! They walked around the entire time offering water! Our experience on the way back was exactly the same. Very satisfied. I would save the money and use it for your destination.

### XL Airways France customer review
Most of my party was on XLF1670 CDG-PTP 28th June. There was a notification late the evening before that the flight would be "late". By arrival at the airport it was confirmed that indeed it was - by 3 days. Absolute chaos at CDG with XL's systems falling apart not enough staff all but one of those standing around doing nothing all information entered by hand since they had no method to get passengers accommodation etc. I'm lucky in that I was able to rebook via Air France (amazingly XL did reimburse for their failure). The rest of my party was on the same flight but on 1st July. Nine hours of delay arrival at 04.30. Summary: XL doesn't have as many planes as they book flights for. They hire in planes as far as can be seen wherever obtainable on the charter market. If the supplying airline has problems - the 1st July flight was on an antique jumbo - XL will just not bother flying. If you want to save a little on the flight cost - assuming you can actually buy at a price which is first visible - be aware that there is a high chance it will go wrong.

### XL Airways France customer review
Just had a round trip MIA-CDG / CDG MIA. I cannot complain about anything. The timing was right very clean. Yes no inflight entertainment but who does not have some sort of personal electronic device these days. Got my iPad uploaded 4 movies for the trip and everything went fine. The crew was very polite. The food? Way better than AA. I was able to upgrade to the Galaxy seating option. Not the equivalent of a full first class accommodation yet very comfortable with a very good service. The price overall was not bad upgrade included!

### XL Airways France customer review
This is a no frills operation but they do it right. The on board staff was friendly and courteous and the plane was clean. We traveled from JFK to Paris and returned after 10 days. It was difficult to hear and see the movies they played but for those who read this is not a problem. The seats seemed small and not well padded. The planes took off and arrived on time - a big plus and we did not have to wait long for our luggage. The woman who checked us in in Paris was exceptionally nice. No complaints and I would use this airline again.

### XL Airways France customer review
14 June 2014 flight 60 CDG-JFK. Absolutely hands down the worst airline in business. They charge for everything from choosing your seat after booking to a cup of coffee onboard. The seats are small and hard and there is very limited inflight entertainment. Food is limited and tasteless. This airline runs only in the summer and it's obvious. Save your time and sanity! Book on a regular airline. FYI New York JFK only adds to the misery.

### XL Airways France customer review
Flight SE0056 and SE0077: What an exciting experience. If you are into Buddhism and things such as just sitting there and letting the time pass a XL Airways France flight will just be the very experience you have been waiting for all your life. There was a 3.5 hour delay on my flight from Paris to Cancun which could only be topped by a 4 hour delay on the way back. I have been offered a 15 USD meal voucher on the way back but not on the way out. My seat was broken. On the way out the plane could not depart because of a technical problems and an ongoing inspection which built up my confidence in the French authorities but not in the airline. The staff were friendly and made considerable efforts to make the trip pleasant. However for what is was the price was completely exaggerated. I have chosen XL Airways France because they offered a direct flight to my destination which I thought would safe me time. I could have had a one stop flight with higher comfort and at lower price operated by Air France. Eventually this would have been the better decision.

### XL Airways France customer review
JFK to CDG return on XL Airways last week. Was a little nervous after the reviews I had read but it was a very good experience. Got to JFK 2.5 hrs early just to be safe and had about a 15 minute wait at check-in. The staff was very courteous and the check-in process was very easy. The plane was a new A330 which was quite nice. The seats were narrow but nicely appointed with blue leather. My wife and I managed to get 3 seats to ourselves which made the red-eye a more pleasant experience. Attendants were very nice and the plane took off right on time. They showed 2 movies in French with English subtitles. It made the cabin quite bright so I would have brought an eye mask to help me sleep. We were fed a breakfast an hour before landing and arrived right on time. Luggage came out quickly. On the way back the plane was not as full and at check-in we were able to get and aisle and window seat with the middle blocked out. Which made for another comfortable flight. All in all it was a very good experience. It definitely is a step below most carriers in terms of amenities but the plane was clean new and the staff very helpful. And we saved $500 per ticket for a direct flight.

### XL Airways France customer review
My trip from CDG to JFK was a disaster. After an 8.5 hr flight we sat on the runway for 1 hour because there was nowhere to park according to the pilot. After getting through customs it took nearly 30 minutes for the bag carousel to start. So about an hour and 45 minutes after landing I finally get my bag. My girlfriends bag wasn't in the first round of bags. We had to wait another half an hour before the carousel started up again. I can only assume they have one cart and a small group of bag handlers. In short we landed at 10pm and left the airport at 12.40. I will pay for a real airline in the future - it's worth the extra few hundred bucks. On top of that the seats are very small and have zero leg room the inflight entertainment was poor and they charged me for a half a cup of soda.

### XL Airways France customer review
Yes XL seats are average size and yes there is little in-flight entertainment. Actually I found the flight far better than many I've had recently and XL far exceeded my experience flying from Europe on American Airlines several months prior. The staff are quite congenial and helpful. The plane is clean and the service quite acceptable. Airline travel these days is not fun and unless you are flying first class few airlines meet the acceptable experience we had on XL. So if you want to get to Paris with some money in your wallet enjoy reading napping or other means of self-entertainment and are not obese then I highly recommend this airlines. The comments complaining about XL's service are clearly from customers who like to complain. Flying XL is just fine so do it.

### XL Airways France customer review
JFK-CDG. Once at the airport you will take your luggage to the shadiest check-in counter then navigate your way to the most isolated gate at your terminal. Your interaction with staff will be brief and to the point. XL does not win any medals for hospitality. But the planes are all throw-aways from second-tier airlines. You may find that you're travelling in say a Garuda Airlines plane from the 80's. The seating arrangement on XL is probably in violation of at least a dozen FAA regulations and if not it should be. Where seats are normally arranged in rows of 2-4-2 this airline opted for a novel 3-3-3 set-up. This adds an extra seat to each row but unfortunately the back of each seat is practically glued to the back of the adjacent seat and as a result the armrests between seats have nowhere to lift. You will be squeezed in so tightly that if you're even moderately overweight forget it: you won't fit. If you're taller than 6 feet you will probably hurt your knees back and/or neck staying in a contorted position for 7 hours. The seats don't really recline with the exception of a few broken ones that recline too much. The rows are so close to each other that a laptop won't open with sufficient clearance to let you type on it. The food will be nothing short of revolting but you should expect that. Bring your own water: the one you can purchase on board costs $3 for a 16-oz bottle. Want coffee? That will be another $3. They say you get what you pay for. Sometimes however the bargain is just not worth it.

### XL Airways France customer review
We were booked on a flight from CDG to JFK on Sep 23 2013 at 07.30 pm. Before heading to the airport I called to find out what terminal and was told terminal 4 by an XL representative. When we arrived at CDG there was no terminal 4 and know one knew where to find their counter. I tried calling again but was disconnected several times. When we finally made it to 2A and there wasn't anyone there to help since it was 40 minutes before the scheduled departure. I called and was informed that terminal 4 was wrong but that it was 1A which she later corrected to 2A. I'm certain that the representative didn't purposefully give us wrong information but that information caused us to miss our flight. I requested for customer service to put us on the next available flight but was told "After considering your request we are sorry to inform you that we will not be able to give you a positive answer. As it turns out terminal 4 is where they fly in to JFK.

### XL Airways France customer review
I had booked a flight Catania to Paris non stop months ago. I booked the flight because it was a non stop. A week before the flight I received an email telling me that the flight had been changed and would now stop in Palermo before going to Paris and would therefore arrive Paris at 02.10 in the morning and would take twice as long! I called them to try to cancel the flight. It cost me close to 10 dollars because they have a phone number which charges you for waiting on the line. They then told me that the flight was still technically a non stop flight as the stop in Palermo was merely "technical" (whatever that means) and that as the arrival was less than 2 hours later than originally planned they did not have to reimburse me. I will never use this company again.

Just returned after a trip with family to Paris from JFK. Check-in with e-ticket was no hassle. No pre-selection available but they were good in making sure that family was seated together. Be aware of size and weight limits on baggage but we didn't have problems. Seats no different than other carriers. The crew was professional and accommodating. The flights left and arrived on time. The food was typical airline stuff. All considered wouldn't hesitate to travel with XL again. Saved nearly $2500 by using them.

MIA-CDG. The seats uncomfortable and you could not move since the space between the seats was ridiculously small. Seating upright my knee touched the seat in front of me. You cannot get a seat assignment before checking in. The check in is very Slow. The baggage allowance are under all other airlines.

New York JFK - Paris CDG 3 July. Was pleasantly surprised. As someone who travels a lot I was impressed by how much of an effort FA's made to be nice. The seats were a bit small but not more than most airlines these days and they were modern and clean. The meal was just okay but I was not that hungry and the coffee was delicious. The money I saved was well worth it!

Our trip was fine. XL got us to Paris and back earlier this month with no drama. The flight was very smooth and our party of six easily saved $3000 over what the major carriers charge on this route. The cabin crew gets high praise for their professionalism and courtesy. We would definitely fly XL again.

CDG-JFK. New aircraft. Dinner served a couple hours after take off. Plenty filling. Seats are similar to what is found on a regional jet - less width less legroom and they put 9 across on an A330-300. Paid $650 which is a bargain. Return flight was not full requested a row to myself which was granted. Video on overhead monitors - one movie and a couple shorts. Unlike JFK boarding was by row from Paris. Flight left on time arrived on time.

JFK-CDG. Flight left at midnight. New aircraft. No meal after take off breakfast at landing - which was of better quality than I've been served on many American carriers. At other times drinks were a la carte. Seats are similar to what is found on a regional jet - less width less legroom and they put 9 across on an A330-300. BUT the ticket price was $650 which was nearly $400 less than Air France. Flight was full difficult to sleep due to limited recline. Audio available in each seat. Video on overhead monitors - one movie offered. Boarding was odd no announcement so it was a free for all. Bottom line: I got to Paris with my luggage and paid only $650. The is a value airline but I have better things to do with $400 than give it to a legacy carrier.

Flew XL Airways JFK-CDG last week. Its a low cost airline so you get what you pay for. Tickets are always really cheap but it has its toll. The plane was a brand new A330 with 400 souls inside so be patient. The check-in was probably the slowest I have seen in my life. They have a strict 1 bag 20 kgs policy and they could even charge you extra if your suitcase is a bit big even if its empty so check terms and conditions before buying a ticket.. No IFE on board no drinks or snacks just a breakfast upon arrival. Small seats little leg room but for half the price than anyone else.

JFK-CDG. There was no online check-in or assigned seating. My carryon was weighed - backpack containing my purse and newspaper which I had to remove so it would weigh under 5 kilos. Luggage was piled to the side of check-in which was a hint of what was to come. Boarding was a nightmare as it was first come first served and not seating by rows or sections. 2 cups of water and 1 meal later we arrive and promptly find 2 of our party's luggage missing. It appeared that over 50 other passengers where missing their luggage. It is now day 3 of no luggage and I have nothing good to say about this airline.

We flew XL France out of Paris. Searching their website was most unhelpful. Unlike Air Asia Tiger Air and Jetstar (all are low cost carriers in Asia) we found XL France website the least interactive with customers. Our attempts to communicate with XL France to purchase two seat upgrades met with a "wall". We had to get friends in Paris to talk to them. Otherwise food in Premium economy was good. What saved. The day was a stewardess who was very professional with her excellent service to all. Leaving today 2013 for Paris fm Cancun and am told by XL I can only purchase an upgrade at the airport. So it means leaving early to wait in queue. You wished XL France could be more customer friendly.

### XL Airways France customer review
XL Airways France is a charter airline that has recently entered the US market. I flew SFO to CDG non-stop and paid $500 less per person than I would have on Air France. That's considerable savings! I read you get what you pay for - well I happen to have flown Air France also and they are no different than XL Airways France. The economy in XLF is very similar to Air France with the exception of IFE/ individual screens. You get two meals on a 10 hour flight - a warm meal after take off and a cold meal before landing. One my first leg I upgraded to Premium Economy for a measly $39. The only difference is a few extra inches of leg room (barely noticeable) and leather seats. You still don't get individual screens (only in Galaxie Class or First Class). Crew is extremely friendly and bilingual.

I just come back from a trip to the west coast: CDG-SFO-CDG. For the first time I flew on XLAirways. The check-in was quite good. However the boarding was a little bit of a mess in Paris. There were mothers with babies who had not been even taken care of. During the flight the kindness of the crew was quite good and its efficiency too. Seats would have leant a bit more you could have thought you were in business class.

Flew SFO-CDG on 2 Jun 2012 and return CDG-SFO on 30 Jun. Good flights in both directions. Economy seats are standard Airbus seats in 3-3-3 configuration on A330. Meals are typical airline fare. No matter what airline you fly always best to get a good pre-flight meal if in economy. One must recognize that the meal is simply to help pass the time. Whatever deficiencies others express about XL Airways are made up by the personable flight crew and the great fare prices. Check in was very efficient in San Francisco; typically Gallic in Paris.

Paris-San Francisco in GALAXIE Class. Friendly service good food decent amenity kit and I liked the films on the video player. The plane is older but comfortable enough and the service makes up for it. The price for Galaxie is comparable to premium economy - and their service is far better than Air France. XL Airways is a great alternative and I'm glad they are doing the Paris-SFO LAS and NYC route. Good value for money! They need to add a lounge for Galaxie and maybe think about a loyalty program. I will fly them again over AF any day.

I have traveled 6 times between New York and Paris over the last two years have found the airline reliable the crew to be friendly and efficient.

### XL Airways France customer review
My son and I have flown twice on XL mainly because we are on a budget to get to Paris. The seats are tiny and often the crew forget to translate what is being said into English. The crew in the cabin are good considering the long flights. The meals are horrible I recommend eating in the airport prior to boarding. If you don't mind getting up and going to find the crew yes there is enough water I recommend you bring a big bottle. The first time we flew the toilets backed up the second time no problems. Movies were in French only on 1st flight that was fixed on the second flight. Overall you get what you pay for so I will fly them again.

### XL Airways France customer review
We booked 3 tickets from JFK in New York City to Paris France because they were a great value on an online booking service. We did not recognize the name of the airline and after booking we started to research comments of those who had used XL. Most all of the comments were bad and we assumed it would be a bad experience. Both flights were on time to the minute. The boarding was fast and easy on both ends JFK & CDG. The airline attendants were both friendly and helpful! The food was good and there was plenty we did not finish eating all of ours. There was enough water so don't worry about taking your own. We have to fly on a regular basis and would choose XL Airways France again. These were among the best flights we have ever had. The only down side was that the seats were small and we are small people so that might be an issue but our flight was only 7 hrs so it didn't bother us. Also we don't know French and most of the details on the Internet are in French. We were assigned our seats when we checked in but there was no problem with getting our seating together. Everyone seemed happy on our flight and I did not hear one complaint.

### XL Airways France customer review
I travelled on XL I was worried about my trip because there is very little information about XL. The trip was fine. We arrived at JFK 3 hrs early and were all seated together (4 of us). The plane is mostly all French. The seats were fine. The service was fine. Our return trip was the same. I would recommend the airline for those looking for a cheap flight.

### XL Airways France customer review
This company is a real cattle truck. I have taken different occasions to Corsica Cancun. The trip is very long the seat are too tight and flight is a horror.

### XL Airways France customer review
XL Airways France flies twice a week between Paris and Las Vegas. The flights are cheap - a bit over $1800 for Galaxie class $700 for economy both round-trip. Separate lines for Galaxie class made check-in a breeze boarding was quick in Las Vegas a mess in Paris. Seats in the small Galaxie class section 27 of them on A330 were about what one would expect on a domestic AA or UA flight. Meals were decent and beverages were available throughout the flights. Cabin crew were friendly and helpful.
