### "I will never fly them again"
Not Verified |  Tropic Air does not honor their advertised "Free re-booking onto our next available flight if your flight into Belize International is delayed. Our flight from Houston to Belize City was delayed and moved to the next day. We contacted them to say that we would be arriving the next day to see what flights we could get on and they said we had to pay over $500 to hold the seats or the whole reservation would be cancelled. We were delayed in Houston by United airlines problems and tried to get on a later same day flight instead of calling Tropic Air right away to cancel. Apparently, spending that time trying to get to Belize City later that same day would have been fine if it had worked out, but since it failed and we couldn't get on a new flight until the next day, we missed their 1 hour notification window and would have to pay for our tickets twice. I have flown on Tropic Air before and never had a problem rebooking. I will never fly them again.

### "Tropic Air was a disappointment"
Not Verified |  There is not a lot of options besides Tropic air or Maya Island Air for local travel in Belize. I've flown both and I would say that Tropic Air was a disappointment. I booked a flight with family from Belize City to Dangriga and was dropped off at Placencia. Tropic Air said that they could not land in Dangriga due to issues with the airport at that time. Tropic Air could not schedule another flight that day due to no other scheduled flights leaving that day but it was only 1pm so does the airport only run for half a day?? Also, Tropic Air did not offer another flight the following day so my family was basically stranded in Palencia. My family's 15 minute flight from Belize City to Dangriga turned into 4.5 hour ordeal to get to Dangriga (30 minute flight to Placencia, 1 hour at the Placencia airport trying to figure out how to get to Dangriga, 2.5 hour bus ride to Dangriga. We did ask for a refund for that portion of the flight because we paid for a flight to Dangriga but Tropic Air refused as we did fly in their plane regardless of where we intended to go. In the end, we 1) spent more than 4 hour more on transportation, 2) cancelled paid reservations from being late, 3) paid for additional bus fare and 4) were refused a refund from Tropic Air. Tropic Air is not a reputable business as they will take your money without fulfilling their obligation to transport you to your destination. They can literally drop you off anywhere and still take your money because they only care that you got on the plane.

### "This company is horrific"
This company is horrific. We had a cancelation of our flight back home and this airline refused to refund our money. Fly Maya Island Air. They are exceptional, less expensive and very flexible. The planes are also shady. You will not regret flying Maya Island Air! Have a wonderful and safe flight.

### "Great little airline"
Not Verified |  Best staff ever. Great little airline. We did 5 flights in all, every one on time. Staff super friendly and helpful. We connected in Belize and got through immigration much faster than expected. They put us on an earlier flight and even called our hotel to pick us up early. Excellent service!!!! Planes are small propeller type, so no real in flight service or drinks etc, also note no toilets on board. Flight from Cancun took an hour and a half so worth keeping in mind. They use the private FBO terminal in Cancun airport so make sure your taxi knows that when going to the airport. All in all super friendly, everything was on time, these are small planes but all were smooth even through dark clouds. Very well organised ground staff, a pleasant change from flying through big terminals on big airlines.

### "fabulous little airline"
What a fabulous little airline. We flew Tropic Air from the teeny airport at Tower Hill Belize, which is a metal hut with a single airstrip in the middle of a sugar cane field. Our flight to San Pedro on Ambergris Caye was only 20 minutes. The airport's Tropic Air staff consisted of one friendly gentleman, who didn't ask us for ID because our hotel manager (who drove us to the airport) vouched for us. We met both Tropic Air pilots, who were also quite friendly. Our plane was a little 12-seat single prop beauty that looked very new, inside and out. Hubby and I secured the last seat, bench style and very comfy, with plenty of leg room. There was no cabin staff, no beverages or snacks, not even a commode. But it was a wonderful flight, with wonderful customer service at the airport. We wouldn't hesitate to fly Tropic Air again.

### Tropic Air Belize customer review
SAP-BZE-FRS. I had two flights with this regional airline this past month! Ssmall grand caravan planes but both clean and spotless! flights on time crew friendly! Due to the size of the aircraft there's no FA on board. Price paid fair I do recommend if you're flying to Belize.
