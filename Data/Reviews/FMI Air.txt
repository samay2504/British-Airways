### "it's worth the extra money"
Yangon to Mandalay. I have flown FMI Air four times now. They provide one of the best customer experiences of any airline I have flown. Staff is professional and friendly. Lounges are well-equipped and comfortable. Aircraft are clean. In the often confusing and cattle-herding feel of domestic Myanmar flight, FMI stands out for the comparative serenity of the experience. Flights are roughly $10-20USD/leg more than competitors. When you factor in lounge comfort and beverages, good internet, and the relaxed feel ar both departure and arrival, it's worth the extra money.

### "service was top class"
This is one of the few airlines that flies to the Myanmar capital from Yangon. FMI Air promotes itself as Myanmar's premium airline and lives up to its name. The service was top class throughout. Booked the flight online. A few days before the flight received an email message that there would be a 1.5hr delay. Checkin was smooth and service staff informed me I could use the lounge which is on the second floor of the domestic terminal. Treated like royalty there, with good snacks and free wifi. Flight left at the designated (rescheduled) time. The airline has its own new buses and took one from the gate to the aircraft. Flew on a newish ATR72-600. Very nicely appointed inside, aircrew friendly, smiling and efficient throughout. Both aircrew spoke excellent English. Snack offered was tasty chicken noodles, with cake, fresh fruit, and after-dinner mint (nice touch). Smooth flight arrived a few minutes ahead of schedule. Was impressed and would fly them again. Airline can't be making much on this route though; there were only 2 other passengers on the flight.
