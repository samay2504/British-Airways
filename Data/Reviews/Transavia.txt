### "I’m left without a refund"
I am extremely dissatisfied with the way Transavia has handled my damaged luggage claim for flight HV6885 on November 3, 2024. Despite multiple assurances that I would receive my €1,160 refund, it’s now been four months and I have yet to see any payment or meaningful update. I was initially told that the reimbursement would be processed and transferred to my account, but it hasn’t happened. After numerous attempts to follow up and escalate the issue, I’ve been met with vague responses and constant delays. I was even told that the finance department is "working on it," but there has been no concrete update or resolution. This kind of customer service is completely unacceptable. Transavia’s lack of urgency, poor communication, and disregard for customer rights is disappointing. I hope this issue is resolved quickly, but as of now, I’m left without a refund and a lot of frustration.

### "by far the worst airline"
This is by far the worst airline I have ever used. I work throughout Europe so I fly every 2 weeks and Transavia is to avoid by every means necessary. They do not provide a legal invoice. Their computer system is bad and regularly does not work so you are not even able to print a proof of payment and you can not check in before your flight. You have to go to the desk and you have to explain to them their system does not recognise your name. Then they will argue with you that it is never their fault. 4, some flight attendants are friendly, but most don't care at all. The air plane was really worn down. Seats were old, not comfortable and not very clean in general. You can't buy anything with cash. My 2 experiences with Transavia were that bad that I rearranged working hours on the project. I now drive 20 to 30 minutes more by car to get to another airport where I can choose other airliners and I happily pay 50 to 70 euro more on a return flight. I will not recommend them to anyone, not even as a cheap budget line.

### "charged €60 for an alleged second bag"
Istanbul-Paris: Initially scheduled for 21/11/2024, canceled and rescheduled to 22/11/2024. My ticket clearly included the right to one cabin bag under 10kg, yet I was wrongly charged €60 for an alleged second bag. Check-in closed 90 minutes before departure instead of the promised 60 minutes, and the agent at the counter was threatening and unpleasant. This is unacceptable — please address this matter immediately.

### "affected by Transavia's new baggage rules"
We were not aware that our cabin suitcase was 5 cm too wide. Our last trip was last January, when the suitcases were still with us. - We have now paid 34 euros twice for Cabin Baggage and Priority Boarding (68 euros) - 130 euro surcharge on suitcases on the outward journey - 48 euros for the two suitcases as checked luggage on the return journey. That is 246 euros for two 9 kilo suitcases that were 5 centimeters too wide. In addition, we were unable to use priority boarding on the outward journey because we had to pay the surcharge at a very busy counter. All in all, a big damper on our holiday fun. We believe that we have been disproportionately affected by Transavia's new baggage rules.

### “confusion and lack of transparency”
I have been flying with Transavia for years, but since they introduced the new baggage policy, it has become a nightmare. It's absolutely ridiculous that you now have to pay for practically every kilo of baggage. Hand luggage that used to be fine to bring on board now needs to be checked in or you have to pay extra if it's anything bigger than a small backpack. This only adds stress to packing and leads to extra costs, with no improvement in service whatsoever. The worst part is the confusion and lack of transparency. Even the smallest deviation from the rules results in extra charges, and the communication about this is terribly unclear. At the gate, you see people struggling with their bags, and if you're unlucky, you'll have to check them in last-minute and pay an additional fee. It feels like Transavia is only interested in making more money at the expense of their loyal customers. For me, this is a reason to consider flying with other airlines in the future. Absolutely disappointing.

### "worst airline I've used"
Transavia is the worst airline I've used. They had us sign forms for 5 hours delay of our flight 2 weeks in advance, no problem with that. 2 to 3 days before the flight they announce that another airline is gonna operate the flight. I would never accept to fly with a random airline but they gave us no choice. The day of our flight we receive a text message saying your flight is 2 hours delayed but you must show up at the airport as if there is no delay. So everyone showed up at the airport and we were waiting for 2+ hours standing up in a line while no one was even at the check in desk. Everyone was mad. Then as we were waiting in the line we receive another message that our flight was delayed for 45 more minutes. At this point I notice that instead of 3 hours and 20+/- minutes, the flight will last 18 hours. I went through the whole airport and I called Transavia in Luxembourg many times, just to get a response like: That is correct but I cannot provide you anymore information. Long story short, we were forced to take a fully delayed flight, which was going to be operated from a random airline, the flight wouldn't be direct but instead connected with another airport, waiting in lines for hours without a purpose. no one knew where we were going, no one provided actual and real information. Lastly, they gave us no option to choose otherwise. Transavia's response was a 3,50€ voucher for the flight.

### “a high price for a low cost airline service”
Not Verified | You pay a high price for a low cost airline service. I had a delay of 2:45 hours and I was offered a 3.5 euros voucher! I couldn't even buy water with that! They used to reimburse damaged luggage but not anymore. Apparently they don't feel responsible for that anymore.

### "they said they had overbooked"
Paid 750 euro for these flights a month in advance. Tried to check in online 5 hours in advance and they said no free seats were available but I could check in at the airport. Once we got to the airport they said they had overbooked (sold our spots) and we would have to find a new flight. My partner boarded and they left her bag in Athens and sent my bag with her. Had to stand at the service desk for 4 hours before they had arranged a new flight.

### “no one knew anything”
Not Verified | The most negative experience of my life! In short: I do not recommend flying with this airline ever. To describe it in more detail: - had to pay 65 euros at the airport because only backpacks were allowed and it was heavily hidden when purchasing the ticket. Approximately 20% of our flight paid for luggage because they were also scammed. The employee on departure was extremely rude, she waved her off and did not answer our questions - flights are consistently delayed for 1-3 hours, our flight there was also delayed - the flight back was first delayed for 3 hours, and then they said that it was rescheduled for the next day after lunch. We were taken to the hotel 3 hours later and it was already 2 am. They told me to arrive at the airport at 8:30 am. We arrived, no one knew anything, we started searching and just found out from the airport workers that our flight was canceled - and we were told to just buy new tickets or get home as we wanted. Our flight was supposed to last 3 hours, so our house was not nearby, across the sea - after that we started calling the airline while we were at the airport with our things and didn’t know what to do and when we could fly home. In support, we encountered the incompetence of Transavia support; at first they asked us what we wanted, if we were to fly, we could do it in 2 days. There are no other options. After that, when we went through check-in, we realized that they could take us to another airport in our country, the Netherlands is small. But they didn't do it, yeah but they didn’t do this and we had to rent an apartment and wait for our flight for 2 more days instead of being at home.

### “extremely aggressive, impolite and rude”
My sister and I were traveling back to Paris from Lisbon, from a business trip. We are frequent flyers, and never had problems. On the waiting line to board, all of a sudden my phone went dead, I go searching for a plug to charge my phone, since my boarding pass was on it. Our turn arrive, my sister proceed to show her boarding pass and mine since she had it on her phone, I try to explain the situation to the ground stewardess, that my phone went dead, she refuses to listen! Impossible to communicate with someone that does not listen to you, the lady named ADI, proceed to bark at us especially at me in front of all the stunned travelers. She was extremely aggressive, impolite and rude, for no reason, yelling and barking:identification! Identification! Identification! in a very poor English, for someone working on a company that works with so many nationalities worldwide. I show my ID, she doesn't look at me, and say I quote talking to her colleague as rude as her, "now she will wait until the end of the boarding" mind you, my sister had scanned my boarding pass! I stayed there until the last passenger passed, just because she wanted, mocking me with her colleague feeling very proud to have the power to block me there. I was told later by another passenger inside of the plane, that she said in Portuguese "I will block her here and she won't travel" and another stewardess the only one, doing her job with respect and well manners replied "why? don't do that, let her go" and she finally looked at my ID card, that I was holding for 20 minutes and let me go! This is outrageous. Transavia must be very desperate to hire so many rude and incompetent, ground stewardess, that woman  should never be allowed to work with people.

### "Priority boarding is a hoax"
Priority boarding is a hoax: although we paid for it there was no priority given to us. Delay as usual, and there is always a so called excuse. Aged plane. Dirty and small seats, dirty magazine, dirty seatpockets full of rubbish of the passenger of an earlier flight; stewardess told that there is no cleaning service available. So everybody sits between the rubbish left by earlier travelers. Terrible food that you pay way too much for. The food on the menu is unhealthy: too much wrong fats and too high amounts of kcal; just junkfood chosen with not at all any care for health and sustainability. You can transport cattle with Transavia but not me anymore.

### "boarding policy is a complete scam"
Transavia flight HV6730. Let's address the grift first. Their new boarding policy is a complete scam. Hand luggage that does not fit under the seat is no longer guaranteed with the ticket, only THE FIRST 70 pieces are allowed on board, the rest will have to go into the hold. They offer priority boarding for 22 euros per person, per flight, but what they don't tell you, is that everyone on the flight can buy priorty boarding. The Airbus a321neo has a max capacity of 220 passengers. You see where this is going. Boarding process has 3 zones, zone 1 are all the people that fell for the priorty boarding scam, more than half of the passengers. Zone 2, people stupid enough to pay extra (me) to sit in the front, thinking overhead luggage is guaranteed and the seating is more spacious. And at last zone 3, people that just bought a ticket, no extras, the smart ones I found out. Boarding was a complete mess, zone 1 passengers shoving, pushing and fighting to be one of the first 70, ultimately led to people being told they cannot bring their luggage on board while having paid for priorty. Next were zone 2, "sorry, we've given your overhead compartment space to all the people in zone 1 even tho you paid extra for your seat. When arriving in the cabin everyone had to the tell the main FA their seat numbers again because Transavia messed up. They sold already reserved seats to priorty boarders and were overbooked. People that had bought seats in aisle 9 now had to sit somewhere in the back, no apologies. All this idiocy made the whole boarding process take 50 minutes. This was completely avoidable, but because of Transavia's insane boarding policy and incompetent crew, we now missed our assigned departure slot. The flight itself was miserable. Transavia has managed to make the Airbus a321neo, a brand new model, one of the worst and cramped flights ever. I am only 168cm tall and my knee hit the seat in front of me and I was shoulder to shoulder with my neighbour. I was sat in row 4, for which I paid extra, but I had no extra legroom, was not allowed to board earlier and my hand luggage was not guaranteed. I bought exactly nothing. During the flight, which was now 4 hours long due to the boarding fiasco, you are not given anything, no water, no coffee nothing. They do offer you to buy snacks and drinks for a hefty premium. 20 minutes before landing, they made the announcement that they would now walk by with luxury items! Are you seriously selling cheap watches and perfumes?! Absolute grifters. When we landed, we we're delayed 1 hour and 10 minutes, and the most astonishing thing happened, the plane halted at a gate that was completely dark. When the captain asked the cabin crew to turn on the lights, they were too busy grabbing their own gear from the overhead first, completely missing the announcement. It took them a couple of minutes realizing we were at the gate and they needed to turn on the cabin lights. Next the pilot announced to open the doors. He must have been flying blind because the gate was still dark and there was no tunnel or stairs! It took a full 10 minutes before the ground crew of a different aircraft noticed us trapped and walked over with flash lights to check on us. All this time, the cabin crew was dead silent, avoiding eye contact and questions. Finally the tunnel was attached to the aircraft and people could disembark. Shouting in the tunnel. All the Transavia ground personel left and the doors at the end of the tunnel to the airport

### "charges €60 for a small cabin bag"
Transavia charges €60 for a small cabin bag that fits under the seat. Long lines. Purely low cost. Small seats, minimal legroom. Unprofessional and uncourteous cabin crew. One of the worst airlines I've used .

### "unpleasant and frustrating"
Beirut to Paris with Transavia on May 1, 2024. The weather was fine throughout the entire flight, except the last hour when it started raining and we could actually see the thunderstorm. Instead of landing in Paris, Orly at 10:15 PM we landed in Charles De Gaulle airport at 3 AM. Obviously, the weather caused the bulk if the issue but this review is about how the staff handled the situation. Around 10 pm (almost time for landing) the pilot says we’re landing in CDG instead of Orly, which is 40 minutes far, but no one really complained since we saw the weather. We failed to land there because of the weather and ended up landing in Lille (North if France). 30 minutes in, no one had explained to us anything except that we’re in Lille. After constant questioning, the staff explained that we we’re going to wait in Lille for the storm to get better, which was around 2 hours. Note that if I didn’t personally ask multiple times, they were leaving us completely uninformed. During this eventually 3 hours, the staff was not communicating updates unless constantly asked, did not provide us with water, food, or internet to contact the people waiting for us at the airport. One passenger who already had a french sim gave 7 of us hotspot in order to do that. I asked for water repeatedly, even offering to pay for it, and was ignored. Then, in hour in we know that there’s no water in board and no on told us or did anything about it. The weather is obviously not in anyone’s control, but the management of the situation and the service and experience provided is, and it was horrible. They didn’t address our stress, hunger, thirst, and in some cases, fear of what is happening. It was very unpleasant and frustrating, and no longer that cheap honestly, so what’s the point!

### "a potentially good airline"
First time flying with Transavia as they just added Milan Malpensa to their network. The flight to Paris Orly was opened 3 weeks before I flew. For this reason it was not possible to perform web check in, and we had to queue at check in desk despite having only hand luggage. This was annoying and hard to understand. Beside this, the seats were allocated close to each other. By chance we had an emergency window row, thus legroom was fantastic. The flight arrived 30 min late, not sure whether for their problems or handling issues. My feeling is that it's worth to try again this airline, since at this time the check in issue did not feel very good, but for the rest they look a like a potentially good airline.

### "never fly Transavia again"
Transavia is the worst airline I have ever flown. The staff at the airport insisted that I pay 30 Euros for 1.5 kilos of additional weight. To my husband, the lady at the check-in desk argued and insisted that his carry on was oversized and that he had to pay 60 euros to ship it in cargo although it fit the measurements. It was only after he dropped it in the slot that she was reluctantly convinced. The flight was late in Paris. We had to wait standing in line inside the tunnel that leads to the aircraft for 30 minutes. No explanation was provided for this delay other than “technical difficulties”. On board, the chicken sandwich that cost 7 euros tasted nothing like chicken. When I complained to the flight attendant, he just shrugged. I will never fly Transavia again.

### “unprofessional and disrespectful”
Awful experience, very bad customer service unprofessional and disrespectful. They denied my boarding due to an error they made during check in and did not want to take accountability for it. Did not offer any kind of help or compensation instead tried to blame me for their mistake. Staff are very unprofessional and their treatment was inhuman, even online customer service did not even take the time to read my complaint and just refused the refund with a generic sentence. Horrible experience will never book with this company again. they are cheap for a reason!! Everything is cheap about them.

### "staff is friendly and attentive"
The low-cost daughter company from KLM serving mostly leisure destinations but also some harder to reach others. Generally all is fine, staff is friendly and attentive but you get the usual tradeoffs: very tight seat pitch and everything beside your ticket price is extra paid. Prices for the onboard menu aren't bad. Their fleet consists of 737's so that limits your personal space even more.

### "dont fly with this airline"
Not Verified | Its The Worst Airline Ever. The service was BAD, And the landing was like a Ryanair. And We Were 20 minutes too late. People, dont fly with this airline.

### "lost my luggage for more than two weeks"
Not Verified |  The airline lost my luggage for more than two weeks when I flew from Amsterdam to Catania last month. After getting my luggage back, I applied for a compensation for the items I bought, but they rejected my request several times and said you applied for the compensation after 21 days! I was never informed of any timeline.

### “the worst food options”
Not Verified | Flew 6 times with them this year, the airplane is clean and people working for Transavia are nice but I have had 30 minutes to 2 hours delays on every flight I had with them. Besides that the chairs are very small and bad, not much extra comfort available. As for food, they only have cookies, candies, chemical noodles and 3 sandwiches all with cheese. I am allergic to cheese, so there was no option to eat something decent! It’s the worst food options I ever saw with all airlines I flew with in my life. They should really add some real and nutritious food to their menu. Even in Spanish budget airline, I get real and nutritious food.

### "What a huge disappointment"
This is the worst experience I've had traveling recently. I had an early flight that was delayed for two hours, waited 2hrs to pick up my luggage and missed my connecting flight. This ordeal cost me an additional $1000. If you have a choice, please don't fly this airline. Their staff is very rude and they just don't care. They nickel and dime you out of every penny but don't care anything about their passengers. What a huge disappointment.

### " how can we get the money back"
We bought our tickets from Madrid to Paris two months in advance, on the day we are supposed to fly, 09/18/23, at the airport we were informed that our flight was canceled and the only date available to flight was 09/23/23. We lost the hotel not refunded, return tickets and now we are trying to figure out how can we get the money back. Horrible Customer Service.

### "customer service is just terrible"
Worst interaction that i had in ~100 flights. Rude and careless staff in airport on information desk and check-in counter, simply refuse to communicate on English and just waving with their hands in your face. Flight delayed for hour after boarding on plane. Luggage was lost and all communication/customer service is just terrible. Nobody pick up the phone for weeks, refuses to provide with any info by mail or messengers. Just sending same replays for days. Not possible to receive any compensation. Don't use this airline if you respect yourself

### "Boarding process is an absolute chaos"
Not Verified |  Boarding process is an absolute chaos and mess. The queues are not respected, but the problem is the staff do not care about it, and don't control it. Also, you won't be able to keep your suitcase above your seat because people just leave them wherever they want. So your seat can be on 3rd row but your suitcase goes on row 10 which is a big problem when disembark, as you can imagine. If you ask the staff, they won't care. And about being punctual, this airline is the worst. Honestly, if the flights were 20€ each, I would understand all the above. But that's not the case.

### "customer service was horrible"
As a sky team platinum flyer, Transavia customer service was horrible. Could not check in online. At the airport they would not let me change my seat, recognize my status, allow me to upgrade. KLM and Air France would not intervene to assist telling me had to check in at airport and talk to agent. The flight was delayed waiting on passengers for an hour. The quality of service and food on board was low. We were packed like sardines in a can. I would not fly with them ever again.

### "the worst airline"
Not Verified | By far, the worst airline I have ever had a displeasure of booking a flight with. They delayed my flight for over 24 hours, and by EU law are obliged to offer compensation to their customers. It has been about a year later, and I am still fighting with them about getting my compensation for this delayed flight.

### "customer service is absolutely horrendous"
Transavia. They are terrible and horrible. The least friendly and worst low cost airline I have ever experienced. I flew with them on multiple occasions and none was at least ok/stress free. Additionally the customer service is absolutely horrendous. I had to call them 3 times for an airport tax refund and more than 30 days later it still has not happened after they confirmed on each call it was all set and confirmed!? Their customers are just used to cash in but for anything else you "can go to hell". They also have cost me way more than booking with a regular airline with so much more discomfort and headaches. I dont usually review but after friends also had an woeful experience it might be useful to someone. Safe travels!

### "no service at all"
Not Verified |  Paid for unaccompanied minor service...no service at all. Minor lost her flight! No one ever contacted the minor. They just didn't do anything. Minor got stranded at airport and had to pay for a new ticket. No refund either. Completely untrustworthy!

### "Don't think even about booking them"
1. The Gate was showing 20 min. before the flight 2. No news about boarding time 3. They didn't let us into the airplane, even tough it was still standing in front of us, we were 5 people with boarding passes and reserved seats 4. Instead of letting us in, they spent their time to taking our luggage from the plane 5. All of us, we had to go back to the terminal to get our luggage officially from the belt which took around 30 min to 1 hour. 6. After that, we all went to the service desk of Transavia and there they told us, they were not from Transavia and they cannot help us. 7. I have never had such bad service with non-helpful people. 8. Customer care is better to be named customer pain! 9. Don't think even about booking them, even if cheaper than others, in the end you pay more than triple the amount you spent.

### "never fly Transavia again"
Our flight on June 18th, from Porto to Paris has been cancelled last minute (at boarding time). We have opened a claim the next day, and have received no answer from Transavia. We have send >15 reminder, through emails and what’s app, and received no answer, neither reimbursement for our flight. This is unacceptable, I will never fly Transavia again.

### "A disaster! Always delayed"
Not Verified | A disaster! Always delayed. I have never arrived on time with this company. You should buy the tickets on the consideration that you will arrive two hours later. With

### "incompetence at its best"
Not Verified | Worst company ever, don't fly on it ever, and if you unfortunately have to - don't ever use suitcases only small bags that you can carry. Worst customer service ever, incompetence at its best, I don't advise it to anyone not even to my worst enemy. TRASH is too good to define this company/service.

### "wouldn't let us do priority boarding"
We always get priority boarding in airports we have been, no matter what we book because we travel with a baby under 2 years old, but at Rotterdam airport they wouldn't let us do priority boarding and we were pushed away. Also no help on board with the baby either.

### "they do not impress with anything"
Not Verified |  They are ok, but they do not impress with anything! They usually leave a little later than scheduled and they don't serve anything for free unlike KLM!

### "a terrible experience"
It has been a terrible experience, starting from the moment we started boarding in Amsterdam airport to the moment we reach Beirut airport. Where we knew that none of our 8 luggage were in the airplane. Our vacation is about to reach its end and the airlines still trying to locate our luggage. We had no satisfactory answer from them for where are our stuff and when we can receive them, if we are going to.

### "overall opinion is horrible"
I had to fly from Berlin to Paris on 6th of July. First time booking a flight with Transavia. 6 hours before the flight I receive a message saying that my flight is cancelled due to a technical problem. Ok, happens. I had an important, urgent medical appointments on July 7th and 8th morning (thanks to those appointments a surgery was planned). The problem had to be solved immediately, so I contacted them via What'sApp, replies took time, I decided to call them. The call lasted 38 minutes. They offered me 3 solutions : Another flight on for 13th of July. Doesn't work for me. Reimburse my ticket,  but doesn't solve my problem. Get another flight from another company. Yes, but the condition was to "find a new ticket with a reasonable price close to the initial one". To be more precise, I paid 98€, they told me I should find something under 150€. If you book a flight the same day, of course all the prices are going to be high! So taking into account the high prices of flights for that day, the service agent made me understand that I won't be fully reimbursed, therefore I'll have to pay extra money. I could finally find a flight for 198€, sent a mail and I'll see if they pay it. An overall opinion is horrible. I had feeling they were mocking me offering a solution which wasn't a solution at all even thought I explained the importance of being in Paris for me. I'll try to avoid this company in the future as much as I can. The only positive point is the service agent who was adorable, really understood my problem and tried to help me, but couldn't do it due to her limits.

### "Horrific experience"
Not Verified | Horrific experience from beginning to end. Baggage check in would have been more efficient if it was run by a sleep depraved 2 year old with a full nappy. Complete MORONS would be a kind description of the Transavia staff inside the terminal at France's largest international airport. You would need mandatory psychiatric assessments conducted on yourself, if you chose to fly with this pack of NIMRODS on more than one unfortunate and life traumatizing occasion. The Wright brothers are still currently leaps and bounds in front of these cretons, when it comes to Customer Service or transporting passengers from location to location. NEVER EVER AGAIN!

### Transavia customer review
Flight was average. Bumpy but nothing they can do about turbulence. Problem was luggage. They lost my sons luggage. After a day they claimed to have found it in Paris and sent it to Rome. But once It arrived I’m Rome they lost us AGAIN! He was without his luggage the entire week. No one knew where it actually was or cared. There was no one at Transavia to help us. No one knew where his bag was. When we were at the airport to leave we went to talk to someone who told us his bag was still in PARIS! We went to talk to another person about who to contact in Paris and they actually had his bag, In a hallway, in Rome and no one knew it was there. So we finally got the bag due to our own persistence as we were returning home from our vacation. Think twice before checking a bag with Transavia. They are completely Incompetent

### "Absolutely horrific experience"
Not Verified | Absolutely horrific experience! Due to strikes in Orly Airport Paris our flight was cancelled. The airline contacted me the day before strike at 16:14 by text to say our flight was rescheduled to go out at 18:40 that same day. We were in Disneyland resort, they expected us to go on 2 hour 30 mins notice to catch the flight and end our holiday 1 day early. How on earth would it have even been possible to catch that flight on 2 hour notice when it takes that time to get to the airport from our location in Paris! Then to top it all off they wanted us to pay for our own flight after they messed us about. Finally after 4 hours of our hotel manager dealing with the airline they rebooted our flight for the next day, the day after strikes for free. I needed to pay hotel for the extra night and on top of it all taxico the company we prepaid our taxi to the airport would not refund us or amend our collection time, nothing, Nada, just we understand but cannot do anything this is our 24 hour cancel policy. I'm not sure what this world has come to. Greed, no compassion just money grabbing and no consideration for human beings. Thankfully not everyone is the same as Transavia and Taxico companies! Never again, don't book with them

### "ground crew got quite aggressive"
Not Verified | We booked a flight from Faro to Stockholm with a stop-over in Amsterdam and paid extra for the carry-on trolley. When boarding we were told we could not bring the carry-on in the plane. I explained we have a stop-over and we didn't want to check-in our bags. The ground crew got quite aggressive and unprofessional and we were basically forced in handing over our carry-on trolleys. The labels were being handwritten which was adding to my concern. The ground crew told us 'Don't worry, your baggage will go to Stockholm". As expected, on arrival in Stockholm our baggage was lost and nobody could tell us where it is. Avoid Transavia at all cost if your baggage is precious to you.

### "lousy service and poor communicatio"
Not Verified |  Flight adjusted 2 weeks before departure and moved 2.5 days, then canceled because they have no planes. Isn't that your core business? What lousy service and poor communication. You will never see me again and I know countless people who feel that way. Do you want to go on vacation? Then don't book with Transavia!

### "Delayed, total chaos"
Delayed, total chaos, no information provided. Waited for 3 hrs, but no information about compensation. No water and no food and we could not leave the gate. Flight operated by GetJet airlines. Airplane with technical problems. It is my third flight with Transavia and my last.

### "a bad experience"
Flight delayed for almost one hour, plane dirty. Flight full and flight attendants couldn’t care less, so a bad experience.

### "flight experience was horrible"
One of the worst airlines. To start with the boarding I never seen a mess like that. There are zones on boarding pass that a supposed to make the process more organized. Not everyone everywhere at the same time. The flight experience was horrible, children running everywhere during the flight the cabin crew is only here to try and sell food and duty basically.

### "KLM/Transavia online check-in mess"
The flight started off with a big disappointment, the KLM/Transavia online check-in mess. When booked through KLM it is not possible to check-in online, although Transavia is a subsidiary of KLM/Air France. In communication with both airlines generic responses are given and no help is offered. That meant an early start to the airport to queue for check-in. It might be a blast from the past to some travelers, but I find this plain silly. Having stated the corporate inability, it has to be mentioned that ground and flight staff were really nice. Food and drinks for purchase are average for low budget carrier. As always for Transavia, leg space is a serious issue - just way too cramped. So we were hoping for a KLM flight, but got a low budget leg instead- will pay closer attention in the future.

### "terrible experience with Transavia"
I had (and am still having) a terrible experience with Transavia. After following the instructions of a member of Transavia's own check-in staff and dropping my luggage off at the oversized drop-off, my bag did not make it to Salzburg and I am without my luggage 6 days later. It was found 4 days ago and I am currently only a two-hour drive from the airport, yet here I still sit without my bag. The number for the Salzburg baggage handling agent does not work - it just rings. When trying to call Transavia, the automatic service keeps saying it cannot recognise the number I select (even though I am clearly pressing the correct number). I have sent a number of emails and the responses I get are simply an attempt to placate instead of actually being helpful. I have requested an update and I have requested information about when my bag will be delivered, but they fail to answer this question, they simply deflect and say the bag is with their delivery agent, they do not provide any information beyond what I already know, and they do not appear interested in helping to resolve a problem they created.

### "I will never travel with them again"
My flight was cancelled on the day before departure from Copenhagen. I was given no other option than getting a voucher or a refund, since Transavia did not have any other flights within the next 3 days. Now I am left with the expense of a alternative ticket and Transavia, which refuses to cover anything - having at no time documented any of their claims. Transavia is an airline which cannot be trusted and I will never travel with them again. Advising anyone reading not to do so either.

### "customer service has been amazing"
Not Verified |  I flew with Transavia last July - best flight I have taken for years. Perfect service and on time. Clean aircraft. OK food was basic - but what do you expect in eco for a shortish Eurohop? I also booked to go to Jordan - had to cancel because of my wife having an accident. Needed docs for insurance purposes, something which is usually a real pain. Transavia customer service has been amazing. I have received everything promptly which I needed. And by promptly I mean often that day or very soon after. I hoped to be writing a review of the Jordan flight - sadly I cannot do that yet. However, when my wife recovers, we will be flying with Transavia if we can.

### "the 2nd incident in 2 years"
First flight from Innsbruck and we are already 70 minutes delayed. This is followed by another surprise seat change from Transavia despite paying the highest fare to secure flexibility and choice of seats. We checked in our luggage and were not informed of any seat change. However, when we were boarding the plane, we were notified that we had been shifted from Row 8 to Row 24. I told the air stewardess that we had paid for Row 8 but changed at the last minute without consent or prior notification, fortunately she took rectifying action. This is the 2nd incident in 2 years and if Transavia cannot deliver what clients paid for, there should be a way for customers to be compensated.

### "We had a terrible experience"
Not Verified |  We had a terrible experience traveling on Jan 5-8th with our service dog. Our flight on Jan 8th was delayed and we were sent from one check-in area to another. Despite arriving 2 hours early, we were told the check-in was closed and had to take another flight. We came back the next day, and had to wait for 3.5 hours for the service dog to be allowed on the flight, then 1 minute before departure they told us the dog is allowed and they made a mistake. We were not given any options for accommodation or compensation for the time lost.

### "lack of honesty and professionalism"
Not Verified | My flight got cancelled and I was rebooked on a later flight without any notification from the company. I wrote a complaint to explain I could not take a later flight and needed to then go earlier and to ask for a compensation for my wasted train ticket and the extra hotel night I was going to have to book. They refused, arguing that they had sent me a notification e-mail few days before (no evidence of this supposed e-mail of course) and that they were not required to do anything for me since I "was notified more than 14 days before flight). Amazing lack of honesty and professionalism here.

### "Transavia cancelled my flight without notice"
Not Verified |  Transavia cancelled my flight without notice, stranding me in Thessaloniki. Over the course of several calls and a dozen complaint filings, they have claimed that I was sent a cancellation notice, then said that I was *not* sent a cancellation notice, and then said that actually, they didn't cancel the flight, that it was actually Delta (with whom I booked the flight). Obviously, these things cannot all be true, and Transavia has adopted a business model of lying to its customers. I wasn't able to get to my destination, and am now out hundreds of dollars for rebooked travel and lodging. Do not fly with this shady outfit, they are unscrupulous and will screw you over.

### "no discount for flight changes"
Amsterdam to Pisa, at 10:20, gate closes at 10:05. We enter the controls at Amsterdam Schiphol Airport at 8:30, we leave at 10:00, at 10:08 we arrive at the gate. They were intransigent (even knowing that we had been at the controls since 8:30. No refunds, no discount for flight changes.

### "One of the worst airlines"
One of the worst airlines I've travelled with when it comes to service and onboard safety and comfort. I always have difficulty breathing while on their flight. I never have this problem with other airline. This time, since I'm 5 months pregnant, I asked for oxygen and they refused to give it to me, repeatedly. Me and my husband asked them for oxygen over 5 times and they told us that, unless I'm passing out or visually suffering, they will not give me oxygen. Then they proceeded in giving cold towels claiming I'm just over heating.

### "Nice flight with a cheerful crew"
Not Verified | Nice flight with a cheerful crew who managed to create a little bit of a warm hospitable atmosphere. Yes, it is a typical low cost experience, but not too bad. Short delay and a smooth landing. I was spoiled being allocated an emergency exit seat for the four hours flight however. Thank you!

### "service was incredibly good"
Staff and service was incredibly good, especially in a difficult time as no due to staff shortage. I’m getting married in Spain soon and I took a flight yesterday from Rotterdam to Malaga in the morning, HV5023. I was carrying my dress and was very nervous about keeping it well during the flight. The staff was really helpful and kind. It already started at Rotterdam airport while checking in. Also during the flight everyone was taking good care of us and the rest of the passengers! Big shout out to this incredible team! Thank you so much! You gave us an amazing experience!

### "seat was very uncomfortable"
Very bad airline that falls under KLM. On the way there was a rude head stewardess who refused to do the safety demonstrations in English and did not speak English on the flight. So someone who doesn't understand Dutch doesn't know what to do. It is known that Dutch flight attendants have a very cold/rude attitude, also on this flight from Transavia and Stewards aboard with no experience. People who think to pay 9 euros extra to be sure that you can take luggage with you are wrong. Most of them still had to drop off their luggage. Food & beverages are extremely expensive. For 1 sandwich you already pay almost 10 euros. I would not recommend this airlines for flight for over 1.5 hours. The seat was very uncomfortable and extremely small.

### "felt in good hands at all times"
Short no-frills hop, for which I had to check in four hours in advance because of the current disgraceful situation at Schiphol. Extremely efficient self check-in process for luggage. For the flight itself, I didn’t expect much and I didn’t get anything, except the necessary and most important: I reached my destination safely. Very professional crew with clear safety announcements. Definitely felt in good hands at all times.

### "never use this airline anymore"
Not Verified |  No online boarding which led to an hour and a half line to check in They took my hand luggage when boarding and told me that you need to pay extra if you want to be sure to have it on board (never got this information beforehand) . The aircraft members were so rude and treated me so badly with a very arrogant tone. Then I had to carry my heavy computer in my hands and they didn't offered me even a bag to transport it. I had 5 hours transit time between my flights and had to carry this laptop everywhere. They really don't care about the comfort of their passengers and just want to make extra money whenever they want. On top of that, my luggage was lost and not registered on my next flight when I asked the airline to check it out. I've been really lucky to find it at my destination but no proper follow up was possible. I will never use this airline anymore.

### "Better spend a bit more to get a decent airline"
Not Verified |  Checked my luggage even though I explicitly do not want my luggage in checked luggage as it can get damaged and I have to wait to pick it up. Also made comments about me being late, even though I was in the boarding queue, but they messed up cabin luggage and had to get my carry on luggage a label, which was also messed up. Better spend a bit more to get a decent airline.

### "Overall can’t really complain"
Booked KLM Cork to Seville via Amsterdam with Amsterdam Seville legs flown with Transavia. Overall can’t really complain. They are effectively the charter leg of KLM and as such pretty much like most charters. Unlike KLM legs any food /drink was purchase only, didn’t buy anything but prices were reasonable. Seats were pretty standard legroom not great not poor …. I kinda liked the green leather though some may find it a bit garish. Most reviews not great but I found them fine. On time crews were again really friendly and polite, worked hard to help passengers find luggage space . Also special mention to the Transavia guy in Seville who noticed my lad had a football he had purchased. He told us it needed to be deflated a little to compensate for aircraft pressure. We had nothing to deflate it with but he asked a lady in the check in queue for her hair clip and then spent 10 minutes using this to get it deflated - much to the amusement of the waiting passengers! All done with a smile so while others may have issues we had a positive experience so feel that deserves to be said. I travel a lot and often think we are very quick to criticise (myself included) but when things go well then maybe not so quick to acknowledge!

### "my kudos to Transavia"
We were supposed to fly from Corfu, to Paris Orly airport and catch a connection from Paris Orly to Biarritz. We had two hours for the connection in Paris, which was tight since we had to retrieve our luggage and register them again. This was very clear from the beginning when I bought the tickets, so no question about it. Because of chaotic conditions in Corfu (widely understaffed for the first big summer vacation week end since Covid), we departed 2 hours late. The captain was good at communicating about the situation. I inquired with the cabin crew about my very short connection. Since I purchased the extra insurance to cover any travel interruption  he told me that their mission was to take us and our luggage to the final destination. As we were flying over Italy, the captain was able to communicate with the ground crew in Paris about our situation, the cabin crew checked our boarding pass for next flight, asked me about the color, size and brand of our luggage. We deboarded the plane and waited  outside the plane door as the cleaning crew was inside. Ground crew personally confirmed our luggage has been identified and was staying inside the plane. We then started boarding again with the new flight crew. So despite all the negative feedback that can be posted about low cost airlines, I am sending my kudos to Transavia with a stellar rating.

### "most uncomfortable flight"
The worst airline ever. I traveled with this company back and forth from Tel Aviv to Paris. Both flights had delays of over two hours, the staff behaved appallingly, bad service, poor speech. The seat is the smallest and most uncomfortable flight I have ever been on, not recommended at all.

### "no alternative flights are offered"
Booked round trip flights from Amsterdam to Riga for a group of 17. Flights were booked 5 months in advance. 1 month before the flight Transavia informs me by e-mail that the flights are cancelled. Called them and was told by agents no alternative flights are offered. The only option is a refund. Alternative flights to Riga are currently 300 euros more expensive than what we paid at the time of booking. This means the actions of transavia resulted in 5000 (17*300) euro damage for us. Never again!

### "horrible customer service"
If you want horrible customer service and mediocre flights this is the airline for you. They can cancel or change your flight and provide no compensation; we had our original flight at 8:25pm and got moved to a 2pm flight which ruined our whole plan - when we contacted to change the flight at least to the next day they said it was not available, when we ask to book us on an available KLM flight (Transavia is owned by KLM-Airfrance) our phone was cut and our email + form were just ignored (14 days and counting). The customer service will either pick up your call and pretend to not hear you. The funny thing is they put us on a KLM plane on our flight here (not communicated at all and last minute; I wonder how they could suddenly book that). There is no way to sugarcoat it, it is a horrible airline that is extremely overpriced for the service you get.

### "almost everything went very well"
When I first booked Transavia (France) I was very scared because of bad reviews I had read. To my surprise almost everything went very well. There was no problem with putting my 10kg luggage in a hold for free. Flight attendants were very nice. I had a lot of space for legs and my stuff (my height is 161 cm, my boyfriend's height is 180 cm he could fit comfortably as well). The only inconvenience we had was a 45 minutes delay, because we had to wait for a free slot to be able to take-off. However, the pilot managed to land quicker than planned so the delay was even shorter. In general I enjoyed my flight and I would decide to book Transavia France again.

### "I will never book with this company again"
No ethics or decency. I had to cancel my flight 2 hours after booking because of family logistics and book a flight from Nantes airport instead of Paris. They would not refund the 277€, exchange the flight or even re-instate the original flight. It was an honest mistake and I have paid dearly for it. I will never book with this company again and urge others not to also. A company that has no decency should be boycotted because these companies abuse our trust and take our hard earned money for absolutely nothing. That’s not the way this world should be. Profiting off of peoples mistakes or misfortunes. To me that was a lot of money. I would rather drive 18 hours than fly with one of these unethical companies ever again.

### "the worst airline experience I’ve ever had"
Not Verified |  This airline has provided me with the worst airline experience I’ve ever had. I travel a fair amount and have had my share of bad luck but this company wins the prize for biggest let down ever! Booked a flight directly on the website because I know that’s the best thing to do in case there’s an issue. Not so with this airline. After the slowest check-in experience I’ve ever had I finally find myself at the front of the line. I had everything that is needed for a normal airline to check in “the online and app check in was down which should have been my first red flag”. When I get to the counter the girl tells me I’m not booked on this flight. How can this be! I had everything I needed to prove that I was. The flight was 10.15am. Turns out Transavia changed my booking at 8.25am the same morning of my flight because they could not accommodate their overbooking. My new flight was 3 days later! I don’t think I need to say anymore. I could go on and on about how their customer service is the most lacklustre I’ve ever seen but I think by now you get the point.

### "Never again Transavia"
Not Verified |  Two days before departure we got a message 'sorry your flight is cancelled'. They do not offer any more information. You have to look for other flights so we had to book by another company, paying by ourselves. We had to fly to another destination, first take the train from Sevilla to Malaga (over 2 hours), staying 1 night in Malaga, afterwards with a flight to Antwerp and afterwards by taxi to Eindhoven. (our car was parked at the airport) Taxi drive over 200€. Never again Transavia, that's for sure.

### "no cleaning of the plane has been done"
Flight started with severely disorganized and chaotic boarding process. We had paid extra for priority boarding only to hear at the gate that no priority boarding is supposed to happen on this flight (at least we were pushed to the head of the queue afterwards, but WTH?) The boarding itself apparently was started before the plane has even landed after its previous flight. As a result, the entire passenger queue, already after passing the passes control, has been waiting for another 20 minutes standing and waiting while the plane was being unloaded. Obviously, no cleaning of the plane has been done - we have found some used napkins on our seats. Speaking of the seats, those were extremely uncomfortable. They did have an average leg space for a low-cost, I'll give them that, but they had no proper head support and did not provide proper back support either. The armrests could only have been raised halfway, so you had a choice to either feel them at your sides or at your shoulders (normally we would just push the armrest between our seats up and fly without). I've even witnessed one of our fellow passengers standing up at the aisle for a while to read and rest from these seats. Now I'm writing this from home with severe back pain that I've experienced for the first time in my life after this flight and I blame the seats. For the reference, the specific plane was PH-HZX. Curiously enough, the first flight (AMS-SVQ) didn't have these issues - the only thing I can whine about was the long queuing time at the airport, but I expected nothing better during the holiday season anyway. In any case, now my stance towards the airline is never again, unless I'm really forced to.

### "flying with you annually for the past 7 years. Never again"
I have never been so offended by a service provider as this airline. First off, does this company even exist, as far as customer service is concerned, apart from over the phone? There is certainly no customer service at their counter at Schiphol airport. I was just told to get in touch by phone. A ticket I had purchased with them allows me to rebook my flight any number of times during a period of one year. The flight was initially booked for December 2021 but had to be rebooked when the Netherlands went into hard lockdown. I could not rebook the flight for the desired date of December 2022 as the airline had no flight schedule in place for the winter 2022 season. I was therefore forced to rebook the ticket to an unwanted date (March 2022). Come March 2022, their schedule was still not out so I had to rebook to another unwanted date (April 2022), so as not to lose the ticket, incurring extra charges on both occasions, all for no purpose. As the (unwanted) flight date drew near, and, with a winter 2022 schedule still not out and no more available dates left to book past April 2022, I contacted the airline to ask for a voucher/credit but was denied one, resulting in the ticket being forfeited. A customer forfeiting a ticket because of administrative issues i.e. being forced to book unwanted dates only to forfeit the ticket? I have a right to a booking, to hold on to that booking, and to rebook my flight to the desired date. None of those rights have been respected. International flights can be booked a year in advance, apparently not in this instance. What do you call it when an airline forces you to book unwanted dates and incur extra charges only to forfeit your ticket. I have a term for it. Let the reader judge. What makes it worse is their agents’ unprofessionalism and/or deliberate evasion of the subject matter. When I asked them for a voucher and pointed out there were no more dates to rebook their responses, included, for example: "I understand your situation, however, as per company policies we won't be able to offer you a voucher. Our winter season flight will be out towards the end of April. However, once (they mean “since”) the flight is booked for tomorrow, if you do not want to lose the ticket, please change the route and date of your ticket. You can try and change it for October, so you do not have to change it again before the winter season flights are out.” This is just one example of the astonishing drivel I have received as a response. How can I change the flight for October if there are no flights in October, the subject matter being the Dubai-Amsterdam leg? How can I even “change it again (in April I assume) before the winter season flights are out” when there are no more flights dates left to rebook to? And even if there were, just to incur unnecessary costs? Is this deliberate evasion of the topic or lack of knowledge or what? Not only am I unnecessarily out of pocket, I’m without recourse, having contacted every relevant body. Thank you Transavia. I’ve been flying with you annually for the past 7 years. Never again.

### "definitely fly again with Transavia"
Typical lcc. Booking process is very convenient. Changing reservations is no problem, even when using the telephone hotline. There is no waiting time, and they are very helpful and friendly! Departure was only slightly delayed, cabin staff was very friendly. The atmosphere was relaxing and professional. The food is not too expensive and of acceptable quality. Will definitely fly again with Transavia!

### "intend to survive being non-ethical"
It was going to be my first flight with this airline, and I was looking forward having this experience, as they belong to AF/KL group and have many flights in Europe. A couple of weeks after buying my non-refundable ticket, they canceled the flight. They offered a new flight, that was not suitable to me, as well a the refund option, that I chose. They inform they would refund within 2 weeks. The following weeks, they went on sending the same information about flight cancelation, and I could check my reservation had not been cancelled. They did not refund me. Suddenly i received an email remembering check-in policies. Therefore I called their "service center", that was quick to answer. They indeed then cancelled my reservation, and said I would receive a refund within 2 weeks. Immediately after my call, I received an email from Transavia stating that I had decided to cancel a non-refundable reservation, and therefore would not be allowed to refund. I called again, and they said they kind-of fixed it. Then I received an email, informing of a refund on process. So far, no money; I understand that airline suffers from financial troubles. However, I wonder how they intend to survive being non-ethical. They are cutting the branch where they are sitting. Air travel is a matter of trust. We trust that we are dealing with safe and honest service provider. If they fail in being fair with us, it is the whole image which is damaged.

### "I will avoid this airline in the future"
The airline is fine if there is not a problem, if you don’t mind many needless indignities and discomforts, but it’s a terrible airline if anything goes wrong. Just experienced a two hour delay due to a late arriving aircraft and there was no communication from the airline, nothing on the airport screens, and no information available through the app or flight tracking sites. Even the delayed incoming flight could not be found. When arriving at Orly, the buses us into a non-Schengen gate, where we all had to go through passport control despite this being a Schengen area flight. Bags also took a long time to be delivered. The crew is nice, but the seats are cramped and the cabin was filthy. The fare we paid was the same as Air France on the same route, even though it’s sold on the same website, belies the complete lack of services. I will avoid this airline in the future.

### "this shows their lack of professionalism"
Not Verified |  On the day 12th of January 2022, we had a flight from Amsterdam to Reykjavik at 16:45 - Flight HV 6887. This flight was canceled due the weather conditions in Iceland. In order to enter Iceland, we had to do an antigen test prior 72h the entry to the country. Our country of origin was Spain, where we paid €40 for two antigen tests, then we spent two days in Amsterdam and everything was planned in order to have the test still valid to travel to Iceland. Obviously we never took into consideration that our flight was going to be canceled and since that happened, we asked to a lady at Transavia’s counter if we had to repeat the test and her answer was “no, your test will still be valid”. The next day, when we managed to get to Schiphol Airport, we went again to ask at the Transavia’s counter to make sure if we had to do the test, and this time the answer was “yes, otherwise you might not be able to enter in Iceland”. So we repeated the test, which cost us €116. I emailed them that the fact that we had to repeat the test wasn’t our fault and if there was any chance to get a refund, and I didn’t get an answer in more than two months, the first email I sent was on the 13th of January, then again on the 21st of January (no answer from them) and again out the 15th of March, when I’ve been told that they couldn’t do anything because the flight was canceled due the weather conditions. What upsets me the most is the fact that two of their operators gave me two different answers, I’ve never got any apologies from them about this whole situation and they took more than two months to give me an answer. The final answer I’ve got was after five days that I’ve sent them the second reminder. They don’t seem to care much about their customers and it seems that they’re not really trained to deal with a situation like the one I had, this shows their lack of professionalism and it’s the reason why I will never travel with them again.

### "they didn't have the time to let her in"
Not Verified |  My mother went to the airport 3 hours before the departure of her flight, and she did her check-in on time. She waited in the lounge for the departure, she showed up at the gate at 15min before the departure. The flight crew forbids her to enter the flight stating that the gate was closed, they also told her she can take the next flight without having to pay. They had time to go take the luggage out of the plane, but they didn't have the time to let her in! There weren't any LAST CALL for the flight at the airport. On the gate, they said they asked for her at the lounge. I tried to call the customer service, the woman said that is written on the boarding pass that passengers should show up at the gate at least 30min before the flight, when it actually says that the boarding starts 30min before the flight.

### "impossible to communicate with them"
Please stay away from this airline. It is impossible to communicate with them. Messages are not answered, phones are not working. We booked the flight for 28/12 but when we checked their schedule, this flight is not scheduled anymore apparently being cancelled. Nobody notified us and it is impossible to confirm or not confirm cancellation.

### "This company does not value customers"
Transavia treated us terribly. From the ticket agent who rudely declared we couldn’t fly (because she couldn’t communicate the document they needed) to the mechanical issues that forced us to deplane after boarding to the way that they crammed us into a bus and forced us to stand together like sardines for an hour on the tarmac, this was one of the worst airline experiences of my entire life. This company does not value customers. I don’t care how cheap they are, I’ll never fly with them again.

### "did nothing to enforce covid regulations"
Not Verified | Dirty old aircraft, extremely uncomfortable despite having an entire row to myself due to the seat design. Cabin crew friendly enough but did nothing to enforce covid regulations. I was seated opposite a customer with her unmasked nose on display and it remained like that for the rest of the flight. She wasn't the only one and cabin crew said nothing to anyone. They spent most of the flight hiding behind a curtain. The aircraft was also disgustingly dirty and had obviously been in this state for some time. Transavia also refuse to take cash which means you need to have a card they accept to buy any of their low quality, overpriced refreshments. They also made some weird announcement about people not being able to take pictures or video onboard. Obviously an attempt to cover up their lack of cleanliness and safety.

### "Lost baggage and then no help"
Lost baggage and then no help. First time flyer with Transavia and wouldn’t again. The flight itself was fine, nice plane although maybes a little dirty and lovely flight staff. If something goes wrong though you’re on your own. My checked suitcase didn’t leave the airport with us and it took 7 days before they found it. Now an unclaimed large suitcase sitting in an airport for 7 days just wouldn’t happen. I assume that they don’t make any effort and wait for someone else to ask if the luggage is one of their passengers. Once found now on my 3rd week and back home, we’re no where near getting our belongings back. I’m being told to wait with no approximate timescale such as days, weeks, months before they can get it back to me. I’m not even sure I’ll get it back. And as others have said, claiming expenses for essentials while you’re on holiday with none of your belongings is met with misplaced emails that miraculously appear after a lengthy phone call. Then you get a response asking for more information. Come on Transavia, mistakes happen which aren’t in your control but you don’t need to do much to make your customers feel cared for. Can someone please just help.

### "delays in both flights"
Transavia managed to have delays in both flights, dirty cabin and extremely long waiting times for luggage. For the price you pay it's ridiculous service.

### "they won’t let us board"
I arrived at 5am, an hour and 15 min before gate closing. We mentioned this to the staff who seemed on oblivious. 50 minutes in line only to be told they won’t let us board. We did not need to deposit bags just pick up our boarding pass. This is now 10 to 6. The monitor showed they are still boarding and terminal one in Schiphol isn’t big. No one gave us warnings even tho they claimed they did. Meanwhile the screens still say boarding. We walk over to customer service, they were telling us we can’t board we can clearly see calls for boarding than final call. Easy could have made. Worst case scenario we won’t get it and I still have to buy a second ticket. Which we did but not by them cuz they said they they didn’t have any but we found tickets tickets cheaper on another site for way cheaper. I paid 330 euro one way. This cost me 200 for me and my gf. It also wasted our day of our life The counter ladies were seven more rude. Not attempting to help us and even laughing at us and talking down at us like children. While Transavia is a budget airline I never felt this frustrated at the lack of effort and empathy to help it’s clients.

### "avoid this airline in future"
This is the worst airline I’ve ever flown. No mask enforcement. Over 1 hour 30 mins late departure. No apology, no explanation at check in. There were two agents checking boarding passes at the gate with a scanner. There was no checking of EU covid passport details. The Faro flight was combined with the Seville flight and all passengers had to checked manually. Appalling service. Have never experienced such a farce on any other low cost airline. I will actively avoid this airline in future.

### "Chose this airline because it is only direct flight to Amsterdam"
Chose this airline because it is only direct flight to Amsterdam. Little did we know they are notorious to tell you once you are onboard, you are going to fly to another island to pick up more passengers (making up excuses that another flight on that island had a long inspection). So now we are traveling for two hours longer. Two take offs two landings, sitting on the plane while they pack up the flight to a max, then refuel). I guess it’s too expensive for them to fly two half empty planes, do they are going to make you pay for it. Unbelievable! Glad we don’t have a connection in Amsterdam.

### "not wearing their masks properly"
Not Verified |  Passengers and crew not wearing their masks properly. Crew removed mask to shout in the middle of the airplane. Unacceptable behavior. Avoid at all cost.

### "there were so many other passengers not wearing their masks properly"
This is the third time I have flown Transavia since Covid entered our world. Twice (round trip Paris-Crete) and recently from Paris to Tivat (Montenegro). Each time despite making repeated announcements in various languages about how mask wearing is mandatory, the stewards/esses walk by the people with masks around their necks or their noses out and don't say a word. The photos below are the men across from me at the start of the flight and towards the end. As you can see no change over a 2.5 hour journey. And these photos are the ones I managed to take discretely - there were so many other passengers not wearing their masks properly.

### "I would recommend this airline"
First time flying Transavia. Flight departed on time and we landed 30 mins earlier so that was great. Boarding went really fast. Flight was quite full but not fully booked. The seats were comfortable but there wasn’t a lot of legroom. There was catering on board. Staff was really friendly. I would recommend this airline. I paid €65 without luggage for this flight.

### "was denied a service I had paid for"
I arrived at checkin at 08.30 with the flight departing at 9.15. The employee receiving me at the waiting line informed me that he can't let me proceed to the check-in desk because it is closed. I objected letting him know that it is 45 minutes before the flight and that there is still time to board the plain. I later found out at the Transavia website that the formal SLA is 40 minutes, so he had no right to deny me entrance on that excuse. I convinced him to let me proceed to the desk. While waiting in front of the desk for a decision there was a lot of back and forth between the employee appearing to be in charge next to the desk and the boarding gate. They finally reached the decision to let me in as I was on time. Upon inspecting my PCR test (as an email on my phone), the employee at the desk clicked on a link directing him to the Dutch government website instead of the attached PDF containing the PCR test. In this confusion his instinctive response was to tell me that Transavia doesn't accept this test, although he wasn't looking at the actual PCR certificate but a government web page. I complained saying that I had used Transavia's services 3 months ago with a PCR test from the same authority. Without any sign of self-doubt or hesitation he informed the person in charge that my PCR was invalid. I was directed to the help desk and talked to the employee there. She asked how much I paid for my certificate and where I had received it. She then proceeded to acknowledge that my PCR was valid and we went together back to the checkin desk. After, informing the staff that they had bounced me off for no reason 10 minutes ago and that they should have let me in, they reverted back to the argument that I had arrived too late anyway. Of course at that point it was indeed too late. So, I guess from my point of view I arrived 5 min before the checkin formally closes with a valid PCR certificate and was denied a service I had paid for. The worst part is that nobody seemed to bother too much about it let alone utter an apology. They were behaving like it is another day at the office and that it sucks for me but rules are rules. Bouncing off people like that might be ok if we are talking about trains or buses because you can catch the next one. I would expect airline employees to be a little more considerate especially during those times.

### "Never again Transavia"
Not Verified |  Truly dramatic service and conditions. Never again Transavia. Despite Corona, which prevented us from traveling to an area (Italy) in October 2020, Transavia refused to change or cancel the flight without charge. This while that is simply a European obligation. So rebooked with costs anyway. Unfortunately still corona, April 2021. Again, Transavia says that it is not possible to change a basic ticket. Moreover, changes are not even possible on the site, because additional taxes have come from costs that have to be paid again first. The lady rattles on, I cannot intervene, without listening that due to corona the airlines have to give vouchers or money back.

### "has the worst customer service"
This airline has the worst customer service I have ever encountered. They are absurd, inefficient, and so hypocritical. I do not recommend them unless you're really desperate and their fare is really competitive. Otherwise, please do yourself a huge favor and fly with literally anyone else.

### "Terrible overall customer service"
July 1, 2020 we were supposed to arrive in Paris, however we were unable to travel into Europe by Europe rules due to pandemic. Paris also had a 2 week quarantine rule. I reached out to the airline multiple times before and after (it's now been 4 months after). It was impossible for us to get onto the Paris - Athens flight due to European rules. We had 5 total flights for our month long trip and all of our flights have been refunded except Transavia. I want our $522 refunded, they would only refund the $66 taxes. When we finally do get to travel we will even pay more to travel a different airline. Terrible overall customer service - we didn't get to take flight at all.

### "Worst customer service"
Worst customer service. I requested a refund for canceled tickets and i told them that the original account is closed. They said get us a paper that its closed so we can transfer to a new one, i did and then they transfered to the closed account anyways. They then asked for another paper and when i got it, they said we cant help we already transfered the money. First of all, no money has reached the closed account and now they want to do the same thing to me with another canceled flight. They have literally been the worst customer service i ever dealt with. I recommend everyone stay away from Transavia because they don't care about your money, they will rob you and then reply to your emails by ignoring you and ignoring everything you were talking about.

### "doesn’t allow for online check-in"
The flight left before the scheduled time and arrived well ahead, which is always great. The aircraft was very clean and staff was nice. But Transavia doesn’t allow for online check-in, which, given the circumstances, makes even less sense than normal. Also, lines for the Paris flights were mixed.

### "Worst user experience"
Worst user experience through their website and customer service of all airlines I've ever used. After they changed my flight time, I messaged them a thousand times. After no response, I called them and confirmed my flight change. However, my booking details have not changed and I'm supposed to fly in 3 days. Unacceptable customer service and the current circumstances are not an excuse anymore: other airlines have treated me professionally and with respect.

### "Disgrace and very rude"
I'm calling the airline just now, had to wait 45 minutes, asked about the PCR test, operator acts as if he never heard about it. I say  you sell trips to Greece , so you must know what are the conditions, and he hangs up the phone. For weeks on end, there are waiting lines for 50-60 minutes, and they never fix it. Disgrace and very rude. Customer unfriendly.

### "I will fly with them again "
Not Verified | Flew Transavia from Athens to Amsterdam in February 2020. It was a lovely flight and I complement the crew on a job well done. I will fly with them again in the future.

### "seats are not very clean"
We paid extra and booked the exit row seats, which the Transavia website said was possible if children 12 to 16 are accompanied by an adult. However, when we arrived at the airport, we were told that we could not have the exit row seat as my son was 12 and that Transavia had changed our seats to another standard row. I told the ground staff that the website had indicated it was possible, which is the reason for us booking. This resulted in some confusion but we managed to get the seats that we paid for eventually. This is the 2nd time that Transavia had shifted us without consent, and both times, we had to rectify. I think that shifting passenger seats without prior consent is highly unprofessional as this is preventing people from getting what they paid for. Onboard, the exit row had decent leg room. The seats are not very clean because they provided us with disinfectant wipes to wipe down our seats ourselves. I saw the prior's customer's dirty disinfectant wipe still in the pocket of my seat.

### "standard seats had very narrow leg room"
At boarding, we were told that our face masks could not be used to board Transavia, as it had a valve design. Whilst it was only a design, it was still not allowed and we had to get new facemasks. Upon boarding, we were given a disinfectant tissue in a packet. I noted crumbs on the seat, which indicated that the plane was not cleaned prior to us boarding. We were lucky enough to be seated at row 1, where we had good leg room. The other standard seats had very narrow leg room. We had to pay for food and drinks, and the menu was similar to Transavia flights pre-pandemic. Only card payments are accepted - no cash. Overall, the short flight was OK. The flight was not that full, and there was good social distance between passenger groups. A face mask without a valve or valve design is required for flights on Transavia

### "Luggage arrived three days late"
Luggage arrived three days late due to chaotic check-in at Amsterdam. My pregnant wife had to stand for 2.5 hours to check-in. In Porto we waited another two hours before a ground agent condescended to accept the report. We incurred costs replacing clothes and toiletries. I am insured to cover this but I have to claim on Transavia first which is impossible.

### "Used napkins in pocket"
Online check-in wasn’t possible because of codeshare flight (transavia/KLM). Used napkins in pocket in front of me and broken closing of air conditioner almost froze me and other passengers around me.

### "has very reasonable prices"
Transavia has very reasonable prices for a direct flight without luggage, and does no rip you off for the “extra services”. The Seats are perfectly acceptable, the cabin is neat and clean, and that i could notice there is no excursions from a security and safety standard. The flight was on time on departure and arrival.

### "stuck with something I don't need"
Not Verified | Had some booking options open in multiple tabs. Decided on one of the configurations and clicked OK on that page to a certain price. Their site took the most expensive configuration from my tabs and now I'm stuck with something I don't need. After waiting an hour and a half in a customer service queue, they said they couldn't help me. Never flying with Transavia again and would strongly advise anyone else to never use them!

### "still waiting a voucher"
I flew Transavia couple of times, service and quality of aircraft os just acceptable. The issue is with their customer service, especially when you have issues related to COVID. They are unable to issue vouchers and refunds, they do not answer messages. They canceled my flight and they made it available again 3 days later for double the price. After 2+months from the cancellation I am still waiting a voucher, a refund or just an answer from their customer service. Never again with Transavia. I am frequent flyer, platinum with Klm and Senator with Lufthansa.

### "terrible coronavirus safety net"
Not Verified | Transavia has a terrible coronavirus safety net. The European Union isn’t allowing United States citizens to travel. I should be able to receive a full refund in this case. I can only rebook my flight to the same destination by March 1. Most other airlines provide you with a credit you can use 1-2 years from your original booking. Why can I only rebook until March?? My flight was supposed to be in the summer when I have off from work, so I can’t even reschedule the flight to a time I am available. I will never book with this airline again.

### "they deny to give the refund"
Not Verified |  Transavia has an awful service and policy during Corona virus, they deny to give the refund of the cancelled flights, and the only option they give to the customers is the voucher. According to the E.U.law,the customer has the choice of choosing the refund or the voucher. meanwhile they dont give any guarantee in case of bankruptcy.

### "they refuse to give cash refund"
Don't book more flights with this company. Just booked a flight from Amsterdam to Porto and just after 4 days the flight gets cancelled and they refuse to give cash refund. This is stealing money from the customers. They keep excusing on Covid-19 crisis but there are no rules from government specifying that I can't fly from Netherlands to Portugal. In fact there are another airlines flying there at momment.

### "Will never fly Transavia again"
Innsbruck to Amsterdam. We received an email that the flight was delayed by 2 hours. We were then told by the ground staff to be around the airport, in case a plane became available- but of course, that did not happen. On board, food is not complimentary. Transavia sells itself as a budget carrier but it really is not. Return flights cost over €800 per person for 90 minutes flight within Europe, and we still had to pay for food. What it really is - a small airline with small aircraft that scalps passengers but provides budget service. We also got different seats on our printed boarding passes and our online boarding passes. They can’t even get the seats right. Will never fly Transavia again.

### "extremely uncomfortable seats"
Transavia has the only direct flights between Amsterdam and Innsbruck. For the 1.5 hour flight, it cost over €800 per person inclusive of hold luggage and seat selection. At check in, the queues to check in were short - although the airport is not busy with the travel bans. At the gate, we received an email that our flight will depart 17 minutes later (at 1pm). The plane only started reversing at 1.25pm. 40 minutes after the plane was supposed to take off. On board, the seats are a strange green with very little leg room. Given the cost for the 1.5 hour flight, we felt thoroughly cheated - we were packed like sheep going to the slaughterhouse. There wasn’t even a window for our row (row 12). Mid-flight, the food trolley came past and over priced snacks were available for purchase - yes, despite the cost of the flight. Landing in Innsbruck, we seemed to be prioritized behind Austrian airlines when it came to baggage claim (even though we arrived first). We will never fly Transavia again. Even though it has the only direct flight to Innsbruck, the delays, extremely uncomfortable seats and lack of window makes it not worthwhile. If we had flown to Germany and then drove in, we would have arrived at the same time anyway.

### "never landed on time"
Amsterdam to Malaga. Flying at least every 2 weeks for the past 1 years and never landed on time. The usual amount of delay is at least half an hour every flights and today we are already delayed in Amsterdam for at least half an hour again due to the incompetence for not finishing the boarding in time.

### "not always low on cost"
Not Verified | Amsterdam to Thessaloniki. I travel frequently to Greece to visit my family and I use Transavia since it’s the only direct flight to my hometown out of Amsterdam. I am generally happy with the service since I do know what to expect although for the record it is not always low on cost.

### "so disappointed with this airline"
Barcelona to Amsterdam. Never again! I am so disappointed with this airline. I am a single mom, i sent my child with the accompanied child service to visit his dad on holidays, what i got? The company lost my 5yr old child glasses during the flight, 300EUR glasses. Because he fellt asleep and they didn’t take all his belongings. I did all the procedures, the answer I got is if isn’t in lost and found that means it didn’t get lost in the flight. Of course he wore them to get into the flight. Never again.

### "usual amount of delay half an hour"
Amsterdam to Thessaloniki. Flying at least every 6-8 weeks for the past 2 years and i almost never landed on time. The usual amount of delay is at least half an hour in almost every of my flights and today we are already stuck in Amsterdam for at least half an hour again due to the incompetence for not finishing the boarding in time.

### "no free food or drinks"
Amsterdam to Tenerife. Awful service, no free food or drinks, only paid overpriced drinks and snacks. Old plane's infrastructure: seats very shabby! Also, the distance between seats is narrow: I am only 1.75 tall but my knees were stubborn into the front seat. No Wi-Fi, no intranet, no radio or TV.

### "not a low-cost company"
Amsterdam to Malaga. The only reason why I chose this company is that they have many routes. It is definitely not a low-cost company. Not worthy in terms of quality / service. Their luggage policies are extreme (even worse than Ryanair) and of course, you have to pay all on board. Often their flights are delayed (I have waited for 30 mins to 4 hours) and in general, the service is really bad. They sometimes don't explain to you even why all those delays. There is not much space for the legs (and I'm not very tall), they encourage you to "take all the trash with you " several times, no in-flight entertainment, rude hostess. As I said, I fly with them because is the easiest way to go to Spain from The Netherlands, but i always try to choose other companies if it is possible

### "Left my jacket in overhead locker"
Innsbruck to Amsterdam. Travelling back from holiday, very early start. Left my jacket in overhead locker. Unfortunately I could not get all my hand luggage etc into one locker and forget I left the jacket in another locker. We were one of the last people to leave the aircraft. I contacted airline help desk 30 minutes after arrival. They said the cleaners must have taken it. They didn’t care, took no details told me to contact loss and found in the airport. Which required me going out of the departure area finding the lost and found desk. They said I should really go via the airline. I said I did and they then directed me to the online form. Had to go through security again etc. Basically a complete waste of time. Lost a lovely light weight winter jacket £225 plus sunglasses £100.

### "never recommend Transavia"
Amsterdam to Reykjavik. The flight was delayed on the outbound journey, the plane was not clean, and some cabin staff were unprofessional. On the return flight, the flight was 2 hours 20 minutes delayed. We were offered 5 euros to buy a meal, but that only buys a cola? I would never recommend Transavia to people.

### "overall service is poor"
Chania to Amsterdam. This is by far the worst airline I have ever travelled with. When you want to check in online a day before, it is not possible to select enough seats because they want to reserve seats for people who want to check in at the airport. Arriving at the airport I asked if it was possible to get 2 seats so the person I am travelling with could sit next to me ... the person at the check in desk did not listen so I had to explain myself multiple times, just to hear that it was not possible. Note: there were still many people behind us who needed to check in so they did not have a seat yet. Furthermore the flight was delayed because they lost 4 pieces of luggage? The overall service is poor, I would recommend Ryanair over Transavia.

### "Crew was pleasant"
Heraklion to Eindhoven. Flight landed on time. Seats are very cramped on the newer airplanes of Transavia. No IFE on board. Crew was pleasant and correct. Prices for food and drinks weer average.

### "cabin crew were very good"
Eindhoven to Heraklion. Our flight from Heraklion was delayed by 6 hours due to a technical problem with the computer. Transavia promised us to compensate us within 2 weeks after filing a compensation report so thats great! Flight was OK, legroom was poor, but cabin crew were very good. Also the sandwich I bought was good and for 4 euros well priced.

### "book with a different airline"
Not Verified |  Pisa to Amsterdam. I do not recommend this airline. After having a three hour delay for my flight over to the Netherlands I didn't love the airline. After they cancelled our flight back to Pisa merely hours before we were supposed to board and leave without reason. When asked we were met with vague scrambled explanations and told there was no other option to fly back that day. Not only that, but they said they couldn't do anything for at least 48 hours! As a student who's studying abroad and needed to get back at least by Monday afternoon for class (which doesn't allow excused absences because of travel issues like most programs) I was very stressed. They finally after much arguing, to a representative who didn't even work for Transavia we were able to get a flight for Monday night .. which was delayed also. They did provide us with meal vouchers, though not enough to cover all of the meals we needed, and a nice hotel we still had to spend money on transportation to a different airport to fly home. This rant just barely covers what we had to deal with while traveling. I will be calling to get a refund. Definitely book with a different airline.

### "check-in policy is ridiculous"
Verona to Amsterdam. One-and-a-half-hour delay on the outbound flight and three-hour delay on the return flight. On top of that, the online check-in policy is ridiculous: there are only a fixed number of free seats. When those are reserved, either you pay 10€ for a seat, or you "conveniently" check-in at the airport desk. This experience with this company counts twice for me: first and last. Ryanair feels like Emirates compared to Transavia.

### "denying the cancellation"
Paris to Seville. I purchased two tickets for travel in September from JUSTFLY, where no-penalty 24-hour cancellation was clearly stated. Unfortunately when I then had to cancel, neither JUSTFLY nor Transavia honored the policy. JUSTFLY told me I had to contact the airline, but no one at JUSTFLY had the Transavia phone number; on the Transavia website it said I had to ask the booking agent for authorization to cancel. Transavia wrote me denying the cancellation. This is dreadfully deceptive practice.

### "such a poor service"
Amsterdam to Heraklion. Both flights were not very good. The food and drinks available were very limited. Some cabin staff could be more friendly. The plane was very warm - the air-conditioning was not good. The planes looked old. I also find the cost of Transavia flights very expensive for such a poor service, when compaired to EasyJet.

### "Horrendous luggage delivery"
Ibiza to Paris Orly. Horrendous luggage delivery at orly airport. 1 hour delay delivery despite plane landing 15 minutes ahead of time. Nobody from Transavia around to inform or manage. Being low cost does not mean Transavia can drop its end to end responsibility. Missing the basics of Customer service.

### "never boarded a Transavia plane"
At 1:30 am the day of departure for a 6:30 flight from Orly to Dublin I received an email confirming our flight and saying I could sign in. I tried to do that, but it wouldn’t go through. So I arrived at the Orly airport at 4:00am ready to fly, and when I showed the confirmation of our flight was told “ It’s not your fault. There is no flight to Dublin today. It’s tomorrow. Your boarding pass is correct, but there is no flight. Go to the Transavia counter.” There we were told to call a number to get a refund after 8:00 am. Our phones were not connecting in France, so impossible, and there is no public phone in the airport. And a refund was not what we wanted. We needed a flight to Dublin. So after pleading for help from the Transavia agent she used her personal phone to find us a flight to Dublin that day on AerLingus. We TRULY appreciated her help. Of course this flight cost 5 times what we had paid to Transavia, and also left from Charles DeGaulle airport. So we took a bus there costing an additional €40, and managed to get to our destination in time to spend a night in Dublin and catch a Norwegian flight to the USA the next day. I still have not received any communication from Transavia regarding this change of schedule. It’s like it didn’t happen from their end. That’s not all! As a previous reviewer wrote, the week before our Transavia flight from Dublin to Orly was cancelled due to the controllers strike (understandable) but again no assistance. We ended up flying to Brussels on Ryan Air and trained from there to Paris, once again at great expense. So two for two, and we’ve never boarded a Transavia plane! And getting to refund requires effort on my part. They know I paid and didn’t fly, so why can’t they automatically refund my credit card? Never Again.

### "an airline I will avoid"
Dublin to Paris. Flight cancelled because of the general strike in France. They sent me a link which did not work. Finally had to send a message through Facebook and their website and was told I had to wait 2-4 weeks to get my money back. In the meantime I had to book another flight with Air France (more expensive) but at least their service was great. As though this was not enough I received an email inviting me to check in for the cancelled flight and the next day an e mail as to what to do in Paris. After cancelling the flight they should at least take care not to send these annoying messages. This is an airline I will avoid from now on.

### "Lack of Communication"
My 2 friends and I flew first with KLM from Berlin to Amsterdam and then with Transavia from Amsterdam to Marrakesh (and back vice versa). Both trips with Transavia weren't 100% enjoyable due to the following reasons: 1. Lack of Communication on Luggage: before flying, there was no communication that there are differences in the hand luggage policy between KLM (1 pieces + accessory) and Transavia (1 piece). Yes, the additional hand luggage has been checked in by Transavia for free but an information beforehand would have been appreciated in order to consider packing in the first place. Reason provided by staff at airport "we're a low budget airline". Fair point - still created misunderstanding and negative experience. 2. Lack of Little Pleasantries: no free snack or beverage on a 3.5hrs flight 3. Lack of Visibility/Transparency on Flight Details: no possibility to check flight information online on website - reason provided by customer service: booking includes flights from 2 airlines (KLM & Transavia) 4. Lack of Communication: at airport in Marrakesh, at 6am, information screen stated that check-in counter is open, staff appeared at 6:45am (staff at airport only said that we've to wait) - it's okay to wait but then don't say that the check-in is open. In general, I have understanding for a lot of things but I'd just appreciate more communication and visibility on possible differences to other airlines up-front.

### "strict policy on 1 hand luggage"
Paris to Lisbon. Flight delayed by 1hr. Rough attitude from staff on the ground with strict policy on 1 hand luggage even if luggage fits size. Fast track service paid, useful when boarding but then chaos to the flight. Very disappointing and stressful situation not worth the saving in the price of the ticket. The company and staff need a bit more experience.

### "No sandwiches available"
Faro to Eindhoven. Left about half an hour late due to an oil spillage on the runway (not a fault of the airline). New aircraft with modern sky interior. Very tight and rock-hard seating, which led to an uncomfortable flight and back pain. Table was filthy, completely covered in coffee stains on the front and back. Asked the steward for a wet cloth and cleaned it ourselves. Flight departed at 18.30. No sandwiches whatsoever available (the plane had already made a return flight that day and catering was apparently not replenished). Also warm cheese sandwiches were sold out. So very little food items to choose from, which is unexceptable. Crew advised the passengers to send a complaint to customer services. Perhaps Transavia can also think of adding or changing their catering assortment onboard, beacuse it has been more or less the same (especially the sandwiches) for at least the past 10 years! A warm meal like other LCC's or even TUI offer for purchase could be an idea, also considering Transvia flies to far away destinations like Dubai. Cabin crew were friendly and flight calm and uneventful, but Transavia could make some effort in providing a better onboard experience.

### "useless ordeal"
Porto to Paris (Orly). Horrible flight, delayed, incompetent ground staff. First and last time flying with Transavia. Ground staff made several people send their hand luggage to the hold, claiming that the cabin would be full. In the end, over 30% of all cabin space was empty. In a flight that was already delayed by over an hour, this useless ordeal made us delayed a further 30 minutes.

### "cold and drafty"
Tenerife to Eindhoven. The cabin was extremely cold and drafty. Several passengers asked the crew to solve the problem, but it was neglected. The crew is working and keep warm, while the passengers sits still and get cold. It seems as they didn't understand and the problem was not solved. The crew was composed of very young and seemingly inexperienced persons. Several passengers including myself, had to put on our coats and huts to combat the coldness and draft. We had a second leg with Transavia with no problems though.

### "I was positively surprised"
I was positively surprised. I have flown with Ryanair and AirAsia a couple of times but Transavia is much better. We could choose a seat in front for free, the boarding went smooth, legroom was okay, food is reasonably priced and the cabin crew were very friendly. I got sick on the way to Marrakech and the crew immediately came to help me and gave me a free non sparkling coke, during the flight the asked me if I was okay two times. Would definitely choose Transavia again.

### " were more then professional"
Amsterdam to Porto. Thank you so much to all crew of the flight HV6001 from Amsterdam to Porto on the 31st January 2019. Besides offering me a sit with more space for my legs, they spared no effort in making me feel comfortable once I informed them I was suffering from migraine. The care they put in helping me was such that I ended up having a quite pleasant flight, despite my poor condition. They were more then professional. They really seemed to care. I wish I could find a better way to thank them.

### "very tired looking"
Paris Orly to Amsterdam Schipol with Transavia. We booked an extremely cheap flight of $59 dollars to get to Amsterdam for the weekend. The flight was smooth and only 55 minutes long, but the aircraft was old and clearly needed to be updated. It's not that it was not clean, it was just very tired looking.

### "disastrous quality of this airline"
Paris to Essaouira. I have used Transavia 3 times to various destinations. On the first flight, the airplane was about 1 hour late. The second time, the plane was again 1 hour late. However, the disastrous quality of this airline was best evidenced by my last trip. Before boarding the plane, the ground staff asked me to leave my cabin luggage before boarding the plane for the luggage to be checked in, despite the fact there was plenty of room in the overhead compartments. However, my luggage never arrived to the destination. Transavia provided poor information (with supposed "French speaking staff" not being able to speak French) on the matter and this airline did not proactively communicate on the fact that the luggage was definitely lost. The airline also provided a ridiculously low amount as indemnification (resulting in additional expenses for me for about 600 euros not covered by the indemnification).

### "still not take responsibility"
I recently booked an open-jaw ticket AMS-OVD/TLV-AMS for March 2019. When my Amex card was going to be charged, a notice appeared in Dutch (see attachment) that corporate cards would be charged with an additional amount of € 10,52. After the payment had been completed I contacted Transavia, because when I booked a flight earlier this year, the extra amount was refunded. Their response was now that they have changed the rules and that I will not be refunded. However, I responded that the message appearing on the screen while paying, clearly stated that it applied to corporate cards. I have a personal Amex Flying Blue card. Amex has also indicated that I don't have a corporate card. After engaging with Transavia about four times, they will still not take responsibility for the information that appears on their website when booking a ticket paying by credit card. Transavia, when are you going to do something that will give credibility with your customers?

### "They refuse to compensate"
Munich to Amsterdam. Flight delayed over 17 hours. They refuse to compensate. My flight number is HV5202, supposed to depart from Munich International Airport at 21:35, but was delayed by over 17 hours. I only got notification 2 hours after it suppose to fly. It was midnight, and the staff just sent us all with our luggage and nowhere to go. Around 1AM we got email about the flight will be on the next day at 13.00 (but in the end it boarded on 15.00). I have no choice but to book a hotel to stay overnight. I contact their customer service asking for compensation and my first try is denied saying the cause of delayed is not preventable. I read that The Court of Justice of the European Union has interpreted passenger rights strictly, so that there are virtually no exceptions for airlines to evade their obligations for breach of contract. It's my first time using Transavia and it's really disappointing specially the customer service part. The time that is wasted cant be brought back.

### "Horrendous experience!"
Geneva to Rotterdam. Horrendous experience! I had to cancel the ticket with 30 minutes after making a reservation, and there was no such option. I filled out a form, they got back to me a week later checking if I still want to cancel and offered to refund airport tax of 13 Euros. I had a complex itinerary and was able to cancel reservations with other airlines, but not Transavia. Never again!

### "I will not use them ever again"
Malaga to Paris Orly. Price was reasonable and it was easy to book online. The round trip flights Paris to Malaga we’re fine. The air crew was nice. Check in at Paris Orly was very confusing and disorganised. It was worse in Malaga, where we had to remind them to place tags properly on our bags, they were very sloppy and unfriendly. Sure enough, one of our bags was missing when we arrived in Paris Orly (14 July). We filed a report immediately and called everyday for updates. After 2-3 weeks they said my bag was found, but it’s never been sent to me. I’ve called and emailed 20x and they don’t know what to do. The Montreal Convention requires them to reimburse for loss after 21 days, so I filed a claim with receipts and everything (hours and hours to prepare). They haven’t paid, it’s been 90 days, and they still tell me my luggage was found and a supervisor would sort it out. Same story every two weeks, and I have to call them! I understand lost luggage, but not finding my luggage and not paying my claim? Worst experience in 30 years of flying. I will not use them ever again.

### "a wonderful experience"
Amsterdam to Fuerteventura. Superb experience. Great check-in, nice reminder and sufficient self service. Good service on-board. Taking price into account it was a wonderful experience!

### "it was a good flight"
Not Verified |  Marrakech to Amsterdam. We flew on Transavia from Amsterdam for our vacation in Morocco. The staff were kind and spoke good English, seats were quite nice for a low cost airline (also they’re green, so quirky!). We didn’t order food as these weren’t long flights. There’s no WiFi, seat power, or entertainment systems on the plane, but it was a good flight at a relatively cheap price.

### "Basic but comfortable"
Porto to Amsterdam. Basic but comfortable and efficient flight. Check in experience in Porto was efficient and friendly. They don't seem to have as many silly, hostile rules and fees as some of their other LCC competitors. The cabin service on this flight was good, and I particularly liked the fact that the captain seemed to give plenty of announcements. As a somewhat-nervous flyer, hearing from the captain is always calming and re-assuring. The captain even stood at the exit with the flight attendants at the end of the flight and farewelled passengers! No free service or entertainment but it's an LCC so it's expected. Purchase-able food menu seemed okay, though I didn't buy anything. Seat was comfortable enough for the length of the flight. Flight departed somewhat late but managed to make up some time and so we only ended up arriving only 15 minutes past schedule.

### "can not have high expectations"
Flew Pisa to Amsterdam with Transavia. Very simple airline, so you can not have high expectations. The ground service at PSA airport was really painful, slow boarding and boarded by foot. The seats are not very comfortable and the space for legs is really small, you need to pay (crazy expensive!) for food and beverages. However, usually this airline is quite cheap and overall is acceptable for short flight!

### "They play the silence mode"
Amsterdam to Malaga. Transavia lost my luggage.I did all the processes needed. They play the silence mode with customers, they don't answer emails, customer services send you to a website it doesn't exist.

### "I would not recommend it"
❌ Not Verified |  Thessaloniki to Amsterdam. This trip was absolutely frustrating. The flight was delayed for 2 hours, without receiving any notification from the company. We had to wait in front of the gate for 1 hour and a half and after passing the gate, we had to wait just outside of the gate, on the stairs, against the wind and the noise of an airport for certainly half an hour. My friend had a corresponding flight which he missed and all he was told was "Good luck". I had only booked hand-luggage and due to overbooking, I was forced to leave my bag as a cargo. Upon our arrival in Amsterdam, there was an extra 30 minutes of waiting for my bag, along with 2-3 other bags that were left behind for some reason. The services of Transavia are getting extremely low; I would not recommend it.

### "crew helpful and friendly"
Paris Orly to Dublin. Max fare so it did not cost me more to change to a flight a few days earlier (new flight had no fare difference). Some technical problem so boarding was delayed and flight took off about 40 minutes late but only a few minutes late arriving in Dublin. The passengers were well informed by the captain though. Overall the flight went OK and the crew helpful and friendly. However the behaviour of some passengers are unacceptable to me, I had to endure a good part of the flight with the person next to me who decided to take his shoes off and put his two feet up on the wall. I said nothing as I don't want to make a scene but perhaps airlines should have some rules regarding this. When I fly I am always respectful of other passengers but obviously not everyone thinks the same way.

### "uncomfortable flight experience"
Paris to Seville. Booked seats at the very front of the aircraft. We began boarding on time but got stuck for over 45 minutes in the hallway after they check your boarding pass and before you board the plane. It was very uncomfortable and hot in the hallway and tiring to stand for that long with all the carry on luggage and backpacks. There was no explanation for the delay. We finally boarded the plane at the time we were supposed to take off and the plane took off about 30 minutes late. The seats were small, my companion a 200lb male was cramped in his seat at the front of the plane. Overall an uncomfortable flight experience. The cost of the flight was also not worth it, easy jet would have been better.

### "Quick and efficient flight"
Flew Dublin to Paris Orly with Transavia. Quick and efficient flight. Take off was a few minutes late but arrived on time. The front seat (2F) was comfortable and with good leg room. On board service efficient and friendly. Food and drinks for purchase at reasonable prices. I opted for the pain au chocolat with coffee breakfast for 4 euros. Baggage was already waiting after clearing immigration (slight wait at immigration but it appears to have been handled much better than the last time I passed through Orly). Overall a good flight the only thing I was quite unhappy about was that the counter for bagage check in only opened two hours before scheduled departure yet airlines tend to advise us to arrive well in advance (I was at the airport about three hours before the flight was due to leave).

### "quite often there is a problem"
Amsterdam to Paris Orly. I have flown the Orly to Amsterdam route on Transavia a number of times, and generally it offers good value for money on a short flight. However, at least 1 out of 4 times there is a inexplicable delay and their logistics tend to be non-existent when this happens. For the morning Amsterdam to Orly flight on 8 March, flight was delayed at first for 30 minutes, so the gate was moved to a bus-out gate in the basement of Schiphol airport. Counter-intuitively, there was another flight leaving from the same gate at the same time. Of course it was absolute chaos, further delaying the flight. This also meant that there was not enough seating in the gate area, coincidentally the only bathroom was closed for cleaning, and there was no access to food or beverages except for a vending machine requiring coins. If you value your time and a basic level of comfort, I would avoid this airline if possible. It’s a fine airline when everything goes as planned, but extremely poorly managed when there is any type of problem, and quite often there is a problem.

### "Just a horrible airline"
Dublin to Orly. Just a horrible airline. Customer service does not exist - they simply don't care a tad about your well-being or how you perceive them. Flying from Dublin to Orly. Not only was the flight late, we also had to fly with a wet-lease company with an old plane from 1854. This is the 4th time I've flown with them - and the 4th time I'm having a bad experience.

### "just a terrible airline"
Alicante to Amsterdam. I have to say this is just a terrible airline. From the moment we arrived at the airport in Alicante to the moment we left the airport in Amsterdam everything went wrong. There was a 100 meter queue at the checkin desk with only one person working. We contacted transavia about this and they said they were unable to help us. Then the boarding took extremely long, the plane was fully booked and there was no space to fit bags in the overhead compartents. As a result, the crew asked people to check their bags as we entered the airplane. The whole process took very long. The seats were extremely small, much smaller than any economy i've flown with. Then to top it all off, it took at least an hour for our luggage to arrive at the baggage claim.

### Transavia customer review
I flew Transavia in November 2016 and I forgot to add my review. Better late than never! I knew it was a budget airline and I knew it was going to be a long flight. Dubai isn't exactly close to The Netherlands. I was very happily surprised. The staff were friendly, the plane left on time. We were told we may stop over to refuel halfway there but we didn't need to. We landed on time and without any issues. Yes you need to pay for your food and drink and yes the trolleys take a while to get to you if your at the back of the plane. But as long as you are prepared for the wait and maybe bring a bottle of water on board and a sandwich, packet of crisps, you will be more than fine! I am flying with them again in March 2018 and this time with my boyfriend. This time I'm bringing a shawl and a neck pillow and my laptop so we can watch a bit of TV while we fly because it can be boring without these things. The seats are comfy enough and the overall experience has left me feeling more than happy to fly them again. It was a safe flight (and I'm a terrified flyer by the way). I wont forget to review them again this time - so wait till the end of March and I will add my 2nd review.

### "incompetent, terrible company"
Madrid to Paris. If there is any trouble with your flight, you are left alone at the airport. Transavia has not representation (or so they said) and refused to help travellers or even talk to us. We had a flight from Madrid to Paris on the 14/12 at 15:00, which was announced 2 hours late. We quickly saw it was getting worst, but they then had us wait at the gate, not providing any information. There was no Transavia employees but only the ones from the own airport that would not say anything: "will we even fly? We don't know. We were there until 22:00 at night, they said there will be a flight and suddenly it got cancelled. From 13h30 to 22:00 in an airport for nothing. They told us we would have a flight the next day at 14:00. Already 24h lost on your trip, great. Next day, no flight at 14:00, again no information from Transavia, they did not care to come and talk to us. The flight left at 18:30 with a different company no one never heard about, there was no food or drinks inside the plane as it was not supposed to leave. Over 4 hours late on a flight that was scheduled the day before. They gave us a 3,5€ voucher for food that was not even working in Madrid! And refuse to compensate us for the second flight, which was 4 hours late on the scheduled hour. We basically arrived with 27 hours late on the original schedule, getting in Paris at 20:00 on a Friday instead of 17:00 on a Thursday. Yes they are cheap, but it also comes with these negative sides. I would rather spend a bit more money and not waste my whole holidays for an incompetent, terrible company. Will not recommend to fly with them to anyone.

### "ground staff is rude at best"
I can confirm the problems with the Paris Orly airport reported by fellow travellers. Ground staff is rude at best, and I recommend to avoid this route at all cost. In particular, I would like to remark their very inconsistent policy with regards to hand luggage; while other passengers (including my friends) could get into the plane without a problem with a purse and a correct suitcase, others were charged 40€ quite arbitrarly, for purses or laptop bags that have been allowed in the past without any further issue. This is not only abusive, but it is done without warning and for quite petty reasons. I've flown Transavia 20+ times, and never encountered this kind of problems thus I recomment to avoid departure from Paris Orly at all cost.

### "make Ryanair look like Qatar Airways"
Flight and staff from Dublin to Orly couldn't have gone better. Was going to write a nice review until I encountered the staff at Orly on return flight. Rude! Shouting at people! Questioning why I had 4 bags with me (for 4 people!) Complaining that the bags were oversized when they were well inside the designated dimensions. Didn't interact with flight crew on return but they seemed annoyed with everyone and every question / request. The airline was picked by a travel agent as part of a package trip. I'd never heard of them before and was apprehensive based on other reviews. I can hand on heart say they make Ryanair look like Qatar Airways.

### "Avoid Transavia at all costs"
Paris Orly to Tunis. I checked in online and avoided waiting forever, only to be be told at the gate that my cabin size luggage was too big to go on the plane by 0.5 cm. (It is a cabin size approved luggage, which has come with me on all kinds of different flights, wether it was Tunisair or Ryanair). The staff member was rude to everyone, for no apparent reason, and was yelling at us. People were complaining as most of them were traveling to go on vacation and didn’t need to be yelled at by a stranger. The plane left late, and my luggage would have easily been able to fit in the overhead compartment, but I had to wait at luggage claim instead. Avoid Transavia at all costs! They are horrible.

### "Paris Orly airport was unprofessional"
Paris to Prague. First of all they send you a lot of emails to check in “right in time” but than after checking in to your flight, theres no email confirmation or anything. The staff they have on Paris Orly airport was unprofesional. First they were shouting that its time to checking baggage. So we all did a qeue and put my cabin baggage (which Im always traveling with) and pointing a finger on it saying this is a problem. Than puts some paper on it and telling me in french to go on the end of line. When I was trying to ask what does the problem means, she told me in french again and when I asked if theres anybody speaking english, she just said no with a big smile. And the problem has also a lot of people from the plane. But nobody knew anything more. The thing was that they put all those problematic baggage down the plane and after arrival we had to wait for it as a checked baggage. Thats not a big deal but its the last thing you want. So please, Transavia, be international also in your staff language education.

### "still waiting for the payment"
I booked a ticket from Transavia to fly from Amsterdam to Paris in July 2016. They cancelled the flight and migrated me to another flight same day. Ten days later I got an email from Transavia states that they will make me 500 euros payment regarding to "As per the European regulation (CE) n°261/2004, we inform you that you will receive 250 euros to compensate you for the inconvenience caused in the organization of your trip. After that, I provided them neccessary information to get the payment. After some time my bank called me and told that because of missing surname information in the SWIFT transaction, they rejected the payment. I told the situation to Transavia and they told me that this is not correct, they made the payment. However; this is not true and I have official document from my bank and also sent this document to Transavia. It has been 14 months right now and I am still waiting for the payment.

### "crew was very friendly"
I'm not a frequent flyer, but I know much about airlines / airplanes. It was a late summer morning, and I arrived at Schiphol Airport. It was around 8AM in the morning. I checked my baggage in, it was a very fast check in. After the safety check, I had around 2 hours till the flight will depart, I went to the panoramic terrace, and after that to the gate. It was a 10 minute walk. When the boarding started, I was the first in the plane. The crew was very friendly from the beginning. We departed on time, and after a short taxi to the runway we took off to the sunny island of Malta. After half an hour into the flight, the cabin crew started with the first food and drink service. It is not free, but very cheap in relation to other airlines, After the food and drink service, I Started with my movie. Transavia has a app, and with that app you can watch 5 movies a each flight for free. The flight was really smooth, and the pilots gave a lot of information about the flight time and route. About an hour before landing, the crew came in with the second food and drink service. I had nothing but a drink, because I had a good lunch in the flight earlier. After the landing we parked at the gate (10 minutes early) and we had a friendly goodbye from the crew. We waited about 10 minutes in the arrival hall for our luggage, and when we had the bags we had a taxi to the hotel. When I took a look at the airport in the taxi, I saw our airplane in the beautiful Maltese sun.

### "happy with the services"
Innsbruck to Amsterdam. Very basic airline. Value for money is fantastic. Took round trip from Amsterdam to Innsbruck. They only fly once a week so had no other options for this route. Both trips were in time. Was happy with the services, check in counter was kind enough to allow an extra baggage for one of our companions.

### "very nice experience"
Tel Aviv to Amsterdam in the week before Christmas. The price of this flight was 150 euros (return flight). Boarding was delayed in our outbound flight by 20 minutes, but we landed in Amsterdam in time. The plane was relatively new, and the seats in it were decent (nice width and legdom). The cabin crew was very nice and made our flight nice. There is no in-flight entertainment, but it's not too bad because this was a short haul flight. The food available for purchase is reasonably priced, a large bag of M&Ms costs only 2.5 euros and a bottle of water costs 2 euros. Overall, we had a very nice experience with Transavia and we will love flying with them in the future.

### "comfortable for a short flight"
Paris Orly to Dublin. Booked using flying blue miles so even booking with extras only costs about 63 euros one way. Flight itself was generally OK but the cabin was very hot and it was only about half an hour after take off that it cooled down. Booked the front row seats for me and my friend and it was comfortable for a short flight. However on the ground service was not great. This was partly because the flight was out of Orly and between dropping off luggage, passing through security and immigration took about an hour and a half. Not the airline's fault but flying out of Orly would require plenty of time so need to plan ahead. On arrival in Dublin it took 45-50 minutes before luggage was delivered.

### "all in all, good flights"
I had a pleasant trip to and from Malaga with Transavia. Check in was simple. The flight itself was 3 hours, but with enough leg room I was comfortable. The seats were a pretty bilious shade of green, but were well cushioned. A bit of excitement in Malaga when we bounced off the runway and went round again. Amazing how quiet the passengers became after that! There was a long queue at check-in on the way home, but we left on time. All in all, good flights.

### "waited 1.5 hours in line"
Paris Orly to Malaga. Once I got on the plane, my experience with Transavia was solid. The planes are newer and flight attendants are very nice. However, my experience attempting to check a bag was an absolute nightmare. I paid for this service ahead of time, had my boarding pass already downloaded on my phone, so I simply needed to drop my bag. I waited 1.5 hours in line and when I got to the front I was finally able to get someone's attention. He told me I no longer had time to check my bag because the gate was closed. I'm sure others had a similar problem because the line was probably about 3 hours long when I left. I had 2 bottles of champagne in my bag that I simply had to leave on the ground and I ran to my gate (and still had about 30 min of waiting time when I got there). When I emailed the airline to request a refund and to tell them about my experience, they unapologetically refused to pay back my 19 euros. Said I should have gotten there 3 hours earlier to check a bag. I got my credit card company to go to bat for me and all is fine now.

### "Avoid at all cost"
Heraklion to Amsterdam. Transavia is the worst airline I have ever been on. I had a flight to Atlanta (with KLM) from Heraklion, through Amsterdam. Flight was booked through Delta airlines. The day of the flight, I arrive 2 hours early to the airport to check in, and after 15 minutes of waiting, the check in agent tells me that I do not exist in their system. I show her the paid for and confirmed flight, she looks again, and says I do not exist. Then, she asks her supervisor to check. This supervisor goes for 45 minutes and comes back saying that she can see my Amsterdam - Atlanta flight, but no flight on Transavia. The reason I was given for the mess was that the Delta "system" did not send the reservation to the KLM/Transavia "system" (as if that's something I should fix for them!). She then asks me to "call Delta", and expects me to resolve a problem that occurred between Transavia and Delta, without my own knowledge! After that, I had to ask her to find me a phone, since I could not use my own to call internationally. She takes me to their reservation desk, and the agents there start shouting at me as if it was my fault that I needed to make a call in their office; a call that they should've done (In fact, I was asked to find the Delta phone number myself!). At that point, my flight had already departed, and after reaching Delta myself (since the Transavia agents never called for me, instead they shouted at me to get out), and being rebooked on a flight the next day, I go to these agents to check whether they can see my reservation. Once again, they say that I don't exist in their system! After another long discussion with them, I was given someone on the phone from Transavia, who said that Delta did indeed book me, but Transavia decided to cancel my flight on their leg twice because of "payment". I tried to explain to her that this makes no sense, since my connecting flights are confirmed, I have a payment receipt, a confirmed ticket number from Delta, and everything is in order. She again repeats the same thing. After all this mess, I return to my newly booked hotel, contact Transavia by email. Then, as if it was magic, a few hours after, they send me an email saying that what happened was just a "mistake", and they give me my confirmation number. Overall, terrible airline, terrible staff, and terrible experience. Avoid at all cost.

### "put us at the last seat"
Amsterdam to Larnaca. I booked my flight from Toronto to Larnaca in November 2016 with KLM. I left Toronto Feb. 2017 arrived in Amsterdam Feb. 24 and took the connecting flig ht from Amsterdam with flight HV5313 for Larnaca that KLM arranged for me and my wife with Transavia. Although I booked the flight 4 months ahead and I was hoping to get a decent seat at the front of the economy section. They put us at the last seat where the seats do not move back. Although there were empty seats and I requested a change the flight attendant was fairly rude. I saw with my own eyes changing some other people. I will not fly an airline that I cannot go online and choose my own seat. Also people could not find a place to put their luggage.

### "seats are very small "
Barcelona to Munich. After I booked the flight, the schedule was changed (5 hours later!). So I booked a new flight. That was changed several times (about 30 - 45 minutes). I had to search in the Website of the Airport (Barcelona), which Terminal I have to go, Transavia did not inform me. 2 hours before the sceduled time it was again delayed by 50 minutes. It seems therefore not reasonable to fly with Transavia if you have to stick to your own timetable. I will not book a flight again. The seats are very small (looking around me, I saw that 50 % of the passengers could not lean their heads back) and there was no room for the feet. It was also not clean.

### "Boarding procedure was chaotic"
Flew Transavia from Amsterdam to Munich. Boarding procedure was chaotic and ground staff were unable to guide matters in an efficient way. A small purse does count as an item of hand luggage and had to be placed in the wheeled case, which makes it impossible to carry even the smallest personal items. Without any need, wheeled cases were not allowed on the aircraft even though the plane was not even half full. No recommendations.

### "canceled flight after 8 hours delay"
Zürich to Amsterdam. First, they canceled the flight after 8 hours delay. Then after very bad communication, they transferred me to a new flight next day with KLM. Here I had to pay again for my luggage, and this was even more expensive than I paid first at Transavia. Now Transavia doesn't want to pay the difference. So in total, the flight was 30 hours delayed. In the airport, I received a voucher of 10CHF. In Zurich airport, you can't survive for 10CHF. So I paid for a lot of food and drinks by myself.

### "I would fly with them again"
Nantes to Berlin. Friendly cabin crew and very polite. They offered me to sit on an emergency row because of my height. The food is not included as it is a low cost airline, but the prices are not too bad compared to other low cost airlines. Nice new aircraft, comfortable seats. Only downsides: they were a bit too insisting with how to sit the baby on our laps although he already had his seatbelt, and my wife had to breastfeed him to avoid pain to his ears. Also the ticket price was quite expensive for a low cost company and a short flight. I would fly with them again though.

### "Transavia did a good job"
Eindhoven to Stockholm. Again Transavia did a good job. Friendly crew and on time performance. We paid 330 euros for a return for 2, including 1 suitcase on hold and emergency exit seats, which certainly added to the comfort. With 46 euros however I think the luggage fee is too high. Reasonably priced food. Transavia uses Eindhoven Airport for many flights, which is small and efficient and much better than Schiphol.

### Transavia customer review
My flight was delayed for more than 4 hours last minute. Of course we could not contact them as they start to work 8am only. So I submitted complain mentioning to coontact me asap regarding the refund and that I am not going to take the flight as it is not possible. I had to rush the same minute to find another solution, to get another ticket for 300EUR as I had important plans in Paris already and could not miss it. Now, after almost a week of thinking, they reply me, I would get a compensation, but I refused to take the almost 5 hours delayed flight, so I cannot get any refund. Basically, the customer service in this company does not exist, they do not take any responsibility. It is not the cheapest airlines, although in the cheapest ones you are treated as a respected customer, staff is more polite and seats have more space. It was the worst experience. I have read many reviews now, and noticed their flights are always late/delayed. I had flight back with them on Sunday, and it was delayed another 30min. They do not even communicate this to the customers and staff is not even sorry about this or offering help, eventhough half of the passengers missed last trains from Amsterdam. I would never recommend to fly with this airline.

### "excellent experience, will fly again"
Transavia is a new operator on the Helsinki sector and we flew one-way from Amsterdam to Helsinki on 17th April. Very crowded check-in that was handled very efficiently, once we boarded in the Easter chaos, were happy to board a new Boeing 737-800 which was quiet and very pleasant. Excellent cabin crew - very friendly and smiling, but a relatively cramped seating. Excellent experience, will fly again.

### "the staff were friendly"
We flew with Transavia from Munich to Tel Aviv and return. All together there were nine of us with children. The service was good, the aircraft was clean, the staff were friendly and the departure was on time both ways. Overall we were very satisfied and will probably fly with them again.

### "Will never use again"
Paris Orly to Luton. I fly regularly with Transavia and there are always delays either in Luton or Orly. Also my last experience was horrible. No customer support on Whatsapp or social media - Staff have no clue about what is allowed or not. I have travelled over 10 times with a luggage and find out on my last trip that it was too big to carry on the aircraft, therefore me and my pregnant wife had to carry laptops on our way back. We finally found out that we should have been allowed! The flight was late again I wrote a long complaint and got a reply basically saying "Thanks for contacting us, it will help us to improve. Sorry about your bad experience!  Will never use again.

### "No customer support "
Rotterdam to Faro. Had to change my flight due to sudden health issue. Call the customer service of Transavia: spoke with a guy who split my boyfriend and my ticket without me asking for that. Everyone sounded so incompetent at customer service: was given incorrect information on my booking and ended up paying twice as much for my ticket. Don't fly with Transavia - if you have to make a simple change with your tickets, you'll regret it! Myself, last time with them. No customer support at all.

### "it was organized badly"
Prague to Eindhoven. Because of fog the day before, the plane was rerouted to Schiphol and departed the next day also from Schiphol and passengers had to be transferred from Eindhoven to Schiphol. It would be a delay of 1 hour and 15 minutes if organized well. But it was organized badly and although foreseeable costed us the passengers waiting in Prague to toreturn to Eindhoven more the 3 hours dellay. Sure ground service denied to hand out vouchers what made me complain at Transavia in Holland before departure.

### "flight was cancelled"
Paris to Valencia. I used Transavia 2 times. First time was just recently from Wien to Paris, which was quite good and normal. Second time I was suppose to fly from Paris to Valencia. I came to airport and I just saw the information that flight was cancelled. What? I got no email no message. There were no staff from the company on the airport, so nobody to help. On the phone almost nobody speaking english, only french. Even after few minutes of waiting on the phone english speaker did not tell me any important information or how should I proceed. As the next flight is in next week, I cannot wait and I bought ticket via another company on next day, which is little bit expensive. Now I have right to get money back and also much more according to the law, so I am curious what the process of refund will be. Probably very difficult.

### "prepare for the worst service"
Dubai to Amsterdam. If you book with Transavia, prepare yourself for the worst service. When you ask the staff to order a drink, you get the answer 'We'll be passing by with our food and drink service soon'. Read 50 minutes later. They don't tell you in advance when they have to wait 2 hours in a plane for a stopover as they couldn't land in the Netherlands because of a storm, although they had this information before taking off. While the total trip was already 9 hours, and including the delay 11 hours, the only compensation was a cup of tea or coffee. On my way back I took Qatar Airways for also a very reasonable price. Difference in service was huge: very convenient seats, able to charge your mobile during the flight, view movies, smiling staff.

### "did not fit into that seat"
Munich to Tel Aviv. Many friends would expect me to start my review with the words: You get what you pay for. I'd love to but indeed Transavia does not even give you what you paid or would pay for. Instead they cancel flights on short notice changing your holiday plans (two more days in Israel), change planes, but do not update the prepaid extra leg room seats (no, they just become standard seats: your problem), - are not even able to sell hot drinks on board or have water in the toilets, because obviously somebody forgot to have fresh water loaded onto the plane prior to departure. The flight "experience" was still funny though. Cabin crew telling me I cannot use the (completely empty) first row, because these seats would have cost 5€ more than the exit seat I booked but didn't get. Perhaps they were too busy handing out free bottles of water to passengers visiting the lavatories. I have no clue where Transavia ordered the seats, but they were definitely not built for the average European person. I'm not too tall at 1,87m, but still did not fit into that seat. Neither did my seat neighbor from Israel. Although he was a nice person I'd rather not have been in contact with his leg for the whole duration (4 hrs) of the flight. Additionally you are forced to put your carry on luggage under the seat in front of you, which takes away the last chance to move your feet anywhere. Just have a look at the picture attached. I would recommend Transavia to children and people below 1,60m, who also have absolutely no expectations (hot drinks, toilets, etc.) of a flight.

### "waiting was really uncomfortable"
Eindhoven to Munich. Our Transavia flight was two hours delayed. We recognized about that on the time of actual departure. The staff on the info point wasn't polite. Nobody was willing to help us further or tell us something on the time of departure. The waiting on the airport was really uncomfortable and this could have been avoided by earlier communication.

### "seats are not comfortable"
Paris Orly to Oslo with Transavia. The aircraft was showing its age, not very clean, seats are not comfortable either. Departure and arrival were on time so quite punctual in timing. Crew members were smiling and doing the necessary. Food and drinks must be purchased, there is no free food or drink, few passengers were unaware of this and got into a little discussion with the crew.

### "for price it was a great flight"
Barcelona to Rotterdam. I got a ticket to Rotterdam for 80 euros, when most airlines had the same ticket for 180 euros so that is very good in itself. There were no delays, no problems at check in (I had only a carry on). They were strict about each passenger having only one bag, but I did not see them measuring too many suitcases to see if they fit the standard. I am almost sure I could recline the seats, which is great for a low cost, and the leg space was perfect (I am 180cm tall). Its a low cost, so dont expect super high quality, but for the price it was a great flight.

### "messed up the seats"
Paris Orly to Lisbon with Transavia. This low cost flight is not worth it. One hour delay, we couldn't take our hand bags in the cabin. They also messed up the seats, so I could not travel with my friends. The cabin crew are unpolite, and get mad at passengers that are complaining about their bad service.

### "don't take the risk"
Don't take the risk of flying with Transavia. They cancelled my flight from Amsterdam to Paris Orly 12 hours before take-off. They said that they would refund my ticket. Several emails went unanswered, information which they requested was sent three different times, more emails went unanswered. Contacted them via their Facbook page and tried again two more times to resolve the issue. Four months later, still no refund. I had to use a third party to get my money back. Transavia is hands down the worst customer service I have ever encountered in the airline industry. I'd rate a zero, but the website doesn't allow it.

### "Won't choose them again"
Booked Transavia for the first time from Amsterdam to Barcelona. Choose the Max Fare because according to them have a luggage allowance and you can choose your seat. The flight was delayed 1hr, the aircraft was old and uncomfortable. On arrival to Barcelona, after waiting for my bag never came through the belt. Had to go to the lost bag counter to complain. Been told that they will inform me in few hours. When the bag was finally found later in the same day I had to pay a taxi to go back to the airport because the airline won't deliver the bag in that day and I was leaving to a business trip outside Barcelona in the next morning. Dint know why they have a premium fare if you go get anything out of it. Plus the bags don't even arrive on the same flight! Won't choose them again!

### "no available information or staff"
Arrived to Dublin Airport, no information on my 0740 flight displaying - I contacted a Dublin airport staff member via the complimentary phone. I requested to speak to a Transavia member of staff; I was told they are not accepting calls. However, she was very helpful in providing me with information; Transavia flight was delayed by one hour but they didn't want to display a delay so just displayed a new time with a different flight number. She also informed me the flight would be delayed by two hours and this would be explained at the gate. My issues with the company are numerous :  incorrect information - no available information or staff - the carrier was switched to another provider. And so on.

### "not what we paid for"
Paris Orly to Sevilla. Reservation made on Transavia for a family of 5 pax. Flight TO3106 on 26 Oct. On departure date, aircraft changed to a 25 years old Airbus A320 instead of more modern Transavia Boeing 738. In addition, flight operated by a small charter airline called Smart Lynx. Not what we paid for and not the same level of service. Pitiful.

### "don't book on this airline"
Paris Orly to Barcelona. Stuck here at the airport instead of being in Barcelona - the flight is delayed for 5 hours! No one informed us before with the delay, we didn't receive a message nor a email notifying us with the delay and their website is not updated by the delay. Do yourself a favor and don't book on this airline.

### "punctual, friendly service"
Amsterdam to Paris Orly. A job well done by Transavia. Punctual, friendly service, reasonable prices on board and half the cost of the Thalys (booked only a few weeks in advance). Not faster than Thalys however, taken into account that they fly to Orly, which had slow connections with the centre of Paris.

### "acceptable seat for the duration"
Eindhoven to Barcelona. smooth boarding with self boarding pass. Clean airplane, 30 min delay. The usual trolley with drinks and snacks/ food, a good offer for the short flight. Quick service from the staff, good language skills. Toilet was clean, acceptable seat for the duration of the flight.

### "bad customer service"
I will make sure not to fly again with Transavia, departing from Lisbon a few days ago the ground personnel was nice and helpful but leaving Orly the ground staff was awful. I arrived really early at the gate (50 minutes prior boarding) I was directly asked to check my bag as the flight was full. I was told my bag was too big and it had to be checked. It was exactly the same bag that I used 4 days earlier. The women at the gate was rude and told me if I didn't like I should fly with a different airline. I will do it for sure. As I board the plane first, I was able to see many people entering the plane near the end of boarding were allowed to take their bag on board. When I did ask why these people were allowed to take bags that were bigger than mine they said "it's too late to check them". The moral of that arrive late you will treated better. Bad customer service and rude ground agents.

### "no help at all"
Munich to Copenhagen with Transavia. Not 1 single employee at the airport, we were given 3 short messages over the phone - the flight is canceled and there will be no hotel accommodations for the passengers. Passengers can contact Transavia through the website! I was standing in Munich with 2 children aged 3 and 5 years, and no alternative. No help at all. I will never consider flying with the company again. We got home 2 days later, and not with the above company.

### "staff are friendly"
Barcelona to Paris ORY with Transavia. The flight was super and on time. I had my bag 28KG and they let it in without a problem (paid for 25KG online). The seat selection was great, staff are friendly and the plane was clean. Selection of food and beverage was reasonable.

### "very good Dutch low cost"
Eindhoven to Munich/Innsbruck. Cheapest option between the Netherlands and Southern Germany/Austria. Late outbound flight was delayed which is rather common these days for low cost airlines because planes are heavily used during the day. Nice crew, bad legroom and reasonable priced food. Inbound flight from Innsbruck was on time. Transavia is a very good Dutch low cost alternative and the fly from local airport as Eindhoven and Rotterdam which are much more convenient than Schiphol.

### "I can recommend Transavia"
Munich to Porto and Faro to Munich on Transavia and impressed. Brand new B737-800 with sky interior. Both flights on time, cabin crew was nice and attentive. They are a low cost airline which means you have to pay for every extra like baggage and food on board. But they provided what I wanted - a cheap, safe and on time flight. So I can recommend Transavia! Only annoying thing was the long check-in line and the long waiting time at Munich airport. But due to the big amount of flights on this friday early morning the queues are no fault of the airline but of Munich airport.

### "just not good enough"
I wil be reluctant to fly with Transavia again. Today 8th July 2016 I was flying from Paris Orly to Dublin. The flight was delayed by almost an hour and a half. The problem we were informed was because of an engine fault. I understand that there can be an engine fault but what I cannot understand is why we had to sit in 30 degree of heat for so long. Surely if there was a fault the engineering staff preparing the aircraft for flight should have spotted the problem in the first instance. There was very little information given to the passengers during this time. All we saw was engineers going to and fro through the captains cabin. The pilots also at one stage left the aircraft leaving the passengers both bewildered and confused. Then just to add salt to the wound I had to pay for a cup of coffee. This happened, I might also add, on a very early morning flight when most or all of the passengers would not have had breakfast. Just not good enough.

### "never flying this airline again"
Paris to Munich. Horrible airline. They emailed us to tell us our flight had been cancelled 12 hours before a 6am flight. They didn't even rebook it for us, which is a pretty standard service, and instead made us call. However, being from the US and in Europe, we don't have cell service. When we finally borrowed a phone to call, they put us on hold for 20 minutes before hanging up and we had to redial. I am never flying this airline again, and I highly discourage anyone from doing so.

### "cabin crew excellent"
Pleasantly surprised by Transavia. Good information during delayed boarding, not so much of a problem really. Excellent seats, exit row for myself and family. Good safety demo, very comfortable seats, good priced meals and drinks, two servings on this flight from Amsterdam to Faro. Cabin crew excellent, good humour and professional. Capt and FO kept all informed and made up some time from earlier delay. Would recommend to friends, will be flying again (Will have to as I need to get home from Faro). No wifi or film on board, but hey, its only a short intra-Euro flight, nice to just sit and talk with my family.

### "improve service on the ground"
Prague to Eindhoven in late May 2016. Check-in for the flight left much to be desired - what is the point of having online check-in and no dedicated bag drop counter? Had to queue for nearly 40 minutes in a regular queue to be serviced by an extremely slow check-in agent who didn't know anything about visa requirements. Flight was uneventful and service was ok, two rounds by the cabin attendants for food and drink sales. Arrival into Eindhoven was ahead of schedule, though I had to wait for quite a bit of time for the bags to arrive on the belt. All in all I'd be more than happy to fly Transavia again, hopefully they can improve their service on the ground.

### "exit rows that were empty"
Porto to Funchal return with Transavia. Both flights were nice. In the flight to Funchal (because I'm 1.92m) the crew allowed me to sit in the emergency exit rows that were empty. OPO-FNC flight with small delay (15 min) due to late arrival. FNC-OPO on time.

### "first experience and last"
I was supposed to travel to Paris from Munich for an important meeting - the day before I received an email to tell me that the travel was cancelled. I tried to contact the customer service through various methods to postpone my flight and unfortunatly no response. This is my first experience with Transavia and it will be the last one.

### "no organisation at all"
Luton to Paris Orly with Transavia. The worst experience I've had. Staff are useless and no organisation at all. Over two hours late with little reason why. Seems as though they have not got a clue what they're doing. Counting passengers 6 times.

### "Pleasant cabin crew"
Paris Orly to Budapest. My personal experience with flying with Transavia was very good. Pleasant cabin crew, food really wasn't that bad. And seats were comfortable with decent leg room. Transavia uses Boeing 737-800 aircraft which have a pleasent and comfortable interior.

### "legroom made me go crazy"
The 737-800 on the 3 hour flight from Marrakech to Paris Orly was old, but it’s the legroom that made me go crazy. In row 2 there was even less space for my long legs than on a recent Ryanair flight. I understand the low-cost model, but I’m also willing to pay more for legroom, but what when it’s not offered on Transavia. And how come there is no option for priority boarding? Give me options. Actually, once I was on the plane, I realized I should have booked the bulk seat, which I usually don’t like for you can’t stretch out your legs. But on this flight, that would have been a better option than row 2. Thankfully, I thought the food menu was good. Great options. Healthy options. Although pricy for what they were. EUR 2.50 for water?

### "will avoid flying Transavia"
I flew from Innsbruck to Amsterdam with Transavia and it was my worst flight ever. During check-in they tagged by backpack as "not guaranteed on board" and I didn't really mind it being taken to the hold as it was quite big. The plane was only half full though so they let me board with the backpack. The staff was very annoyed that I brought it on board, even though they previously let me through without additional charges and most of the lockers were empty. During the boarding I wanted to ask the staff member to help me find a locker for my hand luggage, she was four rows away from me but couldn't be bothered coming to me, I had to almost scream to her about it! Later she didn't help me with putting the bag inside the locker, though even Ryanair and Wizzair staff help people with their luggage! Next to me was a group of 10 young guys who were really noisy during the whole flight (screaming and shaking my seat!). The passengers were annoyed asked them to be quiet but no one from the staff reacted. While staff was serving drinks (you have to pay 3 euros for tea in Transavia btw) I first said I'm not taking anything, but 20 seconds later changed my mind - the lady was incredibly annoyed by that, said it wasn't my turn to order now ? Definitely will avoid flying Transavia in the future, they have to teach their staff to be nicer.

### "treat passengers differently"
Paris Orly to Lisbon with Transavia. This airline treat passengers differently - some passengers were allowed to carry luggage in the cabin while others like me (with only a small bag) they did not allow. And even they did not allow to put my coat because they need to have room for the luggage from the other passengers! I protested and the crew said that with Easyjet would be worse - but I was not flying with Easyjet! Then they said that someone from the crew would talk with me, but no one showed during the flight!

### "just suck in every way"
Total mess of an airline This is the 3rd time flying with Transavia and it will be the last. To begin, every single time I fly with them, they make such a stink, bothering every single person about their baggage. Instead of asking if anyone would like to check their carry-on baggage for free before boarding, knowing that they don't have enough space in the plane (and they know, because it's been a problem every single time I've flied with them), they always tell people to rearrange their baggage so that it fits their requirements during boarding, holding up the line and wasting everyones time. This last trip, our flight was delayed by an hour, and instead of using this time efficiently, to ensure quick and stress-free boarding, the staff did nothing until everyone was in line, when a gruff, rude man immediately tagged my bag as being "not guaranteed to fit in the plane's carry-on compartments. My bag weighed 6kg, if not less, and fit exactly their requirements for the smaller carry-on that is granted to every passenger. When we started boarding, the staff was coldly telling every other person in line that they had to put their shopping bags/tiny purses etc. inside their main baggage or their couldn't enter the plane. Everyone is stressed, people are held up waiting in line for everyone to conform to this airline's illogical and stupid rules, and we get delayed another half hour in addition to the lateness of the plane. Not one staff member apologized for the delay except the pilot right before take off, and the same man who tagged my bag earlier seemed to revel in the fact that I had to check it. In addition, the lack of logic to these ridiculous regulations astounds me. Before entering the plane, the staff proclaimed that there was no room on the plane for more baggage, but upon entering, we notice there would be plenty of room for baggage if people were just told to keep their coats under their seats. One more thing is that this is an airline that likes to blame its client. On my flight from Paris to Barcelona, they decided that it was the fault of the people on the plane who "didn't respect their baggage policy" that this was why we were later than normal. And they made this very clear to us. But the real problem was that they forgot to check our IDs at the gate while boarding because they were so distracted harassing people about their bags that they forgot. They forgot to check IDs! Because of bags! Then they had to make everyone get out their baggage from the compartments to check them inside the aircraft. Beyond disorganized - if it wasn't so aggravating it might actually be so ridiculous it's amusing. Like I could almost write a comedy sketch about this. But no. If Transavia could just learn a little logic and basic customer service, maybe they could be an OK low-cost airline. But going by their record so far, they just suck in every way.

### "no apologies, nothing"
In my 27 years of flying, this flight with Transavia was the worst experience I've had, which is saying a lot because I fly with multiple budget airlines. I had already checked in online, but I had to check in again at the counter at the airport. Upon checking in, the gruff clerk weighed my bag and said that I needed to check it in. I had carefully packed the bag in accordance with the carry on rules, which is below 10kg. She stated that the limit was 8kg, which it is not, and I had checked multiple times to ensure this. She begrudgingly let us take it with us, saying it was not guaranteed that it could be carried onto the flight. We were then notified that boarding was delayed. No reasons, no explanation, nothing. We would be updated hourly. 2 hours after the scheduled take off time they finally had us line up for a measly drink voucher. Most of us had been here from early morning and it was nearing noon. Finally, after a delay of about 4 hours, hence wasting our precious time in Paris, we starting boarding. While I am a resident of the States, I am a South Korean National. There were two clerks checking our tickets and passport before going in. My sister, who has the same status as I, was checked by a female clerk, and was let into the plane without a hitch. Then I was check by a male clerk, and he asked if I had a Schengen visa. South Korean Nationals do not require a visa. Then he stated that France has lifted this visa, and was requiring people to have a visa for France specifically. This was merely a rumor and France had not done such a thing. This poorly informed clerk then rudely said that I need a visa when I clearly did not, and upon me showing proof online of such info, he leered at me and told me to step aside as he let everyone else in. After everyone else was let in, he then frantically made calls and checked online himself. As he was reading he realized how he had understood this falsely, and then without even making an eye-contact with me, told me and my sister that we could get onto the flight. No apologies, nothing.

### "page is not user friendly"
I chose Transavia because it was my only option. The page is not user friendly. I could not figure out how to check in online. The booking I received was in another language. I came 5 min too late to for last check in at the airport due to traffic problems and my confusion of which part of the airport it was - which is my own fault. I did not have any luggage that had to be checked in which made me too optimistic about time needed. When I asked the staff if there is anything to do about that they send me back and forth between different stations of their airline in the flight which made me feel stupid. It would have been nice if they straight away could tell me that it was too late. The lady in information booth was absent for 25 min and empty information booth is unprofessional. Disregard the review of the flight itself it just had to be filled in.

### "good low-cost airline"
TYransavia is a good low-cost airline with outstanding service. I fly at least 4 times a year with Transavia and it has always been a good experience. As I am a tall person, 198cm, it usually is quite hard for me to squeeze in to a economy seat. This is the same with Transavia, but every time I fly with them they try to give me better seats (for free), sometimes even premium if available, or they find a row with an empty seat. Their website as well as online service (email) are amongst the best I've experienced with any airline.

### "acceptably-priced inflight menu"
Flown this route several times over the last few months, booking six weeks in advance and paying around EUR120 return. Online checkin with PDF boarding pass works well (although mobile boarding pass was not always available). Security at RTM is a breeze, pleasant little airport, quick boarding by foot across the apron to aircraft, on-time/early departures and arrivals in all cases, seats a bit tight with no headrest, but a friendly cabin crew and an acceptably-priced inflight menu. All in all I'm a satisfied customer and would recommend.

### "recommend for short flights"
Not very nice on the ground, but cheap, on time and with nice staff. Seats ok. I recommend this airline for short flights.

### "the worst in 20 years of flying"
No compensation given for misleading statements. I was in Malta and experienced decompression sickness due to diving – 24h after, my airline refused entry to my flight for medical reasons, and said to book a flight with extra oxygen on board. With all flights booked and my airline needing one week to provide oxygen, I call Transavia to book any flight to Europe that can guarantee a bottle of oxygen (I should have been at work already at this time so I decide to try and travel through a connection city back to London). The staff answers that the flight HV5774 from Malta to Amsterdam, 24 hours later, can be booked with a bottle of oxygen guaranteed - I only buy my ticket with them on the basis of the availability of this bottle, otherwise I would choose a different airline, as it is about my medical safety. The booking confirmation says: "Transavia.com will provide extra oxygen on board". When I check-in, I ask the employee at the counter if the oxygen is available for me. She makes a call and confirms that the oxygen is available. But once in the plane, a person from Transavia comes and says "I'm sorry madam but we have no oxygen onboard - are you really going to need it? I had to make a call at my own risk and realised that Transavia had falsely stated the availability of oxygen – and not just one time! – and ignored my medical requirements. Desperate to get home as I already had 500€ of extra flight costs, weighting pros and cons, I decide to test my luck and stay on the flight. The person next to me – who happens to be a nurse – found the whole situation unacceptable, and proposed to check out on me regularly during the flight. Then I asked for a small bottle of water to help in case I’m not feeling well. The employees refused to give me the bottle and insisted on me paying 2,70€ if I wanted it. Finally, the flight arrived with 30min delay, causing me to be unable to pick-up my luggage at the arrival as I would otherwise miss my next flight to London. I had to leave it behind and fill-in a form at the "lost and found" in London. (my luggage was “lost” for 5 days). I contacted Transavia to complain. They started by telling me it was my fault because I made my request with “too short a notice” and they need 72 hours. The employee answered then “we cannot give you a refund” and proposed a gift voucher. But I needed to first buy a ticket and then they would refund it (even though they just said that for my complaint no refund is possible – and anyway, who would trust a company that says “we will refund” when they just said “we have extra oxygen” and it was a lie?). Running out of patience I decide to accept the deal. The final joke was when I actually tried to buy a flight: I realised Transavia does not fly from London, so I will never be able to use what I was given! This experience was the worst I had in 20 years of flying and Transavia can be sure they will never see me ever again.

### "cabin crew did a good job"
Dublin to Paris with Transavia recently. It was quite cheap as it was very last minute and with the departure time of 19.55 it allowed me to get a full days work done before I went. However, I checked in online only to find that when it came to boarding that the system in the airport had not been updated as such and that those of us (the majority it has to be said) who thought we had checked in were not and so had to be manually checked in which took almost an hour. This isn't really the fault of the airline, they blamed the airport, but there was too much confusion in the run up to the point where they opened the flight. The ground staff could see there was an issue and should have opened boarding earlier. The result of which was those with boarding cards issued in the airport got on the plane and were sitting on it for over an hour before the doors closed. Moreover when we eventually took off over an hour late we landed in Orly as the busses were leaving for Paris. No trains, no nothing which meant hanging about waiting to get into the as a result of this it was nearly one am before I got tomy hotel. The flight itself was fine, it's pretty cramped in that spotless cabin with the Boeing Sky Interior, thankfully it was a short flight! The menu range was ok but a little limited looking. The cabin crew did a good job considering they looked like they were out of patience waiting to go, and handled a fairly drunk passenger who managed to smuggle two bottles of Guinness onboard with aplomb.

### "will avoid to fly Transavia again"
I was flying a few days ago from Athens to Amsterdam with Transavia. No problem with the flight, on time, staff ok but not as friendly as expected. But before departure I received the usual email to check in, which I did (of course I had to pay 4 euros more to change my seat) - and when I received my confirmation I realized that this was for my return flight. (I have no idea how they managed to do this, it's supposed that I couldn't check in for my return flight yet, only 24 hours before). So I had to do it all over again. Anyway, yesterday I was flying back from Amsterdam. Once aboard I realized that this was not a Transavia airplane. The staff told me that the flight would be operated by Corendon. Has anyone heard of them before? Well, I hadn't. For me it's important to know a few things about an airline before I fly, concerning the safety in the first place of course. I was so frustrated. They could at least use a KLM airplane which would be acceptable since it's basically the same company. But they can't make passengers fly with an unknown airline. I'm very dissapointed and will avoid to fly with Transavia again. To be fair though I have to say that Corendon Airlines flight was very good, the staff super friendly and polite and it was my first time to fly with a woman pilot

### "friendly staff"
Flew Transavia from Rotterdam-The Hague to Girona,. Friendly staff, on time departure and early arrival. Clean cabin and inflight entertainment app is handy and convenient.

### Transavia customer review
It was a good flight, no problems whatsoever. The cabin crew were very friendly, if you had a problem they came in a second. The seats where comfortable in my opinion. Food could be better though, but I would recommend this airline.

### Transavia customer review
Rotterdam to Palma and paid for a seat with extra legroom (Emergency Exit). Good flight, on time, good seats. On return leg paid for extra legroom in row, 1 but these were not worth the money – not much legroom and narrower seats due to the tables being folded into the armrests. Overall a good recommendation. Rotterdam a brilliant airport.

### Transavia customer review
Very nice flight with from Orly to Dublin. Orly was very convenient to use and Transavia were not strict on hand luggage allowance and staff were very friendly. Flight departed about 40 minutes late with a flight time of 1 hour and 25 minutes. I would recommend Transavia and their fares from Paris are very competitive at 35 euros each way.

### Transavia customer review
Transavia's baggage-checking equipment broke and delayed many from checking into their flights. When finally fixed my group were given 2 options: leave luggage in Paris or don't get on the flight. No offer to see the luggage through to the next destination and no concern for this group's (primarily elderly) ability to reach their next destination. They could not leave their luggage and were stranded in a foreign country's airport. $1,000+ later flights have been purchased but not before this company declares they are free from blame even though it was their equipment that delayed over 100 people. Will never use them again.

### Transavia customer review
Transavia does the job but there is no fun, pleasure or convenience. Extremely early departure from Schiphol (before 6am) and extremely late and delayed return from Faro (around 10 pm: with no explanation or apologies). Crew just ok, seating cramped (is that plastic they have covered the seats in? terrible), cabin hot and stuffy with tons of screaming kids. Transavia is obviously very concerned about luggage and changes its policies on that regularly. The latest is that it will accept certain size of bags on board but others may or may not make it depending on the actual situation. Those bags may be taken in at the gate and transported in the hold at no extra cost. This is especially frustrating as luggage handling at Schiphol is terrible. Common practice there is to offload a few suitcases to be able to (I guess)  report on time 'bag delivery' then wait for over 45 minutes to get the rest of the bags out. I am also so annoyed by the self promotion of Transavia in their inflight magazine: they cant stop talking about how they have spent a fortune on restyling logos, livery and uniforms but passenger comfort is not mentioned. If you are low cost, we hate to see you invest money but not on things that are important to us. Final issue: Transavia finally joined the 'earning miles' scheme of KLM but despite code sharing with KLM on most flights it has its own rules that are totally not transparent. You can earn miles but only on fare types that no one has ever heard off (Transavia does not offer a choice of fares) and segments don't count: it's basically useless.

### Transavia customer review
We were delayed for 2 and a half hours on a Barcelona to Amsterdam flight. This delay incurred unforeseen additional costs in the airport departures area. Buying food and drink is expensive when the kids say they are hungry. Onboard the "operational excuse" apology for the delay was brief (technical problems). Then the cabin crew quickly got on with the more important business of selling expensive drinks and food to tired and delayed passengers. The 3 hr rule means that compensation is not possible in this case. I will contact Transavia to determine why a courtesy goodwill drink is not offered to passengers in these circumstances.

### Transavia customer review
Lisbon-Eindhoven. Computer problems in Lisbon caused quite a long cue at baggage drop but no delay in the end. It would be nice if Transavia tells passengers on their boarding passes that they have to go to the - badly sign- posted - terminal 2 in Lisbon. It turned out we had to take a bus. Crew on board friendly and efficient. Paid 15 euros for seats 2E and F with more leg space. Still limited because of pantry wall. Emergency-exit seat offers more leg room. Transavia doesn't have an iPhone app for storing boarding pass in pass book which is rather old fashioned these days.

### Transavia customer review
90mn delay for the flight BCN Paris Orly. Chaotic boarding very noisy passengers crew did not really care. Old B737-800 dirty. Not even a glass of water to apologise. Never again.

### Transavia customer review
Flew Amsterdam to Pisa. Small delay outbound due to changing a tyre on aircraft which was actually a KLM 737 which was nice. Overall a good flight friendly staff good service. On return flight was offered seat with more legroom with no extra cost. Loved the modern funky green cabin interior. Again good flight friendly service and even IFE which is a 1st for me on a low cost airline many national airlines don't even have that in short haul. By far the best low cost airline I have flown with and I have been on a number of them in Europe.

### Transavia customer review
All time low airline experience. Going through Delta and KLM we somehow ended up on a low-budget carrier from Amsterdam to Marrakech. The material on the plane said Transavia -—never heard of it until I pulled the card out of the seat pocket after the flight attendant defended the lousy customer service by offering the description “ low-budget”airline. I didn't realize that I had reached the airline hinterlands when I booked through Delta. (The first leg of the trip was KLM which I would fly any time). When we boarded the plane it was freezing cold so I walked down the aisle in search of a blanket. Found some. Was told by the flight attendant that I could not have one they weren't officially offered on this flight. That was a first. Then the drink cart rolled down the aisle. We asked for water and a cup of hot water. Then they waited for payment. My husband handed back his bottle of water and I was informed that my waxed paper cup of hot water would be 2 Euros. In the most condescending voice imaginable he explained that the purchase prices were listed in the seat pocket. I said it didn't cross my mind that there would be a price for water and I handed it back. The flight attendant said he was quite sure that low- cost airlines in the US charged for everything. End of discussion but never in my airline experience have I paid for water (or any other soft drink). Just saying pay attention to the co-carriers and know what you are getting into. If I had known I would simply have bought snacks and drinks in the terminal. Schipol Airport has fabulous markets and shops I could have been well-supplied for the flight if I had known to be prepared.

### Transavia customer review
AMS-GRO. Gerona return on descent flying times. Both in/outbound flights were delayed 1h to 1h30. Staff on board were friendly but BOB product is expensive prices at GRO airport were 30% less. Both flights were on a B738 both hired outbound GOL inbound Kulula South African with overhead entertainment and better seat pitch. A good choice to fly direct to Costa Brava. Gerona airport is a nice convenient airport. Upon arrival during heavy rainfall we where transported to the terminal by bus while next door Ryanair passengers had to walk. Transavia obviously being a good LCC.

### Transavia customer review
Madeira to Porto and return - their product seems consistent without odd boarding procedures for hand luggage or hidden fees which often happens in other major European low cost airlines. Everything is very clear and simple with flight attendants being professional planes clean and no major delays.

One leg of a Houston-Casablanca trip was operated by Transavia (Casablanca-Amsterdam) although it was booked under a KLM number. Unable to pre register for flight. No refreshment at all served on 3.5 hr. flight not even soft drinks. Any refreshment had to be paid for.

### Transavia customer review
The flight from Malta to Orly and back was as good as any other service but the ground handling staff at Orly airport at the check in were atrocious. Passengers had the hold and hand luggage allowance clearly printed on the ticket but this information was not in the check in computers. The staff chose to believe the computer and not the customer with the ticket. Some people took over an hour to be processed. Most of the staff showed no manners in dealing with such a problem and one member just closed and walked away. In the end all passengers won the day but Transavia lost a lot of goodwill.

Flew from Malaga to Rotterdam on 28th May. Flight was delayed due to a birdstrike (unavoidable) There was however no replacement plane in Spain so one was sent from Amsterdam. The delay meant that Rotterdam would no longer be open on our arrival and we would have to fly to Amsterdam instead. A bus was provided to take people to Rotterdam. After receiving 15 euros for food there was no crew around to provide help to passengers who needed to change/arrange pick ups at Rotterdam or if there were other issues. There was no free internet to contact people electronically. Furthermore the plane became later and later without explanation. Once the plane arrived at 2am (6.5 hours late) there was no offer of food or drink on the plane (not even water). The staff were generally rude and unhelpful (with one woman just walking off when people tried to ask her questions). I understand the delay was avoidable but the customer care really was appalling.

### Transavia customer review
Booked months ahead for Amsterdam-Casablanca mostly due to the favourable price. Easy check-in and staff both there and at the gate rigorously enforced the cabin baggage limits. Minimal legroom but that was not unexpected on a low-cost company. Hand baggage screening was thorough but slow which probably accounted for a small delay. All food/drink was buy-on-board so chose not to partake.

### Transavia customer review
Had a very good flight from Marrakech to Amsterdam with Transavia. The flight was on time very good plane. Flight attendants were very helpful and nice. The leg space was quite decent and the seats comfortable.

### Transavia customer review
Flight from Sal to Amsterdam via Banjul. Despite paying extra for my front row seat was told that from Sal to Banjul was free seating so ended up in row 5. No big deal as a light load. Order restored in Banjul and back in the correct seats. Flight from Banjul to Amsterdam very good crew attentive and hard working IFE available and excellent aircraft with new sky interior.

### Transavia customer review
I flew from Paris to Naples and the flight was 12 hours late. I had an important event in Naples to attend. Nobody from the crew was able to tell us what happened and when would the plane actually take off. This was an appalling service that I absolutely don't recommend to anyone.

### Transavia customer review
ORY-KEF. Online check-in was not working but the check-in at the airport was fast an efficient. No meal included but the flight is so late that you probably would not want to eat anyway. Helpful and understanding staff overall a good experience considering the price.

### Transavia customer review
I flew with Transavia 3 weeks ago from Eindhoven to Tenerife. We had some problems but I liked how the airline dealt with them. Also we flew very cheaply. The food was okay. The inflight movie was a good movie but you needed to buy headsets! I really can recommend the airline for it's customer service on-time and excellent cabin attendants. Shame about the movie but it's a good airline and I recommend it.

4 Aug 2013 Porto - Funchal (Madeira) TO 3406. Return 12 Aug 2013 Funchal (Madeira) - Porto TO 3965. It is a low cost airline but compared to others it is probably best that I've travelled. Checked in fast and went to assigned seats.

### Transavia customer review
Flight delayed due to mechanical reasons 2 hour updates until they told us a plane would be coming in 6 hours from Paris when we were in Santorini. I don't know why they couldn't send one from Athens which is 30 mins away. Ended up being 12 hours in the airport they told us at 19.00 so there was no option to arrange a new flight. Staff rude and not helpful even when just asking for details. Got to Paris at 3am instead of 3pm.

### Transavia customer review
My worst (non)-flying experience. It was during the 11-14th June 2013 strike by French air traffic controllers. Our Transavia flight was due to leave at 19.00 on 12th June. First they pushed departure back to 20.30 then to 00.30 then 00.45. Finally the plane arrived and the passengers disembarked and we anticipated that at last we would be leaving but then they told us the flight was cancelled because they needed the plane elsewhere. No other explanation. The staff maintained minimal levels of politeness but didn't really seem to care very much. They also told us they would not refund the money would not offer another flight hotel or transport really unbelievable. Their recommendation was that we should go home very helpful at 1 in the morning if you live in Spain! The outward flight was also delayed but at least they got us there. The cabin was cramped and the seats pretty uncomfortable.

Flew from Malaga to Amsterdam. The trip was pleasant and comfortable the staff helpful. Check in was slow with a lot of people travelling. Amsterdam was efficient. I wish all flights were as easy as this.

### Transavia customer review
Flew Rotterdam-Prague return. Both flights clean punctual and cabin crew helpful. Green livery perhaps even more garish than Ryanair's. However just 70EUR for a round-trip Rotterdam is a fantastic airport and there were no problems in Prague. There was even IFE which was an episode of Modern Family and was more than adequate for the 90 minute flight. Would certainly fly with again when I'm back in the Netherlands.

Flew back from VLC to AMS on 11/5/2013 with the larger Boeing 737-800 which was fully booked. Unfortunately for some reason it was not possible to check-in online. Arriving 2.5 hours before departure the check-in desk didn't open for another half hour. Check-in was smooth with seats at row 1A/B still available (more legroom). Flight departed 10 minutes late. The aircraft was fully booked but staff managed to get everybody seated in a short time (some seats had been checked-in twice but staff handled this efficiently and friendly). As the computer for credit-card / pin payments wasn't working it was only possible to pay cash for the drinks and meals no in-flight sales. Flight arrived on schedule in AMS but as it landed on the Polderbaan it takes almost another 15 minutes to arrive at the gate (D56). Baggage arrived approx. a half hour later which by Schiphol standards is pretty good.

### Transavia customer review
Selected Transavia for a short break. Outward from AMS to VLC on 5/5. Check-in was done 24 hours in advance and was easy and changed our seats from row 19E / 19F to row 1D / 1E. This row gives you a bit more legroom which is very nice as my wife and I both have long legs. Flight left Amsterdam on time. Staff helpful and attentive. We arrived approx. 20 minutes early and disembarking was quick. Baggage arrived a few minutes later. All in all a pleasant flight.

### Transavia customer review
FCO-RTM I rarely travel by air while in Europe and had no expectation with Transavia turned out it was a pretty good flight. Cabin attendants good and helpful. There was only problem during check in when we saw the schedule on FCO departure information screen showing the flight is actually depart one hour before the scheduled time with no explanation. Luckily we were at the airport early and asked the check in staff about that and she had no clue. Other passengers were also confused and unaware of the change. However flight departed on the original schedule. Apart from that the flight was fine and on time.

### Transavia customer review
From BLQ to EIN both flights in the afternoon in regular weather situation on a 747-700. Crew were quite fair with passengers both at the airport and on board. They passed only once with the trolley with beverages and food. Average seat space and clean. Just a little delay at on-boarding operations. Online check-in very useful but only for Eindhoven airport it would be great having it at Bologna too. Everything was as one would expect for a low cost company to me and most important I had no bad experience in hidden additional costs as I've had with other (more famous) companies.

### Transavia customer review
AMS-FAO-AMS. Going out on a GOL aircraft (inside) more or less ok. Flying Blue members can use the lounge at Schiphol but not fast track. Transavia has finally added the possibility to check in online for return flights but this was not working for Faro airport due to technical difficulties said the website. Return flight incredibly uncomfortable new seats are extremely small and seat pitch is just agony. Although this flight also has a KLM flight number no miles are accrued and no lounge access in Faro.

### Transavia customer review
Flight from NCE to AMS. Punctual flight arrived on time but had to taxi all the way to the gate from the furthest runway of the airport. Good service on board very nice cabin crew. Very busy flight on busy route after Christmas and New Year not the cheapest fares.

### Transavia customer review
Faro to Rotterdam. Poor safety standards - took a long time to board passengers because of the amount of hand luggage. Then when the flight came to land the steward started retrieving the bags of the passengers who had been forced to put their bags in lockers several rows from their seats. As we were on final approach passengers started wandering up and down the aisles to identify bags. Then the bags were left in the aisle as we were touching down.

### Transavia customer review
HV5078 NCE-RTM on 14 Oct. Bad weather resulting in partial airport closure. Initially flight delayed by 3 hours but passengers were allowed to check in and wait at departure gate. Flight further delayed and rescheduled to leave next morning (12 hours delay). Passengers forced to leave departure level to the main level and "recheck in" again next morning. Complete chaos at the airport ground personnel never bothered nor cared to arrange hotels for stranded passengers blaming adverse weather and non availability of hotels. Dinner coupon of 5 euro offered which you could buy a stale cold sandwich. Spent entire night sitting and waiting and thus flew out next morning after spending 15 hours. Transavia could have been kind enough and courteous to offer free tea/coffee on the flight way back considering this huge delay.

### Transavia customer review
Flew from Paris to Mykonos. Very long lines. Check-in staff gossiping with their colleagues. Plane took 45 minutes to take off after departure time. Seats weren't cleaned from previous flight (crumbs and chewing gum). 3 euros for a glass of water.

### Transavia customer review
TXL-AMS. Flight was on time but seats on 737 cramped. Attentive flight attendants. One of them tried to make announcements in German but that was rather embarrassing. Offering web check-in from foreign airports would be a huge improvement. But paid 39 euro all in so Transavia can be a great deal.

### Transavia customer review
ALC-AMS. Check-in at Alicante was a mess if only you could check-in online. Onboard happy and friendly crew. New 737 with decent legroom overhead entertainment. Deplaning took ages. Travel this route every month every flight is different but in general ok very dependant on the crew.

### Transavia customer review
VLC-AMS. The boarding arrangements appear to be poorly managed with little evidence of co-ordination or teamwork. The already delayed flight was subjected to additional delay because of the inefficient boarding system. Cabin crew stood aside as passengers took their time to place their luggage while blocking the aisle. There is little sense of urgency or purpose on the part of the crew. I narrowly missed a connecting flight in AMS as a result.

### Transavia customer review
Orly-Heraklion return. Tickets are cheap if you buy at least 1 month in advance. All flight on time aircraft clean and modern B737-800. Onboard crew were nice the seats comfortable with good legroom. Both inbound and outward the plane was not full so I moved to another seat without any problems.

### Transavia customer review
Paris Orly to Luxor return from Hurghada to Paris Orly. The flights themselves were as good as on any other airline. I appreciate being able to pre-reserve an emergency exit seat for a supplement of 20 Euros. However I have downgraded my score because of one very unpleasant incident - 3 weeks before the return flight I was contacted to be told the flight times had changed from 13.00 on Saturday to 01.55 on Sunday. I found this unacceptable but was able to re-route via Hurghada instead even though this meant an additional 4 hour road journey. But that is preferable to a miserable short half night flight.

### Transavia customer review
No check-in machines available at Alicante and no online check-in so had to queue for boarding card with only hand luggage. On boarding there were other passengers in the seats I had reserved. Passengers refused to move and spoke only Dutch but none of the crew came to help there was no welcome aboard. My seat was broken and would not return to the upright position and when asked to rectify this on landing I explained the seat was broken only to receive the reply that Transavia is a low fare airline. I was offered no assistance whatsoever.

### Transavia customer review
I was supposed to be at the airport 3.5 hrs prior to departure but the desk didn't open until 1.5-2 hrs before. No one at the gate until 30 mins before departure. Staff when they finally showed up were unfriendly. Poor service onboard the only service are the trolleys with merchandise I had to opportunity to buy a drink just once. Only 5 kg is allowed for hand luggage and only 1 bag.

### Transavia customer review
Djerba-Nantes. Operated by the Dutch Transavia since the French sister company had a broken down plane. Crew all Dutch but Dutch purser spoke almost fluently French when addressing passengers in aisle. Very attentive crew (better than French Transavia crew) who were present a lot in aisle even during a night flight to Nantes. Pity the entertainment program was not in French but Dutch subtitled (probably the result of the Dutch branch taking over this particular flight). Very pleasant experience!

### Transavia customer review
Amsterdam-Athens. Transavia was the third airline used on a recent trip and were by far the best. From easy online check in to modern clean aircraft with friendly efficient staff. The on-board snack menu and the cost of the items were about the same as other low cost airlines and entertainment was ok for a short flight. This flight also left on time which is a rarity these days.

### Transavia customer review
Paris Orly to Granada Spain return. Web check-in available and working except for seat allocation not possible to change it even after ringing Transavia hotline (miserable service). Aircraft clean and modern poor inflight entertainment cabin crew friendly but not very professional. Good food and drink service - as a low cost airline everything has to be paid for but quality is OK. Aircraft delayed both inbound and outward without any explanation or apologies given approx. 1 hr late on each leg this airline does not look very efficient however the price paid is OK and Paris Orly much better than Roissy even though it is still a bad airport where something goes always wrong this time the bus to disembark was not there and we had to wait for 30 mins in the aircraft. Transavia seems OK if you go on holiday and are not too fussy about excellence or punctuality.

### Transavia customer review
Amsterdam-Barcelona and back. While going I had 1 checked bag and 3 handbags - no problem. I paid for 1 bag. On the way back exactly the same bags and no extras but I was forced to check 3 instead of 1 and was charged 30 euros. The reason the bags even though 5-6 kgs (within the 10 Kg limit) were an inch or two outside the dimensions. When I got on the flight half of the people were cribbing as they went thru the same and the other half were carrying large bags in the cabin. It was sheer misconduct of one of the ladies checking in this flight. If you went to the man you were fine - if you went to this lady she was forcing everyone to check. But we couldn't do anything she was the boss.

### Transavia customer review
AMS-BCN-AMS was able to book a day return a day ahead for 140 euros. Online check works only for a few airports including Amsterdam. Could use fast track security and KLM Lounge with Elite plus card but no miles on flights. Transavia colored 737 but inside it was half a GOL plane and half another airline with ridiculous change of decor half way the aircraft. Seat pitch is tight no inflight screens. Catering is for sale only with above average prices. Crew just ok. Arrival in old terminal in Barcelona that looks bad with all stores closed. Transavia does not allow for web check-in on return flights so had very long queue. I was told the flight was full but plane left with 20% open seats so I guess the remaining passengers got stuck at check in.

### Transavia customer review
Malaga - London Gatwick return. I was going to travel for a return flight with Monarch Airlines which got cancelled and got switched to a flight with Transavia. The crew were miserable in-flight entertainment was good but it was Dutch with no subtitles and there were only English and Spanish-speaking passengers on the flight.

### Transavia customer review
Booked a flight to Barcelona with Transavia on November 14th. Now they are informing me that they intend to cancel all flights to Barcelona but they will not refund money until the final decision. And they are not even state a date then they will made that decision. Very soon" they tell. 10 days is very soon? They do not tell anything about will they fly or not but do not return money. And meanwhile ticket prices for other companies are increasing. Very unreliable company.

Paris-Oporto. Departure from Paris Orly airport much closer to town and customer friendly. Easy check in the evening before via their website possibility to choose your seat for free! Easy luggage check in at the airport no queue same for security checks. Welcoming and attentive crew. As a low cost you pay for a drink or sandwich but you can have hold luggage for free. Oporto-Paris Orly. Easy check-in this airport is wonderfully organized again departure and arrival on time a bit difficult to get luggage at Orly but still much better than CDG.

Last February I booked a return flight with Transavia Toulon-Amsterdam for June 9 return June 14. This morning I had a message that my return flight was re-booked for June 16 and that there would be extra charges if I could not accept the date change. This is absolutely unacceptabler. I took a cancellation insurance but Transavia made it expire on June 14.

### Transavia customer review
Marrakesh-Amsterdam viaAgadir. Chaotic boarding in RAK all pax disembarked at Agadir due to cleaning and fuelling. Flight back to ams took another 4 hours. Transavia offers B737/700 or 800 service with overhead ife and audio - everything onboard is charged for earphones 3EUR sandwiches 4EUR water 2.50EUR which should be free on a 6 hour flight. This a la carte buy on board service takes a long time crew friendly and focussed on selling products. Not recommended due to hidden high extras. .

### Transavia customer review
RAK-ORY. Online booking effortless. I later paid 15 euros online to reserve an exit row seat. The 737-800 was in excellent condition - interiors even a bit stylish and the music hip. Service friendly. Food for sale was mostly sandwiches fruit soup and salad and pretty good.

### Transavia customer review
Nothing good to say. My flight (Luton-Rotterdam) was cancelled and no information or assistance given whatsoever. They refuse to compensate it according to EU regulations. I have been using them before quite regularly and cancellations and delays have happened in the past more than by any other airline. The planes are ok although not very clean. FA are not service oriented although quick and effective. I dont use this airline anymore due to all above mentioned problems. Avoid them.

### Transavia customer review
Very disappointing airline. They cancelled our flight to Rotterdam - after they had boarded us on the plane for a long time and then we had to disembark. Very mixed messages about how we were to get to Rotterdam. We only found out after re-booking on another airline that they were offering an alternative flight but from another airport - and this was already about 5 hours after our scheduled departure. Now refuse to give any compensation.

### Transavia customer review
AMS to Venice. Flight on time (only half full) fast boarding etc. For tall people UNSUITABLE. You have to be smaller than 1.90 or with short legs because legspace is absent. This was compensated by the nice crew IFE and fast delivery of luggage. I'd like to note them as 2 STAR for objective criteria but give them 3 for the nice crew and speediness of operations.

### Transavia customer review
Luton - Rotterdam return. First time with Transavia so not to sure what to expect. Luton is not my first choice of airport but the check in and security checks were very quick and efficient. Boarding was on time and trouble free. It is so much easier when you have a seat allocated (unlike some other airlines). FA's attentive and friendly. The 737 -700 was comfortable enough for this short flight. Return trip the following day was a similar experience . All in all very good value for money.

### Transavia customer review
Rome to Copenhagen took over 6 (six!) hours delayed with a detour around Napoli and much waiting. The cabin crew herded passengers around the plane several times during the boarding and nobody from the company expressed any kind of regret for the delays or discomfort. Furthermore baggage was delayed by more than 30 minutes when we finally arrived in Copenhagen. My experience with this company was altogether bad and I will never fly with them again. Avoid them at all cost.

### Transavia customer review
Some carriers are flying to Alicante and Valencia but transavia.com is still my first pick. affordable rates when you book early. Although food and drinks onboard pretty expensive (cup of coffee 25 euro's). Even so they offer great service on a short flight. Inflight entertainment is shown crew is professional and the seats are pretty comfortable for these short hubs. Cabin crew speaks fluent english. Even free magazines are sometimes onboard and so are newspapers on the homeward leg. Modern planes clean overall and toilets that are cleaned after the flight.

### Transavia customer review
Return flight Paris-Funchal. Funchal airport is excellent. Clean aircraft and almost in time. Cabin crew was attentive and smiling.
