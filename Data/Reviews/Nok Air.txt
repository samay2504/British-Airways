### "enforced a 7kg total baggage limit"
Not Verified |  Very disappointing experience with Nok Air. At Chumphon airport, they strictly enforced a 7kg total baggage limit, including hand luggage and made customers pay extra fees, even for small excesses. Staff were unfriendly and unhelpful. My advice: add check-in baggage when you purchase your ticket to avoid paying high fees at the airport. I wouldn’t fly with them again

### "Baggage allowance is much less"
Baggage allowance is much less than other flights, so if you're travelling around Thailand be aware of this. Staff member told me to take all heavy items out of under luggage i told her i was going to remove my toiletries; which were then all taken from the scanner team at Krabi (who were rude). Would of been cheaper to pay the additional baggage charges than replace all my lost items. I think the staff member should of told me i was at risk if losing them!! Have given ground service a 2star due to the reason above. However, they did organise a wheelchair as i had had a fall and couldnt walk. This was greatly appreciated.

### "did the job perfectly"
A quick hop from Bangkok to Chiang Rai here. No frills did the job perfectly, left slightly early and arrived well on time. Seats comfortable for an hours flight. I still love the liveries of the airline.

### "prohibited us from using phones"
The flight price was good. The carry on was free but when we started boarding they told us we couldn’t have both a carry on and a personal item so they charged us. The trays in the plane were dirty  The flight attendants prohibited us from using phones during the flight.

### “wants to squeeze money out of everyone”
I bought ticket from Nok Air 3 months in advance to fly from Phuket to Bangkok and Bangkok to Chiang Rai on August 20th 2024. Days before, they cancelled the second connecting flight and I had to buy a different flight. Nok Air would not let me buy checked baggage and I had to contact Trip. However, trip was not able to get through and so I had to buy it at the airport. It was no problem until they lied and said my baggage was 18 kg when it was only 13 kg. I had to pay extra fees of 2000 bahts. The airline sucks and wants to squeeze money out of everyone.

### "do not recommend Nok Air"
One of my flights were cancelled (Bangkok-Phitsanulok) and I am battling since several weeks to get my money back Several e-mails and they never sent proof that they refunded the money. Really annoying. Also the 2nd part of my flight was delayed for almost 4 hrs. I do not recommend Nok Air.

### "Good low cost carrier"
Just normal and non eventful flight, left on time, arrived slightly early, no problems, friendly staff, check in fine, no complaints. Good low cost carrier.

### “forced to pay extra”
We book two tickets from Ubol Ratchathani to Bangkok with NOK Air, when we got to the airport we were forced to pay an extra 1200 baht per bag, the bags were around 15kgs each, to ask for extra payment in my opinion is downright deception and stealing, I will never use this airline again.

### "we have not been refund yet"
We had a scheduled flight from Phitsanulok to Bangkok on 24th January 2024. The flight was cancelled without sending any email. We discovered the cancellation directly at airport and Nok air counter was closed. As we catched and paid double price with another company, we reached Nok air counter on Bangkok airport and asked for refund. Since that day we have not been refund yet.

### "never issued a refund"
They cancelled our flight and never issued a refund, they keep saying it will be done, after almost 2 months. I wish I have read reviews about them before deciding to fly with them, they seem a scam company.

### “better to fly with another airline”
I have been flying with Nok Air many times and their flights are alway delayed. If you have another connecting flight or urgent matter to do after the flight it is better to fly with another airline.

### "more reliable domestic carrier in Thailand"
Both flights were cancelled days before the booked departure. Alternative flights were offered, but timing was not convenient. So I had no choice. Flights uneventful on ancient B738‘s, who have seen better days. Staff friendly. Return flight delayed by an hour, no information provided, flight status on NOK website did not reflect the delay. Overall, there are better and more reliable domestic carrier in Thailand

### "it is always delayed"
I have been travelled with this airline many times and it is always delayed. Best for you to avoid their flights if you have an important schedule afterwards.

### "not my choice for future flights"
I've flown with Nok Air for the second time from Phuket to Bangkok. The first time, the flight was delayed for over two hours, and this time was even more extreme—delayed from 9:15 pm to 1:10 am, with no explanation. All passengers were left waiting without any communication. Definitely not my choice for future flights.

### "no refund was initiated"
Not Verified |  This is the worst airline service I had the displeasure to be part of. The flight was cancelled for maintenance purposes and no refund was initiated after letting them know about the option. It's been over two months and I have been following up regularly but most of the time the mails are unanswered. The flights are frequently cancelled under the guise of maintenance but no refund is ever issued even after you avail the option.

### "canceled my reservation"
Not Verified |  Nok Air's recent handling of my flight from Ubon Ratchathani to Chiang Mai has left me deeply perturbed. Just three days before my scheduled flight, Nok Air canceled my reservation without providing any form of compensation, despite the immense disruption this caused to my meticulously planned journey. My need to reach Chiang Mai on the very day I had booked my flight was non-negotiable, making their cancellation all the more unforgivable. With no viable alternative offered by the airline, I was left with no choice but to embark on a grueling 14.5-hour bus ride, enduring hardship and discomfort. In an attempt to rectify the situation, Nok Air had initially promised to refund the money I had paid for the flight, but the promises soon turned hollow. They insisted that it would take 45 business days for the funds to be returned to me, an intolerable delay given the urgency of the situation. During this seemingly endless waiting period, I diligently corresponded with Nok Air via multiple emails, inquiring about the status of my refund. The 45 days finally came to an end, and I reached out to Nok Air as instructed, only to be met with another layer of distress. They coldly informed me that the money had been sent and advised me to check my bank account. I followed their instructions meticulously, scrutinizing every bank statement, only to be met with disappointment. The funds remained conspicuously absent, and this lack of transparency painted a disconcerting picture.

### "No complaints at all"
No complaints at all, this flight at all. Left on time and landed early. It’s a no frills airline, for the price you can’t go wrong. Seats are a little worn but livery’s are superb.

### "airline is an ok choice"
The airline is an ok choice for travelling in Thailand. The planes felt a bit dated and needed to be replaced with modern cabins that feature tablet holders and free wifi like other low cost airlines do. Don Mueang Airport is dated and should add more facilities, Phuket Airport was alright during arrivals.

### "staff were friendly and trip was smooth"
Everything but the airline website was great. Departure was on time, staff were friendly and trip was smooth. Only issue was the booking website, where you need to pay an extra 500 baht or $18 USD fee for credit cards, essentially acting as a hidden fee. Also, the Nok website on a mobile is very poor. The drop-down menu gets in the way when you want to do anything, rendering the website useless. Much better and cheaper to book through an agency like Klook or Agoda.

### "Unbelievable! So frustrated"
First the airline changed the flight for about 1 hour (not a big deal for me) then when we arrived at the gate to board, the airline changed the gate from g.3 to g.7, then again from g.7 to g.14, and then again from 14 to 11! After all the gate changes, the flight was delayed! (More than half an hour when posting). After we took the bus to the plane the airline let the passengers line up melting to entrance the aircraft under the strong sun and boiling hot!! Unbelievable! So frustrated!

### "destination was cancelled"
Not Verified |  Flight was cancelled. Actually, destination was cancelled, and we weren’t notified. Apparently NOK stopped flying to Mae Hong Son in April 2023, but still took a payment from us for two tickets. No notification from NOK whatsoever. We had to arrange flight to Chiang Mai (obvs with a more reliable airline), and a 6 hour bus to Mae Hong Son. The booked and paid for flight was scheduled for 14 days prior to this review, still no contact or refund from NOK, despite several attempts by me to contact them.

### "For a 50 minute I couldn’t complain"
The liveries on the Nok Air planes are superb. Bright and a great stand out feature. The flight left on time and bags were collected very quickly at the other end. Seats are worn and dirty. For a 50 minute I couldn’t complain.

### "unfortunately a very unreliable airline"
Not Verified |  Unfortunately, my destination is only served by Nok Air and another low-cost airline. Of these two airlines, Nok Air has the most flights to choose from so I have traveled regularly with Nok Air since they started operations in 2004. The problem with Nok Air is that they cancel flights all the time, sometimes without notifying their customers. As a customer, you yourself must regularly check that your flight has not been cancelled, because you cannot rely on getting that information from the airline. Last year I discovered myself that my flight had been cancelled and contacted Nok Air and they promised me a refund within 45 days but I was not refunded as promised. I then started to send daily messages via the website demanding a refund but no response even once from the airline. After more than 3 months I finally got my money back, they probably got tired of my daily messages. Nok Air is unfortunately a very unreliable airline and not to be recommended, choose another airline if possible.

### "Never again unless unavoidable"
Not Verified |  Out of 5 flights with this airline in recent months, 4 were delayed more than 1 hour, 1 was cancelled. Lesson learned. Never again unless unavoidable. The cabin interiors seem super worn, but that's the least of their many many problems. Take AirAsia instead if you can. Way better on time performance in my experience.

### "dont fly this airline"
Flight cancelled, never got a refund after countless mails. Absolute scam, dont fly this airline. I have flown with them before, and it was alright but if there is any problem, you lose all your money.

### "I'll never fly with Nok again"
Not Verified |  Complete scam. I booked a flight including baggage for $72. A couple hours before the flight I got an email saying my baggage booking had been canceled and refunded (I was in a taxi for the airport when I saw the email). So I went to the checkin counter they said I could checkin my baggage only if I paid an extra $20. I showed them that I had already booked for the baggage at $72, not $92 but they didn't care. I got angry at this clear bait and switch scam and complained to the supervisor. Myself and 2 other customers had the same issue. This is clearly how this airline always operates, they can't just be an honest carrier, they feel compelled to scam their customers. For me, I'll never fly with Nok again, please learn from my example and avoid these thieves.

### "shambles of an airline"
They cancelled my flight, told me they would refund me in 45 days and have failed to do so. I am now having to pursue a claim through Visa. Do not fly with this shambles of an airline.

### "Cabin staff were on the ball"
This was our first flight with Nok Air. On check in the young lady already was aware that we needed the wheel chair she also moved us from row 6 to row 4 closer to the boarding door. Cabin staff were on the ball both ways. On arrival to Bangkok a wheel chair was ready to assist, he took us from the aircraft to AirAsia check in for our next flight.

### "canceled without reason"
My flights on November 17th return from Bangkok to Buriram has been canceled without reason. They promised to refund in the 45 days but finally you not get any refund. No response when you contact the company.

### "crew took pride in their work"
As expected the plane arrived late and caused a 1.5 hour delay, but to their credit they managed to turn the plane around in just a mere 45 minutes, including disembarking, boarding and paperwork, therefore partially making up for lost time. Just factor in a delay of an hour or two and be mentally prepared for it to happen from such a no-frills airline and one will keep expectations in check. The crew took pride in their work and executed their job well.

### "Everything about the flight was – low cost"
The cheerful canary yellow uniforms of the flight crew are matched by the livery of their aircraft - If only the happiness went into their attitude as well. Yes, they are a low-cost carrier, and I am sure the crew doesn’t have the same work environment as the crews of higher-end airlines – but that is no justification for a bad attitude. Everything about the flight was – low cost. They have so much potential - at least they had a Skybridge at DMK and HKT.

### "not informed about the cancellation"
We had booked our Trip Through Goibibo for the early flight via NOK AIR from Phuket to Bangkok On 21 sep 2022 at 7.45 AM. On reaching the airport at 6 AM it was mentioned that the flight got cancelled but we were not informed about the cancellation through any means prior or after. When we tried to contact their (NOK AIR) office at Phuket airport it was closed. Then we had booked another flight through AirAsia and reached Bangkok and enquired at Nok air office at Bangkok. They told that it will be refunded after 45 days and no other proper response. Even in call center number there was no response.

### "price for the route is ridiculous"
Flight was delayed without any announcement. Ground staffs arrived to the gate at boarding time. The screen of the gate still shown the previous flight. The price for the route is ridiculous.

### "terrible service"
Delayed from Trang DD599 31st July. Staff repeatedly lying about delay and departure schedule. We will not travel on Nok again unless it is 110% essential travel. All Nok customers should be made aware of this terrible service.

### "cancelled, re-scheduled, delayed"
Worst airline experience of my life. In a span of 3 days my flight was cancelled, re-scheduled, delayed, then changed altogether. Trying to contact the customer service number will take at least 1.5 hours on hold. The most unreliable and unresponsive airline ever. I would recommend taking any other airline regardless the difference in price, it will save you peace of mind.

### "the open ticket expired"
Due to Covid19 (plus local travel restrictions), I could not take the flight as planned and opted for an open ticket. Instead of doing what other airlines are doing (extending validity), NokAir only allowed I think six months, and then the open ticket expired. Which means NokAir kept my money, refuses refund.

### "refusing to refund my tickets"
Bangkok to Chiang Mai booked for the end of May 2020. I cannot leave the USA due to COVID-19 restrictions on Thailand and Dallas Texas. Nok Air is refusing to refund my tickets. This is unfair, because there was no virus when I booked these tickets. Nok Air is not doing what is right for the customer. I will never do business with NOK air again. Nok AIR please reach out to me to resolve this issue.

### "avoid this company"
Not Verified |  Bangkok to Krabi. They cancelled our flights from Bangkok to Krabi return, although promised a refund within max 45 business days. 2 months have passed now. No one ever replied to my emails, they hang up the phone when I try calling them. Twitter and Facebook haven't been helpful as well. Please guys, avoid this company if you do value you time and money.

### "a bag was not included"
Not Verified |  Phuket to Bangkok. They charged me $170 US dollars for my bag because it was in the fine print that a bag was not included. This was more than the cost of the flight. Once I was on the plane, I put my bag in my overhead compartment as I was in an emergency row, turned my devices off, and went to sleep. I was woken up 3 times by flight attendants asking me to put my seat up straight, while it was already all the way up, making it clear that the drinks were there, and asking me if my bag was under my seat - it is not, because I put it in my overhead bin like you told me.

### "exceeded my expectations"
Bangkok to Phuket. I had zero expectations prior to flying with Nok Air as it was on a cheap short flight. But this airline has exceeded my expectations. Staff were nice and friendly even giving us a small bottle of water. Not a lot of leg room and it was only a 40 minute flight anyway. Cheap and fast.

### "crew was very friendly"
Ho Chi Minh to Bangkok. Top service from beginning to end. Aircraft was clean and spacious and the cabin crew was very friendly. No wait times on either end and our luggage was returned ASAP.

### "not worth the savings"
Ho Chi Minh to Bangkok. They will not let you book a ticket without having a return flight. The website is horrible to book a ticket as well you cannot add check in baggage with just one person only. The website made me buy 2 check in luggage for two people. and then when I try to book a second ticket separately they blocked me from being able to purchase a second ticket. I had to go to the airport customer service and they charged me double the price of the ticket. It is a cheaper airline but it’s not worth the savings.

### "the price is quite high"
Mae Sot to Bangkok. It was okay. The flight was on time today and the service went well. But as always their Q400 is quite tight and bad legroom. Also the price is quite high for low cost airline.

### "Don’t fly with this airline"
Bangkok to Mae Sot District with Nok Air. Don’t fly with this airline if there are others choices! The legroom on Q400 is horrible! The cabin quite smelly! The service was fine. Way too far from low cost premium airline as they called themselves.

### "has seen my last baht"
Bangkok to Mae Sot. This is by far the worst airlines that I have ever flown. I have had several bad experiences with them but I will just relate todays. Booked 2 tickets a few weeks ago for 5400 baht with only carry on. Ridiculous price for this distance but they are the only airline flying there. My wife who owns a salon was later asked by relatives if she could cut and style their hair for them when we came. Since you cannot carry on scissors we had to check a very small bag. I tried to do this online but because within 24 hours, I was not able. But while on the website I notice my flight time does not match my ticket time. So I call them and find out they had changed the departure time by 1 1/4 hours. I was not even sent an email even though they had at least 18 hours to do so. While on the phone I asked how much for my checked bag and was told 500 baht. Insane price but what can I do. When I check in I am told I now have to pay 900 baht. Outrageous! More than 30% of a ticket price for a couple of kilos on a 50-minute trip. When we went to pay our penalty the lady ahead of us had a very small rolling suitcase about carry on size. I don't know where she was going but this was the domestic terminal. 2000 baht! Another of their shady practices is when booking on their website you must deselect all extras twice. If you don't notice this you will end up paying for luggage, insurance and seat selection. There's another laugh. I wanted to see what would happen if we chose the last row of seats on the plane. Row 51. Well for that it will be another 180 baht. Avoid this crooked airline at all costs. The good thing for me is that Mae Sot has a new terminal and soon a new airstrip. Air Asia and other real airlines are coming. NOK has seen my last baht.

### "the seat is horrible"
The flight was delayed by 70 minutes. The legroom and the seat is horrible comparing to Bangkok Airways. Also it was a bus gate and they just boarded the all the passengers in 1 bus and was too much people and very uncomfortable.

### "never fly this airline again"
Not Verified |  Bangkok to Phuket with flight DD7515. Both the travel to and from Phuket were delayed by nearly an hour. Even during boarding it was very chaotic and no one knew what to do. Colleagues from Nok Air were treated like first class members and were able to board first. We booked a 15 Dollar meal with my flight, which was a very sad, small and overseasoned type of Thai dish with rice and a dry egg. We had to send them back. Both flights did come without any apology or explanation for the delay. We will never fly this airline again.

### "all very impressive"
Easy (fast) check-in, flight left Don Mueang airport on time, arrived in Udon on time, pleasant crew, extremely fast debording, luggage arrived very fast too, all very impressive, and much appreciated!

### "Comfortable seats"
Bangkok to Hat Yai. Perfect flight. Boarding and take off on time. Comfortable seats. Very kind flight attendant service. Landing a bit hard but on time. I was really impressed how boarding was organized.

### "baggage was missing the lock"
Not Verified |  Flight was 20 minutes delayed. At Phuket Airport they have a huge single check in line for all the flights, it doesn't matter if you do the online check in, it takes a long time. You cannot eat your own food on the plane. When we arrived to Bangkok my checked baggage was missing the lock, I asked customer service why they removed the lock and if they could give me the lock back and they said that the lock was not found but they didn't understand our English. We decided to go and leave it like that.

### "Worst experience ever"
Krabi to Chiang Mai via Bangkok. Worst experience ever. The flight from krabi to Bangkok was delayed more than four hours. As a consequence we missed our connection from Bangkok to Chiang mai. In Krabi they informed us we'd take a flight to Chiang mai the next day at 1am. However when we arrived in Bangkok they said we'd have to fly to Chiang Raí and take a 5 hour bus to Chiang mai. We made a lot of complaints and we received no reply.

### "employees refuse to give any information"
Krabi to Bangkok via Chiang Mai. This is the worst airline ever. As I sit here typing this, our plane is delayed over 2 hours and the Nok Air employees refuse to give any information. We will be missing our connecting flight and we sat in line for an hour to get attended to. The staff ignored everyone in line and began taking selfies. They also kept running away and ultimately gave us meal vouchers to a restaurant that was closed. There is still no resolution. There is still no plane. We are in Nok limbo torture land. Never purchase with them!

### "not pay the baggage fees online"
Chiang Mai to Phuket via Bangkok. Nok Air is the only airline I’ve ever flown that charges you a baggage fee per connecting flight. Thus, in addition to paying its already exorbitant baggage fees, I had to pay it twice, because I had a layover in Bangkok. Part of the reason the baggage fees were so high is that we could not pay the baggage fees online. Its website is garbage and hasn't been updated in a while (probably because they want you to pay the higher fees at the airport). None of this is advertised or disclosed that I saw. On top of this, the customer service was horrible because the agents are unable to explain the baggage policies either because they couldn’t speak English well enough or they just didn’t understand the airline’s baggage policy. Bottom line: You may think you’re saving money flying with NokAir, but if you are flying with any bags, save your time and money and fly a different airline.

### Pleasant uneventful flight"
Udon Thani to Bangkok. Pleasant uneventful flight, friendly crew, clean aircraft, arrived early, quick luggage delivery at Don Mueang airport. Check-in in Udon? Male agent could not be bothered opening his mouth to say for instance hello or something as simple as that, entire check-in process was done in complete silence at 6.45am, maybe he was still tired.

### "departed and landed on time"
Chiang Mai to Bangkok. Nok Air is a Low cost carrier so I was surprised they served a small bottle of water. It's not much but still a nice gesture. Flight departed and landed on time, but landing was really rough and bumpy.

### "no clarity on baggage policy"
Phuket to Bangkok. There is no clarity on Nok Air baggage policy. Even staff is not able to explain the policy correctly to me. Airport customer agent was insisting for getting money and was not ready to listen what I was trying to say.

### "refused overnight accommodation"
Booked Phuket to Buriram return in March and April mainly because you can through check all the way and I was aware of the complications that can arise if you have a multi sector itinerary on different airlines. Nok air cancelled 3 of the 4 Bangkok - Buriram return sectors. Plus cancelling one Phuket - Bangkok sector. On two occasions meaning we missed our connection and had to overnight Bangkok. What they do is send a “revised “ flight time when clearly they have amalgamated two flights into one and cancelled one of the services. They flatly refused to offer overnight accommodation in Bangkok and used every available tool to avoid this. Offering flights at ridiculous times and even once a connection on another airline. This was totally unacceptable as with delays it could have meant us getting stuck between two airlines neither accepting responsibility and precisely the reason we booked a complete itinerary with Nok Air in the first place. So,twice we had to pay for hotel accommodation ourselves! Basically avoid them like the plague as it seems they cancel flights at will. I see other reviewers have had similar experiences. Also some of the 737-800 look dated and in need of refurbishment. They did give us”premium” seats at no cost but on 4 sectors there was zero priority boarding for premium customers. Emails to customer service have not been replied to and on at least 4 occasions the people on their 1318 hotline have lied. That’s when you manage to get through to them. The overall extra cost to me/us has been in the region of 6-7000 baht. No hope whatsoever of Nok Air refunding that.

### "I'd fly Nok again"
Bangkok to Krabi. Nok is a true budget airline: a little gritty, rough around the edges, and you're never really comfortable in terms of believing that you'll get where you're going on time. I checked in online and bypassed the ticket counter, but past experiences have been less than easy. If you don't prepay your bags online, you have to check in via one line, go to a bag drop and another line, then go to a payment counter to pay the baggage fee. It's a pretty terrible system. But this time--none of that. Straight to the gate. Don't expect much in terms of announcements, watch for the crowd and go queue up when it's time. Their flights seem to require a bus out to the plane, and that's your typical budget airline experience--they try to get all 150 of you into one to avoid making two trips. The aircraft on my trip was old, and a god bit worn out. Nok chose to paint their planes in a really colorful scheme (I call it "Sky Chicken Fabulous") with a bird head on the nose of the plane. Unfortunately the colors haven't held up well, so the appearance of the plane is shabby and faded even from the outside. The crew is quick and a small bottle of water is included, a nice touch. The English skills of the crew are marginal for an airline that carries a lot of tourists, but if you'e heard the safety presentation before elsewhere, there's not much that the crew has to talk to you about. They advertise WiFi on board, but no Nok flight I've ever flown delivered on that promise. My flight left late and arrived late, but no announcements or apologies were made, it appeared to be just part of a normal Nok day. Air Asia is still the cream of the crop in Thai budget carriers, with VietJet delivering mostly good results as well. Nok joins the second tier with Lion Air. Nok does offer a frequent flyer program which sets them apart, but it requires you to write them and send a copy of your boarding pass to get credit, which is honestly just too much hassle to get a free $25 flight. I'd fly Nok again, but there's nothing that would steer me toward them, either.

### "made an error with my return"
I have travelled with Nok Air many times and probably will in the future. It is not by choice but by necessity because Nok Air has a monopoly on flights to Phrae. There are no other airlines going to Phrae. I don't want to be unfair with my comments but I think the reviews are valuable for people so they know what they can expect. I have booked tickets for 2 people. I made an error with my return day of flight so I had to change the departure date from 21st March to 20th March. It was impossible to get this done on line from Sydney. I had to get friends in Phrae to change the date at the Phrae Airport, they couldn't change it on line either, they could not get any assistance over the phone and my friends are Thai, they were advised to go to the airport, over the phone they were told the charges to make the changes were going to cost 975 Thb per person, at the airport not only was the change of one day difficult but also costly. Nok Air charges 2,778 Thb for this change to be effected not the 975 Thb previously quoted. I think this charge is extortionate. It was my fault for booking the wrong date but Nok Air do not assist or help in any way to make the change easy. It is very difficult to communicate to the staff over the phone when you finally get through to them. The staff have difficulty understanding English and simply lay down their rules without any commpassion or appreciation of the difficulty they place people in. I fly to Thailand regularly and find the international airlines very good and the staff incredibly helpful but the internal flights particularly with Nok Air is not always smooth and the staff even though they are expediting their job...it is only the bare minimum with little if any charm... and the endearing smile people are accustomed to seeing with the friendly Thai people is mostly non existent.

### "cancelled our flight"
This company is absolutely worthless. They cancelled our flight to a later one the same day, but only let us know 1 day on beforehand. Their website is not working properly. You don't get access to check-in, nor for booking luggage : the latest meant we had to pay 1800 baht for 2 persons for 15 kg luggage  one way, that is ). The personnel is far from interested and is just keen to make more profit. The premium water you receive on board is 250 ml, lukewarm and it has a bad taste.

### "aircraft in very good shape"
Bangkok to Ubon Ratchathani. As I started my journey from Ayutthaya, I took a commuter train from their station to Don Mueang Train Station, which is directly located next to Don Mueang's International Airport. Though with more than three hours to spare, we were already allowed to drop off our bags on one of their counters. Our flight was operated by an aircraft that was barely just over a year old and was in a very good shape. The legroom offered for a so-called LCC carrier was very generous and you did not need to fight for any space in the overhead bins. The flight departed on time and complimentary water was provided to you shortly after take off before the Buy on Board service would start. The flight took only 40 minutes and the landing performed by the pilots was excellent. Deboarding of the plane took only a minute or two and our luggage was already on belt before arriving to it's designated belt. The walk from jetbridge to drop off doesn't even take more than two minutes. Good job!

### "flight cancelled the night before"
We purchased 4 tickets from Bangkok to Phuket months in advance for all four of us. Our flight was cancelled the night before departure. Nok Air emailed us that night to tell us of the cancellation and wrote the following: “Please be advised that flight DD7504 on NOV 19 2018 is cancelled due to technical reason. You are entitled for one of the following options, 1.Transfer to other available Flight at Donmuang Airport without any additional charges or change traveling destination DD7500 19NOV2018 DMK – HKT Dep. 06:10-07:35 DD7512 19NOV2018 DMK – HKT Dep. 11:00-12:20 DD7506 19NOV2018 DMK – HKT Dep. 13:35-14:55 DD7514 19NOV2018 DMK – HKT Dep. 15:15-16:35….” We immediately called Nok Air to transfer our flights (the same ones listed “without any additional charges”) but the number continuously went to voicemail. We tried several different numbers and emailed but had no luck. It was very late and we saw online that flights were getting booked up fast, so we did the only thing we could do and just purchased the four tickets ourselves and because it was just hours before the flight the four tickets came out to approximately $500. We had originally paid $171.40 for the four tickets. On the way to the airport, we wrote them a nice email to provide them with our new flight information and receipt so that they could refund and reach back out to us as soon as they could. No response. We made it to Phuket and had a week left of our trip and didn’t think twice about it since we thought that it was a pretty simple issue to resolve. We made it back home to the States and were confused that we had still hadn’t heard back from them. This is where the real headache began.. My fiancé called, waited, explained, called, waited, explained, and called some more, waiting some more, and explained some more, emailed over a dozen times and spoke with a dozen people within a three week span. Sometimes he wouldn’t even get a hold of anyone. Other times we would literally put the phone on speaker phone for an hour to finally speak to someone for 5 minutes who didn’t want to deal with the issue then transfer us to someone else to repeat the whole story again to just be transferred to someone else, then promised something or told to call back at a different hour or some other craziness! Not one Nok Air employee listened to us, they just read from some sort of manual and tried to get rid of us each and every time. Needless to say on the fourth week we were exhausted. They accomplished tiring us out. We spend $171.40 on 4 tickets on a flight that they cancelled to then have to pay $500 to transfer flights that they clearly stated we wouldn’t be charged for! Oh- and here’s the kicker – since we were calling an international number and spending hours on the phone on hold, we were hit with a $300 phone bill at the end of all of this. Just thinking about this again leaves me with the feeling of disgust.

### "staff were really friendly"
Bangkok to Yangon. The check in was very easy and quick, the plane was clean, all the staff were really friendly and helpful, the flight was on time. I would definitely fly again with Nok Air.

### "try and get our flight re-booked"
Krabi to Bangkok. It seems like this airline is really into scamming people. They are not customer service friendly and leave you no options in the end. My vacation took a turn for the worst when my partner fell extremely ill with pneumonia and was hospitalized for 3 days. I called the airline as soon as this happened to try and get our flight re-booked. I was told that they can’t do that and I wouldn’t be able to get my money back either, so after some more convincing on my part they finally said they would do it but I would have to pay an extra 1000 baht (ok fine whatever). So the next flight that we had booked we were still not able to leave the hospital so I called the airline back and explained I couldn’t rebook because I had no way of knowing when we would be able to leave the hospital they said they wanted proof (which ok, that’s fair), and then they might consider rebooking the flight. I asked for a credit so I could book again when we were released, and nothing.

### "got us seats on the next flight"
Bangkok to Phuket. I paid for tickets for me and my family 4 months in advance. We get to check in and were told our flight was cancelled and that they sent me an e-mail three days prior. I asked to be put on another flight there were no seats for the whole day. They offered me a refund but i wasnt willing to just walk away. They offered me and my family to fly stand by but knowing that everything was booked i declined and asked them to put us on another airline which they refused. The desk people although polite were not helpful and did nothing to get us a seat. After finding a manager on my own I insisted that what Nok Air did was wrong and I wasnt going to leave the airport, she then got us seats on the next flight.

### "could not be happier"
Yangon to Bangkok. Perfect, on time, clean, and kind. First time on Nok air and could not be happier. Extra bag checked but prepaid, so I avoided unnecessary problems at the counter. Totally recommended low cost.

### " hasn't disappointed yet"
Nok Air has online Checkin 24 hours before to print out your boarding pass and can go directly to security and gate if one isn't checking a bag. Also you can change your flight for an extra charge online. Everytime I ever needed to call Nok Air they answered promptly. If one has a bag to check like I did there is a special line at Don Muang Airport for those who checked in online. My flight was full during the busy New Year and many people brought on roller bags with other carry ons even though only one small 7 kilo carry on is permitted at the cheapest fare and one must pay a higher fare to check roller bags. The cabin attendant didn't object to these passengers bring on so much but amazingly worked hard to get all the bags into the overhead bins in time for take off. I noticed that nearly everyone did not put small things under the seat in front of them but instead taking up needed space of the overhead bins. The plane departed on time and arrived on time and my checked bag was soon on the carousel. Nok Air hasn't disappointed yet.

### "Customer support very robotic"
Not Verified |  Bangkok to Chiang Mai. Given just 48 hours notice of flight being changed to earlier flight due to festival. Too late by then to change my other connecting flight from Krabi. Customer support very robotic and not great English. Offered no helpful solution to my problem. Will not trust them to fly with them again.

### "cancelled the purchased flight"
Nok Air cancelled the purchased flight with 48 hours notice and advised by email. Replies to request the same day later flight were ignored. 24 hours later I had to ask someone in Thailand to call Nok Air to rebook for me. Turned up for the later flight as planned with luggage of 42kg as recorded by international carrier. Nok scales weighed it at 45.9kg. I complained so they weighed it on another desk where it was back to 42kg! Clearly there is a huge disparity on revenue generating scales! Delay was 7 hours so once journey was complete I attempted to claim 1000 baht insurance as covered according to the policy having opted to spend considerably more on a hotel as the delay was added to a 6 hour wait already necessary due to my inbound international flight. Three weeks later and after numerous emails of nonsense from Nok Air I gave up. They can keep the 1000 baht, I'm flying AirAsia instead, more expensive and not known for customer service but better the Nok Air by a country mile. On board Nok are equally as good or bad as AirAsia depending on your expectations but customer service is not a concept Nok Air has mastered to date.

### "I forgot to pay"
Nok Air is the worst airline I've seen. I went to Phuket airport to check in in the morning and give baggage. They said that the luggage will be taken for a fee. They said they could get my baggage in 1800 baht with the Thai currency. My baggage weight is 30kg for 2 people. I forgot to pay and went to the plane in a hurry. I was not warned by anyone when I got on the plane. I sat in my seats with my wife. 2 minutes to the departure of the aircraft, a woman with a Nok Air staff came to the plane and demanded 1800 baht. I mentioned that I will not give this money to him. Nok Air staff insisted that the woman wanted to take the money. Nok Air gave our passports to the cabin attendant. When we arrived at Bangkok airport, we were waiting for about 1 hour to pay. The worst airline I've ever seen.

### "not offered any reimbursement"
Bangkok to Buriram. Arrived at Don Muang airport this morning two hours before our flight was due to take off we went to the lounge to relax check e mails and get ready for a trip to Buri Ram. We left the lounge at 2pm by the time we got through security and downstairs into the departure lounge it was 2.20pm and was told we couldn't board the flight as it was to late (boarding time was 14.10). There was no call for us on the tanoy and my girlfriends bag had already been taken off the plane. We were not offered any reimbursement or another flight

### "seats are reasonably comfortable"
Recently I flew from Udon Thani to Chiang Mai on Nok Air's turboprop Bombardier Q400, this is my second experience with them (the first one was LPT-DMK back in Dec'2014) as well as this aircraft type. Both times the plane was quite new and clean inside, haven't seen anything broken. This time my seat (which I chose online in advance) was closer to the back of a cabin, and the noise levels were comparable to a jet aircraft, certainly quieter than ATR72 despite the higher speed. The seats are reasonably comfortable (for a regional flight) and with enough legroom. There were no meals (it's LCC anyway), however they provide small bottles of water for free, which is nice. The flight to Chiang Mai took exactly 1 hour and arrived 10 minutes ahead of schedule - no longer than a jet could take, but more eco-friendly. And the price I've paid (promo + 15 kg baggage, booked 12 days in advance) was not much more than for a bus, which would take 12 hours. Definitely will fly again, especially as Nok Air covers more destinations than any other Thai airline, including some small airports no one else flies to. Still have to try their jet service, however.

### "worn out seat, dirty windows"
I booked with Nok Air online for my business trip from Bangkok (DMK) to Chumphon (CJM). Tax certificate can be easily requested online and delivered to my office even before my journey. Their website is user friendly, and I selected my preferred seat well in advance. On departure, I was informed that flight would be 50 minutes delayed with no further explanation. The aircraft was a 3 years old Dash 8 Q400, lovely livery but the sign of poor maintenance and improper cleaning are all over interior. Tray table cannot be used, worn out seat, dirty windows. A small bottle of water is served free of charge by a nice cabin crew. I bought a pack of snack which is nice. The return flight on ATR72 which is an even older aircraft. I had to move to a few vacant seats before finally finding one that can be kept upright. All in all, the experience is fair but I would prefer to fly other airlines if possible.

### "Smart, nearly brand new plane"
On recommendation chanced my arm with a stand-by seat for the onward flight to Chiang Mai. With three planes departing within 10 minutes of one another, Nok Air secured my business for no other reason than it had the shortest queue at the ticket counter. Straightforward to purchase, the price (1500 Baht) little different to that available for an advance booking - providing you stick to the 15kg baggage limit. Rapid check-in but few minutes late departing and arriving. By chance sat in an emergency exit premium seat [no extra cost] so ample room and offered drinks during the flight. Smart, nearly brand new plane. Bags delivered as I arrived at the carousel after short walk from airbridge, walking directly out of the airport.

### "in general it was comfortable"
Took Nok Air from DMK to URT (Champhon) as it offered the earliest flight for the day. First impression is that the airline is really cute, the whole ‘bird’ theme stuck throughout, the planes are painted in different colors and the nose always has a beak. This theme was also present in the cabin service - the stewardesses wore yellow and all the materials were really well thought out to present the brand image. As a PR person this is refreshing - especially from a budget airline. Seat pitch was quite tight, however in general it was comfortable. The service was slightly better than other popular budget airlines brands in Asia. The stewardesses came only once after the seatbelt lights were turned off; and dimmed the cabin lights for us to sleep. I would recommend this brand since I think at least for a budget airline they made the extra effort to stay on theme.

### "will not fly Nok Air anymore"
Hadyai to Bangkok. Today, my Nok Air  flight has been delayed and retimed twice. As a result, it was late more than an hour. Indeed, it's not only one time but I experienced this kind of delay many times. Subsequently, I would like this complaint might help it to improve its service in the future. However, for me, I will not fly Nok Air anymore.

### "unnecessarily complicated procedure"
Hat Yai to Bangkok. Since air fare can be reimbursed with the organization (foreign government development agency), I turned up at their counter in Hat Yai to ask for the receipt/taxi invoice or any kind of document that has my name, flight detail, air fare and the organization name on it, for the reimbursement purpose. The staff informed that no document can be issued here, which for me was a bit strange because other airlines I have used could have done this process in literally a minute. After the trip, I sent the request through their e-mail system. Having waited for a week without any contact back, I decided to contact the call center. The response received was that the consideration was in the process (for god sake, I am not applying for job, just a receipt,, what exactly do you need to consider). Then a week later and still no contact from Nok air, I decided to call them again. This time they said they will follow the case and contact back. I did specifically ask them to contact me back today because I got tired of the chasing. Kindly enough, Nok Air contacted me back on that day, informing that my information for issuing tax invoice was insufficient (took them two weeks to realize that). Then, I explained that what I need is just a document from the airline, not necessarily tax invoice, just a receipt is fine. Then, I was told that a receipt cannot be issued after the travel. In sum, the unnecessarily complicated procedure, lack of customer service, poor case/request tracking system, and inability to solve customers' problem had made Nok Air uncompetitive with other airlines.

### "quite comfortable and timely"
❎ Not Verified |  Flew Yangon to Bangkok  Don Muang. I found Nok to be quite comfortable and timely. I’m 6’2” tall and I had sufficient legroom. I was surprised this was a budget airline. My only qualm about flying with them again is Don Muang Airport. If Nok flew out of BKK, it old be my LCC of choice for Southeast Asian travel out of Bangkok.

### "the last time I book this company"
Phuket to Bangkok. This company is a disaster. When I booked my flight I added an extra luggage of 15kg, which i paid with my booking. When I arrived at the airport, I found out that we all have the right to bring 1 free 15kg luggage. Mine was 21 kg so I told them to make some simple additions : 15 free + 15 paid = 30 kg. They refused to do the maths and asked me to pay 2100 baths (70 dollars) if I wanted to board. This is the last time I book this company.

### "I will never fly with them again"
Hat Yai to Bangkok. Off to a bad start with ticketing. After inadvertently entering ‘Jeff’ as fist name instead of ‘Jeffrey’ was charged an extra 750 baht on a 1600 baht ticket to add the ‘rey’ onto the end of my name. Staff were very inflexible. As Nok Air decided to squeeze an extra 750 baht out of me for this small mistake, I will never fly with them again. Disgraceful.

### "will be my last time with Nok Air"
Ho Chi Minh to Chiang Mai via Bangkok. The worst airline I have ever known. - 3 among 4 flights I took delayed (HCM-BKK-Chiang Mai and Chiang mai-BKK-HCM). But the worst flight was the 4th. We arrived at 5:00pm for the 6:30 flight. It was a long line and finally it was our turn. When we reached the desk they told me that the counter had closed a minute before. It was ridiculous that we waited right in front of them and they just closed the check-in counter without saying a word. We missed the flight and had to buy new tickets for the next day. Most of all, the attitude of the manager and staffs was unacceptable. This definitely will be my last time with Nok Air.

### "impressed me a great deal"
Hanoi to Yangon via Bangkok. Nok Air, best of the LCC's. I've flown many low cost carriers from Turkey to Vietnam, and Nok Air really impressed me a great deal. I bought this ticket because of a promo rate, and I have no regrets. I had heard a rumor that Nok flew old beat up planes, but in reality I flew on near-new Boeing 737-800's (4 flights total). Nok does not nickel and dime the passenger as so many LCC's do - I had a free seat reservation, free 30kg baggage allowance and even a free small snack! Friendly staff, clean planes and on time performance, excellent.

### "lovely ground staff and crew"
Flew Nok Air from Udon Thani to Bangkok. The cabin crew were extremely cheerful and friendly. On top of that, I was served a small package of snacks with water but they were not enough, I had to order some local Thai food-stir fried noodle. Food was great and beyond my expectations. The entertainment is still considered pretty poor - no personal TV but I do understand since it's a short haul with B737. Overall, I would highly recommend thanks to their lovely ground staff and crew.

### "error double booking someone"
Bangkok to Krabi. Just made a little error by double booking someone. Zero help from Nok Air canceling the double booking, or even a partial refund would have been appreciated. It was obvious that it was an error as there are now 2 bookings for 1 person, therefore there will be an empty seat. This rigid stance is annoying. I would have been happy to pay some kind of admin fee and just get a small refund but there is no leeway. Realizing this and calling just 10 minutes after making a booking, it is very disappointing not to have any sympathy and allow a change from Nok Air.

### "lovely airline"
Once again a seamless journey from Roi Et to Bangkok with Nok Air. Check in via the phone application which meant no paper print which was great as out in the country side with no printer. Love the turbo prop aircraft. Get to see the wheels go up and down and also see touchdown. As I am an Engineer to is something you will not see often. You get a small meal which is water and some nibbles. Lovely airline.

### "could not fault it at all"
Bangkok Don Meuang to Phuket. I have flown budget airlines in Europe and all i can describe is you get what you pay for and the airlines try to make more money from you selling you food drink and duty free at inflated prices. So what a refreshing change to be welcomed aboard and helped to my seat by friendly staff. Legroom was adequate and the aircraft was in excellent clean condition. Ten minutes into the flight the cabin crew handed out a small snack and a drink to everyone unheard of in Europe. Then there was a drinks trolley run which was reasonably priced for coffee and soft drinks. Then they came round with Nok Air merchandise but there was no high pressure sales patter going on it was all very relaxed. The captain kept us informed of progress in Thai and English. We will be flying with Nok Air again for sure could not fault it at all well done!!!!! !

### "poor apologies at the counter"
Did book a promotion ticket from Udon Thani to Bangkok and at arrival suddenly they asked to pay 4 times the original ticket price for 14 kilo of luggage! All promotions (see picture today taken at the airport) say 15 kilo is included. Answer is that they recently did change the policy without clear warning on the website. First time after flying many times with them. In the end did rebook quickly to Thai Smile which was cheaper than the baggage extra cost at Nok. False advertising and poor apologies at the counter, but many were forced to pay extra money. Shame on you when the advertising states "We Fly Smiles". Be very careful with this airline.

### "the flight was canceled"
In December 2016 I purchased 4 Nok Air tickets to travel on Feb 16, 2017, from Koh Phi Phi to Bangkok via Phuket (ferry, coach and flight). Two weeks before the trip, I received an email from Nok Air stating that the flight was canceled and that no other options were available. On the basis of this information, I bought another ticket, via Krabi, by Air Asia and asked for the refund. Shortly afterwards Nok Air said they would refund the amount paid. Worst of all is that Nok Air had the same option, via Krabi, which I bought at Air Asia, but it hid me from this fact. And more than 30 days have passed since the flight was canceled and the amount paid was not returned.

### "leg room acceptable"
Bangkok to Roi Et return and chose Nok Air. Much more pleasant experience than last time with Thai AirAsia. Check in early, flight good, small snack provided, leg room acceptable. Would recommend them over Thai AirAsia.

### "will not use again, unless very cheap"
Bangkok Don Muang to Chiang Mai. Nok Air used to be my number one choice for domestic flights but due to the frequent delays and impolite staff I use Thai Smile more frequently for domestic travel. The ticket was on sale and about 30-40% cheaper than Thai Smile, so I chose Nok Air. My expectations were set somewhere in the middle. I had checked in online, and bag drop was orderly, but the staff were cold. Afterwards, boarding was unnecessarily delayed, due to the fact that the plane was parked at a remote stand, when I spot at least 10-15 empty gates. The purser smiles and checks my boarding pass, and helps me find my seat. The seat itself had very bad cushioning, and the plane was ex-Jet Airways (according to my sources). My mum's seat had a problem with the recline, it wouldn't recline, although mine had plenty of recline. Hygiene was a clear problem. I notice they have a 30-40 minute turnaround time, which means the cabin won't be 100% clean. My tray table had crumbs on it and my window had a stain on it. The flight attendants themselves were smiling and seemed happy but they had a bit of a tired look on their faces. The plane pushed back 30 minutes late and arrived 30 minutes late, no surprise, although that did make me have to alter my schedule. The inflight snack had a nice box, however, the cupcake was extremely dry, and the bottle of water they give you is tiny (150 ml) compared to the standard (330 ml). The flight attendants came around with the drink cart, only to serve the "Premium Economy" passengers and frustrated me even more. My baggage arrived 30 minutes after the first bags, altering my schedule and completely making me change my plans. Disappointing. However, if on a budget, I recommend this airline. If not, choose another. I will not use Nok Air again, unless they are very cheap.

### "crew friendly and efficient"
In the past 14 years have traveled Nok Air a hundred times between Chiang Mai and Bangkok and the reverse direction. As usual, a smooth process from check in to baggage arrival at the carousels. Check in easy, seat comfort fine, pre-boarding no problem. Cabin crew friendly and efficient. Baggage arrival at Don Muang so much easier than Suvarnbhumi.

### "you get a lot for your money"
Great flight with Nok Air from Bangkok to Hanoi. Altough a 'no-frill' airline you get a lot for your money: 30 kg of luggage, small snack on board and WIFI on board the aircraft. Check-In was smooth, flight on time and aircraft brand-new. A lot of the 'old carriers' could learn something from Nok Air.

### "impressed by efficiency and service"
Chiang Mai to Bangkok. For a low cost airline, you cannot do much better as a passenger than Nok Air. This is my fourth flight in two weeks with this airline, and each time I impressed by the efficiency and service provided to passengers. Planes were all new, quite comfortable and the service, including a snack, was fine. Unlike most of the Asian low cost airlines, Nok Air does offer a nice little snack plus free baggage (15K on domestic and 30K!! on international). Check in is fast and easy and pretty painless. Compared to the market king, Air Asia, Nok Air is a much pleasanter experience, and often, cheaper too! Another bonus: in Thailand they offer free Wifi connection at their boarding areas and even on some flights.

### "service has improved"
Nok Air are still using quite old aircraft but service has improved since last time a flew with them a few years ago. It is a cheaper alternative to Bangkok Air on route to Samui. Free snack was provided that seems to be a nice gesture especially the flight took just over 50 minutes.

### "came through in an excellent way"
NOK delayed the first leg of my trip to Bangkok by one hour. That only left 30 minutes to catch the flight to Yangon. I told them I had a meeting in the morning, had a non-refundable reservation in Yangon that night and just really needed to make that flight. They came through in an excellent way. They took care of my international processing at Mae Sot. They moved me to the front of the plane in the premium seat. When I landed one of their agents picked me in a van and escorted me through all the processing including priority processing at customs. They managed to get me to the gate on time to board my original flight to Yangon. So, I got an extra hour at home to prepare and still made my original bookings. In addition I found they had free WiFi on my flight. As always their prices are great also.

### "no complaints at all"
Very impressed with Nok Air which operates from Bangkok Don Mueang. Check in was quick, they were much more relaxed about a few extra kilos and an extra carry on than European low cost airlines. The flight departed on time, and was fine - legroom was a bit tight but that's to be expected on a low-cost, friendly crew and even a little snack served. It was pouring with rain when we arrived in Mae Sot but they even provided a stand of umbrellas at the bottom of the aircraft steps to keep you dry as you walk to the little terminal. No complaints at all.

### "my last time with Nok Air"
About Nok Air I have nothing to complain about their economy service that I think is fair, but their premium seat service is a failure. Last time I paid the extra service of premium seat to receive as they offer, exclusive check in, priority boarding, special seats and priority baggage delivery. To my question where is the premium check in counter I received the answer "we not have one". To my question why no sticker for priority delivery of bag the answer was:  you no need one". When I asked why there is no priority boarding for premium the answer was: "why you didn't asked for it when we called for boarding". My final question was why we pay extra for services that we don't receive and the answer was: "You can choose another airline next time". Nothing to complain for the in flight staff that was very professional but a smile could be a nice add on to the service. This was my last time with Nok Air.

### "excellent service"
Hanoi to Bangkok with Nok Air. Excellent service from start to finish. Clean, professional, even loaded the plane from the rear to the front, so you are not waiting for the people up front to get to your seat. Lots of leg room. No in flight entertainment, but it was less than 2 hours, and even arrived early.

### "passenger service nose-dived"
I have frequently used Nok Air for flights within Thailand and have found the airline consistently good. Even after its recent problems with pilots and working hours, I took it for a recent weekend in the northeast city of Udon Thani. For whatever reason, as other posters have pointed out, standards of passenger service have nose-dived. Economy check-in for a midday flight was split between two aisles covering all the airline's flights with just 3 counters open on one and 2 on the other. Unfortunately I was in the "other" queue with about 40 passengers ahead of me. That in itself would have presented little problem, except two separate passengers had their passports locked in their suitcases! Then, despite the rule of one on-board cabin bag with a max. weight of 7kgs, 8 others in the queue had at least two largish bags. And of course, when they got to the check-in desk a lot more time was wasted opening and re- packing. All the time the check-in ladies just sat and watched. A couple of desks away was a Nok employee just playing with his movie phone. The question therefore is: realising that these problems arise and given that Nok had no less than 3 service representatives floating around that area doing precious little, why on earth were they not checking for these particular problems long before the relevant passengers were anywhere near check-in? As if that were bad enough, once on the aircraft, one man boarded with 3 sizeable pieces of luggage, one a trolley bag. With the considerable difficulty he had hoisting it into the overhead bin, that alone clearly weighed well over 7kgs. Of course low cost carriers have their rules and certain inconvenience is virtually guaranteed. But a failure to make simple checks and a failure to enforce rules just makes the experience less bearable.

### "airline service went downhill"
I was flying some month ago with Nok Air and it was quite okay, but it seams that since than the airline service went downhill. I was now booking another ticket to Bangkok - earliest flight - and was 5 days before notified per email that the flight would be changed to a later time. As I do not need a flight at later time a tried to contact their hotline and was waiting 25 minutes in the loop without anything happening. On their website you can only change flights - what I do not need. Their are flights canceled from Nok Air every Friday I fly, to me it looks like that they not get their flights filled up and simply cancel them. For me this was the last time I booked a ticket with Nok Air.

### "efficient and smiling"
Nok Air is a low cost domestic airline of Thailand but offers full service including free wifi on some aircrafts. Online booking with a foreign credit card is hassle free. Flights between DonMuang airport and Surathani were both on time. Clean aircraft, perceived onboard safety is good. Crew is attentive, efficient and smiling.

### "airline has deteriorated significantly"
This airline has deteriorated significantly over the last 12 months to the extent that its customer service is now very poor. At a peak time on a Monday late afternoon I had to wait 1 hour 45 minutes in the check-in line because Nok had less than half of their counters open (only 2 of the 6 were open). This was for my flight from Don Muang to Ubon Ratchathani. I complained about the waiting time to a senior staff member of Nok Air and his response was unbelievable. He told me if I was not happy to wait then I should fly another airline or travel another mode of transport. There have been subsequent delays on other days and cancelled flights where I was given no compensation.

### "how they perform in a crisis"
Flew Nok Air from Chiang Mai to Bangkok (having to make an international connection at Suvarnbhumi after landing at Don Muang) on Feb 16, a few days after their pilot strike. Host of problems: flight moved from 10:45am to 11:15am, aircraft changed from a single-body to wide body (airline changed to Nok Scoot), consequently took far longer to fill and far longer to load luggage, flight ultimately leaving at 12:40pm; on arrival at Don Muang the airbridge would not work and it took half an hour to disembark get onboard a bus which wound its way to the terminal, the luggage took 40 minutes to arrive. During this entire time I am biting my nails because I had to transfer from one airport to the other and the shuttle bus takes between 1-1/2 to 2 hours and I was in danger of missing my international flight. By the time I collected my luggage there was no way to make my connection at Suvarnbhumi had I used the shuttle and I had no choice but to take a taxi and tell the driver if he made it in 35 minutes I would give him 1000B. He did, and I made it with 10 minutes to spare before the check in counter closed. My return to Chiang Mai (Bkk-CM) is for March 4 at 19:00. I found out yesterday, February 25, that all Nok flights in March leaving Bangkok after 17:00 have been cancelled. Since my incoming flight to Suvarnbhumi comes in at 15:00 there is no way for me to make an earlier flight. All efforts to contact Nok by email have resulted in no reply. Calling Nok from India (where I am now) results in being put on endless hold and it costs about 19B a minute. Have used Nok 6-8 times a year, for more then 10 years, on this route and have rarely found any fault. However, the proof of an airline's worth is how they perform in a crisis - in this case some of their pilots being on strike - and here Nok fails miserably. I finally ended up buying a ticket on another airline and at more than twice the cost. I would, however, continue to recommend this airline. Hope the next time they have a crisis they perform better.

### "I was disappointed"
Flew Nok Air from Phuket to Bangkok. No priority at all. This time I was disapointed. I tried for the first time their premium seats. As from the banner to their web site they offer priority check in, boarding and baggage. In Phuket airport no special counter for premium. No priority boarding at all. Seat was ok with enough leg room. Aircraft as usual dirty outside but clean inside. Nice and gentle staff inflight but its true that they do not smile anymore as once upon a time. Snack improved. Extra coffee or tea as premium. No priority baggage at all. I took my bag last after 40 mins. Nice surprise the Wi-Fi. Recommend? Yes for the leg room in premium seats (if to the first row or next to emergency exit) and Wi-Fi. No for the rest.

### "best low cost I have used"
Bangkok to Chiang Mai with Nok Air and very impressed. Definitely the best low cost I have used : 15kg luggage allowance, boarding and departure in advance as all passengers were in, brand new plane, free snack onboard and free wifi (I am making this review as we just started our descent).

### "Well done Nok Air"
Flew Nok Air from Bangkok to Sura Thani and all good. On time, pleasant crew, comfortable seats and very clean. Short flight, so snacks handed out and no entertainment (less than a 1 hour flight). Where Nok Air really shone was on the flight back to Bangkok. Inbound plane delayed, and our daughter had a connecting flight out of BKK. Service staff at Sura Thani asked about connecting flights, and when she was informed of the tight connection time, she flew into action, retrieved the checked bag, had it prioritized and changed our seats to the first row. When we landed, a NOK Air agent was literally waiting outside the cabin door. Took our daughter, retrieved the bag (never seen someone run in high heels) and whisked her out to a cab. Total time from the plane door opening to getting into the cab - 11 minutes! Well done Nok Air.

### "first negative experience"
My first bad experience. Was scheduled to travel Nok Air November 26 at 7pm - their last flight of the day - from Bangkok to Chiang Mai. Was informed by email on November 25th that my flight, owing to airport restrictions in Chiang Mai because of the Loy Krathong festival, had been moved to 17:50, As I was coming in to Suvarnbhumi at 15:00 from India, this did not leave me enough time to make the 17:50 flight from Don Muang. Nok Air, in their email to me offered to change without charge to any other flight of that day or any other day or a full refund. I emailed explaining I was coming in from India and asking for advice as to whether Nok would pay for an overnight stay. Four emails got no response from Nok Air. I finally had to call them twice from India, at a cost of more than 300 baht, in order to reschedule a flight for the next day. Nok Air made no offer to compensate either for the calls or an overnight stay. I have travelled on their planes many times and this is my first negative experience.

### "packs a lot in their offering"
First tine trying Nok Air. As a budget airline, Nok Air packs a lot in their offering. Online booking was easy and crystal clear. Check in was smooth and orderly. Paid extra for exit row premier seat. I was pleasantly surprised by the provision of priority boarding. Onboard service smooth, FA all speak reasonably good English, was offered a small snack bag which includes a cup of water. WiFi is free of charge. Not that you need it for flights lasting less than an hour. No tv or entertainment but doesn't matter for short flight. They are excellent option for Thailand domestic flights. I read that they're gradually expanding their reach to Singapore and Taiwan. It's worth considering.

### "not a patch on AirAsia"
First time on Nok Air as normally take Airasia for domestic travel in Thailand. Check-in was nightmare, as they did not have my pre-reserved seat in the emergency exit and tried to charge me 300THB - despite the fact I already paid this. Boarding from a remote stand through buses unlike other airline using an airbridge. Aircraft was tired, an ex Ryanair Boeing 737. Seat was uncomfortable and not a patch on AirAsia. You do get a complimentary cup cake as a snack. I will be using AirAsia for future domestic travel in Thailand.

### "would use NOK air again"
Booking with Nok air was simple and easy. Got a confirmed flight and at a great price. Checking in at Khon Kaen Airport was different as I know it is a tiny airport but was easy and swift. Overall the flight was fast and simple. Yes it is a budget airline but at least they gave you a small snack and water and the option to purchase food as well. Plane was clean and tidy and the staff very friendly. 55 mins and was in BKK. Duration from check in to landing around 2 Hours. By bus it would have been 6.5 hours. So would use NOK air again for sure.

### "really liked the service "
Surat Thani to Bangkok with Nok Air, and I really liked the service provided by this company, the value for money and the nice set of planes. Moreover, in a very short flight they still served a great snack.

### "we loved Nok Air"
Chiang Mai to Bangkok and an outstanding experiance with Nok Air. Beside the price (which is extremely affordable) we loved everything. They have priority boarding for families. Even though it is a low cost airline, you got a free snack on board (we got muffin) and water. This is the only airline we flew with free wi-fi on the plane and we could check e-mails during the flight. The crew was excellent, very friendly. Kids also loved it, because their planes are colored as birds. We loved Nok Air and will use them when we are in Thailand.

### "the crew didn't look happy"
My first time with Nok Air from Bangkok to Phuket. The flight took off and landed on time. Legroom was fine. My seat was dirty and not cleaned from the previous flight. The food they hand out isn't special but I didn't expect anything for a one hour flight so I can't complain. The crew didn't look happy and were unfriendly, something I haven't experienced before on a Thai airline. I couldn't understand what they said during the announcements. = It seemed like even they weren't very eager to be on that flight. It was my first and probably last experience on this airline.

### "not much different to full-service airline"
Bangkok Don Muang to Phuket, and was surprised by Nok Air. Despite being a low-cost airline, their services are not much different from a full-service airline : 15 kg free baggage, free seat selection and even snacks - something I never expect when flying cheap. Both onward and return trips were punctual. However, the in-flight magazine is all in Thai. I know that was domestic flight but not every passenger is Thai so they should prepare bilingual magazines.

### "cabin was filthy"
Nok Air flight from Bangkok Don Muang to Phitsanulok was over an hour late, and no apology from ground crew. The cabin was filthy, broken seats. AirAsia rates better than this airline.

### Nok Air customer review
Bangkok Don Muang-Ubon Ratchathani round trip. No delays, no cancels. The price included 15kg free checked baggage and free snacks. The seats not too comfortable, than on most low-cost airlines but no problem for a 55 minutes long route.

### Nok Air customer review
Phuket to Bangkok Don Mueng. Aircraft old and not so clean. A snack and water is offered with no option to choose between coffee, coke or a juice. 15 kgs free, no delay, staff as always professional and price little more expensive than Lion Air and cheaper than Air Asia. Impossible manage your booking (via web site) if book from an agency but is possible to check in 24 hours before departure. If book from an agency will cost you 200 bahts extra but they have the possibility to choose the seat for you right away.

### Nok Air customer review
BKK-CNX return. Found them to be adequate and efficient low cost airlines. Fleet of 737-800 range from so old to brand new all with passable seat pitch. Snack served on board are edible but their asset is great hospitality rendered from staff who were very helpful from first step of check in. Punctuality is fine too.

### Nok Air customer review
Fly and drive deal from DMK-KOP and then minibus to Mukdahan. Flight on time small snack served new 737 and legroom fine. I'm 6'1. Picked up straight away at Nakhon Phanom and taken directly to our hotel. 15K luggage each for free unlike AirAsia. Nok Air far superior.

### Nok Air customer review
Bangkok to Chiang Mai return. 747-800 both legs. Comfortable enough seats and flight was spot on time. First time I have flown on Nok and I thought it was very good value for money. The only minor points to mention were the bus to and from the plane at when departing from and arriving at Don Muaeng yet so many airbridges were available. So this is a mystery to me. Also the cabin staff making announcements (and pilots too!) need to remember to speak their English announcements slower much of their announcements were incomprehensible because they try to speak too fast and mis-pronounce many words yet some "lower ranking staff" onboard spoke excellent English surely it is best to have the most competent English speaker make the announcements.

### Nok Air customer review
HKT-DMK 29 Dec B737-800. I used to be a big fan of Nok but in the past year have been disappointed. Check-in at HKT was the usual disorganized mess without appropriate lines. Agents were not polite which is unusual for Thailand. Gate boarding was the usual chaos and crowding without enforcement of the carry on rules. Flight left on time and landed on time perhaps because this was an off peak hour flight. Landing into DMK was not reassuring with unusual landing bounce and hard braking. (weather conditions excellent). The obligatory crowded bus ride to the terminal was not fun. Although I was on a full fare ticket I was grateful I did not have the preferred seats because the screaming children were seated right behind the preferred seat section. Not very thoughtful of the airline to place small kids in that zone. People pay for preferred seats to avoid the noise. I don't know why Nok provides a "snack" consisting of a hotdog roll and plastic cup of water. Most people seem to toss it and it is wasteful. Announcements from the flight deck were inaudible and in fractured English so it was a wasted effort. Seat comfort was fine and leg room was as good as any mainliner. My experience with Nok is that the travel experience is superior to Air Asia it's main competitor on the route and much better than Thai Smile. Nok offers a much better fare most days. Baggage delivery at DMK took approx. 30 minutes which never used to happen as the bags would often be unloading within 10-15 minutes. For a short commuter flight Nok is fine. However the quality of service seems to have fallen off over the past year and management needs to get out and provide some coaching/encouragement to its personnel.

### Nok Air customer review
UBP-DMK on B737. If you like Ryan Air you'll love Nok Air. they've simply taken old Ryan Air planes put on a little smile and you have a new low cost carrier. 16 of their 18 planes are old Ryanair planes with absolutely no leg room all beat up and tired and this was one of them. The equivalent of putting lipstick on a pig and it just doesn't work. This airline is thoroughly second or third class.

### Nok Air customer review
DMK-UBP in economy. I travel frequently between Bangkok and Ubon and have used all three carriers on the route. Have found Nok to have the most frequent service however ran into a serious problem with their mobile website functionality which wouldn't allow me to pre-purchase additional luggage before the flight during online check-in. This limitation then 'forced' me to purchase the additional baggage at airport which was priced ten times higher than the online rate (I paid 1200 baht vs 150 baht online). Absolutely no sympathy from surly unfriendly Nok staff the 'all smiles' airline. They told me I should've known and bought the baggage at ticket purchase. This is preposterous as I bought the ticket two months prior and had no idea how much luggage I would have. I don't mind paying a premium but absolutely resent the idea of being extorted into paying a premium due to their own website lack of functionality. Given the frequency of my travel on Nok I would've expected them to be more reasonable and understanding but there is a complete lack of commercial sensibility with the employees basically suggesting that I'm a fool. I am a fool for choosing Nok and would recommend Air Asia or Thai Air on the route unless you like to be taken advantage of humiliated and extorted by draconian policies extortion pricing and rude employees. Their employees all explained this away as Nok being a 'low cost carrier' which is a spurious explanation as the high cost of baggage makes them a 'high price / low service' carrier and other 'low cost carriers' such as AirAsia and Jetstar allow you to buy additional baggage online during check in Nok Air does not.

### Nok Air customer review
As per my previous reviews booked 2 flights Bangkok to Buriram in October. First flight cancelled with minimal notice - was emailed 8 hours in advance but did not see and arrived Don Meaung with option to go via Ubon or get money back at later date and make own way there. Chose Ubon option with a handful of other passengers but Nok did the bear minimum of point to point transfer so people were being dropped off in Buriram airport with no public transport and 35km from town 3.5 hours later than due. We ended up taking another passenger to town in our car as a courtesy to him not the airline as he would have been stranded. Return flight learned lesson and checked email evening before. Flight brought forward 2 hours with no explanation. No contact on issues other than email so if not had checked would have missed flight. Catching a flight on Thai Air Asia (on time) from Don Meaung to Chiang Mai later that evening all 7 Nok Air flights departing i noticed had various delays from 20 minutes to 65 minutes. Next time I'll choose Nokchanair bus instead for the journey it may look a lot longer timewise but often in reality now isn't.

### Nok Air customer review
Flew Chiang Mai-Bangkok (Don Muang). A pleasant experience which is usually the case with NokAir. Smooth check-in smooth walk to aircraft smooth flight smooth staff. Catnapped for the hour-long flight. People have been writing adverse comments re transfers to Suvarnabhumi and vice versa. I have done this innumerable times and found it comfortable and hassle-free and have never been stuck in traffic in Bangkok.

### Nok Air customer review
Bangkok Don Muang to Udon Thani return 30 Oct 2 Nov. iPhone app didn't work so had to use phone booking which was OK. Check in easy but 30 minute delay outward and 20 minute delay return - various excuses given. Nice clean planes and pleasant service. All in all a very good service but would use Suvarnabhumi next time.

### Nok Air customer review
DD7217 31 May B737-800 (Winglets and leased from Air Berlin) Surat Thani (URT) - Bangkok (DMK). Check-in a breeze staff however have to get on with the world and make an attempt to learn the English language. Boarding was by the Step Ladder organised people seated from the forward to mid zone were showed to the forward door and people seated mid zone to the back were shown to the rear door. Immediately on takeoff there was a medical emergency and the crew acted in a prompt and efficient manner announced for a doctor on board and had things under control. after the emergency was settled the crew even made notes as sequence of events so s not to forget while reporting I guess. Snack served to all pax was a large Sweet Cookie and water. Cannot ask for anything more for the price they charge.

### Nok Air customer review
Perfectly acceptable service great prices snacks in-flight included with option to buy other items. Easy online booking system. No inflight entertainment but unnecessary for a short flight. Nok outclasses Air Asia for example. DMK to Chiang Rai. Don Muaung is a great airport to access and negotiate.

### Nok Air customer review
DD7507 23 Feb HKT-DMK B737-800 (Leased from Ryanair). HKT airport only 2 check-in counters for this flight (1 not operational) girl sitting on the inoperative counter busy applying make-up. Poor girl on the working counter struggling hard to complete check-in for all the 150 odd pax. Again inflight crew great but again Inflight safety demonstration only in THAI. Legroom is very poor the guy in front reclined what he could his seat was straight in my knees. Great for a short hop of 1 hour or so but never for a longer flight.

### Nok Air customer review
DD7502 21 Feb DMK-HKT (B738 leased from Ryanair). Ground staff level of English is so poor that I had to draw a window to explain I wanted a window seat. Cabin crew very warm and delightful bunch of girls. Safety demonstration only in THAI (not English) considering more than 70% of the flight were foreigners. Snack served was a cold micro mini sized stuffed bun and 1 cup of water good enough for a Low cost airline. They should play some soft spa type instrumental music considering Thailand is so rich in it's music and culture.

### Nok Air customer review
Flew Bangkok-Chiang Rai-Bangkok last month. Cheap and cheerful sums it up. Website easy to use. Even got a free drink and cake inflight. Don Muang not busy so quick check in and no queues at security. Why pay much more to fly with Thai unless of course you are connecting at Suvarnabhumi in which case TG would make sense as the transfer from BKK to DMK can be tricky and time consuming.

### Nok Air customer review
3 flights over Christmas/New Year between Bangkok and Buriram all had problems. Nok Air have increased their frequency to daily on this route but as a result have over stretched themselves if any issues occur. Flight 1 - originally booked for 23/12 emailed 3 days before to say flight was cancelled due to weather forecast but managed to get rebooked on to next day flight instead. However flight was full and found last row of seats in saab plane has reduced legroom so not happy. 2/1 - Buriram to Bangkok. Flight due to take off at 3.30 took off 5pm. No information provided about delay to any passengers from Nok air staff about delay or when incoming aircraft likely to arrive - dependant on information on internet instead. Buriram - Bangkok 5/1 worst of the 3. No information about issues until arrive at airport. Told flight cancelled - after much arguing between all passengers and staff offered alternative of flight to Ubon and then minibus back to Buriram with cost of ticket refunded. Originally scheduled to arrive 3.10 arrived Buriram at 11pm instead. Very disappointed with Nok Air this trip not only with issues but with lack of honesty about cause and information on delays being provided in an accurate manner. The issues have arisen due to one of the leased aircraft developing a major fault causing numerous cancellations and knock-on delays but would like to have been told this. Being a big supporter of Nok Air previously I am disappointed by this. Hope they get back to previous standard in future as this is the only flight option to Buriram.

### Nok Air customer review
Bangkok to Nahkon Si Thammarat RT. Nok is a wonderful LCC that has justifiably built up a loyal customer base. As a Nok Club member I receive an extra 5k allowance which is one of the airline's best deals. Yes the seat pitch is tight but is no worse than many western legacy airlines. The plane was clean and sufficiently staffed by FAs There is no inflight entertainment and no shared map. Nok provides a small snack and a pre-packaged cup of water. It's a nice gesture but many people decline the snack as it is usually a pastry with some sort of processed sausage or luncheon type meat. Baggage service was good. My only concern was that the safety instructions were exclusively in Thai and the English spoken was incomprehensible. Appreciably Nok is a Thai airline but it does carry non Thai pax The airline could easily record a proper English safety announcement and just play it as is the case with other airlines that service multi language clients. I consider Nok to be the best LCC in Thailand and its pricing is transparent.

### Nok Air customer review
Bangkok - Chiang Rai - Bangkok. Booked online. Check in was fast and easy. Checked one bag was not charged both ways. Snack was simple and tasty. Seat tip get exit row (44-45) - lots of leg room.

### Nok Air customer review
Online booking and check-in easy to use. Don Muang to Chiang Rai and return on B737-800. Only economy option. No inflight entertainment but soft drinks and small snack served for free. There was an option to purchase other foodstuffs and drinks from the trolley. Quick check-in and luggage collection at both ends. Please note that when booking online you must de-select extra luggage and insurance or these will be charged for. Free 15kgs luggage included. If your trip might involve changes to your itinerary it's well worth paying a few extra baht to buy a flexi ticket. Otherwise you have to buy a new ticket in most cases. On landing you receive a text message thanking you for flying with them and asking you to report any problems or concerns with their service! Certainly we had no such concerns. Cheaper than Thai Air Asia and much cheaper than Thai.

### Nok Air customer review
BFV-DMK. One of three flights a week on a 36 seater Saab from Buriram to Don Muang. No queue for check-in due to very few people in the airport. Slightly dubious the luggage scales were correct given a subsequent Air Asia flight and had to pay 400 bht for a couple of kilos extra luggage - not a big deal given the price of the flights booked (1100 bht all in) but disappointing none the less in hindsight. Other than that an excellent value for money flight which arrived early and had the usual free snack and water provided during the 40 mins in the air. No inflight entertainment on this size plane but not an issue for the short hop. will be using again over Christmas already having booked the same promo fare.

### Nok Air customer review
I was unfortunate enough to be going from Don Muang to Roi-et on the evening flight of 20th February. Received an email stating it would be leaving at 6.15pm rather than 5.50pm but on arrival at the airport it had been changed again to 6.35 pm. 6.35pm came and went no information whatsoever from any Nok air employees eventually at 7.05pm we were called took of at 7.10 approximately and arrived at Roi-et at 8.20pm more than 75 minutes late and yet no apology from any Nok Air staff. Whether this was a one off bad experience I'll wait to find out if things improve then I'll only be too glad to report it but customer relations need some improvement based on Wednesdays ordeal. The person waiting for me in Roi-et asked why the plane was so late Nok Air staff in Roi-et did not know.

### Nok Air customer review
21.1.2013. Bangkok-Chumphon flight DD7614 seat 2a. Booked online in November and knew I would be over the 15kg baggage allowance but web page said excess charges were 50bht per kilo so wasn't too bothered about the excess weight I would be carrying with my diving equipment in my luggage. At check in my bag weighed 26kg I had pre-paid for 20kg on the booking so was expecting to pay a reasonable 300bht excess. The check in person said I must pay 200bht per kilo - 1200bht. He then became rude and said if I didn't pay the new charge my bag would not be carried. Apart from this issue the flight was good but noisy on a small Saab aircraft but connected with the Lompraya ferry service well.

### Nok Air customer review
Udonthani to DMK. 31/1/2013. Took this option as it was offered with connections by ferry from Koh Tao on a joint ticket. The Lompraya service was slightly delayed but the bus got us to the airport with 10 minutes to spare before departure. We were whisked through check-in and the plane took off just 10 minutes late. A very good effort by both Lompraya and Nok Air. Plane was 20 year old ex Turkish airlines 737-400 acceptable for this short flight and must be popular as it was full. good value especially with the ferry connection and reasonable extra weight charges but only if you pre pay. Charges at the airport are 4 times more.

### Nok Air customer review
DMK to Udonthani. Nok Air now using Bangkok's Don Muang Airport which is a breeze and close to the city. Cheapest fares going online booking simple to use. Self-check-in available. Clean on-time flights free snack and drink onboard. Luggage allowance only 15kgs but cheap excess charges. Less than a third of the Thai Airways price and cheaper than Air Asia too!

### Nok Air customer review
Bangkok-Chiang Mai-Bangkok. Great experience from the on-line booking experience through to the flights themselves which were smooth and on time. Excellent friendly staff both on the ground and in the air with a free snack and a drink. Both planes clean and tidy. Worth buying flexible tickets which even give you 5kg extra weight allowance for your baggage. Overall a very positive and enjoyable experience - if only European 'low cost' airlines could offer a similar product and service.

### Nok Air customer review
Bangkok - Chiang Mai and Chiang Rai - Bangkok - Nothing negative to say about Nok. Check in was easy flights were on time and the in-air service was good. I had booked these flights from the US months ahead of time but everything was in the system and we had no problems whatsoever. I anticipated issues with luggage due to past problems with discount carriers but this was unjustified with Nok. Considering the low cost of the flights there is no reason not to fly Nok. The service greatly exceeds that of full-fare US airlines these days.

### Nok Air customer review
Chiang Mai-Mae Hong Son return. Not much to say about a 35 min flight (25 min in the air) in a SAAB 340. Nice view during the flight. Landed on time. Short flight but got a kind of a pizzasandwich and a cup of water nice. The day before the returning flight the airline cancelled our flight and we have to choose of two departures before or after our origin flight.

### Nok Air customer review
DMK to CEI and back 6 days later. Schedule changed after booking but was informed by email and given different options. Check in and boarding quick and organised. Planes clean and in good shape. Free snack and water. Smiles all over and on time arrivals. What would you want more?

### Nok Air customer review
Bangkok to Chiang Mai return to Bangkok. Flights on time pilots and flight attendants were excellent. On both flights a nice snack was served with a cup of water and other drinks as well. Seats were comfortable for coach and seemed to be slightly larger than some other airlines. Overall excellent experience.

### Nok Air customer review
Bangkok to Phuket return as normal with this airline. Flights on time and excellent service at check in and during flight. Good snack and quick baggage return at both ends. I would say to anyone travelling in Thailand if Nok Air fly the route then fly them. Seat selection and luggage allowance (15 kilo) free and fares are nearly always the best.

### Nok Air customer review
Ubon Ratchathani to Bangkok on B737 Service on ground and in air superb. Luggage a kilo or so ove but no problem. A bun sort of thing with sausage and water served in flight luggage waiting for me at Don Muang. I had more legroom on this plane than on my Thai flight on A330 from Australia. Recommend Nok Air to all.

### Nok Air customer review
Don Muang-Chiang Mai-Don Muang flown on an old Thai Airways B73700. However flights were on time. Free seat selection and they served some free snacks with water. Additional drinks were sold at low prices. NOK offered the lowest fares between Bangkok and Chiang Mai. The only negative aspect of this flight were the cabin crew who did not seem very happy to work.

Chiang Mai to Dom Muang (Bangkok). Cheap flight 1200baht on way. Cheaper than Air Asia with all their 1 way pick seat and baggage add ons! Flight comfortable on time and well priced. Aircraft an old 737 but clean and comfortable. Food and water supplied for free and FA's happy and helpful.

### Nok Air customer review
Chiang Mai to Bangkok. Good flight on time comfortable enough and a free feed for 1500 thai baht or 30 pounds sterling for two people. That's cheaper than Airasia if you don't mind going to Don Muang! Overall very good.

### Nok Air customer review
DMK-Trang economy - very satisfied with this flight. Check-in boarding and departure was on time. Our baggage exceeded allowance ad we had to pay extra but they charged only 50 Bahts per kilo. Airplane was not new but clean and well maintained. Cabin crew very friendly. Surprisingly there was even small but warm pizza provided free of charge during the flight. The price was not as low as for Air Asia flights but still acceptable.

### Nok Air customer review
NST-DMK booked Nok plus for extra legroom and extra baggage allowance - extra money worth paying. Inside of plane was certainly not sparkling new it was clear it is a leased TG plane but looked well kept anyway. Nok plus passengers seat in the front cabin which is treated just a business class divided from the back of plane by a curtain and with large seats with configuration 2-2 instead of 3-3. Ordered (and paid) for some food - astonished however to have fresh and tastiest plane food since years. Nok Air give much more attention to detail with tray and small snack included in price apart the food I paid extra. Good and fast check in at NST fast boarding flight on time appreciated returning to old DMK Don Mueang where we got the baggage in a fraction of time we would have waited at the horrendous and chaotic BKK. Plane clean good service newspaper offered very good experience - is Nok Air really to be considered a low cost?

### Nok Air customer review
HKT-DMK on 737-400. Slow check-in at HKT. Late gate change at HKT caused confusion and boarding chaotic. Onboard cramped seating conditions. Served a horrible sausage pretzel and a cup of water. Don euang airport in Bangkok easy to use - aircraft to taxi in less than 200 metres/10 minutes including baggage reclaim. I wouldn't use them again.

### Nok Air customer review
Udon Thani to DMK. Flight was on time. The seat is comfortable and there was a snack service in flight. I think that snack is the bread that they can't use anymore in Auntie Anne. However the baggage arrived fast and the ticket price is not expensive. The in-flight service is better than Air Asia but Nok Air is more expensive and more comfortable.

### Nok Air customer review
Don M to Chiang Mai round trip and Don M to UTH several times. Their website is quite easy to negotiate and prices were comparable to their primary competitor on those routes Air Asia. Nok Plus is well worth the small difference in price and I had good service on clean planes with beverages and snacks provided. Twice upon arrival at UTH it was raining and their ground was outside handing out umbrellas since they put you on the tarmac not a jetway. They would be my first choice of the SE Asia bargain airlines.

Bangkok-Chiangmai on a cramped ex-Thai Airways B737-400. A budget airline that gets you from A to B. Don't talk about service or comfort of any kind. Internet booking efficient. Seat numbers allotted at check-in.

Pleased with the product although on one leg they charged us excess baggage and on another they did not. The staff were very nice and polite. Drinks etc although had to be bought were a reasonable price. No problems.

DMK-KBV. The trip with NokAir was an enjoyable experience. Ground and air staff were very friendly. The flight was on time. The airplane although not being new seemed to be well maintained. We even got the emergency exit seats we asked for. What could you ask more for under 20 Euros?
