### "a couple of bags overweight"
Not Verified |  I had some bags that were a couple of bags overweight. They wanted to charge me about 1200 aed which is equivalent to 450 USD for bringing 12 kg of extra weight over four bags. Their manager asked me to buy another bag and then they would only charge me 340 aed. So I bought another bag for 330 aed, and when I came back to the counter after rearranging all my belongings the manager and guy at the counter said that I have to pay 740 aed more. Imagine bringing 12 extra kg of weight over 4 bags and having to pay about 1070 aed more just for your belongings. This is by far one of the worst airline experiences I’ve ever had. Etihad policies are beyond unreasonable. Their supervisors are unhelpful. Their economy seats are even worse, as they give you no leg room. I won’t ever be flying Etihad again, and would recommend everyone around me not to either.

### "consistency in service and comfort"
I was booked from Singapore to London and flew on an A380 from Abu Dhabi to London. Singapore to Abu Dhabi was a red-eye flight and Abu Dhabi to London, daylight. I have always enjoyed flying on the A380s and have been able to secure forward-facing window seats, with extra storage on the side of the seat. The upper deck is for business and first class passengers. The first leg began with welcome drinks and hot towels. Although dine-on-demand is available, I think the cabin crew were keen to expect everyone to dine simultaneously. A thin soft mattress, large pillow, blanket and slippers are all provided. Seat functions, from flat-bed to seat firmness and other options are easy to control. The amenity kit is basic, nothing special. The menu offers a good selection of starters, main courses and desserts. Following a tender braised beef with sweet potato mash for the main course for dinner, I moved to the onboard lounge for a coffee and cognac. The small lounge can seat up to 6 passengers and has a self-service bar. The second leg began from the Etihad Business Lounge in Abu Dhabi, where you can board some flights directly from the lounge. One of the things I do enjoy flying with Etihad is their tasty meals and dining. The list of alcoholic drinks is not extensive, but they are mostly premium brands. Prior to lunch, I was treated to a White Negroni cocktail (Campari, gin and dry vermouth). For the main course, Lamb Shank with rice was one of the most delicious onboard meals I've had. While the IFE features a good selection of entertainment, my regular complaint has been the lack of new movies, as it seems to keep repeating the same old films (since I last flew with them about four months ago). Settling to watch some TV shows and documentaries, and cabin crew spoiling me with more drinks and snacks, it was an enjoyable cruise all the way to London. I have had minor criticisms in the past, and a few negative views on privacy and service on their Dreamliner, and when flying Economy. Yet in my experience, travelling in Business Class, I have come to appreciate Etihad's general standard of consistency in service and comfort. And on this trip, two great A380s in one journey felt like having two for the price of one!

### "customer service was worse than useless"
Not Verified |  Our flight was from Barcelona to Abu Dhabi, then to Kuala Lumpur and then on to Da Nang. The flights to Kuala Lumpur were fine, a tad stingy on the food and drink, but reasonably comfortable. The major problem occurred when I was denied boarding by Etihad Airwys' partner airline Batik Air in Kuala Lumpur. The reason given was that I needed a visa to enter Vietnam. I had previously checked and double checked and knew that I did not need a visa. I showed the staff at the boarding gate proof that I did not need a visa, but they did not let me board the flight. I then organised an online visa at a cost of over 300 USD but was too late to board. At that point I was left on my own. I was told to book another flight. I had to go through immigration in Kuala Lumpur which thanks to some very helpful officials was very easy. The only route I was able to find at short notice was a flight to Ho Chi Minh city and then from there a flight to Da Nang. Malaysia Airlines asked for no evidence of a visa for my flight to Ho Chi Minh city and when I arrived there I was told I did not need a visa to enter Vietnam and was given the standard 45 days entry stamp in my passport. I then booked a flight to Da Nang and arrived eight hours later than planned after a very stressful day through no fault of mine and with an extra cost of approximately 800 euros. Etihad Airways customer service was worse than useless. The person I spoke to had two phrases in his repertoire: "I am sorry sir, I cannot help you with that sir" and " I am sorry sir, I am not authorised to deal with that sir". I emailed Etihad Airways and received a standard reply that they were very busy and might reply to me within 28 days. If not I could contact them again! On my return to Spain I telephoned customer service again to be told that they could not be held responsible for visa problems. Pointing out to them that the problem was theirs not mine was like banging my head against a brick wall. After various emails it now seems that Etihad Airways are "looking into the matter". What that really means I have no idea. Time will tell.

### "left me quite dissatisfied"
Despite the 5 hours duration of the flight, no proper meal was provided, only a small sandwich, which was quite insufficient. Additionally, one of the toilets onboard was out of service, leading to long queues and inconvenience throughout the flight. I chose to fly with Etihad expecting a comfortable and premium experience, not one akin to a low-cost carrier. This experience has left me quite dissatisfied and questioning my future travel choices.

### "I expected better"
I never imagined that flying with Etihad Airways  would result in such an emotionally exhausting and unjust experience. My checked baggage, weighing 11kg, was completely lost. After repeated follow-ups and weeks of silence, I was told I would be compensated USD 297, based on $27 per kilogram. To make matters worse, I was shocked to see that on the WorldTracer system, my baggage was falsely marked as “found.” I have never received my bag. This false status now prevents me from pursuing my case further. The airline insisted on original purchase receipts for compensation, which is not a requirement under UAE law for the statutory compensation per kilogram of lost baggage. They then told me the case was “closed,” without properly addressing these points or correcting the false baggage status. There was no empathy, no legal fairness, and no real effort to resolve the issue. If you’re flying Etihad, be warned: if something goes wrong, you may be on your own — even if you know your rights and try to pursue them. I expected better.

### "Etihad has cut down their service"
I flew from Toronto to Colombo  via AUH. It's a long 14 hr flight. Flight was a new A350. Very comfortable. Service is terrible, food portions are very small and choices are available are all Indian food. No other options available. Only chicken or veg are the two options. After the dinner service no mid flight snack available. Only available option for snack is 4 small Oreo cookies. No water service, have to go to galley and get your water if you need water. Etihad has cut down their service and I felt like I flew on a north American carrier, not a middle eastern carrier. You cannot compare with Emirates or Qatar anymore.

### "A very disengaged attitude"
Not Verified |  Return to BKK - Business Class flights both on time. Ground crew have the customer care skills second to a Military sergeant, rude, disengaged and flippant. Seats requested were honored. Plane was clean and was quite smooth. Food below expectations, menus are now clearly on the cost cutting plan. Soup / Chicken thighs and ice cream or cheese. Wines like others have mentioned are low quality. Champagne is worth avoiding and not palatable. Last but not least the cabin Crew obviously do the very basics are not proactive and had to be called each time. Too busy sitting and chatting in the galley than ensuring any passenger may want something. A very disengaged attitude and lacked any polish or personal engagement skills. Robotic

### "customer service was extremely poor"
The customer service was extremely poor. They charged me for a stopover and booked a hotel near the airport without informing me that a transit visa was required to reach it. Even the hotel booking confirmation email lacked this crucial detail. Since it was our first time traveling through Abu Dhabi Airport, we assumed the hotel was inside the airport. The response from the Etihad booking team was terrible, and their service was disappointing. Essentially, they charge you for the stopover, book the ticket, and then mark you as a no-show at the hotel, ultimately scamming you.

### “staff were excellent”
Please note booking was made directly with Etihad. Trip started great with a visit to Etihad's excellent lounge at Term 4 at LHR. It became time for boarding and it was clear the flight was going to be delayed. Etihad ground staff did their best to keep us informed and they had a large number of staff at the gate to answer questions. We were assured that any missed connections would be dealt with in AUH and we departed about 2 hours late. The A380 is as always an excellent plane and the seat and staff were to match on this flight. Etihad offers dine on demand and I opted for a sandwich prior to landing in order to get some sleep. I did connection to the wifi prior to getting some rest and about 45 minutes after take off I received an email stating I had been rebooked to a later flight from AUH to BKK. I was able to accept the rebooking and get my boarding pass within an hour of taking off from LHR. The seat is excellent both for sitting/lounging and sleeping. Staff were on the ball and offered me food as soon as I woke up. At AUH ground staff were waiting for us with a number of counters set up with pre-printed boarding cards for passengers with missed connections. All you had to do was go to the right counter and get your onwards boarding card. I skipped all that and went straight to the impressive business class lounge at AUH and spent a few hours there before my connecting flight. A B777 took me the last leg to BKK. The seat consistency Etihad has across their wide body fleet is impressive and gives a familiar feel regardless of the aircraft type. Once again staff were excellent. The only downside I could find on this flight was they have cut the pre-landing snack service, but the flight is relatively short so not a massive issue. Overall a very enjoyable flight despite arriving at my destination about 4 hours later than expected, but I wish all airlines would handle delays that well, big praise to Etihad on this one. The only place they have fallen down a bit is they have not proactively offered me compensation as I am intitled to and finding that on their website is not straight forward, however once the process is started it is very quick and easy.

### "disgusting level of customer service"
The entire flight there was no wifi and the staff took turns informing us it would start in a few minutes, until one staff finally admitted there would be no wifi due to technical issues. The staff were nice but did not know their job. The shower was also not working and no one bothered to inform the premium first-class passengers. The lesser said of their IFE, the better. They are proud to keep 6-7 games. The icing on the cake comes from the disgusting level of customer service which Etihad is now gaining laurels for. First-class service involves much more precision than serving caviar and with this level of customer service, get ready for the decline of Etihad.

### "still waiting for compensation"
Not Verified |  Our Family holiday to from Heathrow to the Maldives via Abu Dhabi. The plane departure from Heathrow was delayed by a couple of hours. It was a long flight the the entertainment systems was not working. Then from Abu Dhabi there was a 15hr delay. Eventually got to the resort a day late. Not great experience and still waiting for compensation from Etihad after 6 months.

### "asked to pay £200 for my suitcase"
Not Verified |  I did not pay attention that my ticket did not include a suitcase, at check in I was asked to pay £200 for my suitcase of 7 Kg. Airlines are good at sending their customers to the competition. Wont see me ever again.

### "far behind Emirates and Qatar Airways!
We had two flights with Etihad last week. Phuket - Abu Dhabi - Dublin. The first flight was an hour late to take off. I mean after everyone was onboard and everything seemed ready, we still waited almost an hour to take off. In both flights, the staff looked and spoke to people as if they were doing us a favor. Beef option offered, minced meat given. Very cheap for a company that sell themselves as a premium airline. And it was a flight from Thailand, where minced beef is not even a common thing in their culinary. The only positive thing I can say about the flights was the comfortable seat recline. But overall, they are far behind Emirates and Qatar Airways service quality. That’s for sure!

### "the plane was overbooked"
Flying from Pakistan to Denmark. Not able to continue my travel from Abu Dhabi because the plane was overbooked. Customer service is out the window. They’re not following rules and regulation. The regulation for compensation is actually on their own webpage, but they are not following them. Now I’m lying in bed at an airport hotel with three meal vouchers and waiting 24 hours to continue my journey. And the compensation is a $300 voucher that can only be used for transportation within Etihad Airways. It feels like a joke when you receive a voucher. I couldn’t believe my eyes. Normally I travel Qatar/Emirates when I’m travelling in this region. This is just a reminder why?

### "Cabin crew were terrible"
Not Verified |  Tickets were bought at a great price. Outbound and return flights were on time and arrived at destination early. Seat was OK, we were in the rear of the aircraft, so reclined further than normal. Food was tolerable (it's Economy). Cabin crew were terrible, not one smile, grudging service - requests for water were ignored. One male FA in particular was bordering on hostile. I'd fly Etihad again, if I had to.

### “Never use them again"
Not Verified | The worst flight experience I’ve ever encountered. The seat armrest had collapsed and the reclining mechanism was broken meaning the seat continually slid forward and back for the entire 4.5 hour flight. The seat was covered in stains. The discomfort on the entire journey was made worse when I took the issue up with customer care afterwards. I just got a generic sorry and they closed the case, unwilling to do anything to rectify the situation or encourage me to fly with them again. I actually couldn’t believe that a legacy carrier can have such a lack of aftercare. They just want the money and don’t care about repeat business. Never use them again.

### "should have been resolved weeks ago"
On our flight we did not receive any drinks (sparkling water could not be provided pre take-off). When asked about food, we confirmed our order, and re-ordered drinks. Still drinks did not arrive. After 2.5 hours of waiting for any drink or food I decided to go to sleep (it was 00:30 at this time), when the air hostess told me the food was finally ready. By that time I did not feel like eating anything as it was way too late (two hours after being offered food). I complained about this with Etihad - after more than a week the only response I got was to provide booking information (which I did). It is now over three weeks since my initial complaint and Etihad still has not gotten back to me. I'm appalled at the terrible service provided but what's even more galling is the complete lack of care from the customer care staff. This should have been resolved weeks ago but Etihad simply chooses not to engage with customer complaints. Will never fly with this airline again.

### “What has happened to Etihad?”
What has happened to Etihad? I was very disappointed having flown with Etihad many times. First of all, business class was rammed, high prices yet poor in flight service, food and third rate wines including being served sparking wine not champagne - other little luxuries cut back too: chocolates, cookies, basic amenity kit etc I found the service cursory, not once did I feel like a business class passenger, not once was I asked if my food, or for that matter anything else, was ok. No offer to replenish water during both long flights. The food was average, the wine dreadful! It was low cost plonk and nothing like the quality of Etihad of old. So, in summary, far less but for more money. 2 x tickets almost £6k. Etihad is not alone in fleecing customers and should work much harder to impress. They’re not alone, many airlines are making record profits whilst cutting service quality and amenity. Planes are packed, prices are sky high and there’s no quid pro quo with what’s being delivered. Even the lounges are packed, often with non business class passengers who are (understandably) taking advantage of an offer or paying extra. Trouble is, all of this dilutes the quality for business class travellers. Finally, fast track at LHR was a joke, a national embarrassment. SE Asia / Bangkok hugely more efficient. Very disappointing all round.

### "Very good service"
Very good service. There was a guy name Azad in the checkin line and he was very sincere helpful and was handling everything very professionally. He was helping me with every details and he was trying helping and giving his help to everyone. The flight experience is very good too. The seats were very comfortable and monitor works very good. Food was good too. Hopefully i will travel with eithad soon and will have a chance to meet this hospitality again.

### “meal service was pretty bland”
I was not exactly looking forward to two long haul flights to London, especially departing at 2.15 in the morning, and with a 4 hour layover in Abu Dhabi. However, the check-in was smooth, but there was a delay in the incoming aircraft, so we actually departed an hour later. I had booked and paid for extra leg room seats (nearer the front of the aircraft) for both flights. Having 3 inches more leg room did make a difference in comfort. At the seat was placed a pillow and blanket, along with headphones. There was also a very basic amenity kit that just had an eye mask, ear plugs and hand lotion. The pouch itself opens up to a small bag. The meal service on both flights was pretty bland. I also observed that on recent Economy Class flights, the alchoholic drinks served is rather meagre. The wine in the small paper cup was only half full. On one occasion, when I requested whiskey, I felt embarrassed to have no more than a tablespoon served - just enough for one sip! Overall, despite my opinion about the food and drinks, the flights were comfortable. I was even able to doze off for a couple of hours on both flights.

### "must arrive over two hours early"
I had the worst flying experience with Etihad Airways at Abu Dhabi International Airport. I arrived at the airport 1 hour and 40 minutes before my flight to Boston. After waiting in a poorly managed check-in line (where other passengers were allowed to cut in front), I was informed that U.S. citizens must arrive over two hours early, a policy that was never mentioned during booking or on my ticket. The staff was completely unhelpful. I was sent back and forth between the check-in desk and ticket counter for over 30 minutes while my flight boarded. I was then told I could only rebook for the next day at an outrageous cost of $700, with no other options offered, no accommodation, no food vouchers. Etihad’s lack of clarity on policies, dismissive staff, and poor management made this an unbelievably stressful experience. I do not recommend flying with Etihad Airways unless you want to risk being stranded at the airport with no support and forced to pay exorbitant fees.

### "Short term money grab strategy"
As the saying goes fool me twice more fool me ! Etihad appears to now take this as its vision . Flights to in business to Nairobi cancelled last September by them as they cut the route - no explanation - we had to follow up constantly and after months got rebooked onto a flight due to leave today. Applied for Kenyan visa well in advance - one was received the travelling partners was not and frantic trying to get an update. 2 hours to departure still no visa and called Etihad to explain (realise completely it’s not their fault ) but the reply is not our problem . Yes correct - I asked to move the dates - told no - (lies). I asked if they refuse to do so what is the refund policy - (don’t know) Asked had they any idea of what is the policy  we’ll email the team and let you know! Wonderful customer care yet again 13 years as a gold member - ok this is what your offering as service ? Well I have choices - keep your greedy hands on every dime and knickle. Short term money grab strategy

### "responses are vague, unhelpful"
Not Verified |  I had an extremely frustrating experience with this airline, primarily due to their app and help desk. Trying to get any assistance through the app is next to impossible. The interface is confusing, and when you finally manage to get in touch with customer support, the responses are vague, unhelpful, and often seem automated or like a scam. I encountered multiple issues during my booking process, and when I tried to resolve them through the help desk, no one seemed capable of offering a real solution. It felt like they were deliberately avoiding responsibility, and after a lot of back-and-forth, I still had no clear answers. This airline clearly does not prioritize customer service or transparency, and I highly advise against using them. The lack of proper support and the overall negative experience left me completely dissatisfied.

### "substantially more legroom"
With a small fee it’s possible to upgrade to Economy Space which is close to Premium Economy space. Compared to Economy Basic the seat has substantially more legroom and slightly more reclining. The food was delicious given the class of travel. Toilets clean. Etihad is now my priority when possible.

### "a good economy"
Etihad has a good economy, and I sat on the A350-1000 from ORD to AUH, and with A380 from AUH to BOM. Seat comfort on the A350 made me feel like I was on the driver's seat of my BMW. Food was better on the first leg of the flight, and could have been better on the second. However, on the A350, there were no plugs provided, so could not charge laptop. That is what Etihad needs to look at for once.

### "Far below expectations."
My experience with Etihad Airways was extremely disappointing and far below the expectations for an airline of this calibre. First, I was informed just a few hours before landing in Abu Dhabi that all hotels participating in the stopover programme were fully booked. This forced me to find last-minute accommodation at a much higher cost, with the risk of not finding availability. Despite several attempts to contact the company, I received no response, highlighting a severe lack of professionalism and customer care. Additionally, the flights themselves were equally frustrating. Both on the Lisbon to Abu Dhabi and Abu Dhabi to Bali routes, the seat space was extremely cramped, making the journey very uncomfortable, especially for long-haul flights. The food served on all legs of the trip was of very low quality, far below that offered by other airlines operating hubs like Doha or Dubai. Etihad clearly lags behind in terms of service quality and passenger comfort. I definitely do not recommend Etihad Airways. If you're looking for a comfortable travel experience with good service, there are far better options available on the market.

### "the competition is better"
Big disappointment, it has high hopes with one of the three big airlines in the Gulf area and it is far below its rivals Emirates and Qatar and direct European competitors. The seats are quite uncomfortable although the width is perfect, the legroom is correct and the seats are very uncomfortable for long flights. The food is very poor in terms of quantity, in terms of quality it is normal, the food service on board is quite chaotic and outside the standard of the rest of the airlines in the same category. The inflight entertainment system is the best of the airline, a multitude of movies and in perfect Spanish. Customer service is zero and if you have to complain via phone or email they will not pay attention. I was charged for a service that was not offered to me and I have not been refunded. At the same price or for 10%-15% more, the competition is better. | Gran decepción, tiene altas esperanzas con una de las tres grandes aerolínea de la zona del Golfo y está muy por debajo de sus rivales Emirates y Qatar y de competidoras directas europeas. Los asientos son bastante incómodos si bien el ancho es perfecto, el espacio para las piernas el correcto z los asientos son muy incómodos para vuelos largos. La comida es muy pobre en cuanto a cantidad, respecto a la calidad es normal, el servicio de comidas a bordo es bastante caótico y fuera del estándar del resto de aerolíneas de su misma categoría. El sistema de entretenimiento a bordo es lo mejor de la aerolínea, multitud de películas y en perfecto castellano. Atención al cliente es nula y si tenéis que reclamar vía teléfonica o email no van hacer caso. Me cobraron por un servicio que no se me ofreció y no se me ha reembolsado. A igualdad de precio o por un 10%-15% más mejor la competencia.

### “poor customer service”
I flew business class and as usual on other airlines, my jacket was taken by the flight attendant, but she never returned it. I have filed a complaint which took more than three weeks to be answered and the only response is that I should take care of my belongings and should have asked the flight attendants to take my jacket. It shows that they do not even properly read the messages. The jacket was taken in the first place by the flight attendant. I contacted their customer service chat and the only response is that I should wait for the answer from customer service. I will certainly never fly again with this airline. It is not the jacket, it is their poor customer service. Other airlines, specially with business class passengers, respond in a more promptly and caring manner.

### "lack of transparency for the issue"
First time flying Etihad and I assure you it will be my last. We are currently sitting on the plane at 5:20pm on the runway at JFK for a flight that was supposed to leave at 1:40pm. We were sitting on the runway, pilot said “we should be on our way in no time” and the next thing you know we were there for 90 minutes without any update. We have heard at least 7 times over these past 4 hours that it will be “another 20 minutes or so” we haven’t been given an explanation as to what the issue is. The problem I have is the lack of transparency for the issue. Last update we received was 20 minutes and that refreshments were coming. 2 bottles of water for a flight of 300 plus people was the extent of the refreshments. Here’s the kicker - the engine is off so there is no air conditioning.

### Etihad Airways customer review
My recent journey with Etihad from NYC to Mumbai (08/30/2024) and back was an absolute nightmare. Outbound our JFK flight was delayed by 9 hours with poor communication and a $20 food voucher that barely covered anything. After boarding, the flight was diverted to London, where we sat on the tarmac for 3 hours for a crew change. Once in Abu Dhabi, we missed our connecting flight and had to sprint across terminals without assistance. We arrived in Mumbai 18 hours late. Filed a complaint about the ordeal, but after 60 days, no response. Customer service claimed it’s handled by another department, offering no help or updates. The return flight from Mumbai (11/09/2024) was canceled after hours of standing at check-in with no seating or luggage drop-off. We were rebooked on a 4:20 AM flight but waited another 3 hours on the tarmac. Upon reaching Abu Dhabi, our NYC flight had already departed. Etihad rebooked us 36 hours later, leaving us exhausted, with shifting schedules and constant misinformation. In total, this trip involved over 54 hours of delays, poor communication, and zero accountability. Etihad’s customer service is unresponsive, dismissive, and offers no compensation. I’ll never fly with Etihad again.

### "downgraded her to economy"
My daughters had just a weeks trip to Mumbai from USA and we booked her business class. While returning in Mumbai she was given 2 boarding passes for the onward journey. On reaching Abu Dhabi, they downgraded her to economy citing the reason of flight overbooked. They even denied her the lounge entry. After fighting they allowed her lounge entry but yet downgraded her. We had booked ticket 3 months early for her comfortable travel. Etihad is one of the expensive so the cost of the ticket was high 3 months prior and yet she was downgraded. This experience ensures we never fly Etihad and warning others too that this might happen to you despite paying high fares.

### "pathetic customer support"
Terrible airline, pathetic customer support and always trying to loot the customer. Their customer support agent told me to book another connecting flight because the first one had more than 24 hours layover. I booked another flight and they did not let me board the plane because there were two different bookings.

### “hidden fees are terrible”
Not Verified | We booked our flight with Etihad and it said that one of our family members had a name that was too long. It didnt say anything else but "contact Etihad and we can change it after your booking". I did as told and then it cost me 100 dollars to get it changed. These hidden fees are terrible and enough to make me not want to support Etihad.

### "exasperated with this organisation"
A brisk feedback and one is exasperated with this organisation. They just fail to get it right again and again and again. Last 5 flights - crew under trained - not able to manage the service on board - overwhelmed . On the ground app is useless - call centre useless. Only good thing about this airline is that Abu Dhabi is the base and is the ONLY reason to date to use them. Final straw this time flying business and total mess up again with seats - paid for upgrade to 1st class lounge with receipt and 25 minute debacle on gaining access. Not good enough - not acceptable. Happy to now fly Qatar with a stop over - after 12 years loyality. The reviews here don’t lie. Avoid this airline

### “absolutely never again”
Not Verified | Absolutely shocking to be honest. I thought this was supposed to be one of the best airlines. You cannot add extra baggage after 24 hours prior to the flight. Website clearly states it is $44 USD per 5 KG from Europe to the Middle East. Woman at airport said this is not set in stone and charged me 680 EUROS for my baggage. I did not have this money - I had to leave loads of mine and my daughter's clothes. I know what some people will be thinking, that I should know this etc - BUT I do fly all the time and I tried to book extra baggage and they wouldn't allow it. The website clearly states it will cost $44 per 5kg at the airport but NOPE. This is a Toal lie and subject to change by 4 times the amount apparently. Woman then wanted our Emirates ID even though we had already given our passport and husbands emirates ID had expired whilst we were away - she took this to her manager to see if this is ok - How ridiculous! We can still enter the UAE with a passport so what did this matter! She was absolutely horrible. Expected the plane journey to be better but nope. They ran out of water on the flight so no water, no tea, no coffee, and no water to flush peoples excrement on the toilet. Wonderful. Wasn't aware you have to pre book a children's meal as there was nowhere about this on the 'MY BOOKING' page when I had previously looked. Most flights just give you a kids meal when you're booking a kids ticket! Staff brought my 4 year old a pack of crayons as the captain announced our decent into Dubai. a bit too late. Overall - absolutely never again.

### "refused any refund"
Not Verified |  Worst customer service. On 30June24, I was flying from Istanbul to Abu Dhabi with my family of 4 and 15 minutes before the gate closing the new gate was announced and the new gate was also 15 minutes away by walk! It was Impossible to reach new gate which was gate F from old gate which was A. There was no announcement, no phone call, no announcement on LED screens at boarding gate, no Etihad staff looking for passengers with boarding passes already issued to them waiting at the previous gate. Later we got to know there is no office and no staff of Etihad always at Istanbul airport. Etihad is managed by third party called Celebi. When we contacted call center they told us that penalty of No Show would be charged and only our travel agent can book the flight. When our travel agent tried to book the next flight there were no seats available for 2 days. We booked Qatar airways which cost us 2400USD but the service level was on another level compared to Etihad Airways. As per Etihad Airways rules full refund is eligible if boarding time is less than 30 minutes, in our case the boarding started at 6:50 and gate closed at 7:15 and at 7:00 the gate change also happened. Its common sense that why would family of four people with boarding passes already issued to them and they are sitting at boarding gate well in advance will miss there flight? Etihad airways customer service has refused any refund or compensation via email on 12 July24.

### "appalling customer service"
Not Verified |  I was a frequent flyer of Etihad (gold) and being based out of Abu Dhabi used it regularly for 5 years - however an extremely negative experience in Dec 2022 made me never travel Etihad again. There was a problem of a flight that got cancelled by a partner airline (though I had booked my ticket with Etihad and had a Etihad code) . I flew on my own for the leg that was cancelled simply because there was no staff available in the airport to help. However, Etihad ground crew in Delhi made me buy a new ticket for a second leg of my journey. When I reached Abu Dhabi and called their contact center, wrote emails and via their social media messaging - - however no help was extended and I did not receive a single call back. This was dismaying customer service - I paid twice for the same tickets and not a single call to explain why am I responsible for a cancelled flight It's been 2 years and I have not taken a single Etihad flight (though I live in Abu Dhabi) and it's the most practical option - I use Abu Dhabi airport, but use either Turkish or Qatar airways for all my long haul options. They have appalling customer service the last 2 years !

### "fallen for the same promotion"
The Etihad Airways website encourages passengers to enjoy a two-day stopover in Abu Dhabi and promises free accommodation during the stop-over. The website also lists a number of top-hotels (mostly 3- and 4-star hotels) where passengers are entitled to stay. Obviously, one can only choose the hotel after you have purchased the tickets. In my case, the offer of accommodation turned out to be a scam! Immediately after booking my tickets to Europe, I tried unsuccessfully to book my accommodation on the airline website. Subsequently, I called the airline call center for assistance. Initially, the call center offered to escalate; then asked to keep an eye for their email; and finally, just three days before my return told me arrange my own accommodation. They refused to give me a reference for my request so I have no record of my correspondence. A casual search on the internet shows many others have fallen for the same promotion. For a major airline to scam their passengers leaves a very bad taste. The airline should worry about their reputational damage.

### “Everything was unacceptable”
Worst plane ever, EY718, 26 October 2024. First the flight was delayed for 3 hours. Small and uncomfortable seats. No meal just a tiny chicken sandwich. Everything was unacceptable.

### “Terrible, terrible customer service”
Will never fly with Etihad again. Plane seemed really old, poor picture on the screens and very uncomfortable seats! Paid to reserve seats on the flight home with extra leg room - only to be told upon arrival at the airport that the plane had been changed so we had been reallocated seats. Alas, without the extra leg room we paid for. Asked if we could get a refund on the payment for the seats we never saw and, to cut a very long story short, after 5 months still havent received anything despite chasing them up on numerous occasions. Terrible, terrible customer service! Avoid!! Pay more to fly with someone else if you need to!

### "less than satisfactory"
Not Verified | The first leg of my journey (Dub/Abu Dhabi) took the mickey. The flight took off ninety minutes late, food was barely edible and it was a cramped experience in terms of seating. Second leg was an improvement, flight was on time, food reasonably tasty and a bit more spacious in terms of leg room. Overall would I recommend Etihad, definitely not in economy as the experience was less than satisfactory.

### "food barely edible"
Awful. Planes run down, broken tray table with disgusting food spills all through the inside where table had completely split, my daughter’s food kept sliding off into her due to table coming off on one side. Her TV was also broken and not working which made the 14 hour flight very long. One of the air hostesses stood on my bare foot with her heel with no apology. Horrible food barely edible apart from the last meal. Wifi cost to purchase ridiculous.

### "unreliable and untrustworthy"
I traveled with Etihad Airways in February 2024, relocating to Australia, and it was the most frustrating travel experience I’ve ever had. They lost my luggage, which contained essential items like medications, electronics, makeup, and household goods. After two months of supposedly searching, they confirmed they couldn't find my luggage. I then filed a claim for the value of my lost items, which came to around 8,000 AUD, only for them to offer me a ridiculous 405 USD – barely covering the cost of my suitcase! Despite multiple attempts to negotiate for a fair compensation, they flat-out refused to increase the amount. What’s worse is that after I begrudgingly accepted this insult of an offer, they asked for my bank details to transfer the compensation. Fast forward 9 months, and I still haven’t received a single cent. I’ve provided the same details over and over, yet their staff are utterly clueless. Every time I contact them, I have to retell the whole story because they have no idea what’s going on. It’s clear they’re just using delay tactics to avoid paying me. I’ve lost thousands of dollars worth of items, and I’m beyond furious. I will never travel with Etihad again and would strongly advise anyone else to avoid them at all costs. This airline is completely unreliable and untrustworthy!

### "A very bad experience"
Not Verified | Our flight from Boston on the way to Abu Dhabi started 30mins late on 2/09/2024. Food served by 7Ok usa time, after that no crew member answered any calls for water even. Next meal was served at 10.30 am Abu Dhabi time. The passengers kept asking but no response .. water too was given sparingly. A flight that charges so much for a ticket cant serve a small snack to travellers in between. They serve oreo cookies and  kitkat. The staff is pathetic, e flew three consecutive months everyone had the same pathetic experience. A very bad experience.

### "one of the worst customer service"
Not Verified | 
Sorry to say but Etihad has one of the worst customer services. First of all if you have changed your booking once, Etihad doesn’t allow you to change the booking again on your own. You have to go through their agents to update it again. And it took me almost 1 hour 30 mins to get my ticket updated with a customer service rep. You telling me if I should reserve almost 2 hours from my day to change the departure date on a flight? Then, you are doing something wrong as a company.

### "been a terrible experience"
My flight was from Dublin  to Mumbai  via Abu Dhabi. Due to a delay in Dublin, I missed my connecting flight. The airline offered accommodation and booked me on an alternative flight the next day at 14:00, whereas my original flight was at 21:50. The staff took my passport to process my visa and told me to wait for six hours before they could arrange accommodation. This has been a terrible experience with Etihad, and the staff were rude and unhelpful. Traveling with Etihad was my biggest mistake; it was my first and last time flying with them.

### "never fly with Etihad again"
I have never experienced this bad customer service like this trip with Etihad. First, it took them two hours to just check us in, as a supposedly sophisticated international airline they seemed to weirdly lack the experience in dealing with some nationalities. Second, they rescheduled our flight for 6 hours later than original, so now we have to wait 9 hours at the airport overnight with no proper service what so ever, not even a lounge nor a place to stay, no nothing. All they could say is that we can rest at gate E for the next 9 hours! I shall never fly with Etihad again. Neither recommend.

### "felt disrespected and ignored"
Not Verified | A Fruit Platter had been ordered by my daughter. However, I switched seats with her as she wanted the window seat. The steward refused to offer an alternative to me and said I cannot any meal from the menu card and only if there was something left over after 3-4 hours could he give me something. My daughter slept and did not eat anything! He did not take any order or offer an alternative. After 7 hours into the flight a stewardess (not the steward) came and asked "maybe you want something". I felt disrespected and ignored. And then I had lost all appetite.

### "a deeply disappointing journey"
Not Verified | I recently experienced a deeply disappointing journey with Etihad Airways on my flight from Adelaide to Brussels on September 19, 2024. My trip was marked by significant issues that left me frustrated and dissatisfied. To begin with, my baggage was lost during transit, which contained three crucial conference posters I needed for an international conference the following Monday. Not only did the posters fail to arrive, but I received confusing emails indicating they were supposedly arriving at different airports and at various times. This lack of clarity was incredibly stressful, forcing me to incur unexpected costs to print the posters again. I submitted a claim online for reimbursement, but I have yet to hear back from Etihad regarding this matter. Adding to my frustration, my return flight was delayed, causing me to miss my connecting flight from Sydney to Adelaide. While transiting in Abu Dhabi, I inquired about this delay, hoping for assistance. Unfortunately, the Etihad staff were unhelpful and insisted that the flight between Sydney and Adelaide was the responsibility of Virgin Australia, which I found to be inaccurate and misleading. Also, when enquiring Etihad air hostesses about the possibility of giving priority to disembark to customer with connecting flights, they said that they were unable to do so and that many people on the flight were having the same issue and were unable to give any priorities for early disembarking to anyone. This lack of accountability only added to my frustration. Eventually, I had to call my work travel agent, who were able to book me another flight with Qantas. Neither Virgin Airlines or Etihad were able to provide help get me into another flight as a direct result of a flight delay from Etihad. I submitted a complaint to Etihad and asked for a refund of this new flight, which should have been done by Etihad, but unfortunately I have not heard back from them, yet. Overall, my experience with Etihad’s customer service was far from satisfactory. I encountered rude and unhelpful staff, both in person and over the phone, where my calls were abruptly ended rather than addressed. I sincerely hope that Etihad takes this feedback seriously and implements improvements in communication, responsiveness, and customer care. Enhancing these areas would greatly benefit future passengers and help restore confidence in the airline.

### “lack of professionalism”
In more than 50 trips, I've never received a worst treatment in terms of customer service but left alone, in an intermediate country during a stopover. My initial flight from Pune to Delhi never reached Delhi due to bad weather conditions but landed in Lucknow with the consequent miss of the following segment. Eventually Vistara re-booked this flight the bery next day. Once in Abu Dhabi, where I was supposed to do a 2 nights stopover, as sponsored by Etihad itself, I've found that by rebooking the flight, my reservation for the final destination, Abu Dhabi - Rome Fiumicino has been cancelled! After calling both the customer service numbers in Italy and Abu Dhabi, I've been told that it was impossible to restore my reservation because the flight, a flight which was confirmed until 24h before, was fully booked and they could place me on the following flight in 5 days time. Furthermore, the eventual hotel stay was supposed to be paid in advance by myself and eventually submit a refund request. In the meantime, while trying to insist with the customer service that finding myself a hotel room with such a short notice, in a foreign city, where I was travelling alone, wasn't acceptable, I checked on the Etihad website and was able to book the exact same flight (1350euros). This was the flight the CS said was fully booked. Nevertheless, I've been accused of a No Show thus all customer service officers were impossibilities of placing me on the return flight under initial booking reference until less than 48hours prior my return flight. The lack of professionalism of Etihad stroke me and risked to leave me alone in a Stopover city for 5 days, forcing me to pay for an extra flight, pay also the cancellation fees for the flight I also, in the meantime, purchased with another company for the 25th of August. I would also like to highlight that, I opened the 1st claim in August and still didn't hear back from them altough the customer service comunicated that a feedback shall be given within 28 days.

### "Such a horrible airline"
Horrible carry on baggage policy. The combined weight of laptop bag or backpack or purse and a carry on bag can’t exceed 15 lb. How can you bring anything onboard when the weight of empty bags itself will be like 5-7 lbs. When flying from US to India I didn’t have the issue with Carry on bag weight. But when returning from India I wasn’t allowed to carry more than 15 lbs combined carry on weight. The ticket had mentioned that only linear dimensions are restricted but not the weight but Etihad staff didn’t listen to me. I had to leave 6 lbs of weight behind. Such a horrible airline which doesn’t honor its own policy per the ticket issued. Avoid it at all cost.

### "Flight was delayed 2.45 hours"
Not Verified | Flight was delayed 2.45 hours. After arriving early from NYC total layover time at the airport was 3+ hours, no information provided. Gate changed twice, so run around in the airport. Terrible 1st experience with Etihad. Contacted airline and they did not offer anything but the new gate number. Missed my ride in Delhi.

### "the crew was the worst"
Abu Dhabi to Jeddah on 27th September 2024/ 2.05 am. The Aircraft was decent, food was delicious, but the crew was the worst. A passenger wanted to go to the washroom while the attendant lady cleared the food trays. He was waiting for some time and then he asked the attendant he needs some space to go to the washroom, then she replied we’re busy sir wait for some time. Then he waited for like 3 mins and asked again then she replied again with an irritated voice “ we’re still busy sir wait, then lastly he asked again , then she gave him some space, and uttered something seeing the passenger from the back. A passenger pressed the call button and the air hostess reached to the passenger after 9 mins, which I believe is a very long time . And when the button was already pressed another attendant passed it and went to the front without even noticing it, maybe she ignored. Drinks were not offered for everyone.

### “a very disappointing experience”
This airline has sadly gone cheap. I flew with Etihad twice previously and they had modern planes with passenger-friendly policies. Now, the planes are dated and they do everything they can to get a few extra dollars from you. I had advance seating options, but these were changed at the last minute. Also, with my ANA star alliance Gold status, I was previously given benefits, since ANA was a “mileage partner”. This included priority check in, boarding, and most importantly, lounge use. This time, none of these benefits were given, and ground staff was quite rude, and seemed proud of their ignorance as to why this policy changed. One bright side: to food is still pretty tasty. Overall, a very disappointing experience though.

### "deeply disappointing experience"
Terrible Experience with Etihad Airlines – Never Again! I had a deeply disappointing experience flying with Etihad Airlines recently. Our flight was rescheduled. This change forced us to scramble and buy new tickets for our local connecting flights, which ended up costing us a significant amount of extra money. To make matters worse, when we reached out to Etihad for compensation for the additional expenses we incurred due to their schedule change, they outright denied any responsibility. The lack of communication (Etihad took almost 2 months to respond), poor service, and refusal to assist us left us feeling completely disregarded as customers. This experience was stressful and costly, and I’m incredibly frustrated with how Etihad handled the situation. I would not recommend flying with them unless you’re prepared for unexpected changes and no support when things go wrong.

### "Downgrading without compensation"
JFK to Bangalore, August 30th to 31st. I arrived at T4 at 10 am, Etihad had a surprise for us - a 6.5-hour delay! No email, no SMS. Upon check-in, I was offered a choice: proceed or get a full refund. The Etihad lounge, a beacon of information... or not. Staff seemed to be playing a game of "Who Knows Least About Transfer Tickets. The winner? A lovely lady who offered me water to "ease" my concerns. How thoughtful! Just when I thought things couldn't get more exciting, Etihad threw in a plot twist - a detour via London! The 1.5-hour crew change in London was the cherry on top of this delay sundae. In a magnanimous gesture, Etihad arranged for me to fly earlier - only 26 hours late instead of 30! The catch? A downgrade to the economy and no compensation. This was a special arrangement in favour of no compensation, no offer to upgrade the next flight.. all at a ransom. Take it or leave it. The grand finale - a 42-year-old man sprinting through the airport with 12kg of luggage. Because nothing says "premium travel experience" like an impromptu marathon. As I prepare for my return journey on October 5th, I find myself wondering: Will this be another Etihad adventure, or my last dance with your airline? I hope you see the myriad issues here: Lack of timely communication about delays. Inadequate assistance for missed connections. Poorly informed staff at various touchpoints Downgrading without compensation or an offer to upgrade the next flight. Failure to update the app with crucial information Overall disregard for customer comfort and convenience I've been a frequent customer, frequently flying business and first class. I'm curious - is this how Etihad aims to retain its premium passengers?

### "not like a valued customer at all"
Changing of selected seats after booking was impossible via website and app as well. Call center not responsive. When change finally possible at online check-in, I had to pay additional fees. After booking a flood of marketing mails offering paid upgrades to business class, nearly every day. Additionally invitations to get a member and enjoy "big rewards" like free WiFi Chat. On board nothing to find about WiFi Chat, crew can't help. The staff at passport control and security check at the airports was a lot more responsive to friendly behavior then the staff of Etihad. Felt not like a valued customer at all. On one of the flights of my journey 3 ladies sitting in front of my row, were very annoying for all passengers around with loud noise, permanent special orders and garbage around. The crew acted with them like 1st-class, while complaints from other passengers were totally ignored. I was woken up and asked 40min before landing to make my seat up, while they were allowed to leave their seats far backward. Complaints ignored. Food quality & taste changed from flight to flight. Starting from Abu Dhabi very poor quality, starting from other airports much better. This regards the standard meals same as the special meal some of my group had.

### "regret choosing this airline"
The entire flight was a disaster. My flight from CCJ to AUH was delayed by 55 minutes and while entering the Calicut airport 4 hours before the departure, I was told my flight is rerouted and there would be an additional stop in Frankfurt apart from Abudhabi. This made by whole journey delayed by 5 hours . The CCJ groundstaff lied to me saying the AUH-DUB was cancelled due to some aircraft issue and the changed flight (AUH-FRA-DUB) was made for the same reason. When I reached Abu dhabi, I got to know the AUH-DUB was overbooked and hence I was rerouted to Frankfurt and then to Dublin. Instead of reaching 7:30 am in the morning I landed in Dublin at 12:30 pm. I had to face the trouble for overbooking which was not even my fault. All arrangements I made for my pickup in Dublin had to be all cancelled because of this inconvenience. I really wonder how this airline won any awards as they claim in 2022. The customer service is a joke and I regret choosing this airline

### "Worst return flight experience ever"
Worst return flight experience ever. RUH to CGK and CGK to RUH. Having online boarding pass in the Etihad app was not welcome by ground staff they insisted me to have paper/printed boarding pass it's nonsense, uncomfortable seat, charging port not working, one crew insisted charge my mobile in their kitchen pantry and when I asked to return my mobile they don't know it because the previous crew on break rest it's becoming very difficult/hassle for me as I don't know the crew name, unfriendly crew none of them introduced themselves - how was I supposed to know their name? I traveled with a 3year old kid and the crews didn't make it any easier. Worthless Etihad Guest membership since 2018 nothing valued, respected, and recognized as member.

### "they didn't refund my money"
I had a flight from Phuket to Abu Dhabi and from Dubai to Bishkek after (by Emirates). But Etihad told me that my flight is overbooked and I don't fly today. I lost time, money for my second tickets, and also now 22 days already and they didn't refund my money for original tickets ($2100, not cheap).

### "Definitely not fly with Etihad again"
Definitely not fly with Etihad again. Try a different airways which does proper service. They offer low cost and when you end up with issues, there will be no response from Etihad. I paid approximately Euros 700 flying from Dublin to Chennai via Abu Dhabi, while in Abu Dhabi i missed the flight as there was only 1 hour between transit. In this hour you have to clear the airport security and then do your rest room activities. I did miss the flight and the boarding gate was closed within 30 mins. Fine what happens next will bother you. - Etihad airways told me to go away from the area and stay in the main area till i book my new flights - I did book a new flight on my expense in the next 24 hours for which i was asked to book again via Etihad airways only and the cost was Euros 250 - I did ask for a stay there till i get my new flight, but i was denied even not a water bottle. My return flights from Chennai to Abu Dhabi were also cancelled by Etihad. The no show fees was Euros 520, which is more than the cost of the flight if you book from Chennai to Abu Dhabi. I have not travelled on my return flight, why cant they pay it back. I am now booking my own flight back, but this is inhumane and no way you can contact the customer support.

### "I was totally disappointed"
Not Verified |   I traveled from JFK to Mumbai and back on the same route. On both routes I had specifically prebooked my meal preference of Hindu meal. However on both routes I did not get the preferred meal and was offered the general meal. It was manageable while going to Mumbai but on the way back I had made sure I prebooked my meal and was offered either a lamb meal which I don’t eat or paneer and I am allergic to paneer. I had nothing to eat for 13 hours of the flight. I requested the staff if they had any snacks they could give me once they finished serving the meal to everyone and she said she would get me something but no one got me even a pack of cookies or chips. I was told that the meal being served to all is the meal I had asked for which is NOT true. I don’t see the point of booking a meal 2 days before the flight if I am anyways going to be served the regular meal. No one even bothered to come and find out if I was ok or neeeded anything given I hadn’t got a meal for 13 hours. This was my first time via Etihad and I was totally disappointed

### “never accept a credit”
Etihad is a scam airline. I got a credit for a flight that was canceled - over $4.5k. Then they changed the travel bank system and emailed saying the system would be unavailable for a period of time and I would receive my new login details when it was back up. They didn't send me any further information nor did they respond to my customer service emails. During this time my credit expired and they refused to extend it - they are thieves and scam artists - avoid booking with them - and if you do have to book never accept a credit - you will never see the value.

### "Please do not fly with Etihad"
Please do not fly with Etihad. Their customer service is appalling. We were booked to fly to Rome but unfortunately never made it. A few weeks after booking, I was diagnosed with brain cancer and had to cancel our trip. Etihad’s customer service was absolutely terrible. After a dozen phone calls spanning months trying to move/credit/refund our flights, they are still yet to do it. They made no attempt to provide clear information about the process, or the status of the claim. We found out on the last call that the reason it was causing issue was because my partner and I aren’t married. Despite being together for years, living at the same address they refuse to recognize a de facto relationship and flat out refused to credit/refund his ticket. Mine is still “pending”. At no point did they have any sort of sincerity towards the situation and made what was a difficult time in ours lives so much worse. This was also after they originally double charged me for the two plane tickets which took two weeks to be refunded. Which also required dozen of hours spent on hold, with no explanation as to how it happened in the first place. I can’t stress enough how disappointed I was and I will never be flying with Etihad again. It takes a lot for me to get frustrated enough to post on the internet but I want to make sure this doesn’t happen to other. We also booked directly with them (no 3rd parties) so it just shouldn’t have been this difficult. So many other airlines are better, avoid Etihad

### "experience is shocking"
Etihad airways is the worst airline on the planet. Don't be fooled by the deals offered, they have put us through hell. They cancelled our flight mid journey. They sent us reminders to check in from London Heathrow to Abu Dhabi before check in. We checked in and travelled to Abu Dhabi with Etihad airways. They sponsored our visa in Abu Dhabi which can only be done on the basis of a valid ticket onwards from Abu Dhabi to another destination. When I tried to book wheelchair assist for the Abu Dhabi to Nairobi leg of the flight, I was informed that the flight was cancelled in May. How did we travel on this ticket to Abu Dhabi on Etihad? How was our visa sponsored in July if our ticket was cancelled since we used our tickets as proof that we would be leaving Abu Dhabi after 96 hours? We even had a hotel booking sponsored by Etihad airlines under the free stopover and we checked into the hotel and stayed there for the time sponsored by Etihad? How was this possible on a cancelled ticket. We have been in touch with Etihad via online chats and have records, phone calls which unfortunately we have no records, email and face to face at the airport as well as social media. They insist we must have a case number which can only be generated if you contact them via their website. The feedback form will not accept our flight number so we can't create a case. In the meantime, our journey destined for Nairobi via Etihad with arrival of 1.05 pm on 11th August has been severely disrupted. We were rerouted through the slowest available route adding more than 36 hours to our journey. We have not been offered food, water or accommodation. Etihad insists that they communicated flight cancellation but every person from Etihad who responds to us on chat or social media provides different dates for when communication about cancellation was done. If our flight was cancelled, why were we not informed before being invited to check in online in August and being issued with a 96 hour visa in July to visit UAE as well as being hosted in an Etihad sponsored hotel as Etihad guests on the ticket which they claim was cancelled. When a ticket is cancelled, aren't alternative flight arrangements made or refunds after informing the customer? Etihad has now been asking as since Thursday 8th August to cancel the ticket for a refund. What kind of dishonest behaviour is this? Taking customers money in February and issuing flight tickets and then asking customers to cancel the tickets for a refund after 5 months when ticket prices have peaked and they can't get the same journey for the same amount as prices are more than double. We bought a service but the delivery is disappointing. Our return flight that has now been offered by Etihad is 35 hours and we are travelling with children. Etihad should not ask me for a case number as they have not issued me with one even though I have been in constant communication with them. If they wish to address this issue, let them provide an email address where I can resend them the same information I have communicated via online chat, telephone and face to face. The online feedback system says my flight number is invalid so I will never be able to submit a case if they only have one mode of receiving complaints. The experience is shocking. I never imagined a company would be this dishonest and uncaring. Online complaints and poor reviews confirm this bad

### "worst customer service"
My family came through Etihad Airways. Their luggage was broken while handling by the Airline employees. I did complain twice on line and contact customer service regarding my complaint. No one get back to me. Nor I have received any response from the airline. The worst customer service. I have never seen such a bad airline.

### "leg space was painfully compromised"
Disappointing from the previous times especially the flight service/staff behaviour. The food was again just okay on the flight from Bangkok to Abu Dhabi. The leg space was also painfully compromised.

### "a really bad flight"
It was a really bad flight. The air conditioning blew very cold air and cooled down so much that people froze and even had to cover themselves with blankets. It also caused me health problems. There was no way to regulate the air in individual seats. To assume that every passenger needs exactly the same temperature and then to set it as very cold is an absolute disgrace. Even reporting it to the flight crew several times didn't change anything. They then said that we should put blankets over our heads!

### "Never again with Etihad"
Not Verified |   Horror to deal with at airport counter of Etihad airways. My old and non-English speaking relatives missed the flight due to gate change at Columbus airport and was rebooked by American Airlines the next day via Chicago ORD. The luggage already left for Boston. When they reached the Chicago next day, the rude and unprofessional counter agents refused to honor the booking even though it wa confirmed by the Etihad customer service. The staff won’t let them board without luggage which we didn’t have as it had left without us. Finally they made thru the security and reached the gate anyway and yet again the same staff was there but this time a kind staff helped my relatives to talk to the manager who reissued the new ticket in no time. Never again with Etihad.

### "Terrible customer service"
Terrible customer service throughout. Damaged / lost parts of my my daughter's wheelchair during outbound flight going to Abu Dhabi, reported on arrival, daughter spent the whole week holiday struggling to use her only method of mobility. 3 months down the road and still not single acknowledgement or apology from the customer service after numerous calls, emails and messages. Finally now accepted to compensate for the physical cost of replacement of missing parts/damage repair. Dealing with customers service during all this time was like dealing with interrogation department of criminal courts from the amount of documents and forms to fill. Never again. Advice to others, document and take photos of everything, just incase you had to deal with them for lost or damaged property. Or don't fly with them.

### "never travel again with Etihad"
Not Verified |   Though I had several options from Bengaluru to Dublin, I booked Etihad thinking that at least it will take me to the destination on the same day. The flight was delayed from Bengaluru. The Dublin flight left on time. The booked us a flight the next day. First, they said accommodation will be provided, later we were told it would take at least six hours to process the Visa. When I asked them if it's the case with passenger travelling in other classes, I was told it's same. I had a terrible experience sitting on a chair and walking around it for almost 12 hours. I would never travel again with Etihad.

### “I had a terrible time”
I paid for an Aisle seat in front 18 C on making a payment of €48.18 just for the sake of my medical issues to go to toilet frequently but the seat was not reclining and neither the USB charging port was working. I reported the same to cabin crew for the same. I had a terrible time for 6 hrs flight with sever backache as I am a Senior Citizen. On my way from Bombay to Barcelona was amazing. This was an ordeal and stressful. I need my payment to be refunded.

### "customer service has to be the worst"
The customer service at this airline has to be the worst I have ever experienced. Long story short, what should have been a simple name change on a ticket has not only lead to me missing a return flight from Australia to Europe, yet also prevented me from buying another ticket on the same flight. I've since been going in circles with customer support, who have been panning me off and telling me I would receive a call. I just spoke to an incredible rude, blunt and unhelpful agent who had no idea of the issue and lied multiple times when he told me he had read the live chat I had with an agent the day before. It was clear that he had no idea of the issue and did not have access to the chat despite me emphasising how crucial the information in there was. I have been screwed around completely and have now had around 8 interactions with Etihad staff who have been unable to assist in the slightest.

### "this was the worst experience"
Our flight from Shanghai to Abu Dhabi was OK but the second leg to London was a nightmare. We were supposed to take off at 2am but were advised that there would be a delay. After some time they said ground crew were working to fix the air-conditioning on the right side of the plane. We were sitting near the galley and couldn't help overhearing the flight attendants bitching about how they wouldn't be paid until the plane was in the air. We ended up sitting in the full, hot aircraft for 4 hours and being given only two small cups of water during that time. We were then asked to disembark but given no explanation of what we should do next. We had to wait until 7.30am to be taxied to a hotel for breakfast and a shower. When we finally took off at 2pm, there was a cursory apology from the flight deck and a new and more friendly crew. For lack of communication, empathy and professionalism, this was the worst experience we have ever had.

### "the worst experience ever"
I flew from Melbourne to Madrid return via Abu Dhabi. I claimed the miles online and I only got the miles from two flights. This was from Melbourne to Abu Dhabi and Abu Dhabi to Melbourne. The other two flights they said they will update the miles on my account but I still can’t see them updated. I have been exchanging emails with them since May 24 until now. They are trying to keep me happy sending emails saying they are doing their best but I don’t believe a word they say. This is the worst experience ever and I don’t recommend this airline to anyone at all.

### "try to avoid this airline"
It was one of the worst experiences with Etihad Airways on my recent flight from Toronto to Karachi via Abu Dhabi. The cup holder had chewing gum that I had to remove myself using tissue paper. The tray table was broken, which I only noticed when food was served and drinks spilled on my shirt. The food was average, and the tray was served without any paper, directly with the meal. Etihad's quality has significantly declined. It used to be a good airline 9-10 years ago, but now it is one of the worst. The aircraft appeared very old by the look of the interior. I will try to avoid this airline in the future.

### "disappointing and frustrating"
My recent experience with Etihad Airways on an international flight from Bangalore to Boston was disappointing and frustrating. The ordeal began with repeated flight delays without clear explanations, initially delaying departure by an hour, then extending to two more hours without any reasonable justification. After waiting painfully for 6 hours, the flight was suddenly canceled, leaving passengers feeling lost and frustrated. Etihad's management handled the situation poorly, showing a blatant disregard for the inconvenience caused to passengers. Instead of arranging alternative flights, they scheduled me for a replacement flight 20 hours later, with two additional connecting flights, each burdened with layovers of 8 hours and 7 hours respectively. This resulted in an waste of nearly 32 hours of travel time. Throughout this travel, there was a glaring lack of empathy or support from Etihad's staff, who seemed indifferent to the plight of their customers. No compensatory measures were offered, despite the significant inconvenience and disruption to travel plans. Based on my personal experience, I strongly advise against choosing Etihad Airways for future travel plans. Their unprofessionalism, lack of customer care, and disregard for passenger well-being make them a regrettable choice for anyone seeking reliable and considerate airline service.

### "very good value for money"
I flew Etihad very recently from AMS to HKT via AUH and return from BKK to AMS via AUH. All flights in economy. All flights except the flight from BKK to AUH were on time. I booked an aisle seat for all flights and I also purchased priority access which allows you to check in at separate desk and to board the aircraft first alongside business class passengers. In my opinion this is a brilliant option becuse you avoid the rush and chaos of economy class check in and boarding. It's gives you plenty of time to stow you luggage and get ready for the flight. The boarding procedure is well organised. On board I found the seats offer enough comfort and acceptable seat pitch. Ebox system is very nice with a broad selection of movies and tv show. Live tv, including sports is available. Watched the Dutch national footbal team beat Poland. Food and beverage is of good quality. Wifi available for a decent price. On all flights I found the Cabin crew to be cheerful and helpful. The only thing I would like to add is some amenities in the lavatories. All in all very good value for money.

### "Business Class product is good"
I had flown Etihad's Boeing 787  in Business Class before, and privacy-wise, the seating is not as good as the A380. Even from my window seat, the rear seat facing passengers was clearly visible. The spacious cabin and decor looked beautiful, and the seat itself, identical to that in the A380s was very comfortable. On boarding, I was addressed by name and pointed in the direction of my seat. The usual, pre-flight drinks and hot towels followed, and pushback was on time. Soon after take off, my dinner order was taken. The dishes listed on the à la carte menu were all enticing, and I chose Salmon for starters. With a choice of four main courses, it was Prawn Biriyani, which was excellent. There was no second meal served as such, instead the 'dine on demand' meant you could order from the 'all-day dining' menu. I had their famous Steak Sandwich and a beer, which was also very good. The cosy 28-seat, 1x2x1 layout cabin (which is becoming more the industry standard) was full. Yet the flight attendants managed to briefly chat with most of us, and several times asked if I needed anything else. The new grey 'cube' bag amenity kit placed on my table looked cute, but was very basic, with a few ESPA lotions, eye shades and a dental kit. The touch screen IFE worked well, however, the choice of new movies was not that great since I last flew eight months ago. Instead, I decided to watch a couple of TV sitcoms before preparing for bed. Most of the seat and lighting adjustments could be controlled both from the side table, as well as from the small tabletop monitor. As it was a night departure, I was hoping to get some rest. Etihad provides slippers, but no PJs for a nine-hour flight. However, the large pillow, mattress pad and duvet sufficed. Adjusting the seat for a harder or softer feel also made a difference. As I sipped my nightcap of black coffee and cognac by my side, and the cabin lights dimmed, I drifted into a good four sleep. Etihad's Business Class product is good, as I have experienced it several times before.

### "nothing really to complain about"
I hadn't flown Etihad's Economy Class for a long time and wasn't exactly looking forward to a nine and a half hour flight to Abu Dhabi, an eight hour layover, and another seven hour flight back to London. The check-in and boarding process at Kansai Airport was poorly handled. It was agonizingly slow, with business class and economy passengers being moved about to different counters. At the boarding gates, unlike some flights where there are dedicated spaces for each flight, here we were crowded between two flight queues right next to each other, both boarding at the same time. One staff member was carrying a small placard walking up and down the queue, advising which group of rows could start boarding. However, the flight was only delayed by 20 minutes. The first flight on the Dreamliner has a 3x3x3 layout. The seat itself and legroom was reasonably comfortable, I guess only because I am not tall. The flight was full and the service began as soon as the seat belt sign was turned off. There were two meal services on this flight. It was sad to see how much the size of the meal tray has shrunk. The first meal ran out of choice, and I had to settle for some bland pasta. Having apologized, I was promised a choice of the second meal and the shrimp curry with rice which was delicious. Drinks were served with meals, and followed by coffee or tea afterwards. Later I was able to request an extra drink, but had to wait a long time to be served. The seat has about 3 inches recline, although mine wasn't working. Once the lights were dimmed, I did manage to nod off a for an hour or so. At Abu Dhabi, before the flight back to London, I was relieved to relax at Etihad's Business Lounge as I was a Guest Member. Boarding at Abu Dhabi was expertly handled, with clear messaging for which seating rows to come forward. On the A380 to Heathrow, I had paid for an 'extra legroom seat', which has 4 more inches of extra space, and did make a difference in comfort. Located in the front of the aircraft, and curtained off like a separate cabin, it felt more relaxing. The onboard service was of course the same as the rest in Economy class. It was a bright blue sky day as we departed on time. The interactive IFE route map showed the exterior tail camera and an excellent view of the aircraft taxing and taking off. Both flights were nothing special, and the service was as you would expect on a long-haul economy class flight. The A380 was certainly more comfortable than the Dreamliner. Although non-engaging, on both flights, the cabin crew were professional, so I have nothing really to complain about.

### "I have submitted 3 claims"
For the last 3 months I am waiting for my bag. I have submitted 3 claims, one of your member offer me very low amount which are very less to my luggage things present in it. After that no one reply my emails. I want know what i do now for my lost bag. Very Sad about Etihad response

### "Ground staff needs training"
On may 14, i came to check in and i was told I'm over nearly 2 kgs. The first lady told me i still have extra space in my cabin trolley then could make use of that. Came back 2nd time to another staff and she told me my trolley is 8 kgs and ask me if i got laptop. I said i got small laptop in my medium tote bag, she said i need to weigh your shoulder bag. I never been humiliated before, she said its 3 kgs and advised me to put that extra back to my check ins and just pay £100. To avoid further embarrassment, i agreed. Came back to counter 3rd time and this time a different ground staff said you will pay £153. Make use of that space in your cabin trolley and pay nothing. I had enough and told her i have been repacking 3x now. She apologised few times. I have been embarassed so let me pay £153 and  paid. Ground staff needs training.

### “I did enjoy it very much”
Nearly eight months ago, I took this exact flight to Abu Dhabi, and was expecting the same professional onboard service I enjoyed before. This time flying with cabin baggage only - a generous 12 kg, plus another 5kg 'handbag'. I therefore understood why they had to weigh each item on check-in. The boarding process was swift, and I was served both champagne and a lovely mint and lemon drink as soon as I settled down. Hot towels followed, and slippers were provided. Etihad's 'dine on demand' for some reason did not materialize nor was it offered. Soon after take off, and at cruising altitude, the bar service followed, and lunch was served. For the rest of the flight the à la carte 'all-day dining menu' meant I could request the next meal or snack when needed. A nice touch is that I could also order my drinks from the IFE monitor. Seat comfort adjustments, massage and lighting could be controlled both from the side table, as well as from the small tabletop monitor. If I had something to mildly grumble about, two noticeable differences compared to my previous flight was - a new but very basic ESPA amenity kit (I missed the cologne which was included in their previous Acqua di Parma products). I was also rather disappointed with the lack of more new movies, although there was plenty to choose from TV shows, documentaries, news channels and games. Later, I spent a little time at the small lounge which was empty, and helped myself to a drink at the self-service bar, and a crew member served me coffee and chocolates. Although the necessary bedding was provided, like a soft mattress, duvet and large pillow, I resisted a nap as I had a long layover ahead of me on my next flight from Abu Dhabi, and would get some sleep at their lounge. A non-eventful flight, nevertheless as before, I did enjoy it very much, especially the friendly cabin crew.

### "Never again Etihad"
This airline do not know how to handle baby strollers, we had the experience of having our double stroller damaged beyond repair and Etihad say it's not their faults, won't check with ground staff in Abu Dhabi instead try to bribe us with 50usd. We cannot just buy a new stroller now we must suffer without one. Because of airline negligence and disrespectful staff Never again Etihad.

### "allocated random seats"
Not Verified |   We pre booked specific seats in row 49 economy on a 787-10 only for an equipment change to a 787-9. Row 49 does not exist on a 787-9, so we were allocated random seats. Many emails sent requesting a refund for the 88€, all met with silence. This is basically theft.

### "Nobody care how are you"
I had two flights with connection 11 hours in Abu Dhabi, first flight they didn’t gave even food, after complaining they gave me sandwiches - I was in  business class. When I arrived to my final destination they lost my baggage, and they don’t answer and no taking any responsibility. They told me to split the baggage from the first flight. Nobody care how are you.

### "Would not recommend"
Some of the worst customer service I've ever experienced. Cancelled my flight without warning two weeks before departure, only offering alternate flights that would take 3x as long with 3x the stopovers en route, or a refund. No offer of class upgrade to make the lengthy/inconvenient journey more comfortable. No consideration of the fact that even with a refund, flights with other airlines are quite a bit more expensive so close to the departure date. Contacting their customer service department involved being on hold for ages, and then being told I would need to accept an alternate flight and then apply for compensation separately without any kind of reassurance anything would be done. Super frustrating. And you can't leave feedback with them on their website unless you've already taken your flight, so here I am. Would not recommend unless your travel plans are very flexible.

### “This was a nightmare”
This was a nightmare. The flight departed one hour late due due to the delivery of the baggages and departed even though not all of them were carried. Arriving at Narita Airport, I had no clue and waited for my baggage and claimed it after a while to the counter. The staff gave me a generic paper explaining the collant couldn’t deliver my luggage and I had to fill a form but I had no info about when, where and how would I get it back. I got it delivered 48 hours later so I had to cover the daily expenses in between. The entire situation was very stressful and spoiled my whole trip. The company was very opaque about the whole process of getting reimbursed and once I went back, I got into a loop of generic email informing they’d cover the equivalent of barely 43€ for the inconvenience. No more information, just the same email sent over and over as a response. I cannot trust them on handling the baggage issue and the customer service anymore.

### "Good riddance"
Not Verified |   Have flown Etihad now 14 years / exceptional then the decline,  gold member for 11 years and found the service in the air above par. Stayed with them through the recent bad times even though service had dropped . But now they have in their wisdom decided to overhaul their frequent flyer guest program - well to suffice another major slap in the face to their frequent loyal flyers. No upgrades, no seat availability, 4 times the miles to use, not to mention the wonderful 241 miles voucher is now only available in Jan to April - but you pay almost close to the same full fare with their taxes and most pay part cash - a blatant marketing lie . Etihad your customers in UAE are walking away and your CEO is not listening . Good riddance.

### "Never again with these people"
I was a day late with my Abu Dhabi flight to Tokyo due to an accident and travelled the next day. To my utter amazement Etihad cancelled my return flights and to cut to the chase they had to put me up in an airport hotel as my original flight was now sold out. What sort of an airline cancels a return business class flight without even letting me know. I only found out by accident when I went into manage my booking! The flights themselves were very ordinary at best, nice enough cabin crew but food poor. Never again with these people.

### "almost like a low cost airline"
This airline is almost like a low cost airline. Business class it has a normal service, almost like economy class. Terrible staff in all the four flights I made with them. Check in ok, but in the business class terminal in Abu Dhabi, service was normal, no smiles or good night. Nothing. If I request anything to eat, the answer was: ´am sorry, we don´t have this or that". The crew weren´t nice at all. It seems they were doing a favor to attend your requests. In one of the flights, in a 777, the plane was very old and it was always very hot in the cabin. Meals were average, with no good taste. Overall, I was regret choosing this airline.

### “Poor service by the airline staff”
Not Verified |  It's my first time journey with this Airline with lots of expectations. But the first journey itself ended with poor dream. Frequent change of Boarding gates after issuance of the boarding pass. This happened to me during my outward and onward journeys. This might be funny for the airline but the common passengers especially elders and women struggled a lot due to the last minute change of boarding gates. No announcement or communication about the change of flight timings. Poor communication by ground staff at Abu Dhabi airport. When enquired about the time change the airline staff gave a vague response stating check through the digital display board. No announcement by the airline even after many of the Passengers coming and complaining about the change in gate and time issues. Poor service by the airline staff. Blankets not provided by the airline. When enquired by one of the passenger, staff responded in unmannerly way stating that it will be hot after takeoff. Further staff responded that all the available blankets were already issued. Eventhough extra blankets are available in the cabin storage area.

### “no service-mind, no empathy”
This is the worst flight of my life. I got a 24hr delay on both flights of round trip. Return trip from Milan to Bangkok was 22:15, 14 Apr but have email from airline that flight delay to be 01:45 and change again to be 03:30. Ground staff at MPX gave dinner coupon but some shops were already closed, we just got sandwich and water. We cannot transfer flight to BKK (10:25 EY404) as arriving time was delayed. Then when we arrived at AUH, ground staff gave lunch coupon, only at food court then back to wait for visa to be going out to hotel as our transfer flight had been changed to tomorrow. I feel so bad about the service from ground staff, there are no apologies, no one says sorry for this happening, staff do not try to help, do not give any helpful answers. They are just saying the same robotic sentences. Some passengers asked ground staff how long they have to wait for visas but ground staff answers with “you got visa application via airline or embassy? this is not nice. The ground staff had no service-mind, no empathy. We are waiting over 7 hours at transfer area as same as the flight on 05Apr EY409 and EY85 (transfer to Rome) we had same awful situation with this bad service airline.

### “Terrible Airline!”
Terrible Airline! Bad problem solving! Bad service mind of staff. I had my flight canceled just a couple of hours before departure time and the way your airline tried to solve the problem was very slow and terrible. We had to wait 24 hours for the next flight. Staff had no service mind to help customers and the way they talked to customers was like we did not pay any money. I know that the airline don’t care, staff dared us to complain via the website. If anyone wants to use this airline think really hard.

### "awful airline, awful service"
Awful trip, awful airline, awful service. 5 hours delay communicated in 3 different emails few hours before departure. No assistance at Milan Mxp. They gave complementary drinks for the wrong bar/cafe, the one they gave was already closed. Food awful. I had to wait 1h 15m for my coach connection to Dubai, no communication, no time table, no customer service at all. Awful. Never again with Etihad.

### "I will never fly with Etihad again"
Not Verified |   I always have veg meal in flight. Osaka to Abu Dhabi was mixed sautéed green vegs with mushroom Chinese style with no rice or noodle. The salads were big chunks, butter was margarine in packets written in Japanese. The bread rolls were chewy. Abu Dhabi to London- chickpea and cauliflower, 2 tablespoon amount with small triangle shaped chapati. What on earth was that? Even the air hostess was embarassed. The other thing is why are we served food first and not drinks first? I have never seen this before. And you have to wait around 30 mins to get drinks served after the dinner. The coffee is rubbish, watery. Entertainment videos are all same in all the flights. Not many Korean dramas or music, a very bad selections. The cabin crew, some cares and some just don't communicate well. So my conclusion is I will never fly with Etihad again.

### "I would not consider Etihad"
Not Verified |   First time on Etihad from London to Osaka via Abu Dhabi and back from Seoul to London on Business Class. I had heard a lot of good things about Etihad and decided to give it a try based on the good fare. My verdict is unless the price is significantly lower than other Asian carriers, I would not consider Etihad. Booking process online was very easy and they provided many flight combinations which was a big plus. The chatbox, however, wasn’t very helpful. I tried to enquire about the arrival lounge at Abu Dhabi airport and kept getting inconsistent messages due to lack of product knowledge. Airport service in London and Abu Dhabi was great. Business class departure and arrival experience in the new Terminal A in Abu Dhabi exceeded my expectations and it was very smooth. Lounge in London Heathrow was dated but service was friendly, and F&B selection was also great. Lounge in Abu Dhabi was brand new and it’s massive. My only criticism is the layout of the lounge – you need to walk for minutes to get a glass of wine in the bar. Services in the lounge and at the gates were all friendly and professional. Once onboard, the seat was comfortable with decent amount of storage. The new table ware and duvet by Armani was of good quality. I am not a big fan of the earphone provided and the choices on the IFE are lacking. What let me down is the in flight experience. I fly long haul business class few times a year and Etihad had the worst service. Crew were not engaging and didn’t seem to be happy to do their job. Unlike any other airlines, they gave you a glass of wine and did not refill throughout the journey. They didn’t proactively ask if you need any service and there was a lack of enthusiasm. To be honest I think the economy class in Asian airlines offer much better service.

### "a poor choice for travel"
After from Bahrain to Barcelona on 25 December 2023, my suitcase (an American Tourister 28" worth about $250) was damaged by Etihad's handling team. Upon arrival, there was no Etihad help desk at Barcelona airport. The airport staff helped us file a damage report since Etihad wasn't there to assist. Normally, airlines provide a replacement right away, but we had to buy a new suitcase ourselves for €264 the next day, as shops were closed for Christmas. We sent all the paperwork to Etihad, asking for a refund. Three months later, they only offered $50 or a $75 travel voucher. They ignored our situation and showed no concern for the inconvenience caused. Etihad's customer service is terribly disappointing, making it a poor choice for travel.

### "definitely not my airline of choice"
Much better value for money when compared to competitors. The herringbone seat on their new A350 was fantastic (great privacy with screen door, comfortable lie flat bed, ergonomic storage options). Food was fine - nothing to write home about though. I was surprised that they policed what I could order after my first meal. They have an “all day menu” that one can theoretically order from throughout the flight (so no set meal times). They didn’t let me have anything else after I had a sandwich mid flight claiming they didn’t have enough to go around - this on a 12 hour flight! Entertainment options were pretty lacking too (just three episodes each of five US sitcoms for TV shows + a modest movie selection), and wifi was slow. Toilets did not seem to get cleaned very much. All in all, not bad for the price, but definitely not my airline of choice.

### "worst airline I have traveled on"
You are better off paying a few hundred quids extra on BA and getting 50 kgs checked in allowance. No point wasting time with Etihad. Absolutely the worst airline I have traveled on. They expect you to carry 7 kgs in cabin baggage for a 14 hours international journey. The baggage allowance should include your laptop, charger, any electronics (as they anyway cannot be checked in) like ipad phone headphones etc. and no personal handbag allowed. If excess the cost is 4000 per kg. Which means I might as well abandon a bag at the airport with my underwear and other toiletries, as they are definitely not worth taking. Which idiotic airline has this “no personal baggage” rule for a 14 hours international flight? No point wasting time with Etihad it’s not worth it at all. Run in the opposite direction even if they give you a free flight

### “lack of assistance and support”
Not Verified | My recent experience with Etihad Airlines was incredibly disappointing. The abrupt cancellation of our flight without clear explanations was frustrating. What made matters worse was the lack of assistance and support provided to all passengers during this ordeal, and with no guidance from the airline's staff, but this experience highlighted a significant failure in communication and customer service. I had expected better from Etihad but sadly today's experience was really very very bad.

### "Very bad service"
Canceling our flight without prior notice to all passengers is very bad. We passengers leave in different places. And then they will tell you that it's cancel.. I have a lot of things to do and it's all arrange according to my plan. We're waiting long time and this assistance is not good. Very bad service. Not ever again

### "Etihad is a con artist"
I have to fly from Johannesburg to Ahmedabad for business. I initially booked on another airline, which would have resulted in two stopovers with long connections. Etihad advertises a free one- or two-day stopover in Abu Dhabi, and I decided to take them up on the offer, as I would arrive in AUH early in the evening and depart late the next day. (18hrs 45min) I selected the free stopover box and made the booking. When I wanted to make a free hotel booking, I could not. Somewhere, hidden in the terms and conditions, three layers down, it says the offer only applies for layovers of over 24 hours. However, nowhere in the sophisticated booking process is a checksum saying, "If layover < 24 hrs, warn the guest". I called customer service to change my flight out to the next evening, which would give me a longer stay. I paid USD 30 to contact the call centre (rip-off) and paid the penalty for changing my flight. When I wanted to book the "free stopover", I could not because now they claim they had no rooms available. Now I would have to stay 28 hours at the airport. Naturally, the airline is protected by well-hidden terms and conditions. The problem is that it is not possible to verify if rooms are available unless you have a booking reference. Etihad is a con artist. They use predatory pricing, misleading advertising, and bogus offers to entrap passengers and extort additional payments. Eventually, my trip cost me nearly USD 300 more. Etihad is now blacklisted in my company,.

### ""scam if not worse"
I booked flights to BKK in September 2023 with a stop over in Abu Dhabi on the return for 6 nights. To date, March 6, 2024, my flights have been changed 4 times. The days of my holiday no longer correspond to the program but I cannot change them except with a crazy penalty because "I have already changed the flights". They changed them for me and I was forced to restore them. I cannot cancel the flight without a penalty of 60% (sixty percent) of the total cost of the ticket and I cannot change the dates. Call center staff bouncing off responsibilities, no one tells me anything even though I booked directly on their site. I would define the unfairness of this company as "scam" if not worse. They told me that if they "make" me (so them, not me) another change then I can cancel without penalty. But what are the rules? And what's more, paying for 2 passengers in Business. Ho prenotato a settembre 2023 i voli per BKK con stop over ad Abu Dhabi al ritorno di 6 notti. Ad oggi, 6 marzo 2024, mi hanno cambiato i voli 4 volte. I giorni della mia vacanza non corrispondono più al programma ma, non posso cambiarli se non con una penale pazzesca perchè "ho già modificato i voli". NON è VERO, me li hanno cambiati loro e io sono stata costretta a ripristinarli. Non posso cancellare il volo se non con una penale del 60% (sessanta percento) del costo totale del biglietto e non posso modificare le date. Personale call center che rimbalza le responsabilità, nessuno mi dice niente anche se ho prenotato direttamente sul loro sito. La scorrettezza di questa compagnia la definirei "raggiro" se non peggio. Mi hanno detto che se mi "fanno" (quindi loro, non io) un altro cambio allora posso annullare senza penale. Ma che regole sono? E per di più pagando per2 passeggeri in Business.

### “forced to be separated on-board”
Appalling customer service for business class passengers Flight 1 LHR-AUH Although we had paid a premium to select our seats together as a family of 5 (including 3 small children aged 6 and under) - we were forced to be separated on-board. We paid extra ($160USD per p) This caused the children to be extremely distressed when they were disorientated in Abu Dhabi. It also created safety concerns around leaving the children to go to the bathroom themselves on a flight of strangers. When we raised the issue with a flight attendant, they said we should have raised this with ground staff even though there is no Etihad ground staff at either Heathrow or Sydney. They simply advised we should make a “complaint” on your website showing no empathy for the situation. Flight 3 SYD-AUH 1. No fast track through security and customs was offered even though we were priority with children flying business. There was also no priority lane when checking in to our flight at the bag drop off 2. The lounge was at capacity in Sydney and no food or drinks were available. We were declined access. 3. One TV screen did not work the entire time. A wifi code was offered that did not work. A glaring light was coming from the screen making it difficult to sleep to which the staff put a blanket over it. 4. The staff ran out of basic snacks such as crisps which is not what you expect from a business class flight. Flight 4 AUH-LHR 1. No priority to people with children or business class when going through security 2. Again we faced the same issue when we were boarding the flight due to a lack of communication from ground staff. There was no priority for business passengers or those with children (nothing we were both) 3. Again one seat did not have a working screen, this time it was a seat that was an individual one, not a part of a pair meaning a 6 year old and 5 year old were sitting by themselves with no adult supervision or help during meal time. We spent significant money ensuring the children were supported throughout the flight and it is appalling that for BOTH flights one screen did not work. 4. The three children were not offered meals on the 14 hour flight. No one spoke to the parents/ guardians and we needed to question the staff on the orders. By the time this was done, they did not have any meals available. I am not sure how you can board a flight without enough food for all passengers. Avoid this airline at all costs. I have submitted a complaint and asked for a refund for the $800 we spent to sit as a family and simply been ignored. There is no complaints process or escalation process. This airline is completely unregulated and have no customer service even if you are a silver member.

### "it is now pointless being loyal"
Not Verified |  As general feedback the new airport is a huge step forward than the older terminal. But this appears to have impacted not only the ground service but the flight service. Staff are all clearly new or either have taken on an air of supremacy - service is cold - snappy - arrogant. Gold and platinum members are now never recognised and it is now pointless being loyal as they have trebled the miles needed and never have upgrade seats available on any routes for months. Keep it up - the reviews speak from themselves. I’ll move to Qatar Airways with better service and which appreciate loyalty. This new CEO arrogance is evident with the attitude and miserable personalities and attitude of the staff - after 14 years as a gold member - good bye !

### "much less then unprofessional"
Not Verified | Review is for a flight due February 14, 2024. The service of call center is much less then unprofessional and should need a - (minus) before the stars. Call to Italy and 2 from Abu Dhabi to get apologies but none is interested in solving their own problems or give a kind of compensation. I am a gold member of this airline and give you an advise, stay away because if you have any kind of problem, (caused by yourself or by them), none will be willing to help, unless you pay of course!

### "Service was horrible"
I am commenting only Abu Dhabi to Sydney route EY454 17 Jan 2024. Me, my wife and my daughter travelled business class. Service was horrible. Ordered meals and some drinks to a tall bearded steward. Meals came drinks forgotten. This guy seemed to be ashamed of his job and thinks too big for himself. Later I ordered some drinks and a girl promptly delivered it but not even a packet of peanut. Similarly my daughter ordered some water from this same guy and it never came till such time she asked him if there is a water shortage.

### "service is really sub-par"
The service is really sub-par and the dietary options in 2024 are ten years behind other airlines. I had no working entertainment console for a 14.5 hour flight and no meal options due to a shortage of vegetarian options. In total I paid 1.7K to fly with them and felt really short-changed!

### "given three different seats"
I want to express my thanks to the wonderful crew on the Abu Dhabi to Kolkata flight, especially Nadia, Maryam, Makbool, and Sahid. I had talked to Etihad Airways customer care earlier and booked my daughter's ticket through them. I asked to link her ticket with my wife's, and they assured me. I also booked wheelchair assistance for my wife, and it was provided. When I inquired about special assistance at the airport, they said the ground staff would be helpful. However, when I reached the airport today and requested special assistance for check-in due to my wife's inability to stand in queues, there were challenges. I was told to wait in a chair, but others who arrived later were checked in before me. Despite my efforts to seek assistance from ground staff, it wasn't provided until Maria intervened. A supervisor named Pathini then rudely insisted I go back to the end of the regular line. After a brief argument, I was allowed through a different line near the business class. At the counter, I encountered staff who was unprofessional and insisted all luggage be separate. This was contrary to my previous experiences, where our family's luggage was accepted together. Despite explaining my situation, she refused to accept my wife and daughter's hand luggage in the total weight, causing confusion and frustration. I eventually had to give a 14 kg bag to someone else, and then requested seats together for my wife and daughter. Despite prior assurances from customer care, I was given three different seats. I am currently facing the issue of my luggage being stuck in Doha

### "Very rude ground staff"
Very rude ground staff of Etihad Airways at Ahmedabad Airport. Inflight staff was good. This staff humiliates to passengers. This feedback is latest when my Daughter was traveling this Airline on 29.12.2023 thru EV 285 Flight.

### "Terrible unfortunate experience"
Terrible unfortunate experience. Never encountered such inexperienced and incompetent ground staff. But being inexperienced and incompetent is one thing and being curt and arrogant is another. That is uncalled for and simply unacceptable. Couldn’t wait to get away from the toxic environment. Firstly, for unknown reason when I arrived to check in my seat for unjustified reason was put on stand by. After the employee called the aircraft that issue was solved of course still no explanation and then followed one incompetence after the other. Having compassion for the lady I stayed patient and calm but when her colleague but as her colleague started becoming so rude and talking to me in an aggressive, rude and incomprehensible manner, that’s when I asked him his name as he wasn’t wearing a badge but of course he didn’t give his name. It’s so unfortunate and disappointing to be treated in such a curt and aggressive manner by an airline employee.

### "exploitative baggage policies"
While the in-flight service on Etihad Airways was quite decent, the service on the ground and the issues with the app/website, along with their exploitative baggage policies make this airline one that I would never fly with again. I had an economy class ticket but paid for an upgrade to Business Class for the second leg of the flight. I had attempted numerous times prior to this flight to add an extra checked bag via the airline's website as well as the Etihad app, and each time I tried to do so there was an error asking me to try again later. As a result, I ended up having to check the bag at the airport. When I got to the airport and tried to explain my situation, I was told that because I didn't book the bag online (keep in mind that I literally couldn't) the charge would be higher - I ended up having to pay 2,860 SAR ($1083.41 CAD) to check one 20kg bag. This was more than the cost of buying an entirely separate economy class ticket, and was the case despite me having paid to upgrade to Business Class for the second leg of the flight. In addition to this, the Etihad staff at Riyadh airport handwrote an additional fee onto the receipt and refused to provide me with baggage tags unless I also paid the extra fee, without any explanation for why they added it on. The check-in agent specifically noted that I "should have picked a different airline" if I wanted all of the fees to be actually printed on the receipt. When I spoke with Etihad staff in Abu Dhabi regarding the same issue, they told me that it was essentially my fault the website and app didn't work properly, and that I "didn't really have a choice but to pay all the fees which is too bad". I filed a complaint with Etihad Airways the same day as my flight (when I asked staff what the contact information was for the airline to do so, they told me that I "should know how to use Google"). They eventually wrote back two weeks later, with the following reply: -- "Please note that The excess baggage can only be issued on Etihad flights and where itineraries involve other airlines excess baggage can be purchased at the airport We appreciate your understanding regarding this matter. -- This reply is not applicable to my situation at all, given that all of my flights were flown by Etihad Airways (as can be confirmed on my attached boarding passes), and the ticket was booked directly with Etihad Airways and not with a third party. I replied to this message, and have had only radio silence since November 24, 2023. I therefore feel that I have given Etihad Airways more than a reasonable timeframe to reply to my concerns prior to posting this review. I should mention that the in-flight service by the crew on both flights was excellent, particularly in Business Class from AUH-DUB, where the crew was pleasant, attentive, and caring. The A350-1000 was also a very clean and quiet plane, although the A320 from RUH-AUH was a bit dated. Ultimately, if it wasn't for the incredibly rude and condescending way I was treated on the ground (both in Riyadh and Abu Dhabi), plus the lack of acknowledgement by the airline that the app and website have significant issues (ultimately I have penalized immensely for Etihad's technical problems), I would have rated the airline much better.

### "Will never fly Etihad again"
Not Verified |  The worst business flight I had in 2023. Despite purchasing a business class ticket from Etihad for a full flat all aisle access we were downgraded to a Wamos aging A330 with broken seat, broken, IFE system, appalling IFE content and terrible food. Total disgrace. Will never fly Etihad again.

### "a shocking level of negligence"
Having arrived on 17.09.2023 from Dallas Fort Worth to Ahmadabad, my ordeal began when I discovered my wheelchair missing. What ensued over the last 3 months has been a frustrating odyssey of failed attempts at resolution, highlighting a shocking level of negligence and insensitivity on the part of Etihad Airways. Despite my relentless efforts to communicate and seek a resolution, each attempt has been met with silence. As an individual with a disability, my wheelchair is not a mere convenience; it is a fundamental necessity for my mobility. The loss of this crucial aid has disrupted my daily life in ways beyond comprehension. My presentation of an option to Etihad Airways suggesting the expedited purchase of a replacement wheelchair has yielded no tangible results. I extend a cautionary note to potential travelers, urging them to exercise careful consideration before choosing Etihad Airways. The evident lack of concern for my predicament is not just an isolated incident; it reflects a broader pattern of neglect and apathy towards customer service.

### "I have not received my refund"
I purchased Etihad return ticket through cleartrip for departure date 25 June 2023. A few days prior to travel, I randomly checked online on Etihad website and couldn’t find my ticket. Thinking it may be temporary error and tried checking again after one or two days and it returned same – that my ticket wasn’t getting displayed on Etihad website. Finally I called the airline to check what was the issue and they said the flight is cancelled. I was shocked as nobody informed me (either email or sms) about cancellation. Immediately I applied for full refund of the ticket value and till now I have not received my refund. I have made dozens of calls and they give so lame excuses. Today they came with another excuse – that my refund was rejected. The reason they say that my ticket is still showing active on their website. I am more than frustrated with this airline’s pity state of affair. I will never ever travel with this airline even if they offer free ticket, but also I will urge other people to exercise extreme caution if you happen to chose this airline.

### "did not have extra legroom"
My wife, 2 kids (4 years and 3 months old) were flying with me from Toronto to Doha. They were on a separate booking than me, so I paid extra money to have seats next to them. I paid for extra legroom seats at 23C aisle seat. The staff had moved my wife and kids away from row 23 and moved them to row 43. When I asked them to put them back on the seats we had selected in row 23 by calling Etihad airways customer service, they refused. As such they changed my seat to row 45 which did not have extra legroom and was a middle seat. Etihad went about boarding in Toronto with business first zone 1, 2, 3 and then came to us. I asked a few times that with children long lines are difficult for them, is there a family line and I was told there was none. We had four carry on for all four of us and had put it in the seats above us. While re-arranging others bags, the flight attendant whose bag is this to which I said it was mine. She took it out and gave it to me and said we have to put other peoples bags even though it was right above our seat. I said the leg space is already less and we have just put one carry on and not multiple like some other people, but she just left. For the 13 hr flight, not only did I get my extra leg space, I had my one carry on forced onto me to put under the seat in front of me. When we landed in Abu Dhabi we waited for the stroller to be given at the airline gate, we were told the we can only get the stroller in Doha and to ask for a stroller at the Abu Dhabi airport. We asked around waited for 30 minutes and no stroller was found at the Abu Dhabi airport. When it came time to board the Abu Dhabi flight, the same issue of not having a specified line was prevalent. When our boarding pass was scanned, I reached the bus gate and it was packed, so I asked the Etihad personnel to open the bus behind us which was empty. He instead led us to the same bus to the third bus door asking people to make space for us. There was no space to be made. The passengers in the bus were kind enough to see my wife holding a 3 month old baby and gave up their seats for her. The touchscreen for your entertainment screen from the Toronto to Abu Dhabi was extremely error prone and we mostly had to use handsets to manouvre the options around. I fly Qatar airways and they board people who need assistance and families sometimes even before business class. Doubtful anything will change after this post, I wish you luck in trying to be a fair and inclusive airline.

### “left a lasting negative impression”
Not Verified |  My experience with Etihad Airways, particularly at the check-in counter with Imran, was regrettably disappointing. Imran exhibited a concerning lack of flexibility and subjected me to the unnecessary inconvenience of weighing my handbag, an unusual and unwarranted practice in my extensive flying history. Moreover, the ordeal continued as he insisted on charging more for baggage fees than seemed justified, consistently rejecting the option to pay for an extra piece of luggage and instead emphasizing additional kilos. As a frequent flyer, my first encounter with Etihad left a lasting negative impression. Imran's meticulous scrutiny of grams, seemingly aimed at extracting every possible fee, was both frustrating and unprecedented in my travels. Unfortunately, this experience has left me with a strong reluctance to choose Etihad Airways for future flights. The emphasis on financial gains over customer service has significantly diminished my confidence in the airline.

### "Unexpected fees and lack of clarity"
When I bought a business class ticket from Lisbon to Bangkok, I expected comfort and all the perks of expensive tariffs. However, when I wanted to change the date of my return flight, I was surprised: instead of $30, they charged me $700 euros. Explanations about "fare rules" left a lot of questions. Even the support couldn’t clearly say where the fee comes from. All they said was “the website calculates it like this”. Unexpected fees and lack of clarity is something you don't expect from business class. I recommend weighing your choices before flying business with Etihad.

### "can only be described as chaotic"
The cabin experience was fine and on par with other airlines. Consequently, this review is primarily regarding Ground/Back Office Operations. It has taken the Airlines more than 2 months and multiple contacts and misdirection to inform me that I need to contact American Airlines to claim Frequent Flier miles, in spite my having specified my AA number on the reservation! There appears to be very little coordination between Etihad and Abu Dhabi Customs in terms of disallowed items et al and I was detained for carrying clearly labelled medications, threatened with imprisonment and fined. Needing my medication, I visited a medical institution in Abu Dhabi, and paid for a doctors's consultation and a prescription! My subsequent flight to JFK was delayed by a whole day but the way the Airline handled Hotel and transport for the delayed passengers can only be described as chaotic.

### "the worst customer service"
The return flight from Athens to Singapore had a 9+ hours layover in Abu Dhabi, Etihad unilaterally changed the time of departure twice and since the last move exceeded the 10 hours, by airline policy I was supposed to be entitled to a complimentary hotel night stay. Of course, the airline never informed me that I was entitled to this, but I was able to contact the live chat service and ask whether I was entitled to it indeed they answered and gave me a set of instructions on how to complete the reservation prepaid by Etihad. The process was way harder than it should have, but I finally manage to get the confirmation email of the hotel. Etihad is already struggling to meet expectations at this point. On the night of the flight, I land in Abu Dhabi after a 7 hours flight, catch the taxi to the hotel at midnight and to my horror I am told that I have a reservation, but it has been cancelled by Etihad - I remain in disbelief but the hotel confirms this, I fire up my laptop and look for the Etihad chat service, it takes a lot of hurdles to speak with a human but I finally manage. It may as well been a robot: "HI my name is XXX XXX, how can I help you? and from there it proceeds to tell me that the reservation was cancelled as the company later realized that I didn't meet new criteria that they never mentioned before for the free hotel booking, and that a different department decided to cancel it after it was already booked, except I was never notified. The staff at the hotel was super kind and understanding, even offered me the same preferential conditions as Etihad, but the price for the night would have been 3X the normal price at this point. I told the Etihad operator that I would be spending the rest of the night shaming their bad practices on this like this one if they had not done anything at all to make up for the mistake, which was clearly their fault, and I'm here to keep that promise. They used to have good quality service and planes, but the airline has turned into trash post covid under all aspects - this was no doubt the worst customer service experience of my life.

### "Worst experience ever"
Not Verified |  Worst experience ever. Old aircraft, many personal screens not working properly, usb plug in for charging phones etc not working, service not great. But the worst of all: luggage was delayed. Was easy to put in a claim for money spent for urgent needed items until the luggage arrived, then the tedious work started: links they sent re the claim weren’t working and emails didn’t have clear instruction. I was forced to sign up as a guest member to go ahead with the claim. Difficult to find phone numbers to contact them directly, then no one answered, even not the option to leave a voice mail. They sent emails from email accounts which were no longer valid when sending an answer a few hours later, no indication which email to use for them so ended up having a minimum of 4 different email addresses and none of them seem to have been the correct one. All in all, many emails had to be sent, weren't answered detailed, but in a standard way. The whole process took 3 months. I will never fly with them again!

### "forced to check my small hand luggage"
Ridiculous rude staff. I would not recommend this airline. The ground staff was the worst. I was forced to check my small hand luggage as it was just over 7kg.

### "not recommended at all"
Not Verified |  The worst airline company I have ever seen, they lost my luggage after my flight from Istanbul to Abu Dhabi on the 20th August, and now it is the 26th of October still with no answer. I followed all the procedures that needed to be followed, I called their useless customer/ luggage center on a daily basis, but nothing much has changed. The only thing they can say is that we email the officer and they are going to contact you as soon as possible. After 21 days of waiting for the luggage to be located or traced, you will need to start a new long journey of 28 days waiting for them scratching their heads to think about the reimbursement amount. Once they decide to reimburse you( a set of money that doesn't cover even one-third the value of your luggage), you have to fill out a PDF full of abbreviations. Here, the journey of replying to their emails and spending decades waiting for their reply starts. Once you decide to call them, they will reply in a disrespectful way saying that the process takes 30 days for the money transfer to be reflected on your account. Overall, I will never travel on that airline and it is not recommended at all.

### "the service was excellent"
Having recently enjoyed a great time on Etihad's A380, I was looking forward to the flight on the newly refurbished Boeing 787 . However, at Bangkok Airport, the check-in desks were probably the worst I've encountered. The two business class desks looked plain and unwelcoming. There were two dirty worn-out pieces of carpet, bearing the word 'business', that were a sorry sight. The woman at the check-in desk would not smile or even utter a word of greeting. Instead, simply went through the process of passport check and handed me the boarding pass. I had to ask for a voucher for the lounge, to which she replied 'OK' and proceeded to find one and hand it to me. I was disappointed, as a few rows back the Thai Airlines counters were all gorgeous looking, with floral decorations and clean. The business class cabin looked beautiful, and the colours soothing. The cabin crew were smiling and welcomed me, I was served with champagne and hot towel and wished a good flight. The seat design is the same as in the A380. Wide and comfortable, with options to adjust for a harder or softer feel. Also provided was a large pillow, soft mattress and duvet. On the side table was an Acqua di Parma amenity kit. The storage compartment on the side of the seat contained the headphones, water bottle and space for storing smaller items. The IFE was very easy to use. Though not a great number of new movies, there was enough I think to satisfy everyone. The flight to Abu Dhabi was with a stop in Phuket to pick up more passengers. Therefore during the short one hour flight, I was served with drinks and a selection of tiny morsels of finger food. Asked whether I enjoyed it, I replied 'I don't know what it all was, but it tasted damn good'. Once the rest of the passengers boarded at Phuket and hot towels were given, pre-departure drinks were served. I opted for a delicious mint drink, and soon we were on our way, on time, to Abu Dhabi. Mohammed, the Cabin Manager, was exceptionally obliging and engaging with passengers in the nearly full 28-seat cabin. Other crew members were taking dinner orders. With the 'dine on demand' service, I decided to have my dinner as soon as possible, to get some sleep. I omitted any starters and went for the main course of braised rib steak, followed by a cheese board. A turndown service was offered. However, I managed to set up the mattress myself and, following a coffee and cognac, I settled for a two hour sleep and was woken up as requested two-hours before arrival. The cabin crew came around speaking to awake passengers, and checking if they needed anything. Overall the service was excellent. My only wee complaint is, as in night flights, providing pyjamas would have added that extra comfort to an otherwise perfect flight experience.

### "I was on a memorable flight"
It was good to see Etihad had brought back its A380 fleet especially on the London to Abu Dhabi route. I built up much anticipation for my upcoming flights. From the speedy and friendly check-in to the comfortable lounge, and being addressed by name on boarding, I felt I was on a memorable flight. The upper deck has both forward and rear-facing seating referred to as business studios. I had selected a forward-facing window seat, which also has additional storage bins by the windows. The seat felt very comfortable with options to adjust for a harder or softer feel. Also provided was a large pillow, soft mattress and duvet. On the side table was an Acqua di Parma amenity kit. The storage compartment on the side of the seat contained the headphones, water bottle and space for smaller items. Following the usual pre-flight champagne and hot towels, the cabin crew came around to take orders for lunch. I found the 'dine on demand' concept especially useful. In addition, an à la carte 'all day menu' enables you to order quite a tempting selection of items like a steak sandwich, salads, cheeses and crackers and ice cream. Soon after take off, the bar service began, and I settled for a JD on ice which was served with warm nuts. One crew member invited me to the small lounge, (which can seat up to six passengers), and have a light snack and more drinks before my late lunch. And it was served on time, with a delicious Arabic Meze for starters, and stone sea bass for the main course. The Chardonnay served, followed the etiquette of showing the bottle, and tasting before pouring, which I appreciated. The IFE was very easy to use. Though not a great number of first-run movies, there was something to satisfy everyone. What I did come across was that you could order drinks from the bar through your IFE - something I had not come across before. On the return red-eye flight, I did manage to get some sleep. My one slight disappointment was no pyjamas were provided. The cabin crew were excellent, checking up on me, engaging in short chats, and offering to top up my drinks. While the hard product on most airlines' long-haul business class is good, what makes a good flight a great flight is the onboard service. And here, Etihad are on the top of their game.

### “excellent service”
Our two flights with Etihad were smooth and reasonably enjoyable for a 27-hour journey. Etihad check-in staff were friendly and made an effort to resolve problems. However, we did not appreciate the moneygrubbing attitude of the airline in restricting carry-on to a single piece: difficult with anyone with a laptop. Cabin staff were efficient, welcoming and gave excellent service. Meals were tasty, with ample portions available. We appreciated it that they were served in a timely manner: no waiting for hours after take-off. The airline provided a kit for the first overnight flight, with eye-mask, earplugs, sanitisers and toothbrush: this was very much appreciated. Entertainment channel was good, with a fairly wide selection, although short on European movies and music. Transit through Abu Dhabi was a negative, with long queues in compulsory screening. The Al-Dhabi lounge at Abu Dhabi is not to be recommended: more like a student mensa, with crowds of passengers and limited seating. Disembarkation and luggage collection went smoothly.

### “extremely unhappy with the service”
I am extremely unhappy with the service I received today. I was unaware as I booked through a travel agent that I was not allowed a handbag and a carry on. What airline does not allow this? I’ve never heard of this before. I was a solo student traveling and the manager at Manchester airport was extremely rude and unhelpful to me. Her words when I was crying of stress was “either you throw your belongings away, pay £600 or miss you flight but you better hurry up because check in closes in 5 minutes”. That is the same price as my entire flight. I eventually threw whatever I could away (this being school books) as that’s all I could and got it down to 9kgs which then cost me £480. I am furious. That was my entire holiday spending money spent on a carry on bag. Please tell me how this is ok? A friend told me they flew Lufthansa last week and paid £100 for an entire 23kg extra back. I paid x5 that for a small 9kgs bag that could fit in the overhead. I will never fly Etihad again and I will make sure everyone I know does not either. This is daylight robbery and just completely unacceptable.

### “try any of the other carriers first”
Etihad continue to fly the old 777 ancient and uncomfortable aircraft. You'll get an A380 with a proper screen seats and meal on a 7 hour flight from London and then have to endure one of the worst seats with no screens attached and worst food you can find for 5 hours. Don't do it, try any of the other carriers first.

### "I’m really disappointed"
I booked with Etihad so i could experience Etihad. Instead on my flight to Jakarta i got a service on par with a low cost airline. To begin with at online checkin you try selling me a business class product that you knew you could not provide. You also try to sell me an empty seat/row that you also knew you could not provide. I was only able to partially do online check in. The checkin agent could not move me to a window seat, even though when i boarded there was one available two rows behind. When i arrived to Abu Dhabi had to use the transfer service desk. The person who printed off my boarding passed lied to me telling i had a window seat. The boarding process at Abu Dhabi, no speaker system, and no zoning system. Once onboard i found my seat, in the middle of the aircraft in front of the toilets, it was extremely warm and uncomfortable. The row either side of the toilets are known to be the worst seats on any airline, due to the queues and the noise from the flush. I asked to change seats but apparently they’re was a 100% load factor on the flight. Was provided an extremely small snack as the first meal. On both flights the trolley for the drinks only came pass twice These been no explanation in the change of equipment and I’m really disappointed.

### "really poor and disappointing experience"
I just traveled from Singapore to Abu Dhabi on an Etihad B787, row 15. I was excited to fly Etihad as online and through their marketing it looked like a great airline but my experience was far from it, and the sad thing is the staff didn't care. First we took off 75m late. We boarded on time and only 30mins after take off time did the pilot say we had a problem that was fixed and we would be leaving soon, we taxied towards the runway and the pilot stopped the plane and said the fault re appeared so we were stopping. We stopped for 20 or so mins then started moving back the same direction we came from with no further announcement by the pilot until another 25 mins later after a very slow taxi to the most remote runway in Singapore he announced to the cabin crew to prepare for takeoff. The pilot didn't make the normal post take off announcement and we only heard from the flight crew when we were landing so the care and attention about their passengers was poor with no info what was happening. On board the plane felt like it was falling apart, tray tables were dirty, all the pockets containing things like the safety on board card were all falling apart (see photo), the seats wouldnt recline properly the crew didn't care. We were with our baby and were not offered a basinett even though we were in a basinett seat and the staff refused to help us collect rubbish from the floor to throw away when they came around to collect rubbish and we were trying to deal with 2 children. They said quite rudely to give them the rubbish and then just walked off leaving it there because they didn't want to reach down to collect it. I gave feedback to one staff member who just looked at me blankly. We had to deplane via stairs and a bus, Etihad deplaned all business class first leaving us stood outside in the heat with a baby waiting for a bus as they wouldn't put us on a half empty business class bus. Overall a really poor and disappointing experience, certainly not customer first.

### "never book flights with Etihad again"
Our luggage was damaged during the flight from Singapore to Vienna. One suitcase had a rubber band covering the zip torn and the second suitcase had a support foot broken off. At the airport in Vienna, there were no Etihad counters where this could be reported. You can only make an online report. We reported the incident and sent a photo of the damage. Etihad replied that the damage was only minor and that they would not cover the costs (repair or new purchase). This means that we have to pay for the repair ourselves, which is simply an impertinence. Regarding the flight itself, it has to be said that the seating comfort in economy class is miserable. I have never felt so cramped on any other flight. The airport in Abu Dhabi is the next point of criticism. The flight was operated with a Boeing 787-9 and was handled at a gate where there were seats for a maximum of 100 people. The remaining 200 people had to stand until boarding started. The transfer to the aircraft was done by bus, which led to a lengthy check-in process. We will never book flights with Etihad again.

### "Worst experience with Etihad"
Worst experience with Etihad today. I got multiple emails saying that I upgraded to Business Class. In fact, I was at HYD airport they informed me that my ticket was upgraded to Business Class,  after seconds they waited for 2 hours and they said its canceled again. What a stupid company these guys are running. What the hell they are doing until the last minute. I was prepared from home that I upgraded to Business Class and what a disappointment. I ended up paying more for my luggage and ended up sitting in Economy class.

### "thought they were pretty good"
Not Verified |  I actually thought they were pretty good. Friendly crew on both flights and they didn't get irritated with me when I got onto the second flight and immediately asked for water before they'd even boarded the plane. Nice staff. Unfortunately one of my bags didn't arrive and I was told it didn't leave London so that's probably the fault of Heathrow baggage handlers. It's supposed to arrive at my hotel today, fingers crossed!

### "Worse than budget airlines"
Worst service. Flight time is 2pm midday, but no A/C either in passenger bus or in flight. All passengers are sitting in hot conditions. Worse than budget airlines!

### Etihad Airways customer review
I have now been fighting with Etihad for a refund on my return ticket from Athens to Melbourne on 15/08/22 for more than one year. Despite the ticket being fully refundable and receiving email correspondence from the airline that the refund will be deposited within my account within 7 to 45 days, this has not happened. I have made countless phone calls which last more than one hour due to staff incompetence, placed on hold endlessly and many promises that the refund will be made verbally and in writing via email and on your chat support site, and this still has not occurred. I will never fly with Etihad again. Customer Service is an absolute disgrace and eventually customers like me just give up because it becomes not worth the fight.

### "exceptional experience"
I recently had the pleasure of flying with Etihad Airways and must say it was an exceptional experience from start to finish. One of the key reason for this was the outstanding service provided. From the moment I boarded the plane, I was greeted with a warm smile and made me feel instantly at ease. Throughout the flight, their professionalism and dedication to passenger comfort were truly remarkable. Their friendly and courteous demeanor created a positive atmosphere on board, making the journey exceptionally enjoyable. I am grateful for their outstanding efforts.

### "were hoping to get at least service with a smile"
Not Verified |  Flight EY16 on 12 Sep. Tickets were not cheap, £1500 Manchester to Doha for 2 people in the heat season. Seats were narrow with no legroom to give a reasonable comfort. We were hoping to get at least a nice service with a smile. Forget that. Flight attendants were murdy, some were not even looking straight at passengers, some during disembarkment looked like they were involved in solving a psychological problem of their own. The only bright star was a Moroccan female flight attendant Khadija, who was smiling on board. (I hope the airline will not punish her for that.) On my flight back to Manchester via Abu Dhabi (from Doha) we missed the first leg of the trip due to my wife’s illness and the Dubai Etihad headquarters offered to reschedule for £824 (an hour long flight!) while at the same the available ticket on skyscanner.net went for £86. Our hotel manager had to shout at them in a rude manner to make them realise they were so wrong and unprofessional in their attitude and eventually offer a free rebooking for a later flight. So, in conclusion, where am I with my dealings with Etihad? I feel badly serviced for a price and successful in escaping a rip-off in an emergency situation.

### "they don’t have any consistency"
My flight from JFK to Abu Dhabi on, August 4th 2023 was outstanding, flying first time in business class with this airline, was a great experience. But coming back on September 4th from Abu Dhabi to JFK, was a bizarre experience, it felt that 13 hours journey like never ending, as everything with this airline in business class was completely upside down, even to ask a drink was a crime, food was worst and upon checking with the crew, found out it was a new menu. Please do not spend your hard earned money on this Airline, as they don’t have any consistency.

### "Worst airline I have ever used"
Etihad staff member lost my husbands passport at check in. We handed our passports to the Etihad staff member at the check in desk. She checked in our luggage and gave us boarding passes. When she gave us our passports one passport was missing. We immediately told her this and called the manager and airport police. We told them to check the airport cameras so we could find out where the passport had been misplaced. They refused to help us and did not allow my husband to fly. I had to fly back home alone and he had to stay in transit and go through unbelievable measures to apply for a temporary passport. After this they found his passport but have not offered to pay for damages or even apologise for being so irresponsible and unprofessional with such an important document. Worst airline I have ever used.

### "brace yourself for being downgraded"
If you think seat downgrading does not exist? It does exist with Etihad flights. Not only were our seats downgraded from Economy space to Economy, while obviously paying for economy space, we then received the only broken entertainment seats of the plane for a 14h flight. Etihad staff just passed us on from checkin staff to gate staff to transit staff without one person being interested in our matter. Pleasure now dealing with the phone customer service for a refund. If you can avoid flying with Etihad do it, otherwise brace yourself for being downgraded while paying the higher price.

### "The worst service"
The worst service and horrific baggage handling practices! This was a round trip. It started well on the way to our holiday with a relatively good service. It all changed on the flight home to Melbourne. Our flight was delayed. We were forced to wait at an enclosed gate location without water nearby, after they forced us to throw out our water over 100 ml. By the time we boarded, we were dehydrated with a headache. The aircraft staff was busy and dismissive. Shortly after locating my seat, I discovered that it was wet smelling like urine. It took my fellow passenger going directly to one of the staff for them to actually address my wet seat and replace it. The troubles didn't stop there, as the crew seemed to neglect air conditioning and we flew for 13 hours in an approximately 30-35 degree Celsius cabin. The food was questionable. The cabin crew was mainly dismissive during the flight and I simply needed to go in person to the galley to get some water. The worst part was receiving my newly purchased suitcase (Samsonite) damaged. I approached the Etihad arrivals desk for help and was assured that they will cover the costs of repair or replacement. Pictures of the damages were taken and a damage report was issued. I went to repair my suitcase, and lodged a claim to get reimbursed. The baggage damage team till this day refuses to take any responsibility for the damages their airline personnel caused to my new suitcase, deeming the damages as "minor". Any request to clarify how a $110 repair is considered minor was met with "the case is closed, we are sorry you are not happy with this outcome". This is the airline I will definitely avoid at all cost!

### "The airline has no morals"
Not Verified |  They take your money and do not offer the service you have paid for. We booked extra space seats and neighbour free seats, they were happy to take our money. They gave the neighbour free seat to another person and we have paperwork to prove this, when we got on the plane, the economy space seats were economy. This happened on both legs, the cabin managers, said it happens daily and Etihad do not care. We have tried contacting them and even sent a recorded delivery, which they signed for. It was only when we did a charge back through the bank that they disputed things. How, I have no idea, we have pictures of the seats being incorrect, we have invoices, e:mails, paperwork galore and till they deny doing anything wrong. The airline has no morals, they do not care about reviews, complaints or anything, they do not care how much they ruin your holiday, but trust me I tell everyone who I know wants to travel with them, and working in the travel industry, this is a lot of people never to fly with them.

### "standard of catering has really dropped"
Decided to try Etihad again after several years as they were offering a great business class deal to South Africa. A380 service to Abu Dhabi was rather disappointing given all the hype and advertising, seating in the upper deck is claustrophobic and cramped. The on board lounge falls significantly short of the Emirates product, it is dark, gloomy and rather depressing. The standard of the catering has really dropped too, even the champagne is almost undrinkable. Amenity kit is a waste of time too, the fancy leather pouch was the most useful thing about it. On board service was indifferent and quite rushed. Despite the attractive pricing I doubt that Etihad will see me again any time soon.

### "return was a nightmare from hell"
I traveled from Heathrow to Chennai in India. The outbound trip was reasonably comfortable. The only fault I could find was the choice of food ran out by the time the food got to me on the second leg. The return was a nightmare from hell. For some unknown reason the airlines booked me with sister airline Air Arabia. The flight was late by 3 hours. I missed my connecting flight at Abu Dhabi. The put me in a sleeping lounge the size of a prison cell with bunk bed. I had to walk twice to the transit desk who was very rude to ask them to send a email to the sleeping lounge to get accommodation. No washroom was provided and one had to find it in the airport. Food voucher was provided. There was no choice and it was unpalatable I ended up buying my own and most travelling with me did the same.

### "Avoid this airline, if possible"
The worst airline on earth. They lost my luggage and were not able to forward it to me within 2 weeks of time. Worst customer service ever. No one cares and no one is trying to help you. Very hard to reach or to get a respond. Now, I finally got my suitcase after my holiday is over and Etihad refuses to pay compensation for the stuff I had to buy on my holiday location. Avoid this airline, if possible.

### "will avoid Etihad in the future"
Not Verified |  I have lost my open tickets for roughly 3000 EUR as I faced issue in the rebooking process. Neither the app or the customer service is at the expected level to assist you properly before and after. I had similar situation with a lowfare company called Cebu Pacific and process was smooth and easy. Customer team responded within 24 hours and resolve my issue Fare from Etihad is 2 to 3 times higher but service is not. Very disappointed and will avoid Etihad in the future.

### "Very bad experience"
Not Verified |  Very bad experience. Was under the impression that this was a premium airline. But this was worse than a budget airline. No screens or entertainment systems Horrible horrible food Shortage of food. Most people didn't get what they wanted. No direct exit to the terminal even for their flagship airport in Abu Dhabi. Dont care attitude of staff.

### "with very good impression"
We flew back for Paris back to Bangkok after our wonderful trip in Europe, this time with very good impression. The B787 of flight EY32 on August 23, 2023 was quite new, the boarding was quite efficient and fast. The flight attendants (both female and male) greeted us with big smile. We were served by two female flight attendants, Leena and Sayaka who were very friendly, helpful and excellent service mind. Both of them had to deal with a number of babies (who were very naughty and moving around and of course some of them crying almost all the time) and they did perfectly. Leena and Sayaka always asked us about the drinks and also told us to keep seatbelt fasten for safety. The food was quite delicious and serve well. Although flight EY408 from Abu Dhabi to Bangkok the cabin staff were quite good but the attention and service cannot be compared with the previous flight mentioned above.

### "We expected more for a premium airline"
We took a trip to Europe by flying Etihad Airways which is second time in many years. The EY 409 flight for Bangkok to Abu Dhabi by Boeing 787 was uneventful. The plane is quite new and the flight attendants (female) is OK and quite friendly. We did not have food served due to our rest. The plane arrived on time. However, the next flight EY85 from Abu Dhabi to Rome was different. The flight attendant (male) was quite unresponsive and not quite friendly. He served passengers with no smile just as he was doing his job. The food was OK and the flight was smooth and arrived a little ahead of schedule. We expected more for a premium airline like Etihad Airways but quite disappointed (my friends who travel with us share the same feeling).

### "Worst experience ever"
Not Verified |  Worst experience ever. Etihad is worse than Air Arabia Flight Air conditioning was off till we were in air about 1 and half hour. We had to take bus to reach the aircraft, and due to that we were made to board early. It was really suffocating. Seats were highly uncomfortable, no leg space, no proper backrest. Would definitely not suggest or prefer to travel with Etihad again

### "Will never fly Etihad again"
Not Verified |  Will never fly with Etihad again. It is a budget experience with a price tag. You have to pay for your seats, will get randomly allocated on check in if you don’t. The staff seemed meek and inexperienced on board. There was one toilet out of order which meant two different parts of the plane on the same side had to use one toilet. Lines of 7-10 at one point and the cleanliness was horrific. Abu Dhabi airport is also a terrible stop over. Gates don’t get announced until close to your time and not much sitting room. Will never fly Etihad again.

### "they do not care about customers"
We booked a holiday through a tour-operator who chose Etihad. I hadn't flown with this airline before so didn't know what to expect. Our crew (my wife, 2 teenagers and myself) opted to pay some 510 euro so we could sit together. Since the aircraft configuration is 3-3-3, we decided the 3 of my family would sit behind me and since I am 193 cm tall, I chose extra legroom seat. 1 day before departure (19 July 2023), we realised the seating was changed and no prior notice received. I spent 1 hour in the online chat and the agent managed to fix their blunder but only after I paid again (I was told: trust me, I would help you if I could). I purchased it and said to myself I'll sort it later. On our return, the same was noticed when checking in online. Close to 2 hours of our holiday spent chatting to someone who assured me he finally fixed the issue and asked me to save transcript of chat as evidence. Flight from Koh Samui to BKK with Bangkok airlines who couldn't issue boarding passes for the entire trip so in BKK had to go to transfer desk to get these issued and the agent there told us that the issue was not resolved and he 'fixed' it then and there. Flight from Bangkok to Abu Dhabi was OK. In Abu Dhabi when getting ready to board, a rude ground staff agent tore my boarding pass and issued me a new one which wasn't extra leg room which was paid for. When I asked, she simply said: 'all seats on the aircraft are fee-paying'. Absolutely shocking. Back for 2 weeks and emailed them using the appropriate form to try get an apology and a refund (out of principle). This is their response: "Thank you for your email. We are sorry we were unable to contact you by telephone to discuss your case. We have reviewed your booking and conclude that your reservation of seats does not qualify for a refund. There may be last-minute operational changes that mean we need to allocate you a different seat. If this happens, we will always try to choose a similar seat for you". The aircraft was 787 so no real issues with it. Felt old, seats hard and uncomfortable butt hat is subjective. Flight attendants were OK and the plane was clean. Purchased wifi on the flight from Dublin to Abu Dhabi and then to BKK but it was extremely patchy and unreliable. Attitude of support team even the social media team was appalling. I will never ever fly Etihad. Why bother when they do not care about customers. At the end of the day, Qatar and Emirates are better rated and appear to care about the passengers and their experience

### "food is 2/5 and needs attention"
Unable to print first leg Boarding Pass i have to go to desk. Boarding in MXP was fast and smooth. Have some dirt in table from previous passenger. Cabin crew were outstanding. Second leg boarding via bus. I have to mention something related to catering, the food is 2/5 and needs attention.

### "staff are relentless and extremely rude"
This review is about the ground staff at JFK airport who are relentless and extremely rude. I had a personal injury and arrived 1 hour prior to departure time instead of 3 hours and they wouldn’t even listen to me although I kept saying I’m pregnant and to add to that I had a personal injury when getting into the car en route to the airport. He wouldn’t even hear out and kept saying check in closed. Other airlines wait for the passengers even after boarding is completed. This is ridiculous behavior and it’s sad that they call themselves a family airline when they hire supervisors who are nasty.

### "informed that the upgrade was possible"
During my recent journey from London Heathrow to Manila with a layover at Abu Dhabi, I experienced several issues that significantly impacted my travel experience. The primary concern arose at the boarding gate of my connecting flight from AUH to MNL. Upon my initial inquiry at LHR, I was informed that a paid upgrade at the boarding gate is possible. With this understanding, my sister and I, both flying due to a family bereavement, were looking forward to a comfortable experience in business class. However, when I approached the ground staff at the AUH boarding gate, I was informed that the upgrade was possible however, I need to have it processed at the transfer desk, despite my understanding that it could be arranged and paid at the boarding gate. The transfer desk staff at AUH had previously affirmed the possibility of an upgrade at the boarding gate, I noted a discrepancy in the level of service provided by the cabin crew during my flight from LHR to AUH. My journey  could have been notably positive with a minor additional assistance, and I believe such small gestures can greatly impact passenger perception.

### "Would avoid if possible"
Not Verified |  Would avoid if possible. Although not a horrible aircraft the ground crew and brand made the experience deplorable, the airline assigned seats randomly in the aircraft for our honey moon, one leg of our flight was overbooked, and some passengers had to stay. Airport at Abu Dhabi is not a place for a long connection, bathrooms were not sanitary. When demanding our claim airport staff refused to attend our plea and asked us to go through the website. Overall feels like a company that once wanted to compete with Emirates, but stopped trying and just gets leftover traffic in the middle east.

### "our expectations for Etihad weren't met"
Unfortunately, our expectations for Etihad weren't met. The stewards and stewardesses were kind, this is the good point I can give. The food was okay too, but the seat leg room was inferior to other companies we took in Economy class for Japan (ANA, Swiss, etc.) I have leg problems and it was really painful. The seat material was scratchy. The worst, we had to pay for choosing our seats during online check-in so we could be together (we were separated during the first flight.) We had 4 flights in total and in 2 of them, the entertainment screen was dirty and they didn't have eye-masks and ear plus available for everyone depending where you were sitting. The layover in Abu-Dhabi was awful. I thought it would be pleasant, since this is a wealthy country, but nothing: long bus travel to the terminal, just a cramped small corridor, uncomfortable chair, very expensive options if you need to rest. It just felt messy. I am sorry as I don't like to badmouth companies usually, but I feel like I had to, as both my husband, my mother and I were expecting so much more from Etihad (which is sometimes compared to the WAY better Emirates.) Again, the positive point was the staff on board, and the flights were on time. The entertainment had enough choices, though less than in other airlines I took. I paid for the WiFi during one of the trips, and to be honest it was useless, it didn't work most of the time.

### "a horrible experience"
Not Verified | I do not recommend. My first flight from Germany to the UAE was delayed by 6 hours, and because of that I missed the connection flight to Australia. When we landed in the UAE they did not give us the next available flight, but booked me a poor hotel and promised a flight the next day. Then the next day I came to the airport after the bus was delayed by 3 hours, boarded the plane, we went up the runway and they took us back because Sydney Airport had a curfew for planes and we would of not made it on time. I had to sleep a night on the airport floor, and then at 5:00 the next day they finally took off (after some AC failure). Although the crew were very nice it was a horrible experience and I am never flying EtiBAD again

### "decent travel experience mostly"
Punctual and decent travel experience mostly. Booked wheelchair, provided from Cochin to Abu Dhabi, from Abu Dhabi refused but from Heathrow given a wheelchair facility. There was water scarcity from the beginning of Abu Dhabi to Heathrow, even a 60+ old year lady asked multiple times not given.

### "many had broken entertainment systems"
The flights departed and arrived on time, the connecting flights were good and the staff were helpful and friendly but everything else was pretty bad. We had a very old Boeing 777 plane for a 14 hour flight and many people had broken entertainment systems. The food was barely edible, disgusting in fact. Won’t be paying $3,600 again for such bad service. Prefer Emirates, Singapore Airlines or Qantas.

### "Etihad made this a really bad experience"
I flew from Munich to Kochi via Abu Dhabi with an infant and my 5 year old child. We had booked the bassinet seats more than a month prior to the travel and they were confirmed. During online check-in we found that for the second leg, the seats were changed. Initially booked seats were 6A and 6B. However, they moved my seat to 6E and my daughter's seat a couple of rows behind and it was not possible to book the seats together online. The flight was the same type. I contacted support and they said it could be a technical fault or something and we can change it at the airport. At Munich airport, they agreed that the change of seats were unacceptable (from the automatic assignment) and that they cannot make a child sit in another row from the parent. However, they said they cannot change the seat from Munich but the boarding staff "should" change it at Abu Dhabi airport. At Abu Dhabi, they said the flight is full and we should have got this changed earlier. The cabin crew asked to initially sit in the assigned seat and that they can get us seated together when boarding is complete. I did not want to leave my crying daughter in another row and luckily the person in seat 6F said that he can move to my daughter's seat. The seats 6A-6D were given to a family with older children. Flying with children is not easy and Etihad made this a really bad experience. We booked Etihad owing to the good schedule even though the price was quite high owing to the holiday period. We sent a complaint 3 weeks ago and we have still not received any replies.

### "the flight was pleasant"
Not Verified | The flight was awesome and amazing. Crew should improve their behavior little bit. We loved the flight meal was also average. TV was also big enough and the flight was pleasant.

### "fed up with Etihad"
Not Verified | Hands down the worst airline service I have ever recieved. I am a Platinum member with Etihad Airways and have been flying with them for years especially to the US. In recent years, the entire aspect of Etihad as become horrible. Customer service is non-existent and when you do get in contact, they are rude and uninterested in your concerns. I have been trying to book a flight using my Air miles (600,000 miles) to several destinations for 8 MONTHS and Etihad claims that they don't have a single available seat on ANY aircraft on ANY date to multiple destinations over the span of 8 months. Customer service keeps arguing that they can't do anything and no proper manager will ever get to the phone to explain this. Furthermore, staff and service in general has become a joke. There is no Customer loyalty, no genuine interest to help customers (especially someone who has been flying with Etihad frequently for 10+ years). I am completely displeased and fed up with Etihad. I will indefinitely be switching to Emirates where customers are appreciated and service is actually something that is cared about.

### "first leg of journey is missing"
Early June while randomly checking for my tkt on Etihad website noticed that first leg of journey is missing from my itinerary. I was surprised and thought it would be system error. So I checked again after 2 days and the issue was same. I was concerned, so called cleartrip (from where I booked my tkt) to check what was wrong and they said first leg journey was cancelled by Etihad, saying flight was cancelled. Firstly, I was never informed either via sms or email about this cancellation. Had I not checked it out of coincidence, I would never have known about this cancellation until my journey day. Secondly, airline did not bother to offer alternate option to me. The airline website showed same flight (which was apparently cancelled) taking new bookings. I opted for cancellation of ticket and refund on 5-6-23, however, till today 11-7-23 I am yet to receive any refund. Cleartrip says they are following the airline but still no news at all.

### "representative sarcastic and cannot help"
Cancelled the ticket 45 days ago. I have been talking to customer service since my cancellation date they confirmed it from the very first day. Now when I call they tell me that they had a technical glitch and I have to wait another 45 days for it to be processed. They will not send any confirmation email. The representative was sarcastic and said he cannot help. When I explained to them and asked why the other 10 representatives before them spoke differently and promised it would be refunded. Very shady. Never ever book with Etihad airways. We booked a choice plus flight ticket as our trip plan was volatile. Even after paying extra money for a flexible ticket the worst experience. Please do not book with them if you want to make changes for your ticket. Very shady airline - I cannot stress enough. I have recorded voice calls and saved chat conversations which I can submit to prove my point. You can check the confirmation they sent in the endorsement part of the ticket.

### "Overall it was a pretty hard trip"
I bought tickets with seats for me and my infant child, but at the check-in counter, they said that in their system they only have a seat for me but not for my child, though I separately paid for a child seat! They did not want to solve the issue in any way, and even on aircraft, they did not allow me and my child to seat on a fully free row of unoccupied seats. Overall it was a pretty hard trip due to that.

### "Etihad showed complete disregard"
Etihad managed to cancel my initial flight for unclear reasons. I was offered a refund or an alternate flight through my travel agent. Etihad showed complete disregard to the fact that due to their cancellation, I’ve had to incur changes in changing my hotel bookings and essentially extending my trip. My layover at AUH is now 5 hours 30 mins instead of 1 hour and 50 mins. I am travelling with a small child. All I had requested from Etihad for giving me all this trouble was to give my family access to the lounge at the airport as they have been directly responsible for the increase in our lay over time. I had not even asked for compensation for the charges I’ve had to incur to modify our holiday. Etihad showed complete disregard to this and demonstrated a clear lack of professionalism towards us in this case. Quite shocking, they are not the same airline as they used to be in the past and after the above incident, I will not be to travelling with them again and would not recommend anyone to either.

### "I have learnt my lesson"
BCN-AUH-LHE. Had a flight on 24th May 10.15am departure. After the boarding at BCN they kept us waiting at the boarding gate until 6pm, before announcing that the flight was cancelled due to a technical fault. During that 10 hours ordeal, no one had any decency to inform the passengers of what was going on, they kept changing the departure time with the increments of 1 hours. 1 snack voucher was provided which had a value of 5€, no lunch or drinks were provided. Finally at 6pm they told everyone to collect our baggage and wait at check-in area to be given hotel spaces. The off-loaded baggage arrived after 2 hours which to me was deliberate as they wanted to minimise the time passengers would spend at the hotel. Finally after another 2 hours wait in the queue, they told everyone to wait for buses to be taken to the hotel. The hotel was 1 and a half hour drive outside of Barcelona where we finally reached at 11.30pm. There was no communication as to when we will be picked up for our next day flight etc. At 4am, we were told bus had arrived for us, so hurried to the airport where they checked everyone in for 10.15am departure. At 11am, they told us that the aircraft that had just arrived from AUH to pick us up, was faulty as well. We were all then loaded onto the busses and taken to another aircraft which was parked at a half hour drive on the other side of the airport and finally that departed with the delay of over 2 hours. Abu Dhabi airport is another disgrace, you could smell the toilets from miles away, crowded space with low ceiling and rude staff. The flight to LHE was on a Airbus A320 with no IFE and in the name of in flight meal, they presented us with a bland sandwich. I asked for a diabetic meal in advance but due to cancelled flight and their crap service, never got it. All in all, I will never fly this joke of an airline again and recommend everyone to avoid them. They are not professional, will not communicate with customers if something went wrong and just treat their customers in a worst possible way. Choose Emirates or Qatar like I always do and couldn't do it this time because of last minute travel requirement. I have learnt my lesson and will never waste a penny on these clowns.

### "5 star in every way!"
5 star in every way! It was my first trip on Etihad and I was surprised by the high standard of both a professional but also authentic service on board. Food and beverage were exceptional and the fact that you can choose when you would like to eat is a bonus. Both aircrafts, the 787 and 350 were very comfortable. Entertainment program is good and easy to navigate. A great experience!

### "don't trust them anymore"
Not Verified | It was a terrifying experience from Etihad. I have booked my ticket on Etihad from Manchester to Kochi, via Abu Dhabi, on April 2013. The ticket was confirmed and when I reached the airport the airline people give me only one boarding pass, and said that the next one will be issued at Abu Dhabi. I didn't feel anything unusual about that. When I reached Abu Dhabi the transfer desk crew told me that I cant travel on the flight which I have booked and the flight is over booked. I was shocked and I found a group of people who were in my situation, fighting with the staff as they were nearly 24 hours in Abu Dhabi for the next flight. The reason was economy travelers have seats only after other class, and this was not mentioned during the ticket was booked. After a long fight I got my seat, after all the passengers boarded. This was the first time I travel on Etihad and will be the last time. I don't trust them anymore.

### "food trays etc, in the emergency exit"
Not Verified |  Had an aisle seat by emergency exit, after meal was served passengers piled up the rubbish ie food trays etc, in the emergency exit. It sat there for hours, along with a large passenger bag. The flight attendant who walked past many many times, just ignored it. I had to complain before reluctantly anything was done. Obviously passenger safety does not include economy class.

### "unpleasant experiences"
First time flying with Etihad and was looking forward to it, check-in staff ex BKK was great and helpful but things started to go downhill onboard. The crew on left aisle were friendly and nice but not on my aisle, during meal service i was expecting a hello and meal choice offer but instead the ‘unknown’ meal was rudely dumped on my tray table without saying a word. Then I asked for a glass of red wine with my meal but she bluntly told me ‘Not Now!’ and said only coffee, tea or juices. The crew on the other aisle served me and my partner red wines without hesitation. She did not return nor check on me throughout the flight. She never smiled and never used service language throughout flight which was a shock to my surprise how she got this job. Then during transit in AUH, the ground staff at transit desk was rude and indifferent. From AUH to LHR, we asked for a glass of red wine during meal service again we were not served and did not get back to us at all. Some crew are nice but some crew are not and can be down right rude. The economy seat was actually quite spacious and comfortable. IFE was quite good. Unfortunately due to the unpleasant experiences from certain crew or staff which ruined our trip, I don’t think I’ll be flying with them anytime sooner.

### "would gladly fly them anytime"
I have no doubt that plenty of people have had bad experiences, but I want to share a generally positive one. I've flown ~20,000 miles on Etihad now and they've always treated me well. Every single flight has left on time, no delays. The staff is nice, the food is good enough, the movie selection is good, the baggage allowance is extremely generous, the ticket prices are usually below average, etc. I'm a big fan of Etihad and would gladly fly them anytime. Also, one other detail. This is probably dependent on many factors, but I notice that at airport check-in the lines for Etihad are usually *significantly* shorter than the check in line for Emirates. Just a nice little bonus.

### "they don't seem to really care"
Let me share with you the awful experience I had (and still have with Etihad).It started some days before my flight (which was from the 30th of April to 1st of May, from Barcelona to Seoul, with a layoff in Abu Dhabi). Etihad has this offer where you can bid to reserve the seats on your row to have no neighbors during the flight. For my flight from Abu Dhabi to Seoul, I thought it was a good idea to reserve a seat and bid for the two seats next to me to have no neighbors, be more comfortable and get some sleep during the flight. So I bid and got the 2 extra seats reserved for me. They sent me this nice email with this great phrase "You will enjoy a neighbor-free seat onboard. I was very much looking forward to it. My friends, on the same flights, also did it (they were the ones that suggested me) and also got the bid won. Yet, I thought I should not get too happy, maybe they will mess up something...and that's what exactly happened. Two large men came and say: those are our seats and I was no, I reserved them. They politely acknowledge it, although Etihad really assigned them those seats. It was even more confusing because they put to those seats a little paper on the benches' head support saying they were reserved. They tried to sit one man on another reserved seat behind me but the couple that reserved it protested. In the end, the attendant came to me, apologize, and said that they probably had last minute reservation, and the plane was fully booked (not true as my friends and other passengers enjoyed their neighbor's free seat). The attendant told me that he will contact the airline to report the issue ASAP. Later I gave him my contact info on paper with all the details. But nobody contacted me. So I emailed them on the 1st of May, to which they answered: We're currently receiving a high number of emails. Thank you for your patience whilst we work through each case as quickly as possible. If your case requires a response, a member of our team will get back to you within a maximum of 14 days. I still haven't received any news 28 days later. I contacted their support services multiple times on Twitter and every time, they asked me to leave the time to the team to do their investigation. I asked them how long it will take and they stayed vague...In the first email, I also asked them to cancel the reservation I made for the seat I reserved for my flight back because I didn't want to give Etihad more money until my case was solved, but no one answered. Etihad didn't deliver a service I paid for and I strongly recommend to anyone to not bid for blocking a neighbor's seat as they can take it away from you if someone else books a ticket at the last minute, worst, they can take it away from you and make you wait, and not refund you (so far that's what happened to me). I fear I will soon have no choice but to contact a lawyer to get this problem solved. They should have automatically acknowledged it and refunded me once those seats were taken back from me and given to other passengers. Yet, they leave me with the impression they don't seem to really care. I had issues in the past with other airlines and have always been answered in respectable delays, even during the first month of the covid pandemic that forced many airlines to cancel flights. Etihad has so far not shown me any sign of willingness to refund me.

### "will never fly with them again"
Not Verified |  They weighed my backpack which never happens usually and they made me pay for the extras and that’s more than the ticket itself! I had to empty everything and put in the big luggage, and when I came back they didn’t even measure the backpack and they charged me for the extra kilos in the big luggage! So cheap will never fly with them again.

### "never refunded my cancelled flight"
Not Verified |  They never refunded my cancelled flight despite confirming that it would be done in 45 days. They never send you any email to confirm the cancellation they just confirm it by chat (that they don’t also forward to a email once done) then they claim it was a no show and they can’t trace back the he cancellation. Either they lie to keep the money or their system is so poor or inexistant which is quiet worrying for an airline. Lower customer service than a cheap budget airline. Would never use them again.

### "still not received a refund"
After cancelling one of my connecting flights on my return journey, Etihad refused to rebook me on another flight. They said the only option was a refund, which I begrudgingly accepted because there was no other option. I had to spend money out of my own pocket to rebook with another airline at a much higher price because it was short notice. I have waited nearly 3 months and I have still not received a refund. Every time I contact the team either on web chat or phone they just keep stalling, they keep telling me they have to email the refunds team which will take another 5 working days, and there is no chance for me to contact them directly. This is beginning to seem like the behaviour of scam artists.

### "most disappointing airline"
The most disappointing airline I have ever flown with. The only reason I booked with the them was the price and promise of a free hotel when doing a stopover in Abu Dhabi. There is no free a hotel it is a SCAM. First they said it is because of the F1 black out dates, even if travelling one week before that. The availability for my dates, although you cannot check the availability until you book your flight. Then you are stuck with a multi-city itinerary that does not allow any changes or cancellations. Customer service won't answer or take any responsibility. Flights were ok I guess, food was mediocre and IFE did not work properly on one of the flights. I will avoid this airline in the future and never recommend it.

### "staff rude and unprofessional"
Not Verified | Cabin staff service was totally rude and unprofessional. Especially when they serve passengers who cannot speak English. All cabin staff was always angry to someone who did not understand English. I definitely rate this airline is 1 star. Never fly with airline anymore.

### "Complete disappointment"
Complete disappointment. Very poor web system, no possibility to do check-in online, always got error, call center agent advised that it was a system error. For both sectors surprisingly. Traveling with no luggage and infant, with departure 3 am, expected to do check-in online, save time and have smooth peaceful time, unfortunately needed to arrive earlier, go to counter and all the mess at gate after. Was no organized area next to gate, it was impossible to reach gate trough narrow rows between seats, already filled with others and their luggage, how could we expect to have priority for boarding if we could not even reach the gate. The worst part. Baby stroller arrived at Rome airport and we needed to look for it, no assistance from any Etihad staff. Stroller was damaged, full of scratches and soft part was cut. This was my first experience flying with Etihad and it was a complete shock. Out trip just for a weekend turned into so many issues : no check-in online, damaged stroller upon arrival to Rome, 1 hour waiting for stroller at Abu Dhabi airport. No possibility to travel easy and be treated really well. staff at AUH airport was not helpful at all, bounced us counter-lift-counter-lift, wait for your stroller there, wait here. Etihad is not family and customer oriented in general.

### "would highly recommend"
Etihad is a really good airline. Check-in was smooth, so was the luggage processing. Their officer (JED airport) was pretty flexible with we taking a bit extra weight on the cabin. The cabin crew was pretty helpful as a number of airhostesses tended to my baby when he was crying. Food was also good, and so are the 32' pitch seats. I would highly recommend it.

### "One of the worst airlines I have flown"
One of the worst airlines I have flown. The flight was over 13 hours. The seats were really uncomfortable which I noticed within 30 secs and continued to be uncomfortable throughout the flight. The support (bottom) part barely covered from buttocks to half the thigh. I am 5ft 3".The seat cushions hard and the fabric rough. Almost no space between seats so you can not reach the things you may have in your bag below. And if the person in front chooses to lay back, which she did for almost the entire 13 hour flight, then you can almost no space to move. Luckily I had an aisle seat. You can barely move to the aisle from the window seat. The food trays were flimsy and low. The seat pockets hold next to nothing. Very little food was served. And 2 hot meals for the entire flight beginning and end. And the gave a paper bag in the middle of flight with sandwich. The worst flying experience ever. This kind of airplane and flights should be prohibited by law. There should be a minimum of comfort required.

### "dirty cabin with incompetent crew"
I was looking forward to the premium experience of Etihad. That immediately ended as soon as I boarded the B787 in Zurich. Old, worn, dirty cabin with incompetent crew. Only got worse when boarding the B777 in Abu Dhabi for 13hrs to Melbourne with wife & myself literally on top of each other middle seats. It was too close even for married couples but would be a nightmare and not possible for strangers. Cannot believe Etihad can have this cabin on popular long haul legs. Only saving grace was excellent FA on my side of the aisle who was apologetic and somewhat embarrassed about the cabin, but did a great job on service.

### "Etihad can’t match the other carrier’s overall services"
Booked a return flight to Thailand with Etihad. The first leg to Abu Dhabi was with an A350, brand new plane. I must admit that Etihad livery is the best one I’ve seen. Along with on time-ish departure, unfortunately they are the only positive things I can think of. Although the plane was new, the seats are cramped, a thing that I noticed to many other airlines with new planes, and I am definitely not a tall person. They’re just pouring as many seats as possible which is very inconvenient for longer flights. Surprisingly, on the 777 plane from AUH to BKK, although was an older plane, the seats were much more comfortable, thus confirming what I mentioned above. The food onboard was just average, it lacks presentation and quality like you get on Qatar, Emirates or Turkish. IFE was just ok, not too many options to choose from. The crew was not as proactive as the other middle eastern carriers mentioned above. Together with AUH airport experience (an old and tired airport) I must admit that my first experience was not so great with Etihad and I really wanted to love them as they look so stylish (apparently only from outside). I usually fly to Asia only with Qatar and unfortunately Etihad can’t match the other carrier’s overall services, and they are on the same price range.

### "Service poor"
We were very disappointed by the following: Seats very cramped, when queuing for the toilet you felt you were imposing on peoples personal space. Service poor - we waited for over two hours for some water, our wine with dinner on all flights never appeared. On each journey we only had one drink! bearing in mind our flights were all over 11hrs. The in-flight entertainment system didn't work on our last flight, the only things available was BBC world news and a few games. The food selection was poor and often ran out. On one flight both meals had bland, dry pasta for the vegetarian option. (the vegetarian curry option on another flight was actually very tasty). We will not be booking with airline again and have advised friends and family to avoid.

### "avoid if you can"
Worst Airline, avoid if you can. My return trip was scheduled on 24/09/2022. I went to Ottawa airport at 4pm to check-in for my connection trip to Toronto via Air Canada. On the check-in counter, I spent over 45 minutes as the agent was not able to find the boarding passes for the Etihad Flight from Toronto to Abu Dhabi. When I tried to clarify the reason of not being able to get the boarding passes of the second flight, the agent answered that I have consumed too much of her time and Air Canada does not have contract with Etihad Airways and I need to contact Etihad Airways as this is not their problem and Air Canada is not responsible for the remainder of the flight. I have spoken to Air Canada Duty Supervisor as well who was not able to find any solution for me. In fact, the duty supervisor answered me in a very rough way when she came to know I am flying on Etihad that they have no connections with Etihad and will not provide any assistance or feedback on my inquiry. On the boarding gate of Air Canada flight to Toronto we came to know by 5:45pm that there is a delay for 6pm flight to Toronto by 2 hours due to technical problem in the aircraft. The flight was rescheduled for departure by 8:10pm and arrival to Toronto by 9:10 pm while Etihad flight departure to Abu Dhabi is scheduled 9:40pm. My husband contacted Etihad customer service in Abu Dhabi for a solution. He contacted Etihad Customer Service at 2:28AM Abu Dhabi Time. During the conversation he was directed to supervisor. The supervisor confirmed that I will not be able to catch Etihad Flight and recommended rebooking on the following day 25/09/2022 same itinerary (Ottawa – Toronto on Air Canada departure 6pm arrival 7pm and Toronto – Abu Dhabi on Etihad departure 9:40pm). Hence, I asked Air Canada to cancel my check-in to allow Etihad for rebooking. I had to collect my 8 pieces checked-in luggage (which included 2 car seats) + 2 handbags and stroller and booked a taxi back home. The Supervisor informed my husband during the call that there is a Transfer desk in Toronto Airport where I will find upon my landing to print for me Etihad boarding passes. Unfortunately, this information is not correct. On the second day, I booked a taxi again and reached Ottawa Airport at 4pm and checked in on Air Canada Counter. They were also not able to issue my boarding pass for Etihad flight due to absence of contract with Etihad. On the boarding gate, I was again informed that Air Canada flight got delayed and will depart 7:40pm instead of 6pm. The reason provided by Air Canada is “No Aircraft”. Air Canada took off 7:59pm and reached Toronto Airport around 8:50pm. However, I had to stay in the aircraft for around 25 minutes as there is no facility in Toronto Airport to receive the aircraft for the gate.

### "extremely disappointing"
Having never flown on this type of aircraft before I was appalled at my journey yesterday. The seats are super tiny, think child size but squeeze an adult into them. I’m not a large person at all, 5ft 4 female but was squashed in between two large guys, one who insisted on typing on his laptop most of the journey and continually invading my space with his arms/elbows. Refreshments are not very forthcoming and I had to keep asking for water, which when it arrived was half a paper cup. Food was disappointing. The only saving grace is that i didn’t get my upgrade to business offer accepted and waste more money as these seats also looked well past their sell by date. Overall, extremely disappointing and won’t be in a rush to fly Etihad again.

### "Overall a horrible experience"
Overall a horrible experience. Delayed departure from Frankfurt of more than 1h. Upon arrival in Abu Dhabi, the Gangway did not work, so we were made to wait another 35min before disembarkation. Needless to say the connecting flight to Riyadh was missed but the worst part of it was that the ground staff were completely clueless and hardly helpful. No service quality at all. I have Platinum status of Etihad as a frequent flier, but after that experience and the ridiculously high prices for average to below-average service quality. It looks like the Etihad management is detached from the reality of service the airline is providing in general. A complaint filed with the Etihad Guest Platinum Service, was replied to after 22 days. For me this was my last trip with Etihad.

### "Very bad service"
Very bad service, not very Clear where to go for Help. Help desk even in security zone to pass by. Overbooking is on regular basis unfortunately. In cabin the service is ok. But airline itself is disaster. No Hotel inside airport so you have to go outside if you miss your flight because of overbooking by Airline and pay meals, taxi yourself.

### "They just don’t seem to care"
Travellers beware when you book flights with Etihad Airlines because they don’t always give you what you paid for. I recently travelled on Etihad Airlines economy space class ticket round trip from Toronto to Calicut, India via Abu Dhabi. The regular economy class ticket is Can$1771 but an upgrade to economy space is Can$2000 more but provides better seats with more legroom for long flights. My economy space ticket cost Can$3100 but on my return flight I was given a regular economy boarding pass and told I would be given an economy space seat only to be told on board the flight that there were no more economy space seats. Once we landed in Canada my legs were so swollen I could barely walk. I’ve called Etihad customer service and was told a manager would call me to sort out the problem. I’ve called every day for 5 days because no manager has called me to remedy or compensate anything whatsoever. They just don’t seem to care. So travellers beware when you fly Etihad Airlines because you don’t always get what you paid for.

### "Large legroom for economy"
Large legroom for economy seats, attentive cabin crew. Clean cabin and toilets and a very helpful call center. The food and in flight entertainment are not bad but can be improved more.

### "an unwelcoming attitude"
Abu Dhabi to Riyadh was booked on March 5 at 9:55pm, instead i changed it to 02:45pm at 11:00AM. I book an extra 15kg weight but it did not go through when the booking was changed. On the booking management website it did not show extras. Out of fear I will arrive to the airport without the 15kg I paid for, it a second time and thought i will request a refund later. When I called the call center, I was met with a concerning attitude from the agent. From the first minute, she had an unwelcoming attitude, followed by a series of unemphatic approach such as us it is your mistake, you should read the terms and conditions, contact the feedback team. Then she said you have a screen shot of the booking management page not showing the error?

### "the service was a disaster"
Abu Dhabi to Amsterdam, the boarding process was chaotic, since seats at others were not assigned contiguously or as desired. I was ready to change my seat so that a family with 2 small children would have the space to sleep in row 15. I would like to complain about the staff employed for the 17H ​​area. The board service was unfriendly from the start. No rubbish was cleared away, the service was a disaster. Other guests also noticed this. The staff even commented when serving the drink that this was the last drink, she couldn't keep pouring anything.

### "a very disappointing experience"
Just had a very disappointing experience flying Etihad’s new business class on their A350. First the good: the plane’s interior design is very attractive. Now the bad: 1) Etihad uses Air India’s lounge at JFK. Seriously? This was one of the dirtiest and least attractive airline lounges I’ve ever been in. We left within minutes of arriving. 2) Many of Etihad’s online systems both app and online - just don’t function correctly. It was not possible to manage any part of my booking online or via the app. Not possible to choose seats or check-in. 3) While the plane is beautiful, scratch and you’ll discover that beauty is only skin deep. Many of the new plane’s innovations do no function properly. Outlets don’t work, the silly built-in phone charger didn’t work, the entertainment controller was extremely unresponsive and didn't work effectively. Seat was not comfortable compared to other business class seats. 4) The bathrooms were not clean and did not function well. 5) Worst of all on this flight was the service. While the flight attendants were nice enough, they didn’t provide some of the basic service I'd expect even if flying economy. Glasses and water bottles were never collected, my empty coffee mug sat on my tray for almost an hour and no one ever thought to ask if I wanted a refill. 6) The cabin was kept ridiculously warm making it impossible to sleep. 12 hour flight without a minute of sleep. In the future, I will stick with Emirates, Singapore and Qatar when expecting a premium airline experience.

### "I will never fly Etihad in future"
Awful airline. They did not transfer my miles to American and for several months never bothered to respond to my calls and emails. Then they rudely sent an email saying they needed proof from me that I did not get miles from American. This is preposterous. First of all it is their job to transfer miles. Secondly they should respond on time. Finally how can I prove a negative. Then they said that it has been a long time and so they are unsure how they can help and I should work with American. I have all the emails. I will never fly Etihad in future.

### "very uncomfortable"
Travelled 30 years of my life. Can rate Etihad as the worst airline ever. I paid a very high ticket price for just 1 way from Mumbai to Toronto. Cabin crew forever sleeping behind closed curtains. They do not have food to offer for the long flight of 15 hours in business class. Being a diabetic was very uncomfortable. Not even a bottle of water was offered until asked. Uncooperative staff, guys please do not travel Etihad.

### "my bag did not make it"
The airline changed my flight schedule on the way to Abu Dhabi, without notification. This way I didn't know that my time to change flights in Munich was shortened by 20 minutes, which meant that the new boarding time in Munich was before my arrival time from my first leg. Had I known, I would not have checked in my bag. Of course my bag did not make it, so I had to survive 2 full working days in business meetings in Abu Dhabi with the same clothes I wore since the moment I left my house (the shops did not open before I started to work and we had a social event that I had to attend, so no way to go out and buy fresh clothes). The airline was not able to provide my bag before I left the hotel again on the second day, because they don’t deliver after 19:00 in the evening and were not quick enough to bring it before I had to check out on the second day, even though I wrote my exact times on the baggage claim. I came back to the airport and had to chase my bag, going in and out the security zone with their personnel. Once I got my bag I had to check it in again, because Etihad had zero understanding for me asking for access to a shower. They told me that I can pay myself to get access to a hotel, where I can shower and change and to then make a claim or I could use the public toilets for changing or the public shower behind security. I tried the online-claim on the first day and did not make it past the ticket number, because I booked via Lufthansa and Etihad didn't accept their ticket number. Etihad even weighed my backpack and since my medicine, laptop, mobile phone, jumper, passport, wallet and jumper already had 8 kg, I could not take any clothes to change with me to the shower. I will never ever use this airline again.

### "worst flying experience"
Not Verified |  Had the worst flying experience of my life. They cancelled my connecting flight from Abu dhabi to Hyderabad and I had to wait for an extra 10 hours for the nest flight. They compensated for the cancellation with a burger meal, a burger meal for 10 hours! They did not consider that I had an infant with me and they did not have infant food at the airport. Airport staff was rude as was the flight staff. The aircraft was comparable to a budget airline. Very uncomfortable seats.

### "cabin was neat and clean, the seats comfortable"
As an airline enthusiast, I chose Etihad in order to experience a new gulf state carrier. I had high expectations, having immensely enjoyed earlier flights with Emirates and Qatar. While not a flawless experience, my flights with Etihad confirmed their reputation. The check-in experience in Bangkok was a little contentious, as the agent insisted that my tennis racket needed to travel as checked luggage. This was a new experience after fifty years of air travel. The Miracle lounges that Etihad uses at BKK are satisfactory but unexceptional. I would say the same for the Etihad lounge in Abu Dhabi. The cabin was neat and clean, the seats comfortable, and the amenity kit full of useful and aromatic products. Pre-departure champagne (or a Bellini ) was served in a flute, and the cabin crew out of Bangkok were warm and welcoming. The crew from Abu Dhabi to Milan were somewhat more subdued, but given the 02:45 departure time, so was I. I want to particularly commend the purser on my flight EY 407 from BKK. She was helpful, kind, and engaging and her efforts moved this experience into one of my most positively memorable flights. The mechanics of the flights - departure, arrival, luggage delivery, etc. were all on punctual.

### "somewhat pleasant 14 hour"
Overall as expected from a 4 star full-service carrier. The luggage allowance of 30kg for discount economy flyers proved more generous than expected as my two pieces of baggage totalled up to about 32kgs, yet the gate agent still didn't raise any issues or charge me any additional luggage fees. As expected the 777s within Etihad's fleet are somewhat dated interior wise, where since the particular aircraft (first flight in 2012 after looking up its registration) took its maiden flight it is most likely the interior has not been renovated since. This doesn't prevent the crew from still delivering on a somewhat pleasant 14 hour flight tho, with 2 full meals and snacks in between. The only downside is the lack of a self-service snack bar in the galley of the aircraft, which made finding a quick bite, or even trying to grab some water after sleeping particularly difficult. With all that in mind and considering the relatively affordable price point, makes the flight still one worth recommending.

### "Bitterly disappointing"
Not Verified |  I flew from Dublin to Sydney recently and the second leg of my trip was terrible. The plane for this leg for archaic with narrow seats, horrible leg space, and a tiny entertainment screen. The TV froze 1 minute into my 14 hour flight. I said this to the cabin crew straight away but was ignored until I asked for a 5th time almost 3 hours into the flight. In the end, they couldn't fix it, they claimed they couldn't move me as the plane was full, and offer me a $15 wifi voucher as compensation. Firstly, the wifi voucher only last 6 hours maximum, but in reality it doesn't even last that long. The staff member informed me that the data limit was low and so I couldn't watch videos on it, and this wasn't useful to me at all. The most disappointing part, however, is Etihad's indifference and poor service after the fact by refusing to do anything for me as "they already gave me a wifi voucher as a service recovery. Bitterly disappointing from start to finish. Do not fly with them.

### "The flight itself was alright"
The flight itself was alright, good food, nice cabin crew, no tv (no big deal) there was streaming of movies available through planes wireless network on your own device. However, when checking in I realised we have only one small 7kg bag each and not even personal item allowed. We had three large suitcases and guess how much Etihad wanted to charge us during online check in - 600 euros per bag. For me that was shocking. Would I recommend it? Overall yes, but if you need to pay that kind of money for luggage absolutely not! Disappointing.

### "Felt like a budget airline"
Seats were narrow but legroom was okay. Not comfortable seats at all. Food was horrible, in flight entertainment was very poor. Cabin crew were surly, they all looked really unhappy. This was a really poor experience, more expensive than rival airlines. I won't travel with them again after the return leg is used. Felt like a budget airline but with miserable crew.

### "worst experience is T3 Abu Dhabi"
It's cheaper than emirates, but by no means cheap. All the planes are quite dated. If I had paid for business, I'd want my money back. The food on our November flight here was the worst food I've ever had on an airline. Inedible. The trip from Istanbul, where the Turkish people have much pride, was excellent. From Syd to Abu Dhabi, and Abu Dhabi to Athens, foul. I have always found the cabin crew to be polite, so no dramas there. The worst experience is T3 Abu Dhabi. It has got to be the worst airport I've ever had the displeasure of using. T3 is dedicated to Etihad and the facilities are so substandard. One toilet block for multiple gates with few toilets. Also downstairs so a big hassle. Then the security - you pass through the usual security, buy some water on way to gate, and then it is confiscated at the actual hate. WTF!. Then you have to sit in gate and wait with no access to water. Why not put the vending machine inside the gate? And what's the point of security if the check is disregarded and you have to be checked all over again at the gate. Only airline and airport this has ever happened to me. This experience is likely a reason I will pay extra and fly Emirates next time.

### "should make an insurance claim"
A flight attendant was bringing a drink and snack down the aisle. A passenger in an opposite backwards seat to me got up, crashed into her by accident, causing the drink and food to go flying into my seat which I was asleep in. Luckily the liquid was not hot. It went over my phone, charger and book and my blanket. My phone came up with an error message saying liquid had got into it, the charger fizzled out and my book was ruined. One of the crew took my phone into the galley and dried it out. I agree it was an accident but the report was written on a napkin. I was advised someone from “customer care” would contact me. They didn’t. A few days later I went on “live chat” they said log a complaint. The complaint was supposedly investigated but the response I received was inaccurate in the extreme. When I tried to follow up, I was ignored. I logged a further complaint only to be tersely told that if anything was damaged I should make an insurance claim and that the case was closed. (This took 3.5 months. A dreadful service, a dreadful response and if that had been a hot meal or drink - a particularly dreadful outcome for the passenger.

### "on top of everything useless staff"
The whole experience was like flying with a low cost airline. Very little space, really low level of comfort. And on top of everything useless staff. The person in front of me reclined his seat and even in such a limited space that I had it wasn't a problem for me. But it was a long flight and the person in front of me didn't put his seat back during a meal service. I asked a cabin crew member to ask him to put his seat back just that i can eat for a few minutes. She asked him to slightly slightly put his seat up and he didn't really do anything. I showed her that i can't put anything on my tray in this position (i couldn't put my tray down because the seat was too low and it was impossible to put anything between that seat and my legs) so she just had some strange look on her face like sorry but I don't care and left. So for the whole trip i wasn't be able to eat. In normal airplanes it's a must to have all seats in upright position for takeoff, landing and meal service. When the next meal was served I showed her again that I'm not able to put anything on my tray and she offered me to change my paid window seat next to my husband and go on some middle seat on the back - because she couldn't ask a customer in front of me to put his seat back for only 10 minutes.

### "What a terrible experience"
What a terrible experience for a "world class airline". It started with the stupid decision of thinking the airline actually cares about you paying money to reserve your seats in advance - they don't. We paid to reserve window seats together only to get on the plane and realize our seats were reassigned and we were given middle centre seats. Luckily, we had a member of the cabin crew who helped us sit in the front row which brings me to the friendliness of their staff but that's pretty much the only good thing about this airline. On our way back from London, we decided to pay $220 to upgrade to Premium Economy. Payment went through, got the message from my bank that the amount was debited and the confirmation page came up. All good, right? The next day when it was time for online check in, they bumped us to the back of the plane. In a panic seeing as our seats were gone and there was only one pair of seats together that was remaining, I paid another $220 to book them and got the confirmation email from the airline as well as the message from the bank. Called customer service, I had to explain it to the agent about 5 or 6 times until he understood the issue. He said he forwarded it to the refund department and they will call me in an hour. You can maybe guess whether or not they actually called. Got to the airport with our boarding passes only for the check-in employee to tell us that somehow I'm not checked in and he's unable to do it. He had to call the supervisor to override it. We had a 1h20m transit in Abu Dhabi so it was going to be tight, but of course our flight left an hour late and we arrived with only 40 mins to our next flight. Unfortunately we had to run the entire distance of the airport given the arriving flight and departing flight were on opposite ends of the airport. Finally the trip was over and we made it back to Oman safely yesterday. I woke up this morning to see a message from my bank that Etihad charged me a third time for the seats. So for an upgrade that should have cost $220, I ended up paying $660 so far. Got on the phone just now and the agent tells me "this happens and it should come back in your account within 15 days, we'll call you then to check. Avoid this airline and pay the extra difference on other airlines, it'll be worth not experiencing this one.

### "recommend never flying with Etihad"
I recently flew to Abu Dhabi to compete in the World Triathlon Finals with my $7000 triathlon bicycle and gear in a separate bike box. Etihad lost my bicycle box in two airports: Frankfurt and Abu Dhabi. My bike & gear arrived 5 days late so I couldn't use it for the race. This ruined my opportunity to successfully compete for Team Canada at the World Triathlon Championships that I qualified and trained years for. This was devastating for me, as it would be for any athlete. I had to go to the airport in Abu Dhabi to find my bike box - I wasn't given any notification from Etihad staff that it was on the plane or that it had arrived. Etihad staff walked me all around the airport, bringing me to random corners to ask if different boxes looked like my bike. Anyone could have walked out with my bike if they had left it in the hallways they showed me. When I filed a complaint, Etihad offered me $50 US for the inconvenience, but their webpage was broken so I couldn't get the money. When I emailed their staff for help to receive the funds, their baggage assistance staff closed my customer complaint account! So I received no compensation for the delayed bike box and the huge stress this caused me. Secondly, the Etihad staff at the Frankfurt gate at first told me I missed my flight even though the plane was sitting there. They finally let me on after 20min of talking amongst themselves. When I walked on to the plane, someone was in my seat. I stood in the plane for about 15min while Etihad staff unsuccessfully addressed the man in my seat who wouldn't budge. So I had to sit in his seat in order to sit somewhere. I would highly recommend never flying with Etihad - the incompetence and unhelpfulness of the baggage, airport, airline, and customer complaint staff was absolutely astounding.

### "cabin crew are so rude"
Not Verified |  I will never be flying with this airline again and I encourage anyone to stay away from them. The cabin crew are so rude on all four of our flights. I certainly do not recommend flying with them with a young baby, the treatment we got was disgusting. Not only were the cabin rude and not helpful at all hardly anything worked. On the flight out tv was broken and half the toilets, which was great for a 14 hr flight. Should be ashamed of yourselves and the way your cabin crew behave. Pressed the buzzer so many times and nobody even came.

### "may want to avoid this airline"
One of my worst encounters with an airline. I found 2 damaged luggage after taking Etihad Airways flights from Paris to Abu Dhabi to Singapore on 30 Nov 2022. Since then, it has been a nightmare filing my claim with them. You will understand when you go through the entire process on their website. It has been more than 5 weeks, I really don't understand why they make it so difficult for their customers, as if to discourage us from doing so. There is no sense of customer service at all. To my horror, the baggage claim officer wrote to say he has closed my case, even after I have provided all the photos and forms. Etihad Airways can keep the measly compensation offer of US$100. I am sharing this unfortunate incident with other travelers so they won't go through the same painful experience as me. You may want to avoid this airline. Otherwise buy lots of insurance to protect yourself beforehand!

### "it felt like a low cost carrier"
Not Verified |  On January 3rd, my flight with Etihad Airways from Brussels to Abu Dhabi was extremely uncomfortable. Boarding process at Brussels Airport was extremely disorganised as no one paid attention to the boarding announcements as it was a full flight. The flight was not peaceful at all, as most children kept screaming and crying on the flight and I couldn't get any sleep at all. My tray table was broken, they never served any good food on the flight, it felt like a low cost carrier like Scoot, AirAsia, others. Etihad Airways has atrocious service, rude flight attendants, poor communication, not impressed. Lots of room for improvement!

### "stay away from this airline"
At the destination luggage missing ground staff doesn't offer any help no assistance whatsoever luggage delivered after 4 days damaged. Again customer service non-existent. MNL- BRU wanted to purchase extra luggage online not possible, was told to purchase that extra baggage at the counter on the day of travel. Of course, they wanted to charge per kilo,  impossible to take that extra on the day. Best of the best the "dinner" picture speaking by itself. Advise stay away from this airline.

### "Flight attendants outright rude"
Not worth the money paid. Business class service similar to that of a public tram. Flight attendants outright rude, haven’t seen this attitude even in Economy. No bed linen or turndown service, as different from Emirates/Turkish business class. Coffee machine not working, for which I haven’t received even an apology. Air Dhabi airport is a joke compared to Dubai, Istanbul or Singapore, not fit for a decent layover. Business lounges packed with crying babies and dirty pampers. Literally every sit packed, people playing videos and TikTok’s on high volume. Staff chit chatting all flight with each other instead of serving customers. Not once has anyone asked whether everything was fine or I needed anything. The chitchat was so loud I had trouble sleeping. I had to ask the staff to keep it quiet, a request that they completely ignored, all for the 3500€ ticket price! As if this wasn’t enough, the “epitome” of the flight was at the end. The business class toilet was occupied for a long time, when the door opened, a flight attendant came out. I rushed in to brush my teeth and discovered a think air of electronic cigarette smoke (you cannot confuse this smell with anything!). So apart from customer negligence, poor service and low value for the money, this airline’s own employees are breaking the law and international flight regulations.

### "I recommend choosing another airline"
Not Verified |  The first flight from Moscow to Bangkok was ok, but the service on the plane, the food and the general condition of the plane did not match the cost of the flight. I encountered a rather nasty attitude from the flight attendants when I asked about food options, got the answer "we are not a restaurant". The airport in Abu Dhabi is very inconvenient, outdated and stuffy, it is difficult to deal with transfers. But the most unpleasant thing happened during the return flight. Due to connection problems, I was 10 minutes late for check-in, so I called the office to warn and ask to wait. Absolutely all the airlines that I flew before agreed to help, even if I was late for 20 minutes. As a result, I faced not only a refusal to help, but also received boorish claims in my address that I was an irresponsible passenger and no one should go towards me like me. In addition to the completely unsatisfactory quality of the language of the representative of the company, she behaved very rudely towards me. I may be irresponsible, but I think that a major airline has no right to treat their customers like this. Especially for the price Etihad charges for their services. If you don't want to assist your clients, at least do it politely. I came to the check-in desk exactly 6 minutes late, the airline staff were no longer there. If you do not want to experience such an attitude towards yourself, I recommend choosing another airline, since now there is a large choice, even among Arab airlines. The service, food and aircraft condition of Etihad is also the worst of Arab airlines.

### "flight was disappointing"
Not Verified |  I was very disappointed and uncomfortable with how Etihad Airways was treating me on a 6 hour flight from Abu Dhabi to Brussels on December 15th. This was one of the worst overnight flights I have ever experienced in Economy Class. The inflight entertainment system was very poor and was glitching, I expected the flight to be good but it was horrible! The flight was disappointing, the airline needs to upgrade their services. Next time I will never choose Etihad Airways for travel!

### "did not provide me any room for stop-over"
It was mentioned on Etihad Airways that they will provide accomodation for stop-over of more than 10 hours. My stop-over was around 23 hrs but Etihad said they dont have any rooms left. They did not provide me any room for stop-over and said no rooms available for your dates. I was trying to book room about 4 months ago. I booked the room in Abu Dhabi Airport Hotel and interestingly it was the same hotel Etihad Airways told me that there are no rooms left. They lied to me. I dont recommend to travel with Etihad if you have stop-over of more than 2-3 hours.

### "don't book Etihad Airways"
On 11th November 2022, I reached Dublin airport and I found my baggage was damaged and things were out in baggage belt, anyhow I managed and collected all my luggage but not found my trimmer and my bug was totally damaged. Then I asked help from airport baggage help desk and they file report of damage baggage but no one help me at that moment to change the bug and give me new one so I can put my belongings into it, anyhow I manage it and stick a bug with sellotape which I got from one of the airport staff. I had request on Etihad Airways website but not got any solution from them. I suggest you all don't book Etihad Airways.

### "no compensation would be given"
Arrived in Abu Dhabi to discover a wheel missing on my, otherwise undamaged, suitcase. Raised complaint. Then had to fill in online feedback form and submit documents. After several weeks was asked for proof of purchase (Which I had already provided). Had to resubmit all previous documents as well as the receipt. Then told that no compensation would be given for baggage over 5 years old. So, if your bag is more than 5 years old they can smash a wheel off it and deny liability. Rubbish customer care (although they were grateful for giving them the opportunity to review my case. They look forward to welcoming me back on board - I think not. Now I have to buy a new suitcase at my own expense. The flight wasn't great either. Cramped. Lousy food.

### "Horrible food. Terrible airport"
Not Verified | Horrible food. Terrible airport in Abu Dhabi. Dirty and lack of facilities. Only one lounge for such a huge airport! No proper food court. Never more.

### "airport experience was one of the worst"
The airport experience was one of the worst due to the fact that Etihad outsources the local Thai company which can boast of having the worst and most unfriendly staff. The worst person was the duty manager who even mocked at my wife who was a wheelchair patient. The lounge was outsourced as well and was a pathetic dump. Luckily I had a priority pass and could use other lounges. Boarding started on time and the flight was packed in every seta. The plane was dated but the service was overall very good by the Etihad crew. IFE was not bad and the food quality was very nice. Wifi packages were reasonable and I was able to buy it using my miles. The best part was that we landed 50 minutes ahead of schedule which was wonderful!

### "Don’t waste your money booking seats"
My sister and I flew from Singapore to Manchester. Although the booking was made through lastminute.com I chose my return seats direct with Etihad. I paid for them and both on row 44 yet when I got on the plane someone was sat in my seats and refused to move. When I looked at my boarding card I’d been given different seats to the ones I’d pre booked. I was very unhappy with this confusion and it would definitely put me off booking with Etihad again. Please see below. What’s worse is no one from the airline cares at all that they’ve stolen my money. No one has replied to the 6 emails I’ve sent. It’s £45 ! I don’t care about the money it’s just disgusting, arrogant and theft. I flew 7 weeks ago now. I will always look to fly with other airlines form now on. Don’t waste your money booking seats.

### "will never fly with them again"
Horrible airline and will never fly with them again. I tried to upgrade 2nd leg of my journey. They said my bid not successful and i can increase my bid. Which I tried failed as their website not allowed. 3 -4 hrs before 2nd check in at Abu Dhabi airport got mail saying there is issue with charging me for my upgrade bid. Which I fixed and they charged my card. Then drama started. Not getting confirmation, approached transfer desk 3 times they said call call center. Called them being told connect to transfer desk. After ping pong finally able grab call centre they said checking with other team what is happening. Same happened with 3 consultants 3 times by the time after 10-15 call got disconnected. Tried to chat they said wait for confirmation mail. Boarding started, flight about close in 20 min, called again 4 time was told call back to check status in 10 min. Called again 5th tome after 10 min just before flight close , was finally for answer we its system error they sent email and charged my card , though business seats available, i got error mail saying my bid success wrong charge. Traveling with my daughter and anguish they caused both of us. After 14 hr flight from Sydney to Abu Dhabi and 14 hr layover at airport, not even proper seating available and paid lounge fully booked. They supposed to provide hotel for long gap, was told rudely at Sydney airport they dont provide hotel as it was my choice to take later flight with 14 hr layover. I tried to explain to her, she is adamant there is earlier flight. Finally what a horrible trip.

### "disappointed with the schedule changes"
Very disappointed with the schedule changes. My flights were changed 5 to 6 times after I had booked. Finally I rebooked a flight with them and the flight got delayed after I took the first leg. I am not sure if they are attracting day tourists by doing this!

### "they reimburse only hotels in Abu Dhabi"
Me and my wife booked a flight from Melbourne to Greece with Etihad for November 11, 2022. After spending several hours in the plane, the flight was finally cancelled and at 3AM they told us to look for a hotel ourselves, something we did. The next day we went to the Etihad desk at Melbourne airport and they told us that we will get reimbursed for our hotel expenses (two tickets stayed in one room). They told us to submit the papers through their website. One the 12th we flew to Greece with Emirates and arrived on the 13th. I have been trying to find the forms and the site to submit the necessary paperwork but after two days I was not able to discover anything. Today I called their customer service in Greece and in Emirate and the amazing answer they gave me is that they reimburse only hotels in Abu Dhabi! I told them this was not fair since I am not asking any compensation for the over 24-hour delay involving two passengers but only to pay for my hotel. The answer was still the same no compensation for hotels outside Abu Dhabi. Conclusion: Etihad lied to me in Melbourne about hotel compensation. They did absolutely nothing for the long delay. While waiting in the airplane for several hours they offered us water and some salty pretzels. Completely unacceptable.

### "product is much better than Emirates First"
Abu Dhabi to Geneva in First on a 787-9. Probably the best flight I had. Crew was outstanding, formal and professional, yet engaging with passengers. The seat is stunning, very roomy, elegant, and does not feel claustrophobic. Food was extremely good: the menu is not that extensive but the quality of every dish is very high. You can order anything from the onboard menu, at any time. Pajamas provided are designed by a local Emirati brand A Friend Of Mine: drawing inspiration from traditional Emirati dress, I found these pajamas to be incredibly soft and comfortable. Amenity kit is stocked with Acqua di Parma products. In my opinion, this First class product is much better than Emirates First. Some areas of improvement: no amenities are offered in the toilet; WiFi quality and speed could be better (First passengers are given 200MB for free); champagne could be enhanced (Etihad serves Charles Heidsieck 2006, both Brut and Rosé, while Singapore Airlines, e.g., serves Krug in First). Other than that, a flight close to perfection. The First Class Lounge & SPA at Abu Dhabi airport is beautifully designed and worth spending at least 2 hours.

### "3½ hours of mediocrity"
Beirut to Abu Dhabi in Economy. 3½ hours of mediocrity. The seat is pretty thin, and comes without any kind of screen for personal entertainment. You can watch movies via the onboard streaming system but the seat does not feature any kind of support for your smartphone. I ordered a low-calorie meal which was ok, but too much plastic is being used (starting from the cutlery). Some crew members looked annoyed by passenger requests. Plane was a 7 year-old A321 which was clean and in great condition. Out of the Gulf carriers and Turkish Airlines, Etihad provides the worst product in Economy class on a narrow body plane.

### "Etihad just overbooks flights"
Not Verified |  Etihad just overbooks flights, 9 people could not board! My flight was over booked by 9people, even if we had a Ticket 3months ago bought. We didn't get a seat and had to watch the plane leaving without us.

### "Very disappointed"
I was supposed to fly from ORD to Abu Dhabi (22nd Oct) and Abu Dhabi to KTM (24th Oct). 4 days before the flight, they canceled my connecting flight from Abu Dhabi to KTM. They offered me a 23rd Oct flight ticket but I had to reach Ktm by 24th Oct so I asked them to prepone flight instead of postponing. Though it was totally their fault to cancel the flight at the last hour, they asked me to pay 487 dollar extra for my rescheduled flight. After spending 1 and half hour pleasing them, they deducted 200 dollar and offered me reschedule by paying 287 extra. It is very inconvenient to cancel a flight at the last hour and make customers pay extra for the flight. It was their responsibility to offer a convenient reschedule flight option to customers free of charge when they are canceling a flight. Very disappointed.

### "Very small portion of food served"
1. Very small portion of food served during the flight. 2. Long queue at check-in counter. I waited for 1.5 hours despite of not over crowded. 3. Partnership with several airlines and credit cards are discontinued. 4. Poor customer service to solve the missing mileage due to the termination of partnership airlines

### "Most disappointing experience"
Most disappointing experience. My flight has been changed 4 times, made me stay in Abu Dhabi without any prior notice. Manager on the counter didn’t care about my issue. I don’t recommend to fly with Etihad.

### "experience before boarding is simply horrible"
I have a reservation from Detroit (US) to Hyderabad (IND) via JFK and AUH. I have checked in all my luggage at DTW for Jet Blue from DTW to JFK and I wasn’t told there would be a charge or I will not be allowed to carry both carry on and back pack with Laptop. At JFK I had to wait for the Etihad counters to open for more than an hour, once the counter is open they asked us to move to a line and had us wait for 40 mins to start/open the counters. I had to wait just to collect the boarding pass because I couldn’t get them from online. When I reached the counter they charged me 60$ as I am carrying a backpack for my laptops. They just said they changed the policy from July which is ridiculous. The overall experience before boarding the flight is simply horrible. Never book through Etihad especially when having a internal transfer with in USA.

### "affordable but not glamourous"
Not Verified |  We flew Etihad to Rome Fiumicino and back via Abu Dhabi ,it was good but not great. When we got the airport check in was smooth however we had booked a bulkhead seats for all flights for my dads 50th but since they changed the plane from a 787-9 to a 777-300 meaning that we couldn't access the bulkheads seats and the Etihad staff were rude and refused to give a refund and we had to pay more for fees. The plane was older than expected, Inflight entertainment screens were tricky and average quality and it was showing its age. food on both flights were bland and repetitive meat rice and veggies but they offered drinks consistently, The layover in Abu Dhabi was terrible and lines were long the second leg from Abu Dhabi to Rome the 787 was better and easier to sleep in. Overall Etihad is affordable but not glamourous.

### "damaged my hard case bag"
Poor service from most staff, bad and salty foods, damaged my hard case bag. Will not choose this airline given a choice and won't recommend. My outbound flight in September got a damaged table too

### "seat very confortable"
Amazing and professional Cabin Crew, the aircraft was clean, new and seat very confortable. Cabin senior on this flight was walking at all time and checking on passenger, she did ask me fourth times if everything was okay., Thank you Etihad airways

### "money still isn't back in my account"
The leg from Melbourne to Abu Dhabi and Abu Dhabi to Melbourne was the worst flight of my life, both ways. I've flown the route from Melbourne to Vienna many times with Emirates, Qatar, Qantas, this was hands down the worst experience by far. Not only was the plane for this 13 hour flight 20+ years old, the seats were unbelievably uncomfortable, the bathrooms were filthy, on the first flight the toilet flushing button was smashed and covered in filth. The food was awful. On returning home, I looked to see if I could book a premium economy seat to alleviate the discomfort. The website told me the seats I selected were unavailable, but charged me 222.00 $ each time I clicked a seat. I was charged multiple times for seats that were unavailable. I immediately called Etihad and asked them to refund me. I was told I wasn't charged and my bank would release the funds in 24 hours. On the flight in question I was given one of the worst seats, in the very back of the plane in a seat that didn't recline. 5 days later, the money still isn't back in my account. I call again and say I'm going to dispute with my bank, they ask for 24 more hours to reverse the charge. It's been three days, a total of over a week. They're still keeping my money.

### "I had the worst experience"
I had the worst experience with Etihad Airways among all the flights that I've took so far. On July 31st i had a flight from Incheon, South Korea to Istanbul. After I received my baggage it was dented and cracked in some places and I got a report that it was unrepairable. I contacted the airlines about the issue but they refused to cover the damage and closed the case right away. I don't recommend anyone to fly with this company.

### "will not fly with them again"
Upon booking my flight, they recommended a 12 transit stopover at Abu Dhabi airport with the promise that they will provide a hotel. After months of chasing them to say the website is showing an error (invalid PNR - even though ticket was issued and confirmed), they completely ignored my emails, made me run around, kept buying time, eventually telling me I had to book after I completed my first leg (which I did). and when I arrived at the airport and said I have been trying for months, they acknowledged that I had in fact talked to them but still proceeded to refuse me a hotel. I had to end up paying from my pocket and all this time that I spent chasing them up was completely wasted. I asked if there is an office or desk in the airport where I can lodge a complaint, they said there's none! Terrible service, will not fly with them again.

### "worst flight experience I have had"
My wife and myself were on a flight from Melbourne to Athens via Abu Dhabi. At first the flight was delayed slightly, according to the captain to wait on a couple of last minute passengers, which I understand. 15 minutes later, he announced again that we were going to be a little more due to some cargo taking longer than usual to load. When we finally took off, it was a little over an hour after the initial flight time. Once we were in the air, i decided to plug in the earphones provided to watch a movie but the plug wasn't working properly so i plugged in my double adapter to use my own headphones. Once again, it didn't work properly, I could barely hear anything and when there was sound it was distorted, and the contrast on the screen even after adjustment was horrible to the point where i gave up and opened my tablet instead. About 4 hours before landing breakfast was being served, and I was asked what i would like to drink and i said orange juice. When the stewardess was putting the tray down, she knocked over the cup of juice all over my lap which ended up running down my leg, into my socks and shoes. She finished serving breakfast and 15 minutes later she came to me with wet wipes after i had already cleaned up all the mess. After waiting about half hour without anyone coming to see if i needed anything, i kept ringing my bell for someone to come, only for that light to keep getting put out. When someone finally did come and i explained my situation, he responded with "What do you want me to do about it?". Not only did no one offer to look for a change of pants, but wasn't even offered to be moved to another seat, or even just putting a towel or something over the seat so i didn't have to sit on an orange juiced soaked seat. This was the worst flight experience I have had with any airline. Our flight home back to Melbourne is with Etihad and we hope that that trip is a better experience that the initial one. In our minds, we thought that Etihad had a decent level of standards compared to some other airlines, but our experience showed otherwise, and perhaps our flight home can make up for the bad experience that we had.

### "owes me $2000 for damaged baggage"
Etihad owes me $2000 for damaged baggage on a business class ticket back in early March. They have asked for receipts which have been provided no less than 13 times over 6 months. Every email is ignored. I have screenshots that are attached. No help from customer service centre or Facebook messenger. If you fly this airline and have a problem you will have the worst customer service of your life. You will get no help. I just got back from a trip with Singapore Airlines. I had a small problem that the call centre resolved quickly with very little hold time. A better onboard product too. Etihad has no respect for us customers. Go elsewhere, there are much better airlines out there.

### "They nickel and dime you"
Abu Dhabi to Riyadh. I reserved a flight and picked aisle seats on Etihad weeks in advance. Sometime thereafter, they changed my seats to a middle seat and did not inform me at all. I only found out when I went to check in online, and when I changed to a different seat, they CHARGED ME AGAIN for the new seat! Another $30 USD for correcting their mistake! I complained on their web site, but only got a canned response of "seat fees are not refundable. Horrible service. They nickel and dime you and don't care about you after you've paid. Will never fly them again.

### "Easily the worst airline experience"
Not Verified |  Easily the worst airline experience we’ve had to date. Firstly-we got to the airport for an extremely early morning flight with our bags packed only to be told our tickets didn’t include checked baggage (no where when booking these tickets was this mentioned-we didn’t even know Etihad would have this option as this is usually only for domestic flights or low budget airlines!). After the rude customer service attendant refused to help us, we had to pay 100 AED PER KG. Annoyed already, we got on the flight to a terrible plane, no screens, old seats and one working bathroom for all economy passengers.

### "No water or food provided"
Not Verified | Athens to Singapore via Abu Dhabi. Firstly paid for a flight that we thought was at least 787. It’s a 787 between Singapore to Abu Dhabi however to Athens either way you get a 320 with no screen. Delayed our flight whilst on the tarmac by 2 hours missing our connecting flight. No correspondence given from ground or on air staff. No water or food also provided for four hours. Best option was us to fly to India and then fly with Air India paid by Etihad. We rejected and had to buy our own flights home with Singapore Airlines - currently awaiting reimbursement.

### "none of the 3 checked-in baggage arrived"
I travelled through Etihad Airlines from Chennai to Chicago via Abu Dhabi. I reached Chicago, ORD on 03 Aug with a delay of around 3 hrs. But none of the 3 checked-in baggage arrived. We were given a contact number for Etihad baggage at ORD. No one responds to this number & it always goes to a voice mail. Most of the passenger did not receive their check-in baggage as there was a last minute flight change. They made me check-in my cabin baggage and now not responding at all through email or phone. We raised a Claim for delayed baggage & observed that the claim status is still not updated in the portal. It remains as "TRACING CONTINUES. PLEASE CHECK BACK LATER". No news about the baggage status for 7 days & I finally got an email that they are sending all 3 bags to Charlotte airport as my location is Charlotte. But I got only 2 bags delivered through American Airlines. When verified with American Airlines customer care, they updated that only 2 baggage came through this flight. The other baggage was not loaded in this flight. Also both the bags that were delivered through AA flight are severely damaged and broken. No update from Etihad Baggage team or the Chicago baggage handling team on the missing bag for 13 days as on 16 Aug 2022. The service from Etihad baggage team is totally unacceptable and causing too much of stress due undue delay in baggage delivery, multiple follow-ups with no response, multiple visits to airport, additional efforts from our side with no certainty in timelines.

### "money that was taken from me for no reason"
I have been messaging, emailing, calling Etihad to explain and return money that was taken from me for no reason. I have explained it to at least 3 people, and the response is always, we'll get back to you. This is not a case of refunding. This is simply a case of a cancelled booking, where the money was refunded then taken again. I didn't make another booking, I didn't use the ticket and I certainly did raise a complaint and explained it in detail. What does Etihad do - nothing. They hire multiple different partners it seems, each from a different region and they are impossible to connect you with someone from actual headquarters. I have been promised a call for the past 2 days.

### "just atrocious and money hungry"
Not Verified | London to Sydney via Abu Dhabi. Avoid this horrific company at all costs. Booked tickets to my grandmothers memorial in March in England. Come time to return from London and at the airport, the customer service assistant tells me “there might not be a seat for me”. I ask her to clarify as I have family in London and would rather stay there than in Abu Dhabi as I am alone. She doesn’t respond and I make it on the plane. Confusing woman. None the less I got on the plane and arrive in Abu Dhabi, wait at the gate for 3 hours for my connecting flight, and within the final 5 minutes they tell me I am unable to board the flight as it was over booked. The horrible man at customer service offered me a ticket TWO DAYS LATER. I vehemently denied this. Next flight was 14 hours later with a stop off to Melbourne. I’ve missed the entire day of work. You cannot be serious that a long haul flight over books. That’s just atrocious and money hungry - shame on this airline. Never before experienced such hideous, appalling customer service or lack of accountability from a company. Not a sorry in sight and all of their workers seem to act as if it is their first day - no one has a clue what they are doing. It’s the strangest experience. They gave me a voucher for a meal which could only be used at Burger King or a random Curry House which understandably doesn’t seem appealing before travelling for 14 hours. The voucher didn’t even buy a coffee. What on earth! They also gave me a $300 USD voucher for my troubles. Went in the trash straight away. Never had such a terrible experience and would NEVER recommend to anyone. Shameful and an embarrassment to their country.

### "worst in customer service"
Absolutely the worst in customer service from the booking process to the agents at the airport who have no knowledge what so ever about entry requirements to any country. All they care about is money, they are rude and extremely unprofessional.

### "I recommend Etihad Airways"
Long trip to Thailand for a family of four, including two kids of 12 and 10 years old. I recommend Etihad Airways for professionnalism, the friendliness of its crew, and general reliability. All flights on-time, no luggage problem. Comfortable Boeing 787 with rich in-flight entertainment. The density in economy class is high, but this is understandable given the low ticket price. Abu Dhabi is not the newest and most comfortable airport for a connection, but it's not a big deal.

### "Horrible customer service"
Not Verified |  What an absolute nightmare and waste of $1,200. I had a flight credit for a canceled flight, but their website gives me a "card" error every time I try to use my travel bank credit, even with the flight being cheaper than my travel bank credit balance displayed on the payment page. I called Etihad to book the flight via phone and they are charging almost $100 to book the flight over the phone as a guest service fee. I emailed them screenshots of the payment screen with my travel bank balance, and they said it is not a valid reason to waive the $100 travel bank fee. Our original flight was booked during COVID from Kuala Lumpur back to Istanbul, where we were living. They canceled the flight within 24 hours of booking, and would only issue a travel credit. They were intentionally keeping bookings open for flight routes that they were canceling to collect airfares and turn them into travel credits. Horrible customer service. Avoid at all costs. I'm choosing to sacrifice my entire travel credit over paying them some BS $100 fee to talk to someone on the phone because their website sucks.

### "rude and unprofessional"
Dhaka to New York via Abu Dhabi. Very bad experience and they changed our original flight to a 13 our transit and refused to give us hotel. Staff are very rude and unprofessional. Never again Etihad.

### "I would not recommend this airline"
Not Verified |  Worst airline I’ve tried!! We took 4 planes from Qatar to Bahrain and back through Abu Dhabi, 3 of those flights got delayed. In one of the flights we had to sit in the aircraft without ventilation or AC for almost half an hour in a crowded flight. Not to mention The staff is not friendly at all and the tickets were pricy. I would not recommend this airline.

### "did not impress me with service"
Not Verified |  We booked 4 flights from Vienna to Seychelles and back. Every flight had issues. 1st flight delayed for 3 hours without any explanation given to passengers. I was not able to check-in online with economy seat as none were available anymore despite fact I logged in at the precise time check-in opened. Had to pay 160euro for economy space and the seat did not recline & was broken. But to my surprise I also noticed free economy seats during flight. Wasted money. 2nd flight was a night flight and crew was waking up all passengers to serve food, there should be a better way to do it. On Way back we could not start check-in bags at airport as their system failed. Main flight back from Abu Dhabi to Vienna did not serve alcohol. why? We arrived 15 minutes ahead of schedule only to be left 45 minutes without any ventilation in the plane, as crew did not agree a car to drive the passengers to airport. In general, I cannot understand why a "premium" airline does not want to dock the plane to the airport but wants their passengers to board/ disembark from cars in 40 degrees. Flight crew did not impress me with service.

### "will fly them again"
Etihad delivers a fine product from the ground to the air. Once onboard was shown to my seat by the cabin manager and served a glass of champagne and fresh orange juice. So much food was on offer and I ate my fair share. Cabin crew constantly asking if I was fine and needed anything. The seat was so comfortable and loved the massage function and the ability to change the cushion from soft to hard giving the best seat comfort. A sensational amount of movies and TV shows to keep you awake the whole flight. Really impressed with Etihad and will fly them again.

### "staff did absolute minimum only"
Masks still have to be worn on board, that it getting a bit old. Felt that staff did absolute minimum only, much much interaction with guests. Needed assistance with luggage when boarding (accident), a flight attendant assisted, but I was on my own after landing, nobody cared. No free WiFi in business class Food was fine, good wheelchair service after landing in Abu Dhabi.

### "consoling messages but absolutely zero/no action"
I received a sms from Etihad Airlines at 1am 1st July stating our 1st flight (EY463) was delayed so I stayed up and phoned Etihad to be told the sms was an error and received an email within 10 minutes from Etihad confirming the original flight time - but this was wrong as there was actually a delay. I phoned again during the day and waited on hold so long that our transport arrived to take us to the airport for the original timed flight so we then had to wait at the airport for 6 hours (not 3). Etihad staff at the airport told us that all connecting flights would be delayed for all passengers so we would not miss our connecting flights. However we received an updated itinerary stating our connecting flight would depart 9 minutes before we were due to arrive in Abu Dhabi (even I know no one can go backwards in time). We arrived in Abu Dhabi ahead of schedule and ran (we are 60 years old) to the connecting flight's gate showing Last Call (after pushing our way through security) to be told that our baggage had been offloaded which is impossible because our plane had only reached the arrival gate 12 minutes before and there were 400+ passengers with luggage so how could our luggage be singled out and transferred to the connecting flight's aircraft and then offloaded in 12 minutes? We stood in line at the Departure/Arrival Transfer desk for 2 hours (I had to ask Etihad staff to bring water for the 100+ passengers waiting as it was 30+ oC in the building) and we were given a voucher for a 5 star hotel for my 60th Birthday but Etihad had not checked vacancies so after reaching the downstairs Transfer desk, we were told the 5 star hotel had no spare rooms so we waited 1 more hour to be transferred to the Ibis hotel. As our final destination did not require PCR tests, we had not been PCR tested (we had used Rapid Antigen tests at home and were COVID negative) so we had to stay in our hotel room and not use any hotel facilities. We had slept through lunch (after arriving in Abu Dhabi at 2.20am but not reaching the hotel until 7am) and had to eat a salad and fruit instead of a proper meal. I even asked for ice-cream and was told I had to pay. (We spoke to other passengers after their stay in Abu Dhabi who were not restricted from using their Hotel's restaurants and facilities. So why were we restricted to our rooms?). Etihad (on Facebook Messenger) had told me that the hotel Concierge would have to contact Etihad to arrange transfer back to the airport 3 hours before the connecting flight but the hotel Concierge phoned many times and Etihad never answered the phone (the phone was busy or did not connect). After waiting and waiting until there was only 2.5 hours before departure I paid for 7 people to travel in taxis back to the airport. I had been in contact with Etihad Support using Facebook Messenger and received consoling messages but absolutely zero/no action. I was told to wait and there would be action but there was no action at all.

### "she was unapologetic, unhelpful and unhappy"
Not Verified |  What started off as a much awaited business- cum -pleasure trip to the UK (Manchester) from Malaysia (KL)for my wife and I and our kids was going well and fine till our return leg from Manchester to Abu Dhabi where my wife had problems lifting her hand carry luggage to the overhead cabin and requested for cabin crew assistance to which one of them agreed to. My wife was on one side of the aisle in business class while I was beside her on the other side separated by a barrier and so couldn't help her. Incidentally, both of us are elderly in our mid 60's and she had just had a Left knee joint replacement surgery done barely 2 months ago. Before the cabin crew came to help, the cabin flight manager came and she ordered me to put the bags up for my wife without asking about our health problems. When I tried to explain, she asked to go around to the other side of the aisle to do it and walked away. I didn't have time to do it as we were about to take off but a cabin crew came and helped without any fuss. Immediately after the plane took off and started cruising, this unpleasant lady cabin manager came, introduced herself and sternly told me care of our hand luggage is our sole personal responsibility and not the duty of any of her crew to help! Despite my explaining, she was unapologetic, unhelpful and unhappy. She certainly spoiled my day and made me lose any respect for the airline. Her rudeness, unprofessional behaviour embarassed me in front of my family and the other passengers.

### "they refuse to refund"
Bangkok to Paris via Abu Dhabi booked for June 2020. Bad service, they refuse to refund when the airline cancel their flight in June 2020. I have contacted them so many times and it always direct me to the call centre where hardly speak English.

### "Two great flights"
Not Verified |  Outbound Business, and return economy Two great flights both on time. Great food and beverage and one of the best crews I’ve experienced- nothing was too much trouble. Very engaged and very professional. Etihad crew I’ve always found one of the best. Kudos to Etihad the experience was like the old days.

### "I wont book Etihad again"
Not Verified | Do you believe that after completing the online check-in process, we still need to stand in line for 2 hours in the airport to get your boarding passes. The airport staff from Etihad Airways are the worst i have ever seen. Inside the flight they refuse to provide hot water to feed the milk to children (we need to beg them for hot water 2 to 3 times), if the child cries they will ask you to take them to Restroom for calming. The Veg food (Cucumber salad) provided in the 13 hour flight (IAD to AUH) was stale and greasy. I wont book Etihad again.

### "demanded that we provide Thaipass"
I, along with my wife and three small children were supposed to fly on flight EY66 / EY430 from Moscow to Bangkok. When checking in our luggage, the airline representative refused to check us in for the flight and demanded that we provide Thaipass. I was not informed that this could be a reason for denial of registration. However, I applied for a Thaipass at the time of check-in, and begged the airline representative to delay check-in from 10.55 am to 11.15 am, with the flight scheduled to depart at 11.55 am. Sheremetyevo airport is not busy. Despite my requests, the representative of the airline finished check-in and left the airport at 11.00. at 11.15 am I received a letter saying that all members of my family received a Thaipass, which allowed me to fly to Thailand. I contacted the Etihad representative by phone and asked to find a way to get on the flight, given that I went through online check-in in advance. All my requests were answered in the negative. In addition, our return tickets were automatically cancelled. In addition to air tickets, I paid for hotel accommodation in Thailand, and a lot of related expenses. It is impossible to describe the state of my family, given the lack of opportunities to change or buy new tickets.

### "not to use this company for flights with pets"
Terrible service for those who want to fly with pets in cabin. You cannot plan a trip with this company as the department does not give you answer for ages (btw I called either local cc in Russia and international one in UAE). The calls to support center does not give you anything because they can only verify if there is room for your pet or no. They can only write a letter to this pet department! First time I called the international department, they wrote this letter and said that the dept should answer in 24 hours but we didn't get any answer! Same story with my local department. And all the time when all this happened, I couldn't be sure in my future plans as they do not book this place for your pet. By the way, people in support center are polite and ok in terms of their professional capabilities. All in all I strongly recommend not to use this company for your flights with pets as you cannot be sure in your future plans.

### "nightmare of an experience"
Amsterdam to Kochi via Abu Dhabi. It was an nightmare of an experience. The flight was about 2-3 hours delay and we missed the connecting flight. We were provided with tickets only on next day, We were given a cheap food voucher they took our passports for visa processing since the hotel was outside the airport. Even though we called earlier and confirmed that the hotel reservation will be provided inside the airport. They initially said it will take an hour or 2 but we had to wait with kids for more than 5 hours in cold uncomfortable chairs in the middle of the night around 2.00 am to get the visa for the hotel transfer. We asked them to let us in a lounge but they said it cannot be provided as per policy. Such rude attitude and behavior shown by the staff even after mentioning we had small kids. We have never had such a horrendous experience any time during our flight journey in our entire lives. My best advice is to never ever travel with this airlines.

### "I am making endless calls to call center"
Not Verified |  I want to make a serious complaint about the terrible lack of customer service at Etihad, for those flying with pets. Etihad is the only airline allowing pet in cabin in and outbound into UAE. However the service responsible for that does not have a phone and only communicates very sporadically and very vaguely by email. Calling the call centre is useless as these people just keep saying it is not their department. So we are facing strict deadlines with complex documents to submit, but no timely feedback from Etihad. Basically no feedback at all. I had to change my flight several times because of this and I am desperate, it feels like I will never get on this flight and I have sleepless nights. One phone call from the right department could have fixed all this. But now I am making endless calls to call center in the hope if could move something.

### "high service level"
Munich to Abu Dhabi. Flew to Abu Dhabi on the comfortable Business Studio product of Etihad. Always loved the hard product onboard and seeing that the soft product onboard has steadily improved over the past years makes me very happy. Upon entering the Dreamliner, I found the Wellness Kit onboard that features a few Covid related safety measurements, such as hand sanitisers and a mask. They also had the luxurious Acqua di Parma amenity kit ready as I took my seat, which is my all-time favorite Business Class amenity kit. The catering onboard was delicious with a choice of starters, mains and desserts and the all-day menu featuring a nice range of further meals. Crew was super attentive, remembered my preferences and ensured my well-being throughout the entire 6 hours flight from Munich to Abu Dhabi. It's nice to see Etihad back at their high service level. Excited for future trips on Etihad Airways!

### "This is just a delay tactic"
I was tested Covid positive at Bengaluru Airport labs (Auriga Research) and could not board the airline as a result. This was just a few hours from the departure of the flight to Toronto. This was on January 29th, 2022. I informed this to Etihad along with my passport and covid positive report details and was cooperative with them throughout the process. Since I could not board the flight due to being tested covid positive, I was subsequently asked to submit my passport information, report result, credit card used for the booking and the credit card statement multiple times to Etihad. I have been following up numerous times with the call centre at Etihad Refund department and all they say is wait for 45 days. It has been close to 120 days now, also their twitter help was useless as they too like the call centre employees ask me to wait for 45 days. They keep giving a random date on which the refund processing has started and ask me to wait for 45 days from that date - sometimes 45 business days, sometimes its 45 calendar days. This is just a delay tactic in the hope that I eventually give up. I have spent approximately 2300 CAD and used about 1800 CAD approximately through a travel bank. This is a large amount I paid for a one way trip but due to circumstances beyond my control I was unable to board the flight, how am I supposed to let go of such a large amount? Every time they ell me it is in processing and submitting a formal complaint on their website does not yield any results. I am really anxious now and look for some light at the end of the tunnel in the form of a refund.

### "Every single flight has had some delay"
Let me start by never recommending Etihad Airlines to anyone. I'm a student in Germany so I travel a lot back and forth between Germany and the Emirates, 3-4 times yearly. Every single flight that I have taken with Etihad has had some delay, issue, unprofessionalism, rudeness, and inexperience from their staff. Every time I travel they stop me at the counters and check my residency card for at least an hour, making me catch the flight literally in the last minutes before takeoff. One could argue that it's a standard procedure, but seriously it takes you an hour to verify an ID card rightfully issued by German authorities? Another thing that always happens is delays. The amount of delays that you experience with Etihad is unimaginable. Out of around 12 flights with them, at least 11 flights were delayed by 1-2 hours. Again, this wasn't a major issue for me because I usually choose holidays or weekends when traveling so it doesn't hurt my schedule a lot. However, this one time I had a flight from Hamburg (Germany) to Abu Dhabi (United Arab Emirates) with a connecting flight in Frankfurt booked through their official website. The first flight Hamburg to Frankfurt was delayed by one hour for technical reasons. However, the second flight from Frankfurt to Abu Dhabi was on time. You guessed it right, the first flight landed as my second flight was taking off. I called them and explained the situation several times after being transferred from one operator to another and the reply I got was (We'll book you the next flight tomorrow, and fortunately for you we will not charge you). Originally, my flight was on a Sunday at 2pm, now the new flight is on Monday 2pm. I called them and explained again my situation and demanded a compensation cause I'll be missing a full working day and also would need a place to stay to wait for my next flight and the operator said that I could file a compensation claim on their website with a receipt of the hotel and would be compensated accordingly. However, when I did that I was stuck with calling Etihad back and forth for at least a month before giving up. They blamed the connecting flight airlines for the delay, and when I explained that I booked my ticket through their website and that I do not have to do with what airline‘s fault was it as long as they‘re the ones that received the money, then they should solve such an incident and compensate me on that delay. Of course I didn‘t get a single penny from them, didn‘t even get an apology and was treated as if it was my fault for not catching the flight. All in all, a really horrible company, they treat their customers as if our flights are free and we didn't pay anything, no respect, no professionalism, literally nothing. I personally would travel the world on a bike if they were the only option.

### "Service is mostly rude and uninterested"
I fly to India a few times per year. I fly Economy and have flown with any and every airline. I was lured in by a great deal on a return flight to Mumbai. The catch was an extra stopover in Manchester. My bag was left in Manchester. It did not arrive in Mumbai. I missed my connecting flight to Goa. My bag took 5 days to recover. Daily contact with Etihad from my husband and from me by phone and email. In the end, the bag arrived - no apology, no notice. The flights I took were okay. Food is okay. Service is mostly rude and uninterested. One nice cabin crew member and the man who took my lost bag details was a great help. No air corridors. Busses to terminals. Rubbish website. No customer service. I've no doubt necessity will ensure I will fly with them again but make no mistake this is a budget airline pretending to be fancy. Disappointing.

### "I will never be travelling with them again"
The worst company I have ever dealt with. =Fake promotions that are not honoured and breech the UAE’s customer protection laws. Scheduled Abu Dhabi - Dubai coaches don't turn up, and you'll be left abandoned for hours in a carpark with no information or alternative transport. -No Etihad representatives present upon arrival, desk closed. Customer 'support' based on a drawn out system of misdirection and lies clearly designed to wear customers down and staff will claim ‘no authority’ to resolve anything. No response to submitting issues through their online system, don’t bother. Instructed by online departments to complain via phone and vice versa in an endless circle. I was continuously promised compensation and resolutions that were later denied on several occasions. Customer support staff refuse to provide anything in writing. On the following call, (that you will have to make when they don’t call/email back as promised), they deny everything you have previously agreed. I eventually spoke with a supervisor who told me he would personally call back within four hours, he did not, and then told his staff to pretend he had left the office when I called back, though it was clearly apparent that he was still there. I will never be travelling with them again on principle of their total lack of morals, respect, and basic decency.

### "I had a good experience on Etihad"
I flew in business class on Etihad to Amsterdam in April 2022. It was my first time flying with Etihad and it was an overnight flight with a stopover in Abu Dhabi. The first leg of the journey started off with dinner service. Etihad has a dine as you please policy in business class and I chose to have dinner immediately after take off. For starter I had the Arabic mezze and for the main I had prawn briyani. Both were tasty and full of flavour. The staff were attentive and the cabin manager introduced himself to business class passengers. The second leg of the journey departed AUH in the early hours of the morning. As it was too early to have breakfast, I requested for breakfast to be served 2 hours prior to arrival in Amsterdam. For breakfast I had the yoghurt with granola and the Arabic option. The hard product of the business class section is comfortable. The seating is arranged in a 1-2-1 configuration with even seats facing forward and odd number seats facing backwards. I chose the window seat facing forward. It had 2 windows of view. The tray table was large and heavy and provided good support. The seat was fully reclining and there was adequate space in the footwell for you to sleep straight. Do note that if you are sitting in the window seat and your seat is in the lounging position, you will need to use the pillow as an arm rest for the other arm. Storage space was adequate. Besides the overhead lockers, you have a side bin to store your accessories like cellphones etc. There was a touch screen controller from which you could select your entertainment options. The selection of Western movies was somewhat limited. The classical music channel was also limited. Wifi was available on board but it is on a paid basis but I did not avail myself of it. The amenity kit was by Acqua Parma and it contained a toothbrush, eyeshade, snood to cover your mouth and nose, and a bottle of cologne. A separate hygiene kit was provided which contained a surgical mask, hand sanitizer and wet wipes. Overall, I had a good experience on Etihad. The airfares were very reasonable considering that this is almost near the peak travel season after travel was severely impacted by the COVID19 pandemic. I would definitely fly with Etihad on business class again.

### "Everything was prefect"
Everything was prefect from check-in to boarding seat space and leg room, service on board and cleanliness. The in flight entertainment had current films and the hot meal was okay.

### "worst flight I experienced by far"
This was the worst flight I experienced by far. The flight had about 3-4 hours delay while at first we were told its about 30 mins to one hour! We and many other customers lost our connecting flight. And were offered next day flights. We were given a cheap food voucher with only one bottle of water or tea to choose from! In addition, they took our passports for visa processing since the hotel was outside the airport. They initially said it will take an hour or 2 but we had to wait much longer in cold uncomfortable chairs in the middle of the night to get the visa for the hotel transfer. We asked them to let us in a lounge but that was not a possibility. So we lost more than 1 day, where most of it was wasted waiting in the airport due to delay or visa preparation. I was tired, hungry, sick and without a change of cloths, i asked them for Panadol but even that was not possible, i had to buy it myself. I have never seen such a poor customer service - the staff were rude and expected us to be understanding without even proper apology. Avoid this airline if you have other options.

### "food and service on board was appalling"
The seat configuration on the Boeing 787 is 3-3-3 which means if you are unlucky enough to be in a window seat you have no chance of getting out of your seat to stretch your legs or go to the bathroom etc. You are basically trapped in your seat for the duration of the flight. The food and service on board was appalling. The food was literally inedible and they must have been short of staff because they were not to be found for most of the flight. Flying from Bangkok to Dublin via Abu Dhabi are two long flights and one would expect a better overall quality of service from a full service airline such as Etihad. With so much competition going on in the air with the various airlines it surprises me that Etihad are not better than they are. Don't even get me started on the two and a half hours in transit in Abu Dhabi.

### "coerced to pay additional 800 GBP"
Avoid Etihad Airways: I was coerced to pay additional 800 GBP for a confirmed return ticket from Abu Dhabi to London Heathrow. The incompetence of Etihad‘s call centre and IT system have led me to a last-minute purchase of a new ticket at the airport check-in counter in lieu of an already paid confirmed return ticket. Deceitful tricks.

### "changed my layover from 6 hours to 12 hours"
Not Verified |  They changed my layover from 6 hours to 12 hours on a whim. They give you three choices after changing your flight: 1. Accept 2. Reschedule the flight. If you reschedule you will have to pay for the price difference of the new flight and pay an additional $200.00. Technically it's credit -$200.00 on a flight that they changed and you have no say whatsoever. 3. Cancel. They get all your money and you get nothing in return.

### "deducting a cancellation fee"
Not Verified |  Booked a flight from London to Adelaide, transiting through Abu Dhabi and Melbourne. A couple of days after I booked and paid for flight, they wrote to me claiming that due to Australian Government caps on 'unvaccinated' passengers, they would not allow me to board the flight. They said that I could instead fly from Abu Dhabi to Melbourne the day before. That's great geniuses, but what about the legs from London to Abu Dhabi and from Melbourne to Adelaide? I asked Etihad this simple question twice  and twice they failed to answer. I cancelled the flight in disgust, requested a refund and rebooked with Singapore Airlines, who flew me the same day I was originally scheduled to fly. You know, the same day Etihad insisted I could not fly due to Australian government limits. When I cancelled the flight via Expedia, I was informed Etihad would be deducting a cancellation fee from the refund, even though it Etihad who cancelled my original flight and failed to provide me with a valid alternative! So now I have to pursue them for the cost of the cancellation fee. Etihad are a disgrace.

### "First and last time choosing Etihad"
It took me 2 months of dealing with Etihad before getting to a point of writing a negative review, as I never do that. Which means I had given them many chances to fix my experience, which only got worse. I was surprised to be dealing (for over 2 months) with phone & FB representatives who gave me false promises, attitude and zero help. From guaranteeing a certain rate for extra luggage (I called to check, as the price in unavailable prior to purchasing a ticket) to ending up paying almost twice that amount (after already paying a very exaggerated amount for my one-way ticket), to poor communication and having to check the status of my complaint every week or so (which was not handled, of course, until this day), and to book a specific seat, which after getting confirmation turned out to not be available (3 different seats- same issue). I was never offered compensation, even after asking for it, and only got embarrassing answers from different people, plus promises to get a call back from a supervisor - which never happened. That is the tip of the iceberg of my experience. First and last time choosing Etihad.

### "Keep up the good service"
Not Verified |  Pleasantly surprised that Etihad have kept up the standard during Covid. Flight was smooth, food options were good. Flight took off on time. Keep up the good service.

### "By far the worst experience"
Not Verified |  By far the worst experience I have ever had with an airline. I purchased seats for an extra $128 when I booked my flights. My return flight was changed to a day later than what I booked. All reserved seats were eliminated so I had no assigned seats. I tried to rebook the seats online but they wanted to charge me for the seats again. I called the help center and after 1:20 minutes on hold, the agent told me to purchase the seats again and then request a refund. I replied that wasn't an option and finally got the agent to reassign my seats without a charge. Fast forward a few weeks and there is another flight schedule change. All assigned seats are lost again. Online attempt to recover wants me to pay again. Another long call to customer service to get resolved. Now it is check in time. After check in I find the paid for seats have been lost and instead I am given poor seats in the rear of the plane. Two additional calls to customer service being told they cannot change my seats nor will they refund the money I paid for the seats but they can assign the correct seats for the return flights. Thirty minutes after the call I log back into their website to see if I can download my boarding passes. Surprise! The assigned seats for the return flights are now gone and I don't have any seat assigned.

### "become increasingly disappointing"
As a former Gold member of Etihad, the airline has become increasingly disappointing over the years. Flight booked on Etihad website from Cape Town to Dubai. Etihad cancels Cape Town leg, stating they no longer fly to Cape Town. Departure point is changed to Johannesburg, approx 1500km away. Etihad books a local flight on British Airways after numerous phone calls to an incompetent disinterested call centre. Flight cancelled again. This time Etihad refuses to re-book a local flight. I have to pay extra and book a separate flight to Johannesburg, or run the risk of losing my entire Etihad flight. Bus journey Abu Dhabi - Dubai is uneventful (once you find them in the open parking lot). There are no proper directions from arrival to the bus area. Once you arrive there you have to stand around waiting for the bus driver to arrive, no seating area as you're in the middle of a parking lot. Return bus journey to Abu Dhabi. There is no Etihad bus station, only a parking lot behind an old shopping centre. They state in their emails that you have to be there 2 hours before the time. Their call centre's response: that's just the way it is. Then you have to wait on the street (in the Dubai climate) for the bus. How can a company treat its loyal patrons with such contempt? Etihad can - they're just too big and too rich to care.

### "a bad experience at all levels"
Travelled from Chicago to Abu Dhabi. It was a bad experience at all levels. Or you can say way below what I expected. It was so expensive for economy class. Check in no real line they check whoever come to the counter. Boarding was the same. The flight attendants they were not organized. They go back and forth for each person to serve lunch. There was no food menu. No paper or electronic. So technically you don’t know what they serve. The seats were a torture. Old uncomfortable seats. This is my first and last experience and I don’t recommend Etihad to any traveller. On our way back we were denied boarding. They told me that We can not board because our Covid test it was 36 hours not 24 hour. Although we are fully vaccinated. They can just simply offer to test us again before the flight and wait in the plane till the result is back as there was a testing facility at the airport that give results in 2 hours and they didn’t even mention They are very cheap and heartless individuals.

### "I’m extremely disappointed"
Not Verified |  Etihad really went downhill. Big delays on all flights. But the worse was the attitude de of the staff: rude or, in the best case, ignoring. Asking for a glass of water makes them upset. Kids running and shouting, people not wearing face masks, attendant call button pressed in for 30 minutes - they choose to ignore it. When you say that you wait for 30 minutes to grasp their attention because you need water to take your medicine, they don’t apologize. They stare at you. I flew with Etihad in the past. Now I’m extremely disappointed.

### "Disaster, and never again!"
Appalling service on Etihad business class. Didn't bother reading reviews as it supposedly is such a well renowned airline I didn't see it as necessary, but boy were we wrong. Seats broken, maitre flirting with passenger for hours and showing pictures of her in bathing suit, absolutely unbelievable. On our return flight we had 7 kids running back and forth from economy to business for 5 continuous hours, and cabin crew did nothing. At the end the business class was full of trash on the floor. Out of 4 flights only one was decent in flight as it was during night, and minimal service is needed, but they forgot to do priority boarding for business class in Abu Dhabi. On all 4 flights no priority baggage service. Disaster, and never again!

### "below average experience"
Flight was 1+ hour late, missed the coach to Dubai. My food was mostly inedible. Seats average nothing special - entertainment average - air hostess with uninspiring service, they don’t seem to like their jobs and asking for additional water attracts hostile stares. Overall a below average experience.

### "This was the worst flight experience"
This was the worst flight experience I have ever had. The flight left 1.5 hrs late, resulting in me and many other passengers missing our connecting flights in Abu Dhabi. Despite knowing that a large number of people had close connections, Etihad did not hold any flights (although they had announced they would). I waited in a mob scene at the transfer desk for 10 hrs before finally being rebooked on a flight that was not leaving Abu Dhabi for another day-and-a-half. Etihad sent me to a hotel outside of the airport and assured me someone would pick me up the following day 3 hrs before my re-scheduled flight. The promised transport never came, and I ended up having to take a cab back to the airport. When I arrived 2 days late in Muscat, my luggage was missing. Turns out it had never left Abu Dhabi. It took Etihad another 3 days to get the luggage to Muscat, by which time I had moved on to my final destination of Salalah. Etihad refused to send the luggage to me in Salalah because they do not fly there (other airlines do, but throughout this fiasco they would not consider putting either me or my luggage on a different airline). I ended up having to get a friend to pick up the luggage in Muscat and bring it to me Salalah. Worst airline ever.

### "attentive, friendly and professional"
Flew on the 17 March on flight EY21 and sat in seat 6A. I was warmly greeted on entering the aircraft. The breakfast was the best I've had on a flight, absolutely fabulous. The staff who served me on this flight were Soraya the cabin manager and Rami who were wonderfully attentive, friendly and professional. A real credit to themselves and to the airline. I was overall very impressed by my outstanding experience on this flight. Highly recommended.

### "Denied to board my checked bag"
Not Verified |  Denied to board my checked bag, as they were not sure connecting airlines were able to take it. I offered to write and take full responsibility for it, but I still was denied. I paied extra kilos for my flight, demanded those to be refunded in full, and was denied as my "documents were not in order to reach final destination". This is a nonsense, in fact I was allowed on board myself because the documents were actually perfectly "in order". 2 months to get answer from their refund service and the answer is totally irrelevant to the case.

### "Customer service were rude and arrogant"
Not Verified |  Cancelled second leg of my trip mid flight. Stuck in Abu Dhabi for 24 hours. Customer service were rude and arrogant. Been trying to claim compensation for the last six weeks. Etihad make it almost impossible to claim any compensation by making their feedback website so difficult. Avoid this airline, when things go wrong they do not want to know.

### "Bad service over 4 flights"
Not Verified |  Bad service over 4 flights, arrogant and rude cabin crew that need re-training. Delays, Sub standard food. Have flown Etihad many times in the past, with no problems. I will never book with them again.

### "worst experience was my Inbound journey"
Not much issues with the Outbound travel, except the flight crew attitude. The worst experience was at my Inbound journey. Let me start from the beginning On my flight from Cochin to Abu Dhabi, I had to wait for almost 1.30 Hrs. to get OK to Board. As you aware on arrival UAE visa is available for all US Green card holders. However the ground staff keep staying they need an OK to board. At last they manage to resolve that issue and I paid $100 for my additional baggage for Cochin to Charlotte. Again the flight crew experience was not good. In my Inbound travel there was a stopover of 2 days at Abu Dhabi. Due to Covid issues , I called the call center and make sure the reporting time is 3 hours prior to departure. On 6th morning I reached the departure Terminal at 6.30 AM, There was a long queue and all flights check in was done through the same counter. That looks weird to me. Usually there is a separate counter for each flight. The line was not moving so fast, so I report to your ground staff that my flight is for US, I have to do multiple immigration. The response is to stay in line At 8.00AM they called me and sent to separate counter for check in. Again in that that counter I have to wait for 15 minutes to get my turn. Check in staff verified all papers and visa Docs, then they advise me to pay $100 again for additional baggage. I told them that I already paid that money at Cochin and showed the receipt. Check in staff escalated that issue to her supervisor (that took another 15 minutes). Supervisor insist me to pay another $100 for additional baggage. Due to shortage of time, I couldn’t argue with them and agreed to pay. She sent me to another counter where I handover my US Visa credit card. He can’t process the payment in that counter due to some access issues, so he sent me back to the check in counter again. That exercise went 3 times. At the end I have to exchange the dollars in wallet to settle the payment (lost almost $15 on money exchange). At last they released me from the check in counter 45 minutes before flight departure. Literally I had to run to complete the immigration formalities. Again the flight crew experience was not good from AUH to JFK At JFK I got an announcement from Etihad staff that I can collect the luggage only at my final destination I got only 1 check in baggage at charlotte out of 2, 2nd one I got on Saturday morning (Jan 8th).

### "not recommend flying with Etihad"
Not Verified |  Terrible. Second worst airline I've ever flown with and I cannot even send them feedback because their feedback form doesn't work (keeps taking me back to the first step when I press continue). You know an airline is not good when you cannot even provide them with your feedback (I've been trying for days now). The only thing that was good about my flight with Etihad was that the food was edible and some of it was actually quite nice (although 1 meal on a 7 hour flight is stingy, especially when you see the cabin crew chowing down on leftover business class food). A few of the ground staff were very nice and the chairs are comfortable (the only major plus) but otherwise I would not recommend flying with Etihad at all.

### "seat configuration 3-3-3 is really penalizing"
Four legs with B787-9. Aircrafts clean, average inflight service and food. Check in in Malpensa of more than an hour. The Boeing 787 is quite silent, but the seat configuration 3-3-3 is really penalizing. Hard seats, after some hours of flight they are unbearable, difficult to sleep. Pitch of 31" about, too limited for long flights. Except the seats, I believe they did not bad, for me better than the last reports in this website.

### "no full-recline seats in Business Class"
Shocking that in 2022, Etihad would put us up in such an aircraft. Absolutely dated like from the 80s, no full-recline seats in Business Class. No cheese options with wine. Dessert with the western meal for Business at night was fruit salad. Must say, the hostess was exceptional. She even took down a complaint about the above, & said someone would call me, but no one bothered to.

### "ground services were appalling"
Not Verified |  Whilst going to and returning from Sydney the in flight experience was very good, the ground services were appalling. At Heathrow check in took over 45 minutes. At Sydney although bags were marked priority we and other business class passengers were the last to be able to retrieve our luggage. On the return flight the business lounge at Abu Dhabi was overcrowded and difficult to find a seat On arrival at Heathrow baggage reclaim was similar to Sydney with our luggage and that of other business class passenger being the last to be retrieved having eventually being found on another carousel. I sent an email complaining which had to be followed after a week later to elicit a reply. Eventually I received a reply saying that they were noting my observations This was followed almost immediately with another email saying complaint resolved. If flying business class I expect the whole flying experience to be good. This was definitely not so with Etihad and will make me wary next time.

### "I will never fly Etihad again"
I will comment about the attitude of the cabin crew on the Abu-Dhabi to Barcelona leg of my journey. I got the impression that the passengers were treated more of as an annoyance than paying customers by most members of the cabin crew. Also for a a long-haul journey, it seems not acceptable that not once were we offered a refill for our juice / coffee. And on entering and exiting the airplane, no greetings from the cabin crew. I will never fly Etihad again.

### "Definitely will not book with them again"
Not Verified |  Flew economy class recently to Thailand. All 4 flights I don’t have anything at all good to say. Seats including seat space are shocking. Cabin crew service not great at all, crew need a lesson on how to actually deliver proper service including a drinks and snack service, before handing out food that you don’t really have a clue what is in this food. Snacks were a rubbish tasteless Bombay type mix nothing else on offer. Food dry and tasteless. Cabin crew some were nice some just thought they were a cut above their passengers. Nothing good at all to say about the service full stop. Definitely will not book with them again.

### "the worst service I received"
This is regarding my booking in Etihad Airways. I request the refund on 27-Dec-2021 due to the Covid conditions in one of my family members. I waited 2 weeks and then called Etihad about the status and I was told that it was processed on 29-Dec. I wanted another 2 weeks and asked again on 29-Jan-2022 and was told it was not processed. I escalated the issue and someone called me and confirmed that he is processing on the same day. I called again on 05-Feb-22 and was told it has processed on 04-Feb-2022. Each time I was asked to wait another 45 days. Due to this confusion, I am not sure if the request has been processed or not? and are all the agents lying? It has been 45 days and how long I can wait? This is the worst service I received.

### "From best airline to worst airline"
From best airline to worst airline. Can’t change booking online, and the call center number does not work 9 times out of 10. Was charged a no show penalty of around 500$. Thing is, how to change your ticket when you can’t do it online and their call center number does not work? They also cancelled flights once with few days notice. As suggested by friends, I’ll book Emirates moving forward and fly from Dubai instead.

### "it was totally disrespectful"
The experience in the flight EY42 Dublin to Abu Dhabi was really nice but the staff in Ey246 Abu Dhabi to Kochi was not friendly. I was suffering from severe headache and when I asked the cabin crew for a Panadol and a glass of water she told me straight away that she is not able to provide as she have many other jobs to do. I don’t know apart from serving the clients on board, what else is more important for her - it was totally disrespectful. I’m so sorry to write a review that it was totally a worst experience.

### "Really disappointed with the service"
Extremely disappointing with the service from Etihad! I booked flights in economy with 23kg luggage included. The flight home i changed to a few weeks later and selected the value option what showed me to have included 30kg of luggage after i booked the new flight it only showed that i got 23kg off luggage included. I rang multiple time the customer hotline and ask why i didn’t get the 30kg what it showed when i changed the booking.. the lady on the phone pretty much said i should had done a screenshot because without it she cant do nothing about it. Really disappointed with the service provided!

### "Bought wifi which didn’t work"
Worst airline and facilities based on the comparative fares. I travelled from Toronto to Jeddah and back in business class. Both ways faced issues with the electronic system, TV, wifi and charger. Bought wifi which didn’t work and on complaining to the customer service on return got a pathetic response while admitting that issues i reported were correct. Business class lounge at Abu Dhabi is extremely crowded with minimum facilities, same at Toronto. Do not recommend.

### "they reduced my baggage allowance"
When I tried to book a economy choice ticket to London from Chennai using student code in Etihad website, the checked baggage allowance showed was 45kg. After booking the ticket they changed it to 40kg allowance. When I called their customer service regarding this issue, this is what I was told: Baggage allowance has been reduced to 40kg because I booked the ticket using student code. I still cannot see a word showing checked baggage allowance will be reduced to 40kg if I use the code. The terms and conditions only shows (If the selected fare for your journey already includes a checked baggage allowance of 40kg or more in Economy or 50kg or more in Business, no further additional baggage allowance will apply when using the promo code STU10.). Clearly it says it no further will added and not reduced. But they reduced my baggage allowance. Also, their customer care takes hours to answer calls. Never going to choose Etihad in future. Etihad just lost a customer who would have become their regular.

### "don't book quarantine packages"
The worst experience. I applied for quarantine packages to Etihad holiday and waited for four days, they didn't respond and then I made a call, they told me that I can book any hotel that I'd affiliated with Saudi embassy. I booked the hotel but when we arrived at the airport they said we don't accept this hotel. Many times they misguided me. I suggest you that don't book quarantine packages for this worst flight.

### "cancelled my flight with 5 hours notice"
Etihad cancelled my flight with 5 hours notice and were unable to get me on another for 3 days. I understand and accept that flights occasionally need to be cancelled but there were two major issues with Etihad in this instance. Their communication email was gibberish and misleading. It said, at the same time, that the flight was cancelled and then below it confirmed it was going. At  no time did Etihad offer to help with any accommodation, transportation, subsistence or anything. When I asked about recompense for my costs (including having to pay for another Covid test because the one I had would be beyond the 48 hour limit) I was informed that it is not Etihad's responsibility.

### "we are still waiting for the refund"
After booking our honeymoon flight to Maldives with stopover in Abu Dhabi with Etihad Airways they cancelled our flight and automatically rebooked us to a different one. The new flight times were not suitable to us so we cancelled the booking and asked for refund. We provided them with all necessary information that they demanded which was in August this year (2021). One of their employees (service coordinators) confirmed the initiation of the refund beginning of September with the comment it can take up to 45 work days for the transfer to be credited to our bank account. After waiting now for several months and a couple of additional calls to ask for the status we are still waiting for the refund!

### "the worst experience"
It was the worst experience of my life. The counter staff at the airport was very unprofessional and rude, with no idea how to deal with customers. They must have to provide very good customer service training before making them sit on counters. First impression is the last. I would not recommend anyone to fly with Etihad.

### "basically stolen money from me"
Etihad Airways have basically stolen money from me by not returning money that I paid into their Travel Bank. They have advised me that even though I paid £1000 into the travel bank, even knowing that I won't use them, they will not refund me. Disgusting company, think twice before booking them.

### "do not care one bit about you"
Not Verified | In July 2019 I booked my flights with Etihad Airways via their online website...very good prices ($6,500 for 4 adults). We were suppose to travel from New Zealand to UK in March 2020 but Covid hit us and Etihad cancelled the flights. They initially said we could get a credit note but then offered a full refund but I had to wait 12 months after the original departure date. In April 2021 I submitted my refund request which was accepted and they said they had made the refund to my bank account. After a few months I hadn't received my refund so I started sending emails out via their website and messenger. They took ages to respond and it seemed they just wanted to appease you, hoping you would go away. In September 2021, after numerous emails they sent me a screen shot of the bank account they sent the refund to, but it wasn't mine. I sent more emails, then in November 2021 they said they had sent my refund to the wrong bank account and won't reissue the refund until they get the money back from who ever they sent it too. Now in December 2021, over 2 years later and still no refund and now they have stopped replying to my emails. Whatever you do, don't make the same mistake I did. Yes, they may be a little cheaper but there's a reason why, if something goes wrong you will be left high and dry and Etihad do not care one bit about you.

### "improved their Economy product"
This was my 5th time flying onboard of Etihad Airways within the past few years. While my previous trip is 2 years ago, I feel like Etihad has improved their Economy product recently. I flew from Munich to Abu Dhabi in the Etihad Boeing 787-9 Economy Class. Even though I am 6ft3' tall, I had enough legroom for the 6 hour flight. The cabin crew were very kind and they had trained staff that were able to give you all the necessary Covid-related information about the flight, destination and so on. Before the departure, the crew handed out a Wellness kit with a face mask and hand sanitisers. I felt the cabin was very clean, crew also paid a lot of attention that covid guidelines were followed. The seat had a big touch screen with a remote and had hundreds of movies, tv series, live tv, music and even games! They also offered inflight WI-FI, which I didn't try though. 1,5 hrs after departure, the Crew handed out the meal which was delicious and the best meal I had in  Economy Class. The cabin crew passed around to hand out beverages and had a big offering from alcoholic drinks, to soft drinks etc. Pleasantly surprised from Etihad. Will choose again for sure!

### "seat choices is also very expensive"
They will allow you very limited baggage allowance, if you need to buy more KGs it is unbelievably very very expensive, The seat choices is also very expensive e.g. exit seat more than 100 USD per passenger per leg So if you are family of 5 with 2 legs in one trip you need to pay around 1000 USD for such seat selection!

### "Flight attendants were very good and attentive"
Started at Washington Dulles. Before going to the airport spent a half hour getting the files uploaded for Verified to Fly program. Got the email saying it was inputted. Got to airport and was told that it was not reviewed and that I had to go to the check-in but not verified line. I feel that was a waste of a half hour because they had to go over all of the same information I had inputted in the line before I got to the counter and then again at the counter. That is a lot of saying and showing the same thing. Boarding was average. Efficient. Flight left early. Flight attendants were very good and attentive. Inflight entertainment was excellent and the in seat power and communications was very good. Comfortable 12hr flight. The food was average for airplane food on an international flight I liked the mid flight sandwich the best. In Abu Dhabi the first class lounge was very nice with showers and food and drinks. The second leg of the flight went well. A bit tighter on the smaller plane but still nice service. Arrival in Male was uneventful. The return trip I did not even try to do the verified to travel and I feel that was probably a good save of my time. The boarding was a bit confusing getting on the bus but the flight left early and was very nice. I left my phone on the plane in Abu Dhabi and it was completely my fault. I realized it on the bus on the way to the terminal. As soon as I arrived at the terminal I went to the transfer desk and asked them to see if they could have someone get it from the plane. The agent was very nice and called 3 different people to try to help and he was told that no one could help and the only thing to do was fill out an online form to report it. This was 10 minutes after I walked off the plane. I was on the first bus. The cleaners were probably not even on the plane yet. I have worked for 4 different airlines and I design airports. I am well aware of exactly how much effort it takes to retrieve something off of an aircraft. Every airline is expected to get me from point A to point B safely. Most airlines will try to do it with some comfort. If you are going to try to be one of the best it is your customer service that has to stand out and this is point where Etihad failed. This cannot be the first time someone has left something on a plane. Since it had only been minutes there should have been a way to quickly retrieve it. Since I was only transiting and I had a 9 hour layover there was no reason to not be able to get it to me. There was no customs to go through since I was transiting only normal security. There should be an agent that could walk on the plane and retrieve an item quickly and but it in their normal system for lost and found. If it had been 2 hours since I had landed before reporting it the plane would have been cleaned and reset for the next destination and the item was either found or not and then the form is the best answer. 10 min is very different. The AUH hotel in the in transit is very nice and worth the cost. The final leg went well getting back home.

### "Etihad has been the worst airline"
Etihad has been the worst airline I have ever dealt with in my life. At the beginning of 2020, I purchased 2 business class return tickets that were then cancelled due to the Pandemic. After calling and trying to tirelessly get through to them, their best offer was to transfer credits into my "travel credit bank" to be used in the future. After using the travel credits, they told me that I was only able to get one single ticket (I originally paid for two). I was disheartened by this but understood the circumstances and agreed to it. When my flight was rebooked, the airline continuously cancelled the flight without letting me know that the flight was cancelled. I then had to make a very expensive international call to get in touch with them, where they told me that the flight has been cancelled yet again and they will get in touch with me when I was able to fly again. This never happened, I was never told that the flights had resumes (not even by email) which is when I had to once again make an expensive phone call to find out. Now attempting to rebook my flight (bear in mind I no longer needed to travel to my destination as I was attending an event that had already passed as the flights were cancelled). I made another international call where the operator was completely lost and unhelpful. She told me that I was able to stop over at Abu Dhabi and then 20 minutes later changed her mind, she was completely unaware of the system and the way the airline works and kept me on hold for a long time (again bear in mind this was an expensive international call). They asked me for additional fees any way I wanted to book my flight. I did not even need to go anywhere I just wanted to use up these credits as it was quite a bit of money. I was then fed up with this unreasonable system and asked for a full cash refund, the operator then told me that this was not possible because I was using my airline credits, the only reason I was using these credits in the first place was that they did not allow me to apply for a refund initially. She then explained that the policy has changed (again they did not make us aware of this at all). I had to tirelessly fight her to open a case with her superiors as I have been patient enough with them however with the flight cancellations they are now holding my money against me.

### "out of pocket for 2 years"
Not Verified |  Disadvantaged as an Australian Prior to the COVID outbreak we had booked flights to Italy and unfortunately due to the travel ban had to postpone our flight. When we contacted Etihad they encouraged us to postpone the trip rather than cancel, using what they call 'travel bank'. At the time we were told that the travel bank was valid for a period of 2 years depending on the circumstances surrounding COVID. With the Australian government putting a travel ban on Australians since March 2020 with no information around when the borders will reopen, we have been unable to make any plans to try and arrange our travel. A few weeks back we decided to call Etihad to get information on our options, as the 2 years in which the travel bank has been valid we have not been able to make use of the credit. Etihad has communicated that regardless of the Australian travel ban that the period the travel bank is valid is still for 2 years. What I don't understand is how can I have a credit that is ticking over when I did not have the opportunity to make use of it? What is also disappointing is that we have since been informed that if an airline cancels a flight that all passengers will be reimbursed in full. The flight we had booked was cancelled due to COVID. So if we had not done the right thing and contacted Etihad for their advice we more thank likely would not be in this position and out of pocket for 2 years.

### "Worst customer service"
Worst customer service I have ever seen. The UAE government lifted restrictions on travel on August 5th from Pakistan but they still cancelled my ticket for August 8th. The customer service was providing wrong information and did not want to help me. They were offering an alternate ticket a month later which was not acceptable for us because of schools and job. I requested them to connect me to supervisor and they denied my request saying they are not available. At one point they stopped picking my phone. I had to let go and book a return flight with another airline.

### "disappointment with ground staff"
Not Verified |  I am writing this with full of disappointment. I had a wonderful vacation but the ending was poor and Etihad service was the only reason. I had paid extra for front seat and later i got an email for BID approved for upgrade. My bank account was having limits per day and it rejected the amount and the email had an option to update new bank card details. I tried to update the details and it was not getting clicked for the update of Bank Card. Inefficient website and not able to click the button and move forward. I contacted your call center and the lady was very helpful and she had to off load my seats and requested me to contact back for the upgrade amount information. The next lady was straight forward and wont help with regards to the BID part and have me the rates. I went to website again since i already paid 69 omr per seat to check in and confirm but the seats where costing again 69 omr. Call center had no clarity in communication and my seats where lost. I thought its better to reach the Airport JFK early so that i can pay for the upgrade. I waited till the queue was open by 5:35 pm. Staff and a lady Supervisor, was informed about my problem and said we cant do anything so wait in the queue. No clear communication. I was the first and went to the staff in the counter for 45 minutes to check in. She said system problem, covid protocol issue and etc etc. in fact for each matter she was consulting her colleague sitting next to her who had taken almost 6 customers and i am still without any answer. She kept telling me system issue. I went to supervisor and said i am looking for upgrade and ready to pay. The lady supervisor thankfully listened and entered the counter and asked the staff to move. Inefficient staff and not knowing what and how to use the system. Doesn't even know how to enter the Etihad Guest No. The lady supervisor sat and looked into the system and saw i had paid for front seats. And told me she can give me 2 upgrades and third incase there is seat she will let me know at counter. Remember i am ready to pay as i was aware there were seats in Business class and my upgrade did go through due to my bank card limitations. The staff was not explaining anything and the supervisor was allowing only 2 seats. I was at the gate and the ground staff was informed about the supervisor information about available seat upgrade and they were rude especially the same staff who was checking me and another old staff by ignoring and rejecting to talk. I send my wife and daughter but they gave 2 Free upgrades to other passengers and i was denied and made to sit in economy class. The crew was helpless. I was away from my family even when i was ready to pay and they have free upgrades to people who was there friends as i saw them very close at checking counte. I was asking the staff at JFK to make sure we get the close seats from Abu Dhabi to Muscat. Even though the flight was empty. She made it in two different places. The staff was not knowing how to check in and had all the confusions and kept on asking how to Tag the bags. Each entry in the system was done in discussion with others. Inefficiency at best. Total disappointment with ground staff.

### "they just sent me a refund request"
It's been more than 20 days since I transferred money to their account, but they just send me a refund request instead of a confirmation of a flight without explaining anything. The flights included a third party airline, so they couldn't confirm, but they still hold my money and haven't done anything after I called almost 17 times spending more than 15 hours. They have a customer support center, but I felt only some of customer support representatives try to help me, but the most of them are not worth being there since they are just like parrots repeats same words and phrases again and again without thinking anything.

### "refund request instead of a confirmation"
I can never recommend Etihad airline now. As other customers already mentioned, they lost credibilities and totally changed as they used to be before. I've booked a ticket and paid through a bank transfer within 24 hours following their instructions. I've waited for confirmation for almost a week, but I haven't heard anything from them. I've emailed them, asked them to check the status of payment and send me confirmation. But they sent me an email saying "in regard to your refund request," which I've never requested. They even didn't explain the status of my booking and why it was refund request instead of a confirmation. They don't answer our calls soon, and sometimes we have to hold for almost one hour or average about over 30 minutes. If you are lucky, you can catch a representative after holding for 7 minutes. But if any problem occurs to you, you would be suffered and frutrated for sure because they never call you back and you have to keep calling many times. After reaching a representative, they explained the reason of refund request. It was because a connected airline (their group airline) hasn't confirmed a part of my route, which should have been explained on an email before sending me a refund request. They were reluctant to do anything for me and didn't give me any alternatives saying "Your ticket has not been issued, and we are not able to do anything for you" even though I followed their instructions and sent them payment within their required time frame. They have not treated me as a customer since the ticket has not been issued, but they keep holding my money. The refund would take 7 to 40 days to credit to your account. I asked the representatives to let me talk to a manager, but they were still reluctant to let me get through to a manager saying "Managers would say the same things. I could talk to their supervisor in the end, but he or she also would not treat you as a customer unless your ticket has officially issued.

### "Unbelievably disappointing service"
Not Verified |  Unbelievably disappointing service with this airline. Decided to try them, instead of the usual Emirates flight I book. They offered free transfers to the airport which made me consider them. Booking system didn't work, advised to call them up. Called three times with 1.5hr wait times on each call. Went round in circles between different departments with the final Chauffeur booking team only accessible by email, who would reply they cant do it and need to call the airline. So disappointing compared to the other competition in the region (Emirates). I will not fly with this airline again and would not suggest anyone fly with Etihad. Even if you are in Abu Dhabi, it would be worth travelling to Dubai to fly with an established airline.

### "airline credit had expired already"
I needed to cancel my flight from Zürich to Sydney via Abu Dhabi because  Australia has been completely locked down and hardly lets anybody in and out of the country. Expedia sent me a message saying that I could use my airline credit within 12 months at the very least, if not longer, because of the pandemic. A couple of weeks ago I wanted to check the status of my airline credit. It had expired already. As opposed to Expedia, Etihad Airways decided to give me 6 months to use that credit during a time when hardly anybody can fly anywhere, much less to Australia. I wrote to Ethiad Airways directly but there are only chat robots who send you in circles, so I never heard from customer service.

### "claims of invalid visa"
Extreme dissatisfied service and support during and post flight. Booked flight from US to UAE from Charlotte to Abu Dhabi via Chicago. Everything seemed good and fine to officials at Charlotte to continue with the itinerary. Things changed drastically on arriving at Chicago airport. The officials would not let me board the flight citing some false claims of invalid visa when this was not the actual case. These officials were rude and would not listen to a word I had to say. They perceived their notion to be true and barred me from entering the flight to Abu Dhabi. All Etihad counters were closed at the airport and the customer support agents were of no help. No agent had the right info and upon confirming with the UAE government, it was proven to me that the agents as well as staff of Etihad did not have the correct info regarding anything. Due to this mishap, I had incurred more charges to take new PCR tests, book hotels and another flight out. These were not simple things and were not hassle free. Post flight, I am on continuous calls with the service agents and I have now seen that they closed this case without actually finding a proper resolution.

### "Miles do not help right now as unable to travel"
Our flight was cancelled due to Covid (April 2020) and therefore were unable to travel. When requesting a refund we were told all that we could get was a travel card and given miles to travel at a later date. But due to challenges with still being unable to fly and financial situation we have asked for a refund of the R17k but am informed that they are unable to provide a refund as we selected the travel card option. We were not given a choice otherwise we would have lost the money altogether. So just another one of those airlines that refuses to refund and stealing what we paid in good confidence. Miles do not help right now as unable to travel and does not look like can travel any time soon.

### "Overall good service"
Not Verified |  Abu Dhabi to Dublin, Business. Overall a smooth experience - had an issue with on line check in - so did so at the airport and a professional and friendly lady assisted. The lounge was offering food but in covid times and offerings I passed. On board crew were functional / professional and checked in on throughout the flight Food was fine - breakfast and drinks served when needed. Overall good service - nothing outstanding - but I understand that in Covid times the crew are their to ensure guest safety which they did.

### "worst flight I’ve ever taken"
Seating as expected in business on a new aircraft - nothing remarkable. Same with food. Cabin service non existent except for the two meals - on one’s own for anything else, in the galley, help yourself to packaged sandwich and candy bars. My main complaint relates to COVID precautions. All passengers required to wear a mask at all times, except when eating. In front of me was a 92-year old medical patient who needed periodic oxygen, coughed almost constantly during the flight, and had a doctor’s waiver so not required to wear a mask. He was accompanied by three caregivers who were in the aisle next to me constantly also not wearing masks. The cabin crew gave all attention to this traveling party, I felt as if I didn’t exist. The worst flight I’ve ever taken. Never Etihad again - Emirates or Qatar in the future.

### "said the broken stroller was normal wear and tear"
I've been waiting for a refund since September 2020. Each call I make gives me promise of refund within 1 to 15 days. 2021 - Broke my child's stroller, left us helpless at the airport. Filled out a form, gave them a receipt, and they said the broken stroller was normal wear and tear. Horrible attitude behind fake smiles, and the outsourced nameless staff keep transferring responsibilities until the customer gives up. Please don't use them if you have a choice.

### "worst airline I have ever travelled"
Horrendous airline, avoid at all cost. I have been stranded in Pakistan for the past 4 months because of this airline. They have cancelled our flight 4 times and every time they do it the last minute. We were supposed to fly on the 16th of June and now they are telling us that the next available flight is on 16th of July. We asked for a refund and they refused to give it. We are already out of money due to being stranded here and they are taking advantage of that. This airline has been the worst airline I have ever travelled on. Wont ever be booking with them again and I suggest you do the same. Absolutely pathetic.

### "the lack of customer service"
I booked a flight from Jeddah to Washington DC via Abu Dhabi, with my 9-old son and my other 14-year-old son on Aug 06th, 2019. The first leg was from JED to AUH. This flight was delayed which was the first of many problems in this fiasco. In Abu Dhabi, indirect flight through Rome was booked without my consent and without asking me. Boarding passes were printed and placed on a bench with many other boarding passes. Communication with the employees was not very pleasant and stiff. There was around a 12-hour transit that I had to endure with my two kids in an arranged hotel by Etihad. The room had only two single beds, we were three passengers. When I asked for an extra bed, they said I had to pay. I wasn’t able to complete my American immigration process because the flight that was arranged for me without my consent was not direct. This defeated the whole purpose of my original plan; I chose this flight via AUH to finish part of my immigration in AUH. I was assigned different seats then what I had initially paid extra for, in all my flights. I paid 126 USD. I arrived at IAD after a long exhausting trip with my kids and was shocked to find my luggage damaged. I went to the office at IAD, they told me they can’t do anything and that I have to make a claim online. With all the delays included we finally arrived at our destination over 24 hours later than anticipated. I had incurred losses over $1326 USD in additional costs between expensive airport meals, and much needed supplies. These costs add up, but what really is more aching is the way that we felt like handled. The employees, rather than helping, were simply passing us along without the help that we needed. It was a series of problems, one on top of another. Not just a single failure to perform, which can be understood. We understand that mistakes happen, computer failures occur and things can’t always run as smoothly as planned. However, we don’t understand the lack of customer service that we received. We felt disregarded and unvalued. We realize many customers experienced delays and similar problems, but we still felt like things could have been handled better.

### "they came and consoled me"
I was travelling from Chicago to Bangalore due to family emergency, the moment I boarded the flight I got to know my father had left this world. I was sad and crying but the cabin crew Nora and her colleague florentina the moment thy got the know they came and consoled me and they checked on me throughout the flight. They made sure I eat something and I sleep and stay hydrated it was a journey which had so much pain that I felt I won’t be able to make it. Nora made sure she gets me wifi access so that I can stay in contact with my family along with that she also made sure once I reach Abu Dhabi I have a good rest. All of them came as angels and helped me reach safely and without the help I could not had gathered strength to console my family

### "rescheduled with more than 24 hrs of layover"
My parents tickets was initially scheduled for 19th April from Trivandrum to Washington DC with a 3 hr layover in AUH and was rescheduled by the airline itself later and notified us via email that our flight got rescheduled with more than 24 hrs of layover in AUH! We haven’t notified anything regarding their hotel arrangements made me suspicious and I called the customer service with around 50 mins of wait time to talk to an agent! And customer service rep then informed us that they will not provide food or accommodation even though it’s rescheduled by the airline itself with more than 24 hrs of layover. I have made 5 phone calls to Etihad customer service for multiple queries regarding the same booking with a wait time of 1hr or more each time to talk to an agent ( which is ok) but the fun part begins here.

### "refused to refund extra 100 plus dollars"
I travelled on Etihad in the start of April 2021. I'm extremely dissatisfied with the service. I planned to have a extra bag when I was coming back home to USA. When I tried to Check in online three times using different credit cards but No success. The system was asking for a Code that I never received. I called my credit card Capital one to inquire and they have no record of Etihad trying to buy the extra bag online. So Etihad Airways never communicated with my credit card companies. My payment was not processed by Etihad. I was not able to check in online. The fee for one extra bag was $157.00  There was no information about the extra payment on the airport. There was no information on the website about extra payment at the airport. This information was not shared with me on any email either. Not knowing that I would pay extra at the airport. I went to airport and when I checked in my extra bag, it costs me $274, which was almost double the price $157. I was not informed at the website that I would be paying extra at the airport. Etihad refused to refund extra 100 plus dollars

### "my luggage came out 25 kg"
It was my first time flying with Etihad, I was traveling alone for first time in my life. They have me such a hard time at airport for luggage weight. The limit is 23 kg each bag and mine at home were like a kg or two above 23 and I was thinking its ok. On counter they asked me for extra money as my luggage came out 25 kg, I never paid extra for few kgs weight with Emirates so it was quite shocking for me. I have to pay 110$ at Etihad counter. I will never fly with them again. In Plane for some reason I requested to change my seat and one of attendants was so rude and told me that there is a law that you cannot change your seat and you have to sit where you are.

### "Etihad what has gone so wrong with you?"
Not Verified |  Gold member - General feedback on their website and reservations. Tried 6 hours to reserve a seat on their website and it crashed and off line - Called the gold line - 6 times - 3 times disconnected- other 3 hours taking to agents who did their very best to help but due to their internal processes, could get no where. The “supervisors“ at all times not available dealing with other guests .. clearly numerous complaints. Appears Even in Covid they want to pack an aircraft to the fullest with no spacing. One only asked for exit row and would pay to have a seat free ? Impossible. After 4 hours wasted on calls and further time on their non functioning website I just gave up and cancelled the flight. Emirates booked me in minutes and had a spaced seating plan in place. Etihad what has gone so wrong with you? I actually felt sorry for the call agents as they were nothing but apologetic and did their very best, zero leadership to support them.

### "I would recommend Etihad"
Not Verified |  My 8th time flying Etihad and they have kept their exceptional standard throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. There were hygiene practices in place and transferring at Abu Dhabi International was flawless and efficient. Onboard their 787-9 I found the seats to be firm but comfortable and the IFE system to have a large selection of movies. The on board meal and snacks were very tasty and the portion sizes were enough. I would recommend Etihad.

### "No one has got back to me"
At Etihad Check-In at Sydney airport I was told I need to apply for an "Exemption to Travel" from Australian Immigration. Inform them that's not the case. I've checked the government site and it says if I'm "ordinarily resident in another country" I don't need to apply for an exemption. Clerk refuses to accept that. Insists, rudely, that I carry my four heavy bags across the terminal to be interviewed by Australian Border Force staff for an Exemption. Get the Exemption - that I didn't need. Board the plane. I'm a Platinum Frequent Flyer. Not recognised. Not even a "Welcome on board". During the flight ask for my Complimentary WiFi. No-one knows anything about it. Flight Director has no vouchers. Served cold scrambled eggs and a cold cappuccino. There are 4 people in Business, 10 in Economy. I've paid an extra €810 to be upgraded to Business on this leg. Once home., few days later notice, once again, they haven't credited me the miles for the SYD-ABU DHABI leg. Write to them. They add the missing miles. I get a lousy 750 miles extra for upgrading to Business. I've sent three emails complaining about my treatment at Sydney, cold food onboard, no wifi, missing miles. No one has got back to me. They don't care. No wonder they are losing money hand over fist if this is they way they treat their Platinum guests. Had enough. Changing airlines.

### "I wasn't allowed to board"
I was supposed to travel with Etihad on 11 Dec 2020 from Toronto to Mumbai via Abu Dhabi. My flight was rescheduled and also on the day of boarding I wasn't allowed to board the flight stating that I am Indian citizen. Etihad didn't even feel responsible to inform the flyer beforehand whether they can board on the flight or not. And also i had confirmed with the Airline call center, who told, I can board the flight. I had booked hotel at the Aerotel Transit, for one day, plus my Covid test also became void they next day after flight. Also Etihad's Airport staff is very disrespectful, working as if they are not paid properly or made to over work. They pulled me out of the line and said we are not responsible for mismanagement of Airlines booking fault. Made me call the reservation to cancel ticket at the last moment. Because of them I had to pay extra $1000 to cover up their mistake to buy another ticket with another airline.

### "Etihad has been consistently appalling"
I am an Australian citizen who is desperately trying to return home from the UK. I flew with Etihad last year into London and found them pleasurable but it appears that a company's true character is revealed when the chips fall. Indeed, during this COVID pandemic, Etihad has been consistently appalling. There are a number of Facebook groups for Australians who are currently stranded overseas and it is agreed upon that Etihad is the worst airline to secure seats back. They are constantly overbooking economy and business class passengers so that the only way to be confirmed to fly with them is via first class seats. They are fully aware of the Arrival Caps in Australia and yet they continue to provide false hope to thousands of Australians only to later cancel their flights at a moment's notice (my most recent cancellation was yesterday, 8 days from my travel date, after I had already made arrangements to leave and pack up my entire life here). Their customer service is equally appalling. I was openly bawling on the phone when they said that their next available flight was TWO MONTHS LATER. They provided zero comfort, zero assurance I would make this flight, zero information about how many people had already booked so I could ascertain the likelihood of my being bumped for a third time. I realise their customer support staff are not counsellors but surely they are not robots. I will never book with them again.

### "I could only have a credit applied"
Myself and my partners flight was cancelled 12 days before our scheduled departure without notice. The only way I found out was by refreshing the itinerary in the app daily, when it just disappeared one day! We had quit our jobs and moved out of our apartments relying on this "Confirmed" flight with Etihad to fly from NYC to Sydney on December 3. When I called Etihad to see when the next available flight would be or to see if I would be refunded, the employee told me that I could only have a credit applied to my account for the cost of the flight to use on Etihad exclusively within 12 months. Seeing as we needed to get home for Christmas and that they have no available flights for the next 3 months this "travel credit" is seemingly useless (and they know this).

### "obvious and effective COVID-Safe practices in place"
Not Verified |  Despite many airlines flailing around and scrambling to cut costs throughout 2020's COVID pandemic, Etihad still maintains the top-spot on my personal airline tier list. Boarding and disembarking was flawless with obvious and effective COVID-Safe practices in place. Throughout the flight all passengers (regardless of seating class) were looked after by friendly, polite and professional cabin staff. Another excellent flight on Etihad.

### "no physical distancing from Abu Dhabi to Karachi"
Not Verified |  Great physical distancing and socially responsible on Toronto to Abu Dhabi. Unfortunately, no physical distancing from Abu Dhabi to Karachi. How deplorable for such a big airline to act so irresponsibly. Emirates was only 200 hundred dollars more, however I had to buy ticket in emergency and couldn't wait for Emirates date to fly due to emergency in the family.

### "COVID safety clearly in place"
Business Class outbound August and returning September Abu Dhabi Airport was very quiet, in so sailed through check In and Security . Lounge food was order only and served in plastic but considering the Covid - it is what it is. Both flights were exceptional COVID safety clearly in place with Staff enforcing masks and requirements. Both flights quiet, so staff offered attentive service at all times - food was good yet menu had less options but similar to Non Covid times. I am Gold with Etihad and have been flying them since they began operations - One has witnessed the good and bad times but this flights team were top marks. A special call out to the male cabin crew member on my return who could not be more professional. Top marks - in these challenging times - Its great to see high morale on service. I for one remain loyal to Etihad - like all services there have been slips but they try hard.

### "I hope to fly with you again soon"
Etihad They offer good services for a very reasonable price and is my favourite airline! Unfortunately, due to Covid, I had to cancel my flight which was booked for July. I understand that this pandemic is incredibly difficult for airlines, and even though I had to wait a little while, everything was solved very well. Thank you, Etihad and I hope to fly with you again soon!

### "I never did get the refund"
Not Verified |  This is concerning the refunds which were promised after the flight to Colombo was cancelled. Due to Covid-19, we were not able to embark on our flight to Dusseldorf, as it was cancelled. We had expected this, and therefore it did not come as a surprise. In order to get my tickets refunded, I called Etihad in the third week of July, and they promised me the full flight would be refunded within 40 days. I was very pleased with the quality and kindness of the helpdesk. However, I never did get the refund that I was promised, and when I tried to call Etihad from the Netherlands, I couldn't get anyone on the phone. Chatting on Facebook and sending an e-mail also did not work. I really would like to get the refund, as it was paid from my own pocket and I am studying currently. Hence, even though the customer service was well set up when I called in July, I haven't been able to contact Etihad since, and I have not been contacted by them either to inform me about the refund.

### "got a free cushion and amenities"
Comfy seats with legrest. I got a free cushion and amenities which was nice. Not much food options though. The crew were welcoming and enthusiastic in serving the customers.

### "A nice first class service"
When I entered the plane a nice welcome was done by the cabin crew who gave me a champagne with Arabic dates. They prepared the bed on my first class suite. Sleep was ok. The next morning the crew served me breakfast with lot's of options to eat. About 2 hours before landing in Paris the crew asked whether I needed a shower and I said yes. The plane had a shower area. I showered and after landing the crew greeted me goodbye. A nice first class service that I recommend to others.

### "The worst customer service"
Moscow to Abu Dhabi flight on 23 September was canceled. I was calling to call center on 20th  and 21st of September. The worst service I faced from all airlines i used to fly before. The girl who answered call on 21/09 was rude, and provide me wrong information. If in my hand, I will get refund and never buy tickets from Etihad. The worst customer service. Will not recommend

### "response continues to be subpar"
While I can appreciate the impact that COVID-19 has had on the airline industry, for a supposed quality airline their response continues to be subpar. Not only was the experience of flight cancellation by Etihad at a foreign airport quite awful; customer service was equally unhelpful. I was told a refund would take up to two months yet here I am having not heard from them at all. It should be noted that they initially attempted to give everyone vouchers valid for about 6 months instead of money paid for cancelled flights (illegal). Unfortunately have had to go the charge back route to obtain money owed for no service provided and my bank has advised they are disputing this - under what grounds I am unclear. Even budget carriers have treated their customers with more respect at this time. Avoid.

### "has shown no customer service"
Etihad has shown no customer service on our flights, during the cancellation period and responding to our complaint. Budget airlines take much better care of their customers than Etihad and that’s fact. They apologise only for the impact of covid 19, but not for the awful treatment during our outbound flight (pre covid 19) and what happened following the cancelled flight and the subsequent lack of response from Etihad until we used a complaint  website. But they have still decided to close our complaint with no apology, no explanation and no refund that we requested on 15 Apr 20. Etihad had a Duty of Care for its guests. Covid 19 was out of their control but that doesn’t allow them to just leave passengers stranded in a foreign country without, food, accommodation, money and no way of getting back to their home country. Sleeping on the airport floor, stressed and upset and not knowing how we will get home. No Etihad staff available for help we were just left there to sort it ourselves. We managed to get a flight back to the UK 5 days later and paid silly money. Etihad have not apologised or explained why they did not help or assist stranded passengers following the cancellation. We just cannot believe that an airline like Etihad would treat its customers so poorly. No explanation or apology. It has taken 17 e-mails and phone calls to their CEO and 3 other executives, Customer Services, Feedback Team and Etihad Guest to get a 1 line response – “COVID 19” and the case has been closed. The flight was cancelled due to COVID-19 which we understand is out of their control, however, this doesn’t give Etihad the green light to abandon their passengers. Requested our flight refund on 15 Apr and have not received a penny as at 24 Aug 20. Rude and unhelpful staff on the outbound flight. Cancelled returned flight 1.5 hours prior to take off. Finally offered us $60 bonus credit and 2,500 Etihad Guest miles but our refund had to be a credit note. Why would we want to fly with an airline that treats their customers so badly? Our additional expenses reached £1,500 and we are still struggling to pay this off. The one-way flight for 2 home was £1188 and Etihad offers us a refund of £304, which we are still waiting for. We bought and paid for 2 return flights to Bangkok and that’s what we should be given!

### "still trying to get a refund back after fifteen weeks"
I have flown a few times with Etihad. As an airline I find them slightly above average. I am a frequent flyer with Platinum Status so I get to use their first class lounge which is amazing. The food and service in this lounge is fantastic. However I have had a food mix up once where I didn't eat for fourteen hours and they had no back up plan. On the negative side I am still trying to get a refund back after fifteen weeks. Their website refers to refunds in 45 days but because I booked through a travel agent they wont help me directly. They can't give me any information and keep referring me back to the travel agent. Corporate Traveller is the travel agent and they tell me they have escalated this and are still waiting on Etihad. This run around and no direct answer is driving me nuts. It is not just my flight but my partners as well as I was due to get married. Etihad monitors their complaints and tell you publicly they will fix it but don't do anything "Etihad does not hold monies for any third party reservations". They tell you to ask the travel agent to contact their Etihad sales representative etc. Would prefer a quick conference call with the travel agent and Etihad to fix this. I will continue to review them on as many different websites as possible to warn other travelers that may expect to get a refund, 15 weeks is a bit much and still counting for a refund.

### "Information inaccurate and inconsistent"
Aug 7 Called Etihad and instructed to re-book Aug 8 flight for Aug 10 flight due to delay in COVID testing results. Aug 7-8 Etihad failed to re-book Aug 9 Called again and instructed to rebook for Aug 10 - Etihad failed to re-book Aug 9 Called third time and instructed to rebook flight - Etihad rebooked for Aug 10 and charged "Change fee". Aug 10 - Notified at Raleigh Durham Airport by American Airlines that Etihad had cancelled my American Airlines Domestic and Etihad international flight without notification to me. Aug 10 - Etihad representatives were unsuccessful in re-booking flight within 45 minutes causing flight to be missed. Complaint: Etihad does not allow the user to re-book flights at this time. Etihad failed to re-book flight in time to avoid "No Show" fee. Etihad cancelled customer flight due to human error. Caused customer one week of lost wages due to canceling flight without notification to flight customer. Did not honor carriage contract. Approximately 150.00 USD inappropriately charged for "no-show" fee. Information provided to customers is inaccurate and inconsistent.

### "better service on some flights"
Not Verified | The focus was on making sure everything was sanitized and for this reason meal service was not at the request but everyone had to dine at the same time. We were explained this was due to sanitization of the kitchen but only onboard. Our special meal was a bit disappointing and small and combined with not being able to order more was a bit of an inconvenience. Knowing this, I would have eaten more in the lounge and then slept through the flight instead FAs were reasonably attentive but you had to ask if you wanted another drink; there were not so many rounds of asking the passengers if they needed anything. The seat was as good as it gets - the best aircraft Etihad has to offer. But some wear was noticeable. The cabin was half-empty. Overall you can get better service on some flights or different airlines but if prices were lower and this would be the new standard it would still be a pleasant way to travel. The baggage allowance was generous (main motivation for flying BC) and check-in smooth despite having a few kgs extra.

### "I would not recommend them"
Not Verified | Flight cancelled due to Covid-19. Fair enough. When called, they only have schedule until October so cannot move booking. I also had to cancel the last 2 flights as I would be charged a no show for them even though they cancelled the first 2. Have not had airport tax back, anything. They are vague on the phone. I also had bookings with BA and CX who could not have been easier to deal with. I don't mind a voucher I can use at Christmas of 2021 but sadly not even that. When an airline changes its terms and conditions and starts quoting them you know are in trouble. A costly mistake indeed. I would not recommend them.

### "will not refund me"
Etihad cancelled my flight and will not refund me. I booked my family on this flight so we've lost a lot of money. I tried calling (now they removed all contact numbers) to no avail. I went to their office address and they closed their offices. Online, Etihad wants me to reschedule our flights for October 2020 but obviously we can't make that decision for now because it is still unsafe to travel. I opted to have a refund and they cut me off online. I cannot login or manage my flight on their website. I only want what is fair which is to get my money back because that is what any decent airline should do.

### "avoiding their responsibility"
Not Verified |  We recently flew with Etihad Airways, what a mistake. They broke my hard shell suitcase which I had paid $399 for, so not a cheap suitcase. We reported it to Customer Service at the airport in Abu Dhabi the morning after we arrived, as we arrived at approximately 1am, and were told to ‘claim online’ and no further discussion was entered into as he was on his mobile phone. The following day, leaving Abu Dhabi we reported it at the Check-in Counter. Just as bluntly we were told “claim online”. Once we were home, we contacted Customer Service, and were told “you need the luggage claim tags and the tags from your bag from that flight”. The tags required from my bag had been removed by the Check-in Counter staff upon check in to apply the new flight tags, and the old luggage claim tickets were discarded once the new luggage claim tickets were issued. It was never mentioned that we should keep them to make a claim. They have refused to take responsibility for their actions, and cut us off completely saying try your Travel Insurance. Also, flying with them means uncertainty. Every single flight we had with Etihad did not leave at the specified time. Before we even got to the airport nearly every flight had been changed, several times and they were usually late departing anyway. They do not care about their customers and obviously do not take any responsibility for their careless treatment of luggage. Insulting their passengers and avoiding their responsibility is their speciality. This has been ongoing now for over 5 months, still with no resolution. They state that because we have no tags, they are not paying for the damage their staff caused. We keep getting shoved all over the place, and NOBODY is willing to help to solve this.

### "not received any transfer of funds"
I first booked and paid ($3,763AUD) for multi city flights from Australia to Europe and China, with Etihad on 26 Nov 2019 for myself and my wife. Due to personal reasons we had to cancel our planned European holiday. I rang Etihad and cancelled the flights on 14 Dec 2019 – obviously well before the worldwide shutdown due to the Covid19 pandemic. Finally on 6 Jan after another phone call, Etihad sent me an email confirming the cancellation and a ‘generous’ refund of $1,362AUD. Following 12 phone calls, 9 emails and 26 weeks, I still do not have a refund. Etihad allege that a refund has been made, according to their records, however my bank has not received any transfer of funds. Two weeks ago I asked for proof of the refund. Guess what. I’m still waiting for proof. Numerous times, speaking with Etihad consultants, I’ve been promised that they will call back. But surprise surprise no call back. Does anyone know who I can escalate this issue to, considering I’m based in Australia?

### "$3500 in cancellation fees"
Melbourne to Athens via Abu Dhabi. Booked 5 tickets to fly to Greece to attend a wedding, Told by the travel agent Prahran Travel that our flights have been cancelled and all flights are cancelled for the next month. They offered us a credit note or we cancel our trip incurring $3500 in cancellation fees for a flight the Airline cancelled. Contacted the Airline directly and they confirmed the cancellation Fee. Contacted our travel insurance to be told not covered under the "Covid pandemic Clause" contacted the credit card provider "Not covered".

### "refund would take a further 28 days"
I booked three business class seats on return tickets - Melbourne to Cairo and back via Amman & Abu Dhabi to Melbourne. Departing 19th April with a return on the 7th May 2020. The tickets were purchased on 29th Nov 2019. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic I cancelled our family holiday on the 11th March 2020. I was told by Etihad that our refund would be $8,471.60 per ticket - $ 25,414.80 in total. It is now the 20th May and we have only received a one ticket refund. That ticket was our daughter’s. Which my wife’s and I paid for. The amount was for $8,171.60. Paid into our daughter’s bank account. This amount is different to what I was told back on the 11th March. No explanation to as to why the difference. I have had numerous communications with Etihad. Every time, our, refund claim was recognised and confirmed. Every time they used delaying tactics and lies. The last communication was on the 14th April confirming our refund would take a further 28 days to arrive. It is now the 20th of May 2020.

### "Cheap profiteering attitude"
My flights from New York to Chennai via Abu Dhabi was cancelled by Etihad Airways. Except for the cancellation message which gave details of miles, credits (which is of no use for me as I don't have a option to travel in future) nothing was specified about refund. Their contact centres too couldn't be contacted in real sense. Only recorded message. Finally I got them in my Twitter  and they immediately messaged to come into a Direct Message. But I learnt that they were keen on charging me for their cancellation which shows their cheap profiteering attitude & unjust trade practices. As per standard fare rules they can charge a customer if the Customer cancels ticket. But they argue that since I agreed to the terms & conditions I should pay for the cancellation of flight though it was done by Etihad Airways which sounds absurd. Cheap profiteering attitude at times of pandemic.

### "Refusing to refund flights"
Refusing to refund flights they cancelled! Last month Etihad cancelled my return flights to Europe. I was very surprised to be told I would only be given a credit voucher, not a refund. Etihad Conditions of Carriage state clearly at 10.2 Involuntary Refunds that they will give you a full refund if they can't provide the service. Etihad is refunding customers from US, EU, UK. They are trying to deceive AU customers about their rights. I will get my refund eventually, but I will never fly with Etihad ever again.

### "given the run around by Etihad"
Not Verified |  After being given the run around by Etihad, the travel agent and PayPal, I finely decided to contact MasterCard about raising a chargeback for a cancelled flight to Hanoi. I was informed by MasterCard that under EU law, any EU airlines or flights departing from EU airports are covered for cancellations under EU law and that the airline should refund within 7 days! Obviously they are trying to hold on to the passengers money and trying to force them into accepting something else or nothing at all! MasterCard told me that they would start chargeback proceedings and that I might also be covered under section 75 credit card act (UK law) which states that any online purchases between £100-£30,000 are covered and if the merchant doesn’t reimburse them the card company is liable and they will need to pay up. Unfortunately, if you use a 3rd party such as PayPal you might not be able to benefit from this additional cover. So, although I haven’t got anything back yet it is definitely looking more promising then just listening to the travel agent, PayPal or Etihad.

### "behavior is unacceptable"
I bought two tickets in February 2020 on Etihad to fly back home to see our families and relatives. Due to the current situation our flights have been cancelled by them and, as many other people, we can’t go back home. After many hours on the phone and all the e-mails sent explaining our situation as international students living overseas and struggling to make ends meet at the end of the month, their response is to rebook the flights and keep the money as Etihad credits to spend within 1 year. They lied to us saying they will escalate the claim, but that never happened. Every time we called back, they didn’t have anything mentioned in our flight profile. In the flight cancelation e-mail they send to us, there’s a mention about the refund policy, saying some customers might be eligible for a full refund. So we asked for a full refund of our money. They reply with a three line e-mail, with the comment “Our response is fair. Respectfully, this case is now closed.” Their e-mails show a total lack of empathy with the customer, not caring at all about the situation or any explanation we could give. It’s totally unethical and outright immoral from Etihad to treat their customers as they do. Unfortunately, our experience with the company is the same as many other customers. Now, they force us to travel with them again, even if we don’t want to do it anymore. They force us to leave our thousands dollars in their accounts for their own benefit. This behavior is unacceptable for an international airline. We are very unhappy with the customer service and recommend not to use this airline.

### "service was excellent"
Not Verified |  Manchester to Bangkok via Abu Dhabi. Was very pleased with my flight to BKK. Clean modern plane, the service was excellent, food & drink were very good. Entertainment was also pretty good, plenty to watch on the TV monitor. I had enough room in my seat, leg room was ok. All in all very happy with Etihad.

### "refusing to refund my fare"
I was booked with Etihad from Istanbul to Dubai and then Dubai to London. They are refusing to refund my fare, despite the fact that they cancelled the flights. They are offering credit which I can not use and will lose all my money. They have advised that they reviewed their waver policy in response to Covid 19. How can they change conditions after I have purchased my tickets. All other airlines I was booked with on this trip, Qatar, Turkish and Finnair have refunded me in full. Trying to deal with Etihad’s customer relations is an absolute disgrace. I will be escalating my complaint but am wondering where else , or who else. I can lodge a complaint with.

### "refusing to offer any refund"
Not Verified |  Etihad have cancelled my flight but are refusing to offer any refund only a credit. They cannot deliver the service that I have paid for but will not refund. I am also booked to return to Sydney with Qatar and they are offering a refund. I will never book with Etihad again.

### "Shame on you Etihad"
Not Verified |  A few days ago I bought my flight to go back home from Cairns to Milan on the date 6th of May 2020. This morning I received their mail saying that 1 out of the 4 flights has been cancelled (the one from Abu Dhabi to Europe). So I called Ethiad to either find a different solution to go home or to get my refund. The answer was that their government has suspended all the travels to and from Abu Dhabi (so why just one flight has been cancelled and not all of them?!). Then I discovered that the same thing happened to other people weeks ago, so this means they knew already they couldn’t bring me home when they sold me the ticket, and that makes it even dodgier! Going back to the phone call with their customer service, they said there is no alternative flight at the moment cause they don’t know when they will be able to fly again. Fair enough, refund then! No. According to their policy, they don’t do a refund but just credit that I can use within 1 year. I don’t want a credit. How can a company behave in this way? Especially during a global emergency! How can you take advantage of poor people that are just trying to get home while stuck in another country? With the money you owe me, I could buy a new ticket with a more professional and ‘human’ company. Shame on you Etihad.

### "Disgusting customer service"
Brisbane to Belgrade via Abu Dhabi. Disgusting customer service, no appreciation for loyality. We were supposed to fly out 06.04.20, for obvious reasons flights were cancelled. Submitted full refund online on the 16.03.20 at the time this was allowed, well, two weeks on, they changed their policy. Apparently they are allowed to do this, now 5 weeks later, nothing. Travel agent is not answering emails, last communication, was that they were waiting on Etihad. I have contacted anyone who would reply at Etihad Airways from gold guest services, customer feedback, fb messenger, and they all say, the fare has been refunded to the agent.

### "Our flight was very pleasant"
Not Verified |  Myself and my wife booked our flight from Chicago to Mumbai and return from Bangalore to Chicago. After our tour in North India and Mumbai we were planning to go to Kerala and fly back from Bangalore. Due to the Corona virus spread in Kerala and Karnataka we were stranded in Mumbai. We decided to return from Mumbai to Chicago. I contacted the Ethihad airlines and explained our situation and requested to change our ticket from Mumbai to Chicago for 3/25/2020. Without any problem we were scheduled to fly back on 3/25/2020. Situation in Kerala, Karnataka and Maharastra were getting worse and we decided to return home on an early flight. Contacted the airlines on 3/20/23020. They understood the situation and rescheduled for our flight for 3/22/2020 which was the last flight left from India and had only two seats left on that flight in the business class. The customer service representative was very kind to meet our urgent need. Our flight was very pleasant and comfortable. The hostesses were friendly and professional.

### "unethical and outright immoral"
Abu Dhabi to Dublin. We are all well aware of the current, I would say crisis globally. One would feel that many airlines are now under serious pressure to stay afloat be they government or private operations , and we as customers understand this as well as empathise with them and more so the impact to their employees. I had a flight booked back since Jan 2020 for may 8th, it was cancelled as I understand and naturally appreciated the update well in advance at April 16th. Being a loyal gold member for many years I am used to the limitations airlines go through. What I do not appreciate and this is not for me but for persons who have booked Base fares or sales fares is that Etihad Policy is as per your ticket if they cancel a flight it is you who suffers. They push the credit to the Etihad bank so can reuse the cash amount in the next 8 months? But the best part is that if you decide that you don't feel that you can fly in the future they will refund you but based only on your ticket criteria and the premise that you had voluntarily cancelled (although you had not ) meaning you get 5 % to nothing just taxes back refund. This is outrageous, unethical and out right immoral. A shameful practice for any one who may not have the luxury to fly often and spend their hard earned money on annual or Bi annual ticket home to see family. Etihad I have been loyal to you but this is a new low, shame on you. As I have said it is not me as I am lucky to be able to bank the credit but other people who can not, you have taken their money with an cavalier arrogance.

### "no option for a refund"
Bangkok to Athens via Abu Dhabi. I have already two canceled tickets and this one is the third one! They were accepting bookings until 16th of April for the flights in May, surprisingly they had the cheapest tickets to come back to Europe. I booked the flight on 13th  April and on 16th they canceled everything for any destination in Europe. Of course there is no option for a refund on the website.

### "refusing to give full refunds"
Sydney to London via Abu Dhabi. Etihad are refusing to give full refunds to customers for flights cancelled. Instead they are offering credit. This is worse than useless. We are severely out of pocket and don't know when or when we will be able to fly again. All we want is for you to give us back the money.

### "don’t care for their customers"
Not Verified |  Sent them a message to change our flight because of Corona to another date and from another place. It says that you can change the ticket and the place for free. We wanted to leave 4 weaks earlier back home because we were scared that they would close the airport in the country where we are. They stopped flying for 2 weeks and changing the flight online is not possible. They are also not working together with other airlines to bring their customers home. You are forced to wait and only to fly back home with them. They don’t inform you and they don’t even care. They just send you some standard messages when you ask them a question and no options offered at all. Now, our original flight is cancelled so we booked with Qatar Airways and pay again. We will send Etihad Airways a message to give us a refund, they only offer vouchers but we are not accepting this, not only because they cancelled but also because they don’t care for their customers.

### "acted terribly in this crisis"
Not Verified |  Sydney to Dublin via Abu Dhabi. Flights cancelled twice and refund was not given as an option in their cancellation email. Only a change of date or a credit to be used before Sept 2020. We are in the middle of a large crisis and they expect me to book a holiday in the midst of this? I eventually booked through another airline who got me home. I then rang customer service to request a refund as they could not provide me a flight to get home. I was eventually offered a refund but I was charged circa 350 australian dollars for the refund and wont receive for another 2 to 3 weeks. I found Etihad has acted terribly in this crisis, taking advantage of those in dire circumstances to keep their cash flow up. I will avoid in future going forward.

### "Worse than a low cost carrier"
Barcelona to Delhi via Abu Dhabi. Worse than a low cost carrier. Terrible leg room and seat comfort. No IFE. Food cold and inedible. One of the worst Economy classes I have ever been in.

### "they cancelled our flight"
Melbourne to Amsterdam via Abu Dhabi. Very disappointed about Etihad Airways. Within 36 hours after purchasing our ticket, they cancelled our flight. We asked for a full refund of the ticket price, but they said that due to the COVID 19 outbreak they won't pay us back. Etihad Airways is violating passenger rights. Other big and high-quality airlines are providing their customers with a full refund. I really hope that they swiftly change this policy.

### "not worth the amount of money that I paid"
This is the worst airline I have ever used. Seats are old and not comfortable. I am 6'2" and I wasn't able to extend my legs more than 70% because there wasn't enough space to lay completely flat. Food is max premium economy but not more. If you ever flew with Qatar Airways, then you know what I mean. One meal was chicken, that was so dry that I had to return it! One meal was served with fish but as I don't eat fish, I asked for a different meal. Stewardess offered instead to remove the fish from my plate, which would leave me still with the fish smell! At snacks (nuts and stale cookies) for the rest of my flight! Had only 2 steak sandwiches on board and ran out after 2 hours into the flight, even though it was supposed to be available all the time. These things happened on all 4 business flights I used. The only thing constantly available was nuts and cookies (cookies were old and stale, soggy). Coffee machine was spoiled, so no latte for me on my return flight to Singapore. As I traveled there with Ethiad already, I can tell you that this is not an exception but a constant thing. Entertainment was outdated. No movies from late 2019 or 2020! Music was outdated as well. On my first flight from Singapore to Abu Dhabi, the stewardesses seemed absent and not properly trained for business class. The other flights the stewardesses were better but definitely not business class worthy. Had to change seats after takeoff because my window was loudly vibrating and the engine was super loud as well. Etihad got rid of the concierge service outside of Abu Dhabi as well. When I arrived in Germany and back at Singapore, I was completely exhausted and needed 2 days to recover. All-in-all not worth the amount of money that I paid. Going back to Qatar Airways, where I get superior service and quality food and I know that the airplanes are maintained properly and a free concierge service around the world. Sad, as this used to be a great airline until they got into financial trouble.

### "never been so uncomfortable"
Abu Dhabi to Bangkok. What a startling contrast to the first leg in from London on the A380, it was so badly different that I thought I was with a different airline. As this was a night flight I didn't eat until breakfast, which was fruit and coffee and was absolutely fine. Can't comment on the other food. For me the worst part of this was the old, dated and unbelievably uncomfortable seats and configuration being used in business class. I flew with Eithad on their A380 and Boeing 787 aircraft and you literally cannot compare! I have never been so uncomfortable in a seat, having flown economy lots of times historically - it was shocking. We flew for the majority of the flight through various level of turbulence (can't be helped of course) needless to say, I felt each and every bump due to the poor quality of the seat. Etihad, this product is severely letting you down! I would definitely reconsider flying this route again unless I knew for certain it wasn't on this aircraft.

### "comfortable and relaxing experience"
London Heathrow to Abu Dhabi. Check in, quick and efficient. What a superior aircraft the A380 is! The seat was extremely spacious and comfortable. The staff were efficient and super friendly. In flight entertainment was plentiful and varied. The food was ok, wasn't bad in any way, some of the dishes simply weren't for me. A comfortable and relaxing experience all round, would fly Etihad again on this aircraft.

### "don't care about customers"
Shame on Etihad Airways. They don't care about customers. No money refund, they offered me only $3 or rebook to fly again next time. I need money back to fly with another airlines. Even AirAsia refunded me 100%.

### "highly recommended"
Singapore to Manchester via Abu Dhabi. Treated myself to business class, could not fault the staff, attentive, polite, asked for an extra pillow & amenity kit which was no trouble, kept on re-filling my champagne glass, food was great, best sleep i’ve had on a plane, highly recommended.

### "did not offer any alternative"
Not Verified |  Bangkok to Brussels via Abu Dhabi. Due to the Corona crises they cancelled a ton of flights. They did not offer any alternative and warned only two days before departure. Instead of offering a full refund, they give you Etihad credit or cancellation with some cost. Also it is impossible to reach and when you get through you can hardly understand the operator. They only care about their dollars. Big minus.

### "profiting off the desperation"
Melbourne to London. Etihad doesn't even have the money I paid for my ticket in their accounts yet and they're still trying to charge a $622 cancellation fee despite the fact they cancelled the flight! Their only other option is credit for a future flight which is not helpful as highly unlikely to materialise in the near future. This is awful. They can't provide the service so they should refund. The only option remaining is for my bank to dispute the charge as fraudulent and that's not a sure thing and could take weeks. Vulnerable travellers are desperate to get home and these awful vultures are still selling flights they know they can't fulfil!! Etihad is profiting off the desperation.

### "avoid Etihad at all cost"
Male to London via Abu Dhabi. Etihad cancelled our flights from Male, Maldives without notifying us in advance. Cancellation of the flights received by email 15min before check in counters opened! Etihad washed their hands and their representative did not offer any flight alternatives. Unable to leave the airport as Male city is off limits for foreigners. No one has provided basics such as water or food. Please avoid Etihad at all cost in the future!

### "did not provide alternative options"
Nursultan to Abu Dhabi. Since Kazakhstan introduced the Quarantine regime. Etihad Airways canceled the flight, and did not provide alternative options for returning tourists to their homeland. They Offering to return the cost of a return ticket, in the amount of $65 per person! but, the cost of tickets is much more expensive. In fact, tourists were simply left without the possibility of returning A self-respecting airline will not do that ! !! And at least he will offer to transfer to another flight, and another airline! There must be some kind of interchange! And it outrages! Now, the opinion of Etihad Airways is spoiled. Please somehow make an impact on this airline. Because, my tourists had to buy tickets on their own.

### "holds its passengers to ransom"
Singapore to London via Abu Dhabi. I thought it would be unwise to travel to Singapore with my 77yr old mother with underlying health conditions. I asked Etihad to reroute straight back to the Uk from Trivandrum via Abu Dhabi on the 21 March instead of 25th March via singapore. They asked £800 for both of us. I am disgusted at the way holds its passengers to ransom during a pandemic. Traveller be careful before with airlines who hold you to ransom. No thanks to Etihad Airways and my family will avoiding this airline.

### "I won't fly with them again"
Not Verified |  Cochin to London via Abu Dhabi. We paid for seat upgrades on both legs of the journey but they did not match up with what we paid for. The cabin crew had to move us on the first leg as they had put a child next to the emergency exit - also we had paid for a window seat but didn't get one. I wrote to Etihad about this and they replied 'Thanks for your comments we look forward to you flying with us again' or something along those lines. I wrote again saying we did not get what we paid for and they have written back saying according to their records we did. The flight itself was ok - my issue is really with the dismissive customer service response since then. As a result of that I won't fly with them again but so what? They don't need my money or custom.

### "didn’t give us all the money back"
Athens to Abu Dhabi booked for 16th March. Because of the COVID-19 situation we were told to stay home, therefore we couldn’t travel. But even under those circumstances they didn’t give us all the money back.

### "they will not allow any changes"
Not Verified |  Chicago to Cairo via Abu Dhabi. We have a trip planned in the upcoming weeks, and have tried to cancel our flights but as the countries we are traveling to are not on their current affected “list” they will not allow any changes. The seriousness of this pandemic is changing daily. Considering the outbreak developing in the USA, the restrictions being put in place on international flights, quarantines being forced, and the ease of transmission of the virus we do not feel safe leaving our home country. Etihad Airways has refused to acknowledge our situation and give us any options. It is during time such as this that we can differentiate between companies that put safety and customers first, and those that only think about themselves.

### "our seats have been overbooked"
Not Verified |  Sydney to Amsterdam via Abu Dhabi. We arriving to Sydney and checked in, I asked the Etihad agent for the boarding pass for the second leg and he assured me that we would collect this from the desk once we arrived to Abu Dhabi. I questioned the check-in agent as that has never happened to me before, and he assured me that it was an issue with printing and that it would be waiting for me at the business class lounge. Once we arrived we were asked continuously for the boarding pass and questioned why we didn’t get receive this in Sydney. We reiterated that the agent confirmed we would collect from the desks here in Abu Dhabi, this was a lie. They told us that we should have received both boarding passes and that our seats have been overbooked, therefor bumping us off our paid seats. We were offered another seat in Economy and that was it. There was no other flights that we were offered to us in the same class at another time of day. Etihad didn’t even offer to refund us the cost of our ticket, they gave us a partial refund of $300, which was a little insulting. I found the way that this news was conveyed to us really disappointing especially since the agent would have known at the time we checked in at Sydney and he did not notify us but rather lied to us.

### "do not worry about their customers"
Not Verified |  I booked my trip to India on March 14, but due to the coronavirus  outbreak India government suspended all existing visa to India and due to that I have to cancel or reschedule my travel later. I was planing to reschedule all the ticket to another date after April 15th as per the Indian government announcement. But Etihad is not allowing to do so and they need reschedule charge $200 for each Indian passport holders. And their help center is worst and I was trying hours for last 3 days to connect to their customer service center and they do not even have sufficient help center support. And also they are not even ready to understand the customer's situation and they are just worried about money. They do not worry about their customers.

### "I had very nice flight flights"
I had very nice flight flights with Etihad. Clean aircraft, tasty vegetarian meal - served in a nice way. Cabin crew very attentive. I believe that the level represented by Etihad does not differ from the standards of airlines in this region.

### "putting profit ahead of people"
Booked to travel Sydney to Amsterdam via Abu Dhabi on 18 March. Etihad isn’t being sympathetic to people and treating the current situation like normal and making me pay for a conference that is cancelled in Amsterdam because of coronavirus. Etihad Airways should be ashamed putting profit ahead of people!

### "not showing caring for customers"
My friend and I had booked my flight from Casablanca-SINGAPORE with transit in Abu Dhabi on Jan 4. However, upon our flight back to Singapore on Jan 4, The airline had changed our booking without our authorization. We only know this information 1.5 hours before departure at the check-in counter in Casablanca Airport. Our flight had changed from Casablanca to Abu Dhabi to Singapore to Casablanca to Abu Dhabi-Colombo to Singapore with neither prior notification Nor consent, causing an additional 4.5-5 hours layover at Sri Lanka which is completely beyond my expectation. This is not only additional hours wasted but also a strain on Our energy and comfort, having suffered from two transits in Abu Dhabi and Colombo, compared to only one that we initially booked. After confirming with Etihad, they said that the change of my flight is due to overbooking. I had written an email to Etihad to file an official complaint. Their staff from Guest Relations had replied after a long waiting of 14 days. They offer me compensation for USD200 travel credit. I had explained to them that as I live in South-east Asia, it is not convenient to use the credit, as most of their flight routes are in Europe. I hope they could consider our situation and offer us other options. However, Etihad is so inconsiderable and totally not showing caring for customers. They just simply ignoring our emails and not replying to us.

### "appalled by its current state"
Not Verified |  Abu Dhabi to Toronto. Previously, I had flown on Etihad a few times to the UK and to South Africa a few years ago. Those trips  were wonderful, and the only reason I did not become a regular flyer was due to the fact that the airport was far for me. After flying Etihad Airways this time, I was appalled by its current state. The inflight entertainment was very limited, the staff were uncaring and the food was terrible. I doubt I'd travel again on it.

### "avoid Etihad Airways at all costs"
Dubai to Kuwait via Abu Dhabi. When booking this trip, I should have been wary at the prospect of involving two different airlines and a bus. But I wasn't and dearly paid for it. The first portion of my trip from Kuwait to Dubai on Emirates was very pleasant and without incident. My return trip was anything but. The itinerary had me boarding a bus from the Etihad "bus terminal" in Dubai. That was to take me to the Abu Dhabi airport where I would take an Etihad Airways plane back to Kuwait. Problems began right from the beginning when the driver picked me up from my hotel. He had no idea where the bus terminal was, so I suggested he google it, which he did; however, the address listed on the Etihad website was incorrect. Hence, we were quite confused when we arrived at the destination. The driver got out of his car and asked a few people and learned where the actual address was. Once we arrived, I learned there was no proper bus terminal at all, only a podium with an Etihad sign behind it located inside a shopping center. Once at the airport check in, I learned they were charging me $96 to check in my small suitcase - something that has never happened to me with any other airline I've taken. I was too tired to argue, however, so I just paid the unexpected fee. The flight back to Kuwait offered nothing in the form of entertainment, and the skimpy sandwich and small container of water was not worthy of a world-class airline. Once back on the ground I was relieved the flight was not any longer than it had been. Moreover, I realized I had learned some important lessons about choosing airlines in the future. Above all, I will avoid Etihad Airways at all costs.

### "highly recommend this airline"
We had the opportunity to fly with Etihad Airways in both business and economy class and the service onboard and the crew attendance was perfect and for sure much better than a lot of airlines we traveled=. Even if it is not possible to compare economy service with a business class one, we experienced the same services and attendance where, in respect to their cabin very good. we found that the crews were deploying the same energy  in economy or in business in order to meet our expectations onboard. The entertainment system is very good and offers a lot of possibilities (inflight cameras, maps, a lot of recent movies, games, inflights chat and talks between seats, wifi etc etc). The screens in economy are large and seats recline are good for an economy class (Boeing 787 and A321). Seats in Business are the most comfortable I have experienced. The menu is very refined and very well presented. The Etihad lounge in Abu Dhabi is fabulous and beyond our expectations. We highly recommend this airline for their business class and their economy and for the attention given to the customers during the flights.

### "worst airline I have flown"
London to Sydney via Abu Dhabi in August 2019. The worst airline I have flown with, they would not move me when my seat was broken. My seat 37A was broken and would no recline, the touch screen for my seat did not work so I was unable to watch any inflight entertainment and the charge ports did not work. I told the air hostess about these issue to which said that she was aware, but it was a very full flight. We had to ask for our food as we were skipped and there was no option left which was something with cream in the mash. Refreshments came around so rarely that after having just purchased water bottles, that were taken off us before boarding, we had to ask for water to be told that they would be round soon with refreshments to then wait another hour for water was ridiculous. I got up to use the toilets closest to my seat and was told by the flight attend that I should use the one further up that had about 6/7 people queuing outside it, I asked her if I could not use the one closest as they were both unoccupied, she let out a loud sigh a moved her trolley ever so slightly so I could squeeze past. This was by far the worst plane journey I have ever experienced and am appalled that this level of service was deemed acceptable on a long hall flight.

### "charge me for the upgrade twice"
Flew from Ahmedabad to Amsterdam with Etihad. At the airport I decided to upgrade to Business. However Etihad has decided to charge me for the upgrade twice! I tried to resolve it with customer services but they don't seem to be bothered. Had to issue a charge back via my bank. Avoid!

### "Was really disappointed"
Chicago to Abu Dhabi. Was really disappointed, staff were not nice, my seat was dirty. Staff on Check in back was really unprofessional. I will never fly with this airline again and do not recommend them.

### "selling some snacks on board"
I traveled twice on this route (Seychelles to Mumbai via Abu Dhabi) in this month. They use old equipment on this route. The quantity of food served is very little, compared to what was offered earlier. They are selling some snacks on board. I do not know, why they started this practice. If they have observed that, food was being wasted, they could offer second serving of bread & butter at least. The worst part is Abu Dhabi - Mumbai sector. There are no screens for IFE. You are supposed to download their app and use your own smartphone to view the programs. Otherwise the flight was okay. The ticket cost varied two much, for my two trips. But that is another story. One more good thing is that, though I could not book my special meals, as I booked on the last day, still meal of my choice was available on the flight.

### "totally disappointed"
Not Verified |  Toronto to Ahmadabad via Abu Dhabi. Had high hopes of good service with this carrier- totally disappointed. From the check in(Hand baggage was allowed up to 12 kgs but their staff insisted each passenger to have exact distribution of 5kgs and 7 kgs, cannot understand why the displacement of 1-2 kgs more or less in each hand carriage would make any difference, ultimately when they realized they were being overwhelmed by delays in checking in passengers they overrode the requirement. On our in bound trip I we were crammed in very tight spaces, the entertainment did not function with loose wires dangling from the remote and the system would not even function manually, went through a 12 hour flight without any music, or entertainment. We had the same problem on our return flight 15 days later, we arrived well in advance of the check in time at the counters, the staff checked us in, stating we had to pay for 2 kgs extra baggage, then checked in our baggage, issued tags for our hand baggage, but at the security checkin prior to gate entry we were put on stand by again with the same issue of weight check of our hand held luggage, we were harassed to remove weights from the two allowed pieces and redistribute it until it was exact 5kgs and 7kgs. Could not understand why all these stringent requirements even when we showed them that the hand held pieces had our medications in them. We had requested vegetarian meals throughout all our flights, but the in flight crew argued that we should have requested this requirement at the time of booking our flights.

### "told tickets are cancelled"
We have booked flight from Chicago to Hyderabad return via Abu Dhabi. While return on 13th Feb 2020, my family (Wife and two small kids) has been told tickets are cancelled. Moreover, at boarding pass counter instead of trying to understand situation my wife disrespected by Etihad Employee. We travel to airport from different city within country. One should try to understand if any misunderstanding instead of shouting your flight is not today. Etihad Airways made me to pay $991 for same flight and same ticket.

### "they seated us separately"
London to Thiruvananthapuram via Abu Dhabi. Travelled for the first time on this Aircraft. Instead of giving us one middle seat for the four of us (as we had a 1 year old, where we booked the full seat as its a Long haul), they seated us separately! When requested if then can do anything they were like - it’s not their fault. I lost my, £300 headphone during that chaos. I didn’t take it anywhere else from my seat. At least they should email me saying they found it in my seat. When I emailed them the response was it’s not their responsibility and they gave it to the local authorities. No replies afterwards! We were in Abu Dhabi for the transit - and  what a mess no queues, nothing in place.

### "like to express my gratitude"
On February 12, we flew on flight EY21 from Abu Dhabi to Manchester and I would like to express my gratitude to the team in Economy class. The crew were friendly and attentive. My partner had a birthday the day we were flying and crew gave to my partner a nice gift and delicious fruit cake! The flight was pleasant.

### "never fly with Etihad again"
Delhi to Auckland via Abu Dhabi. Worst experience ever, they didn’t let me board the flight. I don’t have surname on my passport and I used “LNU” as last name because other airline asked us to use this for flight booking. Every airline accepted this except Etihad. I don’t know why they have issue with passengers using “LNU” when the passport itself doesn’t have my last name. Instead of helping and changing name as per their requirements they asked us to book another flight ticket for much higher fare than the fare we booked originally. I am so upset and frustrated with this and I will never fly with Etihad again.

### "very harrowing experience"
Colombo to Toronto via Abu Dhabi. A very harrowing experience, me and my family had Etihad Airways on my recent return from Colombo. We were to take the flight no EY267 on 21/12/19 from Colombo to Abu Dhabi and get the connecting flight the next morning from Abu Dhabi. We boarded the flight on time and it was to take off at 4.15 am. We were initially informed that the flight was delayed due local documentation issues with airport authorities. After two hours on board, once again announced delayed due documentation issues. After 3 hours on board the entire passengers were off loaded stating that there is technical hitch and the flight cannot take off. This was disappointing to us as we knew then and there that we cannot board the connecting flight to Toronto as the next Available flight was at 10.05 am next morning (Abu Dhabi time). We had no choice but to accept their offer to be put up at Shangrila Hotel in Colombo. At that time there were no sort of apology from Etihad staff for the inconvenience. When we asked for a glass of juice we were asked to pay only water was provided. We decided to walk out of the hotel and settle in at a nearby restaurant out of our pocket. We were asked to assemble at the lobby at 5 pm to proceed to the airport to board the flight at 9.45 pm to Abu Dhabi. But to our dismay when we reached the check in counter at the airport we were advised that we had to wait until next morning (4.15 am flight) to board the flight as we were traveling to Toronto. Once again the ground staff informed us that it’s their ground staff error boarding us to airport in the wrong bus. It was most unorganized way of handling passengers who had already undergone an extensive trauma from morning. To our irritation we were booked once again that night at Gateway Hotel which was of inferior standard. Finally we made it in the next morning on the flight to Abu Dhabi which was 24 hour detainment. We were fortunate that we made it to the connecting flight to Toronto without further hiccups. But once we boarded we found that the seats we had booked by paying extra CAD217.30 each (total CAD869.20), to be seated together, was not available. Only three seats were together and one seat was on the other row. Very disappointing. So we arrived in Toronto 24 hours late and had to adjust to time zone. I took up this with Etihad customer service and they offered $250 each as compensation that too a travel credit valid for a year, and they did say it’s final. So they are expecting me to travel again spending $1800.00 each to get their credit of $250.00 each? Absurd. Not up to the standard of known Etihad.

### "worst flight experience"
Not Verified |  Its a worst flight experience I ever had. My flight was Chicago to Medinah return via Abu Dhabi. Flight crews are OK. Economy seats are Very uncomfortable and so narrow you barely fit in it. Food is worse, cold and did not had taste, spoons are cheap plastic. Old movies and more.

### "not up to the usual Etihad standards"
Abu Dhabi to Colombo. This flight was rather cramped and not up to the usual Etihad standards. The aircraft was not a wide-bodied and the seating was 3+3. With the narrow leg room it felt very cramped especially since the flight was full. Trapped in a window seat I had great difficulty in getting to the toilet. Food and beverages was average. There was no entertainment, not even a single TV monitor on this 4hr flight. It certainly was not up to their usual standards.

### "they cannot issue my ticket"
Not Verified |  First of all I have been a Gold and now Silver member of Etihad for many years. The service they provide has got worse and worse over the years but at this moment I am writing to complain about the experience I have just had over the past week and a half. I purchased a ticket from Melbourne to Dublin (departure 16.2) on Sat 25 Jan paying with credit card&mileage. I was unsure on the website about the pricing at the time of booking, called Etihad team who assured me to proceed to the payment page. An error message came on the screen although the team member could see everything on his side. Money deducted, mileage deducted and no ticket sent. Etihad member assured me that there was no issue and to wait 24-48 hours for confirmation. I called on Fri 31.1 to express my worries about not receiving a ticket. They told me I would have my ticket within 24-48 hours for definite, promise sun moon and stars. It is now Monday 3rd Februrary and no ticket. Etihad has just confirmed there was a system error at time of booking and they cannot issue my ticket even thought they can see my money has been debited and my mileage debited also. They are refunding my money and my mileage and I have to book another ticket. This is not what I wanted, I wanted the ticket I paid for. The prices are now more expensive as it is the week before departure. Etihad said it was their system error not to issue the ticket. Why should I have to suffer due to their systems failures, shouldn't they rectify this for me as it is not my fault. As a silver member, my family and I travel to and from Europe every year with Etihad. My wife is a gold member and my daughter a platinum, we are all in shock at this treatment, wouldn't be recommending Etihad anytime soon.

### "the seating was very cramped"
Tokyo to Madrid via Abu Dhabi with Etihad Airways. I was expecting service similar to JAL, ANA, Singapore Airlines, Delta, etc., but the seating was very cramped, service was mediocre and the food was only OK. This isn't an airline to fly in economy. It feels like a very low-end airline in the economy section. My guess is they focus on first-class and business class, but don't have an airline culture to be bothered with economy class customers. Worst seating I've experienced outside of discount airlines such as Ryanair, Frontier or Wizz Air. Seat in front of me was mere inches from me and it is uncomfortable and claustrophobic on a 12-hour flight. My second flight was worse, as the seats did not recline. They have crammed the seats in the plane so close together that the seats, literally, can not be reclined, so they've disabled the buttons. I had high expectations based on Etihad's reputation, which made the reality and second class citizen feel of the flight all the more surprising.

### "experience was disheartening"
Dammam to Mumbai via Abu Dhabi. I traveled with my family for the first time under a good impression of Etihad claiming to provide a world class services but my experience was disheartening. Ground staff not at all supportive at Dammam and Abu Dhabi airport. Flight seems to have squeezed from inside as my seat was too tight for me and the travellers besides me to fit in. I kept my shoulders up tight for 3 hours just not to bother my fellow passengers. The best experience was having my food, It was a challenge to get the food from the tray to my mouth. I wish I would have taken a photograph and updated in this review. The cabin crew seems to own the flight and it looks like we have taken a free ride, cant express more about the experience with the cabin crew.

### "I would never recommend Etihad"
Mumbai to Los Angeles via Abu Dhabi. Our flight from Mumbai to Abu Dhabi was delayed by an hour, and my layover in AUH was for 2 hours - in which I had to complete my immigration and security and make it to my gate by boarding time. I get off the flight and there's someone standing with a board mentioning 'LAX flight passengers please assemble here. I assembled there thinking they would make way for us in the immigration because our flight was delayed, however, there were a few passengers on the connecting flight to LAX that went ahead and didn't bother assembling. Anyway, we waited and the staff says the LAX airport has called saying that theres a pre-load problem and so only restricted passengers can board the flight. After waiting for an hour, a man comes up to us and says "so theres a problem and only few passengers can board" - obviously everyone is extremely angry because they had tickets for the connecting flight. All students travelling alone obviously spoke up, including me, saying that we are travelling alone and so to give us priority as that would be easier than accomodating family. The man says "alright all those who are students give me you boarding passes", and us thinking this is us boarding the flight had him our boarding passes merrily, after a few minutes, he returns with our boarding passes and says "sorry you guys cant board the flight, there is no space and we will have to rebook you", and instead lets all the families go on. Then, he randomly chooses 5 passengers out of the students and says go on and board, I was one of them and i ran to the gate - on reaching someone tells me they're calling you back up. We wait for 5 hours, until I call up one of my dad's friend that talks to them and tells him to book us a flight - after which he books us a flight to shanghai and then SFO and then San Diego. He says "we are providing you with a 300 USD voucher" now this voucher is something that can only be used for Etihad services. I have never been in such a situation before and i was traumatized - i was at the airport from 7 am to 2 pm trying to rebook my flight without eating. The attendants didn't even have the decency to provide us with after repeatedly promising it. Not just this, there were just 7 of us remaining that couldn't board the flight out of say 60. Who gave staff the authority to randomly select passengers to board the flight? I would never recommend Etihad airways ever again.

### "A very good flight"
London to Abu Dhabi. A very good flight. Was not crowded and in fact was half empty with a nice distribution of passengers. Check-in was very pleasant although there were no check-in machines at LHR for Etihad. Seat configuration was 3+4+3 with very good legroom. Cabin service was very good as was the in-flight entertainment. We took off on time and landed at AUH before time.

### "customer care really poor"
Auckland to Zurich via Sydney / Abu Dhabi. Quality of customer care really poor. We were delayed 12h on the outward flight, making us miss an hotel room and very expensive train tickets. I wrote to the airline and they took more than 2 weeks to answer, refusing all compensation. The food quality and service are poor compared to similar airlines. They always leave the tray for a very long time before clearing. They refuse to refill water bottles but will give you many new water glasses, doesn't make sense.

### "Worst experience ever"
Manchester to Bangkok via Abu Dhabi. Check in, rude miserable unkempt staff who look like they’ve been on a night out rather than assisting passengers. Worst experience ever in all the years travelling. No regard for disability or assistance needed. Complaint sent into Etihad. Shambolic at boarding time. Business class Economy and Assisted passengers and families all hailed onto a bus at gate to go on a 20 min ride to the aircraft. The distress this causes assistance passengers. Communication between ground staff and cabin crew non existent. Food ok. Drinks ok. Entertainment ok. Leg room ok. Seat comfortable - not. Seats are hard and row 16 restrictive if disabled or any invisible illnesses. Disembarking and no assistance present. Again just left to work it out myself. Etihad, educate about invisible disabilities.

### "Not a good practice"
Abu Dhabi to Kuwait. Bad experience, I have put my correct name (first name and family name), however did not put my middle name and was charged KWD 32.5 which is above 100 dollars. Unfair. It's cheating by force. Not a good practice.

### "worst I've experienced"
Frankfurt to Kuala Lumpur via Abu Dhabi. My flight in September 2019 on Etihad Airways was by far the worst I've experienced in air travel over the last 30 years. Their behaviour utmost arrogant, ignorant and rude, no smiling on their faces. The service on board was mediocre,  the hot meal was cold, no options available - only a limited offer of drinks and snacks. Their overall performance (ground handling services, office/administration, sale and marketing ad service on board) are years away from those of the worlds leading airlines such as Singapore Airlines, Emirates and Qatar Airways.

### "service was good."
Abu Dhabi to Kathmandu. There was no inflight entertainment on board as you have to download E-Box and use your mobile device to access it. The food was good and service was good. The flight was smooth .

### "quite surprised of how good everything went"
Bangkok to Brussels. After many negative reviews we were curious what flying with Etihad was all about, I have to say, we had 4 flights all in all with them going to Bangkok and only the last flight from Abu Dhabi to Brussels was a bit of a bummer because the inflight entertainment was down. But for the rest of our flights, we were quite surprised of how good everything went. No problems and very friendly people in the in check zone. The flight attendants were very friendly and provided us regularly with drinks. The food didn't look very apetizing but was surprisedly tasty. Now I'm not the smallest of persons (193cm) but the legspace was well enough for me. When we got on the plane it looked clean but when we got off i pittied the people having to clean everything again. Most of the reviews here were very negative and I know people only talk when something bad happens but I think they deserve some good critics also so people who booked a ticket don't have to panic when they read all that bad comment. Well done Etihad.

### "Great food selection"
Not Verified |  Abu Dhabi to Johannesburg. Great cabin crew with good service. Flight departed on time and the lie flat seat on business is good. Great food selection and in flight entertainment selection.

### "no inflight entertainment system"
Not Verified |  Frankfurt to Kochi via Abu Dhabi. The first leg of the journey was good. But the flight from Abu Dhabi was pathetic. The flight was no better than any European low cost airliner. The flight was really old, with no inflight entertainment system. Every flyer had to download an APP to access their entertainment system which did not have half the options of the one that I had in my first leg of the journey. If you are traveling without a tab, then all that you can do is to sit idle for hours. The seats were really old and uncomfortable. Abu Dhabi airport is not the best either. There are very limited restaurants in Teminal 1 and 3 in the transit area. Basically I felt like paying huge amount of money for a budget airline like service.

### "not use this airline anymore"
Hong Kong to Paris via Abu Dhabi. My first and last flight with Etihad for now. Before I've heard lots of positive comments about this airline, but well, it doesn't live up to that positive praise . Let's start with a good: new aircraft, on time arrivals for me. Bad: meals are disgusting and amount of portions just like for the kids. 1 meal was served during 9 hours flight and before landing they gave a tiny pack of pretzels with a water. No blankets, no sleep eye covers. Rushed service. Something doesn't feel right for the price paid, so for now I will not use this airline anymore.

### "did not even pick up my call"
Los Angeles to Bangalore via Abu Dhabi. One of the worst international flights that I have ever taken, I am never going to take this airline, ever again even if it's of free ticket, very cheap crew who didn't even help me to pick up my late check-in bags. My bag stayed in LA for 5 days, I had to FedEx my own bags. The baggage claim that I had reported did nothing, they did not even pick up my call.

### "more like a budget airline"
Abu Dhabi to Paris. Last June and July 2019, I flew Etihad Airways from Jakarta to Paris via Abu Dhabi and return flight from Paris to Jakarta via Abu Dhabi. Etihad has to be the worst of any full service airlines I have flown. The seats in the Business Class is nothing special and the design is poor in my opinion. The food is getting limited due to its cost cutting and some of the food is not good as well. The entertainment is maybe the only good thing I may expect from Etihad and that is all. Abu Dhabi Airport is seriously awful and  the terminal is outdated, the toilets is limited, the security agents is rude and the lounge and other facilities from Etihad is awful. Return flight was awful. The seats is same on the A380, pretty uncomfortable and pretty small. The food for dinner had run out of everything and I got only 1 choice left when they got to my seat which I am disappointed with this. Although, I still like the way the staff talk and show respect to customers and apologize to me about the run out food. The transit in Abu Dhabi Airport was a disaster even for the return trip and the lounge of Etihad is still poor. The flight back to Jakarta on the A330 is more uncomfortable and one of my seats screen and charging pod is broken and no one will help me at all. But the food is still better than the Paris-Abu Dhabi route which they don’t run out at least. In conclusion, Etihad is no longer as a full service and more like a budget airline. This is my first and truly the last time flying with Etihad and I will never fly this airline again. Their service needs some serious fix and improvement and I cannot believe that even USA airlines and even Budget airlines are even better than Etihad. Also, the WIFI is also expensive than most major airlines as well which is another disappointment as well.

### "comfortable enough"
London Heathrow to Jakarta via Abu Dhabi. LHR - Abu Dhabi leg - There was quite a long queue at check-in at LHR but fast track security was very quick and the lounge in T4 is very pleasant with good food offerings. Boarding was efficient and the crew were friendly enough. Seat and IFE were fine and I liked the Acqua di Parma amenity bag - my only real complaint was the food service - I'd eaten in the lounge so just had a snack on board before sleeping and was expecting a proper breakfast service in the morning before arrival. In fact, nothing at all was offered, not a hot towel, not a cup of tea, nothing. If they'd explained the system better I could have ordered something for the morning before sleeping but it was too late by the time I realised. Arrived at Abu Dhabi feeling very hungry. Abu Dhabi airport is old especially T1 and the security staff, even at the fast track lane were extremely unfriendly. The lounge was OK except for scalding myself in the showers because the water was so ridiculously hot. I complained but the shower attendant was quite rude and suggested that I didn't know how to regulate the temperature! I then complained to the front desk and they were apologetic - I noticed that 5 minutes later the shower was closed and an engineer had been called! The Abu Dhabi - Jakarta leg was uneventful and the food offerings were decent. Overall, it was OK - all flights were more or less on time and the seat (same seat type on both aircraft) was comfortable enough. I got a good deal on the ticket (purchased about 6 months in advance) so I can't complain really.

### "a genuine improvement happening"
Etihad have been receiving some very negative feedback over the past two years and in many cases it is in my view deserved. The severe cost cutting which has been the strategy of the new CEO is in my view short sighted and has done sever damage to what was an excellent brand of Quality. Slashing costs to severe the Billions in losses which were in fact due to bad investments by their previous CEO and not so on the operational side. In any case having been a Etihad guest for now 11 years and being gold for many of them I have witnessed first hand the demoralised crews, the slashing of extras and a general demise. But of late (6 months) having taken 8 long haul flights in business, one can see a genuine improvement happening. The cabin crew I have always felt were exceptional to most other airlines , engaging , naturally friendly and with a can do attitude. The ground crew still need some serious investment in how to be pleasant and value customer support. Recent flights - all on time, great improvement on IFE, menus have improved, staff are very engaging and if there is an issue it is actually followed up on. My lack of faith with them is slowly being restored.

### "truly LCC style"
Paris to Johannesburg via Abu DhabiOnline Checkin is comfortable, but seat pre-assignment is unnerving. A380 has a weird interior design, looks like 80s to me. Double-Screen-IFE is an interesting touch, but practically useless. Seat medium comfortable, too hard for me. Variable lumbar support in the seat is a nice touch, but practically useless. Food was all gone but Veg when it was our turn. The crew was talking and cackling so loudly behind the curtain, I heard it through my Noise Cancelling Headphones. IFE had a good selection of movies, many of them in German. Advertisements for paid snack menu were absolutely unnerving and truly LCC style.

### "Will never fly them again"
London to Chennai via Abu Dhabi. From London to Abu Dhabi service is great. But Abu Dhabi is Chennai you feel like you were in a cattle class; food is rubbish, no entertainment facilities; very old aircraft, you just sit idle for 4 hours. Will never fly them again.

### "Shocking behavior by cabin staff"
Overall summary: 1) Terrible cabin service especially on Abu Dhabi-Belgrade sector cabin service ignored passenger safety (details below). Cabin service on Kochi-Abu Dhabi and Belgrade-Zurich medicore. 2) Ground support at Abu Dhabi terrible. 3) Food lousy. 4) Outbound trip on Etihad - Zurich - Abu Dhabi cabin crew rude and unhelpful. Food lousy. Details: 1) Airline landed in Belgrade and was still taxiing. Passengers were opening overhead compartments, pulled out luggage and left on aisle, leaving door open. Many of them were standing on the aisle while the crew hardly bothered to stop them. They were busy talking to one another. Shocking behavior by cabin staff. Additional hospitality notes: None of the cabin staff could barely crack a smile - perhaps they were afraid their make up would crack up or a few teeth might fall off? 2) 1h connection at Abu Dhabi to catch flight to Belgrade. Huge queues at airport to clear security and to get to gate which was very far. No ground staff to assist getting through security. Some of us shouted for help before someone came to lead us through to the front of queue. But still we had to run (2 little kids + 2 adults) to make it to the gate (had to reach gate 41 from gate 57 or so). Imagine the plight of elderly or those with kids? 3) I ordered Asian vegetarian. Food was under-cooked, unpalatable, devoid of any thought into what was thrown in. Even a roadside shop in any Asian country will give you far better and tastier food. Simply unacceptable. 4) Outbound trip on Dec. 15 Zurich-Abu Dhabi - Cabin staff were rude! When we asked for water they took a very long time to assist. There was no smile, warmth or a sense of hospitality. Food was as bad as explained in (3) - identical food. Overall - terrible airline to fly. Unless one is interested in cheap tickets I would not fly this airline. I would also not transit through Belgrade airport. The transit desk in Belgrade (Air Serbia operates on behalf of Etihad from Belgrade-Zurich) is under trained. They could not understand that our residence card for Switzerland was equivalent of a visa and held us for over 30 minutes, until a very senior supervisor had to come and explain to them. None of the transit desk staff knew what the card meant, whereas every other major European city knows exactly what it is.

### "Lost baggage in the transfer"
London to Melbourne via Abu Dhabi. Worst airline ever. Lost baggage in the transfer. They could not tell me where the baggage was, or whether it had arrived at the stopover in Abu Dhabi. In addition, the airport was a poor excuse for an airport. Security Baggage checks involved hordes of people being herded through a large hallway with no clear lines or queues, no signs and very poor instructions.

### "very poor customer service"
Riyadh to London via Abu Dhabi. The arriving flight into Riyadh was late so my flight to Abu Dhabi was late getting in, as I only had 1 hour to transfer to the next flight they automatically booked me onto the next flight which was 6 hours later, even though I had 35 minutes before my flight was scheduled to leave. No apology was given, a ticket was thrust into my hand and they just walked off, rude and very poor customer service. Registered a complaint which was finally answered but all I received was a statement of fact that the flight was delayed so I was booked on another flight, no heartfelt apology again just poor customer service. I’m just waiting for my return flight and I’m not expecting this to be any different. Avoid this airline like the plague, if enough people report their bad service then maybe they will do something about it but I doubt it.

### "I would not travel Etihad again"
Not Verified |  New York to Bangalore via Abu Dhabi. Had a delayed flight and encountered chaos at Abu Dhabi airport. Etihad tried to put passengers on a flight 24 hours later when there was an earlier flight available with empty seats. Also was forced to pay for visa fees at Abu Dhabi and transportation charges to city and back for delay caused by Etihad. Customer support on the phone provide incorrect information; also they ask you to go log any complaints on their website instead of attending to those themselves. Complaints logged at the website end up in a black hole - expect no response, forget about a resolution. if you miss a Etihad connecting flight at Abu Dhabi airport because your incoming Etihad flight was late, BE PREPARED TO BEAR THE EXPENSES. I would not travel Etihad again.

### "customer care is a disaster"
Abu Dhabi to Paris. This flight was again a big fail. The airport was really busy and took me more than 35 mns to be able to reach the check in counter. I had to repack my bag for 800 gr extra. I was threaten to pay a full kilo for about $25. I understand that we have to follow the bag allowance but for less a kilo I found it miserable to ask people to do so. I also didn't have with me any hand luggage. After boarding, one crew wanted me to move from my aisle seat to seat in a middle seat to allowed a couple to seat together. For a family with kids, I would had made it but not for adults. When I explain to her that I choose this seat explicit to use the toilets freely she just left by saying "Never mind that is not nice". I realize later during the flight that she was friend with the passengers. Food was less than average and my choice was not available. Could not eat the main course which was too spicy and soggy. Never mind I had my dinner before the flight. I found my suit case dented after 45 mns of waiting at the carousel. When I approached a staff he just answered me that was maybe due of high amount of luggage that they were treating daily. I didn't argue with him and just left to end this horrible trip. To conclude, customer care is a disaster and can only advise people to avoid Etihad as flights are not that cheap.

### "worst flight I have experienced"
Manchester to Bangkok via Abu Dhabi. Absolutely horrendous flight from Manchester to Abu Dhabi. No announcements of boarding. The flight was too hot no aircon insufferable heat. The interior smelled insufferable. Always run out of food choice .. bit of a oxymoron. The choice is this however we only have the pasta left. The transfer was abysmal. They had overbooked by 50 so plane had to be changed. No information was given just people queuing for hours to board. I will qualify my statements that I am a silver member and have been using etihad for over 15 years. This was the worst flight I have experienced in over 15 years. Their standards have dropped. I was sick for a week with flu on arrival.

### "money looting business trick"
Kuwait to Los Angeles via Abu Dhabi. I booked a ticket for my daughter’s study related travel via Etihad website on 17th November 2019 as per her US visa issued. At the counter, we found out a new name system (first name should be listed as the last name and FNU (first name unknown) in place of first name is issued after charging additional 33.5KD (100$) and we weren’t informed about it. They said it’s shown in the website but even they could not show us where it’s mentioned when we showed them the website at check in counter. Hence we had to pay 33.5kd extra to reissue a ticket in order to include FNU (correct a mistake) which wasn’t properly informed. I took a travel ticket for her in August 2019 via Etihad and there was no such problem. This is purely a money looting business trick by Etihad and no other Airline in Kuwait doing this illogical system. She faced some trouble at Abu Dhabi US Emigration (reissued ticket name (FNU) and US visa name not matching).

### "I would recommend Etihad"
Not Verified |  Brisbane to Munich via Abu Dhabi. Our flight was a night flight, with a flight time of 14 hours, meaning I was able to sleep for most of the time. Boarding was quick and efficient. Our legroom at Seat 34E was pretty good. I was able to put my backpack under the seat and still have room for my legs. After takeoff, service began with Dinner. My food was tasty. Shortly after dinner I was able to sleep for a full 7 hours on this flight. Service started again with breakfast. I just had some fruit. After landing in Abu Dhabi, the ground service was very helpful, and we were able to make our way to our next flight on time. AUH-MUC. After a quick 2 hour layover in Abu Dhabi, we boarded the 787-9 to Munich. I had a window seat with a spare seat next to me. The legroom was pretty good. I was still able to put my backpack under the seat and still have room for my legs. I was pretty satisfied with the amenities for the 6-hour flight ahead of us. After take-off, meal service began, handing out  breakfast/lunch. I had a dish with chicken and veggies. Very tasty! Inflight entertainment was pretty good. I watched The Secret Life of Pets 2 and some sitcoms. The flight was very quick and had great service onboard. Overall, I would recommend Etihad to friends and family.

### "stay well away from this airline"
False advertising, we paid extra for leg room so our 3 year old wouldn't struggle, only to find the seats were of no use to us and the flight was half full, having been told it was a full flight. Purchased the tickets and we was told it as Australian Dollars only to find out it was USD so more expensive for us. Very poorly managed on the flight could quite easily given us an upgrade, we did not use the seats payed for seating not used. Emailed several; times and have had no response, their customer service is non existent, stay well away from this airline.

### "felt welcomed onboard"
Sydney to Beirut via Abu Dhabi. Staff are  respectful, felt welcomed onboard and i was taken care of. Inflight entertainment was great. Food was delicious. Leg room and seat comfort was amazing. Baggage allowance is great. I highly recommend this airline.

### "just an average flight"
Abu Dhabi - Melbourne on a Boeing 787 and was nice to travel this route on a modern plane with modern seat etc than the tired old 777 that had been used earlier in the year on the same route I have travelled. The IFE seemed to have improved as more modern films were available which was a plus point on a flight of 13hrs plus. The food choices seems to have been cut back and was a struggle to have the eat at anytime during the flight when traveling business class. The crew seemed to be very new and one of the few crews that never addressed you by your name which is common when traveling business or you are a valued frequent flyer, flight left as usual near 30mins late which needs to be improved but the flight did arrive 15mins early so kind of evens things out. All in all, just an average flight with this airline that gets you from A to B at the end of the day.

### "found Etihad to be mediocre at best"
I'll start off by saying that I can't really complain as I was paying a mere US$760 to travel halfway around the world to Madrid and back during the super peak period of the UEFA Chanpions League Final. That being said, I found Etihad to be mediocre at best. At least they were fairly on time and make an effort to be. I found that the seat pitch at 30 inches meant that legroom was compromised. That extra 1 inch makes a lot of difference, and I found the offerings on competitors to be at least decent at 31-32 inches, which is perhaps more ideal for long-haul flights. I would be referring to competitors like Qatar, Emirates, Turkish, Finnair etc. They also seemed stingy with the food & beverage & snack service as others have mentioned - hence I wouldn't elaborate. What really irritated me more is that the dhow-shaped tray that the food was served on has absolutely zero purpose other than aesthetics and it kept slipping down my tray table. Super irritating. Many passengers were also irked that the IFE system (specifically the movies & TV) is turned on only after the main ascent & will be shut down before the main descent. That's an hour of IFE gone. Passengers are still able to browse through connecting flight details or view the overhead plane cameras. I travelled only with hand luggage and hence I had no problems or negative experiences with ground luggage handling. But the standard 23kg was offered. As 95% of passengers would only be passing through Abu Dhabi, it is also worthwhile to note that connecting flights are fairly seamless and security probably wouldn't take more than 10-15 mins or so. At this price point (below US$800 for a transcontinental flight) I certainly wouldn't mind flying with them again. I wouldn't be terribly excited about it though.

### "not comfortable trip"
Not Verified |  Sydney to Medinah via Abu Dhabi. This was my first flight with Etihad Airways and this will be my last time. Didn’t like it at all, my back harts me from the seats not comfortable trip at all. I don’t recommend this Airways even for trip for two hours.

### "a little bit disappointed"
Brisbane to London via Abu Dhabi. I’ve flown with Etihad a few times by now, since I moved to Australia a few years ago. Since then, long flights are part of my life. Just came back to Portugal a few days ago, and for the first time brought a brand new surfboard that unfortunately arrived home in a really bad state. I know that bringing such delicate items on such a long trip it’s a risk but when you want to travel with your personal items you got to trust that the people taking care of your trip will take that also serious. I’ve paid a lot for my board to fly over and I’ll probably have to pay even more to fix it. Overall the flights were  alright and pleasant but this time I’m just a little bit disappointed.

### "a good average one"
Melbourne to Abu Dhabi. As this flight was a code-share flight , we were unable to check in online for our flight, nor could we select our seats. Luckily our seats were in a good position on the aircraft. The check in process at Melbourne airport was slow, notwithstanding we were at the airport just under 3 hours before our flight departure time. The boarding process for the aircraft was a lot better. The economy seat on this aircraft was no better or worse than other airlines - very little leg room if you are a tall person, meaning it is almost impossible to get any sleep on long haul flights. Cabin staff were "professional" and obliging, if not in an overly friendly way. Flight entertainment was quite good with sufficient content to keep you entertained. The in-seat screen appeared to be bigger than the average, which was very good. The meal service was good. The standard of the food was also mostly good. The only beef I have about the meal service (and I have experienced this before on Etihad) is that the moment the seat belt sign comes on, for even minor disturbances, the meal service is suspended. The end result is that the meal service runs on forever and when you have finished your meal, the meal tray is left on your tray table for a very long time - again, mainly due to the disruptions to the service. My wife ended up getting up and taking her used tray to the flight crew's galley, who were mostly standing around chatting. On other airlines, flight service continues unless the Captain instructs flight attendant to be seated. The flight departed on time and arrived on time. Overall I would classify this flight/airline as a good average one. Nothing outstanding, but nothing terrible either.

### "no air-conditioning"
Abu Dhabi to Bangalore. I flew in an aircraft with no air-conditioning and felt suffocated. It’s not worth paying for my travel and no compensation after emailing them the trouble I and other passengers faced, even the crew were sweating due to no AC. It’s the worst aircraft I have ever flown. Will never fly back with them again. They charged my credit card twice and no refund is given back it’s been 15 days now

### "decent flights in both cases"
Melbourne to London via Abu Dhabi. Perfectly decent flights in both cases, had a neighbour free seat which is invaluable for long haul so was able to sleep comfortably for long periods. Food of decent quality, one issue is that the cabin crew will wake you up for meals rather than giving you the option to sleep through in the case of a night flight which would be preferable. Pricing is a major gripe for Etihad, if one wants an Economy Space seat the price varies on the type of aircraft with it costing $150 extra until day of travel where it can be as inexpensive as $50. The differential of Economy Space between Abu Dhabi and Sydney and Melbourne to Abu Dhabi was nearly 30%. Irrespective, staff were helpful and polite, flights were more or less on time without any event. Boarding process smooth and overall an enjoyable flying experience.

### "Staff were pleasant and attentive"
London to Sydney via Abu Dhabi. Etihad doesn't boast a true Premium Economy, they have Economy Space which are seats with extra legroom - sometimes with a dedicated cabin or are just bulkhead/emergency exit seats. I was provided with the seat to Abu Dhabi for free (as it was a middle seat) and paid for Abu Dhabi to Sydney. The seat on the Abu Dhabi flight was exceptionally comfortable and I was able to get some sleep even in spite of it being a middle seat. The Sydney seat being in the emergency row meant one could not sprawl out across the seats even though the neighbouring seat was vacant. For Etihad a neighbour free seat is more optimal than an emergency seat in my view. The food offering as a Gluten Free passenger is decent, one gets served first and the food is very good although the bread is a bit flavourless. I had two meals LHR-AUH and three meals AUH-SYD could not complain about any of these. Staff on board were pleasant and attentive. One gripe is that the seat belt sign seems to get left on even when there is no turbulence. It should be noted that the snack offering unlike other airlines is available for a fee between meals so if you get peckish I would advise you to bring your own. Not much of a person for AVOD so presume to be satisfactory.

### "a company I would not recommend"
Abu Dhabi to New Delhi. I am a frequent flyer and it was my second journey with Etihad. Unfortunately it is a company I would not recommend: I've booked a driver to get to the airport, I spent 45' on the phone with the useless customer service just to be able to gte in touch with the driver that was just nearby but couldn't contact me. I almost lost my flight. During the flight in Business class nothing was provided in term of pochette, as well as no form for the custom service. On the same reservation I've tried several time to change my return ticket but: It is impossible to do it online (the site doens't even give the option). I spent at least 3 hours at the phone in different moment to try to get in contact with someone able to manage the request. I I just had "We will call you back" promise, that it was never confirmed. Considering that I was a Business customer I think that a bit more of accuracy and post service support shall be provided.

### "cabin crew was rarely in evidence"
Frankfurt to Manila via Abu Dhabi. The flight from Europe: newer aircraft more space better entertainment better food - the seat belt sign was not on for extended periods. To Manila The seat belt sign was on for more than half of the flight and there was little turbulence. The cabin crew was rarely in evidence. Eventually everyone ignored the signs as they needed the toilets.

### "have rejected the claim"
I flew Etihad from Rome to Sydney via Abu Dhabi in October. Food and service from Rome to Abu Dhabi was reasonable. Food and service from Abu Dhabi to Sydney was awful. On arrival I discovered a 5 cm tear on the back of checked luggage. I made a claim for reimbursement and provided all required supporting documentation - tickets, boarding pass, luggage tags etc etc. Etihad have rejected the claim as I submitted one day late based on the rules that you must submit within 7 days of arrival. Escalations to senior management met with no response.

### "our experience was great"
London to Abu Dhabi. I was a bit worried after the negative reviews, our experience was great: comfortable enough seats, tasty meals, very friendly and helpful staff. Big and bright new screens with a good selection of movies. Will travel with you again

### "Cabin crew welcome us"
Melbourne to Abu Dhabi. Check in process easy and fast. Boarding was smooth. Cabin crew welcome us, and checking passenger. FA was attentive and seen helping mother and playing with child. One FA from Armenia was very caring and smiling. Food quality was average, IFE was below average in selection. Toilet is clean. On arrival to AUH line of worker with wheelchairs waiting to pick up disabled passengers.

### "It's a dreadful service"
This was the second set of business class flights for a family from London to Abu Dhabi with Etihad in 6 months. When we boarded my seat felt like it was textile on a hard board underneath and an engineer was called to "re-inflate it". He then re set the whole business class pod and left. After 15 minutes it was clear that he had also reset the IFE system which wouldn't re start. As a result I couldn't see the pre flight safety demo video and asked the cabin crew if they could fix it. I was told for the next two hours that they were re setting it but it never was re set and after about 3 hours I was given what looked like a small Ipad mini which was impossible to watch. During all this the seat deflated again, leaving me with a seat that felt like sitting on a hard board and after a bit of poking the cabin crew said we can't fix it and gave me a couple of cushions to sit on for the remaining 4.5 hours of the flight, which of course meant that it was impossible to use the flat bed to sleep on. To cap it all, on arrival at AUH, our bags which were marked "Priority" because of our business class ticket, were virtually the last to come off the belt. Whilst trying to get some sort of fix done, the cabin crew made me feel that I was an annoyance to them and they would prefer to chat in the galley. It's a dreadful service for a full fare business class ticket. Book any other airline than Etihad to AUH, especially for business class

### "nasty, unpleasant humiliating experience"
Abu Dhabi to Manchester. Publicly humiliated! Reserved extra legroom seat for extra £58. Denied access and told after length wait with queues building up behind me that I wasn’t fit to sit in this door seat (I am a very healthy 72 year old golf and table tennis player, keen walker, never been in hospital, full medical insurance with no conditions etc). No refund for £58 seat. Offered upgrade to business at Full ticket cost! Also food atrocious. The plane into Abu Dhabi parked well away from Terminal as no air bridge. In the Abu Dhabi heat crammed into bus. A nasty, unpleasant humiliating experience. Etihad are cheap but as a regular long haul passenger go for the quality airlines, Cathay, BA and Emirates. Etihad is cheap for a reason- read all the other poor reviews.

### "replay was so humiliating"
Not Verified | I had a ticket from Belgrade to Tokyo for me and my daughter. On our way back from Tokyo to Belgrade via Abu Dhabi, I had to pay 10 Euro extra if I wanted to sit with my child together. I was almost the first to check-in online. In that moment, the plane was almost empty, all seats available. I perfectly understand that when you buy economy seat tickets has no right to choose seat, but it is normal to sit together with a member of your family if you buy tickets together and check-in together. I wrote a letter to Etihad before I get into the plane, soon after I paid this 10 Euro. Their replay was so humiliating. The replay was that they will have this example for future training. What training and to whom? I paid my tickets 1500 Euro, 10 Euro more or less make no difference, but to have such a stress 24h before my flight because I can not sit with my child - disappointing. Cheap way to make extra more money even if it is just 10 Euro. Of course, other people were sitting together on the plane with their family of friends with no extra payment. Even if is a problem of the system, nice apology with the letter and money back would be just nice and OK. Problems might not have happened. Nothing

### "My luggage was destroyed"
Melbourne to Athens via Abu Dhabi. Etihad has the worst service. My luggage was destroyed on a flight and when I spoke to client services at Etihad, it took them 6 weeks to respond and the response was nothing short of terrible. In addition to this, we were delayed for 6 hours, our baby struggled throughout entire flight as we repeatedly asked for warm water for her formula and They kept ignoring us. I strongly recommend not flying with this airline, they are terrible.

### "they didn’t say sorry"
Paris to Singapore via Abu Dhabi with my wife on 26th October 2019. We came to check in desk in the airport around 8AM for bags drop-off and were told that we can’t fly cause we need a Singapore visa. We’re citizens of Ukraine and allowed a transit entry to Singapore for 96 hours in case we have further flight to 3rd country and have reservation of the hotel in Singapore. I explained the rule, provided print outs of boarding passes from Singapore to Bali that was to happen within 48 hours and a confirmation of pre-paid hotel in Singapore for 2 nights that allowed us visa-free entry to the country (following the immigration rule of Singapore). The lady at the check-in insisted that we can’t be boarded cause we need a visa. We travel a lot and I’m always well prepared and had print outs from official immigration site of Singapore stating that we’re allowed to get 96 hours transit entry visa to Singapore following the above criteria. They didn’t want to look at the prints and also refused to check the rule on the official Singapore immigration web site. She also said that if it’s true, we might be allowed a 96 hours transit visa to stay in the airport but not to enter the country. I tried to explain that visa is not required to stay in the airport but didn’t work. She called a manager who tried to get rid of us saying that we can’t go to Singapore without visa. They didn’t listen to us and didn’t even try to check our eligibility to enter Singapore. I was 100% sure that they’re making a mistake cause I checked it many times as well as a lot of our friends visited Singapore without visa this way. So in the end I asked the manager to give a written confirmation that they rejected our boarding (I didn’t plan to lose several thousand euros because of incompetence of the staff so was planning to claim all expenses back, of course). Only after this she just shouted on us to wait and went somewhere. In about 20 minutes she came back and said that we will be boarded. No excuses, they didn’t say sorry and just said that normally we’re not allowed to enter Singapore without visa but they will make an exception for us. We arrived to Singapore and no questions from officers.

### "seem to have upped their game"
Melbourne to Manchester via Abu Dhabi. I was more impressed with them this time around than last. They do seem to have upped their game in terms of service. It’s more welcoming and personal. Seats when flat aren’t massively comfortable and a mattress protector should be a default. Food I think was better as well. Menu always has light dining options which is really needed. They are let down though by AD airport. 3 of my 4 flights departed or arrived from a remote gate and on 3 of the 4 occasions, there was no priority screening so all that added time. Minor inconvenience but an improvement here would be good. Being a VA platinum flyer means I can access the first-class lounge on AD which is a huge bonus. Nice and quiet.

### "Etihad on the avoid list"
I flew with Etihad from Amman to Chicago via Abu Dhabi, and then from Chicago to Amman same route. The staff on the aircraft were professional and good, however, I had to go through one of the worst experiences I had. On my way back to Amman, I flew from Chicago with two carry on bags, I arrived Abu Dhabi at night went to my hotel, then on the next day I went to the airport, and there was an employee stopping people asking to weigh their carry ons, I told her that I'm just transiting here, she insisted to check the weights then she told me that I have to get rid of the excess weight or check in my bags. I went back to the check in counter who told me that I have to pay $300 for the extra 3 kg or throw them, noting that if it was the case from Chicago I would pay 40-50 dollars. I refused to pay half of my ticket for that little weight, but unfortunately I had to throw some of my stuff. the Etihad employee who were standing was very rude and unprofessional acted in a way that I was begging her. I raised a complaint to Etihad, who replied that they are sorry! so I think that Etihad will be on the avoid list whenever I'm traveling.

### "Never flying with them again"
Flew Sydney to Rome via Melbourne and Abu Dhabi. Disappointing! I was expecting a four star airline but got maybe 2. The only positive thing I have to say is that the flights were generally all on time. Negatives: Seats were cramped - one Rome to Abu Dhabi leg was on an ancient 777 with a broken screen and crappy display, I could barely watch anything. My partners seat couldn't recline on the Melbourne - Abu Dhabi leg. But he big thing that stuck out to me was the lack of food and the poor quality of the food itself. We requested special meals and were starving for most of our flights.. On a 13 hour flight, we were served twice, with a small snack in between. The normal portions of food for everyone else were quite small, but our special meals were even smaller if you can believe that. Our meals consisted of some baby portion of a tomato-based dish (every single flight had a very similar tomato dish), a bread roll, margarine, and maybe a cup of fruit or a fruit bar. The snack was a wrap, and a small packet of sultanas, whilst everyone else got a wrap and a brownie. Then when they were serving drinks, I asked the flight attendant if they had soy milk for coffee/tea and she just scoffed at me, as if that was such a huge request! She made me feel like I shouldn't have even bothered asking. If they can cater special meals, they should be able to cater for people who are allergic to dairy or are lactose intolerant. but whatever. Never flying with them again. Also my brand new luggage came back so scuffed up, it was crazy.

### "meals were barely enough"
Not Verified | Manchester to Ahmedabad via Abu Dhabi. EY16, it was ok, however they had moved the check-in desks and we were ill-informed about it. Anyway, when it came to meal time, the meals we had were barely enough. They gave some snacks and then we landed in Abu Dhabi. What also concerned me was that there were only one set of stairs to offload the passengers from a Boeing 787-10. I guess that's really the airports experience. EY288, the worlds worst experience. So, when boarding, we went right to the back. Now, there was a problem. My seat was broken. Fully broken. They said it was nothing but contacted the technical crew "Just for our satisfaction". They replaced the seat, I snapped a few photos. Suddenly 3 cabin crew came up and said in a threatening tone "delete the photos. They said it was illegal for photos to have people's faces in. That was not clearly visible. The flight took off at 12am, 55mins late. They have cramped the already cramped seats!

### "Never taking this airline again2
Washington to Lagos via Abu Dhabi. In my time of travels, this is the worst airline ever. My baggage allowance was 2pcs of 23Kg. 1st bag 22.6kg and 2nd bag was 24kg. They forced me to pay for extra luggage or take out 1kilo. My carry on was 9kg instead of 7kg. Again I was forced to remove one of my MacBook Pro. I paid for extra legroom online and she insisted on seeing the receipt before she can print my ticket. I have paid for my seat several days prior and selected my seat, their computer reflects this, I don’t know why she wanted to see my receipt. Inside the plane, poor seniors that couldn’t located their seats were not helped by the air hostesses. 14 hour flight and they serve the same food twice. I have high hopes for Etihad Airways but a very big letdown. Never taking this airline again.

### "cabin staff was quite good"
Brisbane to Frankfurt via Abu Dhabi. I was very pleased with my onboard experience in Business and Economy class. Boarding, Food, Seats and Entertainment was up to standard. The cabin staff was quite good, efficient and friendly. The airport (departure and transfer) experience was less enjoyable (Abu Dhabi Airport needs to improve their transfer service). The lounge in Abu Dhabi is alright though, their contracted lounges in Australia (not in Sydney) and Europe are poor.

### "definitively fly again"
Not Verified |  Abu Dhabi to Munich. Etihad thanks for the service. Staff at check in at airport very friendly and fast and efficient. Flight on time. seats comfortable and food was nice and vegetarian menu on pre booking brought to seat. Entertainment in different languages and seating comfort very good. Stewardess did walk several times to bring drinks and snack with a smile. Will definitively fly again.

### "little overweight in each bag"
Chicago to Ahmedabad via Abu Dhabi. One of the worst service out of all airlines. We will never fly this airlines again. Staff couldn’t put my family together in the flight. She was very rude. She doesn’t know any customer service. Also our luggage was little overweight in each bag and because if that we had to pay $120. TWhich airlines charges $120 for few lbs?? Usually rest of the airlines charges $50 extra for 32 kg instead of 23 kg.

### "Food was indescribably poor"
Horrible flight from Abu Dhabi to New York. Staff have no respect for customers what-so-ever and one of them not only was arguing with the customer in front of other passengers but carried on talking about the customer for another 20-30 minutes. Food was indescribably poor. Then there was that appalling sandwich and desert combo branded “The Good Life” that is given to passengers on shorter flights which I could not stomach. On the return flight, I ensured that I bought good snacks from JFK Int’l Airport so as not to starve during the flight.

### "never flying again"
Sydney to London via Abu Dabhi. Asked for a chicken meal but was told it ran out, I don’t do beef and veg meal was pathetic. No hot towels, no toiletries. Seriously 15-hour flight and had to stand 1 hour inside the plane after landing in Abu Dabhi due to security reason. Poor airline so far. Disgusting food and beverage service - never flying again.

### "Etihad seems to ignore passenger feedback"
Melbourne to Abu Dhabi. This was the same tired old plane that I flew near 3 weeks prior & this route should at least have a modern plane with a much newer upgraded cabin across all classes. What was a surprise that Business class was just over a third full which meant we got served a lot more quickly with meals snacks etc., but the whole interior, old seat, IFE particular the old Blurry screen was very depressing. The seat does turn into a flat bed but it’s just so uncomfortable because it’s old & has been well used. Crew on this flight were more attentive due in part to the empty cabin & everything done was very efficient & they were always on hand to your needs. This route badly needs a new plane or at least go back to the impressive Boeing 787 as that cabin is very passenger friendly. But Etihad sadly seems to ignore passenger feedback especially the frequent flyers who are either Gold or Platinum members ... which is sad.

### "I would never fly Etihad again"
Not Verified |  London to Sydney via Abu Dhabi. Although the staff were lovely, I would never fly Etihad again. Not only did they have no air con on the plane while sitting in the tarmac for almost an hour, but I was bumped from my flight from Abu Dhabi to Sydney because they overbooked by 18 people. They put me up in a cheap hotel for the 12 hour wait until my next flight and gave me a cash refundable voucher which I could claim in the airport. Not only could I not claim this refund in the airport, but it has been almost three months since I submitted for the refund and I am yet to receive it. Etihad May be cheap, but they need to do better. Honour your promises and stop overbooking by such a large amount.

### "will never fly Etihad again"
Rome to Mumbai via Abu Dhabi. Do not fall for their free stopover holiday (available only on direct bookings at a higher cost) scam. I had a confirmed Rome to Mumbai ticket with a 48 stopover holiday hotel booked in Abu Dhabi. I uploaded all documentation required for an e-visa via a link provided by Etihad. This was done with plenty of time in hand. My application was sent successfully. However when I did receive any email regarding the visa I emailed them again and this was about 14 emails in 3 days, requesting them to advise me what to do. I got a reply asking me for my 1) Type of passport and country of issue 2) My ticket copy. I provided both and asked them once again if any further details were required, The airline did not bother to reply. By this time I was frantic. It was the last leg of my 2.5 week Europe vacation. I did not have international roaming on my cell and could only reach them via email. My last email to them stated that in case the e-visa has not been issued then I should not be charged for the "Free" Stopover hotel (condition attached was a 100% charge for which my cc was authorised for a no show which is what I would be if I did not have a visa ). I had an onward flight back home with about 48-50 hours in Abu Dhabi (and I was ok not exiting the airport in that case). However, the check in staff at Rome FCO denied me boarding unless I showed proof of immediate onward boarding (with less than 8 hours transit between flights and it had to be on Etihad so that it reflected on their system). So I had to purchase a fresh ticket while at FCO in order to be able to board the flight from Rome. The check in crew in Rome was Alitalia and they tried to help me. They called Abu Dhabi 5 times but no one in Etihad Abu Dhabi seemed interested. The Alitalia team was as shocked as me. I barely made it to my flight from Rome to Abu dhabi with fast track immigration. No chance to use a lounge or even look at duty free or even grab a bottle of water. The aircraft was decent, the crew poorly behaved and busy chatting, the poorest meal but I ate it simply out of hunger. On arrival in Abu Dhabi, I contacted their supervisor, who was gracious and stunned at the harassment I had gone through. She offered to get me a visa within an hour however I was in no mood to visit Abu Dhabi or avail their free stopover. She then advised me to write an email stating what had transpired and that Etihad would take note. All I wanted was a refund for the fresh ticket I had to book for a sector for which I already had a ticket. She said it would be done. I used the lounge to rest and eat as I had a few hours before my next flight. I wrote Etihad emails while still at the lounge in Abu Dhabi and mind you, the email content advised by their supervisor. The response so far - we are looking into your complaint/feedback. The plane for Abu Dhabi to Mumbai seemed like it had been retrieved from a junkyard. I will never fly Etihad again and I doubt they will issue me a refund for the ticket I was forced to buy. Highly disappointed

### "they don't seem to care"
Shanghai to Abu Dhabi via Rome with Etihad Airways. This was a bad flight. Very uncomfortable, even though I paid for extra leg room. Food was horrible. I contacted their customer service, but they don't seem to care.

### "I highly recommend"
Melbourne to Abu Dhabi. My experience was a total knock out. Incredible staff that offered water and snacks on our 14 hour flight to Abu Dhabi. Meals were sufficient in portion. Inflight entertainment was excellent in terms of content but the UX needed some improvement. I highly recommend flying Etihad.

### "worst flight experience"
Dear Etihad, don’t know where to begin. I had 2 weeks trip to attend my sister wedding from Washington DC to Hyderabad via Abu Dhabi. Everything about my one-way trip so far was horrible and I’m freaking out. My baggage was delayed on my arrival to Hyderabad and when I went for the counter they didn’t even trace my baggage after 3 days. Food served was horrible - dinner and breakfast. And dinner comes after 3 hours after our departure time. The worst flight experience I had truly.

### "meals served were horrible"
Not Verified |  Toronto to Delhi return via Abu Dhabi. Booked vegetarian and all the meals served were horrible. Does somebody eat these food items before giving to the passengers. I saw a steward eating cheap noodle packet with hot water, perhaps she knew the quality of Etihad's food. our food came at different time or one was served earlier and other one was not served or took an half an hour delay. When told the steward, she was rude. Air condition in the the cabin was too cold and I saw a lot of passengers were shivering. Movies quit several times as the systems had to boot. Seats were old.

### "Ryanair without the discounted price"
Colombo to London via Abu Dhabi. Like Ryanair without the discounted price. Constantly trying to upsell. Charges for seats on both legs of flight. Uncomfortable seating London to Abu Dhabi, hard like bus seats. Nothing prepared me for AUH to CMB flights and return though-Bring Your Own phone and headphones, holder on seat back instead of a screen. No Tv, narrow cramped seats on 4 hour plus flight. Thought this was a top airline, couldn’t have been more wrong. Staff were pleasant and food ok but this is irrelevant when you are so uncomfortable. Will never fly with this airline again.

### "wanted to hand carry my guitar"
Manila to Brussels via Abu Dhabi. I wanted to hand carry my guitar but upon check in in Manila, I was told that they cannot allow me to hand carry it. I was surprised because during my flight from Brussels to Manila, there were 2 people in my flight from Brussels to Abu Dhabi who had their guitars in the cabin, meaning, they were allowed to hand carry them. One of them even flew to Manila as well. I have expressed my worry for the risk of damage because I have not packed the guitar in a hard case since it was foreseen for hand carry, I had it in a light soft case. The ground personnel attending to me explained that there was no risk to worry about as guitars and other musical instruments are not treated like luggages but are taken separately along with the fragile objects. I trusted the Etihad personnel and check it in. At the Brussels airport luggage claim, I waited at the off size or special luggages section thinking that it must have been treated as a fragile item as promised. But to my shock, I saw my guitar along the other luggages in the carousel. From the state of the case which was torn and the guitar's machine head obviously detached even before I opened the case, I knew my guitar was not handled well contrary to the promise. I filed a complaint at the section of the luggage claim area for lost/damaged items (this section represented all the accredited airlines). The person who attended to me acknowledged the damage and asked me to fill in a form. But upon calling the personnel of Etihad, he told me that the TAG that was put in my guitar was "a Limited liability tag" which means Etihad will not accept any claim. This was not explained to me in the Manila check in counter. When I went to the Etihad Personnel at the departure area, I was treated like a disturbance. Adamant to file my case, I was instead told that I should have reported it at the baggage claim area. When I told them I did, they said, there was nothing they can do. The ground stewardess in Manila made a mistake, but I cannot file an official complaint through them. They are not allowed to accept the claim. I was asked to provide a feedback on their website because they do not take responsibility for what happened.

### "Middle East's budget airline!"
Melbourne to Amsterdam via Abu Dhabi. This is the most awful embarrassment for an airline I have experienced! The Middle East's budget airline! Everything it extra. The “free” stopover is a scam. I read the reviews and still booked and I will always regret that. Dirty aircraft, bad service, awful food, uncomfortable and rude.

### "rude customer representatives"
Chicago to Mumbai via Abu Dhabi. Terrible experience with the rude customer representatives at ORD. I have been using the same carry-on baggage for the last 5 years and never had a problem with any other airline. My itinerary was changed a month before my date of departure. I was originally planned to travel from ORD to PNQ, but Etihad changed my destination to Mumbai. And Etihad wasn't flexible while making this change. I would not recommend Etihad unless thats your only option.

### "we were seriously impressed"
I don't always bother to write reviews but or once I feel I should. I have read reviews for Etihad recently and was worried but we were really impressed. We flew Business class from London to Bangkok via Abu Dhabi. The London - Abu Dhabi segments were an A380 and the Abu Dhabi to Bkk was a 777 out and a Boeing 787 back. The lounge at Heathrow was small and okay. It would have been better had we not experienced the Qatar lounge but it was fine. The seat was great, with plenty of room and I loved the lighting in the cabin. Unlike other reviews, the staff were really good for all 4 segments. They were polite, addressed us by our names and nothing was too much trouble. They constantly came round the cabin replenishing drinks and checking if we needed anything. This was consistent from all staff. I am a nervous flyer and they went out of their way to make sure I was okay. Overall we were seriously impressed and felt that they deserve a decent review.

### "a tired old B777"
Abu Dhabi to Melbourne on a tired old B777 which was a shock as the last few flights I have flown was always on the modern 787 with a great new business class cabin seat etc originally when booking for this flight it was down on the website as a 787 but somewhere along the way was changed to a 777 which in itself is fine but what we actually got on the day was an old plane old cabin and old colors of the flag carrier. It seems Etihad don’t see Melbourne or Australia as a modern first-world country whose flights are always fully booked and Melbourne is a major tourist destination throughout the year. so it’s a bit of an insult when they use an old plane for this route. The seat was old and uncomfortable the IFE screen is the size of what you get on a modern economy cabin and just imagine in the business class cabin of 44 seats you get one toilet. That has to be unacceptable in business class that’s always full on this route! This flight, as usual, takes off late near to 45 mins later than it’s scheduled departure and as usual arrives late. Cabin crew were attentive on this flight and I did make conversation with the cabin manager and reference to why this route has gone back to a 777. Especially an old tired out 777 at that. So disappointing. Food on this flight was average and nothing to write home about. But this whole flight was let down by the use of an old 777 plane that needs retiring when compared to the modern 787 that was used on the last 4 flights that I have taken on this route previously. Etihad needs to step up this route with a modern aircraft

### "I slept extraordinarily well"
My expectations were low based on the horrendous Etihad reviews here. However I paid about 20% less than a Qatar/Qantas/Emirates fare and total journey time was a snip at about 21 hours so I thought I'd take the chance. Happily, I have no regrets and would do it again. Check in easy and swift at Melbourne. The Melbourne lounge is excellent and offered a la carte dining. On board 777 first leg, seat (6A) very comfortable, entertainment and booze excellent, food uneven but still enjoyable. Service excellent - attentive and warm without laying it on too thick. I slept 7 hours which I think is a record for me. AUH-FCO leg was on 787-10. Newer and slicker looking cabin, seat was just as comfortable (5A) and being daylight flight had great views through semi dimmed windows. Entertainment, service and catering were as before (however my lunch main was really good). Screen was bigger and sharper. One thing, the lounge in Abu Dhabi is pretty ordinary - Melbourne is much better and they weren't really set up well for showers and having a refresh. Etihad don't do pajamas or mattress toppers and don't call you by your name - none of which bothered me and I slept extraordinarily well.

### "it was nothing but poor"
Athens to Sydney via Abu Dhabi. This was a first time flying Etihad and it was nothing but poor. The service was bad, the flight attendants didn’t want to be there and were rude. Our check in bags also got destroyed. The food was bad and the the seats were dirty. We also had air con that leaked all over me and my partner and the CSM did nothing about it, even though we got drenched! We flew them to Europe and back and all 4 flights were bad! Never will I fly Etihad Airways again. I will give them a 3 out of 10 because the pilots were good.

### "overall I felt fleeced"
London to Sydney via Adu Dhabi return. Paid in advance some £160 to choose my seats over 3 of the 4 legs. On check in I was told that the seats I had selected and paid for were now not available, and that I had been relocated. When I asked for a refund I was told to call the helpdesk. Helpdesk informed me after 4 phone calls that even though I had paid for a service they could not deliver, there are No refunds. Complained in writing on return to UK. Etihad held their line, there are No refunds. Warning, take care if paying in advance to sit together, as Etihad will take your money, overbook the flight, and not refund you a penny when they cannot fulfill their side of the bargain. Generally the flight experience on Etihad was pretty poor. Surely and non engaging cabin crew, poor meals, no galley snacks except water, uncomfortable seats. They did take off and land within 30 minutes of expected times. I know the fares are competitive, but overall I felt fleeced.

### "Basically useless and disrespectful"
I now understand better the low reviews Etihad gets here on Skytrax. The first flight Rome - Abu Dhabi was on time, but with the usual things I have found people complaining about: small meals (not enough), advertisement shown several times during the flight, ground staff and crew not very polite nor friendly. But the worst came after. The flight Abu Dhabi - Hong Kong was delayed by ~1h, which meant missing my connection in Hong Kong. Ground staff in Hong Kong provided a lunch voucher (only after I complained and insisted for myself and fellow passengers) worth 90 HKD, which, in the restaurants that accepted it, was barely enough to get the cheapest item on the menu. Tells you already a lot about the airline policy and how much they value their customers. Had to wait several hours at the airport, ended up arriving at my final destination ~10h later than originally scheduled. When I asked for compensation through their online customer 'service' (I frown at calling it service) - after a couple of weeks they offered a 100 USD voucher through their travel bank, valid 12 months. Basically useless and disrespectful.

### "avoid flying Etihad in future"
Rome to Hong Kong via Abu Dhabi. Left Rome on time, flight was ok - same low quality in terms of food (bare minimum amount), flight attendants, advertisements shown at the beginning (everyone's screen) and during flight while watching movies. Relatively negative feeling. Then, flight departed late from Abu Dhabi, seemingly due to air traffic congestion in Abu Dhabi (Etihad's hub). Delay meant arrival in Hong Kong more than one hour late, missing my connecting flight to Osaka. Instead of arriving in Osaka at 4PM, ended up arriving later on at 2AM - no transportation, had to sleep at the airport's hotel etc etc. In Hong Kong, after my complains for myself and fellow passengers in the same situation, Etihad ground staff offered a lunch voucher worth 90 HKD - not even accepted in some of the restaurants and in those where it was, barely enough to cover the cheapest item on the menu. Tells you already a lot about the airline and how they value their customers. I then lodged a complain through their online system. And to be fair, they responded (although after 2 weeks) - offering a voucher of 100 USD through their 'travel bank' for the inconvenience. To note, valid for only 12 months. Which is essentially useless, unless you fly with them again. A bad experience, and one that made sure I will avoid flying Etihad in the future.

### "like a cheap low-cost carrier"
Tokyo to Rome via Abu Dhabi. Etihad touts itself as a high-standard airline - in the end it feels more like a cheap low-cost carrier disguised as a fancy one. On this flight there were no major disruptions or issues, but several small things that when added up make the overall experience rather unpleasant. First of all - inflight meals are kept to a bare minimum: a single dish with a small side for dinner, and a single small dish for breakfast. Not enough, and they extensively advertise additional snacks or food to be bought aside. Quality of the food was ok. Bad image since it is obviously for cost-saving. Second, on the long-haul Tokyo - Abu Dhabi, no snacks, nothing offered except water between the evening and morning meals. Third, connecting time in Abu Dhabi. On the ticket, and on the boarding pass it indicated a ~1.5h interval - actual arrival time was ~1.5h earlier meaning a total waiting time of 3h. This feels quite a deliberate, misleading action, as customers are more likely to buy a ticket with a connecting time of 1.5h rather than 3h. With more time in the transit area, travelers are more likely to shop. Fourth, flight attendants barely smiling and polite.

### "not one mistake but two"
London to Mahe via Abu Dhabi. I booked my gluten-free meal via phone one month before departure as I am Coeliac. I got a gluten-free meal on flight London-Abi Dhabi but didn’t get anything in the second flight Abu Dhabi- Seychelles. I complained as I didn’t have anything with me and I was starving, they gave me some raw fish for breakfast from business class which I didn’t eat. The reason why I didn’t have a gluten-free meal was unknown however I asked them to make sure that this wouldn’t happen again in my return flight and they took my details. After a week I was going back to London from Seychelles via Abu Dhabi. Guess what? Again, I didn’t get my gluten-free meal in the flight Seychelles- Abu Dhabi! I complained, even more, considering this was the 2nd time. They couldn’t even find something gluten-free from business class and I was starving after eating only a snack that I had with me, I told them that I was starving. After a couple of hours, I noticed that in the catalogue they sell gluten-free meals! Glad to know that no one told me that! I obviously had to purchase it and I asked for a refund days after. Terrible experiences, not one mistake but two mistakes. Days after I asked customer Service why this situation happened and what went wrong, they never replied. They offered me $70 travel credit voucher to use in 12 months which I refused.

### "Crew were efficient"
Bangkok to Abu Dhabi. There was not a spare seat on the plane which amplified the lack of space in the cabin particularly as I'd flown on a B777 in 3x3x3 configuration a couple of days previous. The aircraft was ten years old, and looked it, the decor - never that inspiring - reflecting Etihad's faded glory - use of the very basic Miracle lounge at Bangkok Airport symptomatic. No live TV either. Not all negative, though. Crew were efficient and the full-size dinner tray has re-appeared with a range of courses provided, though my vegetarian curry was poor in comparison to that served on flights from Abu Dhabi. Early arrival and de-planing through an air bridge at Terminal 1, a change from the normal cramming in a bus from the furthest flung extremity of Abu Dhabi airport.

### "flight passed smoothly"
Abu Dhabi to Kuala Lumpur. Busy overnight flight on a near brand-new 787. No spare seats which made for a cramped environment, Etihad is not known for the generosity of its space in cattle class, as I was able to compare on later flights. Check-in and boarding fine. My gold card status was recognized by the crew, who were attentive throughout. The obligatory 45 minutes delay in departure, with the likewise obligatory blaming of air traffic control notwithstanding the banging underneath my feet which suggested something other was responsible. Not too much of a trial, water was provided and, contrary to reports elsewhere, the IFE was active though interrupted with various promotions including the 'sweet and salty' menu; far too expensive. On time arrival at KUL so clearly Etihad factor in Abu Dhabi airport's quirks in the timetable. My first (and last?) experience of the much-criticized streamline food offering. The main meal, a pre-ordered asian vegetarian; paneer & dal curry, with the welcome return of the paratha, was delicious, certainly far superior to a recent offering in Emirates' business class. Nevertheless a few other bits and bobs would have been welcome, and for such time as the tray was on the tray table, there was the overriding fear the whole lot would end up on my lap! Apart from the cabin temperature being set close to absolute zero - always carry a fleece on Etihad - the flight passed smoothly, my bag arriving on the carousel as a I cleared immigration.

### " I was totally disappointed"
Bangkok to Kuwait via Abu Dhabi. I was totally disappointed. Lounge in Bangkok Miracle Lounge which I rate is a third rated one not suitable for such an airline. B787-9 seating arrangement is not good that of Gulf Air. Food below average. Cabin Crew Lazy, inattentive, rude and careless. I paid USD 1,848/- for a one way ticket so it is was not even worth or value for money.

### "Very poor staff quality"
Toronto to Chennai via Abu Dhabi with my minor kids aged 4, 2 and 15 year old on Aug 17th at 10 pm. My 15 year old was denied boarding without valid reasons by check in staff and was not provided alternate travel solutions nor refund and was stranded in airport for long hours. My minor was left out and separated during travel. Check in staff have no basic knowledge of customer service, how to treat the customers politely, being informative and problem solving mentality instead was rude, doesnt know answers for any questions, they dont know the reason for denying a passenger, couldnt provide valid reasons and was negligent. Very poor staff quality and representation of airline.

### "flight attendants were wonderful"
Jakarta to Abu Dhabi. The flight attendants on this sector were wonderful. Addressed by name when interacting. Food service and drinks can be ordered at any time rather than set meals services. Seat comfortable, although little to no storage around the seat.

### "No smiles on this flight"
Abu Dhabi to Barcelona. No smiles on this flight, even in Business class. Not addressed by name or escorted to seat or thanked at the end of flight. Meal service was efficient but without courtesy. New plane but I found seats not as comfortable as the older style as in A330.

### "great selection of movies"
Not Verified | London Heathrow to Abu Dhabi. They have changed quite a bit but they are still a brilliant airline, they still serve after take off snacks and drinks and the meals are very tasty, it will be good if they can give free WiFi for 2 hours maximum. The crew are very friendly, the seats are alright, the IFE screen is good and a great selection of movies, games, music all sorts.

### "they clearly do not care"
Abu Dhabi to Riyadh return in Business class. Onboard service by the crew was professional, attentive and with great engagement with a friendly manner. Both flights on time and aircraft new so spotless. Food and beverage adequate with tasty salads and desserts with non Alcoholic beverages. Where did it all go wrong and why this low score - I have been gold with Etihad for many years and fly 30 + times a year but I have never come across such lazy, rude, arrogant and downright appalling ground staff in Riyadh airport in over 20 years. Whilst I understand that these are third party providers, some measurement of service levels should be put in place, left waiting for over 25 minutes to check at Biz class check in whilst one woman argued with the agent who did not care about her over weight bags. I and other passengers asked to use the Y class check in and told no with a wave of the hand. At boarding handed my passport/ card to the agent who was to busy laughing with his colleague and dropped my passport and then demanded i pick it up - When I protested at his attitude he started being aggressive , shouting and telling me his Saudi. Unbelievably aggressive, the worst experience of any customer service I have ever experienced - I filed a complaint but with Etihad you just get a copy and paste reply, so they clearly do not care, so why should I ? Hello emirates here I go.

### "Worst ground staff"
Not Verified |  Bengaluru to Frankfurt via Abi Dhabi. Horrible experience. Worst ground staff support All lies to customers. No proper communication and response to queries. 14 hr total journey flight they made it a 32 hours flight. For their mistakes they make customers suffer

### "felt like worst service"
Bangalore to Munich via Abu Dhabi. Airlines refused to provide facilities and felt like worst service and no compensation offered or gesture of goodwill. They only offered Breakfast and Lunch, it is worst-ever, staff are  bad since they lost my previous boarding pass and misplaced it. They took passport for applying for Visa but there is no visa also from the morning and no lounge facilities. This is not the first time for me delayed flights (15 hours+ Delay), but this one is very unhappy and I am running as per the new schedule.

### "food served was not enough"
Frankfurt to Abu Dhabi. I had more than average expectations from Etihad it being one of the three bigs of Middle Eastern airlines. Unfortunately, felt nothing like that. Positives : On time arrival & departure. Side head rest on each seat is very helpful. Aircraft was new and cleanliness was taken care of. Swift check-in at FRA for the passengers with online boarding pass. Special meals pre-booked served well on time . Negatives : Leg room disappointed me (I am tall). Quantity of food served was not enough (bad impression if it's for cost cutting). No beverages served before dinner (along with it), I didn't like the idea. Some of the crew members were courteous while others were plain face (One was extremely rude). Overall a fairly good experience. But it always takes a little extra effort to make a flyer fly again with you, which was lacking.

### "I traded in some airmiles"
Unbelievable. I traded in some airmiles for a 'gift' which was to be delivered with NO delivery charges from your airmiles store. A few days after delivery I received an invoice in the post from Fedex for almost double the cost of the gift. This is absolutely outrageous. When I complained to their customer service they just sent me a copy of their terms and conditions to reiterate that I was liable for the charges - in other words tough luck. I think everyone should know about this.

### "food the worst ever"
Bangkok to Istanbul via Abu Dhabi. Service, seat, food the worst ever. Especially the service from the crew, no smiling from their faces, hard to approach them, they only do one service for the whole flight, Not professional at all.

### "the worst flight ever"
London Heathrow to Abu Dhabi. This was the worst flight ever, this would be my first and last time flying with Etihad, crew don’t smile not they welcome, kids don’t get activity pack or toy as they say it’s finished; the food you get no choice as they just give you what they like; when boarding with kids the crew says only family with infants can board first; I had 3 children under 11 years old; the seats are dirty smelly, seats too close to each other they are very much in upright position not good for back; food not good taste less!! Many other issues; no comparison with any other Airline; Qatar & Emirates are the best to fly with children.

### "Excellent food and service"
This was a four days return trip, from Abu Dhabi to Rome and back. Outbound I had the pleasure to fly with the B787 and the cabin (that's a little more than just a seat). Excellent food and service. The onboard crew was magnificent. Friendly, attentive, professional. As a frequent traveller who enjoys movies, it is difficult to find new ones that I haven't seen before. Believe it or not I did find new and nice films and enjoyed it. On the return flight, on the B777 the seat wasn't as good as in the outbound flight but still very nice and enjoyable. I have only a small remark. I don't consider the WiFi good value for money because in comparison with other airlines it is more expensive.

### "lost my suit jacket"
Barcelona to Singapore via Abu Dhabi. Horrible experience as the airline staff took my business suit jacket in the business class cabin for storage and did not return it to me when I had to change planes in Abu Dhabi. The jacket was left in the cabin and was not returned to me when I signalled the incident to transfer staff at the terminal. Subsequently it was moved to lost and found at the Airport. Etihad asked me to pay 80USD for shipment of the item they failed to return. Even when I paid for shipment they failed to deliver it to me. Result: delivered horrible experience during the flight, took the money for shipment and lost my suit jacket. Never apologized. Never reimbursed for the lost item. They have not responded or got in touch with me despite repeated emails. Real shame. All the money spent on creating this airline and marketing it goes down the drain with such poor approach to customer experience.

### "the worst airline ever"
Not Verified |  Abu Dhabi to New York. Absolutely the worst airline ever. Delayed flight, only Indian food on board for my children travelling in economy. Stewardess very unfriendly. Did not want to help me get my bag in the upper compartment. Meals took forever to arrive and usually they were not what I asked for. Crew spoke very loudly in the kitchen galley and could not really sleep because of the noise. They allow children in business class who made noises and cried for the whole 13 hour flight. Very bad experience, would not recommend it t0 anybody and will never fly that airline again.

### "I'm totally disappointed"
Cairo to Abu Dhabi. It was my first time flying with Etihad and I'm totally disappointed. The cabin crew are so rude and unprofessional. If you are charging so much at least hire competent staff. I wanted to buy something from duty free and the crew came to tell me that they are out of stock (3 items, none of them in stock). She didn't even apologize, she just came to say that they are out of stock, turned her back and left. When they were serving the food they had only lamb briyani, no other options. When I asked she said that the chicken got over. Horrible experience. Never again.

### "disappointed with the meal service"
Abu Dhabi to Manila. Very disappointed with the meal service and thoughtlessness of whoever plans meal timings, etc. We boarded the flight in Abu Dabhi at 9:30am and landed in Manila at 11:30pm. While these are local times, it is amazing that Etihad expected us to last the full duration of the flight on just one complimentary meal and no snacks, especially given that all restaurants/eating places were closed at Manila airport upon our arrival. The thoughtlessness of Etihad on this point is staggering. By the time ones gets out of the airport and to their final destination, it is about 1 am. Unless one is staying at a pricey hotel with 24 hours room service, where do you get food? I hope I never have to fly this airline again.

### "Business class is a flying creche"
Abu Dhabi to London. Business class is a flying creche on Etihad. They look after babies but are not interested in providing a business class service to platinum card business people. Had to try and sleep in bar area due to screaming babies. Customer services are not interested in the complaint as they see babies as fare paying passengers even if they lose all actual business passengers. This is the third time this has happened on the Abu Dhabi to London flight. Wake up Etihad and provide what you advertise - Business class or now Baby Class! !

### "Vegetarian food was class apart"
Paris to Mumbai via Abu Dhabi. Vegetarian food was class apart. Excellent quality and amazing taste. Dal, Rice, paneer, roti, razma all excellent

### "I had to stay hungry"
Not Verified |  Chicago to Mumbai via Abu Dhabi. Despite checking for food options at the kiosk when boarding, I did not get the food option I selected. There were no options available for me, not even fruits as a back up. I had to stay hungry for the duration of the flight. I selected Jain/ vegetarian.

### "Bad customer service"
Milan to Jakarta with a transit in Abu Dhabi. The boarding process in Milan was not too good because the economy passengers were jostling to join the queue. Seats in the plane seems a bit smaller compared to SQ, CX and EK. Food wise nothing to shout about. The worst comes in the form of my horribly damaged brand new Rimowa luggage that was used for the first time. A Rimowa is ruggedly constructed to withstand more pressure than an ordinary luggage. However mine had its wheel skewered out of place and a huge dent on its side that renders the luggage unable to be closed properly. And 2 Months later, still no reply from Etihad despite repeated emails. Bad customer service.

### "No way I am flying Etihad again"
Los Angeles to Mumbai via Abu Dhabi. Forgettable experience first time flying with Etihad last month. Boarded flight in LAX for 16hr flight to Abu Dhabi. Floor underneath my seat was wet & dirty (muddy). Refused the blanket they offered to place on the floor, so it could at least dry off. When I collected my bags in Mumbai, the clamp on my hard-sided suitcase had broken off (half of it was missing), so the suitcase was unusable, barely held together by the side clamps. Registered a complaint at the airport then itself. Next day, filed the online claim providing all the documents I had. They have completely ignored all my queries re: the status of my claim. Nothing - no updates, no apologies, no hint of any compensation for the troubles and expenses I incurred because they broke my bag and a couple of items inside it. As if that wasn't enough, on the way back to LAX, they mishandled the other bag. Damaged the extension handle (so that is unusable now), and caused a few rips on the soft-sided exterior of the suitcase. Both my bags (1 Samsonite, 1 Nautica) are of excellent quality and were in near-pristine condition despite multiple international trips on other airlines. I am not even going to waste my time registering another complaint (which is what they would want, but only if they cared for their customers). No way I am flying Etihad again, given the bad baggage handling experience and their lack of response. The in-flight experience was barely passable, and 3 of the 4 flights on my roundtrip itinerary were late, both on departure and on arrival.

### "worst airline experience"
I have flown for many years and this is the worst airline experience I have ever had. Miserable staff who go out of their way to make sure you have an unpleasant experience. Don't ask for water, it will never come. The food is worse than that available on a budget airline. They only provide you with one meal and one drink, thereafter you have to pay extra. I rather not go then travel with this awful airline.

### "I got no reply from the airline"
Kuala lumpur to Jeddah via Abu Dhabi, I few Etihad Airways on a codeshare flight with FlyNas. My experience was not a good one. My luggage allowance across both airlines should be 40kg . When I was in Kuala Lumpur I asked the guy at the check-in counter to send my luggage to my final destination - they kept me waiting at the check-in counter for about 45 minutes. Finally, they said we cannot. You will have to collect your luggage in Jeddah and recheck. I said ok no problem with that but please confirm that the other carrier (NAS airlines) will accept my 40KG luggage because I know they sometimes like to mess up with this issue. They double-checked and sent an email to Etihad head office and came up with the confirmation. Later in Jeddah, the guy at NAS check-in counter refused to take my luggage and said my system say 20KG only. It took me about 30 mins to argue about this. Finally, he felt sorry for me and took my luggage. This seems normal. It happens. My complaint is that I tried to contact Etihad to complain and to ask who is responsible for this issue so that I will avoid it next time but I got no reply from the airline.

### "purchase any snacks they are extra"
Sydney to Athens via Abu Dhabi. I purchased my tickets from a travel agent. I then went back to get extra room seats and allocate my seating. We called Etihad and advised which seats and payed the price the customer service office told us. We get an email confirmation that same day advising us they are confirmed. 24hours prior to our flight i log on to check in on line only to notice i am on my own and my family is sitting 30 rows back. We are flying Etihad A380 Economy class. 15 hour flight from Sydney to Abu Dhabi I go to the airport and show the staff, and they kindly placed us in our seats. When we boarded the plane, one of the front bathrooms has a sign on it "out of order". Mind you there were only 2 toilets at the front part of the plane. One hour into the flight the second toilet fails, so now there are no toilets in the front of the plain for the next 13+ hours. Everyone had to go to the middle of the plain or the rear of the plain. During our flight, i wanted a snack, i asked the staff do they have anything i can snack on. there reply was "if you wish to purchase any snacks they are extra" I asked can i at least have some nuts? sorry we don't have anything available" So i didn't bother as i couldn't justify paying for mid flight snacks, when i just payed $2,000+ each for a ticket. x 4 people = you do the sums... During our flight i fell asleep, I got woken up by the staff as they were handing out some mid flight food. I thought wow thats pretty cool. It was frozen. I thought it was an ice cream, but it ended up being a sandwich/ frozen sandwich. Tasted horrible. The staff on the plane need to smile. People were asking for water, and they kept coming around when they were ready to give you some, with attitude. 4 Weeks later we are ready to come back home from our holiday. So i make contact with my travel agent, making sure we don't have the same problem as we did going. I get another email 24 hours before to check in on line, i knew there was going to have a problem here also, i checked my seating and again it only showed me at the front of the plane. and my family 30 rows back. I call Etihad and advise them of the problem, they can see my booking details and said' They will fix the problem and have it sorted" Then i get an email from them advising me that I have only paid for 1 seat at the front of the plain with extra room and a allocated seat. I explained to the operator, i have an email confirmation from your company advising me my seats i have been allocated. never got a reply back. We went to the Airport a few hours earlier to try and fix the problem, I mentioned what happened and showed them my confirmation email and they said the same thing as the customer service person. At the end of this i asked its not my fault if he only charged me for 1 seat, when we were at the travel agency at the time of us booking our seats and asked for the total amount to be payed, we payed and we got a confirmation email. Their reply was sorry you should have contacted us earlier. I said how much earlier when i have a confirmation" We ended up seating separately on the return, as it was a full flight. I didn't bother eating any food, because i didn't want to get my head bitten off for asking for something extra. This was my first time flying Etihad and my last.

### "worst flight experience ever"
Los Angeles to Abu Dhabi. The flight was delayed by 5 hours without reason! The connecting flight was missed & had to spend 10 hours in Abu Dhabi without accommodation. When try to schedule alternate flight or ask for room, staff answer was “we can do nothing sir”, totally unprofessional and incompetent staff and worst flight experience ever!

### "I will fly Emirates next time"
Not Verified |  Bangkok to Dusseldorf via Abu Dhabi. Old airplane, not working mediasystem, poor food and drinks. Transfer busses instead of directly at the gate at Abu Dhabi which is strange, Abu Dhabi is the home-base of Etihad. I will fly Emirates next time.

### "overbooks it flights excessively"
Abu Dhabi to Minsk. Treated like trash. Greedy airline that overbooks it flights excessively (normal practice) and then lie through their teeth! Was denied boarding because flight was overbooked, Etihad wee passing me from one person to another till the flight was closed without explaining anything. I was offered no compensation or alternative after spending at the airport 6 hours. I watched how kids and elderly people were separated from their families because the majority of the flights were overbooked and they had no duty a care, it was really sad to watch. No care for people and try to make it your problem. It is unreliable airline that has not fundamental ethics.

### "quality was extremely low"
Abu Dhabi to Istanbul. Initially, my booked flight was with economy class, at the gate I decided spontaneously to make a paid upgrade to business which was possible without any difficulties. The ground crew and cabin crew were as friendly and attentive. The plane was old, however, the food and beverages had low quality. No fresh juices on board, the earl grey was watery. Coffees like latte, cappuccino (everything with foamed milk) were not available as the machine was not working. The lunch was partly cold and the presentation was quite cheap. Decided take a nap, I had to ask for an eyemask extra, for a toothbrush I had to ask extra, as they do not have the amenity bags anymore on short flights (4-5 hours). The wifi was available but even whatsapp could not connect. Basically, I had the wifi sign on my screen but it was not working. Fast Track 'flyer' for the passport control were not available and we were advised to show our boarding cards for the fast track. In order to summarize; the quality was extremely low with regard to the food & drinks and service.

### "truly disappointed with crew"
Brussels to Abu Dhabi. I was truly disappointed with crew members and their behavior. They should be trained when people travelling with infants or babies. Actually, their such carefree attitude of flying nannies makes child more disturb hence creating chaos in entire aircraft causing inconvenience for other passengers. Instead of giving extra comfort to parents they treat them in manner as if those families are burden at aircraft.

### "truly they disappointed me"
I was travelling from Abu Dhabi to Paris with my daughter and was her first birthday in flight. I ordered a cake for her on paid basis which staff didn't bother to serve, over to that food served in 8 hours flight was pathetic. I do not know whats the reason behind that but no passenger deserve such food after paying this extra. I chose Etihad because of Pride of UAE but truly they disappointed me.

### "The seats are the worst"
Athens to Sydney Abu Dhabi. My husband flew business class and my kids and myself flew economy. The seats are the worst I have ever seen and have flown every airline you could think of. They had us sitting at the airport in Abu Dhabi with no Aircon for over 40 minutes. The temperature was 43 Deg even the staff were fanning themselves. On the way to Athens we had no inflight entertainment for the entire 14.5 hr flight. The staff could only apologise and said there was nothing they could do. The only compensation was 500 points from their cust service team. They advised that we could pay for an upgrade on the return and once we got to the airport the staff said that was No longer the case. The flight back was even worse than the flight there. If you want no vegetables no Fruit and the same sandwiches and meals over and over than go for it.

### "better services on budget airlines"
London to Thiruvananthapuram via Abu Dhabi. The worst service ever. I would never recommend this flight to anyone. On our 7 hour flight from London to Abu Dhabi, we were served just once with meal and refreshments, which was totally unacceptable. Please do keep in mind that the flight had children and pregnant ladies on board. I have seen better services on budget airlines.

### "Cabin service abysmal"
Sydney to Amsterdam via Abu Dhabi. Due to leave Sydney on 13th Feb, Aircraft went U/S due to engine problem. Delayed overnight, Hotel provided OK the food voucher was insufficient to buy Dinner and Breakfast. Arrived at airport to be told of second delay - Having questioned staff the night before this was already expected! I was told again that the flight would leave later! Pretty clear to all and sundry that this was a very sick aircraft - was eventually given seats on the 777 leaving that evening (14th, which also departed late) . Total delay of 19 hrs on departure . My routing was changed and involved a sector with no J class on a budget airline (I knew this ) but EY staff at Sydney swore blind there was a J class cabin on Flybe. The eventual late departure from Sydney gave a very short transit in AUH to the extent we had to run to get the next flight - no fun in your late 60's (No assistance from EY offered at their home base.) . Sector out of SYD to AUH J class ran out of meal choices about 4 rows into the cabin. The cabin crew found a crew meal which my wife could eat. (Kudos due and given to the staff member but not the airline). Having just made the flight my wife ordered a drink, the male cabin crew brought a totally different drink and then told my wife she was lying about her order when she told him this! Result he avoided any service to us like the plague for the rest of the flight. So 2 sectors screwed up by Etihad - a 19 hour delay to 2 J class pax, Service in Sydney very poor, ground crew unable to manage an admittedly busy situation, Cabin service abysmal especially AUH to Amsterdam. Etihad response to my detailed complaint a 200 dollar voucher to be used on EY within 12 months all of this through a complaints procedure where they have refused to engage with me or answer the complaint. Very poor service and response to detailed and coherent complaint. Yes aircraft go tech but the responses and further disasters in service recovery were and still are wholly unacceptable.

### "share room with a stranger"
I booked my ticket on full price on 14th April. On 12th July I was scheduled to fly back from Islamabad to Melbourne via Abu Dhabi. I tried checking in online. However, I was unable to get my boarding pass. An error “check in not possible” kept popping up. I reached Islamabad airport and I was only given a boarding pass from Islamabad to Abu Dhabi. When I asked for the boarding pass for my next flight, I was told that due to some system problem, I can’t be issued one right now and will get it from the transfer desk in Abu Dhabi. I asked the Etihad staff member whether the Abu Dhabi to Melbourne flight is fully booked/over booked. She assured me that it’s not and I have nothing to worry about. When I got to Abu Dhabi, the flight to Melbourne was indeed over booked. I landed at 7am and was scheduled to fly at 10 am. However, that flight was over booked and the next possible flight was at 9:50pm AND that too was over booked so I couldn’t be accommodated in it. There were around 10 other people in a similar situation trying to get to Melbourne but unable to due to over booked flights. I eventually accepted a flight to Melbourne via Sydney which was expected to leave at 9:45pm. I was given a hotel and meal vouchers by the airline. The hotel room I was given was basically a small cabin with a bunk bed. I was expected to share that room with a complete stranger. Apparently, there was no other room available. I was informed by the Etihad staff that Abu Dhabi visa will at least take 6 hours so there is no point in applying. However, when they saw that I wasn’t willing to stay in that small cabin, I was issued a visa within 1.5 hours. I had to put my foot down and fight for it though. When I accepted to take the flight via Sydney to Melbourne I was concerned about the 2 hour layover in Sydney. The lady at the flight transfer desk at Abu Dhabi assured me that I’ll have enough time to get to the next gate. She promised that my immigration will take place in Melbourne and my bags will also reach Melbourne directly. When I came to the Abu Dhabi airport again for my flight to Sydney, I rechecked about my luggage. I was then informed that I will have to go through immigration at Sydney, collect my luggage and then go through customs again to catch the flight to Melbourne. By this time, as all of you can imagine, I had had enough. I then asked for some sort of document that might help me at Sydney airport to catch the next flight (In case I miss the one they promised). The staff promised to accommodate me and give me paperwork stating the inconvenience I’ve been put through and paperwork to help me at the Sydney airport. I was promised that a person will be waiting for me at the Sydney airport to help me skip all custom lines and reach my connecting flight as soon as possible. When I asked for some sort of documentation to show this in writing that I won’t further be tortured at Sydney airport they assured me to get onboard and they’ll provide it in the plane. Tired and defeated I decided to board the plane. I wasn't given any letter or document as promised. Nobody helped me at Sydney airport - My luggage was lost in Abu Dhabi and i received it after 24 hours.

### "Worst connecting flight"
London to Chennai via Abu Dhabi. Worst connecting flight ever from Abu Dhabi to Chennai - cramped seats - poor quality to sit on for 4hrs - no recline, felt like sitting in a coach. I never felt Etihad would compromise in quality - I wouldn't have booked if this was the case. Never again!

### "Worst airline I have ever flown"
Worst airline I have ever flown with. Our flight was delayed for over an hour while everyone had already boarded because 6 passengers had to be loaded off the plane including their checked in baggage because their seats were broken. The legroom is below average and the seats itself are very small to the point my lower back was aching extremely. The quality and quantity of food provided was horrific and if you want a snack inbetween the ridiculously infrequent and small meals (we were fed a small meal twice on a 17hr flight), you have to PAY for them... I had an upset stomach for days after and I was extremely hungry during my flights. With almost all airlines when you are flying such a long way you get a tray of food, your main meal, a little bowl of salad or fruit and a little piece of bread and/or a desert, not to mention snacks are free. With Etihad you get a small bowl of your meal and thats it. They also do not provide you with a pouch filled with necessities such as a small toothbrush or socks etc. I will never fly with Etihad again. I am not one to complain quickly, economy flights are always a little uncomfortable, but these flights was just shocking.

### "it was the worst flight ever"
We flew with Etihad from Melbourne to Rome via Abu Dhabi and it was the worst flight ever. We normally fly with Emirates. Etihad seat room space was just so uncomfortable especially the long route. The service was just average as I had higher expectations. And the food, my got is there anything else but chicken. And the limited amount of food you get on long flight was unbelievable. I was always still hungry. One meal per flight. Really. Compared to emirates they shine all over Etihad. I will never fly again with them nor will I recommend them. Leaving tomorrow back to Australia and I’m so not looking forward to the flight. I better stock up on snacks for the flight as you wind get much to eat. And I’m not a big eater.

### "Stewardess were extremely rude"
Washington to Ahmadabad via Abu Dhabi. Stewardess were extremely rude as if they were obliging the passengers. The stewardess kept in bumping into me without apologizing and was extremely unprofessional and rude.

### "very bad customer service"
June 31 was our flight I supposed to be flying from Abu Dhabi to Ammanbut unfortunately they lay off me And my two kids in check in baggage. Because the agent told me that I don't have visa going to Jordan. But we explain to them that I'm married to a Jordanian citizen and my kids are Jordanian that's why my visa will be on arrival. We used to do that and this is not my first time travelling to Jordan. Even I showed to Eihad agent that I have my old visa on arrival stamp with my marriage contract when I visited Jordan before ,but still the agent insist that I cannot travel and cannot check in my luggage. I tried to explain to them that if we are a UAE resident your visa will be on arrival. But still the agent didn't accept me and my kids. After that we went to ticketing area to check with them about our ticket. The agent even told us that they will make our ticket open and we can pay only 350dhs per person if we find the same offer. We believe them but unfortunately they also lied to us. After the ticketing we went to Jordanian embassy and told them what happened. They said that I can have my visa on arrival in Amman. We was very shocked. Then the Jordanian embassy start process my visa to have less stress. And they are willing to give me written letter from Jordanian embassy that I'm allowed to have my visa on arrival. But when we call to book a ticket they told us that we need to pay around 9000 dhs. For me and my two kids. Its to expensive and take note we paid already our first flight for almost 5000dhs. Then we need to pay extra 9000 dhs. I think there is some mistake from agent. It's very stressful and very bad customer service. We are not gonna pay extra 9000dhs for our ticket because it's specifically not our mistake. We went back to airport to show them the paper from Jordan embassy that I'm allowed to enter Jordan and to have my visa on arrival but what they reply to us they cannot compensate my our ticket and we lose out money.

### "had a very bad experience"
London to Cochin via Abu Dhabi. We had a very bad experience while traveling with Etihad Airways. I was traveling with family with an infant (6 months) and kid (4 years old). We had requested Bassinet and wanted to travel together. I called agent to make sure there is bassinet and we are traveling together. He said he cannot make sure we are traveling together without paying extra money but he said families travel together. When we went for check in I had different row seat. But was able to sit together till Abu Dhabi. When boarded the flight Etihad Airways 0246 to COK, I had the seat 3 rows behind and we requested with flight attendant to sit together. They were least helpful and said if you want to sit together request with the passenger and swap the seats and they cannot help us. I had to request the co passenger and sat together. It was worst experience we got while traveling all these years.Also even after requesting for kids meal we did not receive it. On return flight I called to make sure that we are sitting together. The customer service agent again said if you want to sit together need to pay. At Cochin airport I was able to get the seat together till Abu Dhabi and asked me to request in transfer desk in Abu Dhabi. In the transfer desk we met some staff who were there for fun time, made me wait with my kid for 20 minutes to tell they cannot help and please request with your co passengers to sit together. They were talking and having fun while my was tired and exhausted with the travel. In flight we had a flight attended who tried hard and make sure we are able to sit near. They did their best with smile. We except only a smile and polite replies while we request. Etihad has lost all the good service and no more care about there customers.

### "average quality airline"
❎ Not Verified | Singapore to London via Abu Dhabi. An average quality airline, prob one of the worst ones. Food quality was bad, neither the main course or dessert was decent there was no regular drink supply, and food trolley only came by once every 2 hours no bottled/cup water supplied so very limited supply of water economy seats were ok, nothing to complain about service was infrequent and average movie selection is decent.

### "food provided is just horrible"
Not Verified |  After I booked my flight, I started reading reviews after a few days and I started worrying. I read that, sometimes they don't even provide water. So i was prepared, i had water bottle and some snacks with me. This flight was just 20% full. The staff was nice. But the food provided is just horrible. The quality and quantity is just terrible. The plane interiors feels really old and the infotainment system is dated as well. While returning back on the same route, the plane was full and you can feel the congestion. The check in staff at Abu Dhabi airport is horrible. They will make sure to let you feel that, they are doing you a favor by doing their job. Staff in the plane was average, not very attentive. And as expected, the food was again garbage. To top it off, my baggage was lost, but they returned it after two days. The bus service provided from Abu Dhabi to Dubai is good. It has wifi and water. You have to collect your bags at Abu Dhabi airport and then go outside the terminal to catch the bus. Overall, below average trip. If you can spend few bucks more, just take Emirates directly to Dubai.

### "would now try and avoid Etihad"
Dublin to New Delhi via Abu Dhabi. The flight from Dublin to Abu Dhabi was smooth. The moment the flight attendants announced that they have snack buy option, I had realised that I am not going to get real food here. A 7.5 hour flight and all they served was a small pasta and some pretzels with a drink. Inflight entertainment was fine, I had blocked seats in something called as economy space, so seating was comfortable. The attendants don't serve you water till they are serving the paid snacks and we all were parched, eventually one of the nicer attendants gave us a water bottle. The Abu-Dhabi to Delhi flight was worse, it was a 2.40 AM flight and I had blocked seats, however as soon as I entered the airplane and realised there is no inflight entertainment (no screens), it was as domestic one could get. Food was okayish, minimalist in quantity, seating space was like a hellhole (and I was wondering why did I block seats), attendants were ok, mostly chatting in their own language (not English) and the flight does not even get docked to the airport. I would now try and avoid Etihad and if I cannot, I would avoid the Abu-Dhabi to Delhi leg at all costs. The only bright spot was the ground check in personnel at Dublin Airport who were cheerful and keeping a straight face even with the huge queues.

### "we were denied veg food"
We traveled from Ahmedabad to Chicago on May 15th. We had pre-selected our meals as Asian Veg sometime in January so we get proper food in the flight. Even after doing this well in advance, we were denied veg food on the flights saying that their veg meals were over. What's the use of pre-selecting meals if there aren't enough on the flight? The data being added on the app is clearly not syncing with their records. After this, the crew also had the audacity say that the meals should have been selected. After this, we requested for at least fruits or some snacks because there was no veg food available but we were not provided that. We spent 7-8 hours hungry and this sort of behavior is unacceptable to me. It was only after we showed them the meal selection in our email that they realized their mistake and served food at the end. The crew was also extremely rude.

### "Budget airline experience"
Sydney to Dublin via Abu Dhabi. Just settled in Ireland and couldn't wait to write the review. What has happened to the food? First of all, food served 1 HR into flight, leaving a huge gap between the stodge we were served. Starving. On the 14 hour leg most was inedible. The food was cheap and nasty. Everything came wrapped in plastic and tasted like plastic. But of course this happened to coincide with a new snack menu that u have to pay for. Meals so stingy that you have to buy extra food. Budget airline experience. Cabin crew were nice. Aircon so cold I couldn't sleep a wink. Had four layers and two blankets. Was this to keep me awake so I would get hungry and buy more food from the snack menu? Lost a customer.

### "ended my trip on a bad note"
I was a passenger on flight EY 10 from London to Abu Dhabi on 18th June. As I leaving the flight to board my next flight I accidentally left a Jo Malone bag with $250 dollars worth of items (gifts for loved ones) under my seat 45A. After 10mins I realized and ran back to retrieve my items from the aircraft but no one was being helpful in advising me what I can do to get my items back. After running around like mad trying to get assistant, a gentleman from Etihad advised I go to my next flight as it is the same aircraft that I had left with my items which I will be boarding again. I spoke to airway employee who told me he had in fact, found the bag and gave it to Lost and Found but said it is too late for me to get my item. He suggested when I get home Sydney (which is the flight I was boarding to) and try to contact Etihad to retrieve my item. I got home and called Etihad help centre in Belgrade who advised that they can make an exception and send the item back to me. I immediately filled out a file and received an email from Etihad Airway that they can send the item back to me. I responded back within a few minutes but I received no further follow up email. After an hours wait I then contacted their Facebook page and the contact person said there is nothing they can do. I got mixed messages from them on my item. It was disappointing to be jerked around and not being told clearly how to retrieve my item. I believe if I had received proper support I would have been able to get my item back within the airport (as I had 2 hours to spare). I will never fly or recommend Etihad again if this is how they handle customer issue. I acknowledge I made a human error and left an item, but I tried my best within that 10 min mistake to do my best to get my item back. It ended my trip on a bad note.

### "worse than that of a budget airline"
Not Verified |  
I travel frequently between Johannesburg and Abu Dhabi, and have always flown Etihad. After my last flight however, I doubt I will be using them again. The food quality was worse than that of a budget airline. The bread roll was tasteless and inedible. There was no salad, dessert or butter. The plastic cutlery was of a cheap quality. The overall experience was traumatizing.

### "they are on a downhill trend"
Not Verified |  Etihad downhill service. I have standby tickets for Business Class, since it was full due to KLM cancelled flight, my sick wife and I were given economy seats. Although the front rows with big legroom were available, EY did not offer me those seats. When in flight, I moved to those seats but was practically chased out by the lady chief stewardess and even treatened to report my action. There was no respect shown whatsoever and she treated me like a criminal. I calmly explained that I was supposed to be in Business since seats initially which was available earlier (I checked 3-5 hours before my flight) but because of KLM flight being cancelled, the Business Class seats were filled. I requested softly but she said its a paid seat and it was Etihad policy not to allow anyone to take those seats. I felt that Etihad does not have consideration and empathy to its passenger's coupled with bad quality food and service. However, some stewardesses especially from Asia except Sub-continent are pleasant. The worst are from eastern Europe. They did not even smile. I have been auditing Etihad since 2004 and instead of performing better, it appeared that they are on a downhill trend. Sorry Etihad you are no better than a 2 star airline.

### "transitioning to a low-cost carrier"
Riyadh to Athens via Abu Dhabi. The flight was ok but the food quantity was not and the taste unlikable. Otherwise, you need to shell out some penny and buy their snacks on-board. This is not a character of a full service airline. Is Etihad transitioning to a low-cost carrier? I know they are cost-cutting but for the price I paid it wasn't worth it. My bag was damaged when it arrived in Athens. Next step, look somewhere else.

### "great dissatisfaction"
Sydney to Frankfurt via Abu Dhabi. Having flown with Etihad for the 1st time, I was initially satisfied. However, my 1st impression has been completely broken and now find myself writing this review in an attempt to express my great dissatisfaction and treatment upon my last booking with Etihad. I booked a flight from Sydney to Frankfurt for my Australian wife. At this time I was unsure about her visa conditions in Germany, so I called Etihad asking how I should make her booking. The Etihad agent informed me that because my wife didn’t yet have the long-term visa, that she need to book a return ticket within 3 months after her arrival, otherwise she wouldn’t be allowed to board the flight to Germany. She then recommended to book a return ticket, as a classic or flex, to have low or no cancellations cost. I proceeded to book the “deal” ticket for the outbound flight and the classic for the return flight. Once we arrived in Germany and my wife was granted her visa, so I then called Etihad to cancel the return flight as already having previously explained I would do. That’s when the cycle of disappointments started. I was told the 1st time that in Etihad’s policy “Most restricted refund fare rule applies in the event that different fare choices are combined” and that my flight is not eligible for cancellation, since I “automatically agree when booking a flight”. I replied that I wasn't told this condition and that I should book either Classic or Flex. I was then answered that an investigation process was being started to check this call and they will contact me. After over 1 week of waiting, I called Etihad again, just to be told that they only traced the last 2 calls, but not the 1st one I made, which is where I was given the wrong instructions. I was told again that they would start another investigation and that they would call me back. After several weeks, again there was no call back as promised. I’m therefore extremely disappointed by Etihad’s customer service. After my most recent call to Etihad, I was told that they couldn’t find the 1st call and starting an investigation and that I would receive a call back. At this point I don’t know if I should laugh or cry? Etihad finds 2 calls, but not the 1st one, even though I provided date and timing, and it was due to that call that I was wrongly informed and proceeded to book the return ticket. Otherwise, I would have never bought the return ticket. It was totally wrong to advise me that I need to buy a return at Etihad to prove that my wife will leave the country within 3 months – since I could have booked a flight to London for less than 50 Euros (having been told this by the immigration officer later on). Also, I would have not bought the ticket for 1100 AUD, if the agent had told tell the canceling conditions, and I made it very clear that I would be cancelling the return flight. Apart from that, the booking process itself was extremely misleading. If you book a return flight, and chose the outbound flight deal for one way and the classic for the return, it is then clearly shown on the return flight that it can be canceled. So there is absolutely no indication that “Most restricted refund fare rule applies” from the beginning till the end of the whole booking process. But it's so easy from an IT point of view. This is misleading the customer when you don’t have such important information which changes the prices for cancellation. I won’t never fly again with Etihad and recommend the same to my friends and family.

### "surprised of food quantity"
Hong Kong to Amman via Abu DhabiThey told me that my ticket can enjoy a stay in hotel as my transit in Abu Dhabi international airport was 11 hours. I was surprised when i got off the plane and headed straight toward customer service counter telling me my ticket is illegible, so I had to pay by myself for hotel reservation. Was surprised of food quantity for 7.5 hour flight.

### "their standards have nosedived"
Melbourne to Abu Dhabi. I'm unsure which was worse, the abhorrent service from the flight attendants or the measly food servings which no longer includes a salad or crackers or butter or jam. I was expecting the same service from Etihad that I had experienced last year but to my disappointment, their standards have nosedived. Quality is missing from every aspect, from the food to the flight attendant service to the range of movies available. Instead, it appears that they are more interested in up selling food and drinks from their on-board menu. It feels like they deliberately make you hungry and/or thirsty by serving you smaller meals and coming around only once for drinks, just so you can buy from their on-board menu. The prices by the way, are not exactly affordable, e.g US$3 for a small nut bar or US$4 for a bag of crisps.

### "feeling like a low cost carrier"
London to Abu Dhabi. I recently reviewed the flight from Abu Dhabi to London. Despite my severe reservations about the food and drinks service, I still felt able to recommend Etihad. After this return flight, my opinion has changed. The food on this flight was poor. The bread roll was in edible, the chicken had an unpleasant texture and of course the lack of food left my family feeling hungry. Fortunately I had brought food from home. The need to pay for food towards the end of the flight is demeaning for all involved and has resulted in Etihad feeling like a low cost carrier. Other niggles include the entertainment system not being turned on till well into the flight and then turned off during the descent. The cabin lights being turned on maybe 2 hours before landing for this paid food service, then the lights going down again. When the price of an Etihad return flight to London Is usually far more than the same flight with British Airways, I really cannot recommend Etihad anymore. I have booked two return flights to London with British Airways for the summer and Christmas.

### "felt like a low cost airline"
Not Verified |  I was very disappointed with my trip flying with Abu Dhabi to Manila return. I didn't expect that the quality of service was downgraded into its lowest level. Food was just a the main course without salad and dessert, drinks was just water or soda, and their last serving of food was just a very cold, hard sandwich with a piece of cheese and offered a tea or coffee. I felt like a flew only in a low cost airline. No amenities at all. The only good thing that i experienced in this fight was the cabin crew. I guess this is my last time flying with this airline.

### "the Middle Eastern Ryanair"
Bangkok to Brussels via Abu Dhabi. Etihad has become the Middle Eastern Ryanair, feels like your flying low-cost for still a reasonably high price. Check-in queues up to 2 hours, without opening any extra counters or an explanation. The food not what it used to be and really little, bread but no butter, no extras at all. There’s only 1 drink round. Staff doesn’t seem to care about the passengers and have loud chats in the back, even at night time. Won’t be ever flying with them again. Sad!

### "I wouldn't recommend taking Etihad"
Moscow to Abu Dhabi. It's extremely disappointing the way flight was handled. Once we got into the plane and we waiting for the take of, we got informed that the there is some technical issues and they have to switch off the power. All of us had to sit with no a/c under +30 digress temperature in plane. It lasted for almost 3 hours, and they were switching on and off the electricity. Some of the people had to ask for medical assistance. Later on, we got informed that we need to step out from the flight (on the same time no one confirm the cancellation of the flight). We had to wait in the airport terminal for 6 hours more to get the final decision that the flight is cancelled. Keeping us waiting we got served with chocolates and water which was already ridiculous, and after all we got cold food from the plane itself. The person who was handling the complaint, first of all, was not the direct representative from the Etihad airways and was closing his name tag as some people tried to take a picture of his name. I hope the Etihad airways could make sure that the flights are working and in good condition before they let people to get into the flight. I wouldn't recommend taking Etihad any longer.

### "found Etihad to be mediocre at best"
Madrid to Hong Kong via Abu Dhabi. I'll start off by saying that I can't really complain as I was paying a mere US$760 to travel halfway around the world to Madrid & back during the super peak period of the UEFA Chanpions League Final. That being said, I found Etihad to be mediocre at best. At least they were fairly on time and make an effort to be. I found that the seat pitch at 30 inches meant that legroom was compromised. That extra 1 inch makes a lot of difference, and I found the offerings on competitors to be at least decent at 31-32 inches, which is perhaps more ideal for long-haul flights. I would be referring to competitors like Qatar, Emirates, Turkish, Finnair etc. They also seemed stingy with the food & beverage & snack service as others have mentioned - hence I wouldn't elaborate. What really irritated me more is that the dhow-shaped tray that the food was served on has absolutely zero purpose other than aesthetics and it kept slipping down my tray table. Super irritating. Many passengers were also irked that the IFE system (specifically the movies & TV) is turned on only after the main ascent & will be shut down before the main descent. That's an hour of IFE gone. Passengers are still able to browse through connecting flight details or view the overhead plane cameras. I travelled only with hand luggage and hence I had no problems or negative experiences with ground luggage handling. But the standard 23kg was offered. As 95% of passengers would only be passing through Abu Dhabi, it is also worthwhile to note that connecting flights are fairly seamless and security probably wouldn't take more than 10-15 mins or so. At this price point (below US$800 for a transcontinental flight) I certainly wouldn't mind flying with them again. I wouldn't be terribly excited about it though.

### "amazed at the decline of service"
Not Verified |  Sydney to Dublin via Abu Dhabi. Having flown with Etihad previously and having had a great experience, my husband and I were amazed at the decline of service provided this time. On the flight from Sydney to Abu Dhabi we were treated very indifferently by the cabin crew and the inflight service was very substandard compared to our previous flight with Etihad and other airlines. Our first meal out of Sydney consisted of a poor quality warm meal, a cold, hard roll in a packet, and a packet with a slice of cake and a plastic cup of drink of our choice. There was an announcement and also a brochure of the snacks you could purchase. All prepackaged chips, nuts, noodles in a cup, etc. No salads or sandwiches, or quality warm meals. Once the meals trays had been removed the cabin crew disappeared. No crew came with drinks. After an hour or 2, I was very thirsty and wanted water and my husband wanted a cup of wine. He pressed the crew call button at least 4 times, (which turned off by itself after about 10 minutes each time). No crew came. So we went to the galley where there were 3 staff. One was eating her meal, the other 2 not appearing to be doing any specific work. I was allowed to take a cup of water. My husband was told to wait for a while. While waiting politely at the galley, with the staff just standing / sitting there, another man came up and asked for a plastic cup of wine. He too was told to wait. About half an hour of waiting at the galley, with the crew, he was finally given a cup of wine. During the middle of the flight a pack of sandwiches had been given out. As I had been asleep when they were being distributed, when a crew member did walk past, I asked if I could have some sandwiches. She questioned me as though I was asking for a second helping. On the flight from Abu Dhabi to Dublin, an announcement was made they would be serving us a ‘complimentary meal’, after which we could purchase from their onboard snack menu. We were presented with a cold soggy bread roll and a drink. I asked for a glass of wine with my meal, and the flight attendant said he would come back with it, which didn’t happen. We were offered a few small containers of packaged water a few times during the flight. The attitude of the cabin crew during both flights was very cool, as though they were doing us a huge service. Positives, the seat was comfortable, the toilets were clean (probably because we had little need to use them because of the shortage of fluids distributed), and good inflight entertainment. We are booked with Etihad for our return flight. I will be and recommend to anyone, doing a long haul flight with Etihad at the moment to bring along your own food and bring along some containers you can fill up with water after you go through security. Would I recommend flying with Etihad at the moment. No! We were made to feel very unwelcome and everything was too much trouble.

### "What has happened in the last few years"
Not Verified |  London to Abu Dhabi. Comfortable seats, good leg room. Service was business like. The food is terrible. What has happened in the last few years with the food served. Ruins the whole Etihad experience. Entertainment offered ok. Check in very slow.

### "the service is low cost"
Baku to Bangkok via Abu Dhabi. I have flown Etihad in the past and enjoyed the service but was disappointed with my latest flight. The airline seems confused as to whether it is offering a premium or low cost product. Certainly the fares are premium but the service is low cost, particularly the new meal service. On the short hop from Baku to Abu Dhabi we received a soggy wrap and a piece of cake with one drinks round. From Abu Dhabi to Bangkok it was a main course (rice and lamb, no vegetables) and a piece of cake, with one drinks round. This was a night flight and after the meal service the cabin crew was not to be seen until just before landing. There is a range of food for purchase but as the nearest galley to me was closed up with the lights off I am not sure where I had to head if I was hungry. Boarding at Baku was fine (the plane was almost empty) but chaotic at Abu Dhabi. The gate was crowded with most passengers having to stand owing to a lack of seats. There was no organised boarding; it was a free for all. Both flights arrived on time. The aircraft was clean and in good condition but the touch screens were difficult to operate and required multiple prods to respond. The inflight entertainment offerings were ok. Etihad needs to have a long hard look at its product. If is to be a low cost airline then fares need to drop. And either way, the inflight service needs to improve. Air Arabia, Indigo and Air Asia, all low cost carriers, offer markedly better products for much lower fares.

### "I do not recommend"
Moscow to Sydney via Abu Dhabi. After an outrageous wait 8 hours the flight was cancelled! I have missed my connecting flight and had to purchase another ticket with another company at the last moment. The company did not offer any compensation, I have lost some significant amount of money by purchasing the last minute ticket. I am unsatisfied with how the situation was handled overall. Passengers boarded the plane and had to wait inside for 4 hours with no air-conditioning or ventilation with a 30 degree heat outside, some people had to ask for medical help. After that dreadful wait all passengers were asked to leave the plane and wait uncertain amount of time in the airport. The crew did no provide any information on how long we would have to wait, we did not even receive a food voucher, all we got offered were some candies and water! Are you kidding me, we were stuck in the plane for hours and you didn't even offer food? I had to claim a refund through the Etihad contact centre but had to call three times in order to get help, seems like some operators don't know how to handle refunds. I do not recommend anybody to fly with Etihad.

### "the flight was mediocre"
Melbourne to Dublin via Abu Dhabi and the flight was mediocre. The food was okay, the comfort of the flight was okay and the staff service was okay. Don't get me wrong, the staff were kind, but the service wasn't amazing. The entertainment was good, there was lots to choose from, and they had lots of services and ways of entertainment. I think the biggest way of improvement for the airline is the food, I've had way better food on other airlines and I wish they had more meal services and didn't make you have to pay to get an extra meal with their special menu. I think the seats could use a bit more leg room, but they did have a power outlet which was nice but it would be great if the seat had a foot rest. The value for money was good though but I wish you didn't have to pay for wifi. The ground service was good though apart from the line for online check-in baggage drop-off, they could of used more staff. Overall, it was okay. Do you get what you pay for? Maybe. Would I recommend it though? Probably not.

### "Worst flight service"
Not Verified |  Dublin to Bangkok via Abu Dhabi. Worst flight service ever. Was looking forward to travelling with a bit of comfort and service. No inflight tv system working. Food dreadful only 1 meal in spite of sitting on plane for 4 hours before take off, no refreshments offered, then 6 hours travelling time. Business class lounge in Dublin was the only positive experience pity not followed through on flight. Not even offered free WI FI. Travelled Emirates business class that is far superior.

### "inflight service has been paired back"
We flew as a family of five from Manchester to Abu Dhabi, and eventually travelled to Dubai on the Etihad coach service. The outbound and inbound flights were on a days old Boeing 787-10 which was spotless as you would expect. This is where the positives end. I was pretty shocked at how the inflight service has been paired back; only one drinks round during which I got the impression one is actively discouraged from requesting anything alcoholic. The meal service is minimalistic to say in the least: one main course and cold bread roll, that's it. No desert, salad, butter or wine offered. Before landing some biscuits offered as 'second snack'. What was worse is the constant promotion of their buy on board menu, which was embarrassing as a supposedly full service carrier and national airline of the UAE. This confuses passengers and ultimately leaves them feeling ripped off. It seems that passengers are paying the price of Etihad's failed investments in other airlines. Not sure who is advising them but this cost-cutting is glaringly obvious and will damage their brand. They may recoup money in the short term but in the long term passengers will vote with their feet.

### "these guys are cheap and lousy"
Brisbane to Abu Dhabi. Disappointed with the cabin standard and service and will not fly with them again. My wife and I were separated and sat apart, the seats gave restricted recline positions, and are a hard course fabric surface. When you are ready to make the bed up, there is no soft linen or cover placed over the seat, instead it’s up to you to recline and may the seat down and simply lay back down on top of the seat cover which is as hard as a rock. You are given a tiny fabric pillow that does not have a linen cover and a blanket. The space for your feet is very narrow and I had to have one leg up and one straight to fit in (I am only 180cm tall) on our return flight, again they separated us and charged us an extra $77eruo for 2kg extra luggage! Simply put, these guys are cheap and lousy and do not compare with Emirates or Qatar.

### "was a reasonable flight"
Abu Dhabi to London. I have flown with them before though not in Economy. This was therefore my first Economy flight with them. I felt it was a reasonable flight. On time, clean aircraft, relatively new airplane (less than 5 years), clean throughout flight. Cabin crew were visible and attentive (day flight). Meals small but tasty, if one needs extra there is buy on board. Variety of drinks available. If as a passenger you desire an alcoholic beverage, the cabin crew are happy to supply. However, its on request, as its an Islamic country and Ramadan they don't offer it on the main drinks service. I felt its was a reasonable product and the crew were nice and worked hard. They did have a variety of sweets on the outbound flight which my children ate and for which there was no charge at all.

### "fallen to an extreme low"
Brisbane to Manchester via Abu Dhabi. For many years i have flown with Etihad and their standards of food and customer service have fallen to an extreme low. On a 14.5 hr flight one actually looks forward to a meal. Etihad used to be fantastic for the food they provided and now it has changed to low cost poor selection. A small little round container with no variety. The staff are not friendly and appear to not enjoy their job. Very disappointed and will chose another airline to fly with next year.

### "one of the worst airlines"
Frankfurt to Islamabad via Abu Dhabi. I have flown with Kuwait Airways, Qatar Airways, Emirates and Etihad. But I found Etihad to be one of the worst airlines among all of them. In a long flight of 6:15 hrs from FRA to AUH. The meal was served once without any juices in between. Whereas, Emirates offer two times juices, with one-time coffee as well. The plane from AUH to ISB was like always one of the worst, small, untidy with zero consideration of staff towards passengers and what not. Inflight entertainment was not working. I traveled during the Holy month of Ramadan and they didn't offer any Sahoor for Fasting. They did offer a light meal but I think it was insufficient. I was allowed 30kg, and my luggage weighed to be 31kg. Ground crew said, sir, you have to pay 60€ for 1kg extra. I said I will take 1KG out of the luggage.

### "heading down the low cost model"
How the mighty fall! I remember flying Etihad 5 years ago on the Johannesburg - Delhi route and it was the preferred airline for most due to their stellar crew, aircraft & inflight service. Those days are gone. Etihad is now a low cost international carrier. When you board; you will be greeted by a 15 minute long sequence on your IFE promoting everything from snacks that you can buy to WiFi which you can purchase inflight. The IFE system then cuts out 20 minutes before landing and is replaced by a set of adverts and the flight map. The meal is a small circular tray which consists of a cold packaged bun, a meal drowning in cooking oil; it consists of zero salad, no butter, no condiments for the actual food. The staff whilst mostly pleasant have also resorted themselves to the LCC attitude of barricading the service levels based on the “class” that you’re seated in. Sure the fares are good and the aircraft is quite empty but if you are looking for good old service & a decent hard product; you can forget about Etihad. The airline is rapidly heading down the low cost carrier model which is unusual for an Arab/Gulf carrier who are normally cash flushed. The nail in the coffin for me was the A321 which they used for the service from Abu Dhabi to Delhi; the flight was crammed, there were major delays and the crew couldn’t handle the passengers which showed that they hadn’t been briefed from the top down. I wish the airline luck in gaining customer and market share back but doubt that people will be thinking of Etihad as their first choice.

### "rude and worse service ever"
Melbourne to Rome via Abu Dhabi. Disgusting food. No alcohol unless you ask, rude and worse service ever, unprofessional flight attendances. They make you starve and thirsty to sell their products. They make you pay Big money for picking the seats. Asked for changing the return and asked me more money than a new ticket. Strongly recommend to fly with anyone else.

### "still using their phones"
Bahrain to Abu Dhabi. The flight attendants need to act on the rule of switching mobile phones off before take off & landing as I’m sure while seated they could clearly hear the sounds of texts being received etc. Passengers were clearly still using their phones when they are told not to.

### "Worst airline I have flown"
Brisbane to Rome via Abu Dhabi. Worst airline I have ever flown. I chose and paid for my seats via their online website and paid an extra $220 odd to choose my seats. What I booked, and what I received in reality once boarding the plane were completely different. When I was booking my seat, I believed I was booking the last row in the cabin, a 3 row seat configuration with a seat missing in the middle according to what I was presented with. In reality, it was a 2 seat row, with both seats right next to each other, completely different to what I thought I was purchasing. In addition to purchasing this so called "premium seat", there was also no storage in the overhead locker. That space is reserved for the cabin screw to put the blankets etc. The seats that I ended up with were not premium by a long shot. It was a total scam from the moment I purchased these seats. Next, is the WiFi. Onboard WiFi is an absolute joke. I paid $5 USD for 30mb of data. This allowed me to essentially check my email quickly browse no more than a couple of web pages before it ran out. An absolute rip off. By contrast, when I last flew Emirates, I think I paid abut 3 Euro, for unlimited time and browsing. It was amazing to say the least. Also, being a long haul flight >14 hours, I decided not to pack my toothbrush or an eye mask as of course you would expect to receive these on such a long haul flight. Wrong. No toothbrush, no eye mask. I was starting to feel like I was flying a budget airline which by the end of my trip I had come to the realisation that, I was in actual fact flying an Emirates wanna be airline. Food. Food was absolutely terrible. Surely you would think you could simply check your seat pocket to see what you can expect for your couple of meals on such a long flight? Wrong. We were presented with "Chicken or Beef" most of the time. No idea what we were actually being served, and the food is not labelled. I guess they do this so that you can instead pay extra and buy from their new inflight menu if you want any decent food? Another telltale sign of a budget airline. Long story short. Etihad are the wanna be Emirates of the skies. I will never fly them again if I can help it. I really thought I would be flying something similar to Emirates. It couldn't have been more different. if you set your expectations very low, they are an ok airline and get you from A to B which I guess is the most important thing. If you want to be comfortable and have an enjoyable time in the sky, stay clear of this mob.

### "the worst food quality"
Melbourne to Abu Dhabi. They have the worst food quality with very little quantity. Food was awfully disgusting (sorry to say that). The cabin crew were not friendly and very rude. Dont try to ask extra sugar or milk. Never had this kind of service before from any airline. No legroom and seats were uncomfortable.

### "buy a sweet or salty snack!"
Abu Dhabi to London. One meal on a near 8 hour flight. Although very tasty, it was small. Ability to "buy" a sweet or salty snack! On a flight that is normally over £500 and often closer to £1000. I will be taking M&S sandwiches on the return flight. The entertainment system needs many more recent films.

### "I cannot say enough bad things"
I cannot say enough bad things about this airline. Just got back from a trip to Egypt and had a total of 3 missed connections because of their delays and their customer "service" is non-existent. I honestly can't remember the last time I experienced such bad service. It started with a 4+ hour delay at JFK, on our way to Abu Dhabi. No explaination for the delay and when we finally got to Abu Dhabi, we of course missed our connecting flight and the agents at Abu Dhabi were clearly not interested in helping anyone out. Finally a lady at the transfer desk started raising a huge fuss and I think they finally took care of her, after she caused a major, loud fuss with the manager someone finally took the time to get. This miss with our flight of course caused us to miss our connecting flight in Cairo. Again, they were no help. Coming back home, we were waiting for our flight out of Abu Dhabi and it's well past boarding time and not a single agent is saying anything about a delay. I finally ask the gate agent what's going on and he says the flight is delayed, ABOUT an hour (this airline has no exact times for anything. we got the estimated departure at JFK). So everyone is sitting there not knowing their flight is delayed. Ridiculous! I will never use this airline again.

### "They don't care at all"
New York to Chennai via Abu Dhabi. Customer service was horrible. I was traveling with a baby and i was having cabin luggage and baby diaper bag! Also i was having baby stroller! When i am boarding the flight in JFK they suppose to take the stroller and they took the stroller before entering into the flight! And i was asked very politely can you help me with the luggage please. That lady was rude and she said no i will not and thats not my job, you have to take by yourself! I was stuck in between because couldn't able handle everything at a time! I was looking for help and a passenger helped me. They don't care at all. Friends please be careful with this airways.

### "worst customer service experience"
Abu Dhabi to Cairo. By far the worst flight customer service experience I have ever received. Arrived to airport 2hrs before and was told it would cost $150 USD for my checked bag. Although online it says all Economy class has baggage allowance going to Africa. I pay for the $150 and head to the passport control just to be stopped again and told I also need to pay for my carry on bag. This wasn’t told to me at check in and while checking in the other bag. Which carried all of my valuables, cards and cash as well. Flight is slowly approaching at this time. I proceed back to the counter and ask if there was anyway I could receive my bag back. They said no it would take too long. So I’m like what else should I do? They said pay, and I continue to explain where my cash/card were. They sat and watched me for 40min distressed, crying, and asking for help and did nothing to help me other than say sorry you can leave the bag here which held over a $1000 worth of items inside or you pay for a new flight. It only cost $60 bucks for the new amount for check in. So I had to paid $430 dollars for a new flight because they wouldn’t bring my bag back to pay and they wouldn’t let me move on. On top of this I lost $150 for the bags I paid for before as well as the money I spent on the original flight.

### "Etihad is the new Ryanair"
Mumbai to Dusseldorf via Abu Dhabi . Etihad is the new Ryanair. Used to love flying with Etihad; travelled at least 3 times per year from Germany to India and back with them. Since my last travel in September last year, a lot has changed. Seat selection during booking or check-in is only available 24 hours before the flight for free, or otherwise with additional cost of 30 EUR/flight. The irony is that the system automatically placed me on a seat in the first three rows of the aircraft which is coming for higher price if you want to book that seat. I prefer to have a window seat in the two last rows, as often the other seats remain empty and i get a full row. This would be a cheaper seat. Still for changing the seat i was charged the full amount. Food: The new trays are pathetic, they don't lock with the tray table and slide on the tray table all the time. They are very small, so they can hold a ridiculously small portion of food. Originally on a flight AUH to DUS or FRA passengers were served two meals (and two rounds of beverages, sometimes even more). Forget about it. One menu, one beverage, done. If you have desire for more, you can pick from the new salt and spicy menu for which they again charge! The Entertainment system is still of the high quality it used to be, but it is getting filled with advertisements for Etihad, the new salt or spicy (chargeable) menu etc. The Entertainment system starts only 20 minutes after take-off and is switched off 20 minutes before landing. That was different earlier. I don't feel that Etihad deserves to be a top ranked airline anymore, as it is not a full service airline any longer. It is rather a new version of Ryan Air, they just don't sell lottery tickets. I am very disappointed with this new trend, so i will look out for other airlines. Maybe pay 100 EUR per flight more, but have all services i deserve.

### "most unpleasant experience"
Frankfurt to Abu Dhabi. I recently had a horrible experience with Etihad Airways, but their service from Europe has gone down extremely. Lounges closed, no customer service, they redirect business class passengers to the call center because the local staff at check-in and gate can not even answer basic questions. My family and me, including our two kids (10 and 5 years old), booked a trip through a travel agent with Etihad Airways, including four business class flights from Frankfurt, Germany, and hotel in Abu Dhabi. We were able to check in online without any problems (we entered all passport information, including passport expiration date, and were not informed of any problems with the passport). After arriving at the airport today, we were also able to go to the gate without problems— but then we were refused to board the plane, because two of our passports were only valid for another three months, not six months as seemingly required by the Abu Dhabi authorities. We acknowledge that it would have been our duty to inform ourselves better before traveling, though given the acceptance of the passport in Etihad’s travel systems it definitely made it hard, if not impossible, for us to spot our honest mistake. But, and that’s really the big problem here where we believe Etihad treated us horribly as customers, when we politely asked your ground personal to rebook the two of us (me and my younger son) to the flight later in the week, enabling us to get a new passport, they refused and gave us a tiny piece of paper with the comment "just call our call center": Seriously, Etihad, is that how you treat your business class customers? And all of this despite them seeing first-hand our 5-year old crying and crying, since the only thing the little guy could understand was that we were not allowed to go on vacation. But it got even worse: The call center also refused to change the booking, unless we were willing to pay a rebooking fee of over $4.500 for just the two tickets. Given that we initially paid over 8.000 € for our tickets, this sounded like an insult more than anything else to us. Ground person pressured us even further to quickly decide, obviously keen to depart soon, so under massive pressure and with no ability to weigh our options, we had to stay in Frankfurt, and did not board the plane. Our vacation was destroyed, both of our kids cried for hours, until we then found a last-minute hotel at Frankfurt airport (the incident happened in the late evening). Overall, the most unpleasant experience I ever had with any airline in my life, and I have made hundreds of flights. And it seems I am not alone, looking at the web, I found hundreds of bad reviews. Etihad lost almost two billion last year, partially in their failed takeover of now bankrupt Air Berlin, and my hunch is, that they will go bankrupt themselves if they do not improve.

### "the flight was overbooked"
Zurich to Brisbane via Abu Dhabi. I booked and paid in full for a flight in August 2018. My agent also pre-selected seats in August 2018. My flight was mid-April 2019. I got to the airport, queued for an hour and when I finally got to the check-in desk, I was told that I was being denied boarding as the flight was overbooked. They also did this to about 10 other people. After protesting with no result and waiting around for hours, I was told I would have to come back the following night for a replacement flight and guess what I'm no longer flying direct to Amsterdam, I have to fly to Rome and then get a connecting flight from there (which overall added about 5 hours to the travel time). They left this bit out actually - I just saw it on the re-issued travel documents much to my dismay. In total I lost a day and a half of my trip. My trip was about 19 days in total so to lose that much time was considerable. I had to change hotel reservations, cancel plans to visit a certain location (because of the time I lost), travel an hour home, travel an hour back the next night, wait again to check in hoping I wouldn't be stung a second time. The flight over was dreadful. I was assured that I had been given the seats I wanted however when I got on the plane I realised that this was incorrect and therefore had a very uncomfortable flight with no sleep. I complained to the head office by email however I was told nothing else would be done and basically they overbook sometimes and I just had to deal with that. Did it matter I paid them in full nearly 9 months in advance? Not at all. Did it matter my agent had pre-selected seats 9 months before? Not at all - no record apparently. Did it matter this was my third long-haul flight with the airline in four years? Nope. I will never fly this airline again. The upset they caused me when I've been a loyal customer is disgusting. You have to pay for in-flight wifi (which you don't have to on some other airlines I have flown with recently).

### "I was bumped off my flight"
Do not fly with Etihad if you want the flight you paid for. They have a widespread policy this spring/summer of massively overbooking flights (I saw around 50 people who'd been put in the same position as me in the space of an hour) and, unlike other airlines, do not routinely offer money or upgrades to incentivise passengers to switch their flight so that people who really need to get on the flight can get aboard. I was bumped off my flight back to Manchester from Abu Dhabi as the flight had been massively overbooked. As a result I lost a full days pay yet I was offered no explanation, apology or hotel - even though the wait was over 8 hours in the middle of the night, and had to sleep in the airport lounge. They offered me a $300 Etihad voucher (useless to me as I will never fly with Etihad again after this experience) and they refused to upgrade me to business class on the flight the next day (which set off 2 hours behind schedule) so that I could get some sleep, despite admitting that there were 9 business class seats available. Note that there is no complaints policy (no number/ email) other than a 'feedback form' and, unlike almost any other airline, Etihad is not EU registered and therefore if they mess you around and ruin your journey as they did mine then there is nothing you can do to claim compensation (unless you're travelling within the EU). Even members of staff at the airport were admitting that the overbooking policy was ridiculous yet when I complained via the form I was simply told that no compensation other than the voucher would be offered and that they 'look forward to welcoming me on another Etihad flight soon'. It completely ruined my trip and, having looked at the thousands of other reviews of people with similar experiences, I would highly recommend to anyone that they avoid this airline and travel with a more reliable and professional one.

### "don't recommend flying Etihad"
Melbourne to Abu Dhabi. I was unimpressed with the meal service. The food portions small and quality was below average. The thing that annoyed me most however was the new trays. It doesn’t stabilise on the seat back tray and moves around while you are trying to eat which lead me to spill me orange juice all over the carpet. This new “enhancement” in dining by Etihad has eliminated the need for the caterer to build the tray, instead the flight attendant is now required to do so. An obvious cost cutting measure, however, this also extends the whole meal service and there were a lot of unhappy unsatisfied passengers waiting longer than we normally would wait if the tray was prepared beforehand like it is with every other airline. In addition, I found the the flight attendants to be extremely rude and disinterested. I had to press the call button four times to ask for water because they kept turning it off. I don't recommend flying with Etihad.

### "the service was hopeless"
I have travelled a lot in the last 40 years being part of multinational companies. I had the misfortune of travelling from Islamabad to Sydney via Abu Dhabi on 1 May by EY234 and to further to Sydney by EY450. Beginning with Booking Counter at Islamabad, our Australian passports and tickets to Sydney were not enough but they demanded our valid Pakistani passports to confirm that our stay in Pakistan had been legal, as they said. I thought only immigration authorities could put such questions. My wife casually mentioned pain in her shoulder to me due to an old fracture, she was asked to get the doctor’s certificate for travel. Somehow we met their requirements and then boarded the flight. During the flight the service was hopeless, the meals even Kosher meals were not fresh, rather cold and I would grade 3rd class. Next flight to Sydney from Abu Dhabi was 45 minutes late. Some comfortable seats that were unsold, remained unoccupied and the staff did not allow upgrading to anyone. The service was again hopeless and meals including Kosher meals were disappointing. The staff vanished for about 4 after serving initial meals and returned only to deliver next prepared, cold and poorly packed meals.

### "their cost-cutting got out of control"
Moscow Domodedovo - Abu Dhabi return in economy. I used to give high marks to Etihad, but unfortunately their cost-cutting got out of control, to the point I can no longer recommend them. You either have to pay for your seat selection now or give yourself anxiety by checking-in 48 hours before the flight with auto-allocated seat and then changing it to the one you want 24 hours before the flight for free - that is, if there are any left. Both flights were operated by Airbus 321, which should soon get a "refurbished" cabin with no IFE screens (and the flight from Moscow is 5 hours long). I lucked out in having the old planes, so the screens were there. Ground service in Moscow was quite bad, with the staff being apathetic and rude, not enforcing any lines, being horribly slow at boarding etc. The flights were completely full. Seating was not that bad, with acceptable pitch and good seat width, but nothing to write home about. The meal service was just embarassing - there is no more salad, no more proper dessert, no cheese or butter. You just get a hot dish (which is not larger than before, unlike Etihad claims) with mediocre taste and a bun or two. That's it. The point is to leave you hungry so that you buy - yes, buy - snacks from their onboard menu. There were no printed menus for the complimentary meal service, so I could not know even what drinks were available. On the way to AUH I requested white wine with my meal and then asked for the same when they brought around coffee. The crew member says they all ran out! I did not see people drinking large quantities of wine, so I guess they just loaded 1-2 bottles for the whole cabin on a dinner-time flight. Embarassing. The IFE was quite decent but the system kept microfreezing, which was annoying. The crew never brought around any drinks apart from the initial service, but they were very cheerful and pleasant and ready to assist when you asked them. There were no blankets, just small pillows. On the way back it was pretty much the same, only the crew did frequent water runs through the cabin. The food was just as sad. I paid for a bulkhead seat and was surrounded by screaming and shoving children, so the flight was a nightmare. Overall, I don't get Etihad's positioning at all. They used to be a premium airline, but now they are mediocre with strong low-cost influences, which does not relfect in the pricing. I would avoid in the future.

### "would never recommend Etihad"
Melbourne to London via Abu Dhabi. We paid to select seats to guarantee that we were seated together. I had heard stories of couples not being allocated seats together. We found the website very slow and after doing 8 seat allocations for the four flights the Etihad site crashed. When we logged on again we found that my husband was in a seat further down the plane in a section which was $86.50 more expensive to select than the seats we had been selecting. We had not selected that seat! We had only selected the cheaper option on all the 8 allocations and always had 2 seats together. We straight away contacted Flight Centre who dealt directly with Etihad and they placed him in the row with me in the cheaper seat allocation area. We have been trying since March to recover the cost of that error on their system but they tell us it is not refundable! The fact that we had to pay $385.70 to select seats in the first place is not acceptable. This was our first overseas trip and we would never recommend Etihad or fly with them again.

### "the worst long haul flight"
Sydney to Abu Dhabi via London. Easily the worst long haul flight I have been on. Cabin was aged but acceptable. Back seat screens were tiny but workable. But the food, this was a 14 hour flight. Initial dinner meal was simply the foil tray (half filled with a single tiny piece of beef) and a tiny bread accompaniment. No side salad, no fruit. Dessert was a tiny brownie. No further food was served for 11 hours. And when it was, it was a similarly tiny meal. And with no dessert this time! We were also warned of "soft turbulence" but I had checked the weather before take off and it looked as if we were going to fly between two tropical storms. It turned out to be the roughest flight I have ever been on - the seatbelt sign stayed on for 5 hours straight (although after a while the FAs ignored this). One of the storms later became cyclone Fani. I appreciate the pilots cannot control the weather but it is always preferable to be warned. I will not ever fly this airline again.

### "grumpy and cold crew"
Not Verified |  Brussels to Bangkok via Abu Dhabi. In 2014 we last flew with Etihad. It was quite decent then. But now, grumpy and cold crew. Paying for seats. Paying for snacks. Low quality meals. We were flying with small children. During meal time the kids were sleeping. Crew didn't bother to ask us whether they wanted to eat or drink. It was like,  great kids are sleeping, why bother. Continue like this and passengers wil ditch Etihad for Qatar. Now that's an airlines that knows what service and hospitality means. To be honest. We are not looking forward to the return flights.

### "a low cost style"
Paris to Abu Dhabi. I hadn’t flown Etihad for 2 years (always tried to avoid after multiple disappointments) and decided to give a new chance to them. It was a huge mistake. Check in staff created a big issue for 1.2 kgs extra while I didn’t have any hand luggage because of my back pain but forced me to carry it or pay. They actually gave me the option of putting those 1.2 kgs in the garbage. Crews seems disinterested in their work and you feel they are doing you a favor being on board with you. I am an easy traveler and always go to the galley if I need water or anything. But they let you feel that you are disturbing them. But they are fine to talk loudly about their life and personal matters. Food was a joke not about the quantity but the quality. Couldn’t eat it and the onboard paid for food was not really interesting to me. I was lucky enough to have my preferred seat but a whole family of 5 was separated during a 7 hours flight. I understood that EY is going through hard time but at least make the ticket price more affordable as it isn't worth all this money for a low cost style. I will definitely not fly with them again.

### "Qatar Airways are streets ahead"
Sydney to London via Abu Dhabi. Possibly the worst long haul airline I have flown with and I’ve been flying for 50 years. You have pay to select a seat at online check in. Food minuscule 14hr flights, one hot dish and a breakfast 12 hrs later. Service ignored one hour request for a second glass of wine. You must purchase food in between meals. Staff cold and indifferent. Do not fly with this airline Qatar Airways are streets ahead.

### "service has deteriorated"
Manila to Abu Dhabi. Etihad used to be a great airline and I always chose to fly with Etihad going to Manila and coming back in UAE. The service has deteriorated in the past years. The food was worst compared to other flights to Manila from GCC (Emirates, Philippine Airlines, Gulf Air and Oman Air). You better bring extra food as you may get hungry during the flight. Online check is worst. I have tried to check in online 48 hrs before my flight as advertised in their website, but I cannot select my seat and asked to pay for seat selection. While it has been their practice now to pay for your choice seat during ticket booking, I don't understand why you'll still have to pay for it to check in online 48 hours before your flight. Better remove the online check in facility because it is useless anyway. I ended up checking in the airport because I don't want to pay for my seat selection. I will try to avoid Etihad at all cost if I can, than to suffer with their bad services. My ticket is not cheap compared to other Manila ticket offered during my flight and yet I get the worst service from Etihad. No to Etihad again.

### "Friendly cabin crew"
Bangkok to Lahore via Abu Dhabi. Etihad is a good and comfortable airline to fly with. Friendly cabin crew. However they need to improve in their inflight entertainment and meals on board. Touch screen on the entertainment was really horrible and front camera of the aircraft was not working. Secondly meals as compared to Qatar and Emirates are not that good in terms of taste and amount.

### "the most inconsistent service of any airline"
Flew long haul AUH to MEL in economy and was disgusted with the level of service and the dismal food offered. The flight was delayed by two hours which was find but it was the way the ground staff handle the situation that was abysmal - they left many passengers confused and stressed. Re the inflight experience - the drinks cart only came around twice throughout the entire flight 14 hour. They serve smaller meals (bun + small meal) so you’re still left hungry afterwards. This is when you’re compelled to buy snacks from their expensive “Sweet & Salty” menu because this is no longer complimentary. When I approached the crew to purchased duty free products I did not find them to be friendly. This is where I usually struggle with Etihad, because I find they have among the most inconsistent service of any airline. Some crews are great, while others aren’t, though a majority of crews are just mediocre, in my experience. They’ve changed up their business model and rather than being a global airline, they want to be a boutique airline serving those traveling to & from Abu Dhabi. Presumably they’re hoping to attract premium yields with that, and if that’s the case, making the product worse isn’t the way to go. These penny-pinching measures could send this once highly regarded airline spiralling down from an amazing airline a few years back to almost a low cost carrier now.

### "once Etihad but never again"
I'm a frequent traveller between Amsterdam and Bangkok, and use normally Qatar Airways. Due circumstances I had to fly now with Etihad. (25-04-2019, EY 401). My trip from Bangkok to Abu Dhabi was a real disaster. Concerning the airplane it was really bad, the seat are so hard and very small, maybe designed for gnomes. The audio/video system was very bad and outdated, moreover the choice of music was very poor (lots of arabic and unknown artists). The service experienced the on board was very bad, the crew were grumpy and not friendly. When I asked for a drink they didn't want to give me one, I had to wait for the food service. Arrived at Abu Dhabi airport and transport was by busses and then to queue for safety check, a big mess, so crowded and not organised. The airport itself was also a big mess, the area around the gate was too small. So for me it was once Etihad but never again. I will advise them to take note from Qatar or Emirates.

### "the inflight catering was very very basic"
Not Verified |  Abu Dhabi to Amsterdam. Having flown many many long haul flights over the years, I have never disembarked feeling hungry like I did with my recent two long hauls on this airline. First time with Etihad and chosen because it appeared on the the 5 star list of carriers. On the plus side the aircraft are modern and clean with ample legroom in economy, also the cabin crew were friendly. However, the inflight catering was very very basic. Never had meals so stingy with any other airline, barely enough for a Mouse. Quality not an issue, but quantity a real issue. One alcoholic drink served for the whole 7 hour duration. The refreshment tray midflight consisted of Water, not even fruit juice. Sorry Etihad your 5 Stars are certainly not as bright as I expected and we will probably revert back to the other two carriers in the ME 3 group. U.A.E are a wealthy country and the national Airline should reflect this. Whoever made the decision to charge for inflight snacks needs to think of the repercussions, they really do need a “Sheikh” up.

### "the worst airline"
Not Verified |  Melbourne to Rome via Abu Dhabi with Etihad. I am a frequent traveller and I can honestly say that this is the worst airline I have ever flown with. The meals are pathetically small and terribly presented. It is the worst food I have eaten on an aircraft. We had one opportunity for drinks on this long haul flight. If you wanted another, you needed to request one. Although I could stretch out my legs, the seats themselves lacked sufficient cushioning and my back was aching for most of the flight. I felt cheated as I could have flown with another airline for the price I paid. Never again!

### "worst business class lounge"
Not Verified |  Two years ago we flew the same route leaving Sydney at 2100 hours. We enjoyed a really delicious dinner and loved the fresh dates handed around after dinner. This time we were looking forward to a similar experience. Disappointed beyond. It was more like a self service cafe with a less than interesting menu on offer. I ate a burger but only because we had time on our hands. My partner had soup which he was unable to finish. Other diners were equally disappointed. This sort of fare is available at any airport cafe and waiters formally dressed does not create a business class lounge. What has changed? Last time it was superb. At present it is poor. The worst business class lounge ever.

### "astonished with the dismal service"
Istanbul to Abu Dhabi. After a fairly seamless check-in and boarding process, I was astonished with the dismal service from the flight attendants. They refused to advise me of the meal options, only that one was chicken and the other was beef and considering Etihad have stopped providing menus on their flights, I was clueless as to what I was having. In addition, as you can tell from the photo taken on the meal served, they have made the entire meal disposable and removed salad and dessert and butter from the meal. I'm a very disappointed passenger.

### "stay away from this airline"
Kochi to London via Abu Dhabi. Simply appalling! Checked in for my flight to London - booked and paid for 2 months prior. Was not given a boarding pass for the second sector and told it will be given in Abu Dhabi. Queued for 15mins to find that the LHR flight was overbooked and 15 checked in passengers are all off loaded. Guy on counter next to me on Manchester flight had 35 overbooked! Offered a free fast food dinner & $300 off my next flight with Etihad (which I will never use!). Faced with a 7 hour wait - not willing to give me time at the airport hotel to sleep, begged for a business class upgrade and given priority to do this upon boarding but seats mysteriously all taken at that time. Staff completely unsympathetic and acted like this is standard practice. This has never happened to me with Emirates - have flown with them over 20 times. Just stay away from this airline.

### "Cheap company - so disappointing"
Cheap company - so disappointing. This is the first time i took Etihad. The worst flights ever. On the way from London to abu dhabi my seat was not working so i asked a member of the crew and she confirmed that i won t be able to move the seat. After 1 hr I requested to change the seat, the flight was full in economy and one told me i have to deal with it for a 7hr flight. On the way back, it was not better , arriving to the airport, overbooked flights, and not only mine all Etihad flights from Abu Dhabi to Europe. Midnight i have to queue and talk for an hour with staff telling me i will have probably to wait few hours and take the next flight. And by few hours he meant 8hrs. After 2h stress and last minute they found me a seat and i left people there waiting 8 hours in the airport because Etihad doesn't provide hotel. On the plane, the members of the crew were unfriendly and one extremely rude. Etihad is not a premium company but a cheap one. From service, members crew, tickets, food ... everything was disappointing.

### "entered the race to the bottom"
London to Bangkok via Abu Dhabi. So Etihad have entered the race to the bottom in style. Simply avoid regardless of price. They no longer bother with pre-dinner drinks, the drinks trolley only came by once on both legs of my flight. The food is the real headline grabber, you get a little tray on a little board, chicken or beef is all your told. Menus are gone, so is a side salad, cheese, decent cutlery, oh and no butter with bread!? Dessert is served after with tea or coffee, and then that is the last you will see of any staff. There is no longer a second meal service instead there is a menu where you can but food and drink 'Ryanair' style, and its all rubbish. The staff look as tired as the Boeing 777's do. Sadly I still have to fly back home with them but will be sure to pack some food for the journey. Will not be back.

### "Really pathetic service"
Not Verified |  Mumbai to London via Abu Dhabi. Really pathetic service and worst airline ever. Had booked business class ticket from Mumbai to London via Abu Dhabi as per there stop over policy given on website after booking they declined a hotel and asked for charges of AED 500, then they declined the chauffeur saying stop over is too less. Finally had to cancel the plan.

### "been deceiving people"
Beirut to Abu Dhabi. Etihad have in recent times been deceiving people in their online bookings, but most recently with their seat selections. When making a miles redemption booking I progressed on to make a seat selection without realizing that I was actually paying for each seat selected. I went all the way to the payment page, went ahead and paid (perhaps I should have paid more attention to the final amount, but it was not clear and I was in a rush to book). Only after finishing the booking I realized I was charged $30 for one seat and $10 for the other, I have never paid for selecting a seat, and these seats would have been free at check-in. Realizing I paid for seats that I did not want to pay for, I contacted Etihad by email asking for a refund of the seat payments. After several back and forth emails, they refused to refund my money. They claim it was clear on the site that these seats were chargeable. I have a relative who also fell for this deceptive seat selection process and also paid for seats without realizing. It is bad enough that they charge for seats (given that are apparently not a budget airline, although you could argue this now), but to deceive their paying customers into paying for seats they did not want to pay for, and then refusing to refund the payment (regardless of who was at fault) is disgraceful! Further evidence of Etihad's greed and lust for money from their customers, with so many examples like this in recent years. The icing on the cake- today I wanted to change a booking I made with miles, and the only way to make this change is to contact the call center. Previously to call Etihad, you dialed a 02 number, which was a local number that was charged at a local rate. However, in line with their money hungry ways, they have now changed their call center number to a 600 number which is charged at a premium per minute rate. So, not just can we not make changes online in some cases, we are also forced to call their call center and pay premium rates for making the call. Absolutely disgraceful from an airline that deserves all the bad reviews it is getting. You should be ashamed of yourselves.

### "food and beverage offering was below satisfactory"
Melbourne to Istanbul via Abu Dhabi. I was hoping to have a good flight from Melbourne to Istanbul but it was not to be. While the aircraft itself was decently spec'd, the food and beverage offering was below satisfactory. They don't include the standard butter with your bread, salad and dessert that you'd find in served at other major airlines. Instead, I was compelled to purchase snacks from their exorbitantly "Choose Wisely" menu. I paid USD 4 for a small chocolate bar. I hope that my return leg in a few days will be better.

### "Very bad and poor service"
Abu Dhabi to Muscat. Very poor service on a codeshare ticket. We arrived in Oman Airport lay over for 1:20mins but unfortunately we have delayed flight for 6hrs then for return back ticket Manila - Muscat - Abu Dhabi again we suffer for 10hrs delayed flight, the staff are not friendly even they don’t explained and apologized. This is my first and last to avail you ticket. Very bad and poor service.

### "tiny and inedible meal"
Paris to Abu Dhabi. I really wonder how this 2/3 star airline made it to the 5 star level. Planes are modern and have a nice cabin with reasonably good IFE. The good stops here. On the 7-hour flight from CDG to AUH, a tiny and inedible meal with no starter or dessert was served and the rest was only buy on board. Feels more like Norwegian than a 5-star Gulf airline. Boarding was completely disorganised and the bus from Abu Dhabi to Dubai is staffed by completely incompetent people. They were letting people on the bus without checking the tickets or the number of luggage pieces. To be avoided altogether.

### "available food is a joke"
Melbourne to Manchester via Abu Dhabi. An airline severely let down by ground staff and cost savings. If you have a bassinet on the booking you cannot check in online & a first come basis. We got to airport before check in opened, only 1 baby in front of us in the queue. Staff advised us that bassinet confirmed and aisle seat, repeated same at end. Come to board, and no bassinet, no aisle etc. Cabin crew reiterated the 1st come message, but when we explained they were bemused. 2nd flight was better but again their systems did not ack the linked booking so not seated together. This is a long route (14.5 hr + 7.5hr) and available food is a joke. You have to pay for extra. No breakfast on landing in Manchester after 7.5 hrs and the main meal is a roll without butter and the hot meal, I was absolutely starving.

### "came late so boarding is closed"
They overbook planes and you may discover that your ticket means nothing and it is first come first serve service. They claim that I came late so boarding is closed  and they charged me new tickets. I had online boarding card for all my family but they refused to accept them.. Then after half an hour they came to me saying I have to make new booking and I have to call internationally to Etihad office to make the booking. I paid 23000 egyptian pound for new tickets and spend the whole night with my family waiting the next available flight after 12 hours.

### "disappointing and underwhelming"
Melbourne to Abu Dhabi. My experience on this flight was far from enjoyable. It was marred with a series of disappointing and underwhelming moments. For example, when the IFE was not working, the fight crew refused to assist me for almost 3 hours. Whenever I pressed the call bell, they would switch it off and ignore my request for help. As with the experience from other guests, I can attest that the crew spend more time chatting amongst themselves rather than serve passengers who've requested for assistance.

### "left more than 15 stranded"
Not Verified |  Abu Dhabi to Rabat. Flight completely overbooked and left more than 15 stranded in Abu Dhabi. Flight alternatives were completely useless. I have to fly with a completely different airline now and will reach Casablanca and not Rabat with more than 15 hours delay. Compensation of 300USD of personalized flight voucher is not adequate if you will never fly with this airline again.

### "promotional fare does not allow change"
My wife and I are in our late 60`s and retired. Last June we purchased, on the Etihad website, two return Business Class tickets to London for departure from Sydney on April 27 2019. The cost of the 2 tickets was $AUD 14,326.52. which was paid in full at the time of purchase. 4 weeks ago I was diagnosed with male breast cancer and so require radical surgery and several months of chemotherapy. I cancelled the flights but Etihad says that this promotional fare does not allow any change of date nor any refund. They also say that the ticket will expire on the 12 month anniversary of purchase. When asked what our options were, I was told that we should travel on the date booked and that was it. A written online complaint elicited the response that I should contact their call centre, who I had previously talked to and who were unhelpful, and on one occasion degrading and demeaning. The purpose of this review is to share our experience, warn others and to request from the wider travelling community any suggestions regarding what to do next.

### "awful inedible food"
Manchester to Tokyo via Abu Dhabi. My review involves the awful inedible food served during these long haul flights. No snacks or drinks offered during the 11 hours. Etihad needs to find someone who knows about airline food. In all my long haul flights I have done in the past 25 years this is the worst experience I have ever had.

### "has really gone downhill"
Brisbane to Abu Dhabi. Etihad has really gone downhill with quality. Checking in ahead did not work, neither online nor through the app. The app actually recommended to call them 'as soon as possible' but then the automated phone service just referred you back to their website. So this was absolutely useless. The check in was then predictably slow with a long queue. As a result the ground team seemed in a hurry and were neither particularly helpful nor friendly. The seats were horrible. For a 14 hour flight this was remarkable little leg space. Cramped in like in a budget airline. The food wasn't very appetising and while most of the staff seemed professional they didn't go above and beyond to make this a pleasant flight experience. A lot of time for them was spent chatting in the galley. Will definitely not make the mistake of flying with Etihad again. Can't believe they are rated as a 'Five star airline'. Absolutely undeserved and miles off, Etihad is currently closer to a three star airline than a five star one.

### "really suffered in two years"
Chicago to Mumbai via Abu Dhabi. We have flown Etihad Airways several times. We have traveled in economy and business class. My last trip was in Jan 2019, trip before that was in Oct 2017, both in business class. The service and amenities have really suffered in two years. It started with booking tickets online. I had select the flights and was adding all the information they need (e.g. passenger name, preferences, etc.). By the time I was ready to enter credit card information, the website would not let me purchase the ticket because the fare had increased (by $1200 per ticket). It took me less then 10 minutes to enter information about two passengers. The price should have been locked. I called them three times and talked with three different customer reps, but they would not help. I even asked to speak to the manager and was not given chance to talk to a manager. I had to reduce my trip by three days to get lower fare. They stopped providing pajamas, slippers, playing cards in the plane. The quality of amenity kit has also gone down. After the plane took off I asked for a single malt whiskey and mixed nut which were served. Later on when I asked for it again I was told that they did not have single malt or nuts. They only had black label. How can you not have enough (small) bottles of single malt for business class? The lounge at Abu Dhabi needs updating. The lounge was very crowded and only had and did not have enough seats. It one mens toilet room (3 three urinal stalls and 3 toilet stalls). There were people standing in line. The type food in the lounge was same as two years ago, they have not changed the menu. My wife wanted to extend her stay to take care of personal stuff so we called etihad, we were told that it would cost us $400 dollars cancellation fee (which is on their website), plus a single ticket from the higher tier for $3600 (this is not mentioned on their website). This is a rip off. Why can I not pay the fare difference? If I have to buy another ticket then why are they charging $400 cancellation fee? We did not extend her stay. It turns out that she has to go again soon, this time we bought business class ticket on Emirates. They provide free limo service to/from airport at both destinations for business class. I have heard good thing about them. I am sure they will be better than Etihad. My friends have traveled Qatar Airways and Turkish Airlines and they said that they were very good.

### "the crew didn't smile at all"
Minsk to Tokyo via Abu Dhabi. I flew with Etihad only once before, around ten years ago, and I was very impressed by the service, food, and those little touches like hand lotion in the bathroom that make a flight a special journey. This time, however, it was quite a different experience. The food on both flights (I ordered gluten free) was just edible, really not tasty - no dressing in the salad, smelly fish. I understand they tried to make it healthy but it shouldn't eliminate tasty by default. Besides, the dinner was cold. There were no snacks at the end of the aircraft. The drinks were served at least half an hour after the food. The crew on the leg Abu Dhabi to Tokyo seemed to be interested in talking among themselves, blocking the access to the glasses with water. I normally drink a lot but in this case I gave up asking for a glass of water because it felt like I was constantly distracting them from an engaging conversation. And the crew didn't smile at all. It felt so weird. On the positive side, the entertainment was decent, with a lot of good movies to choose from. The flight was half empty, so one was able to stretch out on empty seats.

### "Ruined my holiday"
Manchester to Abu Dhabi. Do not fly with this airline! I paid for pre booked seats for me and my family and when we got to the airport they had seated us all over the plane. When I alerted ground staff of this they where rude and unhelpful. They had also seated people who hadn’t paid together which made me so angry. When we got onto the aircraft people where already sitting in our allocated seats so they left us standing for 20 mins while they tried to move people reluctantly. My little girls was crying because she thought we couldn’t go on holiday. After complaining to so called customer services they where even less helpful. They said they would consider a refund for the pre booked seats. From now on when I travel to UAE I will always choose Emirates who are a far superior airline. Coming back they took my money for 4 pre booked seats and only allocated 2 so again I had to contact them to sort that out. Ruined my holiday!

### "gave us different seats"
Beirut to Sydney via Abu Dhabi. I allocated 6 seats for me and family and we paid around $500au for allocation. They didn’t give us those seats and they gave us different seats. We had a big argument with them in Beirut airport and the seats were taken already by different people and we had to take what ever they offered us so we don’t miss the flight. I tried to communicate with them by emails because there is no phone customer service but they changed the story and they said that they gave us the choice of keeping the same seats or change them to the seats we were not happy with. If there story is true why did they offer different seats to us. They offered $188 as a travel credit with them but I didn’t accept it. I feel I got ripped off and no one is actually listening to what I have to say.

### "is going downhill fast"
Abu Dhabi to Singapore. This was one of the worst business class flight ever taken on 5 April (seat 6C). Lethargic and exhausted crew. Not interested to serve passengers. The seat was terribly bad design and most uncomfortable. The flight supervisor would walk between first class galley to Business class galley looking upwards and never making any eye contact with customers. No smiles, no energy and no enthusiasm displayed by crew. Food passable. Airline is going downhill fast.

### "Very bad service"
I am flying with my family (husband and son) from Abu Dhabi to Bahrain, an hour flight. My husband holds the Platinum card which they say have many benefits but we haven’t seen them, on today’s flight we have 3 tickets and We have just two bags one they say was at no cost but the other they charge is 280 USD for the other bag that has just 20kg, We have never been charge that amount of money in any airline in the world since we are frequent flyers. Very bad service, we returned to them their Platinum card since it doesn’t have that much of benefits, we will never fly with them.

### "Food quality was atrocious"
Islamabad to Abu Dhabi. Crew on this April 3 flight EY 234 was not welcoming on arrival, no offer to handle the jackets, no offer of magazines or newspapers. The lady Inflight supervisor had harsh demeanour and and none of the crew would qualify for pleasant personality contest. Did not see any smile on their faces throughout the flight. Were told that aircraft had no blankets left to be handed out. Business class cabin gave a squeezy look with the front seat almost knocking on the back seat. Food quality was atrocious. Salmon was hard as a rock topped with artificial coloring and the coke was flat. A limited menu for a 9pm dinner flight. Salmon or vegetarian and that was that. Desert a chocolate brownie and no other choice. Putting dishes named after Indian cities in its printed menu on Islamabad flight was terrible.

### "Absolute terrible experience"
Dubai to Beirut via Abu Dhabi. Absolute terrible experience with Etihad Airways. My father, in Lebanon, has been rushed to the hospital and I booked a ticket immediately today to travel to be there with him only to find out, once I reached and waited in the line of the Economy Check-in, that my flight is overbooked. We waited an hour (me and my daughter) and the only solutions they provided us was a transit where we had to wait in another country for five hours or the same flight but tomorrow. Sorry, but it is your mistake I believe and you make us wait another day. I am travelling urgently and you say it’s not your business of personal matters. Well it is your business now since you’re the one who put us in this situation. You say your system is jammed well close the system once the tickets are booked. It isn’t surprising with Etihad as it happened with me and my family before and with people I know. There should be changes to your policy, I have never seen such lack of care to the people. Working team and manager were there to help us, but the problem isn’t with them, it’s with the policies and the company itself.

### "what an appalling airline"
Nairobi to Delhi via Abu Dhabi. Etihad, what an appalling airline, surviving on PR only. We took 4 flights with them 3 were delayed. We had a 24 hour delay in Abu Dhabi (enough time there for anyone’s lifetime ) and were put in a terrible hotel, the food was dreadful (I had 3 cheese sandwiches in 24 hours). We lost a considerable sum in lost earnings. No luggage so clothes and toiletries free. We were offered a 100 US dollar voucher for our next flight, there will never be one. Etihad Ground staff need some PR training (not the lovely Indian ones) and flight crew were excellent but seemingly unhappy with their employers.

### "Good selection of IFE"
Hong Kong to Rome via Abu Dhabi. Flew recently 4 segments on new Boeing 787-9s. All seats allocated to me when did the online check in and luckily all were window front seats. Leg room is probably the most generous I’ve encountered on 787 economy class. Service by the crew was excellent. Had an empty seat next to me, which always make the Economy experience more durable. Very good quality food. Asked for alcoholic beverages on each segment and all was included. Good selection of IFE movies. A very good experience with them. Unlike Qantas and many other airlines, no pork served so no need for me to order a special meal.

### "appalled by the lack of care"
Another ghastly experience with Etihad Airways from Abu Dhabi to London Heathrow. I was appalled by the lack of care and professionalism from Etihad’s flight attendants. They seemed very subdued and disgruntled. I tried asking for water and was told to come up to the galley to get it, this was a first for me. The food was again, very unappetizing and miserly, e.g. no dessert with your dinner. As a frequent flyer who used to enjoy flying Etihad, I’ve got now choice but to look for an airline that can provide a service that meets the bare minimum requirements, because clearly, Etihad doesn’t.

### "Absolutely disgusted"
Brisbane to Rome via Abu Dhabi. Absolutely disgusted with Etihads support and services for an incorrect flight and then lack of communication, support and care. My partner booked a return flight with BYO jet with triple checked dates as they needed to correlate with mine and my families, and instead of BYO jet booking them for the 19th April as per our booking online, they booked them for the 19th November the year before which was 5 months before we were due to fly. After multiple attempts to speak and liase with Etihad, they then notified us of a $500 no show fee, which was 5 months after my partner was supposedly "suppose to fly" and it was only then that they told us they'd cancelled the entire flight and would not be giving us a refund, despite me and my family giving them the business of 5 x business class flights. It also states in their T + C that they do change and refund flights for a small fee of $140 or $170, yet they told my partner that they "couldn't" and none of their attempts to explain things to us made sense. The lady on the phone was also extremely rude and arrogant and probably should have had a sick day if she had things going on to make her behave so unprofessionally and uncaringly. I cannot believe how selfish and greedy some companies are. My partner has now gone onto book a flight with an entirely different airline because of some body else's mistake. No rectifying has been attempted at all, all this airline appears to care about is money and not the actual services they provide or even the success of their business. Definitely will not be flying with this airline again, all they care about is your money and not about the actual services they provide. If you are thinking about flying with them, please reconsider your decision, this is not a company that deserves anyones business

### "One of the worst airlines"
Los Angeles to Dammam via Abu Dhabi. One of the worst airlines i ever flew. From staff at the airport to cabin crew. They were very unhelpful, rude and don’t prioritize customer service. I kept asking for an internet voucher at least 5 times. And we were already 4 hours into the flight the crew kept saying i will come back to you, yet no one did. Eventually they did but the voucher was a scratch type and did not work. The cabin crew refused to exchange but instead she gave me my money back. The food is terrible. One of the worst cuisines. Not only that, but only 2 meals on a 16 hour flight. And if you need juice, or refreshments there is an extra charge for that. Last I’ve known this was not a low-cost airlines. You are better of flying Emirates, Saudia or Qatar Airways, they are far superior and way better. Also Abu Dhabi has a really bad airport. I dont know how a giant airline could have a bad airport and have most of its planes park on stands rather than gates.

### "never want to fly them again"
Geneva to Hong Kong via Abu Dhabi. Firstly my flight was overbooked, no explanation given to why and that I had to wait hours to find out if I was going to be held in Abu Dhabi for 24 hours. I was told I was. Then the transfer desk staff continued to ask for my personal information so that he could 'check I got on my flight ok', could I give him my business card or email? and a lot of other personal questions. I was promised an upgrade as part of this compensation, then I was told at check in the next day that this wasn't true and that I would not be. I complained about the inappropriate behavior from the check in staff the previous night and was told to email them. The email exchange with their customer service has been outrageous. They ignore questions, refuse to elaborate and barely apologise for a member of their staff abusing their position and asking for personal information. I asked to be given another point of contact to be told; 'Having reviewed your case, unfortunately, there is no need for us to transfer your case to another Guest Relations contact. I can see that we have emailed you in February and offered 5,000 miles apart from the USD200 travel voucher you received. Might I explain that our offer remains the same. If you are unhappy with the above offer, regrettably, a phone conversation is no longer necessary. They point blank ignore questions and complaints and just repeat themselves. I never want to fly with them again and now have a non-transferable voucher for their services that they think is compensation when really it just means more money spent on Etihad. Lastly, they turn off their entertainment screens 30 mins before landing.

### "extremely poor and stressful"
I flew Business Class on Etihad flight EY484 from Abu Dhabi to Brisbane [12th March 2019]. The Business Class experience with Etihad was extremely poor and stressful. The cabin crew were less than helpful. The cabin manager introduced herself but gave no advice on how to operate the seat or any of its features especially as the seat mechanism was different to business class seats on other airlines. The flight departed late in the day from Abu Dhabi and so the cabin crew were serving meals virtually from the time the aircraft left the ground but I was kept waiting for my first course until the crew was dimming lights and putting everyone to sleep. The steak was uncooked and blood oozing from the meat was turning the potato dish pink. I tried to contact the cabin crew but they said they were too busy and would come back to me later but they did not. I persisted as I was hungry and when I complained I was told that chocolate ice cream only was available which basically was my dinner that night as everything else had gone. I wasn’t given any other food until breakfast was served. I was unfamiliar with the mechanism for turning this type of seat into a bed - the upholstery was so hard that I got virtually no sleep. I complained to Etihad and received an unsympathetic reply. My purpose in writing this review is to warn other passengers who may want to fly with this airline that they should brace themselves for some very poor service.

### "Emirates and Qatar do a better job"
Mumbai to London via Abu Dhabi. I can only surmise that the 5 star rating for Etihad relates to its Premium and higher class products. Ecomony is no greater shakes and I'd strongly say from experience that Emirates and Qatar do a better job. We flew from Mumbai,  the A320 plane cabin looked tired and beige and brown not the most uplifting of decor. Professional staff but only two cabin crew to a whole section of economy seats were kept busy. Professional if a little distant . Would two staff cope in an emergency ? Boarding was something of a rushed affair but I noted that staff do assist confused passengers and with storing and organising bags in the lockers. Trolley service was followed by a very nice chicken curry, not so nice salad but jolly tasty pudding, no cheese and crackers and no hot towels before or after. No menu card either which are handy when passing across multi lingual passengers i.e. What is paneer? Reply, Well, its paneer ! Smooth flight, bilingual announcements. On arrival very poor assistance with transfers although ground staff met the plane, no interaction with transfer guests was noted. Flight to London was better. More cabin crew, attentive, professional but same meal plan, no menu card., no cheese and crackers and availability of wine with meal was obscure. I've never had a vodka and orange with dinner before. Washroom had no water supply. Deal fare was very good value.

### "had an overweight baggage"
Mumbai to Sydney via Abu Dhabi. Worst customer service at the boarding pass counter. It all started at counter where i was waiting to get my boarding pass with my infant. One staff offered me to join the business class line to get my pass quickly as he noticed my pregnancy and my cranky child and the fact that i was travelling by myself. I appreciated his gesture. But at the business class counter I was told told that i had an overweight baggage of 2 kilos on which i decided to get rid of the extra kilos, so i left the queue. After returning to the counter back I waied patiently for 40 min. That is when i got upset and raised my voice to say even i was a paid passenger and had solved the baggage weight issue so if he could please issue my boarding pass. Then they decided to check weights of all the bags and i had to pay extra for a couple of kilos. The airline should look for some polite and well mannered people to serve at the counters. This incident was a nightmare.

### "Very disappointed"
Johannesburg to New Delhi via Abu Dhabi. Very disappointed with service and food. We order special Asian veg meal. Was awful. Same with snack. Could not eat anything. Whole flight nothing to eat. Allocated me and my wife separate seat on Abu Dhabi to Delhi sector. Manage to get it together any how. Was thinking got the ticket for cheap but now feel like total waste. Emirates is the best for us. Hope not to travel again in Etihad. Flight attendents very unprofessional. Ask for coke said we don't have its finished. Then later on other attendent gave. Where she got it from. Pathetic.

### "have zero respect for customers"
Abu Dhabi to Tokyo. My last experience with Etihad is a nightmare. I bought a flight with them to Tokyo Narita more than a month earlier than the travel date. I arrived at the airport 3 hours before the flight departure. Still, I was not allowed boarding because of overbooking? I was not given any explanation or whatsoever for I why could not fly despite having a confirmed ticket and having arrived 3 hours before departure! what kind of service is this? I cannot trust this company anymore. Because of them, I missed an important conference. I was given a ridiculous compensation of 300USD which sounds like a joke. I do not recommend this company to anyone, especially if you are traveling for business. They are not reliable anymore and they have zero respect for customers.

### "was extremely disappointed"
I recently flew Etihad from Abu Dhabi to Melbourne and was extremely disappointed with their service. Their standards fell well below that of other airlines, especially Emirates. This 5-Star airline has evidently cut costs in all areas of their service, including their menu (e.g. the breakfast tray only has your meal of choice and a small fruit box). Passengers were encouraged to instead purchase food items from Etihad's overpriced "Choose Well" menu (see image). 3 hours into the 14 hours, the FA's decided to lazily lock 2 of the toilets that were messy to prevent them from being used instead of clean them. In-flight Wi-fi was available albiet only for 30 minutes after take-off and 30 minutes before landing. Considering the price you pay (US$30 and capped at just 100mB) I found this to be shameful. Emirates on the other hand charge you $15 for the entire duration of the flight and I had internet access for almost the entire flight. Etihad's prices are not competitive enough to justify such an appalling experience.

### "food heavily spiced and quite inedible"
Bangkok to Abu Dhabi. Not quite up to the standard of my previous Etihad flight a fortnight previous but not dreadful either. Check-in fine. Etihad use the generic lounge at Bangkok which, by current standards, is basic. More seriously, few if any power sockets. Fortunately power available on the aircraft. Boarding and takeoff delayed 45 minutes due to the tardy removal of the previous flight from the gate, as well explained by the pilot; few minutes late arriving. Crew attentive, regularly passing through the cabin with water and responding to ad-hoc drink requests. Also efficiently dealt with a medical emergency though the unfortunate lady's violent bout of vomiting may have had something to do with the food which, if she had the same meal as I, was grim; far too heavily spiced and quite inedible. Plenty of movies but nothing to see. Etihad offers little in the way of 'Hollywood classics' to pass the time. Deplaned through a gate rather than by bus, a rare event at Abu Dhabi airport. Bags promptly delivered.

### "impressed with all four legs"
Flew Brussels to Delhi via Abu Dhabi. I had not taken Etihad before, and I was impressed with all four legs. The business class seats on their B787 was amazing - beautifully designed, comfortable, spacious, and with plenty of storage. I slept very well. The IFE was good, with a reasonable selection of films and shows. I found the food and wine to be of a high standard and enjoyed my meals; there was a good selection and it was all very tasty. The Acqua di Parma amentity kits were lovely and well stocked. All of the crew were excellent - friendly and attentive. I had four very good flights and was impressed with the service, food and hard product.

### "Worst ever airline"
New York to Muscat via Abu Dhabi. Worst airline ever! On way back, we arrive at New York 3 hours early to find out your flights been delayed - by 7 hours! So we need to wait 10 hours. 22 kids with us- 14 hour flight as is and all they can do? Offer a dinner and breakfast voucher. But the voucher is useless because everything closes by 12. To add insult to injury, the stop over in Abu Dhabi originally 2 hours is now 6.5 hours - no food voucher for that. No hotel, no compensation, no explanation and no willingness to fix or make right. Just told not our problem and we don’t have to fix anything! They have added 13.5 hours to our flight - as it’s just been delayed by another 30 min, but they don’t care. Sit in the uncomfortable chairs and wait is their motto. Worst ever airline.

### "the worst of economy"
Not Verified |  Dublin to Bangkok via Abu Dhabi. Chose to travel business class for extra comfort on long haul flight. Unfortunately chose Etihad apart from seats being more comfortable everything else was the worst of economy I have ever traveled on. Daytime flight from Dublin leaving 7 30 am, given lunch menu, no breakfast just coffee and biscuit, lunch served. I requested it at 12 Irish time. My inflight TV system wasn't working was given small tablet to watch a film. After lunch which would have been maybe 14.00 Irish time lights turned off as if night flight.cabin crew no where to be seen. Late landing in AUH so boarded next stage of journey to Bangkok. Sat on plane 4 hours due to technical fault. No refreshment offered.again cabin crew in galley.no help.i asked for refreshments was handed an open packet of nibbles one of them was eating. .i did complain to customer service.have been offered 400d ollars credit. to use on future flight. O explained would not not be doing a long haul light again in the next year but was told take it or leave it the matter is closed as far as they are concerned. The return flight was ok but as most of journey was overnight slept most of the time.

### "power sockets did not work"
Manchester to Abu Dhabi. I chose business class so I could continue to work on the flight home. The power sockets did not work. The cabin staff tried to resolve it, but all of them did not have power for more than 3 seconds. No plug socket power on an 8 hour flight in business class is not acceptable. To follow up this shambles, after an official complaint, I was completely fobbed off as if there had not been a problem. Avoid at all costs.

### "Need special cleaning service"
Jakarta to Abu Dhabi. The crew cabin doesn't care about the cleanliness of the lavatory throughout the trip. Need special cleaning service on board perhaps. Not have menu in the pocket, and serve heavy meal only once.

### "recommend this airline"
New York to Abu Dhabi. Excellent staff, kind and upgrade option is very nice. Blankets are soft and comfy and seat reclines far back. Meals are good and consist of a main dish (rice,pasta.etc),bread and butter, side dish and desert. Asian Vegetarian meals are very good and meals are served hot. I would recommend this airline.

### "quality has stabilized"
Abu Dhabi to Singapore. Reviewing Etihad presents a problem: Do you benchmark against what was provided before the austerity programme implemented by the current management, or do you assess on the basis on what is available now in comparison to recent performance? In this case, the latter As a Gold Card holder who's been using Etihad for the past decade, there is little doubt austerity has taken its toll. Those little extras that were long one have long gone. However, based on my albeit limited sample, quality has stabilized. For UAE-based customers at least, Etihad's fares are substantially lower than Emirates. And if the company isn't paying, price trumps all else. The flight was unremarkable. A bus was used for boarding, actually preferable in a cool winter's evening as it prevents the crush as the aircraft entrance. Departure was a little delayed with around an hour sat on the tarmac going nowhere, however arrival was 20 minutes ahead of schedule the bags delivered immediately immigration was cleared, which never takes long in Singapore. The economy section was barely half full offering plenty of room. The special meal ordered - asian vegetarian - was passed around without the offer a drink; as always,paneer curry, daal and rice - it never varies. No breakfast only an unappetizing roll; better if they hadn't bothered. Movie selection on the IFE was a bit thin but I love the live TV feature, even if the football match being shown was rubbish - at least it sent me to sleep. To dispel criticism often levied at Etihad, the IFE was activated within 15 minutes of boarding and remained available, other than the obligatory adverts, almost to the arrival gate at Singapore. Whether the disco lighting is a feature of the 787 or a local initiative of the crew, a nice touch to relax the atmosphere on board.. Crew were attentive though loved to gossip - I was close to the rear galley.

### "one of the worst trips"
Istanbul to Abu Dhabi via Kuwait. I had one of the worst trips. The screen wasn't working the flight attendant was really mean, didn't even bother to answer my calls and on my 2nd flight there was a delay - again no explanations no solutions. After 30 min of waiting they tell us things has worked. I don't recommend this airline.

### "not use this airline again"
Düsseldorf to Bangkok via Abu Dhabi. I will not use this airline again. I don’t recommend Etihad and will personally stay away. They charge up to 30€ for your online check-in, because they charge you for the seats you choose. This is not acceptable. For the first flight, it was mandatory for me to show my payment card at the counter, so online check-in was off the table anyway. It’s probably some law or security measure, but inconvenient nonetheless. In addition, Etihad has sent me at least 20 Spam E-Mails. I want to know which genius in this company thought it would be a great idea and a sure way to convince people to upgrade to Business class, if you spam their E-Mail Account. Just stop sending E-Mails. Flights were alright, second leg was delayed by 3hrs and I was not able to choose the seat that I wanted. They ran out of beer on the second leg, too. Not that it matters that much, but a little inconvenient. I am tall, and legspace is a big issue. Seats with more legroom (i.e. emergency exit) cost about 130€ (for my booking class). Anyhow, seats are very uncomfortable, because of the back pocket in the seat in front of you. It is huge, it is sharp, it is right where my knee caps are and stuffed full of unnecessary advertisements and other stuff that no one needs. Food was good.

### "noticed the quality drop"
London to Bangkok via Abu Dhabi. My husband and I have been flying with Etihad for the past few years, we both noticed the quality drop year by year. This time was our last time to give it try, we have been on both economy cabin and business cabins with them many times. I'm mainly sharing the lounge service in this review, cause it's important for an airline to make a good first impression to their client. We were quite disappointed with Etihad, we will fly with different airline the next time. We flew from BKK - London Via Abu Dhabi, round trip. 18 Dec 2018 to London, Jan 6 2019 back in BKK. We were extremely disappointed by the lounge where Etihad assigned in BKK airport, EY407 departs from BKK to AUH at 01:55am, we got to the airport around 11pm, after pass security and everything, we wanted to go to the lounge for some rest, Etihad don't have their own lounge in BKK, they are just the normal Miracle Lounge which anyone can pay THB1000 to get in. The lounge was horrible, not enough seats, horrible food and service. So we started our trip with a bad taste, when reach AUH, this airport is always so messy, the lounge is ok at AUH since it's Etihad's hub. Now let's talk about check in and lounge at Heathrow. Even budget airlines in Asia has better service than Etihad, the check in was so bad that the business class counter staff are all not paying any attention or care to you, instead they were chatting and laughing. The lounge, ok Etihad lounge at Heathrow terminal 4, near gate 10 this lounge's service ranked the worst lounge on my list. The receptionist lady was super moody, didn't say hi or whatever, all servicing staff were gossipy while walking pass you, not trying to provide any help. The only good staff were the bartender who was trying to make some effort! Come on, Etihad, make some training to your staff! On board service at least is ok, food really is a so so though. Most of the food seemed been packaged a long time ago, not fresh at all. Time to move on, Etihad please do a better job!

### "bag arrived battered"
Not Verified |  Mumbai to London via Abu Dhabi. Our bag arrived battered and broken. Staff were not helpful in what we should do next. The staff at airport were not slick at checking in a group of seven people. They were more interested in checking if we had excess weight(we were not over the limit). I would suggest they train their check in staff better so that passengers feel that they are cared for, after all there is plenty of choice out there. The on line check in service was not working. They will need to work harder for my positive feedback.

### "not flying with them again"
Not Verified |  Toronto to Abu Dhabi. Found the boarding process very disorganized and the gate agents kept asking me about my India Visa despite on my previous passport and was told by the Indian Embassy that I can use my old passport to go to India with my current Passport. The flight left Toronto late but overall was OK but could improve by having the flight attendants go around the cabin with water, soft drinks and alcoholic drinks. The meals on the flight was OK but could have improved proper portion size. The price of the ticket was just ridiculous and had to pay for my seat on Etihad Airways and next time I'm not flying with them again.

### "Next trip I’ll be flying Qantas"
London to Melbourne via Abu Dhabi. I travel between London and Australia once to twice a year and Etihad were my preferred airline. I was given gold member status which one would think would result in something positive, instead I was met with a system that made me pay for the privilege of choosing a seat on my flight. What a funny way to reward your members. I pay for my flights then have to pay to choose a seat as a gold member. What’s the point in even having it. Next trip this year I’ll be flying Qantas.

### "One of the worst airlines"
Bangalore to Johannesburg via Abu Dhabi. One of the worst airlines in international travel. They don't have proper check in process. They hide all seats during web check in intentionally for you to buy them by paying extra. They will harrass to the maximum extent if your check in bag is 31 kg instead of 30 kg. They will make you stand in web check in queue for 3 hrs. No courtesy. They delay flights. Worst entertainment and seats.

### "wouldn't fly with them again"
Hong Kong to Manchester via Abu Dhabi. I had huge issues with online checkin. Couldn't select my seats and spent several hours being passed from one customer service rep to another. I was told to try the same thing again and again and after about three hours was told "sorry, nothing we can do". I had the same problem on the return flight, and just didn't even bother contacting them. They are also nit-picky about checked in baggage and carry on. The flights were fine, but I wouldn't fly with them again due to the incredibly poor customer service I received.

### "entertainment system is down"
Sydney to Muscat via Abu Dhabi. On 7th December I was on flight EY455 from Sydney to Abu Dhabi, with 8 bags for 4 Passengers, because the ticket say 2 PCs per passenger and didn't highlight the allowed weight. I called Etihad 2 weeks before flying and they confirmed max weight per bag is 23kg - 46kg per passenger. The lady at the airport team said it is only 30kg total per customer. However she said I know what you have been told wasn't right and didn't accept to provide any written confirmation that I am allowed only 30kg. Etihad Airways charged me almost $900 additional weight - I have to pay because there was no time to negotiate as the flight was about to close. Once we entered the aircraft the kids were choked to know that the entertainment system is down on the 14 hours flight! Etihad gave us a written document says we are eligible to 10K Etihad miles as compensation but we need to raise a complain - this is the process. However, after raising 4 complaints only one got closed and the remaining 3 are still under investigation for over a month now.

### "12.5 hours flight with full on aircon"
London to Melbourne via Abu Dhabi. This has been my worst ever experience with an airline, thanks to a defective airplane. Long story short, 12.5 hours flight with full on aircon is not a must have experience. Asked one of the cabin crew if we can adjust or dim down the aircon but got a negative answer in return. Result was babies crying all the time, people complaining for good reason, even had the quarantine members cone on board upon landing in Melbourne due to some passengers feeling ill.

### "Etihad did pull out all the stops"
I have flown with this airline for 10 years and when I started they were exceptional, in the last three years there was a definite dip in service but in the last year they have started to improve significantly - some routes are better than others. This was an emergency dash back to the UK as my father suffered a stroke and Etihad did pull out all the stops to get my ticket changed and get me the next available seat to see my father. I fly with Etihad long haul about 6 or 7 times a year. The improvement I see is in staff and the consumables at the seat and the general service level - staff moral is good. I have not traveled in Economy with Etihad for at least 5 years so I can only comment on the Business and First experience and that is much better than it was but not quite as good as I remember it to be before - still much better than other airlines I travel on. The staff were very kind and helpful on the Manila Abu Dhabi route as they always are.

### "has really declined in service"
Etihad Airways has really declined in service. I flew 6 months ago to Europe with them and they were very courteous and helpful. We even had our own sleep masks and toothbrush to make the whole journey a little more bearable. My only negative at the time was that my luggage had been damaged during transit and when I tried to follow up with them they had so many hurdles to try to jump through to make a claim that in the end it became too difficult to seek compensation whilst being abroad. 6 months later I chose to fly with them again as I was fairly happy with the service. However this time it was not a pleasant experience. There were no masks or toothbrushes on either flight. In fact we were lucky to even get headphones for the service. Someone came around to ask us if we wanted them and I apparently missed when this happened. The toilets were fairly dirty and smelly. The plane was also so hot that myself and several other passengers were trying to fan themselves throughout the flight. I could have flown on a much cheaper airline to have the same standards. I am not sure I will ever fly with Etihad again.

### "lousy customer service"
Manila to London via Abu Dhabi. Very disappointing and lousy customer service. Etihad Airways wouldn't credit my missing miles even if the oversight was on their part. I provided my Etihad Guest number upon check-in and it's clearly printed on my boarding passes. I didn't review my Activity History right away because I was confident that I provided my Etihad Guest number upon check-in and I trusted them to credit my miles accurately. I requested them to re-consider because again, the oversight was on their part, not mine. However, regardless of the number of times I followed up, they just kept giving me canned responses.

### "very rude and inconsiderate"
Chennai to Abu Dhabi. The flight was just for 4hours. I have travelled in several airlines before and this was my first time with Etihad. I do understand it's natural for air hostesses to lose their temper sometimes. But this person had been cranky all throughout the 4hours journey. She was very rude and inconsiderate of the passengers' reasonable needs. She could have just denied her service rather than speaking harshly and commenting condescendingly on the passenger. It's many such incidents in the same flight has lead me to write this bad review. Truly a disappointing service.

### "never fly with Etihad ever again"
Original ticket was from Chiang Mai to Bangkok and then from Bangkok to Abu Dhabi and Abu Dhabi to London. I booked my ticket many months in advance, Initiallly searched through Skyscanner and then through Go to Gate. After booking the ticket but before the flight I moved from Chiang Mai to Hua Hin. I assumed that as I had already paid for the Chiang Mai to Hua Hin flight it would be ok if I boarded at Bangkok to start the journey (I was wrong). When I arrived to check in at Bangkok I was informed by the check in clerk that all my tickets had been cancelled (including the return leg) because I did not board at Chiang Mai and if I wanted to travel I would have to pay a cancellation fee, an admin fee and pay to rebook all my tickets. I called the customer service desk at Etihad who told me that not only was the case but as my tickets were cancelled the plane at all stages was now full and I could not rebook onto my original flights (This was not true). This was told to me in a manner where the customer services clerk (on the phone) could hardly contain his eagerness to give me the bad news. I am a 73 years old pensioner travelling business class for the first time because of health reasons to visit my daughters and granddaughter for Christmas. I had already paid around 2,000 pounds for my ticket and now had to pay a further 1,500 pounds because I had missed a one hour internal flight. The money paid to rebook was money that I had set aside for Christmas presents and for holiday expenses. I was informed by the clerk that even if I had cancelled the internal flight all the other flights would also have been cancelled due to my booking having linked journeys and consequently it was classified as one ticket. I contacted Etihad to try to obtain a full or part refund but my request was denied. I wrote a letter (e mail) of appeal but that was not even acknowledged. I am totally disgusted and dismayed by Etihad and I will never fly with Etihad ever again.

### "Cabin crew need to smile"
Abu Dhabi to London. I like the colour scheme of cream and black. Leg room was ok. Annoyed with entertainment system being switched off 15mins before landing and being bombarded with adverts. Cabin crew need to smile. Food was so so. No menus given to let you know what food options are available. Breakfast was good as they had a pancake option. Seats did not recline very far compared to other airlines I've flown with. However great idea adding a side head rest.

### "Fairly old plane"
Phuket to Abu Dhabi. Fairly old plane. Leg room was ok. Etihad staff need to smile. No menu given so had no idea what was available to eat until the food cart came round. Food portions were small but tasted ok.

### "provided a good service"
Bangkok to London via Abu Dhabi. Etihad had a significant change since my last trip with them 6 years ago. The online check-in process won't allow me to check-in as I need to choose a seat which isn't free and I can't complete my check-in without choosing a seat. This means that I had to check-in at the airport on the day I travelled. The check-in progress was fairly fast as there was no queue at the airport and staff at the check-in counter choose a seat for me and my sisters for free as I need to took care them for a whole flight. Boarding progress was organized as the crew called passengers by zone. The aircraft on first leg (A330) was old but the cabin was modern and clean. The seat I sit was at the front on the middle of the aircraft which had terrible leg room and uncomfortable, luckily I sit on an aisle seat but still interrupted by people walking pass through. After take off, a meal was served and I choose chicken. There was 3 options but it could be better if the crew handed out the menu. The food was fine but the rice was sticky. The toilet on an aircraft was modern and well designed but wet and small. I sleep through this flight as i was an overnight flight and didn't have time to look on In-flight Entertainment. The flight was delayed and arrived at Abu Dhabi late which I had shorter connection time. The security control of the airport was a fast but crowded. As I don't have a second boarding pass I need to collect one from transfer desk but the staff at the line said I should head to gate as my flight to London start boarding. I collect my boarding pass (including my sisters) at the gate. The staff was helpful and professional but the progress was disorganized. I boarding on time into my second flight (A380) which had a modern and clean cabin. The seat was huge and got lots of legroom but still uncomfortable. The flight departed on time. The food on this flight is better than the previous one. The toilet is bigger but had the same issue as previous flight. The IFE had wide selections of films, TV shows, games etc. The crew was helpful, friendly and professional. Some stuff like amenity kit or little snack must be paid which I think it was unacceptable. The flight arrived at Heathrow on time at terminal 4 which is old and small. In conclusion, Etihad provided a good service on both flights but there still some areas of improvement to compete with major rivals.

### "happy with their service"
Johannesburg to Melbourne via Abu Dhabi. This was my first flight with Etihad and I was very happy with their service. Boarding and departures were on time. The pilots on both flights communicated really well, apologising for an 8min delay caused by air traffic control. Although the seats on their B787's are rather narrow and hard, the entertainment system is pretty much what you would expect.

### "Food was disgusting"
Singapore to Frankfurt via Abu Dhabi. Having water on a flight is a basic right for passengers, but was denied water while in this dilapidated Boeing 777-300 from Etihad. Cabin crew was too lazy to put water into my own water bottle, and told me that she would do in her way back - walked past me as if nothing happened. Same woman, for the second said again that she‘d get back to me - she was collecting rubbish and had water in trolley, again she didn’t. Finally got water, but was being served as if I was demanding for champagne. Food was disgusting.

### " online check in system is a fiasco"
Not Verified |  Paris to Sydney via Abu Dhabi. Etihad Airways online check in system is a fiasco. We attempted to check in including our son. On selecting seats, we were required to pay. The system didn’t recognise the seat selection so I tried again. Alas the credit card has been billed four times. Trying to talk to a human is impossible and the travel agent we used is no better. To top it off the flight information on the App is different to our booking.

### "spare seats to spread out onto"
Bangkok to London via Abu Dhabi. Boeing 777 to Abu Dhabi generally clean; on-time and half empty so plenty of spare seats to spread out onto. Few issues. Screens not very responsive for IFE and hard to navigate around strange menu selections. Screen on seat 55D cracked hence numerous sections not available. Only 11 Arabic films and not all with English subtitles. IFE turned off 30 minutes prior to arrival. Annoying advert prior to every video. Food fairly bland and only one food service offered on flight of over 6 hours ( a small packet of salty biscuits offered 1 hour prior to landing ). Plane did not arrive in AUH at an official stand and a bus was used. A380 AUH to LHR Significantly better than the first leg. Food better although second sitting of a so called sandwich was stodgy. IFE working at normal speed. Plane exceptionally clean. 95% occupancy on this leg.

### "ended up getting middle seat"
London to Bangkok via Abu Dhabi. Online booking is open 48 hours, where you can check-in but cannot select a seat. That can only done 24 hr before. However if you check 48-24 hrs before you will not be able to change the seat allocated at check-in. SO really if you want to choose your own seat, you should only check in 5-24 hrs before. Not clear at all when checking in. Secondly I could not check in for the connecting sector. I had to do it in stages within the time limits even though it was one booking, which I could not as I would have been travelling at that time because of the large waiting period. The passenger sitting next to me on the flight from London to Abu Dhabi was rather large and something needs to be done about this. I was uncomfortable (even though I am small) and she must have been too as I was only able to use 75% of my seat comfortably. My return trip's baggage allowance was 23kg, whereas it was 30kg going out. My error in not noticing this but it does seems rather banal and even ticketing my agent had not noticed because nobody drew his attention to it. I believe this should be not allowed unless it is pointed out clearly (in Bold) when booking. Lastly on my return while I was able to successfully check-in and select my seat on BKK-AUH sector, I could not just do it for the AUH-LHR sector, so I ended up getting middle seat, which I find difficult.

### "Refused a cup of water"
Manila to Riyadh via Abu Dhabi. To Abu Dhabi the attitude of the crew assigned in our cabin was condescending and looked being forced to do his job. Refused a cup of water even though I was already at the galley. Food was inadequate and seat too cramped.

### "do not choose this airline"
Jeddah to Toronto via Abu Dhabi. So this was my first and last flight with Etihad Airways, I was supposed to have a flight to Toronto at 10:05 am initially which got delayed to 7:30 pm, this was an absolute joke as the flight transfer desk took everyone’s passports to apply for a VISA to enter Abu Dhabi just to stay in a hotel, somehow this process which according to a member of the ground team was supposed to take a maximum of 3 hours, took 6 hours instead. There was literally a protest around one member of the ground team as it seems that Etihad Airways just are just too good at messing up such simple tasks it’s become part of their reputation, please do not choose this airline.

### "a pleasant flight"
Cairo to Dublin via Abu Dhabi. The security was tight at Cairo which is reassuring. It was a slow check-in process at Cairo. The lounge at Cairo used by Etihad was the Pearl lounge, which was fine and nice coffee and cakes plus hot food. A private booth chair and TV. The flight was after midnight and full. Nice staff but busy. Also nowhere to hang my overcoat as the wardrobe was full. Good service, good food and arrived on time into Abu Dhabi at 06:20. I made my way to the Lounge for my next flight to Dublin. I decided to take advantage of the Spa and had a massage of my back and feet. Great massage cost 30 - 40 euro. Took at least 40 minutes. Great way to spend your time between flights. I felt refreshed and had a glass of champagne before boarding my next flight. Again the flight was full and busy, but the staff were excellent. High quality food and wine. One problem I find with these pod type seats they're too restricted for my shoulders or to get comfortable in the flat bed position. They are fine for sitting up and eating. But the older style business class without pod seats are much more spacious and more comfortable then this walled in type seat. Other than that a pleasant flight. I arrived back in Dublin on time.

### "it has become a terrible airline"
Dublin to Abu Dhabi. My first time flying Etihad for a few years and it has become a terrible airline. No seat selection available, even at check-in, rude and surly cabin crew, poor catering (bring snacks), no amenities (not even a toothbrush on request). Flights depart on time, but it seems Etihad is now a budget airline with full service prices. Abu Dhabi airport is horrible and dirty.

### "would recommend this airline"
Not Verified |  Delhi to Los Angeles via Abu Dhabi. The first flight from Delhi to Abu Dhabi, the flight was great. The airline gave me an upgrade even though I've never flown with them before. Staff on board and on ground were very professional and helpful. Transfer at the Abu Dhabi airport was quick and painless. Staff was professional and helpful. 2nd flight from Abu Dhabi to Los Angeles I was in economy, no upgrade on this flight. The seat was pretty comfortable. Enough legroom, space to stretch legs; I'm 5'10 and I found it good enough. The seat itself was comfortable as well. The cabin crew made the flight painless, smiling and accommodating guests. When I asked for something they made sure I got it. Very professional. Etihad always highlight their premium cabins and products. So when booking a flight on Etihad, travelers expect that service and quality, but after booking the flight You can't select seats unless you pay for them. The flights seem to be overbooked, that leads to having no overhead luggage space, which is something you'd expect on a budget airline, not a premium airline. Also the cabin layout is very cramped and has incredibly small aisles, similar to a budget airlines. Overall I would recommend this airline.

### "experience only got worse"
Abu Dhabi to Toronto. I started flying with them in 2006 and became one of their first 800 gold members back then. Back then, it was obvious that the majority of the people I dealt with at Etihad did not care. They were among the worst airlines I flew with at multiple levels. They brag about new aircraft but nothing else. I stopped flying with them in 2009. Recently, I started flying with the them just because their tickets for my routes were the cheapest. I made it to Gold again this year but unfortunately, if anything, the airline staff, policies, and overall experience only got worse, if that is even possible. I can't start to describe the lack of courtesy they show to their guests, and continuous lies they keep making. They really do not need to think out of the box, their neighbors in Dubai run a very successful airline. They just need to copy them! Frequent travelers are never made to feel special, and their loyalty program hardly offers any benefits.

### "No one cares"
Not Verified |  I purchased a ticket from Etihad Airways to fly from Sydney to Melbourne then to Abu Dhabi, Etihad has partnered with Virgin Australia to carry us. So my flight from Sydney got delayed I miss my flight from Melbourne to Abu Dhabi, so Virgin said it’s not their problem and I must talk to Etihad - and Etihad said Virgin delayed it is their problem. Virgin gave me a one night hotel in Melbourne and booked my flight three days later with a waiting period of 10 hours between flights. I pay the rest of the 2 days from my pocket and my holiday is cut in half. No one cares.

### "had to pay the applicable fee"
On 29 August 2018, I purchased a business lass ticket on Etihad to travel Manila to London with departure on 5 November at 5h55 pm and London to Manila with departure on 19 November. On 18 October, I called Etihad to have the ticket changed to Manila to Rome with departure on 5 November at 5h55 and unchanged return from London. For that change I was charged USD 209, which seems reasonable. On 5 November, my connecting flight to Manila, bought separately on Cebu Pacific, was cancelled due to heavy rains. I called Etihad and agreed with the Customer service that my ticket would be changed to “open”, as it was uncertain, when I would reach Manila. I arrived at Etihad’s check-in counter on 5 November at 9 pm. There I was told that I had two options for rebooking. I could travel departing Manila on 5 November at 11 pm, or the next day. In either case, the charge for changing my booking would be more than USD 2000, a few 100 USD less, if I would take the flight on 6 November. I decided to opt for departing on 5 November at 11 pm. For this change, I was charged USD 2594.70 plus USD 20. I accepted the charge, only expressing my surprise, because there was no time to lose to catch the flight departing at 11 pm. After my return, I received by email a questionnaire asking me to rate Etihad based on my travel experience. I of course gave the lowest rate. The system asked, if I wanted to submit a complaint, so I did that. The response from Etihad “Guest relations” was: “I have reviewed your booking to check the specific rules for your ticket, and can see the ticket you purchased was priced for firm travel dates. This was highlighted clearly during the ticket purchase process. As a result, your ticket is not applicable for a free waiver on your booked flights. Upon your call and request to exchange your ticket to the new chosen dates you had to pay the applicable fee and fare difference.” I replied pointing out that there had not been any change of date: I left Manila on 5 November and arrived Madrid on 6 November. Through several emails I requested a proper explanation for the very high charge. In response I received the following message from Etihad “Guest relations”: “Thank you for your reply. In my previous email I had explained you in detail, when you exchange your ticket to another date or flight that the applicable fare difference and change penalty fee needs to be paid. The fare rules of your originally purchased ticket were disclosed to you at the time of booking and send to you in a confirmation email. Unfortunately I am unable to reimburse you for the fees you had to pay.” Thus, a polite request for an explanation of extraordinarily high charge for changing a ticket is met with an explanation, which is not valid, being based on the incorrect postulate of change of date.

### "The app is a joke"
Frankfurt to Abu Dhabi. The app is a joke and trying add or reserve a seat is impossible. You can’t even add your points you have to do it on the webpage. The flight was horrible I have felt more comfortable on AirAsia planes. How this company has a good reputation is amazing. I will do my very best to fly any other airline than this one.

### "bottom of the list option"
Sydney to Cairo via Abu Dhabi. Checkin experience was the worst with Dnata. I told them as an Etihad guest for years I'm entitled for an extra weight allowance, the rude guy said you are a back seat member and not entitled for that. I told him on a previous flight I got the extra weight as a member and offered him the flight details but he neglected that and insisted on charging me $444. On board Etihad are no longer providing meals menu, they just ask you chicken or lamb?! Etihad as well no later providing a personal pack with Socks etc. The seat was not comfortable at all although it was an exit seat. The cabin crew seems to be less engaging and kind of avoiding or paying minimal attention. I had a similar experience while flying business class with Etihad last year, it less disappointing though. Etihad is definitely bottom of the list option.

### "Worst business class flight"
London to Abu Dhabi. Worst business class flight ever taken. Screaming/crying children in Business class cabin for whole flight. Chicken meal was inedible. Lounge full of crying children. Staff did nothing to rectify complaints at time. They just said anyone can buy a seat in any cabin. Etihad seems to want to provide a flying creche service rather than a suitable environment / service for actual business travellers.

### "need to get serious with their jobs"
I traveled with my family on 19th December from Mombasa through Nairobi to Abu Dhabi. It was a long and tiring flight. We carried along five baggages. We were the last to collect our baggage inspite of having priority privileges. We later realized one baggage was missing. I reported this at the lost baggage counter whereby i was given a small note and promised that they have traced it and will send it to the hotel in Dubai where we were staying in the next 24hrs. It has now gone beyond one week. My kids have no clothes to change to and this has forced us to spend money out of our budget to buy few clothes for them. Attempts to call the airline as well as sending email seemed futile. Email not answered and airline taking no responsibility with people tossing us from one office to another. This is being very unfair. I now intend to travel to Abu Dhabi from Dubai to resolve the matter leaving my kids in the hotel. What a time waste. Officials from the airline need to get serious with their jobs. I have travelled many places in the world and this has never happened. What a shame!

### "never flying this company again"
New York to Mumbai via Abu Dhabi. I am never flying with Etihad Airways again. I am giving Etihad a 2/10 because of their inability to properly handle my baggage. I paid almost $2000 to fly from New York to Mumbai (return trip), and the least I expect is to have my checked-in baggage reach along with me (as anyone would expect). Butthis is not what happened. I checked-in two bags at JFK, but only one of them made it to Mumbai. I was told the other one was stuck in Abu Dhabi. Another staff member told me that it seems that it is still at JFK airport. The tracking number they gave me did not work either (it kept showing “tracking continues”- all in all, an utterly useless response). There have been 6 additional flights from Abu Dhabi to Mumbai after I arrived and yet my bag seems to be nowhere near me. As I am writing this review, it has been nearly 36 hours since I arrived and yet my bag can not be tracked. I have come home to see my family and friends for 2 weeks (after a year of being away) and my short vacation is being ruined because I am constantly anxious about my luggage and am fearing the worst. I suspect that Etihad staff at some point (either at JFK or Abu Dhabi) was negligent and left didn’t load my luggage. It is beyond infuriating to know that even after paying $2000, this is the kind of treatment a customer receives. It’s 2018. We have sent humans to the moon and beyond, and yet this incompetent company called Etihad Airways has failed to successfully deliver my baggage to me. I have recommended Etihad Airways to my friends and family in the past because they usually have comfortable flights and good food. But, this incident is unacceptable to me. I shall be avoiding Etihad Airways completely and will never be flying with this company again.

### "impossible to get through to Etihad"
My wife and I travelled from Australia to Rome return, via Etihad's hub in Abu Dhabi. As we had discovered on the earlier sectors it is not unusual for Etihad to split up families even when they are booked together, we had paid the roughly 40 Euros to grab a couple of seats in a twin row, so that we would have aisle access for the six hour plus Abu Dhabi to Sydney sector. (there are no free seat selection options). I also placed a NZD195 bid on a neighbour free seat on the understanding that should the bid be successful we would forfeit our 40 Euros. And then, with just on twenty-four hours till check-in I was emailed that our bid for the neighbour free seat NFS had been successful. So far so good! Upon boarding at Abu Dhabi we were surprised to find that the entire economy section appeared full. These extra bookings must have occurred during the twenty-fours hours immediately prior to take off, (who would have imagined) for them to have accepted my (minimum) bid for a NFS. The hostess was pleasant enough and checked all the seating allocations and the passengers were all in their correct seats, and our two originally selected seats were also allocated. (not to us) OK, so stuff happens sometimes! Now I imagined that I should be entitled to a refund of my NZD195 as I had not received a NFS and the 40 Euro seat selection charge as we hadn't received those either. And this is when the fun started, it is all but impossible to get through to Etihad. The one call I successfully made to our nearest call centre (in Australia from New Zealand) I received advice to email. Emails received replies to leave messages on Facebook. Messages left on Facebook received automatic responses that I should expect replies within twenty eight days. So, here we are more than a month after the flight, still waiting for Etihad to respond. Interesting note: Etihad's Facebook page is full of complaints from people who have unresolved complaints. Next time, before I choose an airline to send my money to, I will check their Facebook page for an up to date idea of their service / customer relations rather than a year old survey.

### "will not travel Etihad again"
Not Verified |  London to Brisbane via Abu Dhabi. My daughter and I travelled from Brisbane to London in economy and returned a week later. The aircraft we travelled in were a Boeing 787 and an Airbus A380. Firstly, the 787 is a simple yet beautiful aircraft and the layout seemed adequate for a 14 hour flight. The seats are comfortable and offer a great recline. The in-flight entertainment was adequate if nothing extraordinary and was enough to keep a nine year old and a 40 year old entertained for a total of 40 or so hours flying. The A380 was in my opinion slightly more comfortable and appeared to have more room. My issue with Etihad is not with the aircraft however it is with the additional costs. I have flown over the years extensively with airlines such as QANTAS, British Airways, Singapore Airlines, Cathay Pacific, Korean Air, KLM and Garuda Indonesia. On these airlines, I have never, room permitting, been requested to pay USD$330 for my daughter and I to experience greater leg room in an exit row. In fact on the aforementioned ‘other’ airlines I have in fact been offered a seat with greater leg room (I am a tall man) or upon request, room permitting have been allocated a roomier seat. I have come to expect, despite the fact that I am an economy passenger, that these small but meaningful gestures from an airline and their staff are a standard when it comes to flying on a premium airline. The service was inconsistent. Some okay, some kind of interested and others seemingly annoyed by your presence. Don’t expect any initiative of any sort. Etihad has proven me wrong. I pre-selected my seats using the Etihad app which I was prompted to do on numerous occasions before all flights. I did select my economy seats however was told at check in that For whatever reason, the seats that I had selected were not the seats I had been allocated. I was however informed that for £490 I could ‘upgrade’ to exit row seats for both flights home. I politely declined and politely exclaimed how ridiculous the suggestion was. After a 6.5 hour flight from London and facing a 13.5 hour flight to Brisbane, my daughter and I had 45 minutes to negotiate Abu Dhabi’s security checks with a thousand other people all massed together like Sardines. Then rushed to our connecting flight and discovered that we were wedged in to another tight row crowded with similarly discontented passengers. I gave in and paid a total of $443 AUD to have my daughter and I seated in an exit row aisle. I will not travel Etihad again. I will happily pay three or four hundred extra dollars and fly with a carrier that doesn’t pretend to be classy but just is.

### "A pretty enjoyable flight"
Bahrain to Melbourne via Abu Dhabi. One thing that needs to be addressing I feel based on both flights & is a dangerous precedent that seems to be on the increase is the continued use of mobiles phones whilst taking off and landing. My first flight from Bahrain to Abu Dhabi on take off had a guy who was still talking on his mobile phone, even after the normal warnings issued by the crew! Then landing you can see folk starting texting and this was so evident on both flights. This is safety violations but as the crew are already in their seats none of them can see what’s going on in the cabin. The use of mobiles on take off & landing must be enforced & not one crew member is doing anything to stop what is becoming an epidemic on the most dangerous part of a flight take off & landing... apart from this observation both crews were attentive and one crew member on The Melbourne flight  from Serbia deserves special mention as she did take great care of me even if I slept most of the flight. Makes a nice change when a crew member makes a great effort & goes above the normal of what’s expected from a crew member. Need more of her type in the skies. The IFE seems to have improved as a lot better choice of films were very evident so Etihad must keep it up. WiFi need big improvement inflight though as connection just keeps getting disconnected many times. A pretty enjoyable flight this time around though.

### "last flight with Etihad"
Dublin to Brisbane via Abu Dhabi booked for December 2018. Worst Customer Service Center I have  dealt with. My parents fly with Etihad Airways every year to Australia. Called customer service last August for my elderly parents who were trying to keep their air miles. They couldn’t fly last year due to health reason but in july 2017 they wanted to book Dec 2018 in order to save their airmiles. There was no flights available as it was too far out. When we explained it, we were told there was nothing we could do. Sept this year my mom gets a call from Etihad that she answered on her hands free as she was driving. She was told that they cancelled her return flight back to the UK and would she accept another flight back. She cooperated and said yes only to find out that the details of the new flight means she has to get a taxi to airport $90 and a hotel. She was quite distraught. I called and explained to be told that she agreed, therefore there was nothing that she could do. I asked to speak to a manager. I got a call from a supervisor. She couldn’t help, so I asked to speak to a manager. I was told on Sept 20th that a manager would call me and still haven’t heard from them. After complaining I was promised another call at 2pm. I then received an email at 3:20pm stating they couldn’t reach me. 3.5months later still trying to talk to a manager. This is my parents last flight with Etihad.

### "denied entry to the lounge"
Not Verified |  I am a gold member of Etihad and my husband is platinum. We live in Abu Dhabi really do not have any alternative to using this airline even though Etihad never fails to surprise me in the myriad of weird and wonderful ways it can think of to treat its customers badly and this flight was no surprise. I booked my ticket on the Etihad website; it had an Etihad flight number EY7854; I paid my money to Etihad. Then, we were not able to select a seat or check in online. So we went to Abu Dhabi airport early to select seats together and to enjoy dinner and a drink in the first class lounge only to find we were denied entry to the lounge because it was not an Etihad operated flight, but Middle East Airlines! We were told this was due to some contract between Etihad and MEA and that the information was available on the website (not true). When we left and were about 4 yards away, I turned around and saw that the lounge manager and door attendant were laughing at us - we are repeat customers - we are travelling again in December, January and February. Etihad do not let their customers, loyal or otherwise, ever have a win. You cannot select a seat in advance without paying about 1/3 of the original price extra even if you are a gold or platinum frequent flyer; they will separate you and your husband when it comes to their seat allocation; you only get one meal on the flight and that is served at inappropriate times so that if you have a flight of over 4 hours you arrive hungry; and all of this is on top of the creaky old planes with their ugly brown livery and small, narrow seats with minimum leg room. I don't know why anyone ever chooses Etihad.

### "on a race to the bottom"
Bahrain to Diblin via Abu Dhabi. I have been loyal to this airline for over 10 years now , Having been a gold member for many years, whilst once this airline was a leader it is now sadly on a race to the bottom. This race is not just the hard product but the soft product. Staff who need to be retrained from their appalling call centre to the Etihad guest program that is now a farce. Again another 8 phone calls to their call centre 5 I was hung up on within the first sentence to three others who placed me on hold for over 10 minutes to revert with a price on change to my ticket for the return leg, a Flex ticket to be told three different prices, all of which were higher that the original ticket being a ticket cost 1300 Eur to then ask for 1400 Euro for date change. While checking their website a brand new return ticket in the same class would cost me 900 euro. The mind boggles how this is calculated. Etihad need to get your act together. This combined with trying to have your miles credited correctly ever time you take a flight.

### "IFE is markedly substandard"
Bangkok to Abu Dhabi. Good: Check-in open at least 4 hours prior to the flight. Not busy, efficiently processed and retired to the generic airport lounge used by Etihad for shower and change of clothes though somewhat lacking in facilities otherwise; very limited choice of food particularly for vegetarians and vegans. Flight not that busy, empty seat alongside which makes a big difference. Staff friendly and swiftly dealt with a conflict over seating without making a drama; a largish family group determined to take matters into their own hands to ensure they all sat together irrespective of the allocated seats. Drinks immediately served on departure followed by the meal - a vegetarian option for myself. Arrival in Abu Dhabi a few minutes ahead of schedule. Not so good: The aircraft was one of, if not the oldest 777 in the Etihad fleet and did it show. The brown interior decor favoured by Etihad never looked great but is now hopelessly dated and compares poorly to other airlines. There was no live TV available; generally Etihad's IFE is markedly substandard in comparison to other airlines, including low-cost carriers. Very disappointing on what should be a flagship long-haul service. Whether this was a function of the aircraft's age or a change of policy is not known, Likewise poor show for the failure of the crew to recognize that I'm a Gold Card holder. Finally, there is the near obligatory delight of being crammed into a bus for the grand tour of the wilds of Abu Dhabi airport on arrival - at least the buses turned up this time, unlike a previous occasion. So doing simply undermines the positive impression of the service offered at the departure airport.

### "Never flying this airline again"
Not Verified |  Never flying with this airline again. Not only have I been ripped off incredibly by paying over $2000 AUD for a return flight (paid in October 2017), for seat check in, I needed to pay for the seat reservation. Are you kidding me? This was never something I needed to do with this airline. Also, on my way to Jordan (back in June 2018), I was not told about the recent luggage allowance change from 30 to only 23, which came into effect Jan this year. I was only 1.5kgs over by accident and the rude lady at the counter charged me 2kg excess. Why not charge only for 1.5kg? Why round it up? Couldn’t she have just given me a break and either round down to 1lg excess or none at all? Absolutely fuming at this airline carrier. Not recommending or flying with them ever again.

### "Excellent service"
Bangkok to London via Abu Dhabi (return leg) on 28 November 2018. Economy class. The flight from Bangkok to Abu Dhabi (Boeing 777-300) was in my estimation no more than 75% full and took off within a few minutes of the scheduled departure time; arrived on time. Excellent service from the ground staff and from the flight crew on the plane. Liquid refreshments (both alcoholic and non-alcoholic) served regularly during the flight. Food was "satisfactory" although not as good as it was when I last flew Etihad six years previously (it was then outstanding). Entertainment availability was fine although more restricted than on some of the other Middle East airlines. Airport facilities at Abu Dhabi (both seating accommodation and available shopping facilities) much improved according to my recollection. From Abu Dhabi to London Heathrow (Airbus A380 - world's best aircraft for passenger experience, in my opinion) the flight appeared to be very close to fully booked and departure was delayed for around 30 minutes to allow boarding by passengers from a connecting flight that had been delayed - this a positive rather than a negative feature to my mind. Arrival at London was nevertheless on time to within a few minutes. My return to Etihad was largely as a result of the extremely competitive price offered for the (return) flight ticket. If the pricing and standard of service can be maintained I foresee that Etihad will become and remain my airline of choice for the time being.

### "planes being half empty"
Not Verified |  This was my first flight with Etihad Airways from Brisbane to Rome via Abu Dhabi. November isn’t high season in Europe and one can only hope that long haul international flights aren’t full. Each of my Etihad flights were fantastic due mainly to the planes being half empty. All economy passengers had either a row to themselves or at least a spare seat in between each other. My husband and sons each flew different Etihad flights from Brisbane to Rome in November and experienced the same. Also, the interconnecting flights were less than two hours. The meals are small but tasty enough served with complimentary alcoholic beverages. Super impressed and highly recommend Etihad in low season.

### "never fly with Etihad again"
Islamabad to Melbourne via Abu Dhabi. Not very good experience for long flight economy class passenger. Very small aircraft for long flight of more than 13 hours, over packed flight. Abu Dhabi airport very disappointing in terms of longer transit, pathetic duty free. Food on flight was below average. However flight crew was active and kind. Have travelled from Islamabad to Melbourne then back from Sydney to Islamabad. Although from Sydney it was A380,but again overbooked flight! Economy class not very comfortable. Will never fly with Etihad again, very small aircraft, poor food, no free internet on flight and unimpressive duty free!

### "Most horrid experience"
Toronto to Bangalore via Abu Dhabi. Most horrid experience. The food was lousy, salad on both sectors was frozen pieces of vegetables. Cucumber on the onward journey and corn on the return journey. Kept asking the staff for hot water and they kept saying they will come back and they never showed up. This happened not once or twice but 3 times so much so that I gave up asking for it. Counter staff in BLR made a fuss about 1 kilo of excess weight on the hand baggage. I never want to fly with them ever. Better to use the European airlines as the experience is much better.

### "The price is amazing"
The price is amazing. We have a return flight from Moscow To Narita Tokyo via UAE. The price for business class ticket for 6 person was incredible. The flight on A320 was nice, the entertainment was not the best, I mean the screens, it was little bit slow, so the entertainment was not as good as on A321 on the return flight. The female Arabian staff was not as welcoming as male or international. Food is perfect, some Russian dishes as a desert, stay in Abu Dhabi was ok, good lounge, the best part was the Boeing 787-9 business class seat, the privacy is amazing, best food, incredible entertainment, really nice mood-light, massage function, nice lavatories.

### "business class is appalling"
Appalling food, absent staff and stinking toilets in business class - never again. We flew Business Class from Sydney to Casablanca via Abu Dhabi. We were looking forward to experiencing a flight on Etihad. As frequent travellers we like to try different airlines. The reality was horrible. Really bad food - on the really long journey I was served an egg white omelet on the first flight and some appalling canned pumpkin soup on the 2nd leg. No other food was offered. The staff seemed to spent most of the flight gossiping in the galley oblivious to passengers. By the time I was dumped into the awful waiting room at Casablanca airport I was hungry. The wines were not up to business class standard. The seat was uncomfortable - ditto with the 'bed' and the amenities pack sub-standard. The worst aspect of both flights were the stinking toilets. They really smelt bad. Please can someone get into the toilets with hot soapy water and disinfectant and clean them? Is this too much to expect in a business class cabin? I have written to Etihad to complain as we are dreading the return trip. I got a response full of business jargon - a response which completely ignored my customer experience. Once Etihad has the customer's money, they just don't care. Their business class service is appalling and not worth the money.

### "worst experience ever"
Los Angeles to Cairo Abu Dhabi. My worst experience ever. Will never fly again on Etihad and will never recommend to anybody. Service is very bad. Food spicy and does note taste good. Aircraft smells bad and bathroom flooded. Missed flight and spoke to customer service who promised to book me on next day flight with out fees. But as usual, They do not keep promises.

### "Overall flight was good"
Johannesburg to Frankfurt via Abu Dhabi. Overall flight was good. Schedule was respected and interior quite new. Plane was silencious. Light atmosphere was in line with the good practices of the other companies. Even if I am tall (1.95m), the existing seat space was correct for the flight duration (8h + 6h). Good inflight entertainment. Meals were ok in terms of quantity/quality. Tickets price was the lowest I have ever seen for long haul flights! Some points to be noted: IFE was shut down 1h before landing and earphones collected directly (is that the purpose?). It is not the case on the other airlines. Every time a passenger or a kid call the steward via the button it rings very loud on speaker or headphones. Staff was professional but not specially friendly. Too much plastics used for glasses for the different services (water, dinner, break etc).

### "Etihad Airways was the worst"
I was impressed how disrespectful EY6 October 4th morning flight Munich to Abu Dhabi attendant was. I never met who’s acting like that. Especially one, starting with her face expressions when I asked for a beer during snack service she started gossip with other member about me in front of me and pointing finger towards to me in their own language. You somehow starting feel guilty that you bought a ticket to that flight. And during hot meal service she looked at me and just ignored me, later on another flight attendant came and asked what do I prefer. During my journey I flew with 6 different airlines and I must say that Etihad Airways was the worst. Turkish Airlines and Qatar Airways was way more better. Instant noodles and cheese sandwich for 10 hour flight - seriously?

### "lost a loyal business class passenger"
We wanted to stay over in Abu Dhabi for a couple of nights and indeed Etihad push this on their website. Initially, when we tried to book this stopover the price of the flights had gone up which meant a flight difference fee in addition to the change fee. The agent then advised us to wait and to see if the fare dropped so we could match what we paid. It did, and so we rang Etihad to book our stopover. We were genuinely shocked to be told that to change the one leg of our flight would cost an incredible €2,300 each! We were fully aware that there would be a change fee, no issue there. But to be told that our ticket would be cancelled and new ticket issued was ridiculous. This just cannot be correct. However, I recieved a call from Etihad and the agent said the fees to change were correct. No wonder Etihad are in trouble because now I am on for Emirates/Qatar/Turkish and Etihad have lost a loyal business class passenger.

### "book any airline except Etihad"
Not Verified |  Flew Abu Dhabi to Mumbai. 1) Terrible customer service. 2) They overbook the flight and then throw rules on your face. Will re-book you on any flight without your consent. 3) If you want to be absolutely sure that you want get to your destination on the designated date and time, book any airline except Etihad. They will simply wreck you day, your flight and your peace of mind. Book this airline if they are the only ones left in this world. Pricey and least customer friendly.

### "suite was spacious"
Abu Dhabi to New York in November 2017. This was the best airline hard product I've experienced. The suite was spacious and luxurious, exactly the way it was advertised. I liked the fact that it offered separate seat and bed, though the bed was not as comfortable as the one on Singapore Airlines suite. There was a bar and shower facility on board, but I did not use any of them as I slept and ate most of the 14-hour flight. Catering and service was excellent, though were not as polished as Singapore Airlines.

### "unprofessionalism and inhuman behaviour"
Abu Dhabi to Manchester. This was quite a modern flight with inflight entertainment, clean and charging points. We paid online for preferred seats as we were traveling with Kids and an elderly lady. Our seat allocation was six in a row. (3 in the right wing and 3 in the Isle). However when we boarded the flight the front 3 seats were vacant where my kids were seated, and therefore for easy communication I requested to move to the vacant seat(both in the Economy class) after it was announced that the flight was about to take off. However a member of the cabin crew mentioned that the passengers are still boarding and they will have to see whether the seat would fall vacant (I was surprised). However after I heard the final announcement that the flight was to take off, I moved to the seat in front where the kids were seated because I was sure that the doors were closed. I was then taken again by surprise when another crew member came and insisted me to get back to my original seat and I would be given the first preference if no passenger has booked that seat(strange how the passengers could enter with closed doors). However the flight took off with the seats still vacant but after about 25 minutes a passenger came right from the back and occupied the seat that I was promised first preference. I thought this was purely impartial treatment to prove a point by purely displaying unprofessionalism and inhuman behaviour the the crew members. To mention few of the other comments; Commercials are played over the public address system - this is not a sponsored journey so please respect others freedom of listening as it is not a safety announcement. No meal preference card in seat pockets or distributed to passengers before meals are served, being a full service flight. Entertainment choices are almost same across all sectors.

### "not a children friendly airline"
Abu Dhabi to Colombo. Out of the four sectors flown, this cabin crew was the best. They were more professional than the other sectors. However, this is not a children friendly airline. When meals were served, I don't know why we were served with vegetarian meals. My kid were a sleep and I requested that their meals to be served later which we were flatly refused. So the kids travelled all the way to Colombo without a meal.

### "Not a children friendly flight"
Manchester to Abu Dhabi. This sector was not available for online preferred seats (paid seats) The seats were allocated 2x3 rows for six passengers where three seats were available in the sector. These were system allocated seats. I called the Etihad office in Manchester to change this in to three in a row since we were traveling with Kids. Although the call center officer tried her best to help me, she said I have to get them from the Airport and it should not be an issue. When we reached the Airport we were dissapointed with the attitude of the Ground staff, where the checkin counter officer was rushing us to check in the baggage warning us the counter would be closed in 10 minutes and we would be off loaded (we had 1hr and 20 minutes at this point before departure) This looked like a scam to earn additional money from passengers who are over weight. Since we had little choice to rearrange our baggage, Out of desperation I paid for 5 additional kgs and left two baggages behind. We wouldn't have been over weight if we were not refused a Cabin luggage, mentioning it was oversized to go in as cabin luggage, although it was in the allowed cabin baggage allowance. I wonder why they did not allow the kilos that we were allowed in the refused cabin luggage to be checked in, since they refuse the baggage to be taken in the cabin. Also I was surprised how the same piece of baggage survived two sector belonging to the same Airline when we travelled to Manchester. It was very disappointing to see the treatment of the the other ground staff officer, rushing us to get to the boarding gate although we were traveling with an elderly lady. Finally I had to tell him that I made a request online for Wheel chair assistance where it was never offered to the passenger at check in. When we arrived at the gate, the passengers were still queued up. What was the mighty rush my the so call ground staff officer"? The biggest drama was when we boarded the Aircraft. It was hot like a sauna. Most of the lockers were full and I ask one of the cabin crew where could I keep the baggage and she replied "The flight is full" with a don't care attitude and just walked away. At that point a kind passenger was helping me to sort out my baggage. When I opened one of the lockers, the cabin member came back and said "it is understood that the lockers are closed because they are full" 'Oh Really" that was news to me having, flown for several years. However the kind passenger (mentioned above)helped me out to sort out my baggage. Since the heat was unbearable, my wife pressed the button for assistance to get some water, but no crew member turned up. But soon I realised that we were not alone since I saw three more illuminated lights calling for assistance where no cabin member turned up. The flight took off around 8.45 PM. Around 9.45 pm we were served with some savoury biscuits (savoury biscuits at that time of the night?) Finally when the Dinner was served, it was 11.15 PM. At least the kids were not served meals on time. Few points to note to the benefit of other passengers- Although this is a long sector only 23kg allowed in Economy. Not a children friendly flight. If you are traveling with children and elderly people, avoid this flight as it is very unlikely that you will get any kind of assistance from the cabin crew. Should also mentioned that the seats were not adjustable although a button exist to do so.

### "Terrible customer service"
Madrid to Kuala Lumpur via Abu Dhabi. The 20th October I was going to fly from Madrid to Denpasar, and I said "I was going to" because the crew was so overwhelmed with the overbooking in the flight that could not attend everyone properly and let me out of the flight. I waited in the queue more than an hour (they had to open more desks as otherwise they wouldn't be on time to close the flight). First person I talked to ask for a flight that shows I am leaving Bali within a month, I completely understand that legally you need it but I explained them I have lived in Bali for 4 years (I showed them all my working permits and stamps) and I am waiting for a new working permit (also you can extend your visa at airport until 60 days so this could be also an option, but not). This person pass me with the manager, I have to wait as she is talking with other passengers, I don't understand why everyone is so tense, crew and passengers but I wait until there is a space for me. After explaining her the same she still requires the ticket and send me to buy it to the front (AirEuropa), they were also busy so I waited, when they were free they told me they don't fly to Bali and can not help me, why do you send me to AirEuropa then? I ended up buying the ticket online close to the crew of Etihad, they knew what I was doing, and when I received the confirmation they said the flight was closed and that i am not considered overbooking like another 5 people because I had no my flight in time. This was the worst treat I ever had, they were so overwhelmed because the company sold more seats than what they should. I followed every step they told me, they knew I was buying the ticket, they knew I live here in Bali and need to fly and still let me out, shameless. When they realised how bad they treated me and how unfair they were, they try to fix it and, of course, Madrid approved to reissue the ticket for the next day, when they were on it the central did not let them reissue, did they even listened to what happened at the airport? I called customer services several times just to be told I have to pay the change plus the no show fee, again, shameless, 500 euros. I ended up buying a new ticket as I would not accept a no show in this situation. Another 580 euros because the airline was too busy to attend properly to the passengers. The day after the crew apologised but nothing else they can do. I already claimed twice and did not even have an answer from them. Terrible customer service, terrible attitude.

### "going through such bad times?"
Delhi to London via Abu Dhabi. The seating policy is too bad. I understand that all the airlines have started charging for some seats if we want to select them beforehand but once the check-in opens, other airlines that I have flown allow us to select them. I flew from Abu-Dhabi to London on 23rd October and we were not able to select exit or bulkhead seats. Once inside the aircraft, we saw that the seats were vacant, so requested the crew if I could move there and was denied. Some other passengers also requested to be moved but were denied. When I was flying from London to Abu Dhabi, I went to the galley and asked if I could have some crisps or peanuts as was still hungry. The lady crew member tells me that I have to pay if I wanted to have anything else. Is Etihad going through such bad times?

### "very pleasant experience"
Washington to Bangalore via Abu Dhabi. First time flyer with Etihad Airways. The smaller aircraft with fewer passengers provides more individual attention from the cabin crew. The transfer from aircraft to terminal in Abu Dhabi was in a bus. More comfortable arrangements can be made for Business Class passengers. Ground transportation from airport to the hotel and return was well arranged and comfortable in a limo. Ample selection of food and beverages provided on the flight. Very impressive cabin crew, courteous and friendly. Seat comfort was good but could be more plush. Overall, a very pleasant experience.

### "not fly Etihad ever again"
Frankfurt to Brisbane via Abu Dhabi. Awful impolite crew. I had to ask for water several times. It was an overnight flight which arrived in the evening in Brisbane so I didn't want to sleep because of jetlag & work next morning. The crew didn't like that & ignored my request that I had to go to the galley myself to receive water. Not enough immigration cards for all passengers. When I complained they gave some to other passengers the cards & totally ignored me even they had some more left later. I asked politely again & was told to organise it at airport. Food was below average. Booking system is worth & you have to pay extra for seats ($50+ per leg) so it sums up to not low air fare anyway. So many other airlines are cheaper & offer excellent service, food & entertainment. Will not fly Etihad ever again.

### "food tasty and plentiful"
Manchester to Kuala Lumpur via Abu Dhabi. Booked flights to with Etihad simply on price. My daughter had used them several years ago and had nothing but praise. From the moment I boarded till the moment I left both flights, the service, food and aircraft were excellent. The seats were a little hard, but not uncomfortable and the entertainment system is somewhat lacking. The cabin crew did regular drink rounds with a smile and the food tasty and plentiful.

### "Extremely uncomfortable seats"
Madrid to Abu Dhabi. The cabin crew service was good and that is about the only positive for this 7 hour flight. Extremely uncomfortable seats in this aging aircraft. If you recline you cant get get out as there is no space and these seats are not worth the ticket price. We had flown to Madrid on the Boeing 787 which definitely had better seats. The food selection looked good but the quality was lacking. The Chicken Biryani was over-spiced ginger chicken pieces on boiled yellow rice - nothing even close to what a biryani should be. My partner had the Pumpkin Pasta which turned out to be under cooked. The Passion Fruit meringue was on a stone hard base. A very disappointing experience. The toilets on the rear side of the cabin had this foul smell. In the B777 the Business Class experience is not worth the price you pay.

### "Etihad was a big let down"
Abu Dhabi to Amsterdam and I can say that Etihad was a big let down, an utter failure when it comes to customer service. I have already checked in and chose my seat (window seat) online but when I showed up at the airport to drop my bags and get my boarding pass the check in lady changed my seat into an aisle seat (she didn't even bother to notify me) and to my surprise I didn't know until I reached the airplane and staff directed me to my new seat - that was the first thing that made me frustrated. In addition to that the cabin crew were really impolite and they kept hitting my shoulder as they were walking down the aisle and they didn't even bother to say sorry until I told one of them 'Hey watch it, this is the 3rd time you hit my shoulder' then he looked at me and continued walking? It was a morning flight so breakfast was served and I'm happy as hell that I ate from McDonald's Abu Dhabi airport before I board the plane - the breakfast Etihad served was so atrocious. The in-flight entertainment was mostly old movies and the alcohol served was mainly cheap brands - bconsidering how expensive Etihad flights are in general (around 1000 dollars for an economy seat yet they provide the cheapest alcohol ever). Etihad is a horrible deal with its expensive prices & cheap service onboard and impolite staff - an airline to avoid. I recommend Etihad becomes a low cost carrier with it's extremely bad services both on ground & on air.

### "gone to the bottom of the pile"
Kuala Lumpur to Abu Dhabi. Have had a gold card now for 8 years with Etihad and they used to be excellent but over the last couple of years have gone to the bottom of the pile. But the final nail in the coffin was when, on a half empty plane, I was told i was not allowed to move to a empty row of bulkhead seats, wrote to Etihad and had a blunt reply insinuating that if i want to move there I have to pay a ridiculously high fee. Asked to see cabin supervisor to explain but she didn't have the courtesy or guts to talk to me. I have a couple more flights booked but after that I'm changing airlines

### "never fly with Etihad again"
Islamabad to London via Abu Dhabi. At check in I was refused because the flight was overbooked as told by the check in staff. What surprised me is she ask me to pay around 300USD or wait till the check in close which is an hour before the flight time. More surprising when she said my aircraft was A380 but because we have less passengers we going to send Boeing 777, but I didn't understood why she ask to pay again to guarantee me the seat when I all ready paid for my ticket. Anyway one hour before my flight they issued me a boarding card and I checked in. Will never fly with Etihad again, in flight the food, seat or entertainment nothing is good.

### "put up with the rubbish"
Brisbane to London via Abu Dhabi. Check in staff were OK but there were no proper instructions at the tome of boarding. On board, it seem, the flight crew do not have fine training. There is no menu card and staff did not know what food there were serving. When serving, he asked me if I wanted Chicken or Lamb, so I asked what is the dish and he said in broken English that "it is like Chicken Pasta & Spicy Lamb" So my wife & I ordered one each. What we got was tasted like Thai Green Chicken curry with Rice Noodles & Lamb Biriyani. After a 14 Hour flight, 2 hours before landing in Brisbane at 6pm, they started to serve a snack! When asked what it was, he said "Vegetarian" & I got a Chocolate Danish Pastry with Custard! The tray was left on our tables until 30 mins before we landed - the whole service was a mess. If I had a choice, I would prefer not to travel with Etihad but if the price is very  cheap, I may be forced to put up with the rubbish or take my own food.

### "appeared unpolished and hassled"
Not Verified |  Bangkok to Abu Dhabi. Business, flight was very full - Check In/ Immigration a breeze . New lounge provided by third party is an improvement but food not great, quite basic and ok drinks. Right across from the gate , boarded early and flight on time. This was a 6 hour flight and the crew were average, seemed rushed and not very engaging - did the basics, slow service and lacked previous crews interaction and personal touch. Meal service was ok, a crab starter and a small main course .. wines ok.. though the service started about 2 hours into the flight and took too long a time with courses delayed and empty delph and cutlery left to long to be cleared. Arrived 30 minutes early as mentioned and into a bridge which was a plus. Overall not up to their usual standard and the service appeared unpolished and hassled.

### "Please be a little generous""
I flew Etihad last 16 September from Frankfurt to Manila via Abu Dhabi. From Abu Dhabi to Manila, that is about more than eight hours (8 hrs) flight. After about forty five minutes of flying, a full meal was served which I am assuming to be breakfast. I chose a chicken with noodles meal. To my surprise, the thin rice noodles contain two small pieces of chicken, and it was extra spicy (which was not mentioned by the stewardess). To top it all, the appetizer was a mixture of some vegetables with the same type of noodles with a sour-sweet-spicy vinaigrette! I did not eat the bread as it is too much for me. I ate a small amount of dessert. Then, more than halfway of the journey, I was getting hungry already (we are above Bangkok). I asked the stewardess if they are serving food again and I was told 'Yes!'. So, the food came and it was a choice between sandwich or noodle in a cup! I told the stewardess I want both as I am too hungry! I was told 'only one, and if there will be extra, I will come back and give you. The sandwich is a pan with mostly tomatoes (Mexican-type flavor),I ate all of it as I am very hungry. Later, the stewardess came with the same sandwich, and I politely declined. This is more than an eight hour flight, and for passengers two smaller meals will be healthier than one full meal. If you had a breakfast at 9am, after five hours, you will feel hungry, and want your lunch. I just felt Etihad is not sensitive to these passengers. Please be a little generous and give healthy food.

### "most pathetic customer service"
Johannesburg to New York via Abu Dhabi. The most pathetic example of customer service I have ever experienced. The cabin crew unfriendly at every interaction giving a general sense of disdain for the passengers on board. Generally confrontational reactions to any request, including hour long waits for additional snacks (we only asked once), refusal to provide additional blankets to children and the elderly passengers. Unable to handle detour, exceptionally poor communication and confrontational staff. The flight could not land due to bad weather. Delays totalling 12 hours were experienced between landing in Toronto and departing Toronto the next day. A total wait in Toronto of 32 hours. On landing in Toronto, a 5 hour delay during which no food or beverages were given and people were refused blankets because they were “reserved for the next flight”. On entering the airport all passengers were left to fend for themselves. No communication on where to go, who to see or what the detailed plan was. All we knew was that we would be put up in a hotel for the night. On the flight to New York, waiting for 4 hours for a 1 hour flight supposed to depart at 7pm but departed at 11pm. The highlights during this time being a rude “customer service” employee of Etihad making veiled threats to Muslim passengers who were understandably irate (as was everybody else). A pilot who called the police citing unrest on the plane due to many passengers questioning the air hosts about our departure time. We were then fed constant empty promises of departure in 15 minutes from 9pm to 11pm. The food was terrible. I will never fly Etihad again. The customer service rot at Etihad runs right through the organisation, from the airline staff to the airport customer service staff, the call centre staff and pilots.

### "flying Qatar in my next trip "
Sydney to Athens via Abu Dhabi. After paying close to full price on a couple of business class flights I am left significantly underwhelmed. Today after finishing off a phone call with an Etihad contact centre rep I feel disappointed. Ground staff at Abu Dhabi have been given next to no training in customer service and come across as disinterested at best. Staff barely made eye contact and blunt in their communication and generally obvious that they were unwilling. 2. Contact Centre: downright rude and unhelpful. I didn’t even get to finish a sentence and was ordered to contact my travel agent and then once I somehow managed to correct them (ie that the issue was not travel agent related) was ordered to visit the website to make changes. Website / apps are hopeless. Good luck trying to book a chauffeur service through this portal. Business class seats, now starting to show its age, not as comfortable on long haul as say a Qantas seat even though it looks more flashy. Food is hit and miss, some dishes were ok, some were way overcooked, overall average. In summary I am left considerably underwhelmed. Will be flying Qatar in my next trip who are much better in all the above.

### "A very poor service"
Karachi to Toronto via Abu Dhabi / Brussels. A very poor service by a well-reputed airline. I had heard that it would be a bad experience before my travel, but didn’t expect it. Unfortunately, we got a 2 way ticket and have to return back home via the same airline. However, wouldn’t recommend or travel again with this airline. It was a sad, unexpected experience. Pros: - nothing (all airlines give the basic, infact the service by other airlines even in economy class is commendable) Cons: - a very inconsiderate & mismanaged crew staff (trust me, it matters) - we had opted for a baby bassinet, but after our 2nd layover we had to pay 120euros to get the baby bassinet (no courtesy in their ground staff either) - it would sound funny, but no toy for a baby. It was a first for me. Why choose this airline when there are other better options.

### "This is totally unacceptable"
Abu Dhabi to Melbourne. On boarding for the 13 hour flight which departed at 10am I was offered a glass of juice and my meal order was taken. I was told the meal would arrive in a few hours. Soon after take off the cabin crew darkened the window shades indicating they were encouraging passengers to sleep during the day time flight. I would have thought drinks would be offered and served soon after take off however this was not the case. There was no offer of coffee or any other drink. I also thought lunch would arrive around three hours later as promised. Nothing arrived. I didn't mention anything as I know how busy things can be. 7.5 hours after take off I was offered a coffee. Still no meal. I mentioned I was becoming hungry and have waited for my meal. No response. Cabin crew were largely invisible during the entire flight. 11 hours after departure the flight attendant offered me a coffee or pastry which I declined as I said was still waiting to be served lunch. He walked away. Soon after another flight attendant placed a bottle of water on my table and walked away. That’s the limit of inflight service I experienced. There is absolutely no excuse to have to endure a thirteen hour flight without a meal. Surely the flight attendant knew I was not served any food. He took the order. He knew the order was to be served. He knew it was not served. He knew he had not removed any plates from my table. I fly business class between Australia and Europe every year, usually on Etihad. My experience with Etihad is the service is inconsistent at best and to expect little. In thirteen hours I was served only a glass of fruit juice and a bottle of water. This is totally unacceptable in any class of travel. My complaint to Etihad resulted in an offer of 5000 points in their frequent flyer program. I am not a member. I checked and it would offer me a cheap cap for my trouble. Etihad customer relations seems to regard its customers with as much contempt as some of its flight attendants. I have already booked next year's flights to Paris, but with a different airline. Every year with Etihad there's yet another issue.

### "miss our connection flight"
Cairo to Los Angeles via Abu Dhabi. On 12 September flight number EY658 scheduled for departure from Cairo at 1AM was delayed by 3 hours that made me and many other passengers miss our connection flight to Los Angeles from Abu Dhabi. Etihad Airways in Abu Dhabi airport twisted my arm to take flight going to Washington they said if I didn't take it I'm not getting anything I'm going lose the ticket, so I had to take the flight to Washington and from Washington there was a connection flight going to LAX. Eventually I arrived lax by 10pm instead of arriving 2pm first of all fligh has 1 stop more expensive than flight has 2 stops. I asked them to pay me back the difference as it's my right they refused and they was so rude about it. I lost my  non refundable $485 domestic flight taking me from LAX and I had to stay at the airport for 12 hours to catch first flight going to Austin.

### "plane was half empty"
Los Angeles to Abu Dhabi. This was a comfortable flight as the plane was half empty and we were able to lay down on the whole row. The lunch was very good and tasted fresh. The flight attendants this time were professional and attentive. One flight attendant provided me with a blanket to use as prayer mat and gave me a whole bottle of water when I asked for a glass.

### "ended up being brilliant"
Moscow to Bangkok via Abu Dhabi. I really don't understand all the negative reviews here. I have read them all and was preparing for a horrible experience, but Etihad ended up being brilliant, and I can't wait to fly with them again. Moscow - Abu Dhabi flight. I have selected seats online before they discontinued the free seat selection, and surprisingly all my selected seats stayed intact. Check in was quick and orderly, boarding commenced on-time. Our 3-year old Airbus 321 was very comfortable, with wide seats and decent legroom in economy, as well as an updated and fast IFE system. Cabin crew were very pleasant, smiling, well-groomed and efficient. The meal service was without menus, but you could look up the meals for your flight online on Etihad website - it matched 100%. The metal cutlery made the whole experience classy. Meal service included complimentary wines, beers (Stella Artois and Budweiser), gin, whiskey, rum and vodka, plus non-alcoholic beverages. Cabin crew were generous with the drinks, mixing cocktails and giving out extra beer and other drinks to whoever asked them. I had the hindu meal, and it was very filling and healthy. IFE had few movies in Russian, but I guess that is to be expected, but the movie library in English was great and appealed to my taste. When I asked for a beer in the middle of the flight, the cabin crew member gave me two cans, saying "why have one when you can have two". Transit in Abu Dhabi was very quick and painless, but I wish we had jet-bridges instead of buses to the terminal. Abu Dhabi - Bangkok boarded via jet bridge, on-time once again. The flight was quite full, but I managed to score an empty seat next to me. Boeing 777-300 is a bit less comfortable than Airbus 321 due to seat width, but the seat pitch is still very much okay, and the experience is still good. The cabin crew passed with towelettes and water before takeoff, which was a very nice touch. IFE was a bit less responsive, but the content was the same. Meal service was amazing, I have never had such delicious dishes on the plane in economy. My hindu meal was simply mouthwateringly delicious, and I wouldn't mind getting this food in a cafe on the ground. My mother had Fish Sayadiah, which was just exceptional as well. Drinks were, once again, poured liberally and generously, with crew making a first full round of drinks with a small savoury snack before the meal, the second one with the meal and once more after the meal. Bangkok - Abu Dhabi. Check in was lightning fast, and the ground staff at check in and at the gate were lovely, smiling, cracking jokes and being efficient and the same time. Boarding was on time, very orderly via boarding groups, and done via jet bridge. The plane was a Boeing 777-300 again, and the onboard experience mirrored the one on the previous flight - a lot of drinks, friendly, smiling and polished crew, delicious meals, adequate seating, great IFE. Abu Dhabi - Moscow. This flight was on an older Airbus 320, with sluggish IFE system, but it still was perfectly ok. What was not ok, however, was the fact that armrests on this airplane didn't go fully up - only like 45 degrees. Due to the armrest situation I struggled to get comfortable and lie down. Cabin crew were amazingly friendly, polite and eager to assist for a flight that departed at 3am. The flight was quiet and uneventful. Overall, Etihad exceeded my expectations, and I will gladly fly them again!

### "not courteous and with attitude"
Amman to Abu Dhabi. Outdated plane, filthy seats and bathroom. They changed plane type and that messed up seating arrangements. We boarded plane very early and still the flight was delayed. Staff not courteous and with attitude. Food quality is very low as we are offered a bag with two tasteless semi-sandwiches. Overpriced and below quality, which has been on the decline since September 2017.

### "flight was quite unconventional"
Abu Dhabi to New York. Aside from being long, this flight was quite unconventional. I was sitting in seat number 48 K (the first economy cabin where the stairs are). The flight attendant treated the passengers as if they were an inconvenience. She even went out of her way and roughly “knocked” the toilet door at me and asked me to “hurry up, please” because an old lady was waiting her turn and was apparently in her way. Etihad needs to get crash courses from ANA, Japan Airlines or Qatar Airways on how to treat passengers. Also, who serves spicy chickpeas and lentils on a 14 hour flight!

### "Terrible experience"
Washington to Bangalore via Abu Dhabi. Terrible experience for my elderly mother in law flying on Etihad Airways. She was on wheel chair assistance. Started with more than 3 hours of standing wait time to check in. At transit in Abu Dhabi she was denied boarding, and was provided one meal in a span of 12 hours. She had to stay in the lobby for more than 12 hours. Airlines did not contact the phone numbers associated with the booking to let them know of the situation. Airline offered $200 voucher to travel with them in a span of one year, which is not in line with the US DOT guidelines or EU Regulations or DGCA India guidelines. They are outside of any regulative authority at Abu Dhabi and can get away with a terrible service & poor compensation.

### "Sad and very disappointing"
Not Verified |  Abu Dhabi to Chicago. I don’t know where to begin - food bland, lukewarm, horribly presented. To clear the trays : 20 min wait time , because no crew visible. Halfway into the flight  toilets filthy, paper towels ran out. No yoghurt available, even though advertised. Drink service very slow. Seat uncomfortable and filthy. Touch screen filthy. Entertainment offer not good. Amenity kit a joke. Not a premium product at all, even though premium price charged. Delta, Klm, AF, even UA has the better product for a lot less money. Sad and very disappointing. I had better service on some so called budget carriers in Economy Class. Even for extra water one has to beg. WiFi ultra slow and super expensive - total rip-off

### "uncomfortable journey"
Chicago to Abu Dhabi. Over 12 hours of uncomfortable journey. Worst Leg space and seat width. Food was terrible, they served mushrooms in vegeterian meal ( Although its debatable, but i dont prefer earing mushrooms). Vegetarian meal was tasteless. Mediocre crew and in flight services. The inflight entertainment was not good either with very less range of selections and most of the equipment was outdated and the touch screen did not respond at all. Even the remote interaction was sluggish therby leading The entire flight experience from bad to worse. I had a connection from American airlines to Chicago and American Airlines voluntarily offered to check in our carryin luggage for free. However upon reaching the Etihad gate, the crew asked us whether we paid money for checking in 6 bags and was questioning us. The better way would be to ask customer if American Airlines checked in your carryon luggage at gate (yes/ no). The ground staff-crew seemed very unprofessional and rude.

### "miss my connecting flight"
London to Phuket via Abu Dhabi. I was looking forward to my first experience with Etihad. I checked the check in time and was second in the queue. Checking in did not start until 30mins after the advertised time as the staff that were there, were engaged in admin, putting on roles of paper and checking the computers. When I went forward the printer did not work, the representative had problems with the computer and after a further half hour I asked to be referred to either another agent or a supervisor. She came along and said to her colleague and what’s the matter now, I think this was not the first time a problem like this had occurred. The whole episode did not give me confidence that my luggage would reach its final destination. No security questions were asked or covered which was perhaps the most serious omission. When I did get onto the aircraft it was delayed a further hour which would mean I would miss my connecting flight. No explanation or apology was given or any arrangements for connecting flight. No organisation is perfect and things do go wrong with the best of carriers, but they are remembered for what they do to put things right and this did not happen before, during or after the flight to date. This is submitted as a constructive review in the hope that training can be given within customer service to both meet and exceed customers expectations.

### "They have cut it to the bone"
Not Verified |  Paid over $12.000 for a return to trip from Australia to UK. From arriving at the desk in Manchester for our return journey to Brisbane we were treated badly. We knew our allowance of 40kilo but didn’t go on the website to view the conditions, you are only allowed 32 kilo in each case and ours weighed in at 33 kilo. We were told either to go and buy a suitcase or unpack the case, where were we supposed to buy a suitcase at 4.30 in the morning. We had to empty our cases at the checking in desk and then had to go to the back of the queue and wait another 45 mins. About 20 business class seats in the cabin and when it came to order food the response was sorry we have run out of that. Ok it says on the menu,”if available “ good get out clause for them. Second leg same thing happened again and my wife had to order a sandwich with a piece of cake,  8 hours later the food still hadn’t arrived. After a wait for food my wife decided to lay down and go to sleep.hence the not telling them till she woke up. Then they were told “ you never brought any food” response “sorry we forgot”. All apologies but didn’t make up for the fact that the service as abysmal. They took my name, tel number and email address and said they would be in touch, they got in touch and the reply was “sorry we’ll try to do better next time”. They have cut it to the bone. You use to get a limousine service to and from the airports - not now. You use to get a toilet bag with bottles of perfume and deodorant, not now. I am afraid if you want to throw away your hard earned cash, travel Etihad.

### "an awful experience"
Dublin to Delhi via Abu Dhabi. Well it was an awful experience. As per the experience flying on Etihad Airways I am not going to fly ever again in this airline. Ground staff was not good, they were not helpful at all. My baggage was lost and then the ground staff call me to intimate that they find out my baggage & when ever it will arrive they are going to delivered to my mention address which they have not done it. So many problems I faced in this trip.

### "huge electronic issues"
Sydney to Abu Dhabi. Business Studios from Etihad are known for having huge electronic issues and are often in malfunction. Experienced already three times and confirmed by crew members. They tell you to contact the airline for a refund and guess what happens. Last flight they had trouble with 6 in my flight.

### "service was not good"
Auckland to Madinah via Abu Dhabi. Always fly with Emirates but this time we toke Etihad Airways from Auckland to Saudia Arabia and return back to Auckland. Always first impression is last immersion. Very poor service crew are very rude except from Abu Dhabi to Melbourne. Food quality was not what I expected. Please don't compare with Emirates they are 5 stars. If you are looking budget airline then go for Etihad they are good for that. Will not fly again with them. We bought ticket from Etihad but from Auckland to Melbourne and return back to Auckland from Melbourne they use codeshare with Virgin Australia. No food on this flight - even their office apologized with us when we complained but also no food on return. Hopeless service. Please be careful when you booking with them and make sure which airline they use for their codeshare if they not flying on that sector. Their seats are very small and their 777 aircraft are very old. Sorry Etihad but your service was not good.

### "will never fly with them again"
Gold Coast to Manchester via Abu Dhabi. So after having no luggage for the first 2 days of my holiday (as left in Melbourne I was in Manchester) and no medication, I have been trying now for nearly 2 weeks to get a response regarding a possible upgrade or something. Somebody called answered my complaint on Facebook pretty quick but since then nothing! They kept promising a response by yesterday as this is when I’ve started my journey back to oz, but nothing. Multiple emails with just automated responses, no phone numbers to actually talk to a person. When I chose to fly with Etihad there were many many bad reviews but I wanted to be the one that gave a good one. I can’t do that now I will never fly with them again. Upon boarding in Manchester I spoke to a lovely woman who gave me an extra seat to myself and the promised I’d have the same from Abu Dhabi to Melbourne. And surprise surprise that’s not happened either. So so disappointed with how this has been, well, not been handled. Basically don’t fly with Etihad, they will lose your luggage and then do nothing about it.

### "a 3 star airline at best"
Bangkok to London via Abu Dhabi. Uncomfortable seat pads, rude/moody staff and entertainment system isn't active until about 30 mins after take off and was switched off 45 minutes before landing. I asked cabin crew why, just said its policy and walked off - this airline has no interest in customers. Entertainment system is good otherwise, but this crazy policy compared with competitors who leave it on while on the ground is bizarre. As others have said they have recently introduced charges for seat reservations which have been applied irrespective of when the booking was made - if it's free on booking, it should be remain free! And the policy for exit rows is ludicrous - something like £140 per seat per segment, so as most people connect through AUH that would be £560 each for a return trip!! For our family of 4 that would he £2,200. This is a 3 star airline at best, will not be using ever again.

### "Very bad experience"
Hong Kong to Amman via Abu Dhabi. Very bad experience, I had to stay in Abu Dhabi for about 12 overnight, ground staff didn't afford me a hotel for rest for the reason I purchased the ticket from China, and it is not in my route. I think the ticket was issued from Etihad system, and they know the connection time. The staff is acting like they are giving you from their own money. I asked in two counters, the first one gave the answer that my ticket does not include this service and I have to pay, and maybe my nationality will not allow me to get a hotel. Then the other counter informed me with reason I shared above.

### "Going back to Emirates"
Los Angeles from Abu Dhabi, I got bumped off my flight because there were no more seats available. I wasn’t able to checkin online because there’s a problem in their online check-in. They gave me a voucher worth USD300 which you cannot use anywhere, worthless. On the way back from LAX to AUH, their online check-in is not working again. Apparently, there are missing details which there was no information written what’s missing. I had to find out by myself. Finally I was able to check-in. In the plane, my seat recliner is not working. But the staff were nice. When I landed in AUH, one baggage claim area belt had 5 flights on it so it was a mess. And the taxi queue system was unbelievable because the exit areas are so small, everyone had only one exit to go. So even if there are a lot of taxis at the airport, the queue system is so slow and inefficient, it took me an hour to be at the front of the line to get a cab. I will never fly Etihad again. They were good 8 years back, then I switched to Emirates. Thought I would give them a try again. I shouldn’t have. Going back to Emirates!

### "Very bad experience"
Not Verified |  Amman to Abu Dhabi. Very bad experience. Etihad used to be a good airline but not any more. We used to have meals as it is 3 hours flight. Now they changed the meals to sandwiches with very bad taste. I don't think it was made for humans. The staff is really rude. The AC was not working well and the temperature in the plane was really hot. In summary, we are paying a lot and not getting the true value of money.

### "staff on plane were amazing"
London to Abu Dhabi. Airport staff in London and on plane were amazing. The bus service on the other hand was disgusting. Driver refused to let me get on the bus even though it was not full to capacity. He then told me to sit and wait after half an hour of sitting in the sun with all the bus drivers standing around with empty buses staring at me giggling. He told me you can’t get on the bus till 10. This was at 8 in the morning. The staff inside Abu Dhabi airport weren’t any better when I approached the man to complain he Just slouched in his chair like a fat king with no care.

### "horrible, cynical, unfair policy"
Abu Dhabi to London. Etihad have recently cancelled the ability to book / change Economy Class seats free of charge before the flight. What is worse is that when you try to book a seat using their useless "Guest" program it simply loads a splash screen saying "unable to manage booking" so you are left wondering if there is a glitch with your ticket. My ticket was issued early July and I changed the seat on my outward leg no issue. Turns out that this new policy was introduced from July 10 so because my return leg is late August I have to pay to change my seat. That seems doubly unfair as the ticket was purchased with the understanding that seat changes were a free option. To rub even more salt in to the wound apparently you can check in 48 hours before online but you can only choose a seat for free 24 hours before. So you are left with a Mexican stand-off between checking in and being auto allocated a seat or checking in "late" after selecting a free seat from a depleted choice! Cynical or what? And it gets worse. Both in my "Guest" account and using their web site I can't even access to pay for a seat choice! I fly Etihad on business monthly and this horrible, cynical, unfair policy is a deal-breaker for me. +1 lost customer Etihad!

### "hospitality and care"
My septuagenarian parents who are physically challenged and were travelling alone wish to express their extreme satisfaction with the hospitality and care by the Etihad staff during their flight back to India. There was a severe crisis with floods hitting Kerala and the Kochi International airport being shut down. There was a long layover at Abu Dhabi airport as flights were being rescheduled to accommodate for cancelled flights. The staff were considerate enough to reschedule the tickets and provide the preferred airport considering my parents age. The service at the airport hotel where they were placed during the layover was exceptional.

### "at best a 3-star airline"
Dublin to Bangkok via Abu Dhabi. Etihad needs to get a grip and not totally rip off their passengers. I wished to change just 1 leg of our 4 leg ticket to have a stay over in Abu Dhabi. I checked the current rate for the new date and it was practically identical to what we had paid. The current business return for the journey - all 4 legs - today is €2,250. Etihad wants the absurd sum of €2,300 to change just the 1 leg by 2 days .- remember, for which I had already paid. A mere single simple change of 1 leg fby 2 days so we could stay 2 nights on Abu Dhabi for which we had already paid. Quite disgraceful. Getting onto their basic and clearly understaffed agents is a waste of time. I was left for 22 minutes before the agent cut me off. Today it was 18 minutes before I got any answers. What on earth do these agents to for the 6 minutes she went away for, after 12 minutes already, just to check the next day flight? A 5-star airline? Perhaps when they started but not anymore. Etihad is at best a 3-star airline. By the way, on the flight, they ran out of all our choices for dinner so we did not eat.Good planning Etihad. Well done. My headphones did not work.

### "carry on luggage was too big"
Toronto to Beirut via Abu Dhabi. At check-in, i was obliged to get rid of my carry on luggage, that I always travel with, as they insisted that it was too big. Once on board I saw that other passengers have bigger and larger carry on, and that was not fair.

### "will avoid Etihad in future."
Pune to Dusseldorf via Abu Dhabi. Etihad shares incorrect pickup numbers (Rail&Fly) and lets the customer sit at the additional cost. In October 2017 my wife and I flew with Etihad from TXL via AMS and AUH to PNQ. Originally the flight was to go directly from TXL via AUH to PNQ. However, there was a rebooking due to the Air Berlin bankruptcy, so that our flight went longer than planned. Even worse was the rebooking of the return flight, which did not go to Berlin as planned but to Düsseldorf from where we were to continue with the DB. For this we were given pick-up numbers, with which one would receive the train tickets directly at the automat. The outbound flight went as planned. On our return flight we arrived in DUS with a slight delay and hurried to the station. At the Automat it turned out, however, that the pick-up numbers were wrong. A DB employee checked on the computer and confirmed that there were no orders for the numbers provided. Since we had already reserved seats for the train, we decided to buy train tickets at our own expense to finally get home after the long flight. The train tickets were accordingly expensive (205 Euro for two persons) Only a few days later I contacted Etihad. Some e-mails and phone calls followed, until I was told to fill out a form with the bank details for reimbursement and the train tickets should be enclosed. I sent the documents by registered letter to Etihad in Berlin. Of course this was accepted (registered mail). However, there was never a reaction. Since I didn't buy my tickets directly from Etihad but from Flighttix.com, which I contacted first and which told me I had to contact Etihad because Etihad gave me the wrong pickup numbers, I contacted Flighttix.com again in April 2018. The contact persons were very friendly and promised me to clarify the matter with Etihad. E-mail correspondence followed between Flighttix, Etihad and myself, after which Etihad finally requested my bank details again for reimbursement. After I transmitted it, I thought it was finally done and I could sleep peacefully again. Unfortunately, there was never any refund. With my inquiries to Flighttix I got several times feedback that they will inquire with Etihad. My direct requests to the employee of Etihad (Commercial Planning Agent), with whom the correspondence took place, all went to nothing. E-mails were never answered and on the phone came only the automatic announcement that the contact person was currently not available. It's really sad how Etihad has behaved here. You are prepared to accept a much longer flight, even if you changed your reservation to a train journey, and in the end you would be left with additional costs and would be ignored by the airline after investing so much time and effort in clarifying the facts. The flight itself was fine. However, I will avoid Etihad in the future. My hope of receiving reimbursement and an apology after almost a year is fading.

### "Abu Dhabi to Delhi"
Abu Dhabi to Delhi. Very disappointed, ground staff totally unorganized, there was no specific check in counter for each destination, we reached 3 hours before and were standing in line but the others who came late of different flights were been called forward when we asked the reason they said their flight is before us so that we have to call them first even when they came late. Due to which after 2:30 hour standing in line when we reach on check in counter they said flight is over booked and we have to re book it again. Then we again went to another counter for re-booking the ticket, the guy on rebooking counter was so slow took 1 hour to book 3 tickets and was not even bothered about the line. When we at last reach on the rebooking counter they gave us a flight of 10pm which were reaching New Delhi at 3:30 AM. Since our flight was canceled we we’re eligible for 200$ discount on nxt flight, lunch&dinner voucher and stay in hotel until we get our next flight as per etihad policy, person on rebooking counter gave us 200$ voucher only and when I asked, is there anything else we should get? he clearly said no. Then we went to his supervisor to complain about this, he send us again to him for other things - he gave us breakfast vouncher which was of no use and when i asked 3rd time he only gave me lunch and dinner voucher but still no hotel stay. The staff behavior was very disappointing and unprofessional.

### "worst air travel experience"
Lahore to Washington via Abu Dhabi booked using Hotwise about 2 weeks prior to departure. We got the conformation email with the E ticket and PNR numbers. I verified the booking at Etihad website and everything looked fine. I was traveling with my child. At Lahore airport check in, I was only provided boarding passes from Lahore to Abu Dhabi and was advised that I would get the boarding passes for Washington in Abu Dhabi. When we arrived at Abu Dhabi, it turned out that next flight was overbooked and there were no seats. I was advised that all the flights to Washington were overbooked for next few days. The only option they gave me was to fly to Brussels the next day and then from there to Washington. We had no choice. It was very hard with the child traveling with me. Our travel duration suddenly went from 21 hours to 40 hours and we finally got to our destination a full day later. It was bad that they overbooked the flight but to make matters worse they failed to disclose it at the Lahore airport. If I was given a choice there, I would have opted not to board the first flight and gone over the alternatives with them there. I had the option of going home if things did not work out. But they never gave me that option and conned me in to boarding that first flight. They made our travel horrible and made us suffer. There were lines of people on transit desk arguing with them about the same issue. Is that how they would treat their own families. This was one of the worst air travel experience we had. Never Etihad. You lost at least our family.

### "extremely rude"
While travelling from Wellington to Islamabad via Brisbane and Abu Dhabi. An 8 hours stay in Abu Dhabi no meal provided. The staff at help desk at Etihad Airways is extremely rude and not helpful. I rang help desk in Brisbane at least they have some customer service skill - they said sorry, but here in Abu Dhabi OMG!

### "I have been let down"
Johannesburg to New York via Abu Dhabi. After reading multiple mixed reviews, I thought I’d give Etihad the benefit of the doubt. I booked my ticket with them and paid a lot of money. I must say that I have been let down. I have been fortunate to fly many airlines and Etihad has been the least helpful to date. On my leg from Abu Dhabi to JFK, I was put in a seat that that had no cabin space above me for my hand luggage. As a result the air hostesses took my hang luggage and places it (split up) in various cabins down my aisle. When it came to disembarking at JFK, I forgot one of these items as they weren’t all in one spot. After realising that I forgot my item two hours later, I quickly returned to arrivals to try and find someone who could help me retrieve it - assuming etihad would have an office, station or even just a lost and found. I could not find a single Etihad representative and was told by many airport staff that they wouldn’t be around for quite some time. I had to catch my next connection thereafter. Following online instructions, I phoned the New York Etihad number. I phoned multiple times and had no answer. I’ve left messages. I’ve had no response. I emailed Etihad but the response here was that I should phone the New York etihad number. I’ve even phoned baggage services at JFK who have told me to contact Etihad. I am out of options despite the great efforts. I understand it’s my fault to have left an item onboard, however, one would think that they would help solve this issue and that a “competitive” airline like Etihad would assist in trying to return personal belongings to their owners. I have read reviews that other airlines certainly have. I’m really upset to have lost my belonging but even more upset to know that it is sitting with Etihad who do not care at all about their customers. Utterly disappointed and something like this will definitely deter me from using Etihad again.

### "rapidly declining service standards"
Abu Dhabi to Singapore. I don’t expect any response from Etihad because they acted within their rules but it is important that people understand how these rules affect their Platinum members. I was recently traveling business class from Abu Dhabi with my wife for our 20th wedding anniversary. I also paid for my daughter, son in law and my two grandchildren to travel with us for a family holiday to celebrate. As Platinum members (through all our business travel) my wife and I are entitled to bring a guest each into the First Class Lounge. My youngest grandchild was able to enter for free. However the Etihad staff insisted on charging me 100 USD to admit my 7 year old grandson to the Lounge. I refused to pay such an extortionate amount for a 7 year old and we had to leave. My poor grandson then got incredibly upset as he felt he had let us all down. He was inconsolable. Nice work Etihad, because whilst your staff will not know my grandchild is autistic, their actions have consequences. Still at least you enforced your rules. Even better, didn’t get the 100 USD and as a bonus upset 2 loyal Platinum members on their 20th wedding anniversary whose loyalty to this airline with rapidly declining service standards is now severely strained. Can’t argue with that policy can you! Now where did I put Emirates phone number.

### "an unpleasant experience"
Etihad Seat Allocation Policy is a major drawback. Seats can only be reserved by paying additional fees. At over $40 per sector (for non premium seats) this adds about 15% to the cost of the flight. Travel agent told me seat allocation is free at check-in. Online check-in opens 48 hours before, but again you can only select seats by paying, you only get free seat allocation if you checking within 24 hours of your flight. This is the only airline I have flown (apart from outright budget airlines) that have this policy. Be careful in comparing based on ticket price alone. Haven't even travelled yet and I have an unpleasant experience.

### "poor quality service"
Not Verified |  Amman to Washington DC via Abu Dhabi. My first and last flight with Etihad Airways. Very long trip almost 14 hours (from Abu Dhabi to Washington DC)with poor quality service and catastrophic quality of food. The seat is not comfortable. I will not at all recommend this company.

### "Sadly disappointing"
Melbourne to Dublin via Abu Dhabi. Sadly disappointing and a very underwhelming business class experience with Etihad. I remember the days when Etihad was at the top of its game. This is no longer the case. The aircraft interiors are ageing and they are no longer able to compete with the likes of Qatar or Emirates. I flew from Melbourne to Dublin via Abu Dhabi. The aircraft was old and dated. Seats much smaller than their competitors. Food was average - wine selection average. Their IFE system woefully average with only a handful of new releases available. Bathrooms are much smaller than their competitors. No pyjamas offered. The lounge experience in Abu Dhabi was average. Overcrowded and people lining up to use the one available shower. Our flight to Dublin was below average. The business class seats were much smaller than on our long haul flight from Melbourne. Staff were pleasant. I asked for an amenities kit only to be told Etihad no longer provided them on short flights - ask most people and I think they’d agree, 7 and a half hours isn’t really a ‘short flight’. Etihad now strikes me as a ‘budget’ carrier. Gone are the days of it providing a luxurious business class experience.

### "just an average flight"
Not Verified |  Melbourne to Abu Dhabi on business class on an old Boeing 777 that has seen better days. Plane basically left on time & arrived ahead of schedule at Abu Dhabi which was nice. On board crew were very polite catered to your needs. Toilets were kept clean which was a blessing. Food was just average though & nothing to write home about. IFE is woefully behind the likes of Qatar in terms of movie releases & variety of choice. Tried the onboard WiFi but really it’s very slow & eats up your allotment very quickly so be warned if you decide to give it a go..it’s a bit of a con to get extra money from your pocket. Really on good for texting or iMessaging. As for the business class seat it’s average but it’s a lot better on their Boeing 787. On this 777 it’s very cramped & claustrophobic. This flight was just an average flight getting from A to B on time with no nasty issues.

### "check-in baggage left behind"
London to Kuala Lumpur via Abu Dhabi. The worst flight experience I have had in all 24 years of my life (inclusive of budget airlines). Mainly due to - upon arrival in Malaysia from London just 2 days before my relative's wedding, of which I was an organiser - my check-in baggage being left behind in Abu Dhabi, which had my wedding ceremony clothing and materials. Thanks to the worst possible timing for a baggage delay, I have had to sink my savings to get backup, subpar clothes for what was otherwise a perfectly planned wedding! This is not the first time I've heard of Etihad's baggage handling issues, and I regret not listening closer to friends' advice. To add salt to injury, stewardesses on the flight were rude, one of which said during meal service, "we only have the vegetarian pasta option, is that okay? , with her hand already half outstretched with the tray close to my table. She could have some common courtesy and ask for my preference first! I have had better and more courteous service on Easyjet and Ryanair. Unfortunately I have a return flight leg from Kuala Lumpur back to London and I am nervous thinking about what problems are going to surface on that leg of the journey. If I could afford it, I would rather purchase another airline's tickets and take a longer transit than fly this airline again.

### "seat was not assigned"
I logged online to upgrade 3 of our 10 travelers to extra leg room seats. My parents and my partner and infant. When one of the seats was not assigned, even though I had paid for it, I called the help centre to find out why. When I spoke to the agent he told me I had not selected extra leg room seats, rather standard seats. These travelers already had standard seats allocated beside the rest of my family, before I went online to upgrade, so I ultimately chose seats away from the rest of our family for nothing, because I thought they were extra leg room seats. When I asked could I still get the extra leg room and pay the difference they advised me I will have to pay full price, the money I already paid 321 odd euro will be lost in the process. I am shocked and feel like I have been robbed. An honest mistake, which they found out about with 10 minutes of my doing So, meant nothing to them. Also, the seat I assigned for my partner and my child in the same transaction did not get allocated but I got charged for it. So they are also in the wrong. I am just been fobbed off every agent I speak to. Policy policy policy is all I am hearing. They do not seem to take general misunderstandings into account. There should at least be some sort of grace where time is concerned. They were aware I had made the error within 15 minutes. Why is there no proper customer service within this company. Nobody cares that I am in more debt with nothing now to show for it. My parents will have to suffer on their first ever flight, 24 hours long, with no space. This airline has absolutely no consideration for their customers if this is how they treat us when a mistake is made. They keep saying it was my mistake but they never allocated a seat for my partner so they too made a mistake, where is their liability? I am in dismay by the lack of understanding in a genuine case. I already had seats before I went online. Surely they could see this was an honest error made. We paid over 10,000 for our group trip, now an added 321 for nothing. Worse seats than what I had initially.

### "Will never use again"
Riyadh to Tokyo via Abu Dhabi. Airline staff forced me to check a bag that was carry on size, resulting in a $320 baggage fee. Bag’s handle was destroyed in route, so I contacted their customer service. Representative was unhelpful and I wasn’t given so much as sky miles for my damaged bag. Will never use again.

### "the worst customer service"
Athens to Brisbane via Abu Dhabi. Etihad has the worst customer service I have ever received. They overbooked our flight from Abu Dhabi to Brisbane, and the man who was telling us this was smirking the entire time. They were all very rude and not one person apologised for the overbooked flight. This route is a once a day flight so we had to wait over 2 hours for our bag to get back to us before they put us up in a 3 star hotel. I would never fly Etihad again based on this experience. No apology and no refund and the flight tickets were not cheap either. Avoid!

### "disgusting food, poor service"
Abu Dhabi to Bangkok. This is a general review, I use Etihad quite often because it operates from my home city and the airmiles accrued through my credit card give me Gold Class membership which allows Business Class service prior to boarding the flight. About 8-10 years ago Etihad was my favourite airline edging out Emirates, Singapore and Qatar. It has steadily deteriorated since that point and for the last few years has felt like a budget airline. It feels like everything is run for the benefit of the airline and the customer is just a cash cow. It is the only airline I now that regularly boards the passengers one hour and 15 minutes before scheduled departure and is almost always late to depart. My last few flights menat that we were boarded almost two hours before take off and that makes a long haul flight that much more uncomfortable. During the two hour wait there are no refreshments and no entertainment. Two bum numbing hours without even a view out of the window as distraction. The refreshements seem to be fewer and further between, even the in seat call button frequently fails to get a response. During my last flight, the meal options were beef, chicken or vegetarian when I asked what the dishes were I was told again 'beef or chicken' I eventually established it was beef and rice or chicken and rice (I didn't ask about the vegetarian option). Airline food is universally mocked for being generally unpalatable but I remember that several years ago Etihad in-flight food as being something that I actually looked forward to. The food on my last flight (Bangkok - Abu Dhabi) was amongst the very worst I have ever had and I left all but small sample bites from the dishes. I also noticed on my last trip that Etihad are now offering an option to buy extra food items. A five star premium airline that sells snacks!! I'm sure that the decline in quality of the food and the introduction of paid for snacks is no coincidence. The entertainment system is still very good but it is switched off unceremoniously about 30 minutes before landing. Some airlines have the entertainment available from the moment you sit down until the time to leave and when I enquired why this isnt possible with Etihad I was told it was for safety reasons. Maybe Etihad have different safety regulations to other Middle East carriers but I suspect that it is so they can collect in the headsets early - which summarises the apparent Etihad policy of prioritising airline convenience over customer comfort. At every stage it seems that costs have been cut and cut and cut and has turned what once was a premium airline which was a pleasure to fly with, into a hollowed out shell with stressed staff, disgusting food, poor service, scant regard for customer comfort and an unwavering eye on the bottom line. In short a budget airline in all but name and price. Think twice before using this airline.

### "departure and arrival was spot on"
Short flight from Bahrain to Abu Dhabi and the plus side was the departure and arrival was spot on so no worries on connecting flights having issues. Service inflight was quite efficient with a clean Cabin. Let’s hope scheduled timing is kept up.

### "never fly Etihad again"
Abu Dhabi to London. Worst airline ever. Aircraft was way too cold. No way for any passenger to control air con. In flight entertainment was lacking, Emirates and Saudi Airlines far better! The cabin crew who were over stretched for the amount of passengers. Would never fly Etihad again. In flight meal was lacking badly. It’s a shame it won’t let me leave a 0 out of 10!

### "baggage policy is ridiculous"
London to Bangkok via Abu Dhabi. First and last time I will ever fly with Etihad. Their baggage policy is ridiculous even if you are just a little bit over the allowance they will charge you extra. It's as if they get commission on these extra charges. They weigh and add every bit of luggage you have even carrier bags that might contain a jacket! Lots of passengers packing and re-packing to meet the weight guidelines. The food selection is bad. Good entertainment system altho it suddenly stops 30 minutes before landing. All other airlines entertainment you can play right until taxiing. Avoid Etihad.

### "considered a low cost airline"
Not Verified |  I traveled Perth to Rome via Abu Dhabi at the beginning of July alone with a one year old baby. I travel to Italy once a year and i usually go with Emirates or Qatar. This time I chose Etihad mainly because of the inflight nanny service. This service wasn't available on my flight and only found out on the day I flew out. The planes were both very uncomfortable, and no comfort kit or baby toys were offered (as Emirates and Qatar  do). Although I requested baby food, nothing was provided. During the flight no one of the staff came and asked if I, a mum traveling solo with a young child, needed help. (Last year Qatar flight attendants came several times making sure all was good and gave me baby food, toys and a pouch with baby lotions and nappies). The food for adults was barely edible and there was no meal choice. I think Etihad has to be considered a low cost airline not a 5-star and should definitely cost less, much less as it is so bad. Not worth the money! It cost more than Emirates and Qatar but it's worth zero compared to them. I will never choose Etihad again or recommend it.

### "Very bad experience"
Abu Dhabi to London. Very bad experience with Etihad. Not enough cabin crew for flight, air conditioning is not through individual vents like other A380s, cabin crew are very rude. IFE system is not up to date & not a lot of choice, no food menu offered (when compared to other Arab carriers menu offered). 4 toilets were not working on this flight. I have no intentions of flying Etihad again. Overall very poor.

### "severely overbook all flights"
Belgrade to Brisbane via Abu Dhabi. In short, Awful. 100% Do not book Etihad if you are traveling too or from Australia. So the flight from Belgrade to Abu Dhabi. Underwhelming. In flight food lacking (a meal 30mins into the 7 hour flight and no more). Upon arrival at Abu Dhabi I was told I wouldn't be on my booked flight because it was badly overbooked and I had no choice. I was also told next time to get to the airport earlier. And no, I was on another Etihad flight was not a good enough excuse. I was simply told it's policy for Etihad to severely overbook all flights involving Australia (apparently there is not legal rules in Australia against this unlike in the EU and USA). And my absolute favourite, It is not Etihad policy to take complaints unless it's an email. I begged them to talk to someone now, I told them I had work and would miss important meetings and lose money I needed to live. They told me it doesn't matter to them. After lengthy complaining I was told they could give me a gift voucher and a window seat. Pathetic. My 1 hour stop over has become 25. Not sure how I'll explain delays to work.

### "all flights delayed"
Heathrow to Kochi via Abu Dhabi. Worst flight ever: I was travelling with my wife and 2 kids. The flight was delayed by an hour from London and the same when landed in Abu Dhabi. There was no buggy available to take the passengers to the next transit area. We were literally running along with other passengers as we only had 45 minutes for all the procedures. When we had finished the transit procedures we were taken to the next flight in a bus packed with people. The worst bit was the next flight was again delayed by an hour after all that hassle. On our return the case was no different with all the flights being delayed. Even on the flight we had to wait 45 minutes for the trays to be cleared after meals were served. They didn't even bother to answer the call bell. Never again!

### "leaves a lot to be desired"
Singapore to Athens via Abu Dhabi. The quality of this airline leaves a lot to be desired. Customer service is virtually non-existent. Even as a Gold member flying Business Class who had spent $25,000 on seats, I was treated by Etihad staff, with utter contempt and disdain. I flew with 6 family members, 2 of whom were infants. We spent more than $25,000 and 400,000 miles on our seats We were all in Business Class. I have been a gold member of the Etihad Guest rewards programme for 3 years. Despite repeated calls to the customer service line before we boarded, they did not manage to sit us together. Furthermore, the cabin crew did not help us to sit near each other, refusing to ask other passengers to move, even though those passengers were flying alone. The plane on the Singapore to Abu Dhabi leg has been replaced. Rather than the B787 which Etihad is quick to pretend flies on this route, it has been replaced by the aged A330, in which the business class offering is old and outdated. The plane is loud and most of all, extremely hot. When I complained about the offering, I was told that "Etihad has the right to choose which planes it flies on its routes". That is of course fine, but when you go to book the ticket online, the website clearly states you are paying for a seat on the Boeing 787. The bassinet seat I was offered for my daughter was above my head. She was able to wriggle out of it, and nearly fell out. The customer services complaints officer has totally ignored my complaints and instead has either insinuated it is my fault or has said that I should have complained on the flight to the crew.

### "do not recommend flying with them"
Washington to Bangkok via Abu Dhabi. I decided to go with them because they were cheaper. After my first flight with them, I should've paid more for world class service from Emirates or Qatar. The staff at the check in were unfriendly, the seat recline broke which forced me to push my seat with my back the whole 12 hour flight. This gave me back pain days after. I couldn't find a flight attendant to notify about the seat. Its not just their staff that arent attentive, its their whole policy towards their less opulent customers. It is really difficult to get in contact with their customer service. To "compensate customers" for a bad flight they give something called travel credits which are worthless to you unless you want to buy another flight or buy overpriced seat selections. I do not recommend flying with them until they see the importance of all their customers and improve their product and policy.

### "nothing but cost cutting"
Paris to Sydney via Abu Dhabi. Such a Disappointment. I have flown Etihad business in the past and what a fall from grace. As a frequent flyer who flies internationally at least 6 times a year and often in business, flying with Etihad is mediocre at best. 4 years ago it was fantastic and couldn't be faulted but now it is very average and nothing special. I travelled on points this time. The points for this Etihad flight are 30 - 60K more than their competitors which is a lot for their entry level business class points tickets. The crew on the CGD to ABU were average and did nothing to make you feel special. The plane was older and nothing special. The food was seriously no better than economy and in fact I have had better food in economy on other airlines in the past. The main meal I had I couldn't eat due to the meat being so full of gristle. There was so little food as well. On the flight from ABU to Sydney I asked what time breakfast was so I could set an alarm to wake up. I was told that Etihad no longer serve breakfast. The reason, 'people are on different time zones'. I said to the hostess that this is ridiculous and it was nothing but cost cutting. I also asked has management changed because something is clearly happening with this airline. I was told it is under new management and the staff are bearing the brunt of disgruntled customers. Maybe this explains why you don't see them much anymore. I must say the hostess I spoke with was really trying and stated I could I lodge a formal complaint with her. I felt that this would possibly be more effective and seeing by the amount of complaints on this site, maybe I was wrong. With regard to breakfast, you can order from the all day menu which includes pastries (2 small), cereal, egg white omelette, noodles or a steak sandwich. You cannot get a real egg omelette and breakfast is lack lustre. The main meal (beef) was so bad again it couldn't be eaten. It was as tough as a brick. I was informed this is because everything is reheated. Food is very poor. Apart from the food, the staff are not often seen like in the past. A few years ago, travelling Etihad business was a treat. Staff were attentitive & polite, food was wonderful and business was worth the money and/or points. Now it's get on, get off. Having flown Premium with another airline late last year, I can honestly state that their Premium was far more superior than Etihad's business class. C

### "was very disappointing"
Edinburgh to Brisbane via Abu Dhabi. Our flight both ways was very disappointing. The service was poor at best, staff quite rude, food scarce and of average quality and whatever you do, don’t dare ask for a second glass of wine on what is almost a 14 hour flight! Whilst we don’t expect much flying economy, basic service, respect and food would be an expectation. It’s back to other carriers for us.

### "had friendlier crews on easyJet flights"
Etihad is the epitome of 'okay'. The first leg of our flight was on a tired looking A330, the cabin of which was looking decidedly dated and the IFE hardware not particularly responsive. The flight attendants were not overly friendly or helpful which was fine but they did not give the impression of working for a premium, full-service airline and I've probably had friendlier crews on easyJet flights. The best that can be said for the meal on this flight was once again, okay, nothing to complain about but nothing exciting either. Although, the use of steel cutlery is nice to see. The primary benefit of transferring at Abu Dhabi is its small size meaning that its relatively easy to get from one gate to another for connections but it was also easy to tell how cramped and crowded it would be to spend more than an hour here for a stopover as the airport certainly needs to expand to meet demand. AUH's most interesting feature is its security policy whereby hand luggage is scanned and passengers made to go through metal detectors which every, single, person seemed to be setting off, including myself, despite having nothing on me and not having had any issues at EDI. This then means being patted down in a small curtained area with an unfriendly and unspeaking member of security staff. Not only this, but once passengers arrive at their gate everyone on our outbound flight (though only certain people on our return, we were waved through without searching strangely) was having their carry-on hand searched which seemed slightly excessive giving all the security measures passengers have already been through up to that point. The next leg of the trip was on a relatively new A380 which had a modern cabin and great IFE system despite the seats being uncomfortable this felt like a much better flight. The crew were marginally more friendly than the EDI-AUH leg but still did not go out of their way to be courteous or helpful for passengers. The most disappointing thing on this flight was the food, not its quality but lack of quantity. There are no menus in economy which is fine but would have been a nice touch. We were served a dinner after takeoff of which there were only two options left so I chose the pasta which was delicious and came with a salad, roll and small pudding. But during this 13 hour flight we were only given one more 'snack' of popcorn and then a breakfast of cinnamon roll and custard before landing in Sydney, at half past five in the evening. This was not enough food for the length of flight. Our return flights were of similar quality the only issue being the check-in staff at Sydney Kingsford Smith airport. Passengers were queuing for check in as it was shown as being open for this flight on the overhead monitors however, the ground staff were all standing behind one desk chatting, laughing, hugging each other and not one desk was open yet. After standing for half an hour and a now huge queue having developed with several people going over to ask what was going on check-in finally opened. Once we eventually got to the bag-drop counter we were greeted by an unfriendly man who answered my request to print off our boarding passes with 'obviously'. Not a good impression. Overall the experience of flying with Etihad was just fine, nothing more or less but I would definitely try another carrier for a long-haul flight before ever choosing them again as even though they were the cheapest option it certainly shows.

### "refused lounge access"
Brisbane to Heathrow via Abu Dhabi. Really disappointed with the customer service I have received today with Etihad as I have been refused lounge access as a silver member. It clearly states on the website "As an Etihad Guest Silver member, you also get lounge access, priority check in, 25% extra Tier Bonus Miles and so much more. Apparently this is only in Abu Dhabi so I asked if they would make an exception today as this clearly needs rectifying on the website but was still refused. I will now return to Emirates as their customer service far outweighs that of Etihad. I'm still shocked that they wouldn't let me in as a goodwill gesture and to keep me as a loyal customer in future.

### "Worst airline I have traveled"
Delhi to Dublin via Abu Dhabi. Worst airline I have traveled. They don’t respond to your calls they have attitude problem if you ask for water, they say go and get it yourself we are busy - and what they were doing they were busy chatting and eating bananas. The worst part came when we were about to fly back from London to India my friends 2 year old baby started crying as he was not comfortable sitting with the belt so her mother took her into her lap - the air hostesses came and started shouting that you can’t do this the baby has to sit on chair with the belt. My friend told her get the extension and let him sit on my lap but she never agreed and forcefully held the baby and strapped the belt very tightly around him and he started crying loudly because of pain but she said let him cry but he will sit like that only. So my request to you guys kindly avoid this airline because of the discourteous and unprofessional staff.

### "Emirates is much better"
Not Verified | I was really looking forward to this flight as I was trying Etihad airways for the first time .Check in at Dammam was easy and the agent assigned me the emergency exit row seat for free but the boarding was not good as we waited in the jetway for 20 mins with no air-conditioning in the 45 C heat. The aircraft in the DMM-AUH sector was an old 320. A small snack was offered on that short flight and the IFE was unresponsive which annoyed me. We landed AUH on time but the connections in AUH is horrible. Very long queue for security check and I hated this terminal. The flight to BLR was delayed by 2 hrs because the aircraft arrived late. The boarding was extremely chaotic and there was no AC in the boarding area inspire of 46 C heat along with humidity later in the day. The aircraft was a newer A321 with good touchscreens but the selection of movies is not great The cabin service was good and food was excellent along with drinks offered. The downside was that one lavatory wasn't working which led to queue across the aisle .We landed 2 hrs later than our scheduled landing time .The cabin crew were really good. I expected more from this trip. Emirates is much better in almost all aspects.

### "the worst travel experience"
Well, I have to say my recent flight from Melbourne to Frankfurt with Etihad was without a doubt the worst travel experience I have had, and I travel quite a lot. Not only did they not supply my requested vegan meals on either connection, on the second leg one of the cabin crew spilled very hot coffee on me. Of course accidents can happen but despite letting them know my arm was actually burnt and I needed something for it I had to ask 3 times and wait over 20 minutes before I was brought a poultice. The flowing days my arm was red and a small section blistered. Not supplying requested vegan meals appears to be pretty standard as exactly the same thing happened on the same route almost exactly a year ago, and my colleague who flew the same route in reverse also did not have his vegan meals supplied in March of this year. A complaint to the customer service team was met with a pathetic response - 3000 air miles as compensation. But my flights were booked with Virgin Australia where my air miles are based, and they were not transferable to this program. And what kind of totally inadequate compensation is 3000 air miles to me anyway? As a Gold Velocity member I expect better of both Virgin (whose response was also inadequate) and Etihad. I will never fly Etihad again, and this will have a flow on effect to Virgin as I shift my alliance to QANTAS and affiliated airlines.

### "never be tempted fly them again"
Munich to Perth via Abu Dhabi. Awful flights both to and from Europe. Seats uncomfortable; cabins were extremely cold; staff were sometimes friendly, sometimes not; food was sometimes OK, sometimes not; choice of meals given sometimes, sometimes not; my travelling companion received 4 variations of the same cheese pasta for meals on the return route. Seriously? Breakfast, lunch and dinner. Knocked ourselves out sprinting through Abu Dhabi Airport to make connecting flight after late arrival of first leg and earlier-than-originally-booked departure of next leg. Pleased Etihad will soon not be flying to/from Perth anymore so will never be tempted to fly with them again.

### "could tell they had some cost cuts "
Abu Dhabi to Kuala Lumpur. The first time I flew Etihad in 2015, I had such a bad experience, I vowed to never fly with them ever again. They lost my luggage, expected me to run across different gates in 20 minutes for a connecting flight which I missed and gave all the other passengers with me who missed the connecting flight smack. In fact, we had to fight to get them to put us up in a hotel and get us on the next flight. It took 3 hours to sort out everything. For me, they are the worst airline. This time I had to fly them for work - I had no say in the process and had to go with it. Wear and tear on the plane was obvious, food was mediocre and you could tell they had some cost cuts based on the amount of food that was served and the lack of menus. Flight attendants were OK, not the same quality you would get from Emirates/KLM/Singapore Airlines. I wouldn’t fly Etihad unless you really didn’t have a choice.

### "things were objectively downhill"
Heathrow to Bangalore via Abu Dhabi. Outside of the ground services being helpful at Heathrow on our trip from Heathrow to Bangalore, most things were objectively downhill. Seats in economy class are quite uncomfortable. The recliner in the seat did not work at all and the only option provided to us was to switch to an empty seat, if available. There was no vegetarian meal option, despite the fact that our fares included a meal option. The staff were discourteous and made no attempt to procure the same for multiple passengers who demanded it, and merely dismissed the requests stating that only chicken/lamp was available. The food was extremely poor, and the vegetarian pasta which was ultimately given after protests was of very poor quality. I would not recommend ordering it, if given a choice. The staff onboard were not polite and were often dismissive. The entertainment onboard was very good and the headphones, screens etc. worked perfectly. Overall, I would not recommend flying this airline. It is neither the cheaper nor the more comfortable option.

### "it was really disappointing"
Abu Dhabi to Sydney. I expected much. Great plane, I thought, special service level, I thought - but it was really disappointing. The staff are not friendly, the seats are unsuitable for a 14 hr flight, the food supply is mediocre. Only plus is the entertainment system, including "live" world cup football. For future long flights I will definitely choose another airline.

### "was normal wear and tear"
Zurich to Manila via Abu Dhabi. Etihad Airways refused to take responsibility for the damaged bag on my ZRH-MNL flight. They claimed that Delsey made an inherently defective bag which is why there's a huge dent. After which they then claimed it was normal wear and tear. I fail to see how it's normal wear and tear when that suitcase is almost brand new, has travelled back and forth to several countries, and is damaged on the return leg of my journey.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Not Verified |  I booked my first ever business flight in May, my mistake was booking it with Etihad! I researched business class seats and at the time their 789 came up trumps so I booked, only to be informed a short while later that the aircraft has been changed to the older A330 I think they would have know far in advance that this change was taking effect so should have stopped advertising the 789, and for all those who tell me that I should be ok with any business class seat well no I really dont have to be, I saved along time for this privilege and researched the seats I have contacted Etihad several times only to be told they will do nothing as they dont have to do anything its in the small print! I am so disappointed I have handed over good money for a service that they have just decided they can no longer afford so I am now getting only what they deem is necessary would not recommend this airline to anyone

### "never set foot on them again"
Bahrain to Dublin via Abu Dhabi. Arrived at Bahrain check In due to a taxi confrontation at 16.30 for a 17.20 departure to be met at business class check in by a yawning woman swirling in her chair saying flight closed. To which I replied actually business class is 45 mins before departure, I was dutifully informed I was wrong. What would I know only being a gold member and flying them 10 years. Asked to speak to the Etihad manager, told he was busy  Demanded she call him, she then did and said closed. Told to go to Economy desk manager, hauled three suitcases about another 5-6 minutes to have the manager play with his phone and say call the call centre - 16.41 flight closed. Call Centre agent very hospitable asks to speak to handling agent. Then told you can fly as you've already checked in but the bags cant, but can go on the next flight. Asked can they follow on, told no by handling agent - no communication. Long story short CC agent stated as you have already checked in tell him to place the baggage on the next flight. He refused, Then told I am a non show so ticket cancelled Called the CC 4 times, told they would call me back finally one lady took control and I was asked to pay to change the flight to a flight at 04.30 am. So in the airport for 12 hours. The cc agent reverted that the Etihad manager in Bah who never answered his phone once, stated that I was in the airport at 16.50 , basically calling me a liar. It is now 21.20 , No flght confirmed , sitting in the airport now 4 hours, no update, no flight. I will never set foot on them again, worst experience in travel in 20 years. Liars, incompetence and most unprofessional organisation in a long time. My loyalty is done, shame on you.

### "treat customers so badly"
Not Verified |  I dont understand why is this day of age, with so much airline competition and Etihad constantly devaluing their brand how they can treat customers so badly. My wife and I are both Etihad Gold and have used Etihad Business Class frequently in the last 4 years. We convinced our parents to join our Etihad family account over British Airways and 1 year later the points from their flight have still not credited. You have really let us down with terrible customer service. All we get back for the last 8 months is "we apologize that its taking longer". How is it even possible for points to take nearly 1 year to credit? What happens to the expiry date if they finally turn up? It is so disappointing that I will never recommend Etihad again.

### "regarding carry on weight"
Los Angeles to Abu Dhabi. Worst customer service in the check in point. They gave us a hell of time regarding carry on weight. In our flight they have these seats with better leg room and they won't let us move to it, they leave it vacant rather than giving it to us.

### "didn't help me find my bag"
Abu Dhabi to Cairo. Etihad lost my bag in February and didn't try to help me find my bag or compensate me till today. I went to the airport 4 times in Cairo and 4 times in Abu Dhabi. Etihad staff in Cairo they kept telling me Abu Dhabi Staff lost it and they didn't load it from there. When I contacted Etihad staff in Abu Dhabi airport they said Etihad staff they lost it in Cairo. Shame on you - for me you lost my bag, I don't care which destination did.

### "taken cost cutting too far"
Sydney to Paris via Abu Dhabi. I have been flying to Paris every year for the last 12 years. Never have I been so hungry on the plane! Standards have gone down so much! On a 13 hr flight, we got served 1 main meal and then nothing for 7hrs. Not even a small snack. For 7hrs they did not even go around with a tray of drinks! There was nothing made available in the galley. No menu. In previous years they would hand out a menu. Not anymore. So they go around and say "Chicken or lamb" up to you to work out what it is served with. No cheese, no bread roll. This is cost cutting taken to the extreme. You will also not see any wines or spirit on the trolley, by hiding it they certainly hope to reduce cost. (Remember you have no menu to see what alcohol is on offer) Small toilet bag is now an extra at $22usd (from memory). This used to be complimentary. This was my last flight with Etihad. They have taken cost cutting too far.

### "flight was punctual and safe"
Frankfurt to Abu Dhabi. Even if the Check-In was pretty fast the staff was unpolite and hard to understand. Boarding however was starting early and as a result of it it was completed 10 minutes prior departure. In my opinion the Economy of Etihad is good. Entertainment has a huge variety. The flight crew was alright however the scale is -1 since several crew members were busy checking their whatsapp messages instead of saying goodbye to the passengers upon arrival to AUH. Food was very acceptable and drinks have been served 3 times and at any time at your seat if you called them. Eventually the seat was comfortable with beyond standard space. The flight was punctual and safe.

### "Just awful customer service"
London to Mumbai via Abu Dhabi. I flew to Mumbai in February 2017 and submitted a retro claim for the air miles. This claim was submitted only 9 days after the flight but Etihad guest failed to credit the miles. When preparing for another trip to India this year I noticed only then that my guest miles were too low, the legitimate claim for my previous journey had not been applied. I rang customer services who understood my situation and could see my claim on the system, they emailed the retro claim department and suggested I do the same attaching the original claim email. I received an email saying simply that because the flight was more than 6 months ago the miles cannot be credited. I appealed; I once again attached a copy of original claim, and got exactly the same response. I spoke to customer services again. They seemed incredulous that this could not be resolved as it was their error, and they sent another message to the retro claims department. I appealed again myself. And got another email saying the claim is over 6 months old so tough luck. I complained. And received yet another email worded exactly the same as the others! No apology! No acknowledgement of their error! Not even a recognition that my claim was submitted correctly within the 6 month period! No explanation of how my legitimate claim was not processed correctly in the first place! No suggestion of how else this matter could be resolved or compensated for! Just awful customer service.

### "crew were not friendly"
Karachi to Los Angeles via Abu Dhabi. The seats were very uncomfortable and small. The food was worst. They skipped breakfast. I asked why they did not serve breakfast, there was no answer. On a 16 hour flight from Abu Dhabi to Los Angeles, they served a meal twice times and the second meal was served only at the last moment. The sandwich served between the two meals was not edible due to very poor quality. We were hungry throughout the flight. There was no backup plan. There was no fruit basket during the flight while the crew were enjoying eating fruit. The crew were not friendly and had no sense of care for the passenger. If a passenger is hungry or not able to eat their low-quality food, they had no issue.

### "Very unprofessional"
New York to Cairo via Abu Dhabi. Very unprofessional. They changed my checked in seats and had to fight in both flights to sit next to my wife. They put us all the way at the end of the business class next to the kitchen. 11 hours of kitchen noises / flight attendants in and out. We felt so much pressure just talking to many people in order to get your service done. Food was average. Breakfast was not offered and I guess you have to ask them. I have been through many airlines flying first and business class, I never experienced such unprofessionalism. Filed a complaint, no one even bother to contact.

### "never fly with Etihad again"
Bangkok to Heathrow via Abu Dhabi. I am very unhappy with the airline website and their chaotic seating selection and bidding system for upgrades. I am an older flier and the seat comfort and accessibility is very important to me, but you are unable to book seats until 48 hours before take off, which I think is unacceptable. In addition to this you can bid for upgrades or neighbour free seats. We did this and were offered neighbour free seats on the Abu Dhabi to London leg of the flight, which were subsequently withdrawn. In the meantime we had paid for extra leg room seats and charged for these. On check in we did not have the extra leg room seats, and had been allocated individual seats in different sections of the cabin. The ground crew person at check in could not change this, so we were told to go to the transfer desk in Abu Dhabi where we were given the neighbour free seats we had asked for. It has since taken me 2 months to get a refund of the first seats. In general the seats were very cramped and uncomfortable, and on the first section of our journey we had no option but to sit in an ordinary seat. We are also vegetarian and I ordered an Asian vegetarian meal which is normally acceptable on most flights, however it was very poor. My husband found his lactose-ovo meal disgusting, and could not eat it. Abu Dhabi airport is also awful. It is cramped and scruffy with hardly any comfortable seating, and extortionately expensive food. I will never fly with Etihad again.

### "staff were friendly and willing"
We had a great experience and the staff were friendly and willing to help as always. We flew from Abu Dhabi to Male (Maldives) for our honeymoon. We would like to fly with Etihad Airways again for sure!

### "Etihad is on self-destruct mode"
I was traveling on Etihad Airways to Singapore. I am a Platinum guest with the airline and some of the perks include 20 kg extra on top of my 40 kg. I had a total weight of 64 kg total and being a frequent traveler no airline would even stop at that. At the check-in counter I was asked to pay for the extra weight a total of 450 AED (approximately $120) even if I had 1 kg extra! The check-in staff were indifferent about anything I said and I had to remove everything and carry in my backbag. I ended up with back pain and at the end the weight ended up in the plane, only on my back! I don't see what's the point beside having unhappy customers (even premium ones). Etihad is on self-destruct mode after they posted massive losses and what's worse is that it was not due to operational costs but rather poor investment decisions that are being taken on their customers.

### "Food is mediocre"
Abu Dhabi to New York JFK. Paid 8k for a business class ticket and the service received is terrible. Horrible airline and dismissive snobby staff. Will never fly with Etihad. Fly Emirates, they actually pay attention to you. Food is mediocre and you feel as if you’re not valued.

### "I am totally disappointed"
Mumbai to Bahrain via Abu Dhabi. The food what we are getting in flight is also not good and sufficient. While i return from Mumbai to Abu dhabi on 2nd morning flight i reached so early and asking for seat they told it is overbooked and window seat is not available. Food from Abu Dhabi to Bahrain a small piece of cake and water bottle. That would be my last flight with Etihad and I will never recommended Etihad. As a UAE airline I thought it will be at par with Emirates but I am totally disappointed.

### "food and service horrible"
Amsterdam to Phuket via Abu Dhabi. One of the worst airline I've ever been on. Very bad food and the plane is out of date. The in flight entertainment was terrible, both the screen (very pixelated and small), the headphone (fuzzy noise) and the content itself. We have to wait about 20mins after the flight took off to be able to use it and they disabled it 30mins before landing. I thought I was just unlucky and after my transit, in Abu Dhabi we'll get onto a better plane; wrong, I didn't think this was possible but the plane we changed into was even worse. When we landed in Abu Dhabi we have to wait around 15mins for a bus to take us to the terminal. The airport was also not anything like other Middle Eastern airports like I've been to, it was dull, old and small. The food and service were horrible.

### "the worst service we received"
Kozhikode to London via Abu Dhabi. This year with economy class the worst service we received so far, just like charter airline. We would like suggest attention on food and service for the elderly and disabled bit more care as well.

### "Very disappointed"
Sydney to Amsterdam via Abu Dhabi. My flight that I originally booked changed. Received confirmation and everthing before flying. But when I got to the airport they couldn’t get me a seat because apparently I didn’t pay for upgrade or changing date. I’ve been waiting 2hours now! I flew with them few times before but this time really make consider to fly with them again. I didn’t change the flight time. I actually paid for another extra day accommodation because of the flight canceled. It was their mistake and now they make me look like a fool waiting for ages, no seat available for me. Very disappointed.

### "Very poor in-flight services"
Very poor in-flight services, food and beverages and overall value for money for economy class compared to other airlines I have flown to New York like Qatar, Cathay, Emirates. Very disappointed and will most likely prefer not to travel again with Etihad Airways. They don't even have lotions in their rest room or provide a mini kit for long haul flights and encourage passengers to purchase instead. They did not have enough vegetarian selection and they had provided extra bread as a compensation on a 14 hr flight. Do not have snacks, again they have a selection of snacks for purchase. It was very weird to me as the other airlines I had travelled to NY before had been very different and much much better compared to Etihad.

### "thinking of flying with Qatar"
Melbourne to Belgrade via Abu Dhabi. I have been using Etihad for the last 7 years, initially we were happy with the service. Later on we joined Etihad guest programm, as 4 of us from our family traveling often , and that helps to earn miles. In the past we often didn't get credits for our flight, so we tried to do retroclaim by ourselves but sometimes it didn't work when we upgraded from the economy into business class. We would write to retroclaim centre and that would help, but sometimes even that wouldn't help and we had to ring, but eventually the problem would be sorted out. The last flight of my wife hasn't been credited for a long time but now we need these miles soon in order for us to book the next flight. Despite writing to retroclaim and ringing Etihad which has got the call centre in Belgrade, nothing helped. In the last 7 weeks I rang the Etihad call centre in Belgrade four times and was disappointed how they handled my concern. When I rang for the third time I explained tat I needed these miles in a 10 days time in order to book the next flight. I expected help as I earned the gold Etihad guest card after all these years. The operator  promised to me that she would personally take care of the situation and in 10 days she would update me with the progress by phone call. After 10 days nothing was done so I decided to ring. After waiting for about two and half hours and no one ringing me I rang back and this time spoke to a very rude person who kept interrupting me and basically told me to just wait as they can't help. I am thinking of flying with Qatar from now on as I heard they are excellent.

### "Everything is by the book"
London to Sydney via Abu Dhabi. Everything is by the book with this airline, won't accommodate any flexibility or minor requests. Simple request to have the new baggage policy apply for my trip (1x23kg vs 30kg total) and or options for bringing a second bag. No avail, only option was to pay for a second bag at a ridiculous rate or $900+AUD, even your call centre staff were appalled. I simply wanted to travel with 2 bags to ease the load, but no, you can't even accommodate that. Why is this flexibility important? If something goes wrong, I want an airline that can understand an issue from a human's perspective and not simply throw policy, terms and conditions.

### "will avoid Etihad in the future"
Bangkok to Zurich via Abu Dhabi. Lady at luggage drop first discussed whatever it was for 10 minutes with another passenger, then let a couple unpack and repack their suitcases instead of sending them away to do that elsewhere. Luggage drop is luggage drop, please! My aisle seat that I had chosen during online checking was changed to a window seat. When asked why, no proper answer was given except that the plane was full, the plane is no more or less full whether my seat is changed or not, so this could obviously not be the reason and my aisle seat hat been free when i had checked in. Obviously, they gave it to somebody else who had checked in later than me. After boarding, cabin crew tried for a full half hour to find an aisle seat for a drunk passenger because he said he might need to go to the toilet quickly. I see, drunk hooligans get their wishes filled, on the expenses of other passengers! Then the crew ordered five (!) different people to take the seat beside me, only to make them change again to yet another seat and another seat. What good is online check in if you the crew changes the seats whenever and for whatever reason they please? If a family with 7 people is too stupid to check in online in due time, then let them sit in separate rows and distant seats and don‘t make it the problem of other passengers. Next, the crew chatted again and again with a mother with two young kids instead of serving my and other passenger‘s food. All in all, flight was heavily overbooked, check in and boarding complete chaos, and the crew openly and heavily preferred some passengers over others. I will avoid Etihad in the future whenever possible!

### "lack of engagement from Etihad"
London to Sydney via Abu Dhabi. Very disappointing that Etihad have twice substituted an A380 with a Boeing 777 on a 13+ hour flight from Abu Dhabi to Sydney. The Boeing is older, noisier with far less space than the Airbus. Etihad heavily promote the A380 on all their media platforms. I have paid on average about £3,500 each trip with my decision based equally on the aircraft as well as the airline. What is most disappointing is the lack of engagement from Etihad when I have complained. It appears the concept of customer service is quite an alien one. Oddly on both occasions when Etihad have used 777s instead of the promoted A380s, citing “technical issues”, the. A380 appears to be far from full as a 777 could not accommodate all passengers. Will think hard before booking with Etihad again.

### "What a disappointment"
Sydney to Rome via Abu Dhabi. I booked my tickets over the phone with a call centre and the experience was excellent. I was assured as a Velocity Gold Member I would have lounge access in Abu Dhabi both ways, in Sydney and in Rome. I was told only that my changed booking from Bangkok to Danang would not be with Etihad but with Bangkok Airways. I gave the call centre staff member all 3 Velocity membership numbers as we are a family pooler. They were recorded duly. So, all good. I then also, as a precaution, emailed Velocity and Etihad again to confirm lounge access and received a response from both airways advising of lounge access details. Everything was great at Sydney except I was told they could not print off my boarding pass for Abu Dhabi to Rome as there was a problem with their software. Never mind, these things happen. We experienced the lounge in Sydney and it was, it has to be said, pretty solid. Food and drink were on the mark, and service was good. On arrival in Abu Dhabi, however, things started to unravel. We were shuffled to 3 different places before I was able to be issued my boarding pass. Then off we went to the lounge. On arrival at Al Rheim lounge we were advised we could not access as our forward journey to Rome was operated by Alitalia. Despite the emails I had from both airlines, no go, as it was a codeshare flight. I was advised to write a complaint to Etihad once we were back. So, we wiped our losses and paid for another lounge. On the way back, no lounge in Rome, but we were allowed access to the Al Rheim lounge in Abu Dhabi. However, when we arrived back, things grew worse. I lodged a complaint with the details and evidence. Then we waited for our points and waited. And waited some more. Finally we lodged a request with Velocity and waited the 2 months. We then contacted Velocity again and they said they would need to escalate the issue with Etihad. We were also told by the attendant at Velocity Gold member inquiries that Etihad were "known" for this type of behaviour and often allocated points and status credits incorrectly. It has been a lot of work to try and get this mess sorted out. Since January when we wrote a complaint to Etihad we haven't even had a response. It has to be said that for the 3 of us, it was our first and last experience with Etihad. What a disappointment.

### "Service was pretty bad"
Toronto to Dhaka via Abu Dhabi. No more flying with Etihad Airways. Service was pretty bad from Toronto to Abu Dhabi. I never had such a bad food like this. All very spicy and passenger don't have choice. I flew with them few years ago and food was pretty good. Also fleet was quite old for long range (13 hrs) flight. The table doesn't hold the tray.

### "cabin service was terrible"
Flew biz class from Abu Dhabi to Paris, though economy Bangkok-Abu Dhabi. On the first segment (B-777) the seats were very tight and the food service poor, to be charitable. Worse was the biz class to Paris. Though the A380 seating was fine, the cabin service was terrible - disinterested and abrupt flight attendants and an incredibly limited selection of food and drinks, given the price and the 7.5 hour flight. I often fly Qatar on this route and there is really NO comparison in standard. Will go back to Qatar (or Emirates) rather than try to save a few EUR with the sub-standard Etihad.

### "Etihad stated it was a system error"
Rome to Johannesburg via Abu Dhabi. Flew with them in December and back in January. I ordered a special meal when booking the flight as I am gluten intolerant, I checked 2 days prior to the flight to confirm it was on the itinerary which it was and called the day before the flight to confirm. On the flight however it was stated that it was not ordered and I must not have ordered in advance, I explained that I had ordered it several months in advance and confirmed but the impression they gave was that I was not telling the truth. The Senior on board provided me with some fruit and the salad from the meal but no real meal was able to be given. She was very apologetic and took note of it on the system so that on the return I would receive the meal. However on the return the same issue happened, the crew member was far less apologetic and insinuated that I had not booked it properly. I was given only an apple for the flight. I complained and Etihad stated it was a system error, just not sure how the error could have happened twice. Staff should be made aware that system errors happen and should not make assumptions that the issue is on the passengers side. Should possibly have more information of the ingredients (allergen list) in the meals provided so if the error happens you can see if any of the meals on board would be suitable.

### "Do not fly with Etihad"
Manchester to Phuket via Abu Dhabi. Do not fly with Etihad. We paid more for the flights with etihad over a lesser-known airline as we wanted to guarantee a seamless journey. Wrong. Firstly, we were sat separately on 3 out of 4 legs of the journey The online check in didn’t work, so we had no choice. 3 our of 4 of my seats did not recline, but the seats in front did. This meant that on each leg of the journey I was cramped up for several hours. I am fairly small, so I can only imagine how frustrating this would be for anyone of a larger stature. Next up, they overbooked the final leg of our flight by over 20+ people and point blank refused to let us on. They rerouted us resulting in a 12 hour wait in Abu Dhabi airport. No hotel. No apology. One extremely rude member of staff dealt with us who was nothing but arrogant about the whole situation. This delay has had major implications on us both financially (kennel for an extra day for 3 dogs and business implications) yet Etihad merely issued us a ‘meal voucher’ which afforded us a soft drink and pack of grapes. Utterly disgraceful. Also, do not be fooled by the ‘luxurious’ lure of this airline: the aircraft are old and uncomfortable. The screens are older than me and on each journey we heard at least 2-3 people near by whose screens didn’t work at all. No chance of changing seat in that case, they overbook each flight, remember!

### "one doesn't expect such attitude"
Abu Dhabi to Manchester. Don't want to fly Etihad again. On one ticket my husband and I got different seat allocation. Upon requesting in aircraft for seats together, travelling business class the ground staff member jumped into conversation and started aggressively pressuring us to sit separately. The rest is history. Upon reaching Manchester our luggage was sent on another flight. I've emailed Etihad to investigate the matter. They still haven't reverted. In the service industry one doesn't expect such attitude, especially when the airline is adversting themselves presenting a false image. In their next advertisement please show that shouting ground staff member.

### "worst airline I have travelled"
Trivandrum to London via Abu Dhabi. Me and my son (9 years old) was travelling to TRV to visit my parents during the Easter vacation. I tried doing online check in and the airline didn't offer that option at all. On my way to India, we were allocated different seats in different rows on our transit flight from Abu Dhabi to TRV. I was very upset that to be seated separately so we tried to do the check in again so we can be seated together on our way back. I tried check in online and also tried to contact the customer services over phone but I couldn't do it, so we went to the airport very early and requested seats to be together and they passed the buck and requested to talk at the transit desk at Abu Dhabi Airport. The staff at the transit counter said the same thing that the flight is full and told me she would put a comment on system for the boarding staff and they may be able to offer seats together. At the boarding gate, staff mentioned that I will need to speak to the cabin crew. Cabin crew was very hesitant to speak to other passengers and finally I had to personally request passengers if they can swap seats so we can sit together. One of the passenger was so kind and he volunteered to change his aisle seat and took one of the other middle seats that was allocated to me. This is the worst airline I have travelled so far, although they had sufficient time to sort my request, they kept passing the buck and left me with passenger's mercy. The thought of what would have happened during an emergency situation if we were sitting separately still haunts me.

### "used to enjoy the service"
I have been flying on Etihad for the last five years. I used to enjoy the service that Etihad provided. However, on Tuesday March 20th, I found out my flight from Abu Dhabi to Los Angeles was overbooked when I arrived at the airport, and I was forced off of the flight I had purchased months before. Typically, airline companies will ask for volunteers to take another flight. In this case I had no choice in the matter. Secondly, airline companies will usually re-book customers on comparable flights. In this case I was re-booked on a connecting flight even though my purchase was on a non-stop to Los Angeles with minimal compensation. When I emailed Etihad’s customer service, their response was that they would do nothing more than what they already had “in the event of denied boarding.” If Etihad feels that denying people who have purchased tickets is their right, I will no longer be flying with them.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Sydney to Abu Dhabi. Excellent from beginning to end. Seats  spacious with lots if room. Flight staff were  incredible and could not do enough. In-flight entertainment was good and the food lovely. You can now adjust the hardness of your seat which is great when turning it into a flatbed.

### "seat was extremely hard"
Over-rated and disappointing. I routinely fly business class and have flown business class on Etihad on many occasions but this flight from Melbourne to Abu Dhabi was the worst ever. Dreamliner does not accurately describe the aircraft and the cabin crew seemed less than enthused to be on board. The seat was extremely hard and very uncomfortable, although there are apparently features which should allow a passenger to change the softness/lumbar support etc they failed to make any difference. Previous flights on other aircraft have been better thanks to passengers having the ability to alter cushioning etc to suit. The ergonomics for using the seating area are not good. Tray table extends sideways from the console and cannot be moved back or forward, you have to move your seat to gain access to the table, touch screen tv or handset. Etihad has also downgraded the service, no decent amenity pack, no mattress, no pyjamas and food listed in the menu was not available even immediately after take off. The reduction in cabin noise was minimal in my opinion and the cabin was rather cold throughout the 14hour journey. Cabin crew did ask when I wanted to eat but ignored my request to wait for two plus hours and my meal was presented shortly after take off! I have indicated that I would recommend Etihad because of numerous previous journeys but although I have been happy with Etihad in the past I’m no longer convinced that the passenger continues to be considered as important and am not sure that Etihad will be my airline of choice in future.

### "been going down hill quick"
Shanghai to Dammam via Abu Dhabi. I have been flying Etihad for move than 5 years now (reaching gold and platinum status) and the service have been going down hill quick. I have three upgrades which I paid for and yet the system does not recognize this and does not credit me any miles (zero miles). I been calling Etihad and emailing them since January and even until today (end of March) there has been no resolution, just the run around and telling me to wait. Why does it take so long to credit miles to an account, the flight is already in my account but displaying zero miles. Poor service and poor management within Etihad. The flight attendants are rude and poorly managed. On one particular flight there was three Eastern European flight attendants who were best friends and spent most of their time in the galley chatting. So avoid the first and last row in business class due to this noise or just avoid Etihad all together.

### "very mean with the drinks"
Bangkok to Manchester via Abu Dhabi. Never again! On all 4 flights we found the staff to be unfriendly and ignorant. Upon asking the stewardess if she could find a seat next to my partner (which we had been assured was sorted on checking in), she just said “ flight is full”. They are very mean with the drinks, no miniature bottles, just a bottle on the trolley which was sparingly measured (I got nasty looks when I asked for a “ large” one) unlike Emirates who were very obliging with anything you requested. Toilets and aircraft overall seemed grubby. There were no menus to check what was on offer and what was on offer inedible unless you were starving due to queuing for hours to check in (even after online check in). The in flight entertainment was very poor compared to Emirates, mostly geared towards Arabic travellers, esp the music. Very limited selection of films and the “news” was about Etihad,  what a joke! Feel sorry for those who payed top whack for their ticket.

### "an excellent experience"
Flew Etihad on a business trip to Australia in March. All in all an excellent experience from start to finish. Got an upgrade on the AUH to SYD (A380) leg which was an amazing experience. Cabin crew on all flights were excellent, attention to detail is great and they were really engaged. The free style dining service on Etihad Business and First really works as your body clock can differ on each flight. Abu Dhabi airport is a bit dated, the new airport will be very welcome when open next year. Excellent experience!

### "why unfriendly cabin crew"
Frankfurt to Colombo via Abu Dhabi (B787 and A320), returning Colombo to Rome via Abu Dhabi (A320 and A330-200) with Etihad. Food was excellent, design, easy check-in through the app and good information in general. Clean aircraft, nicely equipped. In-flight entertainment had its bugs, had to restart it a couple of times during the flight. So everything quite good, but why do you seem to have only unfriendly cabin crew members? On each of the four flights the stuff seemed to be annoyed right from the beginning of the flight; only their grumpy faces made our flights less enjoyable!

### "the return flight was terrible"
We were flying Washington DC to Bangkok return via Abu Dhabi. The first flights to Bangkok everything was smooth and perfect then the last leg of the return flight was terrible! We had paid for extra leg room seats as it said on the check in and when we boarded the plane we were sat in regular seats. The flight attendant told us that we paid to sit closer to the front of the plane - I explained to her multiple times that, that’s not what it said on the website but I  will take it up with customer service because obviously she couldn’t do anything about it. Once getting back to DC I called the Etihad customer service and was put on hold for 20 mins - when someone finally picked up the phone she was extremely rude! Was no help and then once i asked for a manager she said there wasn’t one. She referred me to an email address and hang up. So I send the email and still get no response! Today i call the airline back and get somebody else who also tells me there is no manager and that the lady gave me the wrong email. And there is nothing he can do.

### "Cost cutting evident"
Flew Bangkok to Abu Dhabi. Pot luck with a successful low bid for an upgrade. Check in slowed by difficult passengers intent on shipping luggage far in excess of their allowance with consequential prolonged debate with the local agent. Etihad use a generic lounge at Bangkok which is adequate and no more. Early boarding so ample time to settle into my seat and a prompt departure. Although only six years old the more traditional seating arrangements on the 777 appear dated compared to the 787s, for example, but actually to my personal preference, more private and ample room to stretch out. Cost cutting evident, no amenity kits distributed with only basic eye-pad / ear plugs / flight socks available on request. Food and drink menu limited compared to what was available in the past - no offer of food on demand, the vegetarian fettuccine dry and tasteless. Staff attentive though not proactive with the distribution of water or other soft drinks during the flight. Entertained myself watching live English football and an early James Bond film. No free wifi. On time arrival on an air bridge at Abu Dhabi, which is exceptionally rare for Etihad. Unfortunately a one hour delay recovering baggage due to, as I subsequently discovered, intervention by Customs. Beyond Etihad's control but I was not the only business class customer left scratching their heads as to why their baggage had failed to appear. A little information smooths the feathers.

### "but never again Etihad"
Kuala Lumpur to Zurich via Abu Dhabi. From Abu Dhabi the aircraft changed in last minute and everyone was given a new seat number. No chance to get your seat. Staff not friendly. I asked ground staff, at the gate and in the airplane. No one really cares about. Always giving standard response to get you away. Was expecting more, but never again Etihad. Flight and baggage delayed. I read the other reviews before ordering and thought people exaggerate. But so many reviews are saying the same.

### "never have such experience"
Chennai to London via Abu Dhabi. I waited 3 hours but end of the time need to run. Checkin counter they open only 4 or 5. Customs very long line take more then 30 minutes in small airport. They did not allocate right seats we are in 12 row, they want to shift to 9 row because it’s emergency exit, saying they offered free today otherwise if cost. I never have such experience.

### "service has become indescribable"
Dallas Ft Worth to Abu Dhabi. My wife travelled via Etihad Airways on 7th March, connecting on Jet Airways to Pune. She had the worst airline experience ever. Airport Staff was not cooperating at all. She wanted to upgrade her flight to Business class but they didn't care for that. There was a single toilet in each section and a was a huge line in front of each rest room. It was taking almost an hour to get your number. Food was pathetic. After asking many times, they were giving water and less than half a glass. She was thirsty and hungry 15-16 hour flight Overall, looks like this airline is going through patch and its "service has become indescribable". Avoid using this flight as much as possible.

### "serious cost cutting at this airline"
Sydney to Munich via Abu Dhabi. No chauffeur service except in Abu Dhabi or generally have first class facilities at many airports. The first class seating is  good although the narrow beds are desperately hard. Food has never been at the best standard despite great efforts by many of the crew. First class check-in at Sydney Airport was shared with economy passengers the reason given that there was only one first class passenger. In reality there were several upgrades. The lounge is shared with business class and is underwhelming. Service was poor. Upon requesting assistance to the aircraft I was advised as I was not a Residence passenger no assistance would be available. The person was close to being abusive. In flight crew were helpful and polite on both legs. At Munich Airport a car which had been ordered failed to turn up and a circus like series of telephone calls commenced. The airport bus proved more reliable. There are all the signs of serious cost cutting at this airline at every level and premium passengers are paying the price for seriously flawed management decisions made in the past. The ground staff at Munich have been wonderful, at least those working for the airline. There have been many forced redundancies and sadly some who have left were the competent and service oriented professionals at different locations. London staff are particularly unhelpful. The airline is clearly not interested in maintaining high level service. After perhaps fifty flights in the front section one has to wonder if it is worth the loyalty.

### "crew members friendly and helpful"
Had a nice experience with Etihad on my last trip from Abu Dhabi to Amsterdam. We were travelling with our baby and the front row seats with bassinet was a big help. The crew members were also friendly and helpful. Food was decent. We were happy that the overall flying experience with Etihad has improved from last year.

### "disorganised and unprofessional"
Perth to Peshawar via Abu Dhabi. Etihad Airways delayed its flight from Perth to Abu Dhabi for 7 hours due to a technical issue with the plane and finally took us to Abu Dhabi via Colombo, where we stayed for another 1.5 hours. Upon reaching Abu Dhabi, I was given a hotel room for 12 hours for a layover of 17 and a half hours as I had missed my connecting flight and my new flight was arranged via Bahrain with a layover of another 7.5 hours and no arrangement for hotel or meal vouchers. My original flight was supposed to take 17 hours to the final destination and I got there in 41 hours. Most disorganised and unprofessional as far as customer experience goes. Will never fly with them again.

### "I was really disappointed"
Rome to Abu Dhabi. I am a gold member of Etihad Guest card, and Government Traveler. I flew with Etihad last month from florence to Abu Dhabi and I was flying Business Class. My first comment was on the food as the quality dropped big time. The second and main comment was regarding customer service and how Etihad Baggage claim center handled my claim of lost luggage. The luggage was missing with no tracing for 10 days, and I was trying to call claim center with no luck. I sent emails but the response was not up to the expectation. Finally, after 10 days I received a call from the driver who is delivering my bag with no previous communication and during my working hours. I was really disappointed from the way that Etihad Airways handled this case. I sent them an email last month and till now no one responded back to me nor call me to make sure that I received my bag or if anything is missing. I really hope that this review can reach Etihad so they can pay more attention to these details as they are my favourite airlines till this moment.

### "probably wouldn't fly with them again"
Using Etihad Airways for the first time despite travelling between Colombo and London and Asia in general often. I was very disappointed, seat space seems smaller but my husband had no leg space. He's 6ft and so is used to be restricted but this seemed much less than Emirates or Singapore Airlines, I ordered a low lactose meal and was given vegetarian which was just cheesy vegetables. I explained that cheese is lactose and was told I should order the right meal. I told them I had but they had the wrong one, which they were very nice about but strange they didn't think of this before and instead assumed I made the mistake. I ended up getting a vegan meal which was fine. Also they ran out of diet coke at the first beverage service before they reached us. Not the end of the world but quite random seeing as we were 20mins into the flight and surely not a surprise that diet coke is quite popular? A sign of poor preparation. Flight from Abu Dhabi to Colombo seemed to be a very old aircraft but was fine. Entertainment options good but you cant start using it till after the flight has taken off. FYI all films are censored. Also you have to pay a lot extra for everything, extra leg room was £200 for one leg of the trip (4 legs in total- London to Abu Dhabi and Abu Dhabi to Colombo and return). It seems a bit of a budget pricing model. All round super average and not better than Emirates, Singapore Airlines, Qatar Airways or even BA (I know!). I probably wouldn't fly with them again.

### "I could rate many budget airlines better"
Sydney to Abu Dhabi. Etihad was once perhaps the best airline in terms of service, value, food, in-flight services, and miles program. After years of loyal service with Etihad, I can honestly say they all of these once great features have become degraded to the point where I could rate many budget airlines better in every feature than that of Etihad. Only recently I had an issue whereby they increased the amount of guest miles required to make bookings to most destinations, and this happened to occur whilst I was making two online bookings, and happened a day earlier than it should have. After many back and forth emails and calls to Etihad, the outcome was that I was to blame, and that I made up the story to try and gain extra miles. They robbed me of 45000 hard earned miles and refuse to acknowledge any fault from their system or at the very least come up with a resolution or compromise. And I am apparently a loyal Gold customer and also a government employee, where we are given privilege treatment. I can only imagine how a "regular" customer would have been treated. This is only one of many issues I have faced as their services decline along with their money hungry cost cutting approach to virtually all aspects of their business. It is a real shame. Sadly they assume that customers do not see through their ways, but I can see from the ample bad reviews that customers are not at all happy with Etihad. Perhaps it is time they listened to their loyalty base. I for one will be choosing alternate airline wherever possible - there are many cheaper airlines which have better services now than Etihad.

### "say no to Etihad next time"
Moscow to Colombo via Abu Dhabi. I flew by Etihad a few years ago and it was good last time. I'm pregnant now and we decided to choose Etihad this time because trusted them. But, it was useless. Etihad has no special offers for pregnant women. You can't get or buy special seat with additional space for legs. Cause the problem with mobile version of Etihad site I didn't register the second flight by myself and we must to got boarding passes in airport. We was one of first people in the line. The girl on registration desk saw with attention my documents about pregnancy and gave us seats no. 8. This line located in front on evacuation exit. It means the back doesn't turn down. We knew it just in plane, unfortunately. To be pregnant and seating during 4 hours in one pose impossible! Our return flight has a 18 hours transit on Abu Dhabi. We ask about opportunity to get free hotel. And answer was no. Can we pay for the room? The answer was no. We will say no to Etihad next time, like they answered to us.

### "Very irresponsible airline"
Tehran to Sydney via Abu Dhabi. Very frustrated from their customer service. They closed their offices in Iran and don't operate in that country anymore. My mum bought her ticket through them before they close their offices. They moved her ticket to Emirates and My mum needs to change her return ticket and fly soon due to her mum being sick. I called them and they refused to change her ticket because it's been changed once. I kept explaining her ticket changed by force because Etihad forced her to change the airline only. Date of the flight was the same but they refused it again. Now my mum needs to buy a new ticket and lose $2000. Very irresponsible airline. Its not passenger fault that you guys don't work in that country any more, you should take responsibility for that

### "The service was awful"
Manchester to Ho Chi Minh City via Abu Dhabi. The service was awful from start to finish. Check in staff were not polite, staff on the plane rude and overall very disappointing. I needed to change my return flight and the customer service were no different. I was offered £260 to change the flight which is extortionate. I have flown with Emirates previously and had no problems changing for £100. I needed to make sure that my partner could pick me up from my destination so i had to hang up and call again the following day. I had no choice but to pay for the change. I then proceeded to call the customer services again the following day and they said that the cost is now £357. It was explained that the £260 was a special price on the day. With no choice I had to proceed. The plane was dated and overall staff made the journey the worst flight I have ever experienced.

### "found  business class to be very good"
London to Manila via Abu Dhabi. Checked in for the flight at Heathrow - am Etihad silver so can use the Business class desk to check in etc. Had a good chat to the lady who once she saw I was going to Manila was interested. Collected by boarding passes for the 2 outbound legs and headed to departure area. I was sat in boarding zone 5 so lot of people in gate area. Handed pass to be scanned and was pulled to one side and given a new boarding pass having been given an upgrade to business class which was a very nice surprise. Boarded via the upper jetway, warmly welcomed by cabin crew and took my seat. Had a glass of orange juice and made my food choice from the menu. The whole upper deck on Etihad A380 is premium seating and was very comfortable. 4 seats across in 1-2-1 arrangement however some seats are rearward facing. Seat was comfy and converted into a lie flat bed. Seat has a lift up space for anything loose you might have ie phone or book etc. Large touch screen with side control for the inflight entertainment system. After take off more drinks were served and food service began. You can specify a time to eat on the menu as well. Crew member prepared the table for my meal which I thought was delicious. After clearing away the meal service I settle down to watch a film or 2. Choice is good and operation of the system is quite straightforward. The external cameras on the A380 are a nice touch. Flight departed on time and arrived on schedule and after clearing security made my way to my next flight. Abu-Dhabi to Manila is a Boeing 777 which was looking a little tired inside (12 years old) and I was back in economy. Still a good flight with reasonable food and good cabin crew. Managed to sleep. Flight on time Manila - Abu dhabi flight was the same Boeing 777 and again the food was fine and crew attentive. Flight on time Abu dhabi to London - again on Airbus A380 and was upgraded to business class again. Flight was very good. Food was excellent. Choices were made from the menu before departure. The only minor snag I had was that my seat would not convert to lie flat bed. Cabin crew were able to resolve quickly. Overall I found the business class experience to be very good and would recommend to anyone.

### "shocked by the service"
On 13th December, we had a flight Oslo to Cochin via Amsterdam and Abu Dhabi. Our flight to Amsterdam was delayed with more than 2 hours, so that we missed our flight to Abu Dhabi. Etihad a great job to find us a new flight via Munich to Cochi via Delhi the day after and found us an hotel for the night. However, our luggage were missing in Delhi (we had to pass them through custom) and we had to spend numerous filling forms. Arrived in Cochin, we expected to get our luggage the day after, but it didn't went like this. We had to Call numerous time to Etihad, Delhi / Munich / Amsterdam airport to try to find our luggage. Nobody seemed to know where there were. Finally Wednesday the 20th of December, almost one week later, we got our luggage back. The problem were not finished. The day of our return flight, 3rd January, we were informed at the airport that our return flight Cochin-Abu Dhabi-Amsterdam-Oslo was cancelled, because we weren't on the flight on the way to India. I was standing there early 2am in the morning with my 2 children in the airport, the Etihad staff telling me that we had no way to come back to Oslo before one week later, since all flights in the following days were fully booked. In addition, I was supposed to pay for the return flight myself. I had to book a new flight with another company and got back to Oslo 36 hours later (! ), with exhausted kid, and shocked by the service Etihad airways gave us.

### "disappointed with the attitude"
Dusseldorf to Ho Chi Minh City via Abu Dhabi. I am really disappointed with the attitude and the way Etihad response to the customers. Firstly, the meals on the plane tasted not good. Secondly, I had to transfer at Abu Dhabi for 12 hours. Normally, by other flight branch (ex: Emirates), the customers will receive a voucher for staying in hotels or for eating. But I received nothing from Etihad. Morever, the customer service at Abu Dhabi even did not want to answer me. Okay. If you do not need customers flying with economy class like me, I will not book any flight with Etihad anymore. I will accept higher price with another flight organization and of course better service than yours.

### "lack of professionalism and customer care"
We travelled from London to Manila via Abu Dhabi a few days before Christmas with a 1.5 hour stopover in Abu Dhabi. The flight from London was delayed by 1 hour which is no big deal. During the flight as we approached Abu Dhabi, we ended up circling due to bad weather. On asking the flight staff, no one was able to advise what the next steps were. We eventually landed at Abu Dhabi and were advised to go to the Transfer Desk. They told us our plane was still there and to go to the gate. We go to the gate only to be told our seats had been given away and we had been offloaded. We questioned why and they were rude in their response and told us to go to the transfer desk. Someone 'helped' us by walking us to the transfer desk. All we wanted to know was when our next flight would be, which we only found out after queuing behind a 100 people and found out that it was in 7 hours. At no point was any rest place or accomodation advised or given and we had to argue in getting food vouchers rather than being offered them. We managed to see through the next 7 hours only to be confronted with more difficulty. We queued for our connecting flight only to be told we need to check in our hand carry. We insisted we were carrying medicine which we needed to keep, at which point the attendant shouted and threatened to deboard us from the plane if we didn't comply. After much stress managed to eventually get on to the flight. We arrived in MNL and waited for 2 hours in baggage only to find out 2 out of 3 of our checked in suitcases did not make it. As a result we were unable to give gifts and presents to our relatives for Christmas plus our clothes and personal effects were missing. On questioning where are luggage was, there was no explanation and we had to wait 24hrs before they could track our baggage. Etihad eventually got our luggage to us 3 days later although frustratingly no arrangement was made to drop it. They decided to call at 3am and demanded they drop it, irrespective of how inconvenient this was. We decided to rebook our return as the issues and delays stopped us from doing some important things. We called Etihad only to be told it would cost the price of 1 full priced ticket for us both. We explained our challenges on our outward trip but no attempt was made to assist us with our return flight. When we asked them to proceed on the back of the conversation the previous day they opened our ticket (essentially cancelling our original return ticket) they went on to explain it would actually cost the price of 2 tickets rather than 1 which they had previously advised. We argued that we would have only been happy to pay for the price discussed the day before and was not happy they had misinformed us. They left us no choice but to buy new tickets at full price due to an error on their part without considering the previous problems. A lot of this could have been avoided if they looked at helping their customers. Issues happen but under no circumstances should the customers be dealt with such blatant disregard. We have been lucky enough to have travelled with Emirates, Cathay Pacific, KLM, and Singapore whose customer service has been great and unfortunately Etihad do not deserve to be held anywhere near the same level as them. Their lack of professionalism and customer care left so much to be desired. Their follow up and lack of attempt to assist frustrated and tired customers also was shocking for such a high profile company. Avoid using them!

### "the crew handled everything well"
Muscat to Abu Dhabi return in economy. Check-in in MCT fairly swift, in AUH very slow. AUH airport was heavily overcrowded at the time of our departure. Long lines everywhere, relatively slow service, no place to sit. Both flights were full to the last seat, but the crew handled everything well. They were friendly and even managed to distribute small snacks and water on the 50-min hop. Both flights started and landed on time. The planes were a little bit older but fine. Unfortunately this route is outrageously expensive compared to other Inner-Gulf flights. Etihad and Oman Air take every advantage of the missing competition on this route.

### "one of the worse flights"
Chicago to Colombo via Abu Dhabi. This is one of the worse flights I have ever taken. Very poor service followed by very little food for a 15 hour flight. They made a pretty big deal about the size of the bags I was taking as caryons. They made me put my bags in to a container and try to make me pay extra when they do not fit in. Some flight attendants were rude. There were some good people, but overall, I have had much better service before. Flight was late and almost missed my other flight at Abu Dhabi.

### "Quite a few changes"
I have flown on Etihad on previous occasions and it had been a while since I last traveled with them. Quite a few changes since then. The seats are slightly larger than they used to be, the staff are friendlier and they have a full entertainment system for their flights to Calicut unlike the others that fly the same route (except Qatar Airways). I had requested for the Low Calorie Meal which was served much earlier than the rest of the passengers which is always an advantage. What I did not appreciate was that the airline had to add more fuel for the flight to AUH from DMM since it did not carry enough. There was a fog in Abu Dhabi and they were advised to do so, delaying the flight by an hour. We landed with an hour to spare for my connecting flight. After another hour of delays and waiting on the runway on the plane to CCJ it finally took off. I don't blame them for the delay since the fog was really bad.

### "a horrid experience"
I have always been a loyal customer of Emirates but wanted to try Etihad just cause they were offering much lower fares from San Francisco to Hyderabad. The journey from SFO-HYD was decent. They have comparable cabin service to Emirates, but their aircraft are somewhat old. The problem was during the return leg HYD-SFO. Don't ever go to their HYD check-in counter with even a single KG of extra baggage. I had just 1.1 Kg of extra baggage in my combined check-in luggage of 46KGs. I should have accounted for the Finance Textbook I added at the end. But little did I know that it would cause me so much hassle. First I thought they would be lenient and just let it go, but the guy was at the counter was rude and wanted me to pay the extra fee. I agreed to pay the additional price for the extra KG, but supposedly they have a flat rate of $125US. The guy was hurrying me to pay the additional fee and threatened me to get out of the line and to come back after throwing my luggage. He even mocked me that I will get further 15KGs if I buy the extra baggage and I can fill my bags with the Karachi biscuits they were selling at the airport. Terrible service. I was upset by this treatment as I didn't pay so much for such service. I called the manager, who was nice, but he wasn't helpful either. I was ready to throw my luggage, but I was not going to pay after the humiliation. I read their luggage policy and decided to carry my Textbook as a personal item (since they are not allowing an additional laptop bag, but a personal item now which they don't tell you about). It was a horrid experience. I will always avoid Etihad after this incident and wouldn't recommend the airline to my worst enemy. Stick to Emirates if you can!

### "poor service I received"
Manila to Edinbugh via Abu Dhabi. The service of this airline is getting worse, seats are squeezed and food has no quality. I asked three of the flight attendants if they have toothbrush and toothpaste and no one comeback. If I had known that I am travelling with a budget airline type of service I should just pack my dental hygiene kit in my hand carry. I was surprised with the poor service I received.

### "best long haul flight"
Dublin to Abu Dhabi. This was the best long haul flight I have been on. The main course of the meal was lovely, I couldn’t believe it was flight food! I got speaking to several flight attendants who were so friendly and informative. WiFi was cheaper than that of some Gulf airlines and the entertainment was great. I will definitely fly with Etihad again.

### "Worst experience ever"
Toronto to Lahore via Abu Dhabi. Worst experience ever. I always fly with Etihad Airways but this would be the last time ever. There was no leg room, the flight was overbooked and not even cabin space. Staff wasn’t even nice except for just one guy. Washrooms weren’t working, so for 2 washrooms there were lines.

### "you need to up your game"
London Heathrow to Male via Abu Dhabi. What a shambles. First time flying with Etihad and will be our last. Flew business class with my wife from LHR to Abu Dhabi and then onto Male. First flight was late leaving by an hour and despite being first off the plane the transfer at Abu Dhabi, it was shambolic. I have never seen crowds like it or so disorganised. It took one hour to get through and when we arrived at the lounge we had 5 mins there before boarding, time for a coffee only. Boarded the Male flight that departed at 8.40 only to be surprised they were serving lamb and chicken for in my view breakfast. We had lamb at 10.30pm UK time on London flight, was really looking forward to breakfast so ate nothing for a further 4 hours. No snacks, sandwiches or any savoury option available. So thank you Etihad I had no food for over 10 hours. You should be totally embarrassed by the fiasco at your main hub. Clearly you have significant transfers here and it is not fit for purpose. No priority channel until you get 2 yards from business security. This is entirely unacceptable and your food choice should be so much more on a business class flight from your hub. I paid for business class for my wife and I on a wedding anniversary trip and got a poor economy service from Etihad. I had heard so many good things before flying, my experience is entirely different. Finally seating in business class was a fiasco too, we booked flights 5 months ago and still couldn’t get seats side by side in either flight. When we questioned this on the second flight they found 2 business seats together but why couldn’t we book them? Far from a great experience and look forward to reporting on the return leg very soon. Etihad you need to up your game, terrible experience and very poor value.

### "the most horrible experience"
Delhi to London via Abu Dhabi. We choose to fly Etihad Airways on our agent’s recommendation. It was my first and certainly the last time I flew with them. It was the most horrible experience. The cabin crew was very rude and uncourteous. Very uncomfortable seats and the worst part was despite pre-ordering meal I did not get Vegetarian meal. The crew member was unprofessional and told me that meat is all what we have, if u want to take it it’s your wish. My son was given food after waiting for more than an hour. I did not get any food at all through the flight. Overall the worst flying experience I have ever had. Would never recommend flying with them. Even if it is cheaper it is not worth it.

### "The service was slow"
This was my last leg of a flight from Perth to Manchester, after spending some time in the Etihad business class lounge, it was time to board the plane, firstly they do not call you when it is time to board (other airlines do) you have to keep checking yourself. Etihad advertise in their inflight magazine that they have a premium fast lane for all first and business class passengers in other words a fast track, they had the signs up but there was no entry so I had to join the economy long queue and had a long wait to get to my seat. What's the point in paying the extra only to stand in the long economy queues. The service was slow and the staff obviously did not have much food to go around, was not offered much not even the hot roasted nuts that they normally supply. Wish I had read the reviews first before flying Etihad would never have flown with them, stick with Emirates or Qatar.

### "poor service below average standards"
Frankfurt to Melbourne via Abu Dhabi. Extremely disappointed with the poor service and below average standards on our flights. We visit family in Germany every year and having flown other airlines (business class) we took our agents recommendation and flew Etihad Airways for the first time and most definitely the last time. I am taking the time to write this review just on 24 hours from getting home because my husband, daughter felt that we were (and other passengers) inconveniencing the crew. Their negative attitude and lack of professionalism were not acceptable. On a positive note checking in at Frankfurt Airport was excellent, easy and staff were friendly. However, from the moment we entered the aircraft we noticed the cabin crew rushing around, looking very stressed and un politely pushing passengers aside saying, “please move” to get past. At no time were we properly greeted or welcomed on board. The aircraft on our first leg of the journey was old and a bit shabby and the seats were not really comfortable. When we ordered our meal (I requested the lamb dish) I was told they had run out! After dinner was served the staff disappeared and were pretty much non-existent. Fortunately, it was only a 6.5 hr flight. However, the second leg of our flight 12.5 hrs was dreadful. Larger aircraft and seat/bed comfortable, our biggest disappointment again was the cabin crew. Except for one crew member who was somewhat polite the rest of the crew were unprofessional and just not visible during the flight. I requested a meal at about the 6-hr point of the journey and had to wait an hour – the food however (Grouper) was really good! My biggest shock came 1.5 hrs before landing in Melbourne when I woke up and requested a cup of coffee and some breakfast (they did not come to me I had to go to the galley). I was told by the female attendant that the ovens were turned off and they had no hot meals left. I explained that I had several hours in Melbourne to connect to Sydney and asked if I could maybe have a coffee and some toast to which the female crew member said, “you could get some breakfast and a better coffee in Melbourne”. I could give you more details about our whole journey but want to limit by saying I will not recommend Etihad to family and friends and certainly not fly Etihad again. I know that it is not Etihad's fault but Abu Dhabi Airport was also a nightmare - understandably a larger airport than Sydney but even though we were in transit everyone had to go through security checks (applaud this) but was chaotic and over crowed and understaffed. Scary airport! In a few words, very poor service and below average standards – we will stick to Singapore Airlines, Thai and Lufthansa no matter what the price difference is!

### "Extremely disappointed with Etihad"
Abu Dhabi to Geneva. Extremely disappointed with Etihad Airways with which i am a GOLD member and frequent flyer to multiple destinations. My wife, my son and I were supposed to fly from Abu Dhabi to Geneva on January 3rd 2018 for a winter vacation. Upon check-in we noticed that my wife's visa starting date was on 4th of January (which is one date later). We were told that she cannot fly and hence requested to re-book the whole 3 of us for the following day and i showed willingness to pay extra fees for the reschedule. Howeverthe surprise came when we got told that if we do not take this flight 'Jan 3' we will lose the tickets since they were booked with miles. I called the Etihad contact center but there was absolutely no sign of cooperation. The tickets in dollar value are worth more than $5,500 - and I now had lost them all without 1 cent being returned except the tax which was around $510. I have tried all possible and proper ways with Etihad but not one time i was shown any kind of cooperation, their call center agents are all always in a hurry to finish the call as this is a dead case for them. I urge each and every one of you to be careful when booking next with Etihad as i have learnt it the hard way.

### "A little saving not worth it"
I flew Etihad from London to Melbourne and I would not recommend it. It was below average experience with a few good things to consider. Check in process was pretty efficient at Heathrow. The cabin crew were pretty serious and not even saying 'hi', overall pretty average. The food was surprisingly nice, the leg room was alright and the seats were comfortable enough. The entertainment system was ok, but it didn’t work for the first half hour and the last hour of the flight, when I questioned I was told that’s Etihads Policy, which didn’t really make much sense to me. It was pretty boring to sit and watch the flight map for the last hour of the flight. The other interesting thing was the first officer announced that we are traveling along the “Arabian Gulf”, I thought it was called “Persian Gulf”, I checked my google map again and I am certain it is Persian Gulf, it is like saying welcome to Qatar or Saudi once we land in Abu Dhabi. This was pretty stupid to me as I suppose the airlines must be accurate with their announcements. The last thing is Abu Dhabi Airport itself, I know it isn’t much to do with the airline or flight quality, but when you travel with Etihad you have to go past the airport and that airport is terrible, small and cramped with people with super dirty toilets. Overall, I would rather fly with Singapore Airlines, Emirates or Qatar much more than Etihad. A little saving not worth it.

### "Truly satisfying experience"
Moscow to Phuket via Abu Dhabi. Truly satisfying experience. The planes are very new and clean. All flights on time. Very professional ground staff and cabin crew. Very useful assistance during transfer in Abu Dhabi. Extremely comfortable seats. The entertainment system is great - lots of excellent movies and music, not a single chance to get bored. Quite interesting inflight magazine too. There are things to work on, though. The food quality have dropped significantly during the last couple of years - the meal was surprisingly mediocre and not tasty. Also, the Etihad mobile application tends to crash and depict errors causing the necessity to dial the call center for simple operations. The call center is rather useless though. For example I had failed to change my seats via application and asked to do so via call center, but the guy there was trying persistently to convince me, that the seating I required was not possible. Of course the issue was solved in 1 minute by the ground staff at the airport, luckily the seats that I wanted were still available.

### "service is just going downhill"
Trivandrum to Sydney via Abu Dhabi. This is the third time I have flown with Etihad and the service is just going downhill. The first leg of my trip was in Business Class and the second in Economy and there is definitely a difference in the way we are treated. The service in the first leg of my trip was excellent, the cabin staff were cordial and approachable. The second leg was  rubbish, they treated those in economy badly and I'd have to say it's just disappointing. My daughter wasn't feeling too well during the second leg of our trip as it was a long flight, the staff was very rude and passive aggressive to her and it was very frustrating to see. Will never fly with Etihad again, and I do not recommend it whatsoever.

### "disappointed me yet again"
London to Phuket via Abu Dhabi. A very average experience. Check in at London was the slowest I have ever had. The seat studio itself is very good but the seat is rigid. The food took two hours to arrive which on a 6 hour red eye flight is unacceptable. Champagne is a very low end brand and the food wasn't really worth staying awake for. The airline disappointed me yet again compared to Asian carriers.

### "classify the service as very poor"
Toronto to Hyderabad via Abu Dhabi. I was flying from Toronto to Hyderabad, via Abu Dhabi. I would classify the service provided by the airline as very poor. It all started when my meals had to be served, I was offered a vegetarian meal, and I told the cabin crew very specifically that I would like to get a Non-veg meal. She made me wait for about 15-20 minutes and came back and firmly told me that there was no other option but a veg meal. I then requested for a drink, and was told that it would take about 15 minutes, I waited for about 30 minutes and then pressed the attendant button, the next attendant took another 15 minutes to fetch me a drink. My second leg of the trip was from Abu Dhabi to Hyderabad, and believe it or not, I once again was forced to have a veg meal. On my return from Hyderabad to Abu Dhabi, I was to break journey and head to Dubai by the travel coach provided by the airline. I tried to find out where I was to board the bus, but not too many people at the airport were friendly enough to give me the details. On the final route from Abu Dhabi to Toronto, I was confronted at the entry gates by a person who weighed by cabin bag, which was about 1 kg over the restriction, and they turned me back asking me to have the weight adjusted. I couldn't believe that they would be so strict with 1 kg. My overall experience puts me to think if I ever want to fly with this airline again. The cabin crew and the check in crew appear to be doing all the passengers a favor by working for this airline. I am sure if things don't change fast, this airline wouldn't last too long.

### "service I got was very poor"
Washington to Delhi via Abu Dhabi. I will never suggest any Handicapped or the person needing assistance to travel with Etihad or its partner Airline . Etihad treat their passengers who are handicapped with no respect and the service is degraded. I have been the loyal customer for Etihad for past 4 years and flown only their business class multiple times a year. This time I had the health issues and noticed the service they provided was really bad. Asked for the wheel chair and the reply was they they don't have one and I have to walk. This time I requested the wheelchair and the service I got was very poor.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Melbourne to Abu Dhabi. I'd have thought with 2018 the IFE would have been improved sadly not with hardly any proper up to date movies available and a poor selection compared to Qatar Airways. Service by the crew on this flight was very slow indeed and staff all seemed to be Indian and serving Indian customers first. Took an age to get my dessert even after a gentle reminder. Food was pretty good though. I used the wifi internet for messaging and it's not bad value $5 for 30MB and is very useful for notifying family of status etc. Connection remained stable so was quite impressed but then I was only messaging not browsing or any heavy file download etc.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Dallas Fort Worth to Thiruvanthapuram via Abu Dhabi. I have contacted their customer service number in Dallas to confirm my reservations, seat assignments (which cannot be done online), baggage restrictions (again incomprehensible online) etc. Each time you have to go through a maze of menus before you can speak to an agent and the wait times are horrible. This last time I waited for 38 minutes before I was connected and the agent hung up supposedly because he couldn't hear me. Besides this, every agent that I spoke to is extremely rude beginning with an endless stream of questions to verify your identity all asked in the most impolite manner. I am already not looking forward to a pleasant experience when I fly tomorrow. I am rating the ground service, seat comfort and cabin staff service in advance since these are mandatory fields.

### "little extras once offered have disappeared"
Perth Airport was its usual excellent self. Unlike others, Perth appears to have little difficulty organizing hassle-free check-in and loading using an air-bridge to ensure a prompt (on the nose) push-back. Can't be faulted. For the flight, the seats on the 787 offer room enough for a six-footer, if a bit hard, but remember to bring your own eye mask and earplugs as these have been consigned to history by Etihad in the name of cost-cutting, probably best to use your own headphones too as those offered were defective. The ordered special meal - vegetable curry - served on departure was perfectly edible but likewise the little extras that Etihad once offered have disappeared. Deja vu as exactly the same meal was served again prior to arrival, which I could not be bothered with - some variation would have been nice, the second meal is not necessary on a 10 hour flight, a good quality snack / sandwich far preferable. Crew attentive throughout so no issues there. Like the live TV on the 787 but otherwise the IFE has similarly been cut back of late. Touch down at AUH was a few minutes early. However, as is the norm, for operational expedience the plane was subsequently parked at a distant location. Suffice it was an hour and a quarter before I eventually arrived in the terminal for the most part stuffed like a sardine in a cold, chronically overloaded bus with many elderly passengers and children. 5 minutes to whisk through the e-gate to pick up my bags that had arrived long since. Rather sad when the management of an airline and / or its principal airport hub treats luggage with rather more respect than its customers.

### "standards have slipped"
Melbourne to Edinburgh via Abu Dhabi return. Still good but standards have slipped and they are clearly trying to economize. Little things like no pyjamas, no amenity kit on day flights, no a la carte menu in the Melbourne lounge. Nothing major but it does all add up. Entertainment this time around was a bit boring. I really struggled to find anything I really wanted to watch. We were in the Boeing 787 going to Dubai. Lovely plane. Only two working toilets though ( I think there should have been three) which meant we had to queue every time once for 20 mins which is a bit ridiculous. They’ve stopped offering chauffeur service outside of the UAE which is a real shame.

### "meal quality is dropping"
I have been flying Etihad since they started. Their meal quality is dropping rapidly you can feel it from trip to trip. My recent trip from Bangkok to Abu Dhabi was an early morning flight, I was flying economy and ordered the omelet, to my surprise there was no bread on the tray. I asked the steward about it and he just looked at my tray and told me there is cupcakes why don’t you eat your eggs with it.

### "not choose Etihad for future travels"
Chicago to Islamabad via Abu Dhabi. I had the most unpleasant traveling experience because of Etihad Airways! Due to time constraints, I had to purchase an airline ticket in a hurry, I chose Etihad, and I paid $2600.00 for a round-trip ticket for what was listed as Economy Flex. It was economy alright but the Flex part was an extreme exaggeration or someone's idea of a cruel joke on the unsuspecting traveler! I saw absolutely no difference between the economy class or the economy flex when it came to the room, as claimed by Etihad. The service was quite below standard, I had ordered a Kosher meal and when I got my meal in a box, half of the items in the kosher meal box were frozen. When I informed it to the air hostess, she told me that she couldn't do anything about that since she cannot microwave the food. I will not choose Etihad Airways for future travels.

### "My luggage was delayed"
Seats were comfortable, but that's the only positive thing I have to say. Food was pretty bad. My luggage was delayed, which I thought it might be. Therefore I asked them to confirm that it was on the plane from Madrid. They assured me that it was - well, it wasn't. I filled in a form at Perth airport, but they didn't give or email me a copy with a case number, so I can't make a claim for necessary expenses. I called their head office several times and got 4 different numbers to call. One was to their old baggage claim partners, who don't work with Etihad anymore. One number was out of service. One was to an office in Abu Dhabi, which was closed, and after 40 min on hold, I gave up on getting through to the 4th number. Furthermore one of my flights was 2.5 hrs delayed, and a week before my first trip, they changed my stopover in Madrid from 3 to 8 hrs. Never flying Etihad again.

### "Never fly with Etihad again"
New York to Dhaka via Abu Dhabi. This is the third time I flew with Etihad. My first flight was in 2015, and at that time their service was good. Now it is very disappointing. New York to Abu Dhabi is 12 hour flight and they do not provide brush and toothpaste kit, eye cover for sleeping etc. My remote control for calling the flight attendants for help, reading books, and watching movies etc. was not working. Food was horrible. Literally no food choice and very poor quality. The washroom was not properly cleaned, even in the very beginning of flight. If you complain, the flight attendants are very angry. I wonder how they can be in business if they continue this way! Never fly with Etihad again.

### "would not recommend this airline"
Dallas Ft Worth to Thiruvananthapura via Abu Dhabi. This is one of the worst customer service airlines. If you buy through American airlines, which is what I did, you have no place and are treated as second-class. We had two children, with one child they would promise us bassinet or bulkhead seats and we would not get them. The phone customer service was the worst I've ever had. I was having trouble with getting a boarding pass.They basically told me we can't do anything about it. You're not my responsibility. They wouldn't give us a boarding pass until we entered the airport. During the flight the stewardesses were really nice, but the food was very limited in economy. The basic issue is that they're trying to reduce the benefits of economy for the benefit of business class or first class. I would not recommend this airline if you're going to India.

### "no one cares about the customer"
Munich to Bangkok via Abu Dhabi. My flight got canceled the day before departure. I contacted the hotline and facebook but no one cared about me. I spend a whole day to find a way to proceed to my destination. Etihad didn't care in any way, no one contacted me. Even I am a frequent flyer with Etihad only, no one cares about the customer when the flight gets canceled. It was caused by bad weather conditions which I can understand but then I expect that at least someone calls me or send me a mail how to proceed with that problem and nothing happened, if the customer wouldn't investigate nothing would happen. No Etihad flights anymore!

### "been waiting for 3 hours"
Jeddah to Manila via Abu Dhabi. Our flight from Jeddah was delayed due to bad weather in AUH. Upon check in they inform us that the flight is delayed and the advice time was 7:30 but it might take a little longer. We decided to stay in lounge waiting for the new departure (from 5:30-9:30 am). We didn’t catch our flight to MNL as they rescheduled us to tomorrow. 6 hours waiting in Jeddah, we reach Abu Dhabi and waiting for the transit visa so we can stay in hotel - been waiting for 3 hours and still counting. I cannot recommend Etihad anymore.

### "providing quality service"
Manila to Brussels via Abu Dhabi. The flight crews are more attentive and smiling in providing quality service to passengers. A big change from past experiences. I had a combination flight of Business (Manila to Abu Dhabi) then Economy (Abu Dhabi to Brussels). In both flights, service was almost impeccable. There was also an impressive and much-welcomed amelioration in the lounge for Gold members who can now access more exclusive lounges: if flying from Terminal 1, it is now the one beside the Al Reem, which is much cosier than the latter and the food choices are a plenty. If flying from Terminal 3, Gold members are allowed at the Business Class Lounge. Before, I would only have access to this lounge when I flew business. Now, on economy flights, Gold members are welcomed here. The only area that still need improvements are the ground crews in Brussels. You hardly find anyone friendly here in the past but maybe now, I probably was just unlucky to be attended by someone new. Nothing of what I requested was arranged and he was not aware of the protocol for Etihad frequent flyer members. But the one whom he consulted (I supposed someone more senior) was already much better when he assisted, much better than the usual staff you find in the Etihad Brussels counters. I just booked my children's flights with Etihad for January!

### "never fly with this airline again"
Brisbane to Abu Dhabi return. I booked 7 tickets for a tour I ran to India this year and from the very moment I did this things just went from bad to worse. A spelling mistake on one of the tickets cost me $650, the service in every area was just appalling, food and inflight entertainment was very ordinary. Out of the seven people all complained and said they would never fly with this airline again.

### "bed was still very narrow"
Abu Dhabi to Melbourne. First time on the new Boeing 787 and the cabin was new and well laid out. There is seating in the backward position which quite a few passengers were not keen on I noticed along with myself. Flat bed was still very narrow compared to Qatar and Cathay and  its very hard to move & turn over so it does feel a little claustrophobic. Get out of the seat to get into the aisle is very narrow and  not easy to do & I have my doubts if it was in emergency this would greatly hinder you chances of escape. Food was good on this flight and could be had at your pleasure when you needed to. Sadly the IFE is still poor and especially movies are not up to date and lacking in choice! Cabin crew were at-tentative until it was lights out then disappeared unless you buzzed them. Flight left late as seems to be the norm with this airline and arrived late as a consequence. On time departures must be tightened up as after all this is supposed to be a 5 star airline...

### "never fly this airline again"
Colombo to Paris via Abu Dhabi. It was a very disappointing experience. I flew Business class with my son -  on the Abu Dhabi Paris Sector the steward who was taking the meal order from my son said the steak was no longer available and recommended him to have the vegetarian meal - a minute later the steward on my side took my Order and confirmed there was enough of beef on board and served me and my son. Will never fly this airline again.

### "disappointed with the service"
Perth to London via Abu Dhabi. I am extremely disappointed with the service I received. When we checked in I asked if it was ok that I didn't have a return ticket out of the EU. The lady assured me that it would not be an issue. After travelling for 30 hours and waiting for our flight to Portugal from London we were denied access on the plane for this reason. They cancelled my ticket and refused a refund or to help in any way. My boyfriend then had to forfeit his flight to help me get to Portugal. We spent 4 hours in and out of terminals to contact Etihad with them to simply reply that they can do nothing! We then called there call centre just to be told the same thing. Due to such bad customer service we have lost so much money. We had to then spend 250 euros for a new flight just because of such bad customer service and being told false information. So after 30 hours of flying we are down another 500€ and have to spend another 22 hours waiting in an airport for our flight. They also refused to help us find where our luggage was and still have no idea if it will be coming with us on the flight tomorrow. Etihad still say that they can't do anything to help.

### "a satisfactory experience"
Nairobi to Manchester via Abu Dhabi. The service was quite good, particularly on the NBO - AUH leg, and seats were fairly comfortable. I thought the IFE was a bit limited in choice but I was still able to find something to watch. The seats on the Boeing 777 are quite tight but I was fortunate that the plane wasn't full and I was able to have the entire row to myself. For both legs the food was OK and the cabin crew were always hand to provide assistance. Overall a satisfactory experience and I would fly with Etihad again.

### "another disappointing experience"
Frankfurt to Abu Dhabi. Yet another disappointing experience on Etihad. Even though I boarded 30 minutes before take off, the front door was closed already and I had to be in the queue with all other passengers. I was neither accompanied to my seat (2K) nor formally greeted and welcomed back on board even though this should be standard procedure when traveling First. There were neither German newspapers nor any magazines on board, finally a newspaper from the day before was offered to me. My dinner-choice was not available any more and this flying 1st class and being a platinum member with Etihad. Since I opted for fish the only offer I got was the salmon from business-class instead the cod from First. The ‘new’ amenity-kit was another disappointment. While it’s still the same cheap plastic-kit in a fake (now blue instead of black) leather look, the quality and number of items inside have been reduced and the nice little pouch containing skin care products disappeared. Not even a razor is supplied any more. It now basically contains only what the Etihad former business-class kit contained (which has been discontinued). The whole flight through I was never addressed by name, drinks have been only re-filled upon request and even for a hot towel after dinner I had to ask for. Upon arrival we could not de-board first (door 2 was opened first) and were brought late to the arrival hall in an overcrowded economy-class bus. At least passport control was fast and all my bags were on the belt when I finally arrived there.

### "Very good inflight entertainment"
Abu Dhabi to Paris. The aircraft took off 5 minutes before scheduled and arrived 25 minutes before scheduled landing time. So, enough time for transit in Paris Charles de Gaulle airport. Very good in flight entertainment system, should be turn on from embarkation to disembarkation. In flight meals should have been served in accordance with landing area local time, and not 1 hour after take off.

### "A big choice of films"
Paris  to Abu Dhabi. The aircraft took off at time and arrived 15 min before scheduled time of arrival in Abu Dhabi. A big choice of films for inflight entertainment. In flight meal: medium taste and tray too small. Lunch served 1hr after take off  and nothing before arrival (landing time at 8.10pm). The lunch could have been served in accordance with landing area local time.

### "disgraceful cost cutting"
Bangkok to Abu Dhabi. Worst Business Class experience ever! To begin with, Etihad hands out amenity kits to its business class passengers on select routes only, BKK-AUH not being one of those routes. What a disgraceful cost cutting measure. Meal service was lousy. The main dish was lukewarm, my wine glass not refilled once and when the flight attendant took my plate away, she did not even ask if I wanted cheese or dessert. Same flight attendant had to be reminded to return my garment bag to me after landing which she had stored in a closet before take-off. I have been flying with Etihad for many years now. The decline from first to last in class is truly amazing. I am beginning to understand the deeper meaning of their slogan "flying re-imagined"!

### "overall great experience"
Ho Chi Minh City to Edinburgh via Abu Dhabi. I was very impressed with Etihad Airways. The flight was delayed due to weather, so I missed my connecting flight (also Etihad Airways) but the airline had re-routed me onto another flight to reach our destination. My baggage arrived at my final destination on time, without any issues, despite the delays, missed connections, change of route etc. The staff were very friendly,. The seats were comfortable, food was good, and overall great experience! Would fly with them again.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Mumbai to Johannesburg via Abu Dhabi with my parents. The flight Mumbai to Abu Dhabi was supposed to be operated by Jet airways at around 5:05 am. The flight was cancelled due to the runway problem caused by heavy rainfall in Mumbai. After informing, both the airlines tried to avoid the issue by sending us to the counters of other airways. The only thing Etihad did just provide us the customer care phone number in India. I came to know the customer care was unable to re-schedule the tickets until they receive the confirmed report about the flight cancellation from their partner airways (Jet). We really surprised after knowing that customer service can only re-schedule the tickets in normal office hour, even after such kind of emergency. We managed to receive the re-scheduled tickets after 5 hours. Meanwhile, I sent an email to Etihad for the re-scheduled tickets at 6:50 am. Till today, I did not get any response. I lodged the complaint to the Etihad feedback) on 10th Oct 2017. I received the reply on 13th Oct from the Etihad guest relation officer who insisted me to liaise directly with Jet Airways (Note that I lodged the complaint to Jet airways on 3rd Oct and were not interested to discuss the concerns I raised. I am waiting for the correspondence from Etihad till today but Etihad is trying to ignore the issue and insisting to deal with their partner airline. 2. My parents were returning from Cape Town on 31st Oct 2017 and reached Mumbai on 1st Nov 2017. The wheelchair facilities were booked for them in Johannesburg and Abu Dhabi airport for transfer. They did not get the facilities in Abu Dhabi airport. We are waiting for the response from Etihad after lodging the complaint on 5th Nov 2017.

### "more like 3 stars?"
Sydney to Paris via Abu Dhabi. How does Etihad get 5 stars rating, when their true standards are more like 3 stars? I chose them because they were the cheapest ticket (even less than China South Airlines! ), but wish I had paid more. Seats were truly cramped, and the aircraft looked tattered but worse it was quite dirty. Bathrooms were disgusting near the end of the second flight. Food portions very small and cabin attendants seemed very unhappy to be serving (or not!). Used Qatar Airways last February and they are so much better.

### "needs to improve the cleanliness"
New York to Colombo return via Abu Dhabi. Colombo to Abu Dhabi on a small A320 aircraft. The economy class was over 90% full and it was very hot. I informed  to a flight stewardess. She offered me another seat by the emergency exit row, which did not make any difference. Return flight from Abu Dhabi to New York was not a full flight yet it took nearly half an hour for the cabin crew to respond after hitting the button. Finally, we ended up walking to their kitchen every time we needed water. Food from JFK to AUH, the dinner was awful. Coming back to JFK from AUH, the food was excellent! Etihad did not offer me a choice of food for breakfast. Etihad needs to improve the cleanliness of their economy class cabin. Etihad could offer wifi onboard for free or at least improve the service. I purchased 5MB for 30 mins for $4.95 but it lost the connection within the first five minutes, while I still had 4.8MB left. Very disappointing!

### "very unhappy with this behavior"
Dusseldorf to Phuket via Abu Dhabi. Several people in Etihad’s customer service (by email and on the hotline) gave us different answers. This is disappointing and confusing for us. Several times their customer service confirmed to accept our ticket via email on 20.08 and hotline on 07.11 that we will able to check in. They booked us into their system (however only the return flight instead of both flights). After we called customer service on 07.11 again, Etihad employee sent us a ticket (both ways), and confirmed again that with this ticket we will be able to check into our flight. Since on 10.11. one flight was still not visible on Etihad website, we called the hotline again. We were then informed that they won't accept our ticket. We are left confused if Etihad will honor their previous promises. Also we are very unhappy with this behavior. If they make promises they should keep them. If they don't intent to keep promises then better don't make any promise at all. Now we have buy new tickets shortly before we fly, which are very expensive now, comparing to 3 months ago. I already contacted the consumer protection organisation about this topic. Also I want to warn other potential customers to be very cautious before putting trust into them by sharing my story.

### "No responses yet after 3 weeks"
Bangkok to Belgrade via Abu Dhabi. This is not review about the flight itself but the customer service and the user experience. The problem for me started when I arrived at the airport and they noticed that my wife switched my name and surname when registering the ticket. They notified me that the ticket is invalid and I cannot use it at all. I had to buy a new ticket which cost me 2x more than the one I already had. Since the problem was that only name and surname were switched, this is something that is totally unacceptable to me. When I arrived at Bangkok I tried to get in touch with the airline to learn if I can be at least partly refunded for the ticket that I was not able to use. On the web they say to contact them over Facebook page so I did. The response on the messenger took a few hours but they said to send the question over email. So I did. No responses after 5 days. I found online also the email address to where I wrote the same question. No responses yet after 3 weeks except the autoreply that they will look into my request. After not getting any response I tried also calling them. Their phone service is terrible. You are guided through multiple level of selections such as "for english press 1", "if you bought your ticket online press 1". At the deepest level you always reach a stage where they say they explain that you should find you answer somewhere else and that the call will now end. Horrible service, especially since these are all international calls. At just one of these deepest levels I was able to finally get a person to whom I was able to speak. They explained to me that the ticket cannot be refunded and that I can even be happy that they don't charge me additional money for not showing up. The last straw for my dissatisfaction with the airline was the checking in to return back home. I tried to check in online one day before and all seats were already marked as non-available. I assumed I simply need to choose the seat when I check in at the counter. I was one of the first people at the counter 4 hours before the flight. The person who checked me in was a trainee without any experience. She said that there are no seats available anymore next to the window on the two connected flights that I had with the airline. This is simply unbelievable and it's simply a way for them to charge additional money for people being able to choose seats.

### "will fly with Qatar Airways next time"
We flew from Singapore to Manchester via Abu Dhabi, the Singapore to Abu Dhabi leg was great. The next leg to Manchester was very different with a much older plane, rather poor entertainment and food was no where near as good as from Singapore. Then, when flying back from Manchester it all went rather wrong. We had to queue up for well over an hour and a half, when we eventually arrived at the at the check in desk the guy wanted an 150GPB to check in the bike I had brought from Singapore to Manchester without any extra cost. He stated we were only allowed one bag each, there seemed to be time so I wanted to repack my bag slightly and only check my bike bag, he would not allow me to do this an insisted we paid the 150GPB or we would miss our flight. On the next counter to us a couple were having similar issues. We tried our best though there was no other airline staff around and the check in staff are not employed by Etihad so there was nothing they could do really. We paid up and then got to the boarding to find out the flight was delayed an hour, then it was delayed even longer which meant we would miss our connecting flight. It wasn't all bad as we were put up in an excellent hotel with great food and the plus for me was that I was able to now watch the McGregor vs Mayweather fight. The other upside is that we chatted with the other couple who had isses in the next isle to us and they informed us about the regulations. If a passenger flying out of the UK is more than 6 hours delayed they are entitled to 600euro / person. After lots of emails and proof of our flights we eventually got our 600/each from Etihad. I'll pay the extra and fly with Qatar Airways next time for sure. I will add my scores would be much better as the Singapore side is excellent, the Manchester side really let's the whole airline down.

### "their suggestion was to take a train"
My wife and I bought a flight from Perth to Berlin via Abu Dhabi, our problems started when day before I wanted to check in - my flight wasn't here! They canceled my flight form Abu Dhabi to Berlin, instead of this I had Abu Dhabi to Munich connection. I called them, their suggestion was to take a train - are you kidding me?! They didn't have any solution for it so I bought additional flight. It was very expensive flight and I paid for it from my pocket because of Etihad. They've changed my return flight again and again they didn't tell me about this! Plane was dirty inside, my chair was wet and solution from the crew was to put 2 blankets on it to not feel it. I've sent a complain about this, for most of the time they are ignoring me, they didn't even acknowledge that they did something wrong. Make your life easier and avoid them.

### "indifferent staff and dreadful food"
I flew from Melbourne to Berlin with Etihad Airways, as I am gluten intolerant, I had ordered a special meal - on one leg of the flight, this was given to another passenger. Because Etihad code share with Air Berlin, with Air Berlin going into liquidation, our return bookings were cancelled and changed around 4 times. I was supposed to be flying out of Berlin, but they thought it would be easy to just fly out of Dusseldorf or Munich - both 5 hour train trips or maybe to get across to Serbia and fly from there. The final solution offered was to fly from Berlin with Alitalia to Rome, hang around in the airport for 8 hours and then join up to Abu Dhabi and fly back to Melbourne - this equated to a very long journey. On checking in with Alitalia, they decided that my 15kgs of extra luggage would be charged at Euro 344 for the journey. Note that I had tried to put in the excess baggage through the Etihad website, but it does not allow you to do this - so you are zapped at the airport with a large charge that you are then not in a position to find options for. The travel documentation indicates that the cost for an extra bag is US$ 185.00, however this is not the case. I shipped a 30kg suitcase door to door from Germany for Euro 280 so you can see how bad this charge is. On the flight, once again no special meal so the crew had to find bits of fruit for me to eat - they blame this on Flight Centre and Flight Centre say the meal request was definitely in the system - who is lying? Both totally incompetent. A totally dreadful experience and will never fly with them or recommend them again. Beware, the flights look cheap but you get what you pay for, squashed seats, bad service, indifferent staff and dreadful food. Add to that dirty bathrooms, in one, no toilet roll and do yourself a favour and fly another airline.

### "see how late plane will leave"
Cairo to Abu Dhabi. We started by checking luggage in which took about an hour for such small crowd about 40 people ahead of me. Then reported at desk that the guy had a point that we saw a number of people checking luggage from side outside line. Only three desks were open for check in. Then at gate very late boarding I am still waiting at airplane as I am writing and people still boarding so let’s see how late plane will leave. And at gate only two employees checking boarding pass to let people in after computer fail. Boarding started 15-30 min before take off time. I am flying Coach but if I would rate this airline I would give them a 3 so far. I have another flight to Los Angeles which is 17 hours. I will write another review when I get home about the whole experience. But so far I would not recommend this airline.

### "choose a different airline next time"
Jakarta to Berlin via Abu Dhabi and Belgrade, I was looking forward to enjoy a pleasant flight. The first flight from Jakarta to Abu Dhabi was an Etihad operated flight, the last two flights were Air Serbia operated flights. For those, who do not know Air Serbia: Etihad owns 49% of that airline and manages it. The first flight was a night flight, departing 0:10 am. My seat was not reclining as it should. It was going back to normal position, when I leaned forward a little. The flight attendant confirmed that the seat has a defect, and told me, she would try to find a solution. Well, nothing happened, not even a feedback. After 23 hours of travelling with Etihad (including waiting times at the airports), I was about to start my final flight to Berlin at Belgrade on time. While waiting in the airplane I fell asleep, just to wake up 20 min. after regular departure time, because of the pilot's announcement: All passengers would need to leave the airplane due to a technical error. Then, we needed to wait, without knowing, what would happen next. This took around 3 hours. The airline provided water and apple juice for free but no information. Then, the flight was cancelled. The ground staff told us, that we would get new tickets immediately and after that we would stay in a hotel to catch our new flight connection on the next day. What they did not tell us: Everybody would need to wait until all new tickets are issued. No option to buy food is available at that part of the airport. After that, we would be transfered directly to the hotel. This happened another 2 hours later. While waiting for the new tickets to be issued and in the bus for the other passengers whose tickets have not been issued yet, no food was provided. So 5.30 hours after the regular departure time, I was checking in at the hotel. It was 11.40 pm local time and they were about to pick me up at 4 am the next day, so that I could catch my flight in the morning at 6.35 am. At the hotel we were finally provided a food bag, with a sandwich in it, an apple, drinkable yoghurt and chocolate mousse...The hotel kitchen was closed already...too late. The spa was also closed by the way. Well, I did not get any sleep that night, because I was so afraid of missing my next flight, because I was super tired. All in all, the way I was treated as a customer was semi-professional. I would probably choose a different airline next time.

### "professional and kind"
Etihad Airways made our flights the least of our worries on the whole trip (we had very bad luck the entire trip, except on the flights). We visited UAE for 4 days and Cairo, Egypt for 10 days with transit home to Chicago. Our journey back home was 26 hours. The team had a very hospitable and caring attitude and never seemed like we were bothering them at all if we needed anything. My husband was very sick and had sinus pressure pain in his face, one of the girls kept coming to check on us and got us a hot towel, and followed up later on to check on him. They really went above and beyond compared to other airlines we have been with before. I even forgot my phone on the plane when landing in Chicago and the captain and manager took it and saw me running back and returned it to me, then followed up with us a few minutes after about our baggage just to check on us. The most professional and kind international team I ever flew with. Recommended for anyone traveling to or around the Middle East.

### "Etihad has become so cost cutting"
Munich to Abu Dhabi in First class. I flew Eithad to the US twice before from the UAE in first and raved about the food, service and comfort on its 380. So roll on three years forward and a business class booking where I spent good money to upgrade to first from Munich to Abu Dhabi​ where​ the experience could not have been more different and disappointing. The outbound flight EY04 Boeing 777-300 seat was the first shock since clearly these seats had seen a better day and for the most part unless fully extended was uncomfortable. The leather padding kept moving around and thus prone to slide in the sitting position. Unlike the two prior trips where the first class seating was big enough to seat two people these seats were not. The aircraft seemed old and worn unlike the new 777’s which are great to fly. The food options were greatly diminished from prior Etihad flights and I was a bit shocked to see just how uninteresting the menu was. I ordered food but then decided to cancel since sleep was needed. I did not feel like I missed anything and other reviewers confirmed it. I would have liked something to munch on even though the plane had less than an hour before landing but the answer was no. Really not even a breakfast roll? I had to keep asking for coffee refills but at least I got that. Very different from my prior Etihad flights​ where service was outstanding​.​ ​ The movie selection was mediocre and not worth turning on to watch the films available. The other on board surprise was the FC toiletries that were handed out. An oversized bag with tiny samples of lotion or toothpaste. Etihad no longer carries the Bergamonte brand it did ​previously​ and clearly my bag was exactly the same as business. Etihad use to be much more generous in its offering both size and quality of products. Once I passed immigration I decided to stop into the arrivals lounge for a bite to eat since I missed my meal and the food offerings there were a joke. Some tiny sandwiches tea, juice or coffee. So I passed and decided to wait until I reach my hotel. Etihad has also cheapened its car service by insisting you buy a full fare ticket before you have access to the service. At first their worthless customer service said no but I tried requesting again online and got a confirmation of service so I was able to use it. The supervisor in the line of cars awaiting Etihad passengers had to argue with four of the drivers before one would agree to take me as I was not that far from the airport. I was shocked to watch them go back and forth. The value if I had booked a car service they recommended for the discounted FC passengers from AUH to ​the Intercontinental​ $35. Now Etihad has become so cost cutting that on a $5500 ticket they didn’t want to cover the $35 cost or even pay for the $20 taxi ride to my hotel? So average service, mediocre food, worn out first class seating, unnecessary rules for first class car service; just adds up to a second class airline in all major categories when looking at their competition. It was the initial pricing and prior experience which hooked me into grabbing a seat. I just wish I had read the other reviews before booking as I would have taken another choice.

### "food not up to the mark"
Business class was comfortable and the staff is very attentive. However the menu and food is not up to the mark and very restricted. Despite booking meals in advance we didn’t get what we asked for. They also ran out of some dishes after some part of the flight. Lastly, we had a Jet Airways connection flight from Bombay to Abu dhabhi. It’s a terrible seat for business class in an old school carrier. Waste of money - we hope Etihad chooses better partners.

### "I would recommend Etihad"
I travelled on Etihad yesterday from Kochi to Jeddah with one stopover in Abu Dhabi. There is nothing wrong to mention, infact everything was good and smooth. The airport staff being kind and polite and wanted to assist. My check in took roughly five minutes. The flight was good and it had more legroom compared to any other airline I have travelleD. The food was normal, nothing special to mention. From Abu Dhabi to Jeddah I felt a little discomfort as that flight had no push back seats and was fully occupied too. Everything else was good. I would recommend Etihad to my friends and family.

### "worst experience of my life"
New Delhi to Bahrain via Abu Dhabi. This is the worst experience of my life. Flight gets delayed in New Delhi and as a result I have to miss my connecting flight. The staff is so rude in Abu Dhabi. Rather than trying to help or provide solutions they would rather behave irritated. Now they have given me a flight the next day. I am a girl traveling alone, staying in the airport overnight is inappropriate. They should consider these facts but instead they prefer being adamant and non negotiable. Also be careful while booking your flight. They book in the name of Etihad Airlines and send customers in Jet Airways. Even if it is codesharing it needs to be mentioned. We are not fools here. We have paid our money and therefore expect service. Rather than the rude behavior of the staff. The staff is not doing us a favor in fact it is the other way around. I am despising this experience.

### "cabin crew were friendly"
Flew Brisbane to Amsterdam via Abu Dhabi. I recently had 2 flights with Etihad Airways and they were both extremely good. The cabin crew were friendly and could not have been more helpful, the seats and lighting great and the cabin temperature just right. The toilets were clean and checked during the flight. The food was better then I am used to with other airlines. The lounge in Abu Dhabi was well equipped and the washrooms and shower very clean with a special cleaning lady present and helpful. Only critical point is the transit through Abu Dhabi airport, that is more like a survival of the fittest, but the airline cannot be blamed for that.

### "one of my bags was missing"
I travelled by Etihad Airways on 1st September from Lahore to Toronto. I had 2 stopovers, Abu Dhabi and Dublin. When I reached Toronto, one of my bags was missing. Since then despite sending repeated emails,making phone calls, at first Etihad didnt respond. Etihad had code sharing with PIA and Air Canada. When finally they responded, they said it was not their responsibility and put blame on Air Canada. They said they have closed the case from their side. How can they close the case like that? My whole bag of 23 kilos is gone they think it is a joke, not ready to compensate. It is a very devastating and demoralising situation.

### "inflight service was very poor,"
Abu Dhabi to Melbourne. The worst flight ever. No leg space and the inflight service was very poor, the worst I have ever come across. This is the 2nd time I have flown Etihad Airways, thinking it was a one off bad service I got the first time, but the 2nd time round was the same poor service.

### "Awful onboard service"
Kathmandu to Abu Dhabi. Booked seats were gone so I had to sit separate from my wife. Awful onboard service, it took more than 1.30h. before we got something to drink. After the meal the crew dissappeared and didn't came back. Nothing was served anymore. On arrival it took more than 20 mins before we could get out of the plane so we had only 1.15 hour transfer time left. When I got into the bus my wife was forbidden to join me because they said the bus was full which wasn't. It took 20 min before she arrived at the terminal. We were just in time to get our KLM flight to Amsterdam. KLM crew immediately gave us something to drink before take off when I told them about this bad experience. Unbelieveble that Etihad is a 5 Star airline.

### "they have gone downhill"
Paris to Brisbane via Abu Dhabi. I have to share the sentiment of most of the recent reviews about Etihad posted here. I was happy to get an A380 from Paris to Abu Dhabi compared to a. ageing 777-300 I flew recently and then a 787 for the second flight. Both aircraft were nice and new but the service and food were just lacking. What was particularly frustrating was that the entertainment system offers a food and drink section but it was always unavailable and never worked on either flight. Food was average and as others said I wasn’t given a choice for the second meal on the Brisbane leg of the flight. The in-flight service was very disappointing as I rarely saw the flight attendants at all and I had to press the call button just to get a tiny cup of water. I have flown other airlines that have been very attentive but Etihad seem to train their staff to do as little as possible in order to save money on snacks and beverages. The entertainment on offer is also limited compared to other airlines. I’ve been with Qantas and Emirates who have a much wider variety of films and tv shows to watch than Etihad do. What also annoyed me is that on the Paris to Brisbane leg they locked the tinting on the windows so it was really dark on the aircraft despite being daytime. I was looking forward to seeing the beautiful Western Australian coastline from my seat but was prevented from doing this by the flight crew. I was unable to edit the window settings as they had been locked out. There does seem to be an element of cost cutting at play which has resulted in poor service. I feel that Etihad may have once been a good airline but they have gone downhill. Avoid and fly with someone else.

### "More cost cutting?"
Bangkok to Dammam via Abu Dhabi. Below the better business class experience. After 1,5 hours airborne, meal service finally commenced. Annoyingly late when you want to catch up with some sleep too. The soup was tepid and the spoon missing, had to wait another five minutes to get cabin crew's attention. The pasta was dry. No refill of glasses, made it even more dry. Had to ask again and wait another ten minutes before the wine bottle came by. No amenity bag, but ear plugs offered on request! Cost saving measure? Cabin crew seemed to be a bit inexperienced and swamped. Not visible in cabin other when rushing back and forth to seats, which may explain they were on a minimum number. More cost cutting? The Miracle lounge prior to departure was okay, rather a bar with snacks than a fully fledged business lounge. The outbound flight was okay but not any of the "wow" experiences I have had in the past with other airlines. Altogether, not overly impressed. I could recommend compared to KLM or any American airline, but compared to Singapore Airlines and Qatar Airways, no.

### "not considering Etihad for future travel"
Manchester to Brisbane via Abu Dhabi. MAN-AUH in a dated Boeing 777-300. Check in at Manchester slow as many passengers were travelling with "several" bags plus a lot of "carry on" was being physically checked for weight & size. Uncomfortable seat with legroom, IFE and food just average - no idea what was on offer foodwise until given choice by flight attendant - and for 2nd meal there was no choice. Even though in transit at AUH there were still 2 security checks - 1 whilst transferring between arrival and departure areas and another at the actual gate. Abu Dhabi to Brisbane in a relatively recent 787 but again the comments re legroom, seat and food still applicable although screen for IFE on 787 a vast improvement on 777. Will not be considering Etihad for future travel.

### "incompetent boarding crew"
Abu Dhabi to Warsaw via Minsk. Most incompetent boarding crew ever. I had no check-in baggage with me on this flight. During boarding in Abu Dhabi my hand luggage was taken from me by the cabin crew due to lack of space in passengers compartment. When luggage was confiscated in Abu Dhabi I was not provided with any luggage-ticket. I did not know if the bag will land in main trunk or maybe the crew will manage to compact it somewhere in passengers compartments. Only information that I was discarded by the crew was negligible "you will find your bag after landing". After landing I approached again one crew member and asked him about my bag. He instructed me to proceed to the airport "and I will find it on the belt". I was transferring in Minsk to another airline, and there is no belt for transferring baggage. Airport staff was helpless as well. Eventually I received my baggage after two days in my destination airport after frantic private phone investigation at airlines and airports. The issue was created by negligence of Etihad staff consisting either of following: - assuming that there are no transfer passenger and sending all collected bags to final belt, not providing any receipt for collected baggage, taking no action in request to return of find missing baggage. I cannot imagine how "professional" airline as Etihad allow for such simple mistakes of the crew, eventually resulting traumatic experience of passengers. Additionally my seat had not working audio input.

### "Seat is quite comfortable"
Flew Etihad Airways from Abu Dhabi to Melbourne. Seat 41K is on the main deck, 2nd row. Due to the tapering of the plane the space on the window side is narrow. Due to the stairs to upper deck there are no middle seats, giving this row a bit more privacy and quietness. Seat is quite comfortable, although a bit narrow and could do with an extra inch of leg space. Entertainment system has a big screen with good resolution. In seat power available. Food is very average and supply is limited (just 2 meals for a 13 hours flight).

### "problems seem to have hit very hard"
Bangkok to Abu Dhabi. Flew Emirates in September, and this return on Etihad was simply awful. Their financial problems seem to have hit very hard and resulted in a poor flight. Staff seem very demoralised and unhappy and not afraid to show this in their lack of service. Service was more than on-demand - it was close to non-existent if you did not demand it several times and never seen such a lazy bunch of cabin staff. Food was in miniscule portions and not very good, and don't think about asking for pajamas, they told us that all the nice items had been cut by management after their problems. I will avoid Etihad in future.

### "First class seat is such a big disappointment"
Etihad have this system that you can bid on a flight upgrade and I decided to give this a go and got upgraded to First Class on my Melbourne to Abu Dhabi flight. Cabin had only 8 seats and you had good privacy. The staff were very professional in catering to your needs. Food was very well prepared and tasted good, you could eat whenever you needed which is a given in this class of cabin. The First class seat is such a big disappointment as its only on a par with Qatar's business class seat. No mattress was offered, no proper pillow either and these seats have aged a lot, it was very uncomfortable lying down I hardly got any sleep. Again TV on demand was only average compared to Qatar and Emirates and we are talking first class here. I don't think its worth the upgrade from the business class offering but at least you are given the chance to bid which is fun.

### "Horrible economy class"
Sydney to Manchester via Abu Dhabi. Horrible economy class experience onboard Etihad Airways. The service was very bad, the cabin crew did not show the service standard that they should have, no menu provided. After the meal service, there are no water services. The configuration of 777W is horrible, the economy class seat was old and uncomfortable. The meals tasted alright but there is not enough food for the flight from Sydney to Abu Dhabi as the flight is around 14 hours. There is no choice for the second meal service.

### "worst experience ever"
Ho Chi Minh City to New York via Abu Dhabi. Stay, stay away from Etihad at all costs. I had one single trip booked from SGN to JFK, with worst experience ever in my almost 30 years of flying. I've read good stories and recommendations on Etihad, and conveniently there was a good flight from SGN to JFK with one stop at (Abu Dhabi) a very convenient time at 8:00pm, arriving around 10am at JFK. Flight got cancelled and booked for another flight 9 hours later: aircraft issue - understandable. I was offered hotel and rides back and forth upon my arrival at the airport - still understandable. I did not take this offer because I wanted to spend more time with my family. Due to this flight delay, my whole itinerary changed: SGN-AUH-IAD-JFK. There was another flight straight from AUH-JFK but regretfully missed by few min, but they weren't going to let me on that plane anyway - I paid for a one stop flight. I was boarding for flight from AUH and heard an Etihad staff yelling at a passenger in a line to move away? The passenger looked so dumbfounded. Extremely unprofessional behavior. Arrived and found out flight was cancelled from IAD to JFK. They did not offer me hotel (did offer a discounted rate), nor another method of ride to JFK that night. Had a meeting at work the next morning, how inconveniently arrived just a night before the meeting due to delays and cancellations. Therefore, I decided to take a train, but I had to wait for my luggage at an office, and the lady there, who was associated with JetBlue, got me on a free shuttle from IAD to JFK (Which I truly appreciated). Overall, my flight was extended by 12 hours, arrived 15+ hours later than expected, extra costs I spent at the airport. After this incidence, I requested for a refund of my ticket or at least get compensated for the cancelled flight that I never took and for the major changes (one stop flight -> two stops). They did offer me some compensation after 2 months, and I received 15,000 miles on Etihad. I can't even go anywhere with 15,000 miles. I argued that I deserve more, but they reviewed and concluded that was enough for me, they said. I received the miles just because I might be able to transfer these miles to another airlines that I take, if not, it's just going to rot there. I will never be taking Etihad again, and will strongly recommend against it. Just thinking about my experience with Etihad makes me so angry..

### "you could feel the cost-cutting"
Ho Chi Minh to Frankfurt return via Abu Dhabi. Etihad Airways losing its stars and reputation. After a disappointing outbound experience I hoped for the better this time. But check-in in Frankfurt was very bad, again: Staff seemed to be demotivated, overworked and arrogant. Our request to add an extra bag within our maximum weight allowance was rejected and ground staff even started to argue with us that the information on this matter given to us by Etihad before in writing was wrong and that we were lying to them. The Etihad-lounge in Frankfurt, before one of the best lounges in the world, was shut down. Instead we have been offered Lufthansa Senator-lounge, which is a business-class lounge only. So no first class lounge access even for a fully paid first class flight and instead of a steak grilled to order or other individually cooked items only turkey sausages were our hot dinner-option in Frankfurt, since we wanted to sleep on the short night flight to Abu Dhabi. The next bad surprise was that Etihad – in order to cut costs – does not even cater on board any local newspaper or magazine from its departure-countries any more. Only English and Arabic language papers from Abu Dhabi were available – which were outdated. Staff on board was friendly and professional, and we had a good sleep on board. Upon arrival in Abu Dhabi, priority delivery-service was not working and we had to wait for about 45 minutes for our luggage. Etihad also cancelled it’s free chauffeur service. The counter after arrival was closed and we have been sent by a cheap 8-seater-taxi to our hotel rather than a limousine. Check-in at Etihad’s 1st Class counter in Abu Dhabi was again a disaster: bossy staff that neither greeted us nor helped re-packing our baggage because one piece they said was overweight, even though we checked in the same piece with Etihad in FRA 2 days before with no problem. My request for helping us with some Scotch-tape to re-seal the 2 boxes we had to open for re-packing was ignored, the check-in lady did not even leave her chair to look for it, and instead we were requested to seal them for a hefty fee by an outside supplier. Because of the request of re-packing without proper packing materials some valuable crystal items arrived broken. Communication was very unfriendly, too: instead of asking my wife for her passport, the check-in agent was just waving my passport at us and asked us: ‘who flies’? The agent also checked not our seat-requests and we first did not get our assigned seats. Our flight was leaving from T1, yet no information at check-in that Etihad only has one first class lounge in T3 - where we checked in. So we walked more than 15 minutes through the hectic Abu Dhabi airport from T3 to T1 and back to T3. At least the service on board was spotless, even though you could feel the cost-cutting when it came to the food and beverage-selections. Upon arrival, we were greeted by the airport manager, who helped us through passport control. In conclusion, savings in catering and staff, resulting in overworked and arrogant check-in agents, stop of chauffeur-services and denied access to a 1st class lounge are making even 1st-class flying with Etihad a pain. The only good thing is that the staff on board still remains friendly and professional, as before. Other than that Etihad does not live up to its 5 star rating.

### "pathetic with callous staff"
Manchester to Sydney via Abu Dhabi. Extremely appalling service by the callous staff at Manchester. I am a frequent flyer and travelled all the continents. This time I was carrying my usual hand luggage and they did not allow me to carry it as its small wheels were not fitting in the frame. Whilst I stated that I have been using this in many flights none had any objection they did not budge. We are different was their response. Then to add insult to injury asked me to pay £160.0 as it was the airline fee for additional bag. As my first check in bag hardly had 16kg, I was told to transfer stuff in it and throw the hand bag away. When I tried to transfer stuff in checked in hand bad it became 24.0kg and they would not even allow for that. I have been trying to contact their UK office and spoke to them three times regarding my luggage issue. They make notes but when you ask them to refer to those they come back saying we do not trust these notes we will listen to the recorded communication and get back to you. They never come back. This airline is pathetic with callous staff. This is my last booking with them.

### "below normal business class"
Paris to Sydney via Abu Dhabi. So disappointing after expecting a good standards airline. The lounge in CDG was nice looking, but food choice very bad. Seat was okay, but Boeing 777 was dirty cabin and seats smelled, portion of the food served worse than economic class, and the experience was very discount. Staff were nice when I saw them but they have to be called for and they are not in the cabin like most airlines. Abu Dhabi airport stopover was a busy time and the lounge space very bad, we could not find 2 seats together. I read 2 weeks previously this airline was in a bad position and think that the flight standards would not change, but everything about this trip was below normal business class levels.

### "disappointed with the cabin service"
Perth to Paris via Abu Dhabi. Having made the decision to go business class, we were very disappointed with the cabin service in particular. After taking our order, it took at least an hour for the meal. One meal was 3 hours (had to be rerequested) and one was 2. One coffee never arrived. The staff after finishing meal service, disappeared and there was no way to call for service apart from finding them. Neither could we find a service bell. Wifi didn't work on any leg, and we couldn't charge iPads. The seats on the plane from Perth were uncomfortable, but did fold down to a flat bed. Same movies on all 4 legs, over a month apart.

### "cost-cutting its No. 1 priority"
Ho Chi Minh City to Frankfurt via Abu Dhabi.I am a Platinum member of this airline and always was surprised by its excellent equipment and 5-star-service. Not anymore. Since Etihad is in financial turmoil and cost-cutting became its No. 1 priority, lounges are closed, service turned sour and savings on dining and wining even in Etihad’s First Class are the new, disappointing standard. Because of staff-reductions, we had to wait 15 minutes at check-in at SGN-airport. Reason: staff was checking in Business-Class guests at Etihad’s First-Class counter. Formerly an absolute no-no. Boarding was chaotic, as well: no priority boarding and we had to queue with all other 200+ passengers. The welcome on board was warm, yet the standard of service is dropping down: instead the traditional collection of 3 different snacks only nuts were served and even though it was only 3 passengers in First, my wife and me could not get the requested mixed vegetables, because they ‘run out of it’ already. The amenity-kit, formerly a traditionally designed and waved pouch of high quality was replaced by a cheap plastic version and mine was used already (pouch with lip-balm, etc. missing). The interior of the aircraft, an old A340 was outworn and some of the buttons for the remote of the Personal Entertainment system and the seat were not working properly any more. Staff, however, was friendly and caring. On the stopover I also visited the Etihad 1st Class lounge in Abu Dhabi, which is excellent. But waiting times in the restaurant increased significantly and waiting more than 2 hours for a morning-shave is unacceptable. Our continuing flight to Frankfurt was on a remote gate. Yet, 35 minutes before boarding no bus for 1st and business-class passengers was available. Had to wait with all other passengers for more than 20 minutes. No seat available, thus standing. Entering the aircraft by stairs was hectic, people were squeezing each other, so we decided to board last. Pre-flight service was hectic because the bus arrived just 5 minutes before departure but at least the inflight-service was flawless. Upon arrival no arrival service and our luggage was delivered late, even though we had priority and first-class stickers on them. I always have been a fan of Etihad and enjoyed its perfect lounges, services and friendly staff. But cost-cutting effects even Etihad’s most loyal (Platinum-member) and revenue-contributing (flying 1st-class) customers to such a degree, that the great flight-experience, I am paying for, hardly exists any more. No first-class lounge-access except Abu Dhabi, long waiting lines, worn out cabin interior, bad catering, no luggage-priority, no free chauffeur-service (except Abu Dhabi, were taxis are offered instead). All in all a very disappointing experience.

### "Cutting back things in premium cabin"
London to Phuket via Abu Dhabi. As I approached the check in area the check in staff were having a conversation. I waited for them to finish there said conversation before I handed my passport. After a few security questions I was checked in and directed to the fast check security , I did so and was greeted by the most welcoming man with a warm smile (a Heathrow staff member) who checked my boarding pass and wished me a safe flight. After browsing the duty free shops I made my way to gate 10 where the Etihad Airways lounge is located. On entertaining the lounge I met two lovely welcome hosts who asked if my luggage and suit bag would like to be stored. She then offered me the WIFI slip. The first impression of the lounge was dark and small. I passed about 6 staff who were standing there like zombies no more then a smile. I had a walk around before I sat in the ala carte section where I thought I would have a nice lunch. There were pre set menus on the table so I had a look and went for the salmon salad of which I ordered after attracting the attention of one of the staff. I asked for a glass of Chardonnay and some sparkling water and was told I had to help my self from the buffet area. I found that very strange considering I was sat in the restaurant area expecting restaurant service? The salad arrived in super quick time (with no salad only x2 baby potatoes cut into 4 pieces, green beans, 2 cherry tomatoes also cut into 4 pieces and a splash of balsamic dressing) -  the salmon was very moist clearly being sat in a steamer until an order came in. After my salad-less salad I fancied a coffee so decided I leave the lounge and head to Costa Coffee as the Etihad coffee machine had seen better days. Boarding was called and like you'd expect everyone marched up to the gate in one go only to be turned away as there zones were not yet called. A warm welcome from the crew as I boarded and found my seat 16A. Business seats are incredible and should be rolled out on all Etihads long haul business class. The flight was fantastic, service standards won back from that I had in the lounge. Only downside they have taken the wash bags away and only offer these on night flights! Explained by the crew member with a nervous smile. Items like toothbrush, socks were available but you had to ask. Cutting back things in the premium cabins never goes down well with crew or the paying passengers who expect it. My connection in Abu Dhabi was very long so enjoyed a bit of quiet time and sleep in the lounge. when I finally boarded my flight to Phuket I slept most of the way. Overall opinion on my experience was a fantastic airline but need touching up on the outstations service style to be more consistent.

### "cutbacks they have made"
Sydney to London via Abu Dhabi. Flew out of Sydney in business class on a Boeing 777, my first time on Etihad Airways since 2014, and what a major disappointment. The airline is clearly suffering big time after all the losses I read about, but what is worse are the cutbacks they have made. No proper amenities, pyjamas etc available, and food was really no different to economy class standards on Thai Airways that I flew via Bangkok in April this year (except on Thai it was served hot, and cooled down to almost cold on Etihad). I spoke (complained I guess!) with two very nice staff about the cuts and they expected much more to come and seemed very downbeat about their jobs. After suffering the appalling zoo of Abu Dhabi airport my connecting flight to London was an A380. While the plane was nicer, it was a repeat showing of a sub-standard business class. I nearly booked business with Qatar Airways but chose Etihad as they were AUS$200 cheaper - a bad decision!

### "will not recommend this airline"
Los Angeles to Tehran via Abu Dhabi. My daughter and myself had a return flight (Economy class) from LAX to IKA. The flight was scheduled for 4:55pm. We arrived at the airport around 2:15pm and waited in the line for the checking-in process. After around 50 minutes, it was our turn. When the lady with light brown and skirt weighed our 4 luggage pieces, each had between 2-3Kg overweight which was a bit higher than what we had found in home weighing them. In fact, by seeing the overweight of the first one, she did not want to weigh the rest of them which we insisted to see if the total was lower than the maximum allowed weight when she finally agreed. When she saw the overweight, she asked us either to pay the overweight fee or reduce the weight somewhere else and then go to the end of the line and said that it was the policy. This was unfair to us which had waited in the line for about 50 minutes which was long and also the check-in line had not been shorten by then anyways. Also, nobody had told us about the policy and asked us to check the weights before it becomes our turn for check-in. We reduce the weight to below 46 Kg for each of us. Then, I complained to the lady who said that she was the supervisor and finally, as an exception of the policy, she directed us to a different line than the normal one which took us the same time as that of the original line. The check-in finished around 4:00pm (close to two hours for the check-in process) and we had to go to the passport control and security check with the 55 minutes left for us. This took longer than usual. Finally, we got to the gate five minutes to departure gate when luckily there was about 30 minutes delay of departure time which we did not know. Now, that you very strict on the maximum allowed weight, you should let your passengers know ahead of time about this and ask/direct them to weight their luggage pieces in the airport with scales that are in the counter before staying in the queue. I guess that that is the minimum that I could expect. The airline might consider us as just two passengers not caring about this insulting experience but this was my first and probably the last flight with Etihad Airways and I will not recommend this airline.

### "Ground Staff are terrible"
Dhaka to Milan via Abu Dhabi (returning from Rome) in business class. Ground Staff are terrible. Either they can't communicate or don't know how to behave with customers. From Abu Dhabi, they didn't pick my luggage to my connecting flight to Milan. Staff of Security (where you need to check all belongings) are terrible. I approached for priority check for business class. But without asking me the staff roughly indicated to get in the mass. Power point for charge didn't work! The cabin crew told that it will work after flying and he flew away from me. The entertainment and movie collection is so limited. Can't complain about the food. Now waiting to catch the last connecting flight. Wish me luck.

### "I would avoid it in future"
Flew with my wife and two kids, including an infant, from London to Kochi via Abu Dhabi. I was initially told when I booked my tickets that bassinets were given on a first-come-first-served basis and I couldn't book them in advance. This was wrong. When I phoned a few days before the flight the customer agent said I should have requested the bassinets with my booking and that my child would have no bassinet on the Abu Dhabi-Kochi flight. Rather shocked to hear this I asked her to confirm the bassinet arrangements for my infant. She was rude and petulant - unbecoming of a good customer service agent. The service on board was nothing to write home about. We had an A380 on the London to Abu Dhabi sector and an A320 for Abu Dhabi to Kochi. The stewardesses hardly cared or bothered how we were coping with our little baby. It seemed just giving us a bassinet was the most they could do. One Arabic boy who cried a lot got a lot of attention. I felt there was preferential treatment toward people based on their appearance and ethnicity. Most of the cabin crew seemed to be Eastern Europeans or Arabic. The meals were disappointing: portions were small and not very tasty. The only good points were the aircraft, which were in good condition, and the inflight entertainment systems. I thought overall the airline was lacking in basic customer service skills and I would avoid it in future.

### "customer service is horrific"
First time to fly with this Airline, and I swear it will also my last. My inbound flight to LAX from AUH had no issue. But my outbound flight from LAX to RUH via AUH, I think Etihad management should be aware that their LAX ground crew behaves like they are having picnic in the park (noisy chatting and laughing while checking in passengers) and the in-flight meals from LAX-AUH (in our seats/rows) we were served vegetarian meals not only once but twice, the stewardess reasoned out no other options as they ran out of meat or fish but hey, it happened 2x during the 16.5 hours flight? And the worst of all - the check in process from Abu Dhabi to Riyadh, it's highly disorganized, first time I've seen such check-in chaos in my more than 20 years of air travels. What happened with Etihad's ground staff? I should thank though, it was a safe travels, but customer service is horrific!

### "cutting costs everywhere"
Mumbai to New York via Abu Dhabi. Ground service in Mumbai disorganised, but worse followed in the zoo called Abu Dhabi airport. The staff there are rude, dismissive to most foreigners and particularly to Indians. Service on the shorter flight was alright, but to New York on the A380 was one of my worst flights ever. The food standards are terrible and such small portions. (My seat neighbour that flies them more often said the airline is cutting costs everywhere due to their problems.) Staff came to serve meals but were quick to hide in kitchens after that. The overhead bells were ringing fairly constantly and staff do not attend to most of them. I've got the return to face in 2 weeks and not looking forward to it. Last time I flew Qatar Airways who are so much better, but unfortunately I cannot change my return booking on Etihad.

### "read that Etihad is in trouble"
London to Abu Dhabi in business class, EY20. Seats on A380 are okay although rather narrow when you try to sleep and feel very restricted. That's about it, as the service was awful. Staff seemed reluctant to offer any service, food had to almost be demanded and once served they leave you alone to the point of forgetting you. What they did serve seems to confirm everything I had read that Etihad is in trouble! Small meal portions, poorly heated and well below biz class standards. Part of my trip out to Singapore GP this was a cheap late ticket, and I am so relieved we are booked with a group to fly back on Qatar Airways, who seem to be one of few airlines to maintain their quality standards. Abu Dhabi as a transit point is sheer hell and to be avoided if you can help it.

### "Seats very uncomfortable"
New York to Lahore via Abu Dhabi. Seats very uncomfortable. Very hard seat cushion and very less legroom for such along flight. Abu Dhabi Airport is the worst in in its class. Line to the bathrooms was stretched out all the way to the middle of the lobby, at least an hour wait and the bathrooms were smelly and flooded. Personally I think it was one of the most traveller unfriendly airport. This airport has broken escalators and have hardly any flight displays to find out your flight info. Will never travel Etihad Airways again.

### "airline has been cutting corners"
Dublin to Abu Dhabi. I have flown this airline a number of times in the past, but I will do everything in my power to avoid doing do in future. This airline has been cutting corners for a while now, despite the contention that it is a five star airline. This is a long distance budget airline. It cuts costs by, for example, in Dublin, sharing the budget terminal with Ryanair. Recently, like other budget airlines, it has been enforcing carry on baggage rules - 7kg for a carry on bag, 5kg for a second bag. They will force you to juggle weight around your various hold/ carry-on luggage until you meet the required standards. They quote "safety restrictions' despite the fact that even other 'budget' airlines allow a carry-on limit of 10kg. They won't listen to reason if you point out that the plane will carry all the combined weight of one's luggage in any case. They will insist that you go to the end of the queue to carry out this farce. And finally, if you have anything fragile, they won't, of course, allow you to carry it in the cabin, but will force you to put it in the hold. They broke my guitar in this way. They even forced me to sign a waiver, stating that I was not entitled to any compensation if it should get damaged on route. When I refused to sign the waiver, they said they wouldn't take it. The result, of course, was a cracked and unplayable guitar. Thanks Etihad, thanks for breaking my guitar! If this isn't enough, the old terminal in Abu Dhabi is an outdated, confused mess, with constant queues for malodorous, inadequate toilets, and smoking rooms that resemble old telephone boxes. I will do everything in my power to use their competitors for that route, Qatar Airways, Emirates or Turkish Airlines and urge others to do the same.

### "experience was impressive"
Dar Es salaam to Seoul via Abu Dhabi. The experience was impressive, the cabin crew are doing a wonderful job, clean aircraft and toilets, the smiles and service wowed me. The thing that they should improve on is the food - not good at all, the presentation the plating is awful - honestly how do you plate "breakfast" on a foil paper (and that breakfast is a piece of pie). They need to check what other airlines are doing.

### "cost cutting severely in place"
Bahrain to Bangkok return via Abu Dhabi in Business. I have been gold with them for some time and always sang their praises. Overall all flights on time and in some cases early. The crews a mix of engaged to those who looked panicky/disorganized to didn't want to be there. Lounge in Abu Dhabi fine, but the airport is creeking at the seems, all flights were by buses with the exception of BKK. Lounge in Bangkok small but fine. It is now evident cost cutting is now severely in place, no more Limos, no more wash bags, cheaper wines and the food onboard is Economy. It was a joke, outbound to BKK was a two egg omelette, with a tomato/ bread and tea. I kid you not, they have reduced the snacks to three offerings being chicken and crisps. The return was soup or mezze, mains were insulting with Biryani (rice), chicken breast with mash or Veg pasta. I must say the outbound crew were super and professional but the return looked like they all hated each other and the atmosphere was evident. Standards are slipping badly but to top it off the attitude of the ground staff has never been good in Abu Dhabi, they all need intense training on customer service and get them engaged or else fire them as they have a rude, lazy, arrogant attitude. One particular was the man boarding the outbound flight to BKK, he snatched my passport, didn't even look at me, was too busy laughing with his colleague and then with out looking at me still, thrust the passport back in my face still laughing with his colleague. That is not acceptable. I was loyal but after this trip not that interested. I'll stick to Emirates or Qatar Airways.

### "had a really poor experience"
Brisbane to Manchester via Abu Dhabi. I've had a really poor experience with Etihad, I've had to get 4 flights with them over the past week - each flight has been delayed by at least half an hour. My flight from Abu Dhabi to Manchester was delayed by 3 hours and the plane was still being loaded with baggage at the new departure time. I'm still watching the plane being loaded as I do this review but I'm expecting to board at least an hour after this new departure time, I won't be suprised if it's 2. The inflight experience has been average at best. If you're thinking about using Etihad I would suggest that you expect to board at least 20 minutes after take off and don't make plans in the next 24 hours after you arrive, you're bound to be disappointed and it's much easier to manage your expectations this way

### "Another bad experience"
Marseille to Abu Dhabi via Paris. Another bad experience with Etihad which is definitely not on the right track. We flew MRS to AUH via Paris CDG, arriving in AUH at 7.30pm, and in spite of a 2 hours transfer lag our 5 pieces of luggage did not make it to Abu Dhabi, like the luggage of another 20 people, even if our luggage were appearing as loaded in Etihad system. After being asked to wait for an hour or so, as they were confident they would locate the luggage in AUH Airport, we were finally asked to file a report as the luggage were definitely somewhere in Paris CDG Airport. Finally left the airport after 2 hours and a half of confusion and chaos as the baggage claim department is undersized, especially since this was a very busy week end. We had high hopes that our luggage would arrive on the next morning as an Etihad flight arrives daily as well at 6.40am from Paris, but unfortunately we saw in the baggage tracking website that they were planned to arrive only on the 7.30pm flight. So 24 hours after our original flight we rang Etihad who informed us that someone would get in touch this same evening to arrange the delivery of our 5 bags. The next morning, as we had not heard anything from Etihad, I rang the luggage service a dozen of times, before getting an answer, to learn that they finally only had 4 of our 5 bags, in spite of what was told us the night before. After insisting, and shouting a bit, they finally went to look for the 5th bag and rang me back to tell me it was finally found and that we could come and pick our 5 bags. Delivery was not possible due apparently to some new requirements of customs who want people there in case a bag needs to be opened. At 6pm, so nearly 48 hours after our original flight, we reached at the airport to collect our bags and there they tell us they have only 4 bags out of the 5. And the cherry on the cake, is that the missing bag is not the same as the one that was thought missing in the morning! So they had found all 5 and lost one again. After another bit of shouting and a couple of hours, we were promised by the supervisor that they would find the bag and bring it home the same night. Drove back home with the 4 bags, and at 9pm received a call from a guy on his way to deliver the 5th bag, which finally reached us at 10pm. Apparently the "you need to come and pick up because of customs” rule had mysteriously disappeared. I could sincerely not believe to have this type of service and complete lack of professionalism from a so called 5 Star Airline. No information if we had not called (on line tracker has still not been updated 2 days after), understaffed baggage department that never picks up the phone, complete disorganization, poor management and complete lack of customer service. If you add to this the very poor service onboard and the low quality of catering, this leads to a clear decision : never again Etihad.

### "Worst airline ever"
Riyadh  to New York via Abu Dhabi and it was a really bad experience. A 13.5 hours flight with 2 meals only. The first meal was an indian breakfast served after 4 hrs in air with no other options and I don't eat spicy food saying that the second meal will be a 3 options meal. After 11 hours comes the second meal where I was expecting a decent one but Etihad Airways continued to surprise me with a vegetarian meal saying that this is only what is left, which i didnt accept. One of the senior cabin crew members came for appologies and offered me a crew meal saying that Etihad Airways will contact me about this issue but that never happened. My return flight September 4th, I checked in online and chose my seat which was 45D. When i dropped my baggages at the check in counter and i was boarding, i found out that my seat was changed to 67D on the boarding pass. I asked the guy at the gate and he says that seat 45D is a paid seat and he had to move me to 67D. How did you let me check in and choose a paid seat without telling me that or asking for an extra fee? And how do you change my seat without at least notifying me or asking me where i would like to sit? What if i wanted to pay for that seat even though the plane that day was half empty. Shame on Etihad Airways to have such a bad service that i have never seen before even in small airlines companies. Well you really disappointed me and im never booking again thats for sure.

### "Totally disappointed"
Manchester to Hong Kong via Abu Dhabi. Totally disappointed. When booking made it stated its widebody seats and I was shocked when boarded the plane. Definitely my worse travel experience in my life. Seats are crowded, bad reclining, not enough entertainment. had to suffer without EBOX service in one trip (not only me but also others). Food was poor, do not have sweetner for coffee. I didn't see much of service by air stewards.

### "treat me as if I was flying free"
Sydney to Delhi via Abu Dhabi in business class. Fantastic food and thats it - nothing more I can comment on expect for the Lounge in Abu Dhabi. Cabin Service was very average; at most times the crew made me feel I should not ask for anything and only eat or drink whats offered. I paid for business and they treat me as if I was flying free. I was asked to get my breakfast right away or the food service was closing, but the crews favourite passenger gets what they want 30 minutes after I finish my breakfast. I wasn't offered coffee or a beverage of my choice.

### "would definitely recommend"
Really nice ground staff got upgraded from Business class to First class from Abu Dhabi to Washington Dulles. First class is definitely the right place to be when traveling long distance. The "first class suite" makes your travel exceptional. It is really spacious and the closing door offers you privacy. Positive points: Large choice of food and drinks. Comfortable seat which transforms into a full flat bed. The crew sets up your bed by adding additional mattress, pillows, blanket. Nice and friendly onboard staff. Would definitely recommend flying First class with this airline.

### "the crew were indifferent"
Flew Chennai to New York via Abu Dhabi. From the time we were seated the crew were indifferent. They served us food which was vegetarian with no options, and the quality of the food was poor. If asked anything the crew just ignored the request. We left Abu Dhabi at 10.00 am, we were served the first above meal after an hour. After which there was no service for over 6 hours. At which point they served cold frozen cheese sandwich. People were fast asleep but the crew members just dumped the sandwhich. When people asked for snacks or something to eat the crew said that there was nothing other than the cold hard sandwich. We were once again served the same or similar food just an hour before landing which was such an hurried service. After this flight I will stick to Emirates.

### "disappointed with the service "
London to Brisbane via Abu Dhabi. I was disappointed with the level of service received on my recent flights. In general the staff came across as moody and dis-interested in anything relating to the passengers. Meal time service was shambolic (it started and stopped numerous times) with staff not taking the time to explain the menu options clearly. Out of four flights; one delivered the service I'd expect from a 5* rated airline, with an additional member of staff delivering fantastic service on another. The rest couldn't have cared less.

### "Service on a decline"
Cochin to London via Abu Dhabi. Service on a decline. One the first leg to Abu Dhabi we were served by an uncaring lady. She was robotic, no smile, no courtesy, nothing. The choice of meal had ran out on a flight that was not even full. On the second leg of the journey, the meal served was awful. Rice and lamb served was inedible as it was very salty, the salad tasted stale. Traveling with a child I thought Etihad might provide a toy / colouring book to keeping them engaged for sometime, nothing was provided. Booking for a family of 6, I had choices when I booked with Etihad. My past experience was good which swayed my decision, even though at the time of booking the competitors had slightly lower rates. From now on Etihad will be my last choice.

### "I am disappointed and disgusted"
Johannesburg to London Heathrow via Abu Dhabi. It has now been over a week since I arrived on a delayed flight, which featured a chaotic boarding process and management. My luggage has also disappeared and we are still not closer to getting this back. We have been informed it is at London Heathrow, but cannot contact anyone there to confirm this. Etihad has left this to the passenger to chase up - and after more than 50 calls and several messages left, there is still no active response in place to assist me. I am a 68 year old lady with medical conditions. Some of my medication is in this suitcase. Quite frankly, the service on this occasion has been dismal. I note from a recent review that this was also experienced the same issue on a completely different flight with little resolution shown from the airline. I am disappointed and disgusted. Hopefully I am able to follow this review with an update, but so far we are not convinced that they are able to do what is necessary.

### "A380 has plenty of room"
Sydney to Abu Dhabi. Check in, lounge in Sydney, onboard service and cabin were excellent. Seats on the A380 has plenty of room, privacy and storage. Meals excellent. Wifi available onboard but cost $$. The arrival business class lounge in Abu Dhabi airport was a nice addition.

### "a carrier on the decline"
Abu Dhabi to Düsseldorf. Fast, but unfriendly checkin at Abu Dhabi Airport. Very crowded airport and chaotic boarding. Seat hard and very tight for a tall person like me. Service robotic with no smile. A tiny breakfast was served on this 7hr flight. I really felt like being on a budget carrier. Flight arrived on time. IFE is not as good as Qatar Airways or Emirates. Overall a rather unpleasant flight on a carrier on the decline. Unfortunately the only airlines flying direct between Germany and AUH.

### "lack of customer centricity"
Mumbai to Chicago via Abu Dhabi. My bag was delayed, arriving Chicago the day after I arrived. That happens occasionally, and in itself would have been acceptable. What is not acceptable is that Etihad took many escalations over 8 days after arrival to trace and deliver the bag. Further, Etihad is trying to avoid issuing the nominal reimbursement I sought under the guise of legalese. This is absolutely unprofessional behaviour all around. Once the bag arrived in Chicago airport, it seems to have vanished into a black hole. The status file disappeared from the baggage tracing link on Day 2. On Day 3 and 4, Phones to the number at Airport were not picked up. Emails sent to airport got no answer. Tweets to etihad got no response. It took three calls to Customer Service (over next 4 days) before I reached a manager who could reach airport manager who initiated delivery. Its been nearly 5 weeks after the travel date, but Etihad is unwilling to initiate a reimbursement. My mistake that I was trying to be nice in making the claim. On tweeting about the reimbursement, Etihad said their records showed baggage delay of only one day. This, when I have mail from Etihad baggage team more than a week after my arrival, trying to plan delivery. Amazing lack of customer centricity. From an airline which gets rated as one of the best!

### "Very rude staff"
Dallas Ft Worth to Hyderabad via Abu Dhabi. Very rude staff at check in counters, was threatened that I will be put on 'no fly list' just because our carry-on bag is an inch longer than the specified measurements. My finger was cut in the process of trying to fit it in the bin and was forced to apologize to the staff at the boarding gate or I will not be allowed to board after I checked in and passed thru security checks.

### "experience has been just average"
Lahore to New York via Abu Dhabi with my husband, 10 year old son and 2.5 year old daughter on 20th June 2017. We returned to Abu Dhabi on 9th August. We are booked to fly to Lahore on 13th August 2017. This was a family holiday and we were all very excited. We had heard great things about Eitehad and had very high expectations. Unfortunately our experience with Etihad has been just average. The only incredibly positive point was the immigration at Abu Dhabi Airport which saves the hassle of long waits at JFK after a long flight. The flights on the 20th of June had a staff which was curt and not at all interested in going the extra mile. The staff on the 8th August flight was much warmer. But we had another disappointing experience when an elderly lady who was traveling alone, felt unwell and was weeping with extreme cold and discomfort we reported it to a female stewardess. She gave her hot tea and told her, rather firmly not to weep. My husband asked a fellow lady passenger to put on some socks on her and comforted her. The lady stewardess never returned to check on her even once. This was when 6 hours of the flight were still left. This is not the kind of care and attention one expects from any airline, especially the one which claims to be the best. The food quality and taste was below average on all the flights. The flight to Abu Dhabi on 8th August served a meal which was vegetarian only, had no other option, and the taste was disappointing. They had nothing for the kids other than the kiddie meal, which was the same Pasta both times. There were no extra Chocolates, crisps or cookies available. Kids do tend to get hungry on a 14 hour flight.

### "nothing dreamy about this Dreamliner"
Flew Cochin to Zurich via Abu Dhabi. Hugely disappointing. Had in my head that Etihad would be as good as the other UAE airline. I was wrong. Etihad has a confusing business strategy. They purport to be a premium airline (which perhaps they are in the premium cabins but the best airlines get it right across all products. These were my first flights with Etihad, there was nothing really bad about the flights but there was just nothing really right about them either. Seats on both flights were tight, not very comfortable. Food on the first flight was ok but the food on the second flight was awful. Drinks selection very average. Abu Dhabi airport is at best underwhelming, chaos, perhaps the new terminal will improve things. I don't drink booze flying but had I wanted to I didn't see any on offer. Service was lacklustre on the 787. The 787 as with everyone that uses this aircraft should have been a chance to really improve customer experience, with Etihad there was nothing dreamy about this dreamliner. I got the flight with miles so at least it didn't cost anything to find out that its not an airline I would choose to fly with again. Very average all round. Oh one good thing the ground staff in Cochin were very helpful.

### "experience was a bit disappointing"
It was our first flight on an Etihad A380 flying from Marseilles to Abu Dhabi via Paris, and I must admit the experience was a bit disappointing comparing to the experience I had with some other airlines that also fly the A380. The legroom was far less than on the B777 we had on the outbound flight, and I also felt the seats to be narrower. Food was very average, with only two meat options offered and not even a piece of cheese. Service was also minimalist, as no one bothered to offer us any drinks outside of meals, on a 7 hours flight. You had to go to the galley, where attendants were chatting to get some water. Not impressed at all to be honest. The only positive was the entertainment system.

### "no longer as it used to be"
Abu Dhabi to Shanghai. I have been flying Etihad Airways for the past year from September 2016. The first time, I loved the service, the food, the wifi service on the plane and service by the cabin crew. Today, I am missing most of the thing I loved from Etihad because the food is terrible, wifi is not accessible anymore (at the beginning I used to pay about 30$ for unlimited traffic for 24 hours, now is 20$ for 180mb) and the service is no longer as it used to be. Therefore, I can say that the airline has been getting worse and worse.

### "regard for passengers appalling"
London to Male via Abu Dhabi. My wife, myself and our two young children (2 years and 6 months old respectively) flew last night from London to Abu Dhabi. Had our flight left on time we would have had two hours to catch our connecting flight to Male. This didn't happen and our flight left London roughly two hours later than it should have done which put our connecting flight at risk. That said we had made up some time and landed at 8am with our connecting flight was at 8:40am. The warning signs appeared on the flight when the crew were evasive when asked for advice, simply telling us to talk to the Etihad 'transit staff'. After we rushed off the plane we were apprehended by the transit staff who made us sit in a waiting area for ten minutes without offering an explanation. We gave up on this and ran to our gate, arriving at 8:25 only to be told we needed to have been there five minutes prior to this point in order to Board (20 minute limit is imposed). We were carrying exhausted young children and at this point my wife burst into tears. We were then shuttled to another transit area, on foot which took ~30 minutes, half dragging/carrying our poor kids. The line at this location was about an hour and a half long with one staff member dealing with ~60 similar issues by themselves. If you ever need to see how a company treats its most vulnerable, captive passengers this place gave it all away. Most of the women were in tears. At this point our children were close to breaking point but we were fortunate to find a kind Etihad employee walking by who took us to alternative transit area. There we were told we had been re-booked on a 00:55 flight and we would be put up in a £40 a night hotel 37km away. The staff in the transit area were aggressive and refused to discuss the logistics of how we were supposed to get two small children, without buggies/strollers, to this destination. Most importantly they refused to discuss why we would have to wait 15 hours when the airline could not have waited five minutes for us to board. Eventually we were able to relocate to a closer hotel but I write this 7 hours later and we are yet to receive a call telling us where our luggage is. We critically need this because our 6mo old son needs milk, nappies and a change of clothes. Taking him outside in 45c heat to try and find the above is not really acceptable. My final gripe, and I appreciate this is a high quality problem, is that we have now missed a night in a hotel we spent a year planning and saving up to visit. Etihad refuse to discuss compensation and their website doesn't offer any advice. I also believe we are entitled to EU flight delay compensation but they're attempting to use the loophole that since we were changing flights outside of the EU this doesn't hold! Please take care when flying in economy with this airline. Their regard for passengers below business/first class is appalling as is their indifference to the conditions young children travel in.

### "surprised in a positive manner"
Amman to Manila via Abu Dhabi. It was my first time flying with this airline and am very pleased and wish to commend the airline for accommodating people with disabilities. I flew with a knee brace after I injured my knee while. I was very surprised in a positive manner that the aircraft have toilets for PWD. Also the crew accommodated me in a seat where I could stretch my right knee in a relaxing way. Kudos to the flight crew and management for accommodating me and making my flight experience much more pleasant.

### "the service was impeccable"
Flew Kuwait to Mumbai via Abu Dhabi with Etihad. Boarding was effortless at both airports. Despite several negative reviews, the service was impeccable beating all odds. Cabin staff were courteous and attentive and also had a brief chat at the bar. Seafood meal was interesting and sumptuous. Chauffeur at Mumbai Airport was an excellent ride home. The only big negative is the Abu Dhabi Airport which is not Etihad's fault. Sad to see the A380 pulled out from Mumbai route.

### "cancelled out of connecting flight"
Cairo to San Francisco via Abu Dhabi. My flight from Cairo was delayed 2 hours and was not notified via email but upon check in. I was able to get my boarding pass to my connecting direct flight from Abu Dhabi to San Francisco. I was cancelled out of my connecting flight and booked on a different flight while in the air. My family tried several times to re book me on my original flight and were the told that they could not. I arrived an hour before my connecting flight, rushed to the gate and was told I could not get on or change my flight. My flight had been changed without my approval to a non direct flight with an 6 hour layover in Abu Dhabi and another 3 hours layover in LA. I was given a pass to the lounge where I was told I would get a room and could sleep. When I got there I was told there was no rooms available. I put two chairs together to sleep and was woken up and told they had to be separated. Their customer service is awful! I could have made my connecting flight but they wouldn't allow me. I will never fly this airline again and urge you not to either. It is not worth the hassle, aggravation and stress of it all. An original 23 hour journey turned into 38 hours because of incompetence on the airline personnel.

### "rule is not stated anywhere"
Colombo to New York return via Abu Dhabi. Ticket gave fair choices with flexibility to choose each leg independently. We bought the outbound with economy saver and return with economy flex by paying $200 or more, which clearly states "Free date changes and cancellation" under the economy flex rules. Again, everywhere it states above and nowhere it states that you have to buy the ticket separately for each leg to apply the fair rules. If I knew or it was clearly stated, I would have bought two legs separately because there is no concession if ticket is bought with return. So, we bought the ticket by paying more for return leg because we wanted to have the flexibility as stated for free change and refund. When we called Etihad to cancel the flight on 07/16/2017, the representative maintained that refund would not be free because we bought it together with economy saver and most restricted rules apply. This rule is not stated anywhere under the rules of economy flex class rules. I canceled the ticket and they kept $200 although it supposed to be a free refund.

### "only thing consistent is their inconsistency"
Paris to Melbourne via Abu Dhabi with Etihad. Check in at CDG - I had to return to check in to obtain a baggage receipt which was not given to me. From experience it’s needed. Was greeted and offered a drink which never arrived. A meal order was taken and I was asked when I wanted to eat and when. As I had snacked in the lounge I didn’t want it for a few hours. However it arrived quite soon after take off along with other passengers’ meals. Again no drink which was ordered. The usual bottle of water was not waiting in my seat or offered during the flight. Dessert was ordered. Again it never arrived. About seven hours later I asked for an item from the Etihad order at any time menu. It arrived 45 minutes later. I had to ask twice for something to drink. Entertainment was largely not interesting and was much the same as my flight seven weeks previously. My priority tagged luggage arrived an hour after landing as I was completing a lost luggage claim. Last year my luggage arrived a week later. The only thing consistent about Etihad is their inconsistency.

### "won't recommend it to anyone"
I travelled from Helsinki to Dar es Salaam via Berlin and Abu Dhabi, with Air Berlin and Etihad Airways. I arrived in Dar es salaam and my luggage was missing until today, 3 weeks later. I have returned to Finland since and was told by Etihad Tanzania that they found my luggage and they have sent it back to Finland - which i was supposed to get on 10th July. Unfortunately until today I haven't received it and the weird thing is that, when I ask Etihad Tanzania why I haven't got my luggage, they tell me that "they can't get hold on Etihad Finland to deliver my luggage".. When i contact Etihad Finland, they say "we have no idea of my issue and therefore I should contact back to Etihad Tanzania". I decided to contact Helsinki airport and they confirm that they don't have my luggage. It has been 22 days since my luggage was missing and according to the policy after 21 days of missing luggage, they have to pay me, so they are trying to trick me by lying to me that they have found my luggage but there is a problem with delivering. Be aware of this airline. I won't recommend it to anyone.

### "poor service and treatment"
Abu Dhabi to Cairo. I usually fly by Etihad Airways. On my trip to Cairo on 9th July I was shocked with the poor service and treatment of one of the hostess which I could not imagine how she was been hired by Etihad Airways with such negative attitude. Other passengers complained as well of her attitude and her supervisor came and apologized on her behalf.

### "discourteous, dispassionate"
Abu Dhabi to Los Angeles. Three of us : wife, kid and me were located in different seats, despite requesting multiple times. Same experience with others in the flight. The crew was heartlessly watching as people requested one another to be allowed to sit to the next of kin. Very discourteous, dispassionate crew. Everyone on the flight said that they wouldn't be flying with them again.

### "stay away from Etihad"
I had a flight from Jeddah to Melbourne via Abu Dhabi, and finally from Melbourne to Sydney. I specifically chose to go the longer route via Melbourne so that I could get to Sydney on Tuesday night as I had a day full of meetings on Wednesday. I got to Jeddah airport 3 hours before the flight and was able to easily get through the check in and immigration procedures and was on the plane by about 4.15pm with the flight due to depart st 5pm. Unfortunately the flight did not depart at 5pm due to Etihad deciding to wait for passengers and eventually departed over an hour later at about 6.15pm. We were due to arrive in Abu Dhabi at 8.40pm and my connecting flight to Melbourne was at 10.10pm. I anxiously hoped we would pick up speed and get there on time but we arrived at about 9.30pm instead. I desperately needed to make my connecting flight so I checked the gate number on the screen before we arrived and it was gate 61 which was in Terminal 3 and we were arriving in terminal 1. As soon we disembarked I ran as fast as I could to gate 61 and made it to the gate and through security while others were still boarding. As I was about to get on the flight the Etihad personnel said that I was rebooked and could not board the flight. I explained that I had run from my previous flight and there was still 25 minutes till the schedule departure and that I should be allowed to get on this flight. While we were debating several other people who came after me were allowed on the flight which I thought was just wrong. They eventually sent me to the transfer desk who arranged a hotel and meal voucher for me. I was expected to sleep in my already sweaty clothes and come back in the same clothes with no compensation or allowance for some temporary clothes. I asked them to allocate me the same exit row window seat that I had on my original flight and they were not willing to do that. They did not even arrange for me to have my special meal on my rebooked flight. I eventually ended up at the hotel which required me to pass immigration and leave the airport and then after about a 20 minute drive get to a hotel. There is a Transit hotel in the airport which would not require you to leave the transit area or the airport and clearly to save money they booked me into a Holiday Inn outside of the airport. I then about the meal voucher and it was limited to 50AED. That amount would only pay for a sandwich but not even a soft drink which is again ridiculously cheap. I then had to be ready for pickup at 8am in the morning for my flight at 10.45am. I was taken to the airport and as my bags were checked in I was sitting at the gate over 2 hours before the flight which was completely unnecessary as I had to rush out of the hotel and didn't have a chance to shower before I left and now I was stuck waiting at the gate. If they has just booked me into the transit hotel in the airport I would not have this situation. I asked if I could use the lounge to pass some time and was refused. I then realised that all of this hype about Etihad being the world's best customer service airline was a big scam. I would advise anyone who expects good customer service to stay away from Etihad.

### "staff attentive and professional"
Abu Dhabi to London. Check in and security was great. Even though I had to go to another desk to pay cash for my excess baggage, I was through to my gate in 20 minutes! On the plane, I was asked if I could move to a seat behind so a mother and child could sit together which was fine. The food was good, I had mac and cheese although I did not like the bean and peas vegetable mix and would have preferred a salad. For entertainment there was a good variety of Hollywood, European, Indian, and some Asian cinema as well as TV shows. I would quite like to see more Asian movies as there were only around three. Seat-wise, I had enough legroom in a normal seat as did the gentleman seated next to me. After a while, I got a little sore but who doesn't when they are seated for hours on end? The staff were attentive and professional, even when there were pesky passengers rushing down the aisle to the doors literally as soon as the plane had landed and had to be repeatedly told to go back to their seats. All in all, a great flight.

### "they only had veggie meals"
Dallas to Abu Dhabi. A disappointment! Starting from check in, asking us to repack because of one extra kg in one of my bags. On board, the crew is unproffessional. At first they gave my 6 yrs old son a pack of games and coloring booklets and ignored his 8 year old sister sitting next to him. For meals, they only had veggie meals. They said the beef and chicken meals they had are much fewer than veggie and they ran out of it very early! I had two veggie meals in the 14 hours trip. After finishing my meals I waited for about 30 minutes for someone to collect the trash. Overall, highly overrated, unfriendly crew.

### "cramped uncomfortable seating"
Melbourne to Dammam via Abu Dhabi. Boeing 777 was a tired old cabin with very cramped uncomfortable seating and my knee kept knocking against the tray table support. Food was below standard and the IFE was pretty awful with very limited choice, hardly many up to date films available unlike Qatar Airways. Although the seat transformed into a flat bed it was so narrow you had no space to turn over and the blanket just kept getting dropped into the aisle way of the plane. Crew were good which was a saving grace, but this plane on a major long haul flight of 13hrs+ desperately needs the new model of business class and a more spacious seat when it comes to sleeping. The A320 from Abu Dhabi to Dammam was a more modern aircraft and pleasant to seat even if it was designed for short haul. Bothe flights left on time and arrived early so hope Eithad continue with on time schedules.

### "cabin crew extremely attentive and helpful"
Flew Abu Dhabi to Brisbane. Good: Business class suite in dreamliner was extremely comfortable for a long-haul flight. Great lie-flat bed, comfortable pillow and blanket and bed made up by cabin crew, comfy pyjamas supplied, lots of space to put your stuff, nice toiletries provided. I slept well for about 7 hours. Food was excellent, as was the service. The cabin crew were extremely attentive and helpful. Bathroom for business class was not as cramped as economy, with hand lotion and face spray on offer. Questionable: The entertainment on offer fell far short of virtually any other airline I have flown - there were very few quality movies or TV shows to watch. A bit disappointing for such a large airline. The lighting and different buttons for everything needed quite a bit of explanation. Outgoing flight delayed so my baggage missed the connecting flight in Brisbane.

### "it was difficult for staff"
Abu Dhabi to Dhaka. Almost 99% passengers on that flight was Bangladeshi and it was difficult for staff to keep everything in order where most of the passengers don't speak English and also passengers were not aware of flight safety. I suggest that as Abu Dhabi to Dhaka passenger is Bangladeshi, they can make a short video about flight safety and other important things explained to passengers in Bengali language.

### "appalling standard of the food"
I flew Manchester to Bangkok via Abu Dhabi (return) with Etihad. The return flight was delayed due to technical issues but overall the flights were comfortable given I was in economy class. My gripe was with the appalling standard of the food. I've flown Etihad many times over the years and at one time the food and in-flight service was very good in my opinion. That's all changed. The fodder they dish out now (in mean portions) is dreadful. In years gone by you received a little menu describing the meal choices available. That has been replaced by the cabin attendant shouting, "chicken, beef or pasta? over the noise of the engines. Many people would argue that if you want decent cuisine you should fly business not economy. Perhaps but the food in economy was unacceptable. Next time I will choose another airline.

### "luggage stuck in Abu Dhabi"
New York to Kuwait via Abu Dhabi. I arrived to Kuwait 3 days ago, and my luggage got stuck in Abu Dhabi and didn't get shipped back to me until now. My stay in the country was only for 3-4 days, and I had to spend time shopping for clothes. I've been calling for the past couple days and never got a solid answer to when my luggage will arrive to me. I fly back tonight, and my luggage is still not be back yet. I won't recommend this airline, as this is the second time this happens to me. thank you!

### "Crew attentive throughout"
Generally excellent albeit I was avoiding the horror that is a transfer at Abu Dhabi airport. Check in was slow with only two desks open for economy passengers, a long queue ensuing. Push back was precisely on time, as it generally is at Perth - which must be among the best performing airports in the world on this measure, with a 30 minute early arrival in Abu Dhabi on an airbridge - a rarity. With the flight less than half full plenty of space to stretch out. Notwithstanding, leg room on this newish plane was ample, far better than Qatar for example, the seat comfortable enough. Excellent IFE selection - I passed the time watching the men's semi finals at the French tennis open live from Roland Garos / BBC news reporting on the election - with large high quality screens though these were not without issues namely light and distraction, I question whether it is appropriate for films with extreme violence such as The Revenant to be made available on IFE, especially when you have no choice to switch off. Crew attentive throughout with regular water runs but no recognition of my Gold status. The two special meals supplied - vegetable curries - were tasty if a little basic, no sweet. Extra plus point, however: I was provided with my choice of drink with the meal, a matter invariably 'forgotten' by crew on previous flights. Wifi was available but not used. Bags delivered within 15 minutes of leaving aircraft. In the taxi on my way home 25 minutes after the wheels touched down.

### "was one of the best flights"
Melbourne to Paris via Abu Dhabi, I was upgraded from business to first class. First Class on the A380 is another dimension in terms of comfort and service. Lounge in Melbourne is sensational and the service superb. Boarding was smooth and escorted to suite 2C. Promptly offered a glass of Champagne and cabin crew introduced themselves and explained how all the buttons etc worked. Take off on time and an excellent meal followed by some movies and then the bed was made up for me and slept for 7 hours. Gently woken for breakfast and landing superb. Flight to Paris in 777-300 which was in excellent condition and again the crew were great. Dine on demand and constant checks on water requirements etc. This was one of the best flights I have had.

### "I am extremely disappointed"
Hong Kong to Abu Dhabi. I am extremely disappointed in this airline I have had numerous problems occur within one trip with them. Firstly they overbooked my flight by 4 people and I was one of the people who had to go on a different flight, I was unhappy so they gave me a $300 Etihad transport voucher to compensate. That was fine however when I landed in my destination my luggage had been mishandled by Etihad in a transit through Brisbane. I didn't get my luggage until 2 days after I had landed. When my luggage arrived to my house the handle on my suitcase had completely broken off and it was fine beforehand. I tried to at least earn miles from this awful experience. I joined the Etihad guest membership online and followed the instructions to claim miles with them through email. I sent an email to them 3 days ago still no reply other than an automated message saying "we have received your email we will reply asap". So I wasn't able to claim miles for my flight. I wanted to use the voucher given to me worth $300. I often fly to the UAE so I found a flight to Abu Dhabi partly operated by Etihad airways via Hong Kong from New Zealand. I called them to confirm I could use my voucher on a flight which is partly operated by Etihad and I was told I could but I have to call them directly to make a booking. I called again to make a booking and was told I couldn't use my voucher on a flight partly operated by them. I can't use my voucher on any flight operated just by them because they don't fly in or out of New Zealand which is where I live. I'm very angry at this company and their unprofessional staff.

### "belligerent staff at check in"
Flew Etihad Airways from Sydney to Manchester via Abu Dhabi. Going out I would have said it was one of the best airlines I had flown with but changed my mind on the return flight with the abysmal treatment I was given by a belligerent staff member at check in at Manchester airport. One of the reasons for picking the airline was that I had a 30kg allowance and on fronting up to the desk my bag weighed 29kg. The staff member said it was too heavy and when I explained I had the 30kg allowance she would not accept this and told me to empty some into the rubbish and queue up again. I did this and 2 1/4 hours later I was at her desk again. My bag now weighed 26kg and she said I had to pay 94 pounds and could have 32kg. Not only had I run out of time to retrieve my goods from the rubbish I then had to pay this amount and carry on. I was appalled at the treatment and really disillusioned by the whole process and would be reluctant to fly with this airline again! My hand luggage complied with the rules.

### "very disappointed and upset"
Flying Etihad for the first time from San Francisco to Bangalore via Abu Dhabi. Usually fly British Airways which has a much better service. I had asked for a Hindu meal which said no beef. So here I am in Business class and everyone is ordering off from the menu and when I asked for something from the All Day Menu, they tell me I cannot order anything at all as I will get only the two fixed meals. No snacks, no appetizers, nothing at all except for the 2 assigned meals that they have on board for me. Am so very disappointed and upset. Doesn't help that the people next to me have been eating continuously. So on a 12 hrs flight I get 2 meals and nothing else. I have traveled economy in Qatar and been offered snacks, sandwiches etc - never again.

### "a wonderful flight"
Again a wonderful flight with Etihad from Hyderabad to New York via Abu Dhabi. It is our third time with them. The primary consideration is fare and convenience, and Etihad checked the boxes again. The flight itself was very comfortable, on time, but it was the staff and service that makes them our favorites. The small but useful convenience kit even in economy is a nice touch. The seats were standard, the entertainment more than adequate and the food average. Slept 8 hours in the 13 hour flight. Comfortable blankets and the head support on the seat is a nice thing to have. Check in was smooth, baggage arrived intact, connection was a breeze, and the US pre-clearance meant that exit at JFK was easy. One thing to keep in mind is the 45 minute to 1 hour wait for the pre-clearance for US flights. Will fly them again in a heartbeat.

### "what a poor service"
My second experience with Etihad and I have decided not going to fly with them again. In Madrid we have been boarded 1 hour early and we have to wait inside the plane for almost 2 hours. The pilot keeps promising we will fly in 15 min. During the waiting time, we only get crackers and drinks. We dont get any sorry or clear explanation. During the flight we only get 1 meal for a 6 hour flight. What a poor service.

### "inadequate business class seats"
Abu Dhabi to Rome. Very disappointed about the cabin in general. Very old 777 with inadequate business class seats. There is no space to place any item anywhere unless you open the small table but this preclude you from laying down flat the seat. I was expecting at least an amenity kit with ear plugs (777 is very very noisy) and a toothbrush but nothing was given. Cabin crew stressing too much about consuming meal and buying things from duty free. Disembarkation of business class together with economy class in a confused manner and this is not acceptable for a 5 star airline.

### "dreading my flight back"
Went on Etihad as a second leg of my journey from Berlin to Kuala Lumpur. After a good and pleasant flight on Air Berlin and a much needed shower and rest at the Al-Reem Lounge at the Abu Dhabi airport, the journey on Etihad in Economy Class felt like a prison. Flight was fully booked and very noisy. Seating arrangements on plane was 2-4-2 with very little legroom and narrow seat pitch. My partner who is 6'4" had to put his legs to the aisle to avoid pressing onto the chair of the person in front of us. The saving glory was that the entertainment onboard was good and cabin crew was pleasant. Food was only ok. Throughout the flight I was so uncomfortable and hot that I kept fidgeting and tossing and turning trying to find a comfortable position, which I was not able to. Dreading my flight back to Berlin already.

### "I'll find other options"
Bangalore to Cairo via Abu Dhabi. The first leg (BLR-AUH) was a morning flight at 10 am. The flight was empty only 50 passengers on board. Nobody was sitting beside making the flight really comfortable. The screen in front of me was a low resolution and small screen. After an hour, they served curry chicken meal. It was quite awkward to have lunch at breakfast time. At landing at Abu Dhabi, the plane did not stop at any gate bridges. The passengers were transported in busses. I saw a lot of gate bridges empty but I don't know why they did so. It was hot in Abu Dhabi at that time and the air conditioning was not functioning. The second leg (AUH-CAI) was also an A321. The flight was full and there were a lot of carry-on bags on board. We got boarded from a non-gate bridge as well. The gate was in the basement of the Abu Dhabi airport. The air conditioning was terrible and it was really hot. The air conditioning in the buses to the plane was bad as well. The cabin crew was pushing the passengers during boarding the plane to put all our duty-free bags underneath the chair in front. The passengers behind me were two kids with their mom on board. They kept opening their table tray and slapping it back several and several times. I asked one of the cabin crew to just talk them. To my surprise, she told me that she couldn't do anything with a big smile on her face. I had to rotate back and shout at their Mum. The kids stopped for a while but then they started to kick my chair during the whole flight. I convinced myself to watch a movie in that bad screen to watch a movie to forget about that kid. Every 10 mins, the movie stopped automatically and switched back to the main menu. The passenger beside me had the same thing with his tiny screen. The second leg was an annoying flight. I'll find other options than Etihad Airways

### "screen low resolution and small"
I checked-in online smoothly through Etihad mobile app and choose aisle seats specifically since I like to stand up a lot during any flight. The first leg from Cairo to Abu Dhabi was an empty flight. Only 50 passengers were on board. I stretched my legs on the three seats. Breakfast was great as well. The screen in front of the seat is a low resolution and small. You can barely see the movie on the screen. The screen was also bad in the next leg as well. The problem began on the 2nd leg, Abu Dhabi to Bangalore. The flight was full. There were a lot of carry-ons on board. There was nearly no space in the compartments. I had to put my bag four rows behind me. I looked at my seat number and found out it is a window seat, not an aisle I selected when I checked in online. Three kids took my seat and requested me to swap with another middle seat. Four hours in a middle seat was really annoying. I ordered water before serving the meals but the flight attendant told me to wait for a while since they are preparing the meals. I had to wait for more than half an hour. The meals available were either vegetarian or chicken since most passengers were Indian. I took a chicken meal and it did not taste good at all.

### "are a very good airline"
Johannesburg to Doha via Abu Dhabi. I was told by the booking agent that the route from Abu Dhabi to Johannesburg is operated on a Boeing 787-9 which was true on my outbound journey but on the flight back I was surprised by walking onto an A330-200 which if anyone has flown on Etihad is their worst configured aircraft because it does not have any central overhead storage! When I inquired with one of the flight attendants why the change of equipment he insulted my intelligence by saying the outbound service is on a Boeing 787-9 and the return is on an A330-200 which is impossible as the same aircraft that leaves has to return. The seats on the A330-200 are better than the 787 but the entertainment system is outdated and the toilets are tiny and have an annoying angled wall that makes standing awkward! The service was very good but the steak I had for dinner was badly done and had strange smell to it just before arriving I had a cereal . Arriving in Abu Dhabi was slightly delayed and we had to use the staircase which is always annoying , the connecting flight to Doha was also delayed and for a strange reason the pilot took us for a rather long taxi which seemed more like a tour of Abu Dhabi Airport, actually it felt longer than the short flight to Doha, but the service was also very good and the arrival in Doha was smooth. Etihad are a very good airline and I believe after the opening of the new airport they will improve their services even more but they stand out on their baggage policy which make them an amazing package !

### "Do not fly through Abu Dhabi"
Abu Dhabi to Chicago. The airline and lounge were very good. If it was that simple I would not recommend anyone to fly in and out of Abu Dhabi airport. My father who is 95 years old was berated by a policeman for not taking off his shoes. He was perfectly willing to take off his shoes but the wheelchair person dropped him off before the metal detector and said another wheelchair would get him after the metal detector. This is when the policeman yelled at him for not taking off his shoes. I was visibly upset and I told the policeman so. He was enraged that I questioned his treatment of my father and asked us to step out of line. He also threatened to jail us. A senior Etihad employee intervened and pleaded with the officer to let us through. We were finally let through, but only after my father was so shaken that he had an awful flight to Chicago. Do not fly through Abu Dhabi.

### "cost cutting initiatives"
Was "codeshared" by Air France onto Etihad operated flight from Paris to Abu Dhabi. Checking in allowed no choice of seat presumably due to different computer systems but altogether a bit annoying when you have booked an AF flight and are Platinum level. Ground staff very obliging moved me to slightly better window seat. Flight packed (as they all are these days - see reviews about cheap flights to far east! ), cabin crew under a fair bit of pressure but coped pretty well. Food standard seems to have dropped a lot though, no doubt cost cutting initiatives - small things you notice - no fresh rolls with the meal, little cheese block on tray gone now it seems, no snack before landing. Can it really save that much overall? IFE pretty sparse and doesn't get changed much, nothing special about seats or overall general discomfort! As usual only 20 or so people actually getting off the flight in Abu Dhabi - everyone else in transit presumably with their much cheaper tickets - very annoying pricing policy for people actually living in Abu Dhabi.

### "a lowest airfare strategy"
Dusseldorf to Singapore via Abu Dhabi. The focus of this review is purely on the flight, not the (rather uncomfortable) airport Abu Dhabi. Etihad (at least in Germany) seems to follow a lowest airfare strategy for Business Class flights to Asia. You pay this with a transfer (usually during night hours). During all four legs of my recent trip, Etihad's personel were very friendly but also seemed all relatively inexperienced. During two legs, I asked the flight attendants to hang my suits. After arrival, I had to ask for it. This would for sure come automatically with other airlines. All flights very punctual. Boarding well organized, never stressful. Food was OK. One time I was told the Arabic appetizer set was already out and 20 mins later I saw another passenger getting this set. Wine selection was good - they could work on their choice of fruit juices. Airplanes: all brand new 787. For me, the most comfortable plane currently on the market. IFE: OK, selection of movies limited compared to other airlines. In flight wifi did not work.

### "the food was great"
I have been very loyal with Etihad and this trio (Doha to Johannesburg via Abu Dhabi) was the best in a while. There are unpleasant parts but they are to do with Abu Dhabi Airport being congested and cannot be attributed to the airline. The departure from Doha was an early morning one so I could not get much sleep. An uneventful flight being a very short one and arrival in Abu Dhabi was earlier than schedule but because of the congestion at the airport we had to remote park and use the stairs which is very annoying when you have a sleeping child. The connecting flight was the same story but a much higher the staircase, the seats on the 787 are nicer than the A380 and the whole experience was better. Etihad falls short of both Qatar Airways and Emirates on the entertainment scale but surpasses everyone on the baggage policy. The food was great. I really liked the steak sandwich and their chicken. My daughter loved the pasta. We had a very strong tail wind and arrived an hour early. Their wifi was great I kept in contact with my wife the whole journey.

### "Easy connection in Abu Dhabi"
Jeddah to Bangkok via Abu Dhabi. Departure delayed around 50 minutes due to chaos at immigration in Jeddah Airport. All other sectors out and return on time. All planes clean. Reasonable selection of films but issues with not turning the IFE on promptly and turning it off too early. 2 screens broken. 2 seats had broken USB connectors preventing charging of phones. Too many adverts prior to films. One broken seat Abu Dhabi to Bangkok but only 80% full so eaay to change. Staff pleasant. Food generally okay, filling but bland. Easy connection in Abu Dhabi.

### "not be using Etihad in future"
Abu Dhabi to London on 10th May. My worst flight ever. The cabin crew were the laziest I have flown with. I realise they are entitled to a break but they entered the cabin twice during the flight once with lunch and once for a snack near the end of the flight. My sister could not even get any water, the crew ignored the bell and switched it off without even coming to see if there was a problem. After lunch was finished the curtain was closed and if you went to use the toilet behind the curtain you were told to use the one at the rear of the aircraft. I will not be using Etihad in the future.

### "food and service were mediocre"
Paris to Hyderabad via Abu Dhabi. I had booked a return journey 8 months prior to the trip. Before the trip I had received 3 emails about my return flight stating that my flight has been rescheduled, but the difference was 10 minutes only. (ie. my 10 pm flight was rescheduled to 9.50 pm). I had booked the meal and everything was fine. On the day of the travel, me and my wife boarded a below par airplane from Hyderabad to Abu Dhabi. The charger point was not working, the food was served 2 hours afted the departure with no refreshments. Even after pressing the call button to get the flight attendent's attention i did not get any response. The food was not great and nothing except the dinner was served. My next flight from Abu dhabi to Paris was slightly better but again food served was mediocre. The main story started in the return leg. As mentioned, i was suppose to travel back at 9.50 PM from paris. when i arrived to drop my bag, I found that my flight had already departed at 10 am that morning. I was told that the same was informed to me via email. Luckily i had not deleted any mail from etihad and i was able to show them that the flight change was for 10 min not 12 hours! I was scared as this was the first time such thing happened to me. They told me to talk to the reservation website. Luckily i had booked the flight from etihad website itself and therefore I was able to push them to call their reservation desk. The manager came to me and started talking to the reservation office. It was realised than an email was dropped to me 20 days before the travel date with the mentioned changes. I was able to find the email but it just provide the receipt of payment with no mention of details of change in time. Etihad was not able to explain the reason and as there were seats available they were able to book us on the same flight after a lot of argument. Even though it was the airline that was at fault the manager had the audacity to tell me that I should be more careful next time. Then one more issue presented itself. The flight I booked had 2 hours of waiting time in Abu Dhabi. For the flight that etihad gave me later I had to wait 8 hours at Abu Dhabi airport. I was so frustrated and tired that I did not argue and just wished that i reach my home. Again the food and service in the return flights were mediocre.

### "seem to be losing ground"
Abu Dhabi to Sydney. The crew were great, the aircraft getting a little tired. The big size PJs were back in stock and the service left on time. I'm a big guy, the business class seats are only just big enough for me. The table is a bit tight on my guts so I lean the chair back. Qatar Airways tables have more room, I have no issues with them. Etihad remain my first choice but seem to be losing ground with tired aircraft interiors in the older fleet. I wish I could get some sort of wifi frequent flyer before I fly - I'm always scared to buy on board.

### "was a pleasant night flight"
Kuala Lumpur to Abu Dhabi. It was a pleasant night flight. The gate was pretty full, but the airport staff handled the situation very well. I pre selected our seats for free, we had the last seats in the first economy segment. There is no restricted recline, which is very nice, because you do not bother anyone by reclining your seat. The staff was attentive and the food delicious for economy and the IFE was good. They offer a solid economy experience. I would fly them again, but I still prefer Qatar Airways and Emirates.

### "nothing fancy on this leg"
Abu Dhabi to Doha. The 3am run to Doha uses an old aircraft crammed with workers in transit. Business class is not much different to economy, and it's often full of people who have been pumped up. This is a hardline, workers transit flight. If your flying business don't be fooled, nothing fancy on this leg. The good news is if it's part of a longer haul flight the other leg will likely have been awesome - Etihad awesome, which is fantastic.

### "crew were back on their game"
Sydney to Abu Dhabi. Etihad crew were back on their game with this afternoon flight. Exceptional service on the smaller Boeing 777. I like it better than the A380 with air controls I can customise and in an aircraft that feels like it's flying, and not the QE2. Okay, the menu has not changed in a while, and it's getting a little tired in the fit out, but for me 10 out of 10 on this flight on this route, with this crew.

### "experience unforgettably horrible"
Manila to Frankfurt via Abu Dhabi. A recent family trip to Frankfurt gave me the chance to travel with Etihad Airways and I had high expectations in terms of their service. Unfortunately, the experience was an unforgettably horrible one. As I was boarding the gate in Manila, Etihad’s ground staff informed me that my seat did not recline and had no light or power. To add insult to injury, the seat area had a pungent odor. Since this was a family trip with a connecting flight and nobody could offer me a workable solution, I had to have the seat manually adjusted to a flat recline and endure a 9-hour flight without lights or power. To cap it off, the stewardess directed me to go to the toilet at the back end of business class when I went to the business class toilet near the cockpit, as if I was bothering them. To make up for my discomfort, I was handed a letter saying that they have given me free miles equivalent to a polo shirt from their souvenir store. As a frequent flyer, I found this an unjust compensation for the level of distress I experienced on such a long flight, so I decided to return the letter and reject the offer. I then proceeded to email a formal complaint to their customer service only to receive the same proposal despite my objections the first time. I decided to raise my concern to their CEO and was surprised and disappointed to get the same reply from a customer service agent who continued to insist on their offer. I just want to share how let down I felt as a customer of an airline as purportedly reputable as Etihad Airways.

### "drink, food and comfort excellent"
Melbourne to London via Abu Dhabi. Trip started well with the two female staff at the Melbourne Etihad Lounge proving themselves top cocktail mixers, producing an Aperol Spritz, an Espresso Martini and a G & T of the best quality. Trip to Abu Dhabi faultless - staff, drink, food and comfort excellent. The lounge was busy and the showers could not be accessed due to time constraints. On to London, equally as good. Movie choices somewhat limited on both sectors.

### "plane clean but leg space small"
Amman to Abu Dhabi with Etihad. Initial online booking issues and had to call the Abu Dhabi office. Check in at Amman ok - however, luggage issues due to overweight bags. Gate check in smooth. Plane was clean but leg space too small. Snack (a hot cheese sandwich had no taste) and cold turkey sandwich was dry (only bread and turkey cold cut). Service friendly. Onboard WiFi not working.

### "changed for the good"
I was having zero expectation with this trip with Etihad considering my last terrible experience on same route (Doha to Kozhikode via Abu Dhabi). But things seems to be changed for the good (or I was too lucky this time!) Flight out of Doha was fully packed. They served a so called sandwich with a slice of cheese and tomato in between a cold loaf. Where their competitors serve a full tray with tea or coffee and other one with warm sandwich, cupcakes and juice. No drinks were offered and they disappeared after serving this "meal". Second flight out of Abu Dhabi to Kozhikode was light load and early morning departure crew were very attentive and smiling throughout which I was very much surprised to see. Especially the supervisor everytime she pass by the cabin, was found smiling to the passengers. May be because the flight was not full and they were not under stress. But the breakfast served was complete bland with only two choices, pre packed cold croissant was offered and portion size was very small. Overall still surprised by the fact attitude of the crew has been changed in both sectors. A good note to the airline

### "my luggage was lost upon arrival"
Had the worst experience flying with Etihad. Service from staff was terrible, complete lack of attention  to customers. Unfortunately my luggage was lost upon my arrival in Melbourne. They said they would be in contact with me either later that evening or the following day and that they would give me an updated status to where my luggage. After not hearing from them by the evening of the following day, I decided to call them and see what the current status of my luggage was. They told me that my luggage was still in Berlin as it had not made it onto the plane. Again, they said they would keep me informed and let me know the status of my luggage. After hearing nothing from them the following day (3rd day) and having to call in again, I was finally told my luggage was in Melbourne. After countless calls to customer services and email correspondences between Etihad, a month later, I finally received my money back. On my way back to Budapest from Melbourne, I was told to pick up my boarding pass from Etihad services in Abu Dhabi for my next lay over in Rome. I was shooed away by Etihad staff and told I would receive my boarding pass in Rome. When landing in Rome, I was not allowed through security as I had no boarding pass and no one at Etihad services would help me. I finally made it through after a struggle with security.

### "I sent the gift back to Etihad"
Bangkok to Zurich via Abu Dhabi. August 2016 I fly with my Girlfriend. Unfortunally the flight from Abu Dhabi to Zurich was overbooked. So we they let us stay in Abu Dhabi. 10 Hours later we had a flight to Geneva. In Geneva another Transit time of 4 Hours and than a flight to Zurich. So the whole trip cost us more than 24hrs. The gift of Etihad was a voucher for 300 US Dollar for each of us. Now I would like to book a flight with this voucher for a friend, but this is not possible. Even they know that I paid both tickets. The voucher is only valid for me and my girlfriend. I cannot book for a third Person. So I sent the gift back to Etihad by today! There is no any more reason to book that airline. They even don't look for solutions.

### "lowering its standards in business-class"
Check-In at Ho Chi Minh City was fast with my boarding-pass printed out already. Got special assistance to get through passport and security-checks. Very friendly staff. Welcome on board was warm and efficient, the food and beverage manager even remembered me from an earlier flight. My seat was changed from window to a center-seat without even informing me. Seat (business-class) very narrow and under par from key competitors with a 50/50% divide of seat and a 'side-table' (where the guest behind puts his feet for sleeping). No head-rest cover (unhygienic). No amenity kit any more for a long haul overnight flight (staff informed me that they discontinued offering them). Eat-when-you-like option is nice but dinner is served on a tray like in economy-class. Flight crew were efficient and friendly throughout the flight. Bad sleep because of no eye-shades offered. Flight arrived on time so easy to make my connection to Frankfurt. Etihad lounge in AUH overcrowded, hard to find a seat. Service on my continuing flight from AUH to FRA was excellent again. My lunch-choice was not available, yet they managed to get it for me. Again no amenity-kits. One of the bathrooms was wet and dirty, so better to keep your shoes on (I didn't) because of lack of slippers. Couldn't sleep because of day-flight and no eye-shades offered. Could not freshen up before landing because no razor-set or even a tooth-brush offered. Arrived Frankfurt on time. My verdict: while service at Etihad is still excellent the seats in business-class are small and uncomfortable because of bad design and the airline seems to cut costs by lowering its standards in business-class.

### "seats were incredibly uncomfortable"
Dusseldorf to Hong Kong via Abu Dhabi. I had some expectations which have't been completely fulfilled. Well this is how life is, you can't have it all even from a 5* airline (for first class cabin, though). Flying economy didn't seem like a 5* airline at all. And the seats were incredibly uncomfortable, and in the Boeing 787-9 the configuration is bad. You don't really feel it until it is completely full, like the last haul when coming back (night flight) from Abu Dhabi to Dusseldorf. When 3 people are sitting next to each other, no matter how big or small it is almost impossible to sleep. Another bad thing for me was that the entertainment system closes 45 minutes before landing (really?) and it is available only after take off after the proper altitude has been reached. You just have to do something else 45 minutes before landing. The screen were big enough and the variety of programs was good. As a platinum Etihad Airways frequent flyer I was allowed to use the very nice first class lounge in Abu Dhabi. An inconvenience happened in Hong Kong, when travelling with my girlfriend and being on the same reservation together, it was just me who got an invitation to join the departure lounge of Hong Kong Airlines. This I found really impolite and if this means customer satisfaction by cutting costs, then they are cutting in the wrong place. We refused to use the lounge and went for a drink at one of the cafes in the airport. The food onboard was probably not a lot but the quality of the products was the best in economy I had so far. I have prebooked a vegetarian meal and they were pretty nice and paid attention to these details. The best from all the flights was that they were ahead of schedule in all the flights (sometimes 30-40 minutes) and this means they are interested in getting you to your destination in time, which is a big plus. As an overall rating I would give them 3* for economy, this is where they are, according to my personal view.

### "seats are very uncomfortable"
Hyderabad to Chicago via Abu Dhabi with Etihad Airways. Staff is friendly, but the flight is horrendous, seats are very uncomfortable. Sliding tray in the first seat doesn't always go inside. The screens don't register touch very well. They didn't have enough pillows for everyone. Vegetarian meal is of poor quality. At the time of breakfast, they offered turkey sandwich when I had clearly marked my meal as vegetarian. This is after serving the vegetarian meal before. There is no room in overhead bins. The temparature was set at least 78 degrees probably more. It was hot as hell.

### "cabin staff friendly and helpful"
London to Doha via Abu Dhabi with Etihad Airways. This was my return sector, a daytime flight from London. Check in was slow but the staff were very friendly but that did not give us time to enjoy the Etihad lounge at Heathrow. Etihad's business class on the A380 was nicely laid out but leg area is narrow and if you are over 1.9 meters tall you will have to bend your knees in the sleeping position, not so nice. The cabin staff were very friendly and helpful, the entertainment system was alright and the food was very good. I chose the chicken with edamame which was a very good choice. The landing was quite rough in Abu Dhabi but the Lounge in Abu Dhabi was superb. The short connecting flight back to Doha was uneventful.

### "a pleasant trip"
Flew Etihad Airways from Paris to Abu Dhabi. Even though the planes are a bit older, the comfort inside was quite good, space was enough. Crew were kind and selection of food and beverages was definitely enough for such a trip. The best part of the flight was probably the entertainment system, the movie selection was really nice, a lovely way to spend a pleasant trip.

### "So disappointed with service"
London to Perth return via Abu Dhabi. I was looking forward to my fly with this airline. It was total of 4 flights. So disappointed with service and attitude from the staff. Those stewardess looked like they not bothered to be there, so unhappy, rude, impolite. If we tried to ask them something, seemed everything was too hard for them, they even was not listening and not letting us to finish a sentence. Every time it's seemed that they are not happy with something. We felt not welcomed. Bathrooms was often untidy. Food was ok. I am not sure if I want to fly with Etihad again

### "service continued to go downhill"
I was extremely disappointed in the service my husband and I received on our flights using Etihad Airways. We first flew from Dublin to Abu Dhabi using Etihad and thought that the poor service could have been a fluke but we were wrong. On our direct flight home from Abu Dhabi to Toronto the service continued to go downhill. The flight attendants were rude and not helpful. It took over an hour for someone to come to us when we turned on our attendant light. Attendants would see the light and walk right past us. Passengers around us also had this problem and we heard chatter about how the staff was rude and they had received better service on other airlines. The food was not good either. I understand that plane food usually isn't great but after following Etihad on Instagram and reading other things online I expect better, especially on such a long flight. I have had better food and service on one hour flights with other airlines. Also, there is a lack of organization at the airport for this airline. Getting through the gate was a logistical nightmare and the Etihad staff did not communicate effectively with patrons. Everyone was everywhere and did not know what was going on. All in all, poor customer service and poor organization led to a very negative experience flying with Etihad.

### "worst aspect was the food"
Flew Etihad from Perth to Milan via Abu Dhabi. This was easily the worst economy long haul flight that I have experienced despite being on the new Dreamliner. The seats are narrow and the seat pitch is minimal. But the worst aspect was the 'food' being offered. I know thst airline food is notorious but I am not that hard to please. But Etihad have sunk to new low levels of inedible and unappetizing. The so-called breakfast was a soggy little meat pie soaking in potato mash. On the bright side the cabin staff were cheery and did as much as they could with what they had to work with. The second leg of this journey from Abu Dhabi to Milan was with Alitalia and the staff, comfort and catering were excellent in every way. Next time Alitalia all the way or Qatar.

### "second flight was a let down"
Edinburgh to Brisbane via Abu Dhabi. Inconsistent product, the first leg was 9 out of 10, apart from check in being slow and some uninteresting food on board a very obliging and caring crew who looked after the cabin perfectly. Check in was one of those times when 2.5 hours ahead of the flight joining the economy queue would have got you to a check in agent faster than being in the Business queue. Redirected to another agent after about 15 minutes, the delay at the Business Class counter being a complicated upgrade. The lounge at EDI is really poor, you are better going shopping. However on the plane, despite the older cabin, for the most part it was what flying should be where you felt spoilt. Lounge at AUH was quiet and the food was OK, lots of variety and a good bar service. On board the 787 the service to BNE was much poorer, while the crew were pleasant they weren't proactive. No water offered at night, had to ask for salt and pepper and a glass of wine with the meal. The second meal was not offered and had to be requested close to arrival. The food on this flight was of a much lower standard and was overcooked both times and cold the second time. If you asked for two things (e.g. jam and cutlery), the crew member came back with only one of them stating that it was a long flight and they were tired, knowing they had forgotten something. Except for a refresh of bubbly before landing you had to request everything. Tone however was very pleasant and apologetic tone. Wine was really great on both flights and on the second flight I decided to sleep in any case given my fatigue and the lack of attention being paid to passengers. Bags off really fast. Limo at both ends is a wonderful service. Sadly the expectations from the first flight were so high and the second flight was a let down as more of a 4 out of 10.

### "Etihad is feeling the economic pinch"
The flight from Doha to Abu Dhabi was uneventful, everything was smooth, the flight from Abu Dhabi to London showed that Etihad is feeling the economic pinch more than Qatar or Emirates. They did not even give the standard kit offered by every other airline, I have been very loyal with Etihad but it seems they are going to start losing passengers now. Their offers for breakfast were very poor, I choose the pancakes which came very dry without any sauce. The entertainment system was the high point though the choices were limited when compared with the top of the line offered by Qatar or Emirates, the seats were very hard and the fabric coarse. The area where Etihad beats everyone is in their checked baggage policy two pieces 32 kilos each is very generous and with their unbeatable prices you kind of overlook their shortcomings.

### "No smile, no greeting"
Calicut to Abu Dhabi. Aircraft is pretty new and clean. IFE was impressive for a narrow body aircraft even though limited choices. On time departure and arrival. Negatives were completely disinterested crew. No smile, no greeting, we have to suffer stupid advertisement on the In flight screen until they took off which is annoying. No real headsets are given like other carriers. A ear phone will be provided only after take off, don't expect them to answer your call bells they are too busy chit chatting in galley. Toilets were messy. Abu Dhabi airport is a complete mess. It's so congested and no proper seating area. Even at the gate there is huge crowd and there is no separation for one gate to other.

### "irresponsible ground staff"
London to Thiruvananthapuram via Abu Dhabi. Flight from London to Abu Dhabi was late causing a 20 hour delay (as they re-booked us on another flight). Though we reached Abu Dhabi around 1AM, the airline didn't arrange any accommodation or proper food. The staff did not even provide information on what to do. Even after 10 hours of landing, the ground staff did not provide proper assistance or information regardless of multiple requests at the service desk. Good infrastructure, polite flight staff and decent value for money; ruined by irresponsible ground staff.

### "worst post flight feedback experience"
Melbourne to Abu Dhabi with Etihad. Entertainment system not working so my 6 year old had a rough time on a 13 hour flight. The worst part was that upon complaint they were willing to offer my 6 year old another seat and with some stranger completely unsupervised. Probably the worst flight and post flight feedback experience ever. Very poor.

### "service provided is a new low"
Flew Etihad Airways from Bangkok to Abu Dhabi. Swift and efficient check in and boarding at BKK airport. Aircraft the usual 10 seats across very tight and uncomfortable Etihad configuration. I knew what to expect. But the service provided is a new low for Etihad. The food was a tiny portion of dry rice, 4 morsels of chicken, some beans, a tiny inedible muffin, and a few pieces of fruit. Upon arrival after almost 7 hours, a 30 gr. bag of crackers, that's it! I felt like being on a budget carrier. No drinks served in between those 2 "meal services". I arrived AUH hungry and dehydrated. IFE very average. I think I will avoid Etihad in the future. It's not worth the money.

### "a wonderful and obliging crew"
Brisbane to Edinburgh via Abu Dhabi. The first sector Brisbane to Abu Dhabi was significantly better than the connecting flight to Edinburgh, however both were still fine. Check in was reasonable except our seats weren't together and when I asked for a seat map we still ended up being apart. However the crew were happy to help on board. The Air NZ lounge is OK while not the same standard as Etihad lounges but was pleasant enough. The 787 cabin is much nicer that the others in the Etihad fleet that I have travelled on apart from the bed is harder that the older A330. In every other aspect the 787 is a superior product and the high quality of the experience really ramped up once onboard with a wonderful and obliging crew. The food on the first 787 sector was superb, the beef fillet was perfect and the meal service top notch. Wine on both flights were exceptional. The second flight had a less warm and competent crew and the food for the main meal was overcooked and half of it not edible. It was still a pretty comfortable flight overall with the majority of time spent sleeping. Bags were off really quickly and with the free chauffeur waiting we were at our hotel less than an hour after the plane touched down. If the standards of the first sector had continued into the second it would be hard to beat Etihad, they still remain one of my favorite carriers.

### "service is absolutely alarming"
Brisbane to London via Abu Dhabi with Etihad. The staff were serving only bare minimum when they want and when you call them they just turn off the signal and don't come. I had to call them 3 times until they come to ask them for water which they refused to give me explaining that they will start the service shortly. I'm on the medication which makes me extremely thirsty and I have explained it to them after that they luckily brought a bottle of water. I pre-ordered gluten free options and on the flight from London to Melbourne I received GF sandwich (which tasted together with all other food served terrible) but on the way back to London from Brisbane I got an apple. When my boyfriend asked for snacks because I was still hungry the cabin crew asked him "didn't you just had a sandwich? This is unacceptable behaviour from the members of staff and should be dealt with. However taken that we experienced same behaviour on all 4 flights I think it's brand strategy.

### "food quality has dropped big time"
I travelled from JFK to Islamabad and from Islamabad to JFK between February / March 2017. They have start cutting corners. My connection time between flight was around 12 hours approx. They used to take care their customers between connecting flights with some food vouchers. But no more. Their food quality inflight has dropped big time. I suggest to bring your own food if you are traveling on a long haul flight because the food they provide is not enough. Specially if you are traveling with family.

### "excellent food and service"
Brisbane to London via Abu Dhabi. We had excellent food and service  on this trip. The ground and cabin staff were polite, friendly and proactive. Other people have commented on the hardness of the seats but this can be solved by setting the inflatable seat cushions to a softer setting. The lounge in Abu Dhabi was crowded on both visits but the food and beverage selection was very good. The table service in the London lounge was restaurant quality, though terminal 4 is getting tired. My criticism is that the inflight movie selection was limited and that the quality of the steak sandwich varied by sector. The ability to eat your meal on demand is a great feature . Overall, this was one of our best business class experiences.

### "the worst service I have received"
A total of 6 flights booked through Etihad from Manchester to Siem Reap return via Abu Dhabi / Bangkok. On all flights the service was patchy and non consistent you would think they were totally different airlines. Only on the first flight we were given a menu, on one flight we were told chicken or lamb when I asked Chicken or lamb what I was told with rice. No pre dinner drinks round on any flight just a glass of wine with dinner. I have travelled with Emirates and Qatar Airways both economy and business but this was the worst service I have received. The staff looked tired and could be heard talking about the bad working conditions. Some flights we received hot towels some we did not, on two flights the entertainment screen did not work (despite them resetting the system). The worse part of the experience was that I paid for an upgrade for extra legroom seats (£193), when I arrived at the airport I was informed they had no record of this so we were allocated seats at the rear, I double checked this at Abu Dhabi and was told the same. When I arrived home the £193 had been taken out of my bank account, I have since contacted Etihad numerous times by telephone and email and after 1 month I am still awaiting the refund. Terrible service from start to finish.

### "ok for 1 hour 50 mins flight"
Was ok for a 1 hour and 50 mins flight. We were connecting from Abu Dhabi to Riyadh and we found the walk from Terminal 1 to 3 quite long especially when carrying hand luggage. A service for First and Business passengers to connecting terminals should be provided. Was extremely disappointed when we were told to go the waiting First and Business Class bus which was absolutely freezing from the terminal building to the aircraft, I would not be exaggerating if I said it felt like being in a cold storage room. Flight was comfortable and food and drink was nice.

### "Service from boarding was great"
Bangkok to Abu Dhabi. Easy check in and no waiting in lines. Was given the seats reserved during booking. Service from the point of boarding till disembarking was great and so was the food. Was given the option of food after takeoff or later, to which I chose the former option as I planned to sleep. I prefer the Business class seats of the Boeing 777-300 as opposed to the ones in the A330s as they are a little wider and provide more comfort when sleeping.

### "it is no different at all"
❎ Unverified |  Dublin to Brisbane via Abu Dhabi. Thought Etihad would have been a bit different to other airlines as we are led to believe. Wrong, it is no different at all. Check in at Dublin smooth and good also no complaint regarding the cabin crew unfortunately that's where it ends. Food very poor, don't like my hot drinks poured in paper cups. Vegetarian meal ordered only served with main meals all other snacks/ breakfast not provided. A lot of the seat trays need fixing, food trays have no grip. The Boeing 777 looks tired and need replacing.

### "generally quite unhelpful"
London to Perth via Abu Dhabi. Etihad was disappointing for such a large airline with a great reputation. I had expected them to be amazing but have had quite a negative and frustrating experience with them especially when I had an issue with them. Overall experience with the ground staff were that they were nice but didn't go above and beyond to make me feel like a special guest. Cabin staff service was average. While the staff were nice, they seemed only do the bare-minimum. They were slow with my requests and at one point, forgot my request for tea, which after 30 minutes of waiting I had to get up and get my own tea. The airplane was nice and the seats were quite comfortable but the blankets and pillows were mediocre. The blankets were quite thin and flimsy, where I had to have two to feel warm. The meals were served quite often though but they were quite bland and I was generally not impressed with the taste or variety of the meals. While the above experience was not great, what made it worse was my experience with the customer service staff regarding my luggage and I would like to warn people the policies regarding checked-in luggage. I had checked in my luggage (after paying an excess baggage fee of £97.50 for being over the limit, which I accepted) and had expected my luggage to arrive at my destination in the same condition. However, when I received the luggage the handle did not come out anymore and was clearly damaged during the transfer from London to Perth. When I approached the ground staff, they advised me to contact their online customer service regarding the matter but there was nothing they could do at that point. I did contact their Baggage Claim customer service department and received a generic response telling me that their policies state 'they are not responsible for damage to luggage due to wear and tear or damage to handles and wheels' so they asked for my 'kind understanding' to accept that policy but they would gladly write a note to my travel insurer so I could claim through them. I was not pleased with this response because I would be out of pocket again to claim through my insurer and asked to be referred to someone that would be able to deal with me as a person and not reiterate their policies. The response I received was quite antagonising and frustrating, they said they couldn't do anything because 'they couldn't confirm the cause of the alleged damage' and they referred me to another department which after 3 days still have not responded to my query. This ordeal has been over a week and I have been pushed around to different departments and ignored and left with no satisfactory response to my situation. I'm quite disappointed with Etihad's response (or lack of) since other airlines would have quickly resolved this issue without making the customer go around in circles. Etihad has a good reputation but be warned that they do not treat their customers with respect and listen to their situation when things go wrong. They are generally quite unhelpful and will provide generic responses or pull policies on you. For such a big company, I expected some flexibility especially if an irate customer has approached them several times to give them the opportunity to rectify the situation. I would not recommend Etihad, there are other airlines that can provide much more superior service for the same or cheaper price.

### "Food and drink was flawless"
Flew Etihad Airways from Riyadh to Abu Dhabi. Check in and ground staff let this airline down at Riyadh. Staff at check in need to be more courteous and at least smile. They seemed as though they were doing a passengers a huge favour and did not seem to be enjoying their work. Apart from this the aircraft was excellent and had the new Studios which offer more comfort. Food and drink was flawless.

### "average Business class experience"
Flew Etihad Airways from Abu Dhabi to Bangkok Suvarnabhumi. Average Business class experience, compared to other similar airlines in the region. Crew were great in making us feel welcome. Inflight entertainment was mediocre. Depature was on time and arrival early. Full flight with mostly holiday makers. Would fly again.

### "never experienced such uncomfortable seats"
As per many other reviews the seats are terrible, had 22 hours out and over 30 hours back (via Melbourne and Abu Dhabi) and have never experienced such uncomfortable seats. The price is cheap so can excuse the poor meals, inflight service and lack of space but they need to do something about the comfort of the seat itself if they expect you to squeeze yourself in and stay there for such a lengthy journey.

### "Abu Dhabi airport the only downside"
London to Sydney via Abu Dhabi. Seats 20 E/F in the smaller cabin, ideal for couples and separated from the aisle by a small table. The A380 business suite is fantastic, the Boeing 777 just isn't as good. Food was good but not great, as was the IFE. Cabin staff efficient as was check in for each flight. Abu Dhabi airport is the only downside, no problem at 5 in the morning but at midnight getting through security is like a rugby scrum, it's survival of the fittest.

### "economy product is below par"
Sydney to Abu Dhabi. Very poor economy product overall that was destroyed by the new Etihad 'smart seat'. This seat may be smart for reducing costs for the airline but it is like sitting on a wooden bench. Having recently flown Qatar Airways I would say the Etihad economy product is far behind. This seat is totally not suitable for a 14 hour flight and I would challenge the airline CEO to sit in this seat for a long-haul flight to see that it is not fit for purpose. Staff seemed like robots only doing the minimum required. Overall the A380 Etihad economy product is below par and at the bottom end of the market. Would rather use other carriers in the future.

### "service itself was great"
Melbourne to Doha via Abu Dhabi. This flight had lots of changes, costing many thousands of dollars. I had internal Virgin flights in Australia that I paid a lot for (extra) just deleted from the system with internal itinerary changes. I recommend issuing separate tickets if your not 100% on itinerary. The Etihad service itself was great. The A380 is a lonely cabin in business, it's hard to feel special. Etihad seem to have dropped the xlarge and small sizes from the pj range. (it's a shame if you're big like me. Also bring your own headsets,  the fancy magnetic ones on the a380 are starting to fail.

### "incredibly small and tight"
Having recently flown to the UK with Cathay and Emirates, I was hoping that Etihad would compare favorably. The staff at check-in and on the flight were all excellent, but the actual aircraft for both legs of my journey felt incredibly small and tight. I am a tall man (190cms), but the 787-9 was especially small and a struggle to fit my legs into the space provided. When the seat is reclined, the bottom part moves forward which gives me even less room. If the seat in front is reclined, it is very difficult to eat food from my seat tray. This has its advantages as the food is probably the worst I have experienced on a flight. If all the other airlines can provide edible food, there is no excuse for Etihad, especially as it constantly touts itself as a premium airline. I got the very distinct impression that they really do not give 2 thoughts towards economy passengers and its all about the bigger margins in business and 1st class. The Business Manager for Etihad could do themselves a favour by travelling with Emirates in economy and see what can be done for the same price. The 2 airlines are not even close in comparison.

### "generally disinterested, no welcome"
After previously terrible experiences with this airline, I decided to give it another shot on this long haul route from Tokyo to Beirut, via Abu Dhabi. First impression was the absolutely enormous check-in line (which has been the case for every Etihad flight I've taken). It took an hour to get to the ticket counter. For some reason, this is always the case with Etihad-not sure if they are short staffed, have antiquated systems, or just simply do not care about the 95% of passengers who fly economy (of course, there were copious staff for business/first checkin who were doing nothing). Flight was on a new Dreamliner-seats were much tighter than other Dreamliners I've flown with other airlines, but not terrible. Great entertainment system. Mediocre staff, par for the course with Etihad, generally disinterested, no welcome, and terrible food.

### "I will not fly them again"
Sydney to Dublin via Abu Dhabi. There was nothing that led me to believe they are competing with the market leaders. Seat was uncomfortable. No underblanket, no comfy pillow. All you get is a mediocre blanket on a hard bed. On the flight from Abu Dhabi to Dublin which is an overnight flight, no sleeping attire. Food was bland, wines were reasonable. The selection of movies is not great and headphones terrible. Toilets small. I will not fly them again.

### "fare was very reasonable"
❎ Unverified |  Johannesburg to Delhi via Abu Dhabi. The fare was very reasonable, under $500 for Johannesburg to New Delhi and returning from Mumbai. All flights departed on time and landed just before the scheduled arrival time. Abu Dhabi airport was nowhere near as bad as previous reviews. Yes it was busy but then what airport is quiet at 06:00? Security check was no more than 25 minutes in a cattle line. I found the economy seat on the A330 very hard and uncomfortable. The IFE was as good as Emirates, crew were multinational and friendly. The breakfast snack was a joke and they are very stingy when it comes to drinks - all drinks, including water, are served in plastic cups. Crew were nowhere to be seen, except chatting at the back, after the meal was served - to few juice and water rounds. I booked the transit hotel (airside) in Abu Dhabi as our connecting time was 8 hours - well worth the $149 for the room for six hours and an hour in the lounge. Overall I would fly Etihad again, but, only if the price was right.

### "no respect or helpful approach"
Manchester to Sydney via Abu Dhabi. Manchester ground staff were lovely and are not included in this review. Firstly we booked tickets and due to circumstances we wanted to change the name on one of the tickets. Even though myself and my husband paid for these tickets apparently we don't own them, they belong to the person whose name is on the ticket. So now a person who didn't fly or pay for the ticket no owns a free ticket to use for themselves!? No money can ever be returned. We had an accident at the airport which meant that we couldn't fly on our original flight. And we were assured by Etihad Airways management that we would be put on the next possible flight with minimal costs to us. £20-30 max, however the truth is it cost us an additional £1900! Why when the accident which required my 2yr old to be rushed to hospital from the departure lounge! Assurances and results seem to be very different from management at the ground to the sellers on the phone at the head office. On the new flights it seemed completely unorganised and irresponsible that Etihad Airways thought it was perfectly fine for my 2yr old daughter to be sat on her own without myself or my mother who was attending the flight just to help with the children. The ground staff in Manchester worked tirelessly making sure that this was corrected before we boarded. However it seems that Abu Dhabi staff are less interested and treated me with disrespect and disgust. I stood at the gate for over an hour trying to sort out the mistake they had made to be told by their manager that I can either board the flight and have my 2 yr old sat alone or I can stay in Abu Dhabi, my choice. I was also traveling with my 1 yr old son who I bought a seat for as the flight was too long for him to not have his own space. Now I as told that passengers with infants get priority seating i.e. The space and the options of bassinets for baby's which was one of the reasons for booking with Etihad. However I was not given this either other parents were but I wasn't. I boarded the flight to be told on board that my daughter could sit alone and my mother alone elsewhere on the flight and myself to sit with my son on my lap. Without the seat I had paid for him! And this to the staff was completely acceptable and because I was getting increasingly distressed at the prospect of my 1 yr old without his seat or a bassinet and my 2 yr old sat alone for a 14hr flight, they dealt with it by stating my son doesn't have his own seat and that if I didn't calm down I would be escorted off the flight! The air staff took my 4 boarding passes from me and never returned them. An Australian member of ground staff, who treated me very disrespectfully told me as I had no proof of my 4 boarding passes lost by the staff I had no right to the additional seat for my son. If it wasn't for a couple giving up their seats for me and my children I don't think I would have ever taken that flight. We took off with my son without his seat and my daughter sat beside me and with me in an attempt to try and hold down a 1yr old and 2 yr old myself. All in all my family and I paid up to £6k for these flights which I have to say was possibly the worst 32 hours of my life because Etihad Airways have no respect or helpful approach to traveling families in Abu Dhabi. They were awful to deal with and deny that they made mistakes like sitting a 2 yr old on her own! Or giving me a seat which I paid for. Terrible service and never fly with them if you can help it.

### "avoid Etihad Airways"
Munich to Male via Abu Dhabi. I went to the Maldives with my wife. Since this was booked as a package holiday it unfortunately only included economy seats. So we asked the check in agent in Munich for a paid upgrade, which we were granted. I paid the approximately 700 Euro (for one of the four segments) by credit card and was handed over the business class tickets. We went off to do some last minute shopping at Munich airport when about 10 minutes later an public announcement (probably airport-wide, since we were already in the central area) was made that asked us to return to the checkin counter. At the counter we were told by the Etihad "Guest Services Agent" in charge that "unfortunately" our initial tickets were not upgradable and we cannot not keep them (not even by paying more etc.). No choice, no regret, no sorry. While I do understand that there are corporate policies regarding ticket upgrades, the described behaviour (of recalling already issued boarding cards) is unacceptable. It doesn't even make sense from a corporate standpoint since the seats remained empty for the flight. Furthermore our initially reserved economy seats were given to somebody else in the meantime. That also meant that we didn't even receive our pre-ordered special meals. According to the cabin crew member somebody else got it instead. I complained to Etihad about this but got nothing but a dull and worthless standard letter. By no means was this middle eastern hospitality or "five star" service. Two lessons I learned from this experience: Book business class right away and avoid Etihad Airways (not only for the experience described above but also for the horrible and dirty airport in Abu Dhabi which would be another story for itself).

### "I don't recommend it"
Los Angeles to Tehran via Abu Dhabi, the worst international flight I've had. Even though I had an economy ticket, for such a long distance, I expected a slightly more comfortable travel. Everything was at its very basic: narrow, cramped seats, low-quality food, broken headset. The amount of money charged for the extra luggage was too much. I had to pay more than 300 dollars at the airport. Moreover, it was my first flight experience where I was allowed to have 7 kg cabin bag with me and not more (it is usually from 8 to 10 kg). This also caused me trouble. All in all, this will be my last experience of travel with Etihad Airways and I don't recommend it to anyone else.

### "last time with Etihad Airways"
Abu Dhabi to Munich. Extremely disappointed in Etihad Airways and Abu Dhabi international airport facilities. More than 30min queuing at the online check-in counter. Etihad customer service is less than useless, penalties to change travel dates costed me the same price as I initially paid, after raising a complaint on Etihad's Facebook page I received the answer 'you can call customer service if you want to complain about any issue' though I was complaining about their customer service. Aircraft to travel to Munich is very old. We are not allowed to use the entertainment services until take off despite the delay in departing. Etihad travel mall for bus shuttle from Dubai to Abu Dhabi does not pick up phone calls outside of working hours (though buses are departing at any time). I use Emirates or Qatar Airways for all my trips and never faced so many negative points even when travelling to developing countries. First and last time with Etihad Airways.

### "crew cordial and professional"
New York-JFK to Abu Dhabi with Etihad Airways. The aircraft was very cramped compared to the A380 I had travelled inbound to JFK. The flight was completely full, which will hopefully encourage Etihad to operate their A380 or Boeing 787-9 on the second flight to JFK as well. We were served food thrice on this flight and the pre-booking option for the meal allowed passengers to choose from a huge variety. IFE system was decent and had a good variety of TV shows and movies to choose from. The flight was delayed for reasons we weren’t made aware of. The check-in was smooth and cabin crew was able to get the passengers settled quickly and minimize the delay. The cabin crew was cordial and professional for this flight.

### "won't be flying with them again"
Manchester to Bangkok via Abu Dhabi. After flying with this airline in the past both business and economy I vowed never to fly them again. However, as I was looking for a cheap flight back to Thailand after a trip to the UK for a family bereavement I went for the cheapest one-way and they were the cheapest at the time of looking. In Manchester, at the check-in which was in itself an ordeal, I arrived 3.5 hours before departure only to be in a huge queue that stretched back around coffee machines and public toilets due to lack of space. This was because only 3 check in desks were supplied for economy, the rest were for online check in. In other words, don't check in online and you will be treated to being tended to last and at the back of the queue. I wouldn't have minded but those who took a chance and went to the online check in were still seen to despite not having checked in online, which resulted in chaos for the rest of us who tried to go by the rules. Then, I had to put my hand luggage into this metal cage to check for size. My hand case was 3kg under the 7kg allowance, but wouldn't go in this metal cage lengthways as it was 2cm too long. They then informed me that to take my hand case onboard, I would be required to cough up GBP155. Due to my wife's quick thinking, as the case wasn't new, we discarded it and put the contents into plastic bags. With reluctance, they agreed this was ok so I lost my case yet didn't give them the satisfaction of stripping me of GBP155. After trying to recover from the stressful check-in, once on the aircraft, we had to sit for 1.5 hours due to the usual delays. Then, chaos ensued at Abu Dhabi transit. Hundreds of people fighting to get through with no organization and a gate area so small that everyone was queuing for what seemed like miles outside the gate area. To be fair, the crew on both legs were attentive and very good and no complaints with regard to them. Etihad are a disgrace and I won't be flying with them again!

### "same double standard is felt"
Trivandrum to Abu Dhabi. Almost all the time, the flights to Trivandrum are the old ones, while the flights to Kochin are better or newer versions. This happens every single time. People pay the same amount of money but get different service. The flight was a safe ride, but they missed serving me a meal and I had to request one. The inflight entertainment system needs to be updated since its an older version and cannot handle the new E-Box version. The cabin crew seems not too much interested to respond to requests. The economy class did not have a mobile / laptop charges, the same segment flight to Kochin has these amenities. The same double standard is felt in the business class sector. GCC to India flight sector mints money, why not give us a good quality product. Food menu has not changed and for the frequent traveler, this gets very monotonous.

### "shame on you Etihad"
Hong Kong to Milan via Abu Dhabi. Due to an accident occurring to me while on holiday on the Italian seaside, I was not fit for fly and I had to postpone my return home to HK. The person I spoke with over the phone was very clear to emphasize the USD 200 change date fee, however, he didn’t disclose any amount related to “taxes and fares”. He simply dismissed me with the standard statement: “I cannot provide an exact figure at this stage”, which was not true. He could have provide me with a reasonable expected amount by simply check on his computer. As it turns out, Taxes and Fares summed up to an extra USD 392. The total amount I was supposed to pay for one way only, was even greater than the original return ticket! No need to say that I have booked the one way tickets for me and my wife with a better company, Cathay Pacific. Shame on you Etihad, taking an economical advantage over your customer misfortune is really a disgraceful business practice.

### "nobody responded after many follow ups"
Lahore to Chicago via Abu Dhabi with Etihad. First, flight was delayed 8 hours, then they re-routed the flight via Washington and added extra layover with 6 hrs waiting. Customer service is worst I have ever seen. I tried to reach their Chicago office at least 10 times, nobody responded. Food was average. I wrote them email - they replied once, we will investigate. After that nobody responded after many follow ups. I had to pay extra to book my hotel and they also ruined my weekend plans.

### "lacking a little care and warmth"
Mumbai to Cairo via Abu Dhabi. The planes are latest, the comforts are many, the gizmos are advanced, the staff look sophisticated, yet what is lacking is a little care and warmth. The  A380 packs a lot of people but the service does not commensurate. For nearly 45 minutes services does not start and once the stewards come to your seat after a long wait you ask for as simple thing as a Ginger Ale for myself and my wife and they just give one saying that there is no stock. Also if you have a connecting flight there is no one at the airport to guide. The A380 Mumbai to Abu Dhabi flight on 20th January was bit delayed and by the time it arrived the boarding time for the connecting flight to Cairo already started. Given my experience with other airlines, I was hoping there would be someone after we come out from the flight to guide us to catch the connecting flight which might have aleady commenced boarding. There was none, the security is so crowded. I seek a help of one of the airport guys saying that I need help to reach the gate quickly to which he asks someone to help only to find that guy is busy over speaking on his mobile. Seeing that, the airline staff guides us to go through a lane that could clear the security fast and it was such a haste and hurry in the process forgot to pick up a few things that were put to security check. Since many passengers have a connecting flight, it is important that the airline and airport extend guidance and help instead of leaving them unattended and force them to scramble scurry all by themselves.

### "not fly this horrible airline again"
Toronto to Mumbai via Abu Dhabi. I have travelled several times in the past on Etihad and I always rated it above many other airlines. However, that impression was totally destroyed with just concluded travel in January 2017. Self and my wife booked our tickets 3 months in advance. The airline refuses to pick a seat unless you pay for it, so we allowed the airlines to allocate the seat. We were on a Boeing 777 (Toronto to Abu Dhabi) and quite shocked to see we were right on the tail even though we booked the tickets 3 months in advance. The seat was very narrow and extremely uncomfortable added to that the seat I was sitting was defective - would not move, so I had to travel 12.5 hours in upright position. Added to that, the entertainment unit was flickering non-stop so I could not use the unit as well. The airline requested us to update our profile so that they know our preferences in advance. However, it looks like a gimmick. The menu card was provided on one side but not to us. When the crew came to serve us, they said all that they have was vegetarian and we accepted but the quality was just horrible. Overall, it was horrible experience. Our flight from Abu Dhabi to Mumbai was on A340, the seat was better but service was a stinker. Again, we were seated right at the tail end and they could only serve us vegetarian! On the way back we were on A380 on BOM-AUH. Great experience, the seats were good but again, we were on seats 85E/F - the tail end. They could only serve us Vegetarian but this time we refused to eat. We asked for a glass of water and my wife took a glass of Sprite. Mysteriously, after 3 minutes the waitress comes with non vegetarian food! My question is what is happening with this airline? Are we supposed to fight for our food option? That is it. I have decided not to fly on this horrible airline again. I advise whoever wants to travel on Etihad on economy, think twice. I am sure they pamper Business and First class passengers though they get their cream from Economy.

### "not impressed overall"
Edinburgh to Bahrain via Abu Dhabi. Not impressed overall despite their 5 star reputation. Food was served sparingly and was of poor quality: on outbound flight, a pretty awful breakfast then nothing for 6 hours, at which point a horrible wrap was served. Hard to get alcohol served. Staff not very present or smiling. On flight back, reverse situation: no dinner served (to 'maximise our sleeping time' - yeah, they actually wrote that, considering the opportunities for sleeping in long haul economy), then the same terrible breakfast option. I did manage to get some red wine (served in plastic cup direct from big bottle). I am not impressed and will not seek them out in the future. Also, entertainment system was poor: buggy, bad reaction to pressing, poor selection, fuzzy screen.

### "be ready for a surprise"
Dallas Ft Worth to Abu Dhabi. Absolute chaos at the Etihad check-in counter. Carry-on luggage was being checked for size. Many cabin luggages not passing for being too long for Etihad Airways cabin bag allowance. The bag shop at the gate was packed with Etihad passengers. I too bought a new bag in order to board the flight. So, if you think you are a traveller who never had issues with your American Tourister or other cabin-sized bag, be ready for a surprise.

### "avoid this airline"
Etihad are the worst airline I have encountered. Flew Manchester to Ho Chi Minh via Abu Dhabi. Arrived at Abu Dhabi to be told we had been moved onto a flight 24 hours later, this despite people still boarding the flight we were booked on. Got told to go to the transfer desk, who informed us we would be sent to Bangkok instead and then be given a transfer from there. As we were in time for our original flight I asked to speak to a manager to which I was told that no managers or supervisors work at Abu Dhabi airport. I checked this several times and the woman was insistent this was the case and we had to get on the flight to Bangkok otherwise we would have to stay in the airport for 24 hours. Reluctantly we agreed. The flight to Bangkok was awful. The inflight entertainment system wasn't working. We got given breakfast and then left with the trays for over an hour before they bothered to clear them away. The first drinks were served 4 hours into the flight. At Bangkok we were then put on a Vietnam Airlines flight to Ho Chi Minh. Upon arrival, 3 hours after we should have arrived, we found our bags had been left in Abu Dhabi. Everybody from Etihad had left for the night. We were left without our luggage for over 24 hours. Just the winter clothes we travelled in (not pleasant in 30+degrees). Etihad refused to reimburse us for any essential clothes and toiletries we had to buy as a result. Took over 4 weeks to respond to a complaint. As we got no response we posted our complaint on their Facebook page. After we did so we then found our return seats had been moved from being sat together to being sat apart. I can only advise others to avoid this airline.

### "service was First Class and the food delicious"
I could not fault Etihad Airways in anyway on our flight from London Heathrow to Melbourne via Abu Dhabi. We had superb service at check in in London. The staff solved the problem of my husband not having a visa for Australia with aplomb and speed. We were happy to be informed in advance that our flight was delayed for 3 hours which meant we could leave our home in a leisurely fashion. The Business Class lounges in London and Abu Dhabi were spotless and the spa area in both, were a great place to get a most excellent massage. We were delighted to be upgraded to First Class on the long flight from Abu Dhabi to Melbourne. The service was First Class and the food delicious. Thank you to all those people who made our trip unforgettable

### "stay away from pre-clearance in Abu Dhabi"
Kolkata to San Francisco via Abu Dhabi with Etihad. Did not make the connection in Abu Dhabi because of a minor 30-minute delay departing from Kolkata, and the pre-clearance was already closed for the second leg from Abu Dhabi to San Francisco. The pre-clearance in Abu Dhabi is Etihad's main selling point however, it's actually a huge pain and causes lots of passengers to miss their connecting flights. Etihad automatically rebooked me on a later flight to LAX, then LAX to SFO with American Airlines, adding 10 hours to my original trip. All they did was take my boarding pass to SFO and give me the new boarding passes to SFO via LAX without any explanation. No lounge access or hotel was offered to me. No one was able to tell me if my luggage would follow me, which was really frustrating. Got a middle seat for the Abu Dhabi-Los Angeles which lasted 17 hours. Also, cherry on the cake, the LAX-SFO was cancelled due to "air traffic" and no one told me, so I ended up flying United back home, arriving 13 hours later than originally planned. Finally, my luggage did follow me - surprisingly after so many obstacles. Anyway, easily the worst trip I've ever had. Not flying Etihad ever again, the onboard experience was a 3/5 but the ground experience 1/5. More importantly, just stay away from any pre-clearance in Abu Dhabi, you're likely to miss your connection and waste a huge amount of time as a result.

### "complaints were brushed aside"
Abu Dhabi to Venice with Etihad Airways. Guaranteed flatbed seating on all long haul flights does not apply on this 7 hour plus flight. Complaints via feedback and ground staff were brushed aside. Nobody would accept responsibility. Asked about an upgrade for my son (flying economy) as we were in business class. Was told it was fully booked at check in - it wasn't. Business class luggage came out last in Venice, not first. Phone call to guest services made by my wife was not returned.

### "2.5 hours to serve food and water"
Flew Chicago to Mumbai via Abu Dhabi with Etihad Airways. There was a bit chaos at Chicago while boarding and once we entered the aircraft it took 2.5 hours for the crew to serve food and water. They should take a look into this as there were old travellers and toddlers on this flight. Cabin was good and leg space was ok. Food was some of the worst I have had in my travelling experience. Need to improve vegetarian meals served and the cabin crew needs to be more courteous.

### "Excellent customer service "
Abu Dhabi to Melbourne. Excellent customer service from the cabin crew and comfortable seats. I also flew in December 2016 to Abu Dhabi and I was impressed by the cabin crew. However, in my experience Etihad ground staff at Abu Dhabi displayed relatively poor customer service skills and behaved in an unfriendly manner.

### "the apartment is superb"
London Heathrow - Abu Dhabi - Sydney and return in the First class apartment. The apartment is superb. Much more refined than the Emirates suite, and in a different league from Qantas or BA First. The separate seat and bed set-up is excellent, there's a great feeling of spaciousness, and lots of storage. The vanity unit is a nice touch. The whole thing exudes class. Unfortunately I didn't find the bed desperately comfortable. It is extremely hard, even for someone who likes a firm bed. They need to invest in some thicker mattresses to deal with this as a priority. The shower is good, though not close to the quality of the EK bathrooms. Amenity kits were nothing special and didn't include deodorant. When I used my own, the spray set off the smoke detector and I was interrupted when only half-dressed by three crew members rather aggressively demanding to know if I was having a cigarette while showering. The toilet lighting was very dim on all four sectors which was a bit frustrating. The on board chefs were all exceptional in their attitude, and happy to make bespoke dishes (within reason), the F&B managers more varied and I didn't really see the point of them. Other crew were consistently very good indeed. IFE was ok with a pretty good selection of recent and older films. Transfers in AUH were speedy (though not well signposted) but First Class priority at security was not open. The (shared business and First) lounge at LHR was quite small but ok. Spa treatments for First passengers complimentary. AUH lounge not especially spacious either but with spa where I enjoyed an excellent massage and paid a small amount for a traditional shave (which was superb). A la carte breakfast was very good. SYD business and First lounge pleasant but no spa. Very friendly staff. Flights on time and any issues always explained. One big annoyance - at check in in Sydney I spotted that my confirmed seat had been changed to a much less attractive one. The senior customer service representative couldn’t work out why and after several conversations and calls discovered a couple travelling together wanted to be in adjacent seats, but hadn't reserved ahead. They had persuaded somebody senior, who should have known better, to displace me without asking. I was extremely displeased, not least that the change had been made unilaterally, for non-operational reasons. I had it changed back and received an apology from the agent (though not the person responsible), but it left a sour taste. Overall, however, easily now my favourite first class, and I wouldn't hesitate to fly them again.

### "surly and annoyed looks from cabin crew"
Edinburgh to Muscat via Abu Dhabi. Definite dip in quality over last few years with Etihad. Movie selection really poor - around 30 English movies only. Food poorer quality than I'm used to on long haul flights, and on an 8.5 hour flight we only had a "snack" (inedibly dry cheese roll) then 6 hour gap before breakfast of pasty eggs just before landing. Alcohol service awful. Surly and annoyed looks from cabin crew when we ordered a glass of wine to go with dinner - huge sigh, "well I'll need to get a piece of paper", then long wait until after dinner service finished to bring drinks. I understand it's an Arabic airline but surly attitude from crew unnecessary and Emirates etc much better for this. Cabin horrendously cold - everyone around needed extra blankets. I've never been compelled to write an airline review before but these flights really disappointing.

### "Food and beverage onboard is good"
Melbourne to Edinburgh via Abu Dhabi. Staff are attentive for me. Lounge at Melbourne Airport is superb. I'm a Virgin Australia platinum flyer so I get to use the first class lounge in AUH which is a bonus. For the Edinburgh flight you need to get a bus to the plane which adds time so not ideal. Food and beverage onboard is good with a broad selection and my first choice has always been available. The one beef I do have (and this has happened to me twice now) is that the concept of priority baggage seems to not be a benefit. Twice my bags have been last off which defeats the purpose of being first off the plane. It's a stated benefit so they should make sure they deliver on it. Not exactly the worst thing but it meant I waited 45 mins for my bags. One other thing, still not been credited with status points and I flew three and a half weeks ago.

### "drop in quality of service"
Seoul to Abu Dhabi return with Etihad Airways. Both flights departed on time and arrived earlier than scheduled. Business Class service was okay, but noticing a consistent drop in quality of service and range of food and beverage offerings. I think this is made up for by the pick-up/ drop-off chauffeur service and comfy arrivals lounge (which includes a complimentary shave service).

### "found the food service poor"
Abu Dhabi to Los Angeles. The flat bed seats were comfortable. Inflight entertainment was below average, only paid WiFi was available. I found the food service to be poor in both quantity and quality. The first meal service took place about an hour after take off. After another six or seven hours had passed, I had to ask when the next meal would be served and was told that passengers request on-demand meals in Business class. The second meal was skimpy (I had ordered a vegetarian meal) and there were about 8 hours still remaining in the flight. During this time I had to make do with chips and tea. The flight attendants were friendly when spoken to but were not at all communicative on their own.

### "barely average experience"
Chennai to Abu Dhabi. Check in was smooth at Chennai. Boarding was chaotic with conflicting directions from two Etihad agents who did not seem to get along with each other. At the last minute, Business class passengers were told to wait and economy passengers were allowed to board first. Finally one of the agents relented and we were allowed to board and economy boarding was halted mid way. The seats were comfortable but not flat bed business seats on this 4hr 30mins flight. Food was adequate in quantity and quality. In flight entertainment was ordinary. We landed at one corner of the airport in Abu Dhabi and were taken in buses to the main terminal. Overall a barely average experience with Etihad.

### "wait an additional 6+ hours"
Chennai to Doha via Abu Dhabi. The first leg of the trip was operated by the partner airline Jet Airways. I could not check in online for the entire trip. Only the Abu Dhabi - Doha leg I could get the online boarding pass. At Chennai airport they issued the boarding pass for Chennai to Abu Dhabi only though the baggage was tagged to Doha. The flight landed at Abu Dhabi at 20:49. Then they issued the boarding pass for Etihad flight at 0250 the next day. The airline never gave me any options when the delay was intimated more than 16 hours, told lies about my trip at the last moment and made me wait for an additional 6+ hours without compensation.

### "not fly again with Etihad again"
I was travelling from Hyderabad to New York via Abu Dhabi. First of all online check-in was not available. Etihad website keeps throwing error. Customer care representative told in some routes online check-in is not available. While checkin ground staff was very rude. Its common to carry one cabin bag and a small back pack. Then they came up with new rules that back pack must contain laptop, otherwise they won't allow it. We struggled for 30-45 minutes adjusting luggage. I will not fly again with Etihad again.

### "I am very disappointed"
Bangkok to Paris via Abu Dhabi. My first experience with Etihad business class. Lounge in BKK is very badly managed. Few passengers but no table available because full of rubbish and not cleaned. AUH lounge in T3 was full and had to wait 10 mins to get a seat. For return flight the lounge in CDG was very good with great service. On board I did not get a welcome drink or hot towel when boarded the CDG-AUH flight despite the flight being slighty delayed by fog. Flight crew where not caring when calling them thru the "call " button. Flight was late at AUH and no information where given about transfer. Security check crowded and I had to tell the staff I was a business passenger as there was no dedicated line. For AUH-BKK flight, again, no welcome drink or hot towel. After ringing cabin crew with no answer several times I had to stand up and go "disturb" two female cabin crew chatting in the galley to get my welcome drink. The plane config was old with very tiny business class sleeper seats, no space for personal items to put even a newspaper or glasses. The only good thing on this flight was a cabin manager who was very caring and without the good service provided by this person my flight would have been a totally disastrous experience. Thanks god I had this ticket at a discounted price. Will certainly not choose Etihad if i have to pay a full price business class ticket. My business class experience with Thai, Malaysian , Emirates and even SriLankan where better. I must say that I am very disappointed and expected a much better experience regarding Etihad reputation.

### "seats were very uncomfortable"
Washington DC to Karachi via Abu Dhabi. The airline was pretty good with customer service and responding to my questions and whatnot before the flight. Their new Boeing 787-9 is overrated though. The seats were very uncomfortable and the plane didn't have the feel of an international flight. The flight attendants were where travel went downhill. I was sitting near to where the flight attendants sit and the whole time one of them went on about her personal life and affairs. She was talking so loud that people 5 rows ahead of her could hear her conversation. She treated the passengers rudely too by calling them an idiot to other flight attendants, in front of them.

### "not be using them again"
London Heathrow to Abu Dhabi return in business class. I pre booked seats 6 months before my flight, and I even confirmed seats on the outward journey at Heathrow. When we checked in we were given different seats, not together. As I was traveling with a 6 year old this was not acceptable, but I was told cabin crew would look after my child. Once I showed them the email with my original seat and after a lot of standing my ground they finally gave us seats behind and infront of my child - I still couldn't see him but was at least close to him. On boarding I had to deal with an angry passenger who said I had taken his seat, the cabin crew did not assist in anyway, thankfully once I explained we had lost our seats he calmed down. They couldn't explain why they had given my prebooked seats away. The food on board was awful and half way through the flight they ran out of lots of the food - I don't understand how this could happen when the flight had left from Abu Dhabi which is their home, so if anything it should have been better then the flight that left Heathrow. Very disappointed I will not be using them again

### "a truly awful experience"
Perth to Edinburgh via Abu Dhabi. Worst experience ever with an airline. We predominantly had an Eastern European crew who were fundamentally rude and obnoxious for most of the flight. There were numerous issues throughout the flight, with the highlight being when they demanded that my 3 year old daughter (who spilt water on her clothes) put the wet clothes on as it was a Muslim airline, and a nappy was not sufficient. One of the main reasons for going with Etihad Airways in the first place was the support that the in flight nanny is supposed to give, but we never even saw them once. It was a truly awful experience.

### "very disappointing experience"
New York JFK to Abu Dhabi with Etihad Airways. The checkin at JFK was quick although there was a long line. The staff were not friendly, rather cold and arrogant. They lacked enthusiasm on Christmas Day. Food was minimal, food rounds were were minimal , seat comfort was very tight. Upon arrival the security clearance at Abu Dhabi is very chaotic. Overall it was a very disappointing experience with Ethiad. Not 5 star in economy.

### "cabin crew ignored it"
Abu Dhabi to Edinburgh. Pushed back from the stand at exactly the departure time, the safety video started but the bottom of my IFE screen wasn't working so I couldn't read the subtitles at the bottom, pushed the call button to alert the cabin crew and it was ignored durning the "cabin checks". Nobody even looked to see if my seatbelt was fastened, once the crew were realeased to do their duties, I was ignored again so I got up myself and walked to the rear galley to tell the attendant, who said she'd restart my TV to try and sort it. It didn't work and I couldn't use the option bar at the bottom of the screen as it was non existent, fantastic for an 8 hour 35 minutes flight, not. I realise it's not the crews fault but ignoring me and the fact I'd flown from Australia to Abu Dhabi earlier that day really annoyed me. With only 9 spares seats (spread out) on the aircraft I stayed put and slept. In the end we landed with a flight time of 7 hours 50 minutes into Edinburgh, but horrendously had to stop on the taxi way for 45 minutes as Edinburgh airport wasn't ready for our early arrival. We then waited an hour for our bags. On the ground I complained to Etihad and was told regarding the early arrival that it happens everyday and this manager has emailed Etihad over and ever telling that that it's a problem with the airline and the airport and nothing is currently being done about it.

### "not helpful or friendly"
Abu Dhabi to Paris CDG return. I have been flying with Etihad Airways since almost 6 years, but my latest flights decided me to stop it. I had noticed a drop in the service since almost 2 years in economy class. The flight AUH to CDG was with a A340 and I managed to get an exit seat. The breakfast was tasteless and not generous as before. Crews were looking unfriendly and not interested on passengers. My return flight CDG AUH was a real nightmare, my seat was broken and it was a full flight. Crews didn't even care again about passengers. Only the cabin manager was nice and professional. As living in Abu Dhabi, I always wanted to fly Etihad but now it's enough. Crews and ground staff are not helpful or friendly and need to be more trained. I prefer to drive all the way to DXB or make a stop in DOH in order to avoid the poor service of Etihad. Believe me Etihad was one of the best few years ago, I feel so sad to see what it became.

### "exceeded my expectations"
Melbourne to Abu Dhabi. Checked in easily to our flight, boarded on time to the A380. We departed only to reach 10000ft 90 miles out of Melbourne, and then began to circle continually. After about 20 minutes the pilot told us that the aircraft wasn't pressurising and they were going to try a number of different procedures and if they did not work that we'd be dumping all the fuel and returning back to Melbourne. After being in the air for 1 hour 45 minutes we returned to Melbourne and engineers boarded the aircraft to try and rectify the problem, after a very long unimformative 3 hours approx wait on the aircraft we departed again at 0430 instead of the original time of 2250! I'd much rather be on an aircraft that was safe to be onboard and recieve a delay than be on a potentially unsafe one. In the end the flight landed at 1040 instead of 0625, The crew, food, seat and inflight entertainment exceeded my expectations not to mention the nicest toilets onboard any aircraft I've ever been on, I look forward to my next flight with Etihad Airways.

### "Highly disappointed"
Amazing flight from London to Abu Dhabi. But the flight from Abu Dhabi to Mumbai was delayed for over 6 hours due to technical errors. While shifting us to another plane, we had to redo the security check. When we got to the new plane, the crew's shift was over. So we had to wait for another 3 hours within the flight, making it a 6 hour delay. While we waited, they did not even serve food or drinks. Highly disappointed. Never going to travel again with Etihad!

### "IFE leaves a lot to be desired"
Flew Doha to Washington Dulles via AUH. Our first leg though short, but the 4am start was very uncomfortable and made the whole experience exhausting, arriving in Abu Dhabi at 6 am is like walking right into the rush hour so getting the Business Class lounge was very welcome. The six senses spa there was amazing as it was superb, the pre clearance facility at AUH was nice and friendly and the state of the art 787-9 was very quiet and with great tail winds saved us an hour and a half so we got in with a lot of time saved. The service was excellent, but the IFE leaves a lot to be desired. Etihad cannot compete with Emirates or Qatar in that department, the food selection was good I took their Indian Paneer Biryani which was good but my exhaustion for not sleeping the whole night and and the long wait at AUH did not let me enjoy the meal. The seats on the 787-9 are very hard which takes away from their comfort.

### "superb onboard service"
Wonderful service at check in and their Business Class lounge at JFK was one of the best I have ever visited. If there is anything to criticize Etihad on it is their onboard entertainment, it is badly lacking compared to the competition. The food choices were nice, I took the steak which was juicy and tasty, the seats were better than the 787-9. Traveling back from the states is always difficult especially with losing so many hours, but wonderful tail winds and Etihad's superb onboard service made the trip smooth.

### "far from a premium experience"
Economy class on Etihad is far from a premium experience, certainly on the shorter routes. A cramped old narrow bodied A320 was deployed on the Cairo-Abu Dhabi sector. I had paid extra for an exit row seat but felt cheated as it only gave me an extra inch or so. Cost cutting was evident as Etihad have cut back on all the touches one would expect from a decent airline. No menu cards, no hot towels or even cold wipes, no blankets, no desert with dinner (only a small low quality chocolate bar). Most of the crew were grumpy, although some passengers did stretch their patience. The 2 cramped toilets at the rear were not in a pleasant state by the end of the flight. Will choose Emirates or Qatar next time.

### "nothing special but offered excellent value"
MAN-GOI via AUH and BLR and BOM and AUH on the return. Overall they were average. Nothing special but offered excellent value as I paid £489 a week in advance. 777 is 3-4-3 config so quite cramped with narrow seats. Crew and food ok. IFE pathetic. AUH-BLR on an A320 for a 3.5 hour flight - food, crew and IFE excellent on this sector. BLR-GOI on a Jet Airways (Etihad partner). GOI-BOM again on Jet Airways. BOM-AUH on the A380 - incredible aircraft in every way. Crew and IFE excellent but food was awful. AUH-MAN on 777 again. Asked 3 times for a soda water and was ignored. Slept for 4.5/7.5 hour flight. Would use again based on cost.

### "entertainment was disappointing"
Manchester to Melbourne via Abu. Dhabi. We paid for the extra legroom seats in economy class and were really glad we did. The seats are only narrow and I am classed as being thin. The entertainment was disappointing as no new films being shown. My console did not work. The food was disgusting and we could not eat it. We ate the bread and buns plus crisps I had taken with me. We felt the flight attendant was rather brusk as she knew we were not happy with food. The second leg from Abu Dhabi was better as we were on a bigger plane. The food was marginally better. Unfortunately now we have got the return journey to look forward to.

### "seat very comfortable"
Very good. Excellent lounge in Dublin and Abu Dhabi. Cabin crew vey attentive. Food choice very good, well presented and very tasy. Really enjoyed both outward and return flights. Seat very comfortable both for sleeping and relaxing. Would fly with them again.

### "definitely fly again with Etihad"
Manila to London via Abu Dhabi. Manila to Abu Dhabi on an A330. Flight seemed about 50% full in economy. Cabin very clean and tidy with a very comfortable seat. Service and food very good. When I came to my seat at the time of boarding there was a medium sized cake box on the empty adjacent seat which I assumed another pax had left with intentions of returning to their seat. When doors were closed, I mentioned to the cabin crew checking seat belts that the box on the seat next to me did not belong to me. They asked passengers nearby and nobody claimed it as theirs. The box was then placed in an overhead locker near the galley area. I was surprised they did not make a cabin announcement requesting ownership prior to departure. The sector to London was on an A380 and the flight seemed full in economy. Seat was comfortable and cabin very clean. Entertainment system excellent with a wide choice of programs on both flights. The economy food on the AUH-LHR sector was not as good as expected from a 5 star airline. Room for improvement on this front. Disembarking at LHR seemed to take a very long time for pax seated to the rear of the aircraft. I guess this is the peril of flying in such a large capacity aircraft. Both flights were good value for money as I booked 6 weeks in advance. Both flights were on schedule so no real complaints and would definitely fly again with Etihad.

### "food wasn't bad"
Chennai to New York via Abu Dhabi. Choose the last row seat for 2 seat configuration and it was a wise move. The smart neck pillow was welcome and amenity bag appreciated. Food wasn't bad, though I wishes I had two full meals on 14hr flight - but it was one full and other was light, with in between ice cream. Seat was comfortable and had good chance to stretch being at the back of the aircraft. FAs were courteous and caring. Inflight entertainment choice wasn't great. For the inflight wifi I paid $20, which otherwise is free on Emirates A380.

### "friendly, helpful and efficient"
Couldn't fault Etihad at all. We flew economy from Brisbane to Paris and return via Abu Dhabi, 4 long flights in total. The checking in process was fine and the staff on board were friendly, helpful and efficient. The meals were also decent, plenty to eat and choose from.

### "flight was only 40% full"
Tokyo Narita to Frankfurt via Abu Dhabi. Depature time 21:25 is perfect, because you have the whole day to go around Tokyo. At the check-in they had some problems with a women at the online check in gate, so they took me to the business class check in. Boarding was no problem and it was very quick. I think this flight was only 40% full. One issue - from row 39-40 the inflight tv were not working,  so was advised to sit some rows in front to see it. I had 2 seats for me, so I had no problem to sleep on the 13 hours journey. The tv was later working, but there were no sound. So I watched on my macbook. Later was a struggle because the tv is very bright and the remote was not working either. For 508 Euro from Frankfurt to Tokyo and back it was very affordable. When I look on a budget and want fly to Asia, I would take Etihad again.

### "economy better than business class"
I began to like Etihad for their price, connectivity, punctuality and seat pitch. I eventually became regular with Etihad and silver class. This time I tried their Business class from Doha to Chennai via Abu Dhabi. I was surprised with the staff attentiveness and availability in business class which was far lower that in economy class staff. During the 4 hrs night flight the cabin became too warm and business class passengers became restless pressing the calling button for help, but in vain - no flight attendants were available for long time. At that point I felt economy class was better than business class for attendees availability and service. On contrary my return flight business class was fantastic.

### "obvious lack of passion"
Manila to Abu Dhabi. I'm a Gold Frequent Flyer member of Etihad and I find this an effective marketing strategy from their end as it encourages me to fly with them more often given the perks (priority boarding, extra luggage allowances and lounge access) even when not flying business class. But the service of the FAs often does not follow the kind of service-oriented profile the airline aims to put forward. I am often tempted to go back to other competing airlines due to this. The FAs projects a feeling of boredom with their jobs and and an obvious lack of passion. In my recent flight for which this review is anchored, service was no more than okay. They followed basic service protocols bu not more than that. It's a culture of service that has to be seriously introduced.

### "I was warmly greeted by an FA"
Flew Incheon to Abu Dhabi. I really enjoyed this flight. Boarding was swift and I was acknowledged as a VA Gold frequent flyer with priority boarding. I was warmly greeted by an FA who acknowledged my frequent flyer status by offering me a welcome drink and available better seat in economy after take-off. These gestures go a long way and I will continue to keep Etihad as my preferred airline of choice. With regards to the meals, I had no issues, although I did skip on breakfast. IFE worked well.

### "did not appreciate the lacklustre service"
Flew from Abu Dhabi to Incheon. First Class on Etihad Airways was an interesting experience. While the seat and meals were good. I did not appreciate the lacklustre service from the flight attendants. They seemed embattled and soulless. Etihad needs to do a better job to incentivize their staff to encourage them to perform better, keep passengers satisfied and build their frequent flyer base. If not, this will ultimately lead to their demise in a currently challenging market that is seeing even the best airlines making huge losses. The dismal service is ironically more apparent on business class and first class flights rather than economy class. Aside from the service, the range of beverages have taken a drastic turn for the worse, with Johnny Walker being left out of the menu and San Pellegrino sparkling water being swapped with a local cheaper brand 'Al Ain' water as part of an obvious budget cut (even on First Class). The food range was alright, particularly, the steak sandwich and poached eggs.

### "it was a pleasant flight"
Jakarta to London Heathrow via Abu Dhabi was relaxing. The crew was amazing and love how they approach passengers. Having a light meal after takeoff was okay, and they serve cup noodle or a kebab as well. I tried the kebab and it taste good. Arriving in Abu Dhabi we were bused from the aircraft. Waiting room was full. Luckily I got an empty seat next to me on the second flight. Slept for 4 hours and enjoyed the lunch and snack on board. Crew was slow to get the request button. But overall it was a pleasant flight with Etihad.

### "service was also below average"
Melbourne to Heathrow via Abu Dhabi with Etihad Airways. First impressions of the plane were terrible. Really dated and I almost couldn't fit down the aisle (I am a size 10 woman) with my handbag it was so narrow. There was no organisation from staff during boarding. Zones were called too close together which caused busy queues and confusion. The flight itself was smooth however the food was absolutely terrible and even my partner who will eat anything could not finish. The service was also below average. There was one notable flight attendant who had a smile on her face. The others were distant, providing no customer service to the passengers, no smiles or anything. They were even leaning over passengers in the middle section of seats to reach another air hostess because they had ran out of items. Too busy talking between themselves to care for the customers. On our second flight from Abu Dhabi to Heathrow we were about to take off and a man stumbled on and plonked himself in the spare seat next to us. He was drunk and I was shocked they would even let him on the flight in his state however I have a feeling the stairs had been taken away and it was more hassle to remove him. As the plane was taking off and accelerating (no exaggeration!) he was falling into the aisle and crawling to the toilet at the bag of the aircraft to be sick. He moved seats several times as he couldn't remember where he was. That was pure luck however the reaction of the staff was terrible. They obviously helped the drunk passenger however no apology was made to us for the inconvenience or the smell. Not a single acknowledgement. We didn't want an upgrade or anything but a simple smile and a sorry would have been nice. I was shocked that for an airline supposedly up there with Emirates this was our experience. I unfortunately booked a return and I am dreading it and I will definitely by taking my own food and snacks.

### "disappointed with service"
Etihad Airways from Abu Dhabi to São Paulo. The economy-class seats are comfortable. However, we were quite disappointed with the on board service. In the Abu Dhabi flight to São Paulo there were 3 options in the dinner menu: lamb with Indian rice, chicken and a choice of pasta (gnocchi). We were in row 24 and when the service reached our seats, there was only the lamb option, all the others were already over. Most of the passengers around us would also like another option, other than the lamb, the only one available. The crew politely told us that due to the profile of the passengers, the menu had been constructed as having lamb as the preferred option. I believe that in flight to Brazil, the menu profile should be improved. Following meals included a frozen chicken sandwich, a pack of sliced apples and a snack of sweet popcorn. Light dinner at the end of the flight had one option only: chicken with penne. There were no small snacks available during a 15 hours flight. The lack of vegetarian options for those on board, came to my attention, since some people in row 23 were out of meals at the final light dinner. Onboard service is incompatible with the company's reputation.

### "cabin crew seemed bored"
We booked an Air Berlin codeshare flight on Etihad Airways from Abu Dhabi to Phuket and it was awful. Legroom was tiny (I am 174cm tall) and it was hardly possible to move. The food was tasteless and dry. Cabin crew seemed bored, not attentive and unfriendly. The inflight entertainment screen was milky and the had the responsiveness of a snail. The return flight wasn't much better either and if Air Berlin wasn't having a codeshare agreement with Etihad Airways, I would probably never fly this airline again.

### "switch to Jet Airways aircraft"
San Francisco to Bangalore via Abu Dhabi. Despite a big announcement that they are no longer using Jet Airways aircraft, apparently during a busy season they frequently switch to Jet Airways aircraft as it is configured for a greater number of economy class passengers which was made clear to me both on board and on the ground in Abu Dhabi. The plane is old, with no inseat power, and is configured in the herringbone pattern which I find claustrophobic and does not allow you to converse with your travelling companion. In addition, Etihad entertainment offering does not compare with that of Singapore, Emirates or Cathay.

### "not worth paying for"
Abu Dhabi to Manchester. A very average business class flight on Etihad. The A330 had a dated look and the business cabin feels cramped when its busy, as was the case on this flight to Manchester. All seats feel narrow but aisle seats are to be avoided as aisles are very narrow and you are likely to bumped by everyone who walks past. The crew were ok, not particularly warm or friendly and there was no personalized greeting from the purser or cabin manager. Food was okay. Better than on the flights to Asia, but with apparent cost cutting from previous standards. The tomato soup tasted like tinned and the beef cheek was ok, but not business class standard. The supposedly "ripe boutique cheeses" were a joke. A wedge of tasteless cheddar and very unripe and flavourless brie. I had a steak sandwich later which was ruined by a huge piece of gristle which I almost choked on. Etihad don't have separate boarding for business class passengers so you have to queue up in the airbridge with everyone else. On a positive note the flight departed on time and arrived early, helped by a heavily padded schedule. In both hard and soft product Etihad lags a long way behind Qatar Airways and Emirates with the food particularly in need of improvement. Not worth paying for unless you can get a free upgrade or use miles.

### "aircraft was outdated"
London to Chennai via Abu Dhabi. The check-in was quick and easy, the cabin crew was friendly. However everything changed on the second leg of the journey from Abu Dhabi to Chennai which was serviced by Jet Airways where the aircraft was outdated and the cabin crew was very unfriendly and often rude with some passengers. The food on this flight was below average.

### "airline is a nightmare"
Delhi to Toronto via Abu Dhabi. This is my first and last flight with Etihad Airways. This airline is a nightmare in terms of food, cabin crew and ground staff. From Toronto to Delhi the flight was delayed for 2.5 hours and on return at Abu Dhabi the flight was delayed for 2 hours without any specific reason. The waiting area was so cold. No water was served and the worst thing it seemed they didn't have any microphone system to announce the delay or share any information with us. The ground staff was rude to the max as they were ignoring all the queries passengers were asking.

### "TV did not work"
Venice to Abu Dhabi. My touch-screen TV did not work (seat 8C), crew rebooted it three times unsuccessfully. Light related to my seat (seat 8C) did not work I spent 6 hours without inflight entertainment and with no chance of reading newspapers and books in a very old narrow body aircraft. A319 is unfit to operate this 6 hour flight leg due the lack of space. Using the toilet is very difficult, as there is only one aisle. Following a written complaint, Etihad gave me a goodwill gesture of 2500 Etihad Guest Miles. I rejected their offensive offer.

### "a real disappointment"
Melbourne to Amman via Abu Dhabi. The service received on Etihad Airways is poor. They changed our ticket on us which meant we lost one day of our honeymoon and they didn't offer any compensation for lost bookings or the fact we had our honeymoon cut short. The airport in Abu Dhabi is awful, tiny with poor facilities and over crowded to the point where you cannot get a seat. Due to the changes of our flight (which was not requested by us) they could not find our tickets and left us waiting at the check in counter for two hours while they tried to figure it out. Flying Etihad was a real disappointment for our honeymoon and I couldn't recommend them to anyone

### "such a disappointment"
Abu Dhabi to Mumbai with Etihad Airways. Such a disappointment especially since I travel a lot with Etihad. Being a gold member and travelling with kids they did not assist me with my seats despite prior booking for them. The kids meals were terrible the bread was so chewy that my kids couldn't eat. The reason was it was not heated. They did not provide blankets when asked at the start of the flight as the crew informed me that the temperature was ok and if I need it later they would give them then. When I asked later, they said they had ran out of blankets. The kids bags that they give were not given to my kids despite being asked several times. Being a frequent traveler, my kids know they get a bag and expect one (spoilt I know). I got the bag only when I purchased a duty free item which when checked the very next day at Yas mall was cheaper. When I contacted the airline all they said was sorry and they will checking with the purchasing team. The ground staff in Abu Dhabi are good. Another issue is with the miles that they conveniently forget to credit and you have to follow up several times. They have no means to escalate further and it's extremely frustrating.

### "never flying with Etihad again"
Singapore to Vienna via Abu Dhabi wit Etihad Airways. For the money they charge, and their constant banging on about 'luxury' and 'premium service', this airline is a total rip off, unprofessional, unfriendly and really worth avoiding. I fly a lot and it takes a lot for me to go out of my way to avoid an airline, but that is absolutely the policy with Etihad now. No company could go further out of its way to breathlessly fawn over its business and first class passengers whilst utterly disregarding its other paying passengers other than to force-feed them constant marketing about how luxurious and amazing Etihad can be, if you're not a pauper in economy. Furthermore, they outsource major parts of long, international flights to low-cost airline partners to save money, meaning that you pay for a supposedly premium airline, but spend over 8 hours of your flight crammed onto a short-haul, low-cost airline plane. This is simply to code share and increase their margins, and is disgraceful. Am never, ever flying with Etihad again.

### "no proper communication on flight delay"
Flight from Bengaluru to Dammam via Abu Dhabi with Etihad Airways. Bengaluru to Abu Dhabi was fantastic but transit to Dammam was not happy at all. No proper communication on why the flight was delayed. When enquiring they simply say wait. There should be proper communication - not good at all.

### "first journey was quite pleasant"
Paris to Delhi via Abu Dhabi. It was my first voyage with Etihad Airways, the first leg of the journey was quite pleasant with good inflight service, average food, attentive air hostesses, they provide cellular network connectivity but it didn't work in my case, although there was paid WiFi connectivity. The second leg of the journey from Abu Dhabi to Delhi was quite unpleasant, airplane was not very clean, flight attendant were just doing their minimal jobs, again average food. A menu was provided to choose meals and drinks, they served all pre-booked meals first then to everybody else, I had pre-booked my meals, I finished my meal before person sitting next to me was served. Be aware if you are being served last, you won't have your choice of meal, as non-veg meals were finished before.

### "worst flight in my life "
Bangkok to Edinburgh via Abu Dhabi. I was subjected to the worst flight in my life from Abu Dhabi to Edinburgh on Thursday 20th October. I asked at the very start of the flight for the freezing cold air conditioning to be lowered as I was very cold - I was told they would do so, yet 15 mins later still the same I asked a further 4 times plus rang the attendant bell 4 times. I should add that not once in the 4 times ringing the attendant's bell did anyone arrive. All I got was an extra blanket and told I could go and try and find another seat which I tried but people by then had taken any spare seats to have extra room. I was very un impressed with the way my request was handled. The food on board was a disgrace and I saw very few people eating what was provided. On my arrival home I noticed my golf carriage bag was damaged beyond repair and I wrote immediately to Etihad and to be fair they did respond very quickly but the outcome was not acceptable. I was offered 15000 quest miles but no compensation for either my golf carriage or suffering during the flight. I was amazed that Etihad were so bad given all their so called awards. I personally would advise anyone to consider another airline given my experience

### "reasonably comfortable seats"
Manchester to Mumbai via Abu Dhabi with Etihad Airways. Check in was smooth. The staff at the counter helpful. Boarding on time. Reasonably comfortable seats in economy. Dinner was served which was average. Nothing special to talk about. Flight arrived before time. Had to take a bus to the airpiort at Abu Dhabi. Was chaotic and had to rush from termianl 1 to terminal 3 to take my connecting flight. On way back, smooth check in again at Mumbai airport. However boarding was very chaotic. They had separate queues for checking into economy (staff did not tell passengers). I was told that I was in the wrong queue whern I reached the front and had to go right back.This had happened to a lot of fellow passengers. Staff were unapologetic. Return flight back home was average. Nothing special.

### "disappointing and unprofessional"
London Heathrow to Abu Dhabi return with Etihad Airways. Very disappointing and unprofessional. We have just returned from a week in Abu Dhabi. This is the first (and last time) we have used this airline. Our six year old son was with us as this was a family holiday. Etihad oversold the flight, so when we arrived 2.5 hours before take-off to find we only had 3 of the 4 seats we had paid for we were a little unhappy. We had pre-reserved seats but as they had also changed the aircraft this reservation didn't stand. The manner in which they dealt with it was appalling. They have a designated "Rebooking Desk" adjacent to the check in at Abu Dhabi which may suggest they do this a lot? Their response (including their senior supervisor) was "sorry there aren't enough seats". I’ve never posted a poor review before. In fact I've just left the Westin Abu Dhabi a 5 star review as they were superb. Etihad unfortunately are at the other end of the scale. They are so much smaller than Emirates (who we've flown with 40+ times) so don't have many flights operating. They said "we are confident we can get you on the 2.30am flight". Not ideal to hang around the airport for 14 hours then fly all night with a 6 year old. No apology was made. They made no suggestion on how they could resolve the issue or help it was very simply just tough luck. I have experienced overbooking in the US when travelling with work. Quality airlines hold the check in process then ask passengers if they are willing to travel on a later flight or codeshare. Offering upgrades and compensation. Etihad don’t even offer an apology. They won't compensate you (other than a voucher that can only be redeemed with Etihad). If accommodation is needed (as they operate so few flights) they select where you stay - and there are onsite airport hotels which I suspect aren't great so be warned. OK - then on board. The flights were also both awful. Outbound from London they decided to wait 3 hours before serving dinner (we took off at 20.45)! This meant they woke 1/2 of the plane up as they served it at midnight (3am Abu Dhabi time). They then let everyone go back to steep, then 1.5 hours later turned the lights? This was still 2 hours before landing. None of our party of 4 ate the food. It was dreadful. The inflight entertainment is very, very poor compared with leading airlines. There are limited films and many are very old. The children's selection is poor too. I'm unsure why the inflight entertainment doesn't start until 1/2 hour after take-off (once you start cruising) and they turn it off before starting the descent. The two times when you really need something to focus on are take-off & landing. Again other airlines allow this to run for the entire time you are seated. Why can't Etihad? For some reason they have opted to use wider than normal trolleys. The consequence is that if you have an aisle seat in economy you are likely to get hit by the trolley quite often. As they barely fit down the aisle. I was hit 3 times on the return flight. Never did the steward say sorry. This seems to be Etihads policy. As we taxi’d across to the stand at LHR I got a quote for a taxi from Dubai to Abu Dhabi. It’s circa 1 hour drive at £100. Next time we go to Abu Dhabi we will fly into Dubai and get a taxis. Etihad sit somewhere between a budget airline and a leading one for us. Unprofessional, uncaring, poor service, bad value.

### "sub-standard vegetarian meal"
London to Melbourne via Abu Dhabi, and my first time with this overrated airline. I will confine my comments to the Abu Dhabi to Melbourne leg of my journey - 13 horrible hours. This was on the A380. I had an economy seat which was an extremely narrow 3-4-3 configuration. When the seats in front of you recline, there is barely enough room to get in or out of the row - extremely claustrophobic. Also not enough toilets - there was always a queue. I was given the same sub-standard vegetarian meal twice through out the journey. They had a far better vegetarian selection on the main menu which they could have set aside for me. In my opinion, these planes are a step backwards for the travel industry as it takes forever to embark and disembark. Even getting out onto the runway seems to take forever.

### "below my expectation"
My flight from Sydney to London via Abu Dhabi with Etihad Airways was below my expectation. The seat was relatively narrow. To be fair, it was not that bad but it was not great for an 13 to 14 hour flight. Especially compared to my last Europe trip. I flew with Malaysia Airlines previously (A380), the seat was spacious, services were good and foods are great too. Good food and service and inflight entertainment. Not-so-goods - seat was narrow for an 13 to 14 hour flight. I possibly will fly with Emirates, Malaysia Airlines or Singapore Airlines next time (unless Etihad is significantly cheaper).

### "do not believe the hype"
Abu Dhabi to Los Angeles. I am very disappointed with this airline. Flew from Los Angeles to India and now returning. The only reasonable leg so far was Los Angeles to Abu Dhabi, the lounge at LAX was nice. Most of the flights had no walkways. At Abu Dhabi we were parked away from terminal and had a bus drop us at the terminal gate. AUH airport appeared old. The boarding process was shambolic especially the leg to India. Food was barely ok. Security check comming back at AUH was boderline ludicrous. Flew Lufthansa last year on similar route, and overall that was a much better experience. Do not believe the hype of Etihad Airways.

### "been let down by Etihad"
Sydney to London via Abu Dhabi. As a business class passenger I feel I have been let down by Etihad and not received the service which I paid handsomely for. When it comes to lost luggage they simply do not care, and follow procedure. October 21st 2016 Update: Business Class Passenger delayed 25 hours - no apology and no compensation My flight was cancelled due to a technical problem. I arrived at my destination (London) 25 hours late. I am still waiting 8 days later for an apology and compensation. I feel this is unacceptable. Similar opinion? Write a review!

### "not use this airline again"
Abu Dhabi to Frankfurt. Booked and confirmed seat in business class was not more available at check-in procedure. Etihad staff in Abu Dhabi was arrogant and not willing to explain why seat was not available although I got a confirmation before. Business class lounge in Abu Dhabi is terrible. Business lounge staff need to get training how to handle passengers they spend a lot of money for service. Before I started my return flight from Australia to Germany I've had to change my flight data and the departing airport from MEL to SYD, this booking change was not possible over the Etihad website although they are offering "booking change possibility by website". It needed to contact Etihad first by phone to get this change done. This was my first experience with Etihad, I will not use this airline again and cannot recommend it.

### "service was efficient"
Flew Etihad Airways from Bangkok to Abu Dhabi. Check in was smooth in BKK and we were given priority access in immigration and security. Unfortunately EY uses the Louis Tavern lounge and there is not much to speak about this lounge. We boarded and the plane took off on time. Service was efficient and the crew were very nice. We landed ahead of time but had to wait for a long time on the runway as there was no gate available. Worse still our luggage, in spite of having priority tags, were among the last ones to come.

### "meal options were disgusting "
I often fly Ho Chi Minh city to London via Abu Dhabi, and this is the third time on Etihad. Previously the food has been fine but this time the meal provided did not match the menu in any way except the kind of meat it included. I tried 2 meal options and both were disgusting and not at all what you would expect from a quality airline. I spoke to the cabin manager who was very helpful and kind and offered me extra snacks if I wanted. She explained that Etihad had previously had all catering in this route done in Abu Dhabi but they had just started to get it from Saigon. I am a frequent domestic flyer on Vietnam Airlines and the food is nothing special but what was provided to Etihad Airways was so below even Vietnam Airlines standards that I am amazed more people did not complain. Once I switched to the Abu Dhabi to London flight everything was normal and fine again.

### "Very disappointed"
Abu Dhabi to Cairo. As a Etihad gold guest member I was unable to take my daughter into the lounge prior to boarding from Abu Dhabi airport. Although a few weeks earlier I was able to take her into the lounge when flying from Abu Dhabi to Sydney in Sept 2016. Apparently it depends on the mood and the person behind the desk to check you in. My friend who was also a business class passanger and a gold member left the lounge and waited by the gate for over and hour and a half. The lady at the lounge said " oh don't worry it's not a long wait, you'll be boarding soon as you have to take a bus to the aircraft". Very disappointed.

### "quality of service got lower"
Doha to Islamabad via Abu Dhabi. Worst experience this time, its not the 1st time I've been on this airline. Before this I use to enjoy the trip but with the passage of time the quality of service they are providing got lower, especially the quality of meal. At Abu Dhabi airport for connecting flight you always had to cross half of the airport. If you landed at terminal 1, for sure your next flight will be at terminal 3. Completely tiring and disgusting thing.

### "so disappointed in Etihad's service"
Singapore to Rome via Abu Dhabi. This review is not so much about the flight but more about the rudeness and lack of service. As a business class flyer you pay a premium for the little things such as seats, chauffeur pickup and service. Our experience so far has been far from what we thought Etihad would deliver. In Singapore the allocated pickup time for the chauffeur was not suitable so we spent time calling and explaining this and requesting another time. We understood that this had been done and waited the following day for the car, which never arrived as it was not changed as per the conversation we had, so we had to make our own way to the airport. The flight from Singapore to Abu Dhabi was fine but the staff were not friendly. The staff and food from Abu Dhabi to Rome was much better and pleasant. In Venice, we called Etihad to book the chauffeur service and were told it by their staff to call Alitalia as it was a Alitalia flight even though we booked and paid through Etihad, it is an EY flight number, plane and ticket. The care factor of the staff member was zero. We then had to call Alitalia. After four separate conversations and Alitalia confirming the water taxi on a return phone call, we have now been advised by the external company that we have a car booked. We explained it is Venice and we need a water taxi and that this was confirmed by Alitalia staff to be told by the external chauffeur company that we have to pay our own way to a designated meeting place on land to take a car. Numerous emails later and lots of time later, we are now left with no chauffeur service and each company blaming each other. If this is the business class service you get with Etihad then is it any wonder people choose to fly their competitors. We are Platinum and Platinum Plus flyers and travel constantly and wanted to experience Etihad. But we have been so disappointed in Etihad's service and the extra costs we have incurred. When a service is advertised as part of a ticket price and is listed on their and/their partners websites it should be delivered.

### "they just don't smile"
Hong Kong to Munich via Abu Dhabi. Not what I expected. Aircraft was OK, as with most A330's/A340's with 8 seats abreast. Lighting was good, it has different colour of lighting that is dimmed enough to create a lighting environment to sleep, and the other good thing is that the lights are pretty much always dimmed. IFE had good movies, live TV on the HKG legs which was pretty cool. What's really bad about IFE is that it doesn't turn on until like 30 mins after take off, and it shuts down well over 30mins before landing. It's 2016, I thought airlines could manage better. What was also below expectation was the flight attendants. The AUH to MUC leg was the best, I felt like attendants were happy and cheered up, but the others I felt like I shouldn't bother them for anything, they just don't smile. One occasion there was a slight misunderstanding in what drink I wanted - no worries I just asked again, in a friendly way, but the response was "you said you wanted xxx" in a frustrated expression.

### "seats were comfortable "
Return flight from Abu Dhabi to Bangkok. Ground service was great on both flights, we were 4 people and we asked to cheange seats succesfully. Outbound flight was in the morning, I enjoy entertainment and food was good. Return flight was during the night, seats were comfortable and breakfast was good. Cabin staff very friendly. Definitely very good carrier.

### "far too cold on the return flight"
Flew Etihad from Abu Dhabi to Beijing. Yet another bus trip halfway to Liwa to reach the plane on departure from, and return to Abu Dhabi - the latter particularly chaotic. To be fair, as observed previously, all the Middle East airlines love the bus. Notwithstanding, on-time departure and arrival in both directions. Seating in the cheap seats I found to be cramped compared to the Chinese domestic airlines I later experienced, and the 330s are definitely showing their age. I'm not liking Etihad's practice of throwing out my 'special meal' (vegetarian) - which was fine - as if I and others have some form of disease therefore not worthy of a drink with our meal. Qatar arrange to serve special meals with all others so this is purely down to Etihad's idleness. I didn't notice the crew, which is a good thing. Temperature far too cold on the return flight.

### "overall quite a bad experience"
Bangalore to San Francisco via Abu Dhabi. he staff was not at all welcoming and lacked courtesy. The food was okay and they provided the meal selection that I made at the time of booking. The flights were on time. Not many movies of interest to me, and the headphone jack had a problem! So overall quite a bad experience.

### "a very positive experience"
Johannesburg to Frankfurt via Abu Dhabi. The main reason to chose Etihad was the price, and despite the overall longer travelling time (at least 6 hours to FRA) it was worthwhile. The seating in economy class is never great, but Etihad seem to make to make it tolerable. The A330 2-4-2 configuration is pleasant enough if you travel with a partner and manage to get a window an aisle seat. Overall not a bad experience. All flights departed on time and arrived slightly ahead of schedule. Cabin service friendly, efficient, and helpful. Quality of food above average. In flight entertainment offers more than enough options. Overall a very positive experience, and one needs to consider the price of the ticket. For around EUR 500 return you can't expect business class service, and any review must take this into account. Flown business class on Etihad before, and that is a different story altogether (in a positive meaning). Just one negative remark. On the return flight from FRA to JNB we exceeded the luggage weight limit by 1.5 kgs between the two of us (i.e. 750 grams each! ), and the check in clerk forced us to to unpack two books and transfer them to our hand luggage. I agree that there must be a limit, but a little bit of leverage would really be appreciated. On the other side, when you see what some passengers bring on board as hand luggage, you wonder how they got away with that.

### "surprised by such low standard"
Brisbane to Berlin via Abu Dhabi. The flight from Brisbane to Abu Dhabi with Etihad on a Boeing 787, about 13h flight. Very slow ground staff, might not be fault of Etihad but rather BNE airport, average friendliness, no issues with check-in though. Flight crew extremely bored upon boarding, no welcome, etc. I am of average size (1.75m - 75kg) and usually do not complain, but the size of the seating space is a joke for a 13h flight. I did the similar distance from Brisbane to Doha or Dubai, but never felt that locked into a seat. The seat rows are that narrow, that you can't appreciate the decent screen as it is too big for the distance you have. So watching movies is not really enjoyable. Reclining and sleeping is not really doable. Food quality is definitely not more than average and quantity is not enough. IFE with a big and good screen, average selection of movies. Wifi OK. Crew were bored and not particularly helpful, poured beer over my pants and instead of saying sorry I was explained why it happened. Toilet cleanliness for the amount of passengers quite good. Safety very good. Abu Dhabi to Berlin operated by AirBerlin on an A330, about 6h flight. Seating with more space than on the 13hr flight with Etihad and quite comfortable. Food was more and at least the same quality than on the 13h flight with Etihad. A bottle of water handed out right at the beginning, that should also be standard on a flight >10h! IFE was average, not much options, Wifi OK. Toilet cleanliness for the amount of passengers quite good. Safety very good. Overall never been that negatively surprised by such a low standard, especially of a carrier like Etihad. It clearly shows that all effort is spent on Business and First class. Ticket price was quite competitive though. Definitely do not recommend Etihad on this flight in Economy but recommend AirBerlin for this flight in Economy.

### "one should look for upgrades"
After a horrible flight with Etihad in Economy from Brisbane to Abu Dhabi I decided to upgrade on the return flight. The money is well spent and the difference is amazing. Had to get my boarding pass printed at the Airport in Abu Dhabi. I was initially told that they can see my upgrade and also that payment was received but they would be unable to print my boarding pass. What?? I was told to call the call center. Thus I got a bit loud and eventually they did the calls and I got my boarding pass printed. Not the very best ground staff service, but at least my request was done in time. Service onboard with very attentive staff with any kind of request throughout the flight. Seat with good privacy. Lots of storage space and tables to eat or work. Seat can be converted into a flat bed, mattress provided, very soft and comfortable blanket and nice pillow. Provided pyjamas and toiletry quite good. Distance to screen perfect to watch movies in a relaxed upright or reclined position. Food of excellent quality and good selection of a la carte dishes as well as snacks. Good selection of drinks. IFE with average selection of movies. Quite good selection of music. Wifi OK. Cleanliness very good and safety very good. Overall the difference between Economy and Business is like day and night. Whereas I would not recommend Etihad on my flight in Economy I do recommend it in Business class. Etihad Business class is very expensive compared to other carriers and one should look for upgrades rather then directly booking Business.

### "Will continue flying Etihad"
Brisbane to Paris return via Abu Dhabi in economy class of the Boeing 787 . The economy seating in the Boeing 787 felt very cramped compared to Boeing 777. Earthy tones are a great look and ambience, however does make it seem a little squishy, especially on a long haul night flight. Food was of a high standard (and my special request meal was never forgotten). Enough room to stretch out over four seats on the flight from AUH-CDG. Pleasant cabin crew on all legs of the journey. Great in light entertainment. Long (and somewhat unorganised) process to clear border security in Abu Dhabi when getting to connecting flight. Will continue flying Etihad on future holidays to Europe based on condition of the plane, attention to detail from flight attendants and overall satisfaction with value for money.

### "thanks Etihad - not impressed"
Riyadh to London Heathrow via Abu Dhabi. First leg of the journey was with FlyNas (Riyadh to Abu Dhabi) chartered by Etihad which arrived 50 minutes late and resulted in me missing the second leg to London, I was forced to wait in the airport for nearly 5 hours for an issue that was not my own. I arranged to sit at the front of the economy section / took no 'hold' luggage and arrived at the airport in Riyadh 3 hours early all just to be on the safe side. The irony is that the initial delay in Riyadh was down to a passenger clearing security! Selling flights to London with a 1hr transfer time at Abu Dhabi is nothing short of irresponsible, and it’s the passenger who has to suffer. The transfer desk in Abu Dhabi was appalling with a scripted comment and a voucher to stay in a hotel which when you consider the transfer to the hotel and back and the need to attend the airport two hours before takeoff, the whole thing was nothing short of a waste of time. The return trip from Heathrow to Abu Dhabi was marginally better although late again. Where I and fellow travelers were expected to run through the terminal, scan our bags at the security point and join the bus for the plane connection with just 5 minutes to spare - do Etihad really expect their customers to worry whether they will arrive on the date or somewhere near the time printed on the ticket, experience the added anxiety of wondering whether their late arrival flight will make the stand in time for a sprint to the aircraft or suffer the indignation let alone the sheer inconvenience of a significant wait. Direct flights only people or you may get burnt - you have been warned. Thanks Etihad - not impressed.

### "studio seating is fantastic"
Bangkok to London return via Abu Dhabi. I'm a platinum member with Etihad. I will say that the use of the Louis Tavern Lounge in Bangkok for premium passengers is a disgrace and I now arrive at check-in at the last possible minute because it's not worth the walk for some stale sandwiches. Bangkok to Abu Dhabi on 777 with warm welcome from cabin manager and food from the set menu or all day dining menu. Flight was on time. Food was great and we were seated in the middle section of the cabin. Abu Dhabi to London on the A380, the studio seating is fantastic and slept most of the way with breakfast served 1 hour as requested before arrival. We didn't eat after takeoff as we ate in the lounge before the flight. Fast track service meant I was out of the airport with luggage and in the chauffeur car within 30 minutes. Every time I fly Etihad my luggage is coming off the belt as I arrive. Return was more of the same with no problems and slept from London to Abu Dhabi (A380) since it was the night flight with breakfast before arrival. Flight from Abu Dhabi to Bangkok (777) was great. I had light breakfast after take off and one hour out of Bangkok had the steak sandwich. The cabin crew were poised and bathrooms clean. I've never had a bad flight even when flying economy which I do from time to time when flying with the extended family.

### "I enjoyed the flights"
My return trip from Seoul Incheon to Abu Dhabi was enjoyable. The service on board was consistent with previous flights and the warm greeting and friendly chat with the cabin manager was a nice gesture. The service from ICN to AUH was only breakfast instead of a full meal, unlike the return leg, which meant no dessert. But the All Day dining menu included ice cream as an option. IFE was good but I preferred to take advantage of the lie-flat bed instead and slept during most of the flight. My only gripe was that pajamas weren't provided since the the 10.5hr flight was deemed a 'long haul' and pajamas are only provided on ultra-long haul flights, eg. from AUH to BNE. Nevertheless, I enjoyed the flights and highly recommend the product.

### "a joke of a business class"
Hong Kong to Edinburgh via Abu Dhabi. First time with Etihad and would be my last, only my return flight is with them. An old business class seat on A330 is rubbish. For two entire 8 hour flights I could feel passenger behind me kicking due to seat layout. When I lay flat, person behind has feet next to my head. With feet on ottoman in front, whenever passenger in front moves, I am shaken in my seat. Result was almost no sleep. Seat also barely long enough for me at 6 feet tall. First flight from Hong Kong the cabin crew very cold and uninterested. Second flight AUH-EDI, entire family clearly bumped up from economy replete with crying newborn baby. I was surrounded by them. Man behind me kicked my seat the whole flight, snored loudly and farted repeatedly which continually wafted its way toward me. Baby cried nonstop. Same family also held up the biz class bus to the remotely parked aircraft. Result = Biz pax on the apron waiting in the bus while economy boarded first. And throughout the night the cabin crew checked on me zero times despite clearly being awake. Received one meal of breakfast. No respect for people paying top dollar to fly in comfort by bumping up economy pax. This is a joke of a business class. I am flying the same circus on the return leg next week. After that, never again.

### "entertainment is brilliant"
London to Abu Dhabi return with Etihad. The staff are friendly and worked hard to keep my two children fed throughout the flight. We ordered the asian vegetarian meal which was delicious but my kids found it a little spicy so the crew gave them an alternative which they loved. The entertainment is brilliant and sufficient to pass time. The seat is comfy and you can adjust the lumber support. A380 aircraft was very new and a lot quieter than other aircraft. Also liked the touches like handing out hand towels and small bottles of water before take off.

### "happy to fly on Etihad again"
Singapore to Doha via Abu Dhabi with Etihad Airways. It was nice experiencing Etihad's 787-9. The Business Class layout was much better than other airlines as it gave more privacy, also the IFE offered on this aircraft is much better than the rest of their fleet. The seats are wider but very firm and I could only sleep laying sideways. The cabin service is nice but cannot be compared to Cathay or Singapore or even Garuda and Etihad needs to work on this. The food choice was wide and since I was in the Far East for over a month I choose the Gnnochi to change my palate, but it was an awful choice and I could not even have two mouthfuls. I am not going to blame Etihad for this, as there were safer choices of noodles or biryani but I decided to be adventurous! The flight was short as we had a strong tailwind. Our connection flight was on time and the cabin crew were much better. All our luggage came through safely and I would be happy to fly on Etihad again.

### "food was outstanding"
Melbourne to Paris via Abu Dhabi. Excellent flight and service. Quality of food was outstanding, I don't know how they manage to serve things so fresh and appetising in those tiny little galleys. Seats very comfortable and I managed to sleep 8 hours on first flight, and about 4 hours on the second.

### "arrived SGN with near 24h delay"
Frankfurt to Saigon via Abu Dhabi. At Abu Dhabi when leaving the Bus into the arrival Hall it was so crowded that we could not walk inside. I noticed that it was the queue to security check, it took more than 1h to get through. On arrival to SGN the pilot announced that due to thunderstorm we would need to circle some time before we could land. After a while the pilot made an attempt to land, however aborted it again. Passengers were not informed about following step for 1hr. On the screen we could see that we were flying back, we finally landed in Pattaya airport which is 90 min way. After waiting for 1h on the runway the crew finally informed us that we would need to stay overnight and would continue the following day. I finally arrived in SGN with a near 24h delay. I do have understanding for security of all passengers, I wonder why the pilot took decision of re-routing to another country. I later learned that 10 other planes could not land on time due to weather, but none of them had to re-route. They all landed safely that evening with a slight delay. At the airport the waiting persons were also not informed about this re-routing and were left without any information about this flight. There was not a single word of apology of the pilot nor the crew. On the way back (SGN to FRA) at the check-in counter in Saigon my luggage had a weight of 26kg, 3kg more than allowed. The girl at the check-in insisted that I had to open my luggage, remove 3kg and store in my hand luggage. I tried to explain to the check-in person that it would not make the plane heavier if I repack the 3kg from my check-in luggage to the hand luggage. and since it was rather inconvenient to open the luggage at the check in counter and re-pack all with a long cue behind me, I asked her if she could check-in my luggage with the 26kg. The lady was unfriendly, I understand that she is not Etihad staff, but a hired ground staff from the airport. She finally left me with two options : either repack or go to the other counter to pay 100$+ for the overweight, otherwise she would refuse the check-in for me.

### "the trip was very comfortable"
Hyderabad to Venice via Abu Dhabi. The fares were the most reasonable of all the carriers, 30% or so lesser than Gulf or European rivals. The trip was very comfortable. Hyderabad check-in was super smooth, and as our intended carry-ons were way heavier than the allowed 7 kgs, we checked in all bags. We were concerned about missing baggage as we would leave Venice in 36 hours to go on a cruise, and any missed baggage would probably not make it to us. Thankfully, all bags arrived intact at Venice. The flight to Abu Dhabi was an A320. Seats were standard, entertainment had many options, including fairly recent movies. Kids selection was decent. The food was standard, but service was outstanding, with cabin crew going out of their way to make the kids comfortable. They got some extra goodies. Abu Dhabi was better than the reviews suggest. Only thing was that there really was a long bus drive to terminal 1, and a longish walk - 10-15 minutes to get to terminal 3, including a security check. But if you are okay walking a bit and have atleast an hour and half between flights, you should be ok. The shopping is ok. The main atrium is a bit crowded but the gates had enough seating. We found the toilets free and clean. The Abu Dhabi to Venice flight was comfy as it was practically empty. As a result, adults slept flat on the 4 seats in the middle while the kids slept on the 2 side seats. Very comfortable night, restful sleep. The food was ok. Crew was again very efficient. This was an Alitalia flight under the Etihad flag. Not as much warmth, but polite and efficient. Will fly them again in a heartbeat.

### "disappointing A380 experience with Etihad"
Disappointing A380 experience with Etihad. I had been looking forward to trying their much hyped Business Studio on the A380 from Mumbai to Abu Dhabi. What a let down! The term "studio" is purely marketing hype. The seat is very similar to the Emirates A380 business seat although way too firm and lacking the personal mini bar. The TV screen also seemed a little smaller than Emirates and it just didn't have the same luxury feel. The biggest let down of the flight was the catering. When I saw the menu I thought they had given out the economy class one by mistake. The only starter on offer was a bland fattoush salad and the only dessert a rather tired red velvet cake. There was a choice of 2 mains, a lamb kebab (tasty enough) and a vegetarian curry. Shame on Etihad for serving such a poor business class meal. The other big let down is the on-board lounge, which is basically just a round table next to the galley, seating at most 6 people. Compared to the bar onboard Emirates A380 fleet, this is poor. Very disappointing product compared to Emirates and Qatar Airways, especially in terms of food and beverage. I will avoid in future.

### "cabin attendants were impolite"
Bangalore to New York JFK via Abu Dhabi. This was my first trip on a Middle East airline and I was very disappointed. The business class cabin attendants were impolite and disinterested in serving their premium class passengers. This will be last trip on Etihad Airways.

### "food was superb"
Jakarta to Abu Dhabi with Etihad Airways. Crew were helpful and friendly. The food (mie goreng ayam) was offered for breakfast and it was superb. We got food twice during the 8 hour journey, first we only got a savoury or a vegetarian sandwich. It was also very good. Inflight entertainment was working well, wide selection of films and music, although I couldn't enjoy much of them, because I slept. I cannot write about Wi-Fi, because I did not use it.

### "quality of service was poor"
First time flying with Etihad from Muscat to Bangkok via Abu Dhabi on a round trip with my family. The overall quality of service was poor. The crew on all flights were rude and unfriendly and lacked the professionalism. The worse experience occured during our return flight from Bangkok. As the flight had some technical issues and needed an immediate intervention it took over half an hour for the crew to inform passengers about the delay. The communication got worse beyond that point and we were left on the taxiway for over 1.5 hours. Then mixed communication was shared by the captain announcing passengers to disembark and then ground staff announcing that we are flying. Etihad lacked professionalism in addressing passengers concerns and providing appropriate information.

### "bad experience with Etihad"
Doha to Colombo return via Abu Dhabi. Bad experience with Etihad, poor service from beginning to the end. No priority boarding, food on board was terrible, no space in the overhead compartment to place my carry on bag (I was flying business class). My checked luggage didn't arrive in Doha - it was left in Abu Dhabi.

### "seat is quite comfortable"
The first leg with Etihad Airways from New York to Abu Dhabi was excellent. Their economy smart seat is quite comfortable although I was quite lucky to get an exit row. Its actually by far the most superior economy product I've experienced. The aircraft is beautiful from the inside out with mesmerizing mood lights and brown and beige colors filling the cabin. I was looking forward to trying out their A380 and it didn't disappoint. The IFE on the A380 is fantastic with good responsive touch, nice camera views and a user friendly interface. On the second leg it was a Boeing 777, probably not that fancy as the A380 but was better than a lot of airlines. I do believe the 10 abreast seating gets a bit cramped but on a short haul it was fine with me. In general the crew were quite friendly and the ground staff were efficient both in New York and Abu Dhabi. The food could be improved a lot.

### "stewardess impolite acting and reply"
Seoul Incheon to Abu Dhabi return. Service is low lost style, airfare is full service carrier. When I requested a beer to stewardess she delivered after a while, and Etihad menu book listed a lot of beers but stewardess told me that "our flight has only one type of beer". I was shocked at the stewardess impolite acting and reply. I have thought Etihad airway's service is worst compare to airfare.

### " a perfect business class"
I flew with Etihad Airways from Hong Kong to Milano Malpensa via Abu Dhabi. Seating 7K for both flights on an A330-200. Great cabin service and great quality food (especially on breakfast). Seating was comfortable with spacious leg room and turn into a flat bed during the flight. Very polite and friendly cabin crew. The ground service was not always perfect (no priority boarding in Abu Dhabi) and both airplanes were a bit old for design. It wasn't a luxury flight but a perfect business class.

### "a great set of flights"
Beijing to Abu Dhabi (Return) EY889/EY888. Both going and return flights were very comfortable and smooth. I found the FAs to be both professional and warm. Being acknowledged as a Velocity Gold member of Virgin Australia (Etihad's Partner airline) upon boarding by being offered a welcome drink and having my meal order taken prior to take-off, a nice touch. I found the food to be above average and the seats to be comfortable especially along side the pillows which have the option of being split to reshape as flight pillow. IFE was in the form in-seat touch screen sets that worked well and had a number of the latest movies and tv series. Overall a great set of flights.

### "service was impeccable and friendly"
Frankfurt to Abu Dhabi with Etihad. Feared the worst after reading the reviews here but was pleasantly suprised. As an AB Topbonus Gold entitled to visit the Etihad lounge in FRA, I had a good start. Nice service, friendly staff, good food, not crowded at all. On the aircraft, even economy got an amenity kit (toothbrush, slippers, blanket and travel pillow). Earphones were quite good (no cheap ones). Food was tasty and really OK for aircraft meal. Service was impeccable and friendly all the way through the flight - beverages (alcoholic / non-alcoholic) offered all the time without having me to ask. Only thing to criticise was the IFE. Quite outdated movies. Enjoyed the flight. Would fly them again.

### "service not what it used to be"
Abu Dhabi to Bangkok, and the service was not what it used to be. It was a night flight which left on time but the crew who was attending our section was confused and forgot any requests. There was a lot of turbulence and adequate measures were not being taken to ensure safety of passengers. Even the quality of food was not what Etihad could boast about. Overall very disappointing. Upon arrival there was on sign of any representative of Etihad for the complimentary limousine. We had to search all over the airport till we found someone running to and fro.

### "their level has deteriorated"
Bangkok to Abu Dhabi. This must be one of the worst flights with Etihad. At one time I thought they had succeeded in getting my loyalty as I became a Gold member in a short time. However their level has deteriorated and my feelings are voiced by many others too. The flight was delayed by almost 2 hours and not a word of apology or explanation to the passengers nor any updates. In flight the crew were one of the grumpiest I have seen, especially the chief steward who definitely had forgotten to smile or speak properly leave alone being efficient. Food orders were not taken on time and my child did not even get his order fulfilled. This company had the potential to be a leader in the industry but has slipped so much below the standards of quality service that I will definitely shift my loyalty elsewhere.

### "business class very disappointing"
Flew Cairo to Abu Dhabi. Old, narrow bodied aircraft with uncomfortable seats. For the prices charged, Etihad should at least use decent, comfortable planes on these routes. They promote a luxury experience but this was far from it. The plane was full so economy pax had been upgraded and business was packed. Seat comfortable enough to sit in but lacked good foot and leg support and impossible to sleep in. The champagne was warm and of low quality, wines so-so and the food offering more akin to economy standard, and small portions at that. We did arrive on time and the crew were friendly enough, but Etihad business class is very disappointing on short routes. I will avoid in future.

### "poor quality business class"
Abu Dhabi to Ho Chi Minh City. Poor quality business class. Staff were friendly enough but ground experience at AUH is horrible. They no longer accept E Gate cards, despite the fact that I recently paid 150 dirhams to get one. No alcohol served in the Etihad business lounge as it was Ramadan (Emirates manage to serve it in Dubai) and underwhelming food offerings. The lounge was very crowded at the morning hour. The flight departed late and despite us not arriving in HCMC until after 7pm, we were only served breakfast. How can this be?! The crew seemed embarrassed. There were only 3 of us in business class, so at least the service was reasonable. Nothing useful in the amenity bag. Rip off charge of over $20 to use WIFI (its free on Emirates). Overall the experience was disappointing and I wish I had travelled with Emirates for only a little more.

### "the food in general was the worst"
Bangkok to Rome via Abu Dhabi with Etihad Airways. The staff on the airplane were not friendly and were very forgetful every time I ask for a drink they would forget, the forget to give us bread with our meals and the food in general was the worst airplane food I have experienced, with little to no options to choose from. The also lost our luggage once we arrived in Rome not just 1 bag all 3 bags. The said they found our luggage and it will arrive at 6:55am at the Rome airport and then they will send it to our hotel, however when we contacted them the next morning they had no records of where or when or luggage will arrive and they did care much to tell us anything else in regard to when it will arrive. They gave us a 40 Euro per person allowance to buy clothes and bathroom necessities but if you've ever been to Rome you'd know that everything is expensive. Day 2 and luggage still not arrive so now we have to go shopping for more clothes again.

### "my experience was good"
Manchester to Singapore. The flight was taken on 5 March and my experience was good. The aircraft was clean and feels new. The experience on the Boeing 787 was enjoyable with a quieter cabin compared to most other aircraft. The unique headrest support the head and having socket points at each seat was a nice touch. The food portions were generous and there was sufficient variety. The cabin crew worked hard but I would have appreciated more drink runs throughout the flight.

### "experience not one I wish to repeat"
London to Colombo via Abu Dhabi in Business class. Customer service dreadful. Lounge at Heathrow very pleasant staff very friendly and helpful, food presentation was good. The seat on the A380 was good. Flight crew on the flight from London to Abu Dhabi were friendly however I felt that they needed more, Business class was full I think, 70 people. Before take-off was asked what drink I would like after take-off and want time I would like to eat. The service was very slow. Was not serviced a drink until 90 minutes after take-off and dinner was nearly 2 hours later than the time I requested. What is the point in asking if you can’t supply as requested. Arrived in Colombo but suitcase did not. Etihad had staff milling around with a list of passengers whose cases had not arrived. My name not on list, had to queue to fill in forms, after about an hour I was told my case was still in Abu Dhabi but would be flown out on the afternoon flight and would be delivered late afternoon. Was given a receipt with contact number. Case did not arrive on the Friday evening. The number given was only contactable 8am to 4.30 pm. Saturday office was closed. Tried to contact Etihad offices in Colombo Saturday morning, only open to 12.30 and closed Sunday. No one picked up the phone. The hotel were very kind and said they would try to assist. Finally got a call Saturday evening to say case had arrived at airport. This was delivered early hours of Sunday morning I sent an email complaint to Etihad through their website on the Saturday and to date 10 days later still have not received any response. Only an automated one to say someone would get back to me, sent a chaser email and still no response. On my return complained to check in staff and was passed to a supervisor who said he would ensure I got a response and was given 45 pounds. But still no response It’s clear once you have paid for your ticket they could not give a damn about customer service. I think they must have paid for the 2016 award. The Etihad experience is not one I wish to repeat.

### "inflight customer service very poor"
Sydney to Edinburgh via Abu Dhabi. My bag was lost both ways, it took one week to arrive on my holiday (a two week trip) and on return I have been tracking my luggage for two weeks with no apology, no compensation and no support whatsoever from Etihad. I left on the 1st of July and it is now the 30th - of these 30 days, I have been tracking a lost bag for 22. I paid $2750 for these flights and Etihad completely ruined my trip. The inflight customer service was also very poor. They seem to be very good at looking after first and business class but in economy you feel like a rodent. It's not all bad though if you have booked, the food is very good.

### "cabin staff were very attentive"
Doha to Jakarta via Abu Dhabi. It has been several years since I last flew on Etihad Airways, I believe their luggage transfer facility in Abu Dhabi has been improved, and the free 5 star hotel in Abu Dhabi was a generous gesture. Both aircraft had shown age but seats were comfortable though the 3 o'clock arrival time in Jakarta is a little ill advised as the weather can be tricky at that time of day though it is perfect to connect with Garuda flights within Indonesia which was the case with us. The IFE on Etihad Airways does not compare with Emirates or Qatar Airways who both have a much larger collection, but this does not mean it is lacking or the selection is not up to date - I was comparing them to the best of the best. The food was a very good selection and you set the time and they will deliver the portions are generous too, all cabin staff were very attentive and introduced themselves to the passengers by name and were prompt if called. Though Etihad have their little issues and fall a little short of their major two competitors they are very competitive with their marketing scheme and innovate to cone up with new ideas. Yes they are a solid 4 Star Airline but working towards becoming a 5 Star pretty soon.

### "customer service is so bad"
I took an Etihad flight from New Delhi to New York via Abu Dhabi and Duesseldorf on 23 July. The connecting flight was that of Air Berlin. When I reached New York my bag didn't arrive. In fact there were many people whose baggage didnt reach. The Air Berlin people took our complaint, took phone nos/ email address etc and told us that they will get back to us. They had also given their phone no. Till today (26th July) there is no news of my bag. The phone no that the airline gave us to contact no one picks up the phone. If we call up their other phone nos they say to call the no given to us. Airline people didn't contact us and I really dont know what is happening to my bag. The customer service of this airline is so bad.

### "appeared to differentiate customers"
We flew from Ho Chi Minh City to Frankfurt via Abu Dabi. Our flight from Ho Chi Minh City took off 90 mins later than schedule due to late arrival. Arrived in Abu Dabi around 2am, we missed the flight from Abu Dabi to Frankfurt. Connecting staff in the airport tried to be helpful, but they tell lies in order to get rid of customers. The worst, they appeared to differentiate customers with different passports. For the same connection to Frankfurt, they gave hotel rooms inside airport to passengers with German passports. When it came to our turn, they asked us what are our passport countries, mine is Vietnamese and my husband is Greek. So he said he would give hotel voucher for my husband to stay in a hotel outside of the airport, while giving me a lounge voucher to stay inside. We excused him that we are husband and wife so it's very inconvenient to stay apart. He apologized that he didn't know we are couple! We asked him if he can give us a hotel room inside the airport, he said its already full. My husband asked him since we have to take the train from Frankfurt to go to Berlin, and we may miss it, if he could connect us to fly directly to Berlin instead of Frankfurt. He said there was only one flight per day, which we might have to wait 24 hours, because the flight just left. Later we found there was a flight with Air Berlin (their partner) to fly to Berlin the next morning. I talked with some Vietnamese passengers inside the airport, who were on the same flight with me from Ho Chi Minh City, they connected to fly to Switzerland and other locations. The connecting staff gave them only meal vouchers, not even access to lounge like me. I told them they could ask for lounge or even hotel. But they didn't want. They said they didn't want to bother the staff. Why did we pay the same price for tickets, but received different treatments? It's time to explore new airlines.

### "not choose again for Business"
First time using Etihad Airways, on my trip from Jakarta to Frankfurt via Abu Dhabi. The food offered after departure was a nightmare. No dinner menu in Business class on a nearly 9 hour flight. They offered a steak sandwich which was awful. Hard toasted bread with something between. Not able to serve salmon bagel which was on the breakfast List. Crew was okay. Wine and drinks offered also. Seats are too narrow in my opinion for pleasant Business Class feeling. Flight Entertainment of competitors is better. Will not choose again for Business.

### "like the short stop-over times"
San Francisco to Colombo via Abu Dhabi. I fly this route frequently - typically using Singapore Airlines, Qatar Airways and Emirates This is the first time I flew Etihad. The only complain I have is the food. The quality of food, and the availability of snacks, was very poor. The other airlines I mentioned are all superior. I do like the short stop-over times and I also like the US Customs clearance in Abu Dhabi

### "think there should be wifi free"
Melbourne to Edinburgh via Abu Dhabi. Lounge in Melbourne is fantastic. On arrival you are offered a drink and given a menu. There's table service from there and they call the flight. Onboard all good. Service prompt and food is fine. Easy transfer in Abu Dhabi, no queues but the place was packed. Flight to Edinburgh was fine though breakfast was below average. In Edinburgh all priority bags were off last, from exiting the aircraft to getting bags was 50 mins. Defeats the purpose of getting off the plane first and this is not the first time this has happened. I also think that as a business class flyer there should be some wifi available free. Perhaps 30 mins or so - would be a nice touch.

### "cabin crew were all but invisible"
We travelled using Air France / KLM from Perth via Abu Dhabi and Amsterdam to Toulouse in France. The return journey mirrored the outward trip. The leg between Perth and Abu Dhabi outward and Abu Dhabi to Perth inward was with Etihad Airways who codeshare with KLM / Air France. On the outward bound we chose to have dinner (we took off shortly after 5pm) at 7pm but when the time came we were told that the food had largely run out and all that remained was some soup. This was accepted in our stride as sometimes even with the best of intentions things can go wrong. However the service by Flight Attendants on this leg was very ordinary. On the way return journey (Abu Dhabi to Perth) we came off a KLM Boeing 787 where the service by the Flight Attendants was simply superb and then boarded the Etihad Boeing 787 for the last leg home. The difference in standard of service in the Business Class cabin between KLM and Etihad was like chalk and cheese. The Etihad cabin crew were all but invisible. I finally gave up waiting for a meal to be brought around and went to sleep. Whilst the Etihad aircraft was new, clean and comfortable the standard of the cabin crew was probably the worst I have ever encountered. Where the Flight Attendants managed to hide during the trip is a mystery. To say that Etihad Flight Attendants are not on the same page as Singapore, KLM, Air France, Emirates or Qantas is an understatement.

### "quality of the screen is very poor"
Istanbul Sabiha Gokcen to Abu Dhabi on A320. Cabin crew on this flight was one of the worst I've met. No smiles and it feels like they do not want to be there in the first place. Food is forgettable, the main course is very small in portion and cabin crew rarely distribute water through out the flight. IFE content is good for a narrowbody aircraft but the quality of the screen is very poor. The near empty place and on time departure/arrival were the only positive experience on this flight.

### "dreadful first experience"
I traveled from Karachi to Los Angeles on June 26, 2016 via Etihad and my flight was significantly delayed over 5 hours and this basically caused me to miss a very important meeting. Etihad staff at Abu Dhabi Airport made it worse as they were unable to keep the passengers in the loop of what was happening and the delayed time. Additionally, the baggage claim at the LA airport for Etihad was the worst thing ever. I have not seen such a small belt even for domestic flights and then the belt stopped for like an hour and no body was telling us what was going on. Overall it was a dreadful first experience travelling with Etihad.

### "would fly Etihad again"
Perth to London via Abu Dhabi. Had a great flight on the Boeing 787 and A380. The cabin ambience was very relaxing and food and drinks were good. Only gripe is no airbridge at Abu Dhabi so had to take a bus to the terminal. Have flown Perth to London multiple times but first time on a Middle East carrier and would fly Etihad Airways again.

### "not a family friendly airline"
Traveling with a family of 6 including 1 toddler and 1 baby, our family went through the ordeal of having one of the adults getting left being at Abu Dhabi airport due to the airline over booking the flight - even though all of us were travelling on confirmed tickets. On top of that the ground staff was not accommodating for letting our luggage get checked in at one go. Once in the air (having lost one of the travelling members stranded at the airport) the cabin crew was not well adept for taking care of family requirements and we were often shunned for simple requests like a glass of water. Definitely not a family friendly airline to fly with!

### "probably the worst experience"
I have been traveling Etihad Airways for a long time, and today was probably the worst experience for us - me and my family. Flying from Abu Dhabi to Lahore, the flight was scheduled to leave at 2:10 pm. After checking into the Business Class lounge, we were informed that the flight had been delayed by 3 hours due to "technical issues". Adding to our disappointment, we were further informed about yet another 3 hour delay. After waiting the prescribed time, another delay was announced. It's extremely disappointing that the airline was unable to accommodate us with another plane; considering the airport has multiple planes on standby for other flights.

### "fly again if I have the chance"
Tokyo to Amsterdam via Abu Dhabi, and I had a pleasant experience with Etihad. Great service with more than I've come to expect from an economy class flight. The food was good, the staff seemed happy to help, and the in-flight entertainment was good. I'll fly Etihad again if I have the chance.

### "arriving at Abu Dhabi was a nightmare"
I flew from Lahore to Bangkok via Abu Dhabi on Etihad on 1st July and returned on 10th July 2016. My experience was very average compared to the other middle eastern carriers. The quality of meals was very poor and the seats were not very comfortable. Most of the airlines have a footrest which makes flying less miserable but Etihad didnt have anything like that. Also, the inflight entertainment was outdated and the system was very old. The movies were old and the touch system was non-responsive. Arriving at Abu Dhabi was a nightmare; we were taken on a bus from the plane to the terminal while arriving in Abu-Dhabi. The airline lost my baggage for a day on my return flight which created a lot of inconvenience for me. I am not too sure if I will recommend anyone to travel on Etihad after my experiEnce.

### "flight experience itself was good"
First leg (Singapore to Abu Dhabi) was on the new 787 Dreamliner with the new Business Class Studios. We took the middle seats as we're travelling together, seats are front and back-facing, odd rows are front-facing. Front-facing seats are also set close together, so if you're travelling alone, choose either a single seat or a back-facing seat to avoid sitting too close to a stranger. Seats slid down to a very comfortable bed - some business class seats slide into a somewhat claustrophobic space for your feet, but I didn't feel it with the Business Class Studio. Pillow and comforter were great and I had a good sleep on a 6+ hour flight. Food service was prompt and friendly, attention to detail by the steward/stewardess was very good. Food itself was excellent - had a gnocchi dish that could have been served right out of an Italian restaurant kitchen. The magic kind of ends when you land at Abu Dhabi airport and realise that you are not parked at a gate, and you actually have to go down the portable steps into a bus that drives you for another 15 minutes before pulling up at the terminal. Although we did get a 'business class bus' (complete with leather seats) for one of the legs, it's not a great experience after being on the 787. Next leg was on the A330 on the older Business Class seat. Much narrower seat but can't say that I was a lot less comfortable - obviously if given a choice, I would have picked the 787 Business Class Studio over this seat!). Still had a good sleep and a good breakfast, other than the fact that the plane did not have running water on board (they had bottles of water sitting in the toilets, thankfully the toilet did flush). They couldn't serve hot drinks on board without running water, so everyone had to live with juices and water for breakfast. The Business Class Lounge at Terminal 3 had the spa and shave service - my husband got a hot shave for US$15 and was pleased with the result. I tried to book a spa treatment but they were full for the hour - additionally, they must have removed the 15 minutes complimentary treatment for Business Class passengers (which I had read about prior to our trip) because the notice at the spa only mentioned First Class passengers receiving the complimentary treatment. Having read some horrible reviews of missing/delayed luggage, we're happy our three checked-in bags arrived safely on the way out and on the way back. However, we did experience flight delays on our flights out and back to Singapore - on our flight out from Abu Dhabi, the airport baggage tracking system broke down and all flights were grounded because all baggage couldn't be traced. Flight delayed by about 1.5 hours. On the way back to Singapore from Abu Dhabi, air traffic was apparently too heavy for us to leave on time. Flight delayed by about 1 hour. Overall, enjoyable flights. Would have been even more enjoyable without having to stopover at Abu Dhabi airport, but flight experience itself was good.

### "I would not recommend Etihad"
Brussels to Colombo via Abu Dhabi, terrible flight the cabin is way too hot the seat is really bad compared to Qatar Airways or Emirates. The fact you get a menu and a small amenity kit is pretty nice. The food was really bad, I do not often skip my meal when I fly but somehow Etihad managed to totally put me off by serving the worst meal I've had on an airline. The only good thing about Etihad Airways is that they have IFE on all their planes, even the smaller ones. I would not recommend Etihad even though the flight was cheap.

### "you only get what you pay for"
Twice a year I fly return to Europe from Australia. The fight to Europe was bad and the return worse. Etihad uses Air Berlin for Berlin-Abu Dhabi, which I was dreading, it was okay but 2 hours late. This meant that me and many other passengers connecting to Australian flights were rebooked and Airport hotel overnight was given. The flight from Abu Dhabi to Melbourne was terrible. Very crowded, 60 mins wait for take off, 90 mins later we were offered a drink, i.e. : 2 hrs 30 mins. Then a meal, which was terrible, a mid flight snack which was a soggy bread roll, inedible. Breakfast, no choice as they had run out of choices. I was given a sort of cinnamon bun and some fruit, all was still frozen. Again inedible. I noticed the staff seemed in chaos as they didn't have enough food. Staff were okay, they seemed to have to make the best of things. Arrival was on time even with delays. I have to say my experiences with all the Gulf airlines have not been good and will seriously think only of the Asian Airlines in the future. Yes, Etihad offer cheap fares and you only get what you pay for.

### "do not be misguided"
Flew Etihad Airways from Kathmandu to Abu Dhabi. Check in was swift and the Radisson lounge is acceptable for an airport which is Tribhuvan Itnl. The equipment used was a narrow body so the J class seats were no better than long haul premium economy class. The duration of the flight is 4.45 hrs so a wide body with better seats and F&B service is being missed. Do not be misguided by their adverts on TV , if your journey involves a narrow body the potrayed services shown are simply NA on these.

### "you will get stranded like me"
Zurich to New Delhi via Abu Dhabi. When I checked in at Zurich airport, I was not given my 2nd boarding pass i.e. from Abu Dhabi to New Delhi. On asking I was told you are on priority and will be given the boarding pass at Abu Dhabi airport. This was a bit strange but I left it. On reaching Abu Dhabi airport, I approached the Transfer Desk at the arrivals terminal. I had wait for 15-20 minutes before my turn came. This was as bad as checking in all over again. But had no choice. When I finally reached the counter and presented my papers, I was told that the flight was full and there are no seats. I was surprised. I had a confirmed seat in my hand but no seat. My flight was scheduled to leave Abu Dhabi at 10:00 pm and it was around 7:45 pm. The counter guy made a call and after a long time told me that he can put me on a flight next day after noon at 2:00 pm which was 16 hours after my scheduled flight. When I told him that was too late, he made me wait for more time and finally offered to put me on a flight to Mumbai and then from there to New Delhi - so I would again reach New Delhi late afternoon the next day. This was appalling. In the meantime I realised that all the counters at the transfer desk had the same problem. Etihad had overbooked all flights and passengers were being harassed. People were going to Egypt or Australia or Hyderabad. There were other flights during the night and early morning from Abu Dhabi to New Delhi but Etihad had overbooked all and I could not get a seat on any flight. Finally the counter guy told me that they could not help me and I should go to transfer desk on terminal 1. By this time the airport security area through which I had to pass to go to Terminal 1 had become extremely crowded. There was no air conditioning. No queue and total chaos. With great difficulty, I managed to pass through that and reached the Transfer Desk. The guy at the counter quickly offered me a seat on a 2:55 am flight, a meal voucher and 200$ compensation. I quickly accepted the deal. But now the set in the surprise: 200$ voucher could be used only on Etihad Airways travel. Not much use if I did not spend another 1000$ first to book an Etihad airways ticket. After handing over the above voucher the guy came up with the bomber that there are no seats on the 2:55 am flight and he can only put me on the 2:50 pm flight. This was crazy. Since then I have tried my level best, spoke to the supervisor and Etihad personnel on phone. Everyone promised the best but did not deliver anything. And here I am sitting in the lounge. They haven't even provided me with a hotel voucher so that at least I can get some much needed rest. If this is called first class service than what can be more pathetic is anybody's guess. Anybody planning to travel Etihad - please think twice. It's highly possible that you will get stranded like me.

### "entertainment system broke down"
To begin this review, it must be noted I am a tall guy, measuring in at 202 cm/6ft 8in and 130 kg. Travelling out, comfort: Travelling from Amsterdam to Sydney, with a short lay over in Abu Dhabi, we were on two A340-500's. The leg room wasn't ideal, but it was doable. Service: The servicing staff was ok. Nothing fancy, but okay. At the end of the flight, they offer vouchers for their air-miles service, and it is clear that the stewards/desses are paid extra if they can sign on new people to the air-miles scheme. It was a little intimidating. Travelling home, comfort: Travelling Sydney to Abu Dhabi, we found ourselves once again on an A380-800. The leg room was appalling. My girlfriend at 173 cm was under pressure from the legroom. But there was simply no way for me to fit in those seats. Add to that, that my seat couldn't extend back, which meant I was stuck between the reclined seat in front of me and my own seat. I could literally see the forehead of the guy in front of me. We were told stories of how the legroom on the A380 is larger than normal. But the legroom on the A340 is better by at least 5 cm. During our flight, my entertainment system broke down, and it took 50 minutes to bring it back online, and no one seemed to understand the problem or offer a solution better than "we have to restart the system - we dont know how long it will take". If this didn't make us feel like cattle, the patronising crew, that seemed almost forced to serve us drinks, did. Etihad clearly caters for the wealthy with their first class videos, that everyone gets to see before takeoff. In the end, Etihad made us feel like cattle, like never before. Lucky for us, Singapore Airlines and Qatar Airways are offering enough competition to challenge Etihad.

### "not up to expectation"
Chennai to London via Abu Dhabi with Etihad Airways. Chennai to Abu Dhabi flight was very uncomfortable. Food was served 2 hours from departure. Got very exhausted in this journey. Abu Dhabi to London by A380 was great relief and service by cabin crew was much better. I travel by various airlines and regret to see Etihad Airways not up to expectation of international airlines. We travelled for a meeting next day in London and one of my colleagues baggage did not reach London. It was delivered in Hotel next day .

### "no complaints whatsoever"
My daughter and I flew Johannesburg to Manchester via  Abu Dhabi and everything about our Etihad experience was excellent. Due to harassment from OR Tambo airport police we checked in very late but were warmly welcomed by Etihad staff. The aircraft was clean and very comfortable, cabin crew were attentive and polite, in-flight food delicious and generous and Abu Dhabi airport provided us with all we required including free internet. Our Abu Dhabi - Manchester flight provided the very same levels. Absolutely no complaints whatsoever.

### "perfect from start to finish"
Muscat to London via Abu Dhabi with Etihad. I always fly with Etihad as I find it hard to fault them. The check-in is easy, the lounge is lovely, the service onboard is wonderful and then arrival procedures are always simple. I always travel in Business Class and love the seats and layout on the A380. I was in seat 16F on this occasion as I was travelling with my Mum, who was is 16E. These seats are perfect for people travelling together as you can push the partition down and chat. But if you are travelling on your own, its just as easy to press a button and put the partition up, so you have privacy. Onboard the IFE is great, the large tv is awesome and the choice is superb. So many movies to watch. I also love the fact that you can eat whenever you want. You do not have to wait for the cabin crew to tell you when to eat. The food onboard was impeccable. I had lentil soup and crusty bread, followed by fillet of beef with fondant potato, followed by cheese and biscuits. All washed down with an amaretti. Perfect. Sleep is easy as well, as the fully flat bed is comfy and I was able to get about 3 hours sleep. The cabin crew are lovely. So smiling and friendly and nothing was too much trouble. Always coming to ask if I needed anything or simply if I was ok. The only fly in the ointment I suppose is luggage handling as for the third time in a row, my cases did not make it on the flight from Abu Dhabi back to Muscat. I was however updated regularly as to where they were and they arrived the next day. Wifi can be a bit sketchy at times. I would say that it doesn't work more often than it does work. Other than these things, I cannot find anything bad to say about them. Perfect from start to finish.

### "onboard service is very basic"
Flew Etihad Airways from Sydney to London via Abu Dhabi. Limousine service is impressive, check in and lounge at Sydney is effective and very well organised. Staff at lounge in Sydney are polite and enthusiastic. Seat is comfortable, although a bit hard. Onboard service is very basic. Felt impersonal, very unprofessional manner from crew. Food was basic and was tasteless. Crew were disinterested, felt like I bother them with asking coffee or tea after meals. Transfer at Abu Dhabi was fast. Lounge was impressive, although food selection could be improved.

### "learn some customer service"
Islamabad to Seoul via Abu Dhabi. Layover of 15 hours with no alternate flight available. However, the airline denied the hotel lounge access stating that my Korean route is ineligible for such benefits. However, the staff was unable to provide any written proof of that. A staff at Abu Dhabi transfer desk used unintended sarcasm that I'm wasting their time as I have lots of time to waste (15 hr layover). They should learn some customer service.

### "standards have dropped"
Amsterdam to Bangkok return via Abu Dhabi. Opted for Etihad as it had the best price at the time. We were disappointed with the overall experience. I have flown this airline a few years back and the standards have dropped considerably. The seating was uncomfortable, and the entertainment options in the aircraft were nothing much to write home about. The meal was ordinary compared to other airlines. If Etihad wants to be considered as one of the premium airlines as it claims to be, it needs to improve. The staff were rude to our fellow passengers (for no apparent reason) and very inefficient. Not sure whether I would like to fly them again.

### "great choice in Business"
Great choice in Business, smooth, on time and nice staff. Not sure I would use Etihad with small children or even on Economy with sometimes long hours to wait at Abu Dhabi aiport which can be stressful with long ways to walk to change from one gate to the other and crowded hallways. Boeing 787 on Duesseldorf to Abu Dhabi flight, a brilliant plane with quiet surrounding in Business. Boeing 777 from Abu Dhabi to Singapore, seemed a bit old. On the way from Kuala Lumpur to Abu Dhabi airplane from an Indian carrier Jet Airways was used, with a poor seating setup.

### "very good and comfortable "
Etihad Airways with a very good flight from Amsterdam to Abu Dhabi, and good on flights from Sydney to Rome via Abu Dhabi. Last flight very good and comfortable apart from two points. For the last several hours, at least two of the toilets did not have paper towels. For the last scramble for the toilet before landing, not even tissues were available. I mentioned this to one of the male attendants and he looked alarmed, as if he had not known this. Also, my son requested breakfast in plenty of time before landing and it was delivered to him 50 minutes later. This crew were lacking in attention, onboard flight EY 454 on 2 June 2016, arriving Sydney 3 June 2016.

### "very polite and courteous"
Had a very pleasant flight with Etihad from London Heathrow to Melbourne via Abu Dhabi. The flight attendants were very polite and courteous. We were very happy with the service provided. the only downside was that the quality of the vegetarian meal was not very good. Besides this, no complaints at all about Etihad. Will definitely fly with them again.

### "staff were very friendly"
Flew London Heathrow to Seychelles via Abu Dhabi. Etihad were a great airline to fly with. The first flight from Heathrow had a fault so most of the passengers on that flight had to be booked onto our afternoon flight making our flight about an hour late. Worried I'd miss my connecting flight, Etihad made sure the next flight waited for us and got us to it quickly. The A380 has a lot of legroom and the meals were good, the staff were very friendly and it was the most comfortable flight I had been on so far. Would fly again with them.

### "memorable from beginning to end"
EY 454, Abu Dhabi to Sydney (A380-800) with Etihad Airways. My flight from Abu Dhabi to Sydney was memorable from beginning to end. Following the friendly yet efficient check-in at the T3 First and Business Class departure terminal, I made my way to the recently opened premium lounge which is arguably one of the best business class lounges. Not only does it boast a wide selection of beers, wines and spirits, they also have a barber, masseuse and beautician (complimentary to first class passengers but reasonably priced for others, e.g. Dh90 for a haircut). Upon boarding the aircraft, I was soon welcomed with a champagne and refreshing hot towel. The FA's led by an very experienced F&B Manager ensured my journey was incredibly enjoyable and they gladly responded to my requests no matter the hour. As for the seat and IFE, let’s just say I did not want to leave the aircraft because I was so comfortable! Lastly - I found the inflight wifi which is provided by T-Mobile to be reasonably priced (USD 22 for the entire 14.5hr flight).

### "flights operated by Air Berlin"
We booked an Etihad return ticket and on the way back from Jakarta to Stuttgart via Abu Dhabi our flight from Abu Dhabi (operated by Air Berlin) was canceled. Original arrival time in Stuttgart 7am. We presumed Etihad would change our booking according to the new connection they were selling on the website that day (from Abu Dhabi via Belgrad to Stuttgart, arrival time around 8 am) but in Abu Dhabi they lied to our faces and said there was no such connection. There was a flight departing to Belgrad while we were at the airport! So they booked us on a flight to Berlin but said the flights from Berlin to Stuttgart were already full so we would have to wait 8 hours in Berlin before flying to Stuttgart (arrival time 4.20pm). Etihad wouldn't provide any food vouchers or anything and no food on the last flight from Berlin to Stuttgart (operated by Air Berlin). The Etihad flight from Jakarta to Abu Dhabi wasn't great either, cabin crew seemed to be stressed out and unsmiling. Drinks were hard to come by, food portion size was small and not every option available. They ran out of vegeterian food. When we tried to order a veggie meal online beforehand it didn't work. When we booked we didn't even know that half of the flights would be operated by Air Berlin, because Etihad sells them as Etihad flights. So sad that we went for Etihad as there were other options for the same price when we booked in the first place. Stay away from Etihad and Air Berlin!

### "seats are uncomfortably narrow"
Abu Dhabi to London with Etihad Airways. Immaculate aircraft with clean interior, excellent inflight entertainment and WiFi available. Courteous and efficient cabin staff. Food good with a choice of three main courses, and complimentary drinks. Disappointing seats by long haul economy standards. Ten across (3-4-3) seats are uncomfortably narrow with a very modest seat pitch.. I am six feet tall and my knees pressed into the back of the seat in front throughout the journey. One other weakness, lengthy announcements, for example before take-off and after landing, appeared to be well paced and clear in Arabic; in English they were very staccato to the point of being unintelligible. Similarly, announcements from the flight deck, disappointingly, were often casual-sounding and sometimes inaudible!

### "trip without doubt the worst"
Melbourne to Abu Dhabi. One cannot complain about the service on Etihad Airways as there is none to complain about. This last trip to Abu Dhabi was without doubt the worst. Settled in, had a drink while waiting to take off and gave the chef my meal order. 2 hours from landing and a 13 hour flight, no food, no drinks and even my potato chips were removed from my cabin! I was offered no bedding, and only had a neck cushion and rug which became unbearable. Asked where my meal was and told that nothing could be served as the chef was on his break - thought it was dining on demand? I couldn't have breakfast because I didn't order any! Went to economy looking for food, but it was full. Found a seat at the back of business and sat there for the remaining 2 hours of the flight. I was at least given a pillow and a blanket! Was offered a steak sandwich 1/2 an hour before landing and that was all I got all trip. When I arrived at Abu Dhabi airport, I went to the lounge and refused to leave until management addressed my concerns. After about an hour and a half a manager came and promised me the world of empty promises! Asked my travel agent to book the return flight in Business as First was so bad, only to be told it would cost me $2,000 to downgrade. Email after email was getting me no where, so went on facebook, and Etihad then blocked me and removed my posts.

### "fly Qatar Airways or Emirates "
Chicago to Kochi via Abu Dhabi with Etihad Airways has to be the worst experience I have had. The ground staff in Chicago did not allow to check in both of our carry on's citing the wheels doesn't fit the template provided. I had taken same airways from Cochin to Chicago with the same two bags and did not have a problem. Then how can they deny my bags when I am flying back in the same carrier. The lady in the counter was not even ready to consider our case threatening us that if we don't check in by 1155 flight will go and if we have to take bags we need to pay additional money. There was a delay of more than one hour for take off. The food onboard was horrible with very less choice. For a thirteen hour flight they served a lunch, a bag of pretzels, a bun and a vegetarian light meal with no choices. We did not receive all four bags after reaching Kochi. If they want only first and business class passengers to fly with them then they should stop the economy class. Regarding in-flight entertainment the less said better it is. They need to fly Qatar airways or Emirates to learn what in-flight entertainment is . This will be my last flight with Etihad. The world's worst airlines.

### "what a disappointment"
Melbourne to Rome via Abu Dhabi with Etihad Airways and what a disappointment. I know inflight food can be a difficult but this would have to be my worst experience in 25 years. No drinks served pre dinner, the food was inedible, each meal/snack offered was possibly the worst I have had on a flight. Melbourne-Abu Dhabi Dinner: Pasta and cheese, dry and tasteless, Fresh fruit salad - 2 types of melon, dried piece of chocolate cake. Snack of a rock hard dry muffin. Breakfast, tasteless egg mush, sausage, small piece of tomato. Abu Dhabi to Rome, the breakfast, offered the same, tasteless eggs, chicken sausage. Snack was cold, soggy bread roll with some cheese and tomato. Food service was slack and disinterested. No more Etihad for me in the future.

### "seat could not recline"
Bangkok to Casablanca via Abu Dhabi. My business class flatbed-seat malfunctioned on the flight from BKK to AUH. The seat could not recline and rendering the seat being worse for comfort than an economy seat but cost a lot of money. It felt like sitting in an emergency door exit economy class seat but could not recline. Despite the crew’s attempt to fix the seat before and after the meal they could not fix it. I expected to be offered a different seat or  upgraded to  first class given that all business class seats were not available but nothing was done despite my complaint. Ittook the crew nearly four hours after take off to serve the main course, which was more than half of my flight duration where I had planned to have to a good long hour of sleep after the meal. There are also minor points such as the use of buses to transfer passengers from the gate to the plane in AUH. Whilst I have been offered by the ground team in AUH a compensation of 15,000 Etihad miles, which I did think it was adequate for my troubles. I subsequently made a written complaint to ensure that my inbound leg of the trip would be trouble free, and I had expected to hear further assurance prior to my inbound flights to BKK, (which was a week later), but I received nothing, other than an email that the airline would investigate and get back. The airline did not take my complaint seriously and I could not believe it that I was assigned to the exact same seat with the outbound flight that had the problem on a similar aircraft that I have made a complaint, I was very upset fearing that it might be the exact same aircraft and I had to face the same problem all over again (a good evidence of the airline ignorance to my complaint) and to make it worst, one of my travelling group, had the same issue with her seat that I had on the outbound trip and could not recline at all. Fortunately the crew eventually could fix it. I followed up again a few weeks after the trip. They offered me the total of 20,000 miles which cannot even upgrade me from economy to business class on the same route. I  asked for the equivalent mileages (which might not guarantee that I can upgrade my seat as the mileage upgrade is subject to quota and availability, not to mention that if I choose to use the miles I will have to pay for another flight to the airline that I do not want to fly with again). I wouldn't ask for any complimentary mileage if I had gotten a properly functioning seat that I had paid a lot of money for! It has now been months since my first complaint and I tried to follow up but I just received an email saying that they “hope you will accept the offer we have previously made. We now regard this matter as closed”.

### "very enjoyable experience"
Morning flight from Delhi to Abu Dhabi and then the Etihad bus to Dubai. Overall a very enjoyable experience. Everything went very smoothly from the very quick baggage drop at Delhi through to arriving in Dubai on their bus. At US$ 125 booked direct it was also something of a bargain including checked baggage, a decent meal and free drinks. Seat was reasonably comfortable for a flight of this duration and the in flight entertainment quite comprehensive with plenty of choice. Staff were friendly and helpful. I will certainly fly Etihad again.

### "waiting for any reply"
Bejing to Berlin via Abu Dhabi. Due to technical problems of the Etihad A330 there was a delay of 2 hours, and I missed my connecting flight in Abu Dhabi due to the aforementioned delay. Such things can happen but the way Etihad managed the issue has been not acceptable. Instead of offering me the direct flight to Berlin next day (xl-seat as booked), I got flights via Bucharest and Stuttgart, seated very lousy in the deepest economy class in a very old A320. Instead of support and help in Abu Dhabi I was confronted with unpolite, offensive ground staff telling me lies in order to get rid of me. I am waiting for any reply, statement of Etihad since more than 6 weeks (same story happened two weeks before), respectively 4 weeks now. Miles were not registered, no excuse for 2 days lost due to incedints caused by the airline. No excuse, no reply, no miles. This behaviour is not acceptable and it destroys my trust in the airline.

### "best travel experience "
London to Sydney via Abu Dhabi with Etihad Airways, and this was by far the best travel experience I have had. The limo pick up was excellent, they arranged a convenient time, very polite driver and a great car. The Heathrow Lounge was very well presented with a table service if you wanted to dine, along with roaming staff for drinks or light refreshments. I had a spa treatment which was excellent. Boarding the aircraft was easy and I was welcomed at the door and shown to my apartment. The apartment was out of this world and I was shown all of its features and offered drinks/canapes and a menu. The crew could not do enough for me and this continued for the whole flight. The food was restaurant quality and well presented. Having a shower onboard was an experience, and the toiletries provided were excellent. Would thoroughly recommend Etihad and the flight to Australia was a dream.

### "Boeing 777 uncomfortable"
Abu Dhabi to Bangkok with Etihad Airways. At the time of booking this flight, EY 406 was operated using an A330, which has much better legroom and wider seats than the Boeing 777. Unfortunately, I was advised by email that the route was now operated using a Boeing 777, so I knew this Etihad flight was going to be uncomfortable. What on earth possessed Etihad to squeeze 10 seats across their 777s? Many airlines (Thai, Singapore etc) have 9 across, in a 3-3-3 configuration. The 10th seat on Etihad makes for a very narrow seat indeed. The flight itself was ok. Good meal, IFE had a reasonable selection. This flight was operated using a Jet Airways 777, which has an identical seating configuration to Etihad. Cabin crew helpful and friendly, and especially good with our young daughter who was very tired. If only Etihad didn't have those ridiculously narrow seats. I couldn't imagine flying 13+ hours on this aircraft. 5 hours 45mins was more than enough! I would only recommend flying Etihad if you are 5 feet tall and really really slim.

### "no apology for lack of food"
I had booked Etihad Airways from Manchester to Abu Dhabi flights with my family to visit family. I had booked for the flight at 20.00 hrs to try to make sure the baby with us slept. All was fine until the food was served, none of the family were offered anything they could eat. There was no choice at all, with only one meal being left. The flight was not full and there were empty seats so I would have thought that there would have been some choice of food. An 8 hour flight with nothing to eat is not the best recommendation for the airline. There was no apology for the lack of food only that that the menu said that not all food could be relied on to be available. Not a very satisfactory outcome.

### "delay of more than 19 hours"
Bangkok to Düsseldorf via Abu Dhabi. Due to technical issues the flight had a delay. This was announced on short notice and caused hours of waiting at the check in desks in Bangkok. The alternative flight plan provided by Etihad Airways caused a delay of more than 19 hours. I was till now a satisfied Etihad customer but this delay makes me question whether I book Etihad again in the near future. On the plus side, they provided very good hotel and transportation service - both in Bangkok and in Abu Dhabi.

### "service very good and attentive"
From the lounge at London Heathrow to Bangkok, the service was excellent. Great lounge for breakfast to order, A380 very comfortable, good selection of food and drinks and you can choose what time you want your meal. Service very good and attentive. My wife left a scarf on the aircraft at AUH, we informed the personnel at the B/lounge and it was returned to her just before push off on the next flight. Great service from the staff in the lounge near gate 34. Return flights were just as good, we did worry about luggage after reading other reviews but everything arrived even though we stepped of one flight and got directly on the next.

### "friendly and attentive staff"
Flight from Perth to London via Abu Dhabi with Etihad Airways. Efficient check in at Perth and they use the Qantas lounge which though small was efficient and the staff friendly. A330-200 from Perth was clean and although older business class product, friendly and attentive staff compensated for this. The flexible dining option is a bonus and all food options of good quality and delivered at specified times. They made a real effort to make my son feel welcome. This was all the more impressive given that it was a full flight. A380 from AUH to LHR. One of the main problems with EY11 is it operates at a tiring time of day. Business cabin was clean and well appointed. However, the staff did seem to struggle a bit at times. That said all food options were good. Baggage on belt in under 20 minutes at LHR.

### "seat in A320 is spacious"
Abu Dhabi to Doha, was upgraded to Business class. I was the last passenger to board and was called on my mobile to board the aircraft immediately. The seat in the A320 is spacious and typical to other airlines. The seat reclines to an extent but not to complete comfort. it was late night flight and being a short flight, a snack was served.

### "crew courteous and friendly"
My first flight with Etihad Airways from Chennai to Abu Dhabi. A321 flight pleasantly surprised with the seat and comfort. Cabin crew were courteous and friendly. The choice of meal was great with menu. Bloody mary was served on request. Inflight entertainment on HD screen, the best part is the power socket under each seat.

### "pretty good cabin crew"
Etihad Airways from Abu Dhabi to Dublin. We often choose to fly out of Abu Dhabi rather than Dubai, where we live because EY provide a convenient two way limo service and we find Abu Dhabi Airport less stressful than Dubai. It's usually a B777 which is fine. The flight was fine. Late push back because of arrival scheduling and the usual 1-2-1 offset seating in Business Class. If you are travelling alone it's best to go for the odd numbered rows (5,7,9 etc) which are more private window seats rather than the aisle focused even numbered seats (6,8 etc). Likewise, if you are with a partner and you want to be together, go for the odd row numbered central seats which are actually together. The usual pretty good cabin crew and the Cabin Manager was efficient. The IFE is pretty poor - that's one element that lets them down and the food was a bit cold to the table but maybe that was my fault for asking for a short delay in serving. The onboard phone service was a bit hit and miss as usual. I can't help the impression that the overall product offering in Business Class is not what it used to be, probably to save costs. Poor content but pretty bag amenity kits, no pyjamas, no little flowers in their vases, no cologne in the bathrooms etc. It seems that the intention is to provide a "premium economy" experience rather than a downgraded first class but I suppose that is what happens when an airline starts to cut costs. Arrival in Dublin was 15 minutes late and disembarkation was rapid and via the front door for a change.

### "seat was totally worn out"
Old Plane with lousy seat in business class I flew the first time Etihad from Manila to Abu Dhabi on EY 423. The plane was old and my seat was totally worn out. I was sitting on the frame. Check-in was very good and the crew was very friendly but it took them more two hours to serve dinner.

### "pleasant cabin crew"
London Heathrow to Perth via Abu Dhabi. Prompt and efficient check in at LHR. Excellent lounge offering good quality breakfast at LHR. Good access to SPA and enjoyed pre flight massage. There were enough toys in lounge to entertain my son. Flight from LHR to AUH on upper deck of A380. Food and Beverage manager introduced by name and dining choices taken and delivered on time on a full flight. I very much enjoyed the business seating on the A380. Transiting through AUH was not impressive and their lounge was packed. Flight from AUH to PER on older A330. However, pleasant cabin crew were very attentive. Overall, a positive experience.

### "doubt I will fly Etihad again"
Toronto to Chennai via Abu Dhabi. The seats were good, able to lie flat and sleep. Nice thick blanket and pillow. Amenity kit has gone downhill in the last few years, looks cheap. The zipper on my bag broke, the fabric cover looks like something from a cheap souvenir shop. Service was terrible, indifferent. The crew used the "dine as you like" as an excuse to never come around and check if passengers needed anything. When walking down the aisle, the attendants made sure to avoid eye contact. After I finished eating, the tray stayed with me for 2 hours before being cleared. Would give them zero or negative stars if possible. I doubt I will fly Etihad again.

### "had a great FA from Thailand"
Etihad Airways from Paris to Abu Dhabi. Relatively efficient boarding at Paris CDG. Boeing 777 is well-appointed, only criticism is that my seat needed to be re-furbished. No cushion left. Only flown A340 and A380 with Etihad before and they were better seats. Especially A380. Screen big and great IFE. Pre-flight champagne. Really nice Lamb entree and fantastic presentation. Pretty good wine and excellent beer selection. And, my aisle had a great FA from Thailand - she was doing a lot of the work for others it appeared. Etihad FAs are not the best I've encountered but good overall. Sometimes they seem a little stiff, like afraid to make a mistake. Flight was delayed 40 min because of ATC strike in Paris CDG. Captain was very communicative.

### "lack of empathy and care"
Manchester to Ho Chi Minh City via Abu Dhabi, and I can't begin to understand how Etihad Airways receives customer awards. We flew four journeys and had issues on three of them, having never raised an issue with an airline at all over the past thirty years of flying. I can't get a response from their laughably entitled "Guest Relations Support" department. On the outward first leg my entertainment system didn't work - no great problem, wouldn't complain, brought it to the attention of cabin crew who said they'd reset it but never checked. On the next leg our luggage was left behind at Abu Dhabi - apparently a regular occurrence. I understand that this is an occupational hazard of flying. We had it delivered 24 hours later having been given three different times for its delivery to our private address. On the first leg of the return journey I was trapped in a seat which was unable to recline, causing acute discomfort and backache. This was what prompted me to complain in the first instance. I received a holding reply then a request for further information and now heard nothing for eight days in response to that information being sent. Cabin and ground crew were generally pleasant and reasonably efficient but I agree with others that the meals are pretty poor. I have now abandoned Etihad despite holding their credit cards and having intended to make them my carrier of choice. Very disappointing - most particularly in their absolute lack of empathy and care for their consumers.

### "A380 seats were so narrow"
Hong Kong to London via Abu Dhabi with Etihad Airways/ The initial flight from Hong Kong to Abu Dhabi on the A330 was fine. The seats weren't too bad and the IFE was pretty good. Crew were happy to serve us and food was fine. Transit and AUH was a bit of a schlep from one gate to another. The second flight on the A380 was another story. The seats were so narrow. There was nowhere to put your elbows. I has an isle seat and my elbows were constantly being bumped by crew and passengers. I also noticed how narrow the isles were too. Although the seat was comfortable, the legroom was almost nil and my knees were always up against the seat in front of me making it impossible to get any sleep. Thankfully the IFE was top notch with noise cancelling headphones. Service was fun and the breakfast was quite large. None of that could make up for the cramped seating.

### "seats very hard and narrow"
We flew from Brisbane to London return via Abu Dhabi. Upgraded to First class from Brisbane to Abu Dhabi. Very comfortable, no complaints re food, service or comfort. Abu Dhabi to London return the business class seats very hard and narrow, but service excellent. Wheelchair in Abu Dhabi is easy and efficient. Flight was full and main complaint was queuing for the toilets which is not usually expected in Business Class. Returning on the Boeing 787 in Business Class, the seat is very firm, and considering we had almost an extra two hours on a 14 hour flight they did not get to feel any softer. Service top rate considering there were no empty seats and lots of noisy children in Business Class.

### "does not show customers interest"
Bangkok to Dublin via Abu Dhabi with Etihad Airways. First of as a silver frequent flyer member you cannot check in at the business class desk, as with my former airline of choice. First flight was ok but the stewards were not very interested in service. Food I can say was abysmal, really poor and I would go as far as the worst slop I have had on an airline. I don't mean just this flight, but every flight with Etihad has the same substandard meals. Hence we always bring a lunch when we can to counter this. The second flight was something the same - stewards were nowhere to be seen, no juice being offered periodically. The meal was offered maybe 2 hours before landing, a breakfast which was rushed and inedible. Between the meals and the lack of interest shown by the stewards I am changing my airline of choice. Price drove me to this airline but I will move to another as Etihad Airways does not show their customers enough interest or their frequent flyer customers.

### "Etihad Airways staff were worse"
Bangkok to Belgrade via Mumbai and Abu Dhabi. I'm a silver frequent flyer of Air Serbia and Etihad Airways. Some weeks ago I bought a ticket from Belgrade to Thailand and back via Etihad. I chose to travel with Etihad. Before I purchased the ticket I've checked with Etihad Airways about having 2 pieces of baggages 23kg each, using lounges on connecting airports and they confirmed all of that. When I bought the ticket I choose type of meals and seats for the flights. During my route out to Thailand everything was as expected without any problems. A few days before I was to fly back I received e-mail from Etihad reminding me about return flight, offering to check-in online and confirming my seats. My suffering started the moment I arrived at Bangkok Airport. The flight was operated by Jet Airways and they refused to check me in without paying extra for excess baggage (200USD) although they are Etihad partner. They didn't provide me seats and food that I had already confirmed in e-mail and was provided on my way to Thailand. Staff was rude. In Mumbai I thought it would be better since there is Etihad Airways staff but they were worse. Not helping with seats nor food, nor being polite. Also I was denied excess to lounge in Mumbai without a reason although I have right and I confirmed that before buying ticket. Finally I thought in Abu Dhabi everything will be resolved but the headquarters are the worst. There was an employee yelling at me for their mistakes! It's been a month and no resolution. They say they will refund me money but it's been a month and they didn't even asked for my bank account number. They replied to me only after I shared my experience online and when I found their CEO's e-mail and included him in correspondence. On every step of my trip there was a problem. My last flight back home was Air Serbia so I was relieved because I am their frequent flyer and that is my national airline, (unfortunately owned by Etihad Airways) but they still have old standards of hospitality and good service - unlike Etihad. From my experience even Jet Airways is more professional then Etihad. I travel a lot and I can recommend other companies like Emirates, Turkish Airlines, Air Serbia, Lufthansa.

### "staff welcoming, attentive and courteous"
London to Singapore via Abu Dhabi. This was my first experience flying with Etihad after 15 years with Emirates First class, and I think Etihad were better in most respects. Chauffeur service was good in UK and Singapore. Lounges generally good with high levels of service, except for SATS lounge in Singapore which was overcrowded with no service. Flights were excellent, punctual and very comfortable. A380 in particular was a spacious and comfortable suite. Restrooms were strangely dark and poorly lighted, with small showers compared to Emirates. Service from cabin staff was welcoming, attentive and courteous, with my name used at all times. I really likes the onboard chef service, who produced lovely meals cooked to order and served on request. All in all great experience and I look forward to future flights with Etihad. I only fly long haul about once a year and have found Emirates to have become a bit complacent with patchy levels of service and food.

### "A380 far roomier and more pleasant"
London Heathrow to Male via Abu Dhabi, good chauffeur service. Swift check in and fast track security. Great Etihad Airways lounge for first and business class customers. Very good flight to Abu Dhabi, attentive staff, Seats 7D/7E - my seat didn't fully recline to flat bed but I still managed a few hours sleep. The only thing is the area felt cramped, I'm 5 9 and my feet were squashed at the end. At Abu Dhabi we had a 2 hour stopover, the lounge is usually a nice place but it was crammed and not that pleasant! Second flight to Male again good service, the advantage of flying with Etihad  is that you get fast track immigration vouchers avoiding the masses of people queuing to get through. Return flights again very good, although the Male business lounge is terrible. 4 hour stopover again in Abu Dhabi, the lounge quiet when we arrived but quickly became a scrum. A380 back to Heathrow, very turbulent for the first few hours but the plane handled it really well. Staff not so attentive but the plane just feels far roomier and more pleasant. Straight through immigration and arrivals and into chauffeur car back home.

### "seats were just too small"
Abu Dhabi to Washington, and we took Etihad because of it's advertisement. However, the seats were just too small, crew were a mixed of nice and friendly, and unfriendly who seemed to hate their work, wines and spirits are very controlled unlike Emirates and other big airlines. However, food and entertainment service were excellent and the plus was that US Passport Control and Custom is done right before the pre-boarding in Abu Dhabi. Nothing is perfect, but at least, Etihad provided it's passengers options. Me and my wife may still consider Etihad if we visit Abu Dhabi (a very nice place to tour) again just because of its positive services.

### "seats are crammed in"
Manchester to Bangkok via Abu Dhabi with Etihad Airways was the most miserable flight I have endured. So bad, that we forfeited our return tickets and came home with another carrier. What was so bad? Simply the lack of space. The seats are crammed in like a short haul holiday flight. The aisles were ridiculously narrow. There was minimal leg and elbow room, and very little padding in the seats. For 14 hours from Manchester to Bangkok it was excruciating.

### "A380 very comfortable seating"
London to Bangkok via Abu Dhabi. Nice lounge at Heathrow Terminal 4 excellent service, good selection of drinks and very comfortable seating. Onboard the A380 poor selection of drinks, poor in flight entertainment apart from the live sports. Food and service excellent, the onboard lounge ok. Abu Dhabi airport efficient, business lounge excellent beverages, facilities and service. The onward flight to Bangkok on Boeing 777, the seats a little narrow but  acceptable. Bangkok Louis Tavern lounge on return, poor food choice, poor beverage choice, wash room facilities average.

### "feedback channel is useless"
Hong Kong to Abu Dhabi. I'm a frequent flyer on Etihad Airways. Cabin service is usually great but it is ground services that needs a lot of improvement, in Abu Dhabi and in Hong Kong. The flight from HKG to AUH departs at 6pm, but the counter at SkyPier (for those traveling in by ferry from Macau) is closed for lunch till 3.30pm! I know that still leaves me ample time to transfer, but you usually need more time at HKG because of how far terminals and gates are. Knowing that there's a flight departing at 6pm, counter staff should know better than to shut a counter 3 hours before a flight. I had a terrible experience in Abu Dhabi that I will write in a separate review. The biggest problem with Etihad is their feedback channel is useless. I sent feedback for a very bad experience encountered in Abu Dhabi last month, and have yet to receive any form of response.

### "our air travel was awful"
Brussels to Phuket via Abu Dhabi. Second time we took Etihad Airways for this trip and second time that our air travel was awful. Especially the legroom in economy is a real disaster for people +1.80m - the Boeing 777 was painful. Awful food and drinks were very poor, only one glass of wine during dinner. On the way home (2x approx. 6.5 hours) only a bag with some snacks and a very small bottle of water and a small breakfast before landing were offered. No alcoholic drinks available although we were given a menu on which several alcoholic drinks were offered.

### "many upset customers"
I normally travel once every year from Dallas to Bangalore either by Emirates or other airlines. This time I tried Etihad Airways but regretted doing so. At the check in counter they weigh your hand baggage and send you back if it is more than 400g. Every person who was travelling was sent back, they had to reshuffle their weight and come back. After all this was done, once you pass security and are about to board the flight, there is an Etihad rep standing there with a weighing machine to weigh your hand baggage again. There were so many upset customers, 1 passenger had reshuffled things between her purse and hand baggage and the weight went up. She was asked to put items back in her purse so her hand carry weight was 7kgs - it didn't make any sense. I didn't have any problem while going but on the way back the Etihad reps at BLR airport gave me a hard time for having a bulky purse. I have never been questioned one time for carrying a bulky purse.

### "staff service was good"
Dublin to Islamabad via Abu Dhabi with Etihad Airways. Overall flight was good, inflight nanny and staff service was good. The flight from Abu Dhabi to Islamabad was bit mismanaged. The worst meal service ever experienced, only served 1 proper meal in 13 hours of flight, small sandwich served in next flight from Abu Dhabi to Islamabad.

### "plane was so cramped"
Manchester to Bangkok via Abu Dhabi. The staff worked hard and were helpful but the plane was so cramped, the aisles very narrow so that people and trolleys constantly bumped into the seats on either side. The seats were small but worse they were so hard. Leg room was cramped and I'm not that tall! Seats 19 A/C, 28 A/B. The food was terrible. They couldn't find my meal and so brought a meal through from business class - quinoa and roasted beetroot which was dry and unappetising (glad I didn't pay to upgrade). Though we did ask at check-in about buying an upgrade we were refused as the ticket we bought through an agent didn't allow them to get into the system to do this. We spent a total of 14 hours plus in Etihad seats and were so fed up with the experience that we booked tickets with another airline to make the return journey. I will never fly with Etihad again. We were constantly told that Etihad have won recommendations and awards - who from I want to ask.

### "meals and service superb"
Etihad Airways from Mumbai to Washington via Abu Dhabi. Business Class on the Boeing 787 has a subtler finish giving the cabin a more open, less claustrophobic feel than the 777. Wifi connections to meals and service provided onboard from cabin crew are all superb. My only grouse is the shambolic boarding process for Business Class passengers (at all stations) who board with 300+ Y Class passengers, even as less than a handful of First Class passengers stroll onboard via their own dedicated aerobridge. It doesn't create for a very premium experience for the 20-30 Business Class passengers.

### "coach to Dubai a hassle"
Bad service from Sydney to Dubai and Dubai to Sydney (currently at Etihad Travel Mall). From Sydney to Dubai it take a while when call for assistance on flight. Flight attendant forgotten to come back for tea and waited 10 minutes. As soon as arrived in Abu Dhabi we got to the coach to go to Dubai which is a hassle. They told us that it will be in Dubai international airport drop off zone, but instead got drop off at Etihad Travel Mall, which meant we have to get a taxi to Dubai International Airport to pick up our hire. In general most hotel have service to pick up at Dubai international airport which save $$$$. So if you ever fly to Dubai take an airline which lands in Dubai airport.

### "business suite is excellent"
Having read some mixed reviews about Etihad business Class I was slightly apprehensive about our trip to Sydney from London Heathrow. I am pleased to say that this was unfounded and I would thoroughly recommend Etihad and their business class offering. The lounges at all airports were excellent with waiter service available at all locations as well as an all day menu. The A380 upper deck is quiet and the business suite is excellent, it is worth noting that if you are traveling as a couple you should book the forward facing centre seats as the other options will not allow you to sit together. Etihad offer the flexible dining option and my only small criticism is that this means service can sometimes be a bit hit or miss however this is easily resolved by requesting a flight attendant who will happily get you whatever you want. The food quality and choice was excellent and the cabin crew were friendly and really did try to make sure that you had everything you needed. On each flight the flight attendant introduced themselves and asked if you had any questions or requirements during the flight, on one leg my wife decided not to eat and they double checked before landing that she didn't want a quick snack, again good attention to detail. The inflight entertainment is good, particularly the live sport, I watched a UK premiership match live in the air, something I wouldn't have been able to do on the ground. In conclusion I would have no hesitation in recommending Etihad and will certainly fly with them again.

### "a pleasure to fly with"
Okay so I am a frequent flyer and tend to always go for the cheapest flights where I will still be able to get miles on my flights (partners). On the Johannesburg to Abu Dhabi leg Etihad uses the Jet Airways configured A330-200, I thought that this will be one bad flight, but actually after my flights on the Etihad aircraft preferred the Jet Airways planes, the seat are more comfortable, and entertainment is the same as Etihad. Etihad food is great and I enjoy flying them. The Airport is a downer, but I have visited worse airports. Etihad is a pleasure to fly with, I am a frequent flyer member with them and will fly them again end of March to New York.

### "services have deteriorated"
I recently completed a return trip from Frankfurt to Bangkok via Abu Dhabi on Etihad Airways. On two flights out of four my special meal was catered on two flights only. In addition my luggage was damaged and on arrival in Frankfurt the phone number provided by Etihad to contact the handling agent is no longer in service. None of this is acceptable. Etihad used to be a very decent airline in the past. Too bad their services have deteriorated.

### "never fly Etihad again"
This has got to be the worst plane we have flown on. We flew Manchester to Sydney via Abu Dhabi in October and flew Manchester to Abu Dhabi in February and on all flights it was the Boeing 777 (3-4-3 seating). The seats were rock hard, both me and my husband had to sit on our blankets and cushions for some padding. We are in our early 60s and I weigh 8stone 10lbs and my hubby weighs 12 stone 6lbs, so we are by mo means skinny or overweight and we were uncomfortable on all flights. These planes are old and obviously well worn. The seats are also very narrow so it was very uncomfortable trying to eat our meals. We are well travelled and the meals on these flights were not good quality. In fact we have flown on no frills airlines and have had better meals. I cannot understand how anyone would travel on Etihad if they have the choice of Emirates. To make things worse they now only allow 23kgs in economy instead of the 30kgs pre Sept 2015. I think that is disgusting on long haul flights. Hopefully we will never fly Etihad again.

### "definitely use again"
London Heathrow to Singapore visa Abu Dhabi with Etihad Airways, and I was anxious about using this airline. Can honestly say that the flights both to and from Singapore was great. Flights on time. Friendly staff. Great refreshments. Good selection of films. The flight from Abu Dhabi to Singapore was on a Boeing 787 which was a bit cramped and the seats uncomfortable - but no worse than other airlines. Would definitely use again.

### "airline losing my luggage"
Paris to Brisbane via Abu Dhabi. Horrible flight with the airline losing my luggage. It has been days now and I have been calling the customer service lines with no change, they don't even know where my suitcase could even be! None of the service employees have gone out of their way to even apologise to me let alone do their job in finding the suitcase that has all of my souvenirs from the last two months of travelling.

### "want to hold accountable"
Toronto to Abu Dhabi, and my baggage was delayed by about a week. I was told that I would receive a compensation for this delay. I submitted all the required paperwork to Etihad Airways but no response. I sent them 7 reminder emails over the last 6 months. I have also called them twice, both times I was told that they had informed the baggage department in Abu Dhabi to process my compensation and assured me I would receive my compensation within the week. Nothing so far. I believe that Etihad never intended to pay me a compensation, and just said so to calm me down when my bag was lost. At this point I don't care so much about the compensation, which is a minimal amount. I just want to hold Etihad accountable for their earlier statements.

### "cabin crew were attentive"
Flew Etihad Airways from Abu Dhabi to Manchester. The online check in was fast and efficient. We boarded on time and managed to arrive earlier than expected - a bonus. The seats were narrow and not that soft/comfortable. It did not help that the flight was full. The cabin crew were attentive and helpful. The food was okay but I did not like the menu - a matter of personal preference. Inflight entertainment is good, but, Emirates has a more extensive collection. Overall, Etihad is a good airline, but, far from being great.

### "airmiles as a compensation"
Delhi to Paris via Abu Dhabi, first Etihad Airways experience and was horrible one. The flight from Delhi to Abu Dhabi got delayed and I missed connection. No lounge was provided. Stayed with family at airport wandering around for the whole night. Next morning flight to Paris, they did not upgrade to business while the entire business was empty. Lost out on our Disney park tickets (pre booked) and one day hotel (pre booked at Paris) due to their delay. After repeated use of their Twitter handle, they responded and gave me airmiles as a compensation for all my trouble. Sorry but being a frequent flyer, I am not flying them again. I should have read reviews here before booking with them. Whatever I saved on airfare (they were cheaper than Swiss or Air France) got lost due to delays.

### "how bad it is going to be"
Booked Etihad Airways flights in August 2015 because it was the only one that fit our travel needs. Still haven't flown yet (April 2016) and already our itinerary has been changed 4 times. The last 2 showed that our previously confirmed return seats were eliminated and showed that we had to check in. Also surcharged $675.00 for fuel even though fuel prices are at 12 year record lows. Complaints have gone unresponded to, even though we were told that someone would respond. That included a telephone call that I am still waiting for. If this is just the type of service you get on the ground, then I can just imagine how bad it is going to be if we get to get on board at all.

### "never have enough meals onboard"
Etihad Airways from Amsterdam to Bangkok via Abu Dhabi return, and crew on both flights were excellent. The seats were a little tight for a business class cabin, but if you sit in a aisle seat they are not too bad. Food was good but one complaint with Etihad is they never have enough meals onboard, so you always end up with a second choice. If you want to guarantee your meal choice you need to sit two lines from the back. Abu Dhabi was a very uncomfortable experience, buses were laid on for arriving passengers. Everybody was herded into a small entrance with hundreds of other people in the same queue from other aircraft disembarking. I have to say this was one of the most disorganised places I have ever experienced it can only described as a scrum. People pushing, others confused and the ground staff unwilling to assist. Fast Track pass given to Business CIass customers that was totally useless. Spent 60 minutes trying to get through a transfer desk that was equally disorganised. Sadly I did not make it to the lounge due to Etihad's total disorganisation. Once again trying to board to BKK was total chaos, firstly Etihad Ground Staff do not have sufficient training to control a crowd and secondly the customers seem to leave their brains at home when it comes to listen to various commands.

### "fly with them again"
Manchester to Abu Dhabi with Etihad Airways, and a Boeing 777 was used on this flight. The seating was on a 3-4-3 configuration and it kind of looked and felt cramped. I was lucky not to have anyone seated beside me, but still it felt like it. With the seats going to the negative side of the spectrum, Etihad, however, has a lot to offer on the positives. The cabin crew made the flight as comfortable and enjoyable as possible. The food was good and we were kept hydrated throughout the flight. Overall, the flight was okay. I will fly with them again.

### "food fairly basic"
Manila to London via Abu Dhabi with Etihad Airways. Food fairly basic, especially the snack meal before landing which was pot noodles, and on another leg a pocket sandwich. Asian flight attendants were good and friendly, Eastern European flight attendants noticeably less friendly. Announcements in English were fairly unintelligible and pursers need to slow down and focus on pronouncing their words. A380 seats and toilets were better, cleaner and more comfortable than the Boeing 777. Entertainment system good. Price was very cheap which is of course good. Next time will fly Emirates as really hate Abu Dhabi airport

### "went without a hitch"
Sydney to Edinburgh via Abu Dhabi return in business class with Etihad Airways, and all four legs went without a hitch. Staff friendly and attentive, food service was excellent. Lie flat bed very comfy. IFE endless. I was able to watch the RWC match between Scotland and Japan live.

### "seats are far too hard"
Dublin to Sydney via Abu Dhabi, and first time flying Etihad in over 2 years. First leg from Dublin on A330 was the better of the two legs. Seats in a 2-4-2 config which is I feel more comfortable. Flight on time and plane clean. Crew on this flight were professional and friendly. Flight to Sydney from Abu Dhabi delayed over an hour with no announcement from staff, boarding area for the A380 is far too small with hundreds of people cramped into a small space with little seating available, we stood for over an hour. The A380 itself is spacious and modern, however the seats are far too hard for a 13 hour flight. Food was average with the crew disinterested to say the least. Will stick with Emirates in future if the price is comparable.

### "Boeing 787 was very nice"
Dublin to Brisbane via Abu Dhabi. On time. Felt safe. Bags arrived with plane. Staff nice enough but not over attentive (I am being polite). Food good enough for me and was not hungry on either sectors. Plenty of water available. Boeing 777 was nice, and Boeing 787 was very nice, had new plane smell. Seats and pitch as good as you will get in coach. 787 entertainment system very nice on specifications, shame on the content. On my way to Dublin had to get stairs and buses this time airbridge all the way, much better. The bad, Etihad trying the old carry on baggage scam and weighed my carry on and inspected it's dimensions. If it was not to the new rules then it's big dollars. Wanted 270 Euros if I wanted an exit seat - unacceptable if one has not been purchased before flight and is available on the day. Drink and food carts very poorly designed and kept banging into passengers on aisle seats, that included me. In flight entertainment system very poor on content especially for 13 hour sector.

### "I would recommend"
I travelled home to Ireland for Christmas and unfortunately, got sick a few fays before I was to return to Australia. Thinking it was just a normal cold, I flew out of Dublin and onto Abu Dhabi. I spoke to the cabin crew just to let them know that I wasn't feeling 100%, in case anything was to happen while in transit. I deteriorated during the flight and as we landed, I was extremely unwell. The cabin crew were attentive and worried about me during this time and being a girl travelling alone, this was very comforting. On arriving in Abu Dhabi, I was taken to the medical assessment area where I was taken care of and it was recommended that I did not take my connecting flight. I was taken to the Etihad Transfer Desk where ground staff organised a hotel for the night and booked me on the same flight 24 hours later, all complimentary. I had a great rest and was feeling much better to travel the next day. I wanted to say thank you for your assistance and care. The staff made me feel very comfortable and reassured me that it would all be ok, which it was. I had never travelled with Etihad before but after this experience, I would recommend and thanks again.

### " worst flying experience"
Lagos to Mangalore via Abu Dhabi, and the worst flying experience so far on Etihad Airways. Was supposed to take off from Lagos at 09.25, but the departure time changed to 10.20 without any announcement. We finally barded and taxied around 11.00, but only to return to gate after an hour. We got off plane and made to wait amidst chaos till 15.00. Staff were clueless about how to handle crowd. Finally we were loaded into buses and lodged in a hotel. Again, a most customer unfriendly hotel. This is second untoward experience with Etihad Airways in 6 months. Just feeling disgusted.

### "lowered baggage size"
I flew Etihad Airways from Chicago to Abu Dhabi return, and they have lowered the size of permitted Cabin Baggage with a length of 50cm (many major airlines this 55-56cm). At least they should have mentioned this on the ticket, and a lot of people including me had to pay an extra $300 to checkin the cabin baggage. Once in the flight, I thought the attendants were rude, especially when they were serving meals, the passenger next to me was sleeping so they didnt serve him food. After sometime when he got up and asked what he could have, they just said the food is over. The only advantage I felt with Etihad was that on the return flight,  US immigration is done at Abu Dhabi Airport that saved me time at Chicago airport.

### "lost my money and time"
Abu Dhabi to Bangalore and a good experience with this Etihad Airways flight. But the connection flight to Chennai through their partner airlines (Jet Airways) was the real trouble. This flight arranged by Etihad was operated by Jet Airways, who cancelled the flight from Bangalore to Chennai, and they did not arrange any alternate solution. I talk with Etihad Airways and Jet Airways customer service, and both are blaming each other. I lost my money and time.

### "customer service unsatisfactory"
Dublin to Nairobi via Abu Dhabi and a fairly positive experience inflight - nice cabin, friendly staff and the food was edible. My bags however were delayed. This can happen to any airline, but my issue is that since my return I have made a claim with the airline with regards to the costs incurred as a result of the baggage delay. For the last 3 months I have sent countless emails without a single reply from the Etihad Airways baggage claim team or their supposed feedback team. The level of customer service is completely unsatisfactory and downright unprofessional. It is simply not good enough. I would advise people to avoid Etihad at all costs, as when something does go wrong they are nowhere to be found.

### "seat is comfortable"
Bangkok to São Paulo via AUH with Etihad Airways. Check in was okay at BKK Airport. Etihad shares the longe with Thai, so its hard to find in the airport, not comfortable, limited selection of food and beverages. Boarding was a little confused. Once I was seated, things changed. The business cabin chief introduced herself and asked what I would like to drink. Also asked when I wanted the meal to be served. You can choose from 3 diferent menus what you'd like to eat and when. Seat is comfortable and full 180' flat bed. Entertainment is OK, but no wifi available. Arriving in AUH on time, hired the excellent meet and greet service: they meet you at the aircraft door, escort you to the business lounge and pick you up back to board next flight. All in all a good experience. I will fly again if I get a good business class offer.

### "A380 was brilliant"
London Heathrow to Abu Dhabi return and my first time on an A380 which was brilliant. On the outbound flight, the plane was almost full, but the return flight was almost empty. The product is marvellous and food was also nice, staff were friendly. Seat pitch of good size and a good selection of movies and entertainment. However, I was a little bit disappointed as were were not served drinks after the aircraft was airborne. They were not served until before the lunch. Emirates serves these soon after takeoff.

### "food quality seems worse"
Abu Dhabi to Hyderabad with Etihad Airways, travelling with two kids aged 6 and 8. The food quality seems to keep getting worse. Two screens out of the three were not functional, and of course staff are unable to help with this predicament. The website did not allow me to check online for some reason though this has never happened before. This caused additional inconvenience as I was travelling with children. They have partnered with Jet Airways on this route and are unable to maintain quality. Had travelled to Chicago early this year and the service was excellent on that route.

### "not respond until after I returned"
Edinburgh to Bangkok via Abu Dhabi. Poor seats that didn't recline, dirty table, poor service and terrible food. I complained about broken seats that didn't reline but was told just needed to stay, as flight was full. Emailed Etihad four times to try and solve the problem for return flight over a 2 week period, they did not respond until after I returned. They offered me 10000 air miles for the dirty tables, non relining seats, missed connections and lost luggage. First and last time I will use Etihad. If you want wifi you have to pay, staff on 2 of the 4 flights had to be asked 4-5 times for water and tea.

### "a pleasant experience"
Lagos to Dubai via Abu Dhabi with Etihad Airways. The flight was delayed by about 30 minutes in Lagos due to late arrival but once airborne everything was quite organised, snacks served within 30 minutes of take off, meals were quite hot. There were drinks on request. IFE was okay considering that I was able to watch CNN and BBC live, I didn't try the wifi. My kids were entertained with the cartoons. Attendants were very friendly and quite busy through the flight period. Check in Lagos was smooth and easy, got my bags after clearing immigration at Abu Dhabi. Express coach was on ground to take me and my family to Dubai once we were outside the airport. Overall it was a pleasant experience. If you are on a tight budget then you might want to consider this airline.

### "the trip was fine"
First time using Etihad Airways. Unable to check in online for whatever reason, however I noticed the bagdrop at T4 was the same length as the check in line! Boarding quick I booked the front seat 40J on the lower deck, full flight but seat was fine, with no seat in front and lots of room. PTV worked well, great screen and noise cancelling headset. Food and service was okay. Landed about 10 min late which with a short 45 min connection for the connection to DXB (via road) meant missing the bus with no options for 3 hrs. I chose to pay for a taxi myself. Etihad Airways  ground staff at AUH are pretty useless and uninterested. Return checked in at the Ethiad Travel Mall in Dubai with connection to AUH via road, bags checked to LHR. Once at AUH quick security I also paid for a lounge which was okay. Again seat 40J. Flight departed on time at 02:30am, a quick snack before lights out, breakfast served about 2 hrs out of Heathrow. The trip was fine as expected. I might try again in business class for the right price but would probably opt for Qatar Airways given the choice.

### "32 hour nightmare"
I booked Singapore to Larnaca return trip through them, assuming they would be at par with the other Arab airlines. My nightmare started when the airline decided to simply cancel my flight and rebook me to a return flight 4 days later. They assume people have no job. Then they changed my single stop flight to a triple stop 32 hour nightmare. No apologies, no refund, no explanation. During this ordeal, I was told by one of the so called Etihad Airways staff in Abu Dhabi that we would be upgraded to business class in order to access the lounge in at least 1 of the legs of this hellish flight. Not only did that not happen, and I had to spend a total of 11 hours in transit walking around airport like a gypsy, we had no food on the last leg of the flight. To top it all, after 32 hours they lost both out luggage, despite confirmations at each leg of the way that the luggage was on board. Yes, the planes were pretty, but that can be taken for granted on all these airlines. This was by far the worst airline I ever flown on. The cheap fare is not worth it.

### "fares are competitive"
Kuala Lumpur to London via Abu Dhabi. I fly from UK to and from Asia several times a year in economy and choose Etihad Airways. Fares are competitive and service excellent. On the last occasion the flight from Kuala Lumpur was delayed to mean the connection in Abu Dhabi for the flight to LHR was missed but I received notification of the change in flight times well in advance, and was kept informed of what was going on. I always check in online and the process is very smooth when I turn up to the airport in person. Service and food on both flights was also fine. Crew were busy - full flights but were attentive and available. Abu Dhabi airport struggles to keep up with the movements of passengers at peak times so the airport is pretty congested when you arrive there early morning or late at night so queues at transit security are always long. Also the use of coaching gates and longish bus rides from aircraft to terminal is not what I like but seems unavoidable given the rapid growth at AUH - I look forward to the airport enhancements.

### "avoid long haul B777"
Brussels to Melbourne via Abu Dhabi. Chose Etihad as they offered a slghtly cheaper fare and I flew with them a couple of times for business purposes which were good experiences. Flights arrived slightly ahead of schedule and layover in Abu Dhabi was bearable. A330 between BRU and AUH is comfortable with good seat width and legroom - being 1m90 tall it is possible to fully stretch my legs under the seat in front. The B777 (3 class) is another story - the seat width is ok if you take the window seat (not as claustrophobic as I read). The legroom was however limited by the support bar of the seat in front and it is not possible to fit your leg in between the bar and the side of the plane. This makes it rather uncomfortable for a 13h flight. Maybe an aisle seat would have been slightly better. Service from the staff was very good on the flights between BRU and AUH. Friendly with a smile, and frequent drinks service. Between AUH and MEL it was not as good but still okay. Food was good except for the breakfasts. It’s announced as a ‘light breakfast’ on the menu but it is heavy and sweet. IFE was ok but lacked comedy shows episodes. The touchscreens are not the best but with the remote it can be navigated quickly. In short their A330 service is very good and would fly them again. I'd however avoid an Etihad long haul B777 flight in the future if competition offers similar prices.

### "budget airline experience"
I usually fly with Qatar Airways but took a chance on Etihad Airways due to timings on Manchester to Hong Kong via Abu Dhabi. Never again. From the minute I got to check in where they weighed and measured my hand luggage it felt like a budget airline experience. Onboard the flight the temperature was freezing cold. I asked for another blanket 4 times altogether and kept being told they were busy. One attendant told me to look around at how busy they all were as if I was being ridiculous to expect an extra blanket after waiting almost an hour. The staff never came round to offer drinks; they repeatedly ignored people's call requests for attendance; even just the basics like eye contact and a friendly smile or asking if we were OK were noticeably absent. I had an uncomfortable flight and will not travel with Etihad again. It made me realise what a superior airline Qatar is.

### "downfall seems to be staff"
Melbourne to London via Abu Dhabi. Their biggest downfall seems to be the staff - there is no bond or connection between staff and customers like when traveling on other airlines, and when the crew try to speak English over the PA system I didn't understand much of it. I had a 4 hour stop over in Abu Dhabi which wasnt very good, as most of us were tired and just walked to the gate and chilled out before the final leg - but most people was left standing or sitting on the tiled floor because they didn't open the transit lounge for our gate. Eventually somebody moved the barriers and open up the area themselves which led to people moving in like sardines as it was getting very busy in the walkway at this time. It didn't take long for the customs people to appear from nowhere and throw everybody out and once again to go through our second security check before we could just sit down. Apart from that poor effort of the staff the food was nice and they come around with water often. They dont seem to advertise snacks and extra drinks out of meal times like other airlines. Seats nothing special but had worse, although there was more legroom on the A340 compared to the Boeing 777 aircraft we flew.

### "food quality has dropped"
For the past three years I have never arrived my destination on time; being late for 45min - 90min was a norm. I am not exaggerating when I say not punctual, as I frequently fly back and forth between Singapore and Abu Dhabi. Longest delay was 90+ minutes. In Abu Dhabi, many times we have to take a bus to the airport for immigration, which again, after 7 hours of flying, you need to squeeze with the rest of the passengers from the plane, making it unpleasant. Initially the plane was a A330, which was small and congested, and now a Boeing 787, aisle is small and the trolley constantly will hit you if you ever sit on the aisle. The food quality has dropped, with Etihad opting for a more exotic selection of food, but turned out not to be good. In all, rather disappointed with Etihad considering the cost and the service provided. Punctuality is the major flaw in Etihad. Etihad does have friendly stewardess who can speak multiple languages and cater to your needs.

### "recommend the apartment"
This is the second time on the A380 apartment and one can actually move around, crew were excellent. Being a vegan is normally very daunting as being provided with a tasty airline meal is hard despite the class of travel. The onboard chef made effort in providing a wonderful tasty meal. My only gripe would be on the ground where staff in Abu Dhabi could have been a little more responsive. I cannot recommend the apartment enough.

### "complaints procedure diabolical"
London to Melbourne via Abu Dhabi with Etihad Airways in business class. The duration of flight was fine, no problem. However 3 out of 4 bags were left in Abu Dhabi, one of which we thought was lost. The customer service afterwards was extremely uncaring and disgusting. The complaints procedure was diabolical to the extent that our emails were ignored and the final outcome was unsatisfactory. We are extremely distressed by what has happened and can find no excuse for their attitude. We flew business class, which we struggle to do financially but, because of our age it is necessary, and one woud expect exemplary service. The shortfall was enormous.

### "atrocious experience"
An absolutely atrocious experience. I booked business class tickets on Etihad early 2015 for a December flight from New York to Delhi via Abu Dhabi. The service on the ground was pretty good, as was the business seat on the flight. However, halfway through my flight to Abu Dhabi, the hostess approached me and said that one of my bags was left in NYC. Way to ruin the rest of my flight! She mentioned that it would be on the next flight 3 hours later and get to Delhi the same night, guaranteed. During the layover at Abu Dhabi, I checked the status of the bag, and Etihad said that it was all a misunderstanding, the bag had not in fact been left behind. So I arrived at Delhi expecting to find my bag. After waiting a full hour for the bag to come after being reassured by ground staff that I simply had to wait a "couple more minutes" I decided to talk to the lost baggage people. They had absolutely no clue what they were doing and haphazardly wrote me and incomplete missing baggage report to shuffle me out of their way. They also said that the bag would be delivered within 12 hours. After waiting 24 hours and calling the phone number they gave me at least 20 times (no joke), I finally got a response. Etihad said that they didn't know where the bag was. Anyway, to summarize the rest of the story, I got the bag 3 days later. All in all, Etihad Airways treated a business class passenger and family horribly. They didn't pick up the phone for the most part, were irresponsible both on ground and in the air, and were unable to handle the situation once it had happened.

### "break this tie up"
When Etihad Airways have a tie up with another airline (Jet Airways), why not work as partners. My connecting flight from Mumbai to Geneva via Abu Dhabi was delayed for reasons known only to the airlins itself, and we were assured our connecting flight from Abu Dhabi (Etihad Airways) would wait for us. But that didn't happen and my flight was missed, I had take the night flight instead. Do Etihad Airways think I am jobless and it's ok to take later flight. If you can't coordinate well, please break this tie up because it's just a nuisance. This is the 3rd time with me it has happened, but the last time. I vow never to take Etihad Airways or Jet Airways again.

### "brainless decision making"
Dublin to Phuket via Abu Dhabi with Etihad Airways. Delayed at Dublin due to weather. In reality, 2 business class passengers checked in but never arrived. We waited while their names were continually announced while at the same time the pilot informing us that the delay was due to rain. The consequence was a tight transfer time which my 5 year old daughter and I managed to make only to be told we were booked on another flight to Bangkok (not Phuket). I refused this option and was told we would be put up in a hotel in Abu Dhabi. My daughter holds both Irish and Thai passports. She was travelling on the Thai passport but we needed a visa to leave the airport which we were told would not be a problem but eventually was. Then discovered my daughter's Irish passport was out of date (my fault obviously). So we had to stay within the airport. The result was spending the next 24hrs in Abu Dhabi airport spending the night in a cell-like room. We could not buy new clothes in duty free (Plenty of Prada sunglasses or Tag watches though). Eventually arriving in Phuket almost three days after departing from Dublin. What bothered me most was the lying/lack of proper management/brainless decision making/arrogance of some staff members which led to this situation happening in the first place. While I would never say never again, I will be checking out any and all alternatives next time.

### "Never again with them"
Pathetic ground service before and after the flight. I had 2 stops and the routing was ORD-AUH-DEL-BLR, with DEL-BLR on Etihad's partner Jet Airways. My dissappointment began right at ORD. There was a huge crowd at check-in and the staff were visibly uninterested in their work. Got my boarding pass after waiting for an hour. My long name was not printed fully on the boarding pass but the staff said it was alright. Yet, the TSA refused to let me in and back I went to the counter - where I was made to wait in line again! Then, the staff wrote the missing characters of my name on the pass with a pen, signed it and said that should work, and it did. Why could this not have been done earlier? This might not have been new to them since long names are fairly common where I fly to! Past this, my disappointment got much bigger towards the end of the flight. Both ORD-AUH EY150 and AUH-DEL EY224 were delayed, because of which I missed my DEL-BLR Jet Airways 8 pm flight. Etihad had no single point of contact at DEL while Jet Airways refused to put us on the next flight without 'talking' to Etihad. Some guy, supposedly the Etihad staff at DEL (though he had an Air India name tag and no Etihad naming at the counter) wrote down our names and booking reference in a used piece of paper and disappeared for the next three hours. The stranded passengers were left at the Jet Airways counter. Jet Airways staff never cared anyway and left work as it got late! So much for the hyped Jet-Etihad partnership. Another group of stranded passengers found the absconding Etihad guy and his colleagues somewhere else in the terminal, informed us and then we were given connecting flights the next morning and a room at a hotel. Still, no proper arrangements were made to transport us to the hotel and every 4 passengers and all their baggage were dumped in a tiny midsize sedan to be taken to the hotel with multiple trips. There was more mix-up the next morning - Jet Airways said the bookings made by the Etihad guy were not confirmed, and refused to commit to us our flight timings. Thankfully, my flight had two vacant seats, one of which was given to me at the last minute. I ran to the boarding gate just as the final boarding call got concluded. Etihad made a simple long haul travel a real nightmare. Never again with them, ever.

### "inflight below average"
While the seats were comfortable, entertainment good, and ticket counter service above average, the service and food inflight were below average. It seems Etihad Airways hire young people who are not very patient or graceful with the wide array of nationalities and personalities they would deal with. On several occasions I saw young flight stewards tell customers to wait their turn, or be patient in a manner that was unnecessarily gruff and rude. One even put her hand up to a man's face when he aimed to clarify how many vegetarian meals his family had ordered. You would have thought he had directly insulted her. The staff seem a bit on edge and do the minimum in the department of friendly service. I must say how unacceptable it is that they serve warm drinks with no ice available, including hard liquor. People were getting hot sodas, and uniced straight whiskey. Why is there no ice? This is ridiculous. It was like this to and from Asia from North America. It seems to be a planned thing. Never order 'vegetarian' meals, they are the most flavorless, fatless meals ever. They believe vegetarian means 'vegan' and they gave me a meal of a bunch of pasta balls with a boring dry minimal tomato sauce and a bean salad that looked beautiful but was not fully cooked. I should have ordered "Asian Vegetarian" which would included cheese. On one flight that was only partially filled, the staff were kind enough to find an Asian vegetarian meal to replace the very bland tasteless 'vegetarian' (but really bland vegan) meal and that meal was delicious. They had no tv shows that weren't fiction dramas - I would have liked some talk shows or news shows to learn about current events in different countries. Curt staff that don't know how to gracefully handle people who deserve a lot of respect, a lack of ice, and terrible vegan meals makes me rate the airline a bit lower than many other airlines I have flown with to get overseas.

### "harrowing experience"
On 1st of December 2015 with my wife I traveled from Washington to Chennai via Abu Dhabi. In Abu Dhabi Etihad Airways informed the flight to Chennai has been cancelled so early morning put us on flight EY 238 to Bangalore and left us helpless without our Checked in Baggage. So we had to wait in Bangalore for another 5 days before the airline could trace and return our luggage.. It was the most harrowing experience with Etihad Airways which did not bother to help us in anyway either with our stay in Bangalore or our transfer to Chennai..

### "suite great plenty of room"
One way flight AUH-BKK with Etihad Airways, had booked business class but were unable to check in on line. Limo was 40 mins late to pick up, no big deal and got us there in time. Were upgraded to first which was great as I am gold member. Lounge as ever good, not busy, food ok, couple of cocktails and boarded, Jet Airways configured aircraft. Suite great plenty of room, looking a bit aged. Overall food was good, wines great. Sleeper suits comfy and as this was a night flight, bed was made up and got 3 hours sleep. Arrived on time. Overall a pleasent experience, and grateful for the upgrade but I found the ground staff and air crews are loosing their touch, they appeared disorganized, unable to communicate, smiling was not in the guide book and lacked any sense of service training. I feel their must be issues in the camp with the retention of staff as both ground and air crew lacked the professional touch.

### "veg Pasta one of the worst"
I travelled Etihad Airways from London to Kathmandu on 11th December, and it was one of the worst ever. First thing you will be given the menu but when it comes to your place you won't get the meal of your choice because they got limited and you will be given veg Pasta which is one of the worst. If you are in last group of boarding your hand luggage will be given to the cargo with main luggage and they gonna say you that there is no enough space because it's a small aircraft. Its the third day of my arrival to Kathmandu and still today I have not got my main luggage. I have been wearing same dress for three days and planning to buy some today. It's really disgusting.

### "recruit experienced Managers"
The Etihad Airways flight to Abu Dhabi was very disorganised. One cabin crew member was clearly experienced whilst the other three in the cabin were clearly too inexperienced to work in the business class section. I also cannot work out why Etihad only had four Arabic Mezze's onboard when the flight had 22 business class passengers onboard. The other choice was soup that most passengers rejected. Seventy percent of the meals were served by the more experienced crew member due to the other three crew members not really having either the energy or enthusiasm to carry out this particular task. The seating arrangement is tight due to a lot of wasted plastic in the cabin. The flight from Abu Dhabi to Bangkok started in a scrum like manner due to the Ground Crew not adhering to their announcement that certain seat numbers would be boarded accordingly. On board again a bit chaotic this time the right hand side of the cabin was working well whilst the left hand side was non-existent. Again the more experienced members on the right had to help the left side out that were again clearly lacking in experience. The seats designated for couples on 777-300 I would avoid due to both plastic sides restricting your movement, I would choose the outside ones even if you get bumped from time to time. In conclusion this is an airline that needs to urgently recruit experienced Managers who can at least direct their crew accordingly otherwise they will struggle to find customers in this difficult market.

### "tale of two different flights"
The tale of two different flights. The flight from Bangkok was on a Jet Airways wet leased arrangement. The seating arrangement was not ideal and the continual neon light flashing underneath my table tray disrupted my sleep. The service onboard was very poor. The cabin crew even managed to forgot my drink and meal so I ended up with just a hard sandwich, in the end, due to a shortage of meals onboard. Cabin crew did apologise for their lack of service due to being understaffed. Abu Dhabi to Amsterdam you would have thought you were on a different airline. The Manager onboard made sure her crew provided a seamless business class service. The food was prepared to perfection and laid out exquisitely. The seat was fine albeit a little bit tight. So for the first flight I would have awarded Etihad Airways 1 and the second 10, hence my difficulty in scoring in this case.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Düsseldorf to Perth via Abu Dhabi returning from Melbourne. Check-in at Düsseldorf and Melbourne was professional and managed very well. The staff had a friendly approach. We were asked over to the First Class check-in desk as this was not being used at the time. Boarding was carried out in a logical order and special attention paid to families with children and disabled travellers. We were greeted by friendly and helpful staff. Stowing hand luggage was quick. Service was the best I have experienced. Menus provided after take-off, which offered a vegetarian, meat or fish option. All meals were substantial and delicious. I liked the couscous salads and stainless steel cutlery. I was pleased to see water provided by the cabin crew before take-off. When the drinks service slowed down there was water available at the rear of the plane. Comfort levels were good by economy standards. I managed about 3 to 4 hours of sleep on the return journey, which is good by my standards. I found the plane a little bit too cold on the DUS to AUH flight, so I'd advise other travellers to take a good sweater. However, a blanket is provided should you get too cold. Eye masks, headphones toothbrush and toothpaste are provided. A good selection of entertainment.

### "cabin crew looked aloof"
Abu Dhabi to Manchester. Etihad Airways was ok. Boarding didn't have a clear preference for frequent flyers, or if it did it wasn't clear nor enforced. Cabin crew looked aloof. I get that it is economy, but a sincere smile would go a long way. There doesn't seem to be a lot of cohesion amongst the crew. The pillows offer no support, but the blankets are fine. I travelled with the airline because I have my frequent flyer membership with a codeshare airline.

### "IFE screen was frozen"
Bahrain to Abu Dhabi on Etihad Airways. Flight departed 15 minutes late and landed late as well. The taxi time was close to 30 minutes. We were given a sandwich on this 1hr 10min flight. The IFE screen was frozen and we could not play the media. Coffee was not given to everyone, although I requested for it and they fortunately obliged.

### "new low in customer service"
A new low in customer service on 2 of the 4 flights on my recent trip with Etihad from Manchester to Bangkok. Not what was expected from (as we were reminded via the PA several times each flight!) 6 times airline of the year. Steward on Manchester to Abu Dhabi leg with no eye contact, no interaction, no chance of a smile - he only spoke to inform that drinks were restricted due to the flight being full and no ice or lemon available. Flight from Abu Dhabi to Bangkok okay, more for the fact that it was half full and crew able to cope due to less demands rather than providing good service. Bangkok to Abu Dhabi was a full flight and a return to poor service and shortages of refreshments - informed they had run out of water, orange juice, apple juice, ice and lemon. Had a problem with the seat back display but after several attempts to get it resolved I decided to spend the entire journey without it. Final flight Abu Dhabi to Manchester only half full and as it was an overnight, the crew had minimal demands on them so able to cope. I normally opt for Qatar Airways or Emirates, who have never provided a service this bad, and I will avoid flying with Etihad in future. Airline of the year 6 times running - don't make me laugh.

### "fabulous food, seat good"
Very smooth check in in Istanbul and they helped all the way through to departure. Lounge in Istanbul is shared with other airlines not so good. Onboard fabulous food, seat good and good IFE. At Abu Dhabi there was a staff waiting to take me through security to board my flight to Tokyo. Good service, same plane model. Bags first out, one drawback no chauffeur service available in Tokyo.

### "no one knew what was going on"
Our onboard facilities were great and attendants were very kind and professional. Etihad Airways logistics sucked beyond belief! Our flight was delayed. We were supposed to be rebooked, but on arrival no one knew what was going on. No rebooking. Made to wait in lounge for over an hour with no resolution. Lost an entire day. No hotel, no courtesy anything. All as a first class passenger! If this is a luxury airline I dread to think what happens to those in economy. A good airline is more than just nice cutlery and good seats. First they have to get passengers from A to B correctly. This airline is atrociously bad in the basic logistics of flying.

### "absolutely no acknowledgement"
Toronto to Lahore via Abu Dhabi return. This was my second business class trip with Etihad Airways, on the same route. In September, upon return to Toronto, my suitcase was damaged with the zipper mechanism and lock literally torn off. Photographs and documents were provided upon request after my initial e-mail to Etihad Airways. Since then, there has been absolutely no acknowledgement from baggage claims or customer service. Phone-calls have been answered with "Oh - we just take care of bookings etc. This was my second time travel with Etihad Airways and will likely be my last. Travel coming up this winter will not be with this airline - however, I would like them to respond positively to my claim.

### "after flight service is horrific"
Singapore to Venice via Abu Dhabi and Rome. Etihad Airways newer fleet is nicely appointed, the service in first and business is sometimes good, but mostly average. The after flight service from their baggage claims team and Etihad Guest Gold is horrific. Despite being in a proper, hard case bike box, my bike was damaged in transit and my suitcase was left behind in Abu Dhabi for the second time in twelve flights. I got the case back after 3 days. I was told that the claim for my bike would take up to five business days to resolve. It has been nearly 5 months since I flew. I have sent over 40 emails, 20 tweets, made 5 phone calls and asked for assistance via their web page. Every time I am provided with the same "non-response". I am thanked for being patient and am told that their baggage handling team will contact me soon. If they treat Gold members who fly business/first class like this can you imagine how they treat economy passengers who fly infrequently?

### "lack of customer service"
Return trip from Goa was with Jet Airways to Mumbai and from there to Manchester with Etihad Airways via Abu Dhabi. The time to transfer at Mumbai was 1hr 45 but Jet Airways was late so only 90 mins for transfer. Jet Airways put on a coach from plane to do the tranfer to international terminal at Mumbai - but this took time. The Jet Airways guy at Mumbai did his best to get us through but usual admin stuff at security and immigration took time. We got call on tannoy that we needed to get to our flight - last call! Jet Airways got running with another passenger to get to Etihad Airways flight but my wife cannot run (slightly disabled) - we missed flight home by 90 seconds! Etihad Airways staff member took us under wing - back through security into Immigration and then to Etihad Airways desk and advised to go to desk at 01.30am as booked on flight. Luggage would be transferred. Attended desk at 01.30 - denied all knowledge and in effect would do nothing. Eventually had to get luggage back and Jet Airways (not happy!) booked us on their flight to London 19.5 hours after we arrived at Mumbai Airport. The total lack of customer service, the utter confusion and there inability to resolve means we will never travel with Etihad Airways again.

### "better than I was expecting"
London to Bangkok via Abu Dhabi with Etihad Airways on the A380, good seating space in economy. Overall I enjoyed this flight and better than I was expecting from the reviews. The food was average, nothing special and entertainment was decent - not as huge selection as Emirates but not bad. Screen worked well too and staff were friendly. Bangkok to London however was a smaller plane and smaller seating area. Food and entertainment the same as above and staff not as friendly - not sure how they were voted middle east's best airline crew, Emirates is far better. I like how they gave us blanket, neck pillow and on some flights toothbrush etc. I was happy with the service overall. It is not as good as Emirates, but it still isn't bad.

### "disappointed and annoyed"
I have flown on Etihad Airways numerous times over the years. Initially as a young and still growing airline it was understandable that there would be staff training issues and indeed they did improve over time. Not having flown on Etihad Airways for some time I was very disappointed and annoyed with the service - or rather lack of service on my recent flight. My husband was seated in the same row and I watched as he was greeted, offered a drink towel etc whilst service remained notable in my aisle only by its absence. Oddly the gentleman sitting across from me received the same level of service as my husband! Drinks towels nuts, more drink! Order for snack was taken and I placed my breakfast order. Food was below average standard. Drink was refilled by male steward from opposite aisle who seemed to be popping across to lend a hand. Morning arrived and I awake to the sound of food being served so I sat up and got ready to receive my food. Again I watched as my husband who's not ordered food awoke and placed an order which arrived in under 10 minutes. And still I waited as people around me were served but it felt like I was once again wearing my invisibility cloak. Finally in exasperation my husband called the steward who seemed to be in charge and asked if she could find out what had happened to my food. She went off and then came to explain that they had an inexperienced staff and apologised for the delay. She returned with my food shortly afterwards. It was as bad as the night before's offering. The female steward responsible for not bothering to offer me any service did come to apologise claiming that she'd misunderstood. I do not like complaining but this level of service is not acceptable. It is not my problem Etihad Airways staff are inexperienced. One would assume that they should receive the correct training before letting them loose on the paying public. And why did the man across from me get such attentive service when I was bypassed time and again until I had to voice a complaint? Does anyone bother to read these comments? Are Etihad Airways not interested or concerned that there are so many negative comments on here?

### "poor customer service"
My wife and I purchased return flights for us and our three children to fly from Melbourne to Manchester. Subsequently I have been in contact with Etihad Airways to ask how to redeem air miles. I was told to set up an account in my name and apply to the Retro Claims Department to have the air miles credited to my account. It transpires that Etihad misinformed me and I should of set up a family account. However due to the delay in Etihad responding to my telephone calls and emails, it is now too late to set up a family account and have the air miles credited. Etihad have been extremely obstructive and very unhelpful with this matter. Etihad staff members don't even read the email trail before they reply; if they did they wouldn't be asking the obvious questions they do. Surely good customer service would be to apologise for the delay, open us a family account and credit the air miles. We will be purchasing five more return flights from Melbourne to Manchester England in 2016. We would never fly with Etihad again. The very average food and average inflight service was a deterrent but the poor customer service is the final straw and will not see us return to Etihad. I would not recommend Etihad to anyone.

### "to be woefully lacking"
EY306 Kuwait to Abu Dhabi. Despite all the hype around Etihad being one of the top-tier Gulf carriers, I was surprised to find it to be woefully lacking on this short sector of 1h 55m. There was no drinks service at all in economy. This meant that two hapless flight attendants were asked randomly by passengers for drinks. It was hard for them to remember who asked for what and where they were sitting. Why not just bring the trolley down the aisle and do a drink service so that everyone has something and it isn’t random chaos? Say what you want about the deplorable service on US and Canadian carriers, but at least they do a drink run, even on short flights on small commuter planes. Abu Dhabi is a terrible airport with almost all flights parked remotely and passengers shuttled around in buses.

### "flights were disappointing"
Abu Dhabi to Kuwait. Same as my inbound flight in the other direction whereby you cannot get a drink to save your life. What is it with Etihad Airways? Can’t they just take a trolley down the aisle and offer everyone a drink? I asked a flight attendant for one and instead of bringing it, after 15 minutes she is taking the cart down the aisle to collect garbage. The flight is about two-thirds full, so they are not exactly run off their feet. In seat AVOD didn’t work at all. Had to bear the constant broadcasting of ‘Just For Laughs’ with the inability to even turn the screen off or turn on another channel. FA had no clue how to turn the screen off either. I’m looking forward to getting back on to Qatar Airways for my travel back to the US in a few days. Both flights on Etihad Airways over the last two days were disappointing.

### "3 months with no reply"
I used to be a regular traveller with Etihad, however of late, I have become disillusioned the service has gone downhill - culminating this year, my baggage being delayed 4 times out of 6 consecutive flights. This is despite assurances on the last trip by ground staff that the luggage was on board. Last year I arrived late at Abu Dhabi from LHR to be greeted by staff telling me (at 2300) that I had been moved from my connecting flight (for which I had tickets) onto an alternative flight 5 hours later. This was after having several assurances by the onboard staff that my connection would be fine. No viable reason was given as to why I had been moved despite there were still 45 minutes before take-off, I was told that the gate for my scheduled flight was shut but when I got there they were still boarding passengers. They accepted that I was booked to fly on that flight and they had no power to change things back (this could only be done by some magical / mythical “controller” with whom I could not speak and, finally one of the staff had the audacity to tell me they could not let me board sine they had insufficient food in order to feed me. I have written to Etihad customer services on several occasions about the sorry state of their service asking for an explanation and receiving assurances that my question / situation was being looked into, I have now been waiting 3 months with no reply.

### "had run out of everything"
Flew Etihad for the third time in 3 years, from Manchester to Bangkok with a short layover in Abu Dhabi on 3 November 2015, returning on 20th November. First flight (MAN-AUH) I asked at checkin if we could have exit seats as me and my travel partner both stand over 6ft tall. Was told this was not possible unless we paid an additional £75 per flight. I expect low cost airlines to charge for exit seats, not a premium airline. Boarded the plane (A340-600) which has a 2-4-2 seat configuration. Decent seat pitch but minimal legroom. Our steward for this 7 hour flight had an appalling attitude, sulked and even refused to give us a full can of tonic water to share as the flight was full. Passenger in front of me full reclined for the full flight even when dinner was served, wasn't asked to put her seat up once. Later overheard him telling another passenger he had been bumped from a flight to the Seychelles, thus the reason for his mood. Only received one drink during this flight. Second flight (AUH-BKK) on Boeing 777-300, no real issues. Staff were friendly and courteous. Multiple drinks runs. Worth noting that this plane was half full. Seat pitch noticeably poorer with a 3-4-3 config but we were lucky that the seat between us was empty. Returning (BKK-AUH) was when the real problems started. Full flight on an A340-600. Plane was 45 minutes late leaving due to refuelling. This wouldn't have been an issue had the following 18 hours not been so spectacularly bad. Screen in front of me was omitting no sound whatsoever with my headphones or my travel partners. Made the stewardess aware of this and she said she would reset the system. 45 minutes pass and still nothing. I asked again if she would reset it and was told she had already. The screen didn't switch off once, so its impossible this had been reset. Sat for full 7 hours with no inflight entertainment. Drinks came round and again, massive shortages. Was restricted to 1 Gin and 1 Beer each. Asked for ice with my Gin and witnessed the stewardess scratching around the tub for tiny shards of ice. They had none. There was another drinks run later in the flight, if you liked tea, coffee or mango juice. They had run out of everything, including water. No water on a flight with 300 people on board. Last flight after a 4-5 hour layover in AUH was to Manchester. Flight left half full again, on a Boeing 777-300 on overnight flight. My plan was to sleep most of the journey. I went to sleep around 90 minutes into the flight, with my seatbelt on as not to be disturbed clearly visible. I was awoken maybe half an hour later by the stewardess who jabbed her finger into my chest multiple times asking me if I had my seatbelt on (lights had come on). I looked down and saw it was clearly visible and fastened. She scuttled off down the aisle embarrassed. Meanwhile my travel partner next to me is sat there asleep with no seatbelt on! We were left well alone after this and I was allowed to sleep. A completely embarrassing performance highlighted when I sent a tweet to Etihad asking if they wanted my feedback for my recent flight. They immediately blocked me. Truly pathetic. Spend the extra money and fly Emirates, Qatar or Turkish. If Etihad flights are full they are a dreadful consumer experience, worst I've ever endured.

### "food is dreadful"
Kuala Lumpur to London via Abu Dhabi. This is the first time flying with Etihad and I relied on their advertising, showing how many awards won, airline of the year etc. On that basis I assumed they would be on a par with other Middle East Airlines (Qatar, Emirates) who I have flown and found very acceptable, especially Qatar. I can honestly say this is the worst overall experience I have had. From this 1 flight I have written to their customer service to report 3 very different incidents, I have not received 1 response! (except automated reply stating I would receive a follow up from representative, we value you as a customer blah blah). The one simple issue to illustrate how poor they are is they have not credited my air miles (including an offer of 5000 miles to compensate a cancelled flight!) for these flights, I have written to them 3 times and received no response - this appears to be their normal procedure judging from other reviews. Obviously not receiving air miles would not constitute a bad experience on its own, but this was just to illustrate just how little they care. The crew are dysfunctional, they do not operate at all as a team. Their service is sloppy and carefree and not at all professional. The food is dreadful, tiny portions and uninspiring, I get much better food and choice on my local budget airline, Air Asia. I am not tall by any stretch of the imagination and the seat squab only came half way up my thigh on A380, the other aircraft (not sure - A340?) was at least normal in this respect. They boast about the suites on the A380 and I guess this is solely to satisfy their mega rich local customers - when it comes to economy they really don't care. Ground service and the way a cancelled flight was dealt with wasn't any better, updates were not the truth, it seemed staff were disorganised even though there were a lot of them, vouchers and information about breakfasts seemed to be handed out on a 1 by 1 basis and not told to everyone.

### "felt like a budget airline flight"
London Heathrow to Abu Dhabi. The A380 was great, but that was all that was impressive about this flight. The plane being new and cutting edge, sold itself. The service was at best, mediocre and the cabin crew showed their lack of experience in confusion and getting mixed up. With a ‘light’ flight, there seemed more a gossip and snacking culture rather than a commitment to looking after their ‘guests’. I had pre-ordered AVML, but was told I should have the veg pasta on the menu, which I did. Then they discovered that the AVML was in the oven, so I agreed to try it out. The AVML was awful! It was as bad as a hospital meal, bland, tasteless, half cooked and not at all AVML. More like kosher or post recuperation food served by nursing staff. The crew apologised for not having AUH landing cards on board – another example of Etihad Airways lack of organisation. Had it been a full flight, I am sure utter mix ups and confusion would have prevailed. The cabin crew did the minimum work and apart from the ambience of the new A380, this one really felt like a budget airline flight. Abu Dhabi to Delhi was a one-off experience! Long queues prevailed at the gate as staff was not able to handle the various combinations of passports, visas and baggage. The process was extremely slow with officials running around, and when we were bundled off the buses onto the aircraft, a compact A320, the cabin crew were not able to handle the seating of passengers, who were allowed to freely roam, change seats, bunch together, shout across the aisles at each other – in chaos. The cleanliness of the aircraft also left something to be desired as one could clearly see grease on windows and unprepared seat pockets (litter in torn literature, left over chewing gum etc.). My seat cushion kept on slipping away forwards, coming off the seat frame. Its Velcro had seen better days. The cover on the seat cushion also came off – a thoroughly uncomfortable situation throughout the flight. Once airborne, Etihad chose to serve dinner. The choice is clearly yours, but at 3:30am (AUH) (4:30am DEL), would it not have been better to have served a substantial snack or a light breakfast rather than dinner, serving which was an ordeal for all in cramped cabin space on this plane. My meal was once again comic. The Serbian hostess told me that they had run out of the veg option, so she ‘could offer me lamb or chicken’. She obviously had no idea! What was the point proudly distributing the menu? I was served flat Coca Cola out of the last remains of a bottle of Coke and she insisted it was ‘fresh’ and not ‘flat’ as it sure was. When I said that I had pre-ordered AVML, she said that might be in the front galley. When the trolley service finished ten minutes later, I was half way through rice salad, bread and Coke, the ‘special’ meal arrived. It was OVML and had clearly been opened previously – I thought it may have even been from another discarded tray! The most uninviting chow mein in it was clearly not my request. Putting Serbian and Swahili speaking staff on a AUH-DEL flight where passengers are likely to be 90% Indian, puts unnecessary stress on the crew despite their brave ‘plastic smiles’, and doesn’t help anyone on the flight.

### "customer service been dreadful"
Jeddah to Bangkok via Abu Dhabi with Etihad Airways. Undoubtedly the worst ever check-in I have experienced anywhere in the world. Due to some technical issue relating to the check-in computers which was not conveyed to the passengers, it took 4.5 hours to check everyone in; the check-in procedure required pushing, shoving, shouting and general aggravation as no barriers were erected to facilitate fair queueing. I have never in my life watch passengers carrying their baggage over their head, barge to the front of the queue, shout, get angry and then achieve their desire in such an outrageous way. To see the Etihad staff shout and abuse some passengers was also totally unacceptable; quite clearly they could not cope. I was virtually the last person on the plane which was delayed for 2.5 hours and as such missed my onward connection in Abu Dhabi resulting in a 9 hour stay at the Airport Premier Inn and missing my first night in my Bangkok Hotel for which I paid around USD100 which has still not been reimbursed. The customer service has been dreadful since my emails and forms to the Etihad system were ignored. Eventually I received 20,000 air miles after writing to the boss and an apology. 20,000 airmiles are not the same as flying 20,000 miles in the air mind you. I have made some enquiries and believe I will receive a small discount if I fly this route with them again; I also receive junk mail from Etihad Airways now as well which I don't like. The flights themselves were okay but the seats are too narrow and the leg room is poor. IFE is okay but not as good as other middle-eastern carriers - too many US English films.

### "A380 is a fantastic plane"
Bangkok to Abu Dhabi with Etihad Airways. No problems with the service on the flight. Good entertainment system, food was okay. Seat pitch was reasonable for someone with long legs. Returning from Abu Dhabi to London Heathrow the A380 is a fantastic plane. Comfortable seats and large screen. Service was good, and the food was okay.

### "Crew and food were good"
Originally booked on EY2 connecting to EY 402 on 6th of November. Left Frankfurt late and due to a short connection I was informed by the crew that they rebooked me on EY 406. Friendly crew on EY2 and the dinner I chose was one of the best economy dishes I ever had. Seat was ok for me (21H) - as comfortable or unconfortable as other economy seats. Upon arrival in Abu Dhabi I was met by EY staff at the gate and given my new ticket to EY 406 incl an upgrade to business class. Time loss was about 2 hours which did not bother me to much because I would have not been able to check in my hotel room anyways. Original arrival 6:35 am arrived 9:05 am. Crew and food were good on this flight. Arrival in Bangkok - well my luggage was lost. That made me a little angry. First they knew on the first leg that I would not make my connection - they have the luggage tag numbers and did not manage to get the luggage to 406 in time although there was about 2 hours of transfer time. I think that was poor service. It was after midnight when my suitcase showed finally up in Pattaya.

### "onboard service was bad"
A very poor experience overall. There was chaos in Abu Dhabi. Since US immigration is cleared in AUH, I was told to go to the gate 2 hrs prior and assured that the lounge next to gate is comparable to the main Etihad Airways lounge. This was a lie. The lounge near the gate (you can't exit and return to the big lounge) is pathetic. Hardly enough seating, no smoking area, no alcoholic drinks and not enough snacks. The onboard service was bad to say the least. No night suit was given. When I asked for it, they give it after two reminders, and one crew told me they were under instructions not to give it out unless pressed for. Drinks were never refilled without asking and then done grudgingly. An old aircraft that was falling apart - eg. no holder for soap so the entire flight the soap was dripping on the counter. There was no water in one bathroom and instead of shutting it down, the crew handed me a bottle of water for use in there! Food was poor (special meal Asian Veg) and looked similar to budget airline paid meal.

### "seats seemed okay"
Perth to New York via Abu Dhabi, and in my experience the service was attentive. The food, while not fabulous, was adequate and snacks (crackers, nuts and apple slices) were offered on several occasions, as well as water. The seats seemed okay, pretty average for economy, and the entertainment system was first class. All flights were on time. This was my experience on 2 occasions in October 2015. It appeared pretty routine for this airline's procedures.

### "exceeded my expectation"
I recently flew with Etihad Airways from Abu Dhabi to Bangkok return and they exceeded my expectation. Boeing 777 very clean and tidy, toilets clean through the flight and restocked. From boarding until the disimbarkation staff were in the cabin, very kind and helpful. Great service and excellent food and beverage choice. Inflight entertainment system was fantastic. I would strongly recommend to fly with them.

### "the worst journey"
Brisbane to Athens via Abu Dhabi with Etihad Airways was the worst journey of my life. My daughter, a size 12, managed to squeeze into the seat. I'm an 18 and so not comfortable. Food and service poor. Half a cup of tea/wine, then staff went, never to return. The same meal on both flights. On the return trip, we paid extra to sit in exit seats. Not happy to find most of them empty, and the man sat next to me, had just moved himself up from a seat at the back! The one upside, was the man at Athens Airport, who arranged my upgrade, was wonderful, and the lady he sent me to see to pay for my upgrade was also brilliant. I have done a lot of long haul flights, and I can honestly say the plane and the service were the worst I have had.

### "horrible checking in"
Horrible experience checking in, and staff was extremely rude. I had only one bag for check-in (18kg) and carry-on was 8kg, and I was asked to check the carry-on as well. I was told that it was too big, even though the bag was approved size. Was told they don't give two hoots to approved size. I asked it to be measured, but was refused and when I put it in the bag sizer the dimensions were fine. Instead of apologizing, the service rep started talking in a very unfriendly manner. On the way out I asked to have a word with the supervisor, who refused to talk saying he is too busy.

### Etihad Airways customer review
London to Manila via Abu Dhabi. Outbound leg to Abu Dhabi was fine, A380 is very pleasent. Quiet cabin, leg room ok, entertainment system great although films not as up to date as expected. Food reasonable and cabin crew excellent. Abu Dhabi to Manila on an older Boeing 777 so the entertainment system was a little more dated but ok, food and crew excellent. Return leg from Manila to Abu Dhabi was cancelled but put up in a nice hotel and kept reasonably well informed of when the return flight was going to be. I can't fault Etihad for a situation outside of their control. The only minor thing would be that luggage was not returned when it became obvious that the delay was going to be a long one.

### "seat and leg space good"
New York to Kolkata via Abu Dhabi return with Etihad Airways. Its a long trip, close to 19 hours of flying time. During this trip I traveled on Etihad's Boeing 777 and A320 aircraft which looked clean and well maintained. I felt that the seat and leg space were good compared to similar aircraft of other airlines. I am 6'1" tall and could stretch my legs. Food is below average and not great. Also the Inflight Entertainment system (EBOX) lacks collection. Their coffee was also so bad.

### "won't fly with them again"
Brisbane to Istanbul via Abu Dhabi with Etihad Airways. Aircraft were okay, but check in at Brisbane 4 lanes open for business class and first class with no one in queue, and 3 lanes open for the 200 people waiting in economy. Eventually they changed one of the business class check ins to economy. As for the service on the plane after a meal is served all cabin crew vanish. Don't know how they win awards, I won't fly with them again.

### "lots of room and privacy"
Sydney to Rome via Abu Dhabi. Etihad Airways Business class seats provide lots of room and privacy, I was in 18A - one problem is that this seat is right next to toilet so if you plan on sleeping don't get this seat. I also noted that due to the size of the business class the staff were not as available as other companies. Another negative is the bus trips between the gate and plane in Abu Dhabi is terribly hot and crowded and no bus for business class - they just squeeze as many as possible in the busses. I was impressed with the diversity of the crew, the bar is great and champagne went down well. The wifi was cheap and worked.

### "flight average and food good"
This is my first time on Etihad Airways travelling from Kuala Lumpur to Istanbul via Abu Dhabi and Belgrade. First flight from KUL to AUH average and food good, lots of people in that flight. Layover at AUH about 3 hours and i have to walk about 15 minutes from Terminal 1 to Terminal 3 for my next fligt to BEG, while the aircraft is at Terminal 1. Really annoyed me when the bus took me back to Terminal 1 area. Abu Dhabi Airport really need to improved their system of Airtraffic Control.

### "seat comfort was good"
First time on Etihad travelling from Brisbane to Manchester return via Abu Dhabi and having travelled this route several times over the years Etihad has to be one of my favourites. Flight schedules are important to adjust to the time zones and both flights were spot on, seat comfort was good, a blanket and a pillow provided, IFE good with a variety of movies, Live sport and news, games and internet access (I did not use). FA's from several countries, excellent bringing water and snacks in between meals. The meals were ok - nothing special but adequate. Delay information was provided by the flight crew. The aircraft were clean and well presented you can tell the quietness on the Boeing 787. Transit through Abu Dhabi no problem much easier than through Dubai. Overall a great experience, if they keep the schedule out of Brisbane and Manchester I would travel with Etihad again.

### "the food was mediocre"
I was excited to be travelling on this aircraft, however, I was so disappointed with the service provided. I was sitting in seat 69K alongside my partner. The aircraft appeared fully booked. There was a problem in zone 4 where I was sat whereby it appeared a family consisting of mother, father and 3 small children did not have their seats together and mum was pleading with the flight attendant to sort this out. The male attendant was doing his best however, on the arrival of the senior flight attendant who spoke to all of the passengers in the area and said, "can we all work together to sort this out. I'm looking for two passengers to move seats to accommodate the family". When a passenger asked if there would be an upgrade, she said, "No - on the same economy class". No one appeared to offer at this stage, so she then became quite hostile and then said, "Ok if no-one is prepared to move, then the flight will be delayed" and she walked away from the whole situation. I was appalled by her behaviour. It was as if she was a child having a tantrum. I believe that this problem should have been sorted out by the staff from Etihad and not speak to the passengers in the manner in which she did. There was also an other flight attendant throughout the journey who served food in the aisle which I was sitting, this flight attendant demanded, rather than ask, that the blinds be lowered. Not what I would expect from flight attendants. The food was mediocre. Inflight entertainment was not great as there were not many new films - a lot of older films. Once we reached Heathrow, it took an eternity for the stairs to be attached to the aircraft and it took at least twenty minutes for passengers to alight from the aircraft. I would not travel with Etihad Airways again.

### "seats are an absolute disgrace"
The seats are an absolute disgrace, it is like sitting on concrete. I endured this for 14 hours and purchased an extra legroom seat only to be thoroughly disappointed, I even put my head cushion and blanket underneath to help but it proved fruitless. I then got on a Virgin Australia flight for my last leg from Sydney to Auckland for three hours on a Boeing 737-800 and the seats were much more padded and comfortable.

### "crew could be hit or miss"
Many things could be said about Etihad experience, and memorable is definitely one of them. I flew round trip AUH-DUB-AUH and the subpar experience started from Abu Dhabi Airport, the fact that most of the airport is still under major renovation and construction alone does not justify the cost of the ticket Etihad charges. Let's start with check-in, the online check in can only be done via website as there is no app that would do it for you (EK or QR have great apps, for example), therefore, there is no such a thing as an online boarding pass integrated into the passbook of the phone. Here are the positive points about the ground service at AUH: Escort service could be provided to sort out the documents and immigration. The Premium Lounge is indeed very nice, albeit not many options for the buffet. Negatives about the ground service at AUH: Being bussed to the aircraft is not luxurious however you try to market it. The Airport is just horrendous The in-flight experience AUH-DUB: Lovely food, I loved the option of eating whenever I chose to. Lovely options for beverages. Crew could be hit or miss. On both legs of my journey, some crew were nice and others were not so great. One of the crew even went as far as to lie: "Captain just informed me we were above Ankara. I later found out we never got close to Turkey, which left me puzzled. The reason I had this conversation in the first place was the fact that E-BOX did not work properly and had no flight information. Ground services at DUB: The check in was the same as in AUH. Nothing great. The Airport is wonderful and a joy to go through. The lounge was wonderful too. Great ambience, quiet with attentive staff. In-flight experience DUB-AUH: One word, horrible. No drink was offered to me and my colleague simply because the crew never passed by our side of the cabin. Amenity kit was used by someone else, and I had to ask for a new one. I had to ask for my glass of champagne 3 times, which thankfully arrived 30 minutes after take off. Some meals were not available. I was not asked when I would like to have my food, nor was I asked for my preference of drinks. The food arrived with still water (not ordered by me), the wine I had asked for was not served either. When I asked for sparkling water, the guy just poured some into my half empty glass of still water. No questions asked. Cheese selections consisted of one type of cheese decorated with fruits and berries. The name should be changed to "Fruit section with added cheese" The overall feel was as if I had to beg for the service that is supposed to be provided. The cabin had also not been cleaned well as I found a crushed dry bread loaf under my seat, which thoroughly covered the floor under my feet for the remainder of the flight. Overall, I would not recommend flying Business Class with Etihad as it is simply not worth the money. From the moment you book the ticket, you are in for a ride.The most thing I liked about my experience was the consistent and high-speed internet connection that is reasonably priced.

### "wi-fi works like a charm"
Flew Etihad Business from LAX-AUH-BOM while going, and DEL-AUH-LAX while returning. B777-200 was used on round-trip between LAX and AUH. The AUH to BOM route was served by A340-600, and DEL-AUH by A330-200. My two favorite aspects of flying Etihad Business: 1) Personal Food and Beverage Manager. 2) Lie-Flat bed. The food is "restaurant-quality", and you can order anything from the menu at any time. The cabin service on all routes was excellent. In A340-600 and A330-200, there was no overhead compartment in Business Class to stow luggage for passengers in the middle seats (B777-200 doesn't have this problem). The wi-fi on Etihad works like a charm. Etihad's Business Lounge in Abu Dhabi has something for everyone when it comes to dining. Having said that, the operations at Etihad's Abu Dhabi terminal are far from perfect for transit passengers. So, if you can look past the hiccups at Abu Dhabi Airport, flying Etihad Business Class is a special experience.

### "service in business gone down"
Bangkok to Manchester via Abu Dhabi. I have flown Etihad Airways many times and noticed that service in business has gone down. Flight attendants failed to offer me a pre flight drink and seemed uninterested. The seats in business are worn and narrow and at 1m 89cm you just can't sleep. For some reason the air quality is poor and I come away from the flight with a runny nose and feeling off colour. Food was good, Inflight entertainment is poor with a limited selection of old and new movies. Compared to other offerings e-box is second rate.

### "seats narrow and uncomfortable"
Rome to Sydney via Abu Dhabi on Etihad Airways. The flight attendants were  inattentive,  seats the most narrow and uncomfortable I have sat on, whilst the aisles are dangerously narrow (I'm shocked it is legal to have aisles that narrow). I had pre-ordered special meals for flights on all legs of my return trip and did not receive one of them - luckily there were vegetarian options on each leg. The toilets were were probably cleaned once on the 14 hour leg from AB to Sydney. The in-flight entertainment system is lacking in variety and quality, not close to Singapore Airlines' entertainment system. If you are flying from Australia to Europe, do yourself a favour and fly another airline!

### "seem to have gone off the boil"
Etihad Airways seem to have gone off the boil. Pretty much the first business class passenger on and the last one to get offered a drink. Was right at the back of business class and was kept awake/disturbed the majority of the flight by a screaming child. As we were entering the gate someone in front of me got upgraded to Business and managed to get a seat at the front of business class - about 12 rows away from screaming child. First world problem? Maybe? I know I sound like a snob (I guess I am one) but I do think that kids should be at the back of the plane. If I pay a premium for a seat I think I'm entitled to an overall better service. I was detained coming out of UAE as there was a problem with my passport. Etihad ground crew had updated my itinerary with my UK passport which showed I didn't have right of entry to Australia. I have 2 passports. Let me tell you I did have 15 mins of worry - unnecessarily. They need to sharpen up their act. it's the attention to detail that counts and that was just sadly lacking.

### "I feel extremely annoyed"
Doha to Manila via Abu Dhabi. After realising that there was a title error on my Etihad Airways ticket, which was under MRS and should have been MR, I was shocked to find out that in order to change the title a 75 USD charge will apply. I could not believe that a title mistake could cost so much, I would understand 10 USD, but 75 USD is a complete scam. I feel extremely annoyed with this penalty. I relucantly made the change and paid as I do not want any issues when I fly. Is this really allowed for such a small change of details, this was not a flight change, just a title!

### "very pleasant experience"
Frankfurt to Bangkok via Abu Dhabi, and I had a very pleasant experience with Etihad. From check in to being greeted in the business lounge. Boarded the flight and found myself upgraded to first class. Onward flight to Bangkok again wonderful service. Return journey was also pleasant and enjoyable. Lovely staff both on ground and air with everything ok. Food on all sectors was great.

### "Etihad does not care"
Etihad Airways sends an email at 5:18am about a change in our flight. Our flight was originally at 10:45 pm but got changed to 5:15am. Why couldn't they have let us known earlier. Are they that incompetent? What do they expect us to do with less than 12 hrs before departure. When I called to see what they could do all I got was a non-caring shrug and "sorry, we can't do anything please speak to a representative when you land in Abu Dhabi". I mean not even an offer to cover any additional costs that I will be incurring due to their fault. Now I am stuck scrambling to get new flights to my connecting destination. Etihad does not care for their passengers. Thanks for all the stress, Etihad.

### "food choices not available"
Edinburgh to Phuket via Abu Dhabi return with Etihad Airways. On both flights coming and going on holiday, all food choices offered on menus were not available with only the less desirable food on offer. Many comments were made about this on board. Seating not particularly spacious for long haul flights and interaction between staff not very impressive with distinct feeling of disinterest to be helpful with each other noted on two occasions. Luggage went on to Australia instead of Phuket holiday destination, but was delivered to holiday address later that day.

### "problem was in the return"
I flew Etihad Airways  from Madrid to Phuket via Abu Dhabi. Although the plane was OK and the services seemed average, the problem was in the return. I tried to do the check-in online, even called the call center 10 times because I couldn't do it online and still they told me to do it at the airport in the 1 hour scale I had in Abu Dhabi. When I arrived to Abu Dhabi I had overbooking, had to take another flight and make another stop, and obviously arrived late to Madrid. When I arrived they had lost my luggage and sent it to me 2 days after. The "compensasion" they gave me is a voucher who I can just use in Etihad Airways flights with 1 million conditions I will never have, and obviously implies spending another 1000 euro in their company. Nobody answers my complains and they don't even have a number for it. I'd think twice if you are about to book with this airline.

### "need to make improvements"
Athens to Manila via Abu Dhabi with Etihad Airways. Athens to Abu Dhabi my cabin was economy class. Air hostess was cold polite and most of times their behavior become rude. They don’t pay so much attention to serve passenger correctly. From Abu Dhabi to Manila, I was upgraded (paying a very logical amount) to business class. Business class lounge was very convenient, clean, and the food was really nice with a lot of choices. Onboard my the cabin staff serving me was very polite but I had the feeling that he did not understand me well when I ask for something. Food was not in business class level, plus he forgot to serve me the main course dish (tenderloin beef). When realize that was too late. Etihad need to make more improvements, competition is very hard.

### "luggage didn't arrive in Athens "
Melbourne to Athens via Abu Dhabi. On the first leg between Melbourne and Abu Dhabi one of the entertainment systems froze about 2 hours into the flight and no one was able to reset the screen for the whole flight. The luggage didn't arrive in Athens despite a 3 hour stopover in Abu Dhabi, so had to waste the afternoon waiting for luggage which arrived the next evening around 7:00pm. Tried ringing Virgin Australia as it was a codeshare but they were unable to help or call Abu Dhabi, but did give me a number to ring. On the Abu Dhabi Athens leg were told the bar had closed when trying to order a ginger beer, but noticed drinks continued to be delivered to other passengers? Luggage finally arrives and one suitcase was damaged.

### "an average experience"
San Francisco to Delhi via Abu Dhabi on Etihad Airways for the first time. It was an average experience. Flying time and layover time was the shortest for the route I flew. Abu Dhabi airport is unimpressive. Food above average, service average. Inflight entertainment was average. Seats were cramped and uncomfortable for a long haul flight. Ground service at New Delhi airport was terrible. They missed the one bag I checked in. Understaffed ground service crew took 90 minutes to finally document a missing bag report before I could leave. There were no follow up calls, it was impossible to get through every time I called. Finally got it 3 days after landing but the ground staff were poorly trained and highly unprofessional. Overall I would say Emirates is better in every respect. Etihad is cheaper but you get what you pay for.

### "cabin staff friendly"
Sydney to Abu Dhabi on Etihad Airways A380. Cabin staff friendly. I'm a nervous flyer so having space, the ability to lie flat, large screens and noise cancelling headphone all helped make the trip more enjoyable.

### "cabin crew seemed unmotivated"
Amsterdam to Abu Dhabi with Etihad Airways. the seats are small and cabin crew seemed unmotivated throughout the flight. Very poor quality customer service generally. Bags damaged beyond repair and still waiting 8 weeks for a response. The airline advertises 'deals' and 'sales' but check before booking during these times. I have found on two occasions that regular ticket prices were actually cheaper than the 'specials' they promote.

### "seats are woefully small"
For the price we paid the seats are woefully small. The fact they seemed to have overbooked the flight and the poor attitude of the staff will never encourage me to come back to this airline. The food is rubbish for such long haul flights and we had to get rid of our water before boarding (due to Australian rules) but we had no way of getting enough water onboard, and when we asked for more, the staff were very resentful of us asking. In the departure lounge, there were no announcements and procedures were very confusing without any direction. The inflight entertainment system had hardly changed since the flight that brought us to Abu Dhabi, 7 weeks prior.

### "let down by  Jet Airways aircraft"
Etihad Airways offer excellent business class service, but good experience was let down by use of a Jet Airways configured aircraft on the AUH-JNB-AUH sectors. The seats are all aisle facing so had a nice view of the opposite passengers bare feet and tv screen. The seats are narrow and very cramped with no storage space around. The crew struggled with the tray tables and tv screens. The seats went into the sleep position with ease but if you turned over you knocked your knees and elbows on the partition walls. Would travel with Etihad again but only on their own aircraft as my LCA-AUH-LCA sectors offered more space and comfort.

### "aisles were very narrow"
Dhaka to New York via Abu Dhabi with Etihad Airways. The food was sub-par, the aisles were very narrow to allow passengers to bring our bags, and the seats very uncomfortable. Unfortunately while boarding in Dhaka, none of the flight staff in the plane speak any Bengali. Although the politeness of the cabin staff and entertainment were positive.

### "fine, yet uncomfortable journey"
We flew Athens to Melbourne via Abu Dhabi with Etihad Airways. Athens to Abu Dhabi was great, smooth check in and we were given the emergency exit row seats. The meals were tasty. We had an 8 hour stop over in Abu Dhabi and was not happy with the service there. Before we had gotten on the plane they searched our bags and made us throw all liquid out (even though we had already done this in customs). This meant entering the flight without anything to drink. For a 14 hour flight I like to stay hydrated so this was extremely frustrating. After take off I asked for a bottle of water. I was told I couldn't have one, I could only have a plastic cup that they filled a quarter of the way with water. Apart from our drinks with meals this was all we got. I rang the service bell and waited 1/2 an hour and got no reply even after pressing twice. I had to walk down the other end of the plane just to get another tiny cup of water. For 14 hours on a plane this is ridiculous and for the amount of money you pay for a ticket I would think you could at least be given adequate amounts of water. The flight went smoothly, although meals were rushed towards the end of the flight (don't know why though we had 14 hours to prepare for them) it was a fine, yet uncomfortable journey.

### "quality of service in the flight"
I flew Etihad Airways from Sydney to Abu Dhabi return by A380. I was amazed at the quality of service in the flight, food servings, IFE etc. But with the current state of Abu Dhabi airport (with jam packed terminal, unclean washrooms), it would be quite an achievement for Etihad Airways to get repeated customers, especially in economy class.

### "either completely incapable "
I booked an Etihad Airways flight through the Air Berlin homepage for my wife from Tokyo Narita to Dusseldorf via Abu Dhabi. And-to my utter surprise, they did it again. They completely messed it up. Hard to believe, but they did. It reminded me of last year when my wife was booked on the exactly same flight out of Narita and arrived 3 days after the scheduled arrival date in Dusseldorf. This time, during check-in my wife was told nonchalantly by the Narita Etihad Airways ground staff that although her flight data is stored in the Etihad system it cannot be found in the Air Berlin system. In other words: they will not let her take that plane for the simple reason that the link between the Air Berlin system and the Etihad system is missing. One of the staff told her that this sometimes happens and that she should call Air Berlin. What, are you kidding me? Anyway she called them and the Air Berlin call center staff told her that everything is fine and that maybe she checked in too early. Well it wasn’t ok and the Etihad Airways ground staff continued refusing to hand out a boarding ticket. Maybe one day I will write a book about what a lousy company Etihad is (if anybody hasn’t noticed yet). My wife had to listen to their Narita ground staff and later she was issued a temporary Ticket and had the privilege to board the plane for which I had already paid, after they let her wait for three hours. Last time when this happened I thought they are just a bunch of losers, but by now I think they are either completely incapable or they are doing this intentionally. Later my wife was told that she will have to check that the return flight on Saturday 10th is correctly listed in the Etihad Airways / Air Berlin system otherwise she will not be able to fly home.

### "the leg room was cramped"
Flew with Etihad Airways from London Heathrow to Abu Dhabi yesterday and it was one of the worst airlines I have travelled with. It was their first flight of the day out of Heathrow but was subject to a 2hr delay without explanation or apology. The staff were not very apologetic and the leg room was cramped. The food choices were awful and the wine selection cheap and nasty with only a medium dry white on offer : no dry white, rose or sparkling were available. The onboard entertainment was dated. To finish our experience we waited ages for luggage to arrive on the carousel. All in all a very poor experience and one we would not wish to repeat, but we have to fly back with them on Sunday

### "tried to freeze us"
The Abu Dhabi to Jakarta flight with Etihad Airways would have been okay if it weren't for the fact that they have tried to freeze us. All part of a cunning plan no doubt. Frozen people are unlikely to be demanding of the service. My feet have lost any sensation of being attached to my body, and my nose has a rough idea of what frostbite feels like. Absurd temperature!

### "crew attentive and friendly"
An 8 hour flight from Abu Dhabi to Kuala Lumpur with Etihad Airways. left an hour and a half late due to heavy traffic and then a passenger falling ill. Never easy waiting so long to depart, but the cabin was nice and cool. Seated in something like 38C with an empty seat beside me. The service was excellent, crew were attentive and friendly, the Bloody Mary was made with Tabasco and Worcester. The dinner was okay, though the chicken rendang had run out and only the fish and vegetarian noodles were available. Who would have thought, that the chicken would be more popular than the fish? Seat was comfortable, the inflight entertainment had a decent variety of shows. It's a decent airline, and they fly A380s. Abu Dhabi is a bit dated, but looks like a new terminal is appearing. Had to take a bus out to plane, it's a bit third world.

### "plane was dirty and old"
The Etihad Airways flight from New York JFK to Abu Dhabi (EY 100) was on a Jet Airways aircraft! Please be aware of this. I did not know and purchased a return flight from SIN-JFK and spent $1600 on a flight expecting to have excellent service and aircraft but was extremely disappointed. I only found out that I was flying a Jet Airways aircraft when I boarded the plane and would not have purchased this flight if I knew. The plane was dirty and old, it looked like it was from 1970 and had horrible red carpeting and old seats. The food was terrible too. It was Indian food, which I dont mind, but I had no idea what was on the menu. Even the steward did not know what it was. What was most upsetting is that Etihad Airways claims that it is an Etihad Airways aircraft. Everything, from the check in counter, to the boarding pass to some of the stewards are Etihad Airways, so they claim it is an Etihad Airways flight, which is not so. I would not have minded as much if they were clear and transparent that I would be flying a Jet Airways plane. I feel cheated and that's why I am writing a review. If you are flying the EY100 do not take it. Please make sure that you check with the airline before you book your flights as Etihad Airways is not explicit about what aircraft you will be taking. You dont want to be in for a bad surprise on a 14 hour flight.

### "she said wake them up "
This was my first time Etihad Airways, flying from New York to Abu Dhabi. Things seemed fine for the first couple of hours then about 6 hours into the flight, the person sitting next to my daughter got sick and threw up all over. My daughter had it on her blanket which saved her clothes, the armrest and seat she was sitting in. The smell was horrible. We rang for the stewardess from 3 different places and no one showed until the gentleman in front of us went to get someone. A stewardess came and tried to clean it up but she too was getting sick, so she said I will put a blanket over the seat and then you can sit. We refused to sit on vomit. She told me to go find another seat. I looked but most of the plane was asleep and you could not see where there were any empty seats. I told her people were asleep and she said "wake them up". I said no, you wake them up it is your job. This was a very special trip my daughter and I, planned as we never had the opportunity to do a mother daughter trip before. Now we could not even sit near each other for the remainder of the trip. It was a nightmare.

### "extremely disappointed"
Kuala Lumpur to London via Abu Dhabi, and extremely disappointed. Was expecting a lot more, thought it would be on similar level to Qatar Airways or Emirates - how wrong. At one point crew sat on the floor in the aisle and on each other's laps in passenger seat when seat belt sign came on, surely not standard procedure! I am sat writing this in Abu Dhabi as the connecting flight has been delayed at least 5 hours - I guess it will be more as the aircraft needs to be changed and its an A380. Everything is very mediocre except perhaps entertainment system. I was hit a number of times with the trolley and so were others by same crew who also threw my drink onto the table like she was in a western movie! Same staff also threw a packet of chocolate straight onto passenger because she was so clumsy. I will never use again and not recommend to others

### "did not answer to our e-mails"
Etihad Airways canceled our flight from Kuala Lumpur to Belgrade (via Abu Dhabi) and offered us to pick one of the two flights of which the first one is 7 hrs before (and we can't make it as we'll be in Bali at the time), the other one is 22 hrs after the original one which means we need to take an extra day off and pay for the hotel. They did not bother answering to our e-mails and the customer support literally told us off.

### "chaotic boarding experience"
We flew Etihad Airways for the first time from New York to Singapore via Abu Dhabi. The boarding gate was totally unorganized and staff rude, treating people like herds of sheep. We have never had a more chaotic boarding experience than this. The plane was unkept with broken seat pockets and video screen. The flight Abu Dhabi to Singapore was good with courteous staff. Flight back from Singapore to Abu Dhabi was another horror. Boarding was again unorganized and chaotic. Pronunciations weren't clear and people were boarding without zones being announced. The stewardess on the flight from Abu Dhabi to NYC didn't even have basic soft drinks to serve. Food was plain but I am not complaining about it. It was the crew and the planes which caused our experience with this airline to be a bad one. Etihad Airways has not even responded to my email sent a week back.

### "food and staff service excellent"
Etihad Airways from Chennai to Abu Dhabi. Check in quick and efficient. As this flight was mostly used by passengers who travel further ahead (UK/USA/Europe), I was told to pay for the 3rd baggage (although I was travelling only up to Abu Dhabi). I had to show the email from Etihad airways where it was clearly highlighted that only weight limits of 30 kg is applicable for ISC to GCC flights and 2 number of bags concept to other sectors is applicable (ISC to UK/USA via Abu Dhabi)). Seat, inflight entertainment, food and staff service excellent. Customs and Immigration clearance was quick. The not so encouraging aspect was waiting time for the baggage, and it took more than 45 minutes for the baggage to arrive. I did not use the Wi Fi service.

### "seat room was limited for a tall guy"
Etihad Airways occupy the middle ground between what it does well, and what it doesn't do so well. Before booking my flight to Hong Kong from Manchester (with a 2 hour stop over in Abu Dhabi), I researched Etihad Airways on here and I was surprised by the luke-warm and even negative, response. But having travelled with them, they are understandable reviews. Leaving Manchester, the aircraft was late boarding, and late taking off - due to the fact that the plane arrived later from its previous journey. It was a farce when queuing. Most airlines wait for clear space before allowing you to go through the gate, down the ramp and enter the aircraft. Etihad, however, started checking boarding passes well before the aircraft was ready, meaning we had a 25 minutes wait inside the airplane access ramp, waiting while the stewardesses finished off their preparations and loaded the disabled passengers. Perhaps we could have waited in the lounge? On the flight, those at the back of the cabin soon found that they ran out of food options - the chicken was the first to go. That said it was the best airline food I have had. Seat room was limited for a tall guy like myself, but not too restrictive. However, when people in from of you recline your seats, you have no other option but to do the same yourself, such is the lack of space. Most of the films are not new, and there is a limited range of choices. With the Milan fashion week coming up at the time of departure, the airline (a sponsor) had presented the in-flight entertainment along the theme of fashion. Most films were based around that theme. I would prefer just a bunch of movies where I can control the theme of what I watch. Finding your way around Abu Dhabi Airport is fairly straightforward, clearly laid out and information desks if you get stuck. From Abu Dhabi to Hong Kong, there was not much support for the Chinese speaking passengers on the flight. The menu,and the entertainment system, was in English or Arabic, with little for Chinese. In the end, being a basic speaker myself, I ended up translating the menu for a group of around 25 Chinese people. I would not call Etihad a 'top airline' as they claim, especially not for Economy travellers, where airlines like Virgin and Cathay Pacific do a better job on the same route. However, it was not my worst flight ever. I would recommend this airline for the food (if they have the options when you get it), as I thoroughly enjoyed it.

### " most uncomfortable long haul economy seat"
I usually fly Malaysia Airlines when flying between Europe and Australia, but this time found a really good deal with Etihad Airways so decided to give them a try for my flight from Milan to Melbourne via Abu Dhabi. When I went to the check in counter in Milan Malpensa I was asked if I'd changed my flight date from September to April 2016. I told them I hadn't, and after 20 minutes of grumbling between check in staff, I was allocated a seat that they told me was an emergency exit seat. When I boarded the plane it turned out that I'd been given a middle aisle seat, despite there being empty emergency exit seats. On transfer in Abu Dhabi to the new plane it turned out I had again been allocated a middle seat between the window and the aisle. This seat is by far the most uncomfortable long haul economy seat I've ever had the displeasure of sitting in! Incredibly narrow, even for me (I am not a wide guy! ), and with shocking legroom. When the passenger in front of me moved their seat back I literally couldn't move! On the positive side, the staff were friendly on my flight, and meals were adequate. Needless to say I won't be travelling with Etihad Airways again!

### "it wasn't a very pleasant experience"
This was my first time flying with Etihad Airways and it wasn't a very pleasant experience. The aircraft on the Delhi to Abu Dhabi sector had newer and better business class seats than the Abu Dhabi to LAX sector. Flight was delayed taking off from Delhi and again leaving for Los Angeles from Abu Dhabi. On the second leg of my journey (which was 16.5 hrs), they only had one assigned meal and the rest were optional (which meant, order whenever required). While taking our order, the cabin staff mentioned that they had run out of the chicken option. When I enquired about how that could be possible since I was the in the second cabin (the one after first class), they simply stated that they start taking order from the back of the plane and hence they ran out. I thought this was a one off and didn't really care at the time. Later during the flight, when I tried to order something from their round-the-clock menu, they mentioned that they had run out of everything besides the baklava. It was kind of ridiculous that they expected passengers to eat only one meal during a 16.5 hr flight! On my return journey, I had the same experience. Flight delayed - after getting on the flight, they said they had run out of the mezze platter which is served as a starter. Later again, their round-the-clock menu didnt have enough to keep me (or others for that matter) satisfied. The second leg from Abu Dhabi to Delhi initially had a 2 hour gap but due to the flight getting delayed, this was reduced to about 45 minutes. Had to really hurry in order to catch the flight even without the unhelpful nature of Etihad staff on the plane and their ground staff. No one was ready to guide us through the waiting lines early for us to make it. They simply just shrugged it off. Further, after asking them repeatedly, they didn't hand out landing cards, which are required to be filled out and handed over to immigration at the Delhi. Right before landing, they made an announcement that they didn't have the cards but that their ground staff would have them as soon as we arrive at New Delhi. There was no one from Etihad Airways handing them out and the whole plane had to manage to find the cards and fill them out before finally getting into line at 03.30! Overall, regardless of their lower price than competitors (Emirates etc), I would not recommend flying Etihad again.

### "we were fairly disappointed"
Manchester to Abu Dhabi with Etihad Airways. The check in process went ok, when it came to boarding we were late boarding and late leaving - pilot did say it was to do with traffic at Manchester but if you check this flight daily it does not often leave on time think it is due to the fact the plane has come in that morning about an hour earlier, not enough time to get passengers off and plane cleaned. When it came to the food there was three options for main choice, but by the time the stewardess got to us there was only one choice left. The seat space was tight. On our return journey the initial check in was great - but then it all turned into a mess, as we got called to the gate and had to stand in a long line and queue to have our passports checked, various hand luggage was also been checked here. Why is this not done at security? Once we got our passports checked we were then stood in the gate area which was filling up fast, people all stood in front of the glass doors - when boarding then started they called for passengers in zone 3 and we had to fight our way through the crowds to board the plane. The food came round and once again they had run out of out the chicken course again - I did not like the other options and the stewardess then said there was some crew meals we could have, so she went away and came back with a meal which she described as a low calorie chicken dish - it turned out to be fish! One dish I do not eat good job I did not have an allergy to fish! I appreciate menu did say if your first choice is not available they apologise, but this happened on flight both ways. Me and my partner then tried to use the headsets both of these did not work. Overall we were fairly disappointed with Etihad Airways - they advertise they are a top airline, but not to us!

### "nothing to complain about for service"
I flew Etihad Airways from Edinburgh to Hong Kong via AbuDhabi and there was nothing to complain about for service. The staff were polite and attentive, meals and snacks were lovely, and a good range of films on offer. The downside was the size of seats, which were quite small and legroom could have been bigger but I did get up and walk around a good few times so it was not a major issue.

### "timing and delays is an issue"
Etihad Airways from Munich to Abu Dhabi was delayed one hour and we therefore missed the connection to Bangkok, but got the next flight 2 hours later. We got a voucher to eat and drink. Ground staff helpful and well organized. Seats and food was good, entertainment and service as well. On the way back from Bangkok, our flight was delayed in Bangkok and in Abu Dhabi as well. Timing and delays is an issue with Etihad Airways obviously. On one flight my IG+FE was defect and service couldn´t repair. Luggage arrived ok. Summary: cheap fares but if you have a time issue and have to be somewhere in time, I would recommend other airlines.

### "15 hours sitting in seat without recline"
The flight from Bangalore to Abu Dhabi was smooth and an early landing at Abu Dhabi. Well the trouble started here when the passengers who were to travel to the US were asked to go to US Immigration Services Counter. You pass through a maze of gates and when you reach the desired gate, you see a waiting area of people which should have given me some hint. They had collected our boarding passes and were calling out names as and when our luggage was transferred. Chaos to the core and added to it is the fact that if you don't get a seat to sit, you end upstanding like me and a few others for almost 45 minutes. Finally you get the boarding pass and clear security and rush down to the US immigration counter where again after a long wait you finally get to the gate. Boarded the flight, unfortunately, after the flight took off was when I realised that no amount of pushing gets my seat to recline. After a while, looking around I realized that a lot of seats had to be manually pushed to recline by the stewardess. When I checked with one of them, she said that I can move to any other empty seat in the coach but I couldn't find an empty one that reclined. I was so glad when we landed at O'Hare - after 15 hours of sitting upright in a seat without reclining what can you expect. The IFE was good and food was hot and tasty.

### "such a hype about this airline"
Had a bad experience with Etihad Airways from Chicago to Bangalore via Abu Dhabi. Aircraft is not clean and rather unhygienic. With seating, the leg space was ample, but cramped throughout the journey. Cabin staff were not friendly and helpful. I had to beg for Vegetarian food (even though I had confirmed via booking that I need pure veg). One time I was hungry, and had to take out the meat and eat the rest Veggie. Toilets were unclean and not maintained well. Only good thing was that I had no hassle with luggage. There is such a hype about this airline and its service. Not flying again, and not recommending.

### "no assistance from Etihad Airways staff"
We are Gold/Silver Guest members of Etihad Airways. Recently, we flew on a return trip from Bahrain to Rome (FCO) and on both the long haul flights, between Abu Dhabi and Rome, the flights were delayed by more than one hour. Our luggage was delayed for 3 days when we reached Rome and also on our return journey to Bahrain. Currently awaiting for retrieval of my luggage in Bahrain and with no assistance of any kind from any Etihad Airways staff. Contacted the Etihad Call Center and ther was no response regarding this issue. A friend of ours who flew back to Bahrain with us has also lost (or delayed) his luggage.

### "on this experience I can't recommend this airline"
Madrid to Bangkok via Rome and Abu Dhabi. First two flights operated by Alitalia with no problem . At Madrid check-in I was surprised they didnt give me the boarding pass for the flight from Abu Dhabi to Bangkok. When I arrived in Abu Dhabi I understood. Etihad Airways flight was delayed for 3 hours - and 3 hours which I spent trying to get a boarding pass. Finally, they sent me to the boarding gate, I had to run as it was on the other side of the airport to get a boarding pass. Ground staff were very unhelpful. Flight and cabin crew were pleasant. Furthermore, my bag arrived one day later. Based on this experience, I can't recommend this airline.

### "food was okay but not the best"
Edinburgh to Abu Dhabi on A330, is a relatively new service and a convenient way of bypassing LHR. The chauffeur drive was nice, check in very fast. The lounge was poor and not really worth waiting in but onboard things improved. Very attentive crew, comfortable, older style seats, wine good. My special meal was not on board but they found food for me and gave a letter of apology on landing and air miles as compensation. Food was okay but not the best in the sky.

### "food pretty good and very well presented "
Etihad Airways lounge in Abu Dhabi was superb with a high level of service, food really good, wine great, spa wonderful - they offer a shoe shine service. New flat beds close to the most comfortable I have flown. Crew were superb. Had an over two hour delay at the gate after the doors had closed due to congestion over Muscat but this was handled well and we watched a movie and had a drink. Can choose time of dining. The food was pretty good and very well presented but at times didn't work (herbed potato panacotta didn't work). Comfort of Boeing 787 superb. WiFi was free in Business. One of the best business class flights I have had in terms of service.

### "staff on both legs of my flight were superb"
Dublin to Bangkok via Abu Dhabi with Etihad Airways couldn't have been better. The check-in process in Dublin went smoothly, staff on both legs of my flight were superb, food was good by airplane standards, the inflight entertainment was decent and I had a lot more legroom than I'm used to. The only downfall was that my screen froze, because I was pressing buttons during an announcement. But I rather wanted to sleep, anyway. I fly frequently (usually American Airlines, US Airways, AirAsia, or Ryanair), and Etihad service was better quality overall. I'm not saying the service couldn't have been bad for some, perhaps these are one-offs. People usually only review when they've had either excellent service or poor service - and more often the latter than the former.

### "Ground staff at Abu Dhabi airport not friendly"
London to Manila via Abu Dhabi and my first time to fly with Etihad Airways. It was not good, my flights delayed by 2-3 hrs. Food was so-so. Snack was instant noodles, and since I do not eat instant noodles, I asked for sandwich or biscuits. The flight attendant said they did not have any. He did not offer me anything else. I did not hear any apology. Ground staff at Abu Dhabi airport was not friendly when I asked her about my check-in. If they are not happy with their job, they should leave. Not recommending this airline.

### "arrival in Abu Dhabi chaotic"
The flight from Sydney to AUH was ok, crew pleasant and got extra drinks if requested, but I'm never doing 14 plus hours again. Seats were hard and uncomfortable after a couple of hours. Food ok but small portions and I received my special meal just once out of four meal services - not good enough. Arrival in Abu Dhabi was chaotic - why the need to go through security after getting off the flight and into transit? The queues were appalling. We'd booked Pearl Assist where they met us and fast-tracked us through lines to the lounge and took us back to the gate for the flight to Athens, really worth it. Bussed out to the plane in the searing heat for the flight to Athens, not a full flight so room to spread out. All flights near enough on time and they didn't lose our luggage!

### "flight delayed a bit but was great"
I flew Etihad Airways DMM-AUH-IAD return. DMM-AUH flight delayed by almost 1 hour. Couldn't use lounge, even though I'm a Silver member of Etihad FFP. AUH airport doesn't always use airbridges. and you have to use the bus from plane to terminal. Three security checks for US pre-clearance. Again, couldn't use the lounge after pre-clearance. The only lounge you could use as a silver member is Reem lounge in a different terminal (and that should be done before pre-clearance). Also, the departure area is a bit small, so it can get crowded sometimes. AUH-IAD flight was great. After you land, you just walk out with your luggage. IAD-AUH Silver members were allowed to use IAD lounge, which was amazing. The lounge is newly built and very professional staff. Flight was also great. AUH-DMM was delayed a bit but was great. Overall I would rate my trip as 7/10, but with the lounge access at IAD, I would ramp it to 9/10.

### "very disappointing experience"
First time flying with Etihad Airways (Heathrow to Trivandrum via Abu Dhabi), and a very disappointing experience. Our luggages didn't arrive on the day from Heathrow to Trivandrum and the same thing happened on our return journey from Trivandrum to London. The choices of food served onboard the flights were not enjoyable either. We have always previously flown with Emirates and can now say we certainly prefer it. I can't believe Etihad Airways has won awards! ?

### "business class seat made trip relaxing"
Etihad Airways Business Class from Abu Dhabi to Athens on A330. The food was good, entertainment system was also good. The seat is flat and the blanket and privacy of business class seat made my trip relaxing and smooth. I recommend you to ask the crew for the travel kit, which includes eye shades and socks.

### "utterly disappointed with Etihad Airways"
We flew Etihad Airways from Perth to London via Abu Dhabi in August and back in September, and were utterly disappointed with Etihad Airways. The service was poor and the staff never had a smile on their faces. On the way over we had a choice for dinner - we were a quarter of the way through the aircraft there was no choice and only one option which when served was cold. Every time someone asked for a drink, the bar was closed, and when my husband asked for an apple juice that was forgotten and never arrived. On the way back we were served chicken breast, mashed potatoes and veg at 6.00am in the morning. Totally inappropriate and not enjoyable. This was the first time we had flown Etihad Airways (we normally fly Emirates) and it will certainly be the last time. And we were not the only ones complaining. We were speaking to people at Heathrow who had an even worse opinion about Etihad Airways. The fares were expensive and when we decided to move our flight ahead by about 4 days we were charged an extra $700 - daylight robbery.

### "very friendly specially with kids"
Etihad Airways Flight attendants were very friendly specially with kids. Children received a small bag with activity books, later useful to put documents. Seats were comfortable and the tvs worked well. Clean and large bathroom. Before we arrived they offered ice cream to kids and a greeting card.

### "service onboard was extremely poor"
Etihad Airways present themselves as a leading airline - are they for real?! I took a flight from Rome to Abu Dhabi in economy class, so I didn't expect anything special, but since this company apparently like to celebrate itself, I expected to be a bit better than regular economy - wrong expectation. The seats were narrow, uncomfortable and worn out. Space for legs was non existent. Service onboard was extremely poor, nobody really cares. My monitor didn't work so I asked the flight attendant if it was possible to sit somewhere else, the answer was "we will let you know after take off". Obviously soon after nobody cared any more about my request, and I didn't bother to ask again. I haven't seen a smile from the staff during the flight except for a male flight attendant (the only male), who was trying his best despite the miserable situation in economy. I was very thirsty so  asked for some water and was told to wait for them to pass by with the trolley - a lady asked for the same thing and she received the same answer. We had to wait half an hour. At the end of the flight before leaving the plane they were in line with their plastic smile they need to have by the contract - apparently this only happens at the end of the flight. I really do not understand how this airline can consider itself a "leading airline", the level of professionalism and courtesy onboard is embarassing.

### "cannot believe they have won awards"
Missed our Etihad Airways connection in Abu Dhabi and not placed on next flight. After an argument with customer service we were eventually placed on the sooner flight. Then they lost my bag, and offered 26GBP for my trouble. I cannot believe they have won awards. Food was terrible, the ground staff were rude and lied. I travel quite a bit overseas for business and fly with Emirates, but I thought this time I would try Etihad Airways. Do yourself a favour and avoid this airline at all cost.

### "shortcomings in economy"
We flew Etihad Airways from Manchester to Hong Kong and return. We did economy on the first leg and paid for Business for the second leg from Abu Dhabi (AUH), so we had experience of both levels of service. Etihad Airways was on the whole okay with a lot of shortcomings in economy. They need to improve their customer service which was on occasion lacking. We used a sister airline (Air Seychelles) for business class and their service was very good to excellent.

### "cabin crew were very attentive"
We flew Etihad Airways from Abu Dhabi to Dusseldorf in Business Class. Excellent service provided by the cabin crew, they were very attentive. We found the food to be of an acceptable airline standard, served hot and well presented.

### "situation was handled appallingly"
During a recent flight from Melbourne to Milan, Etihad Airways lost our luggage for 5 days. I would call Airport Handling (Etihad’s lost luggage agent at Malpensa airport) and after holding for about 10 minutes an automated voice would say ‘Our representatives are busy on other calls and cannot help you now. Please call back later’. The call would then terminate. It was incredibly frustrating. The only phone number I could find for Etihad was a ticket reservation number which went through to a call centre in Ireland. The representative there told me that he could not assist. The only means of contact I could find to contact Etihad was the complaints forum on its website. After not hearing anything for two weeks, I emailed again, and it seems that Etihad never received my complaint. Apart from one email from Etihad Airways asking when I sent my original complaint, I never heard back from the airline. I have contacted them four times to the prescribed email address, and never heard back. No assistance, apology or proper communication was given by Etihad Airways. The situation was handled appallingly. It ruined our holiday. On our return flight, we had to wait 2 hours in a plane on a runway from Abu Dhabi because ‘some passenger luggage could not be located’.

### "small but nice aircraft"
Seychelles to Abu Dhabi on Etihad Airways A320, a small but nice aircraft. Seats are non moving, you can't relax by pushing your seat back, its locked. Entertainment system is nice - smooth touch, variety of entertainment. Food have options like 2-3 non vegetarian dishes and one veg dish. But these aircraft were not carrying blankets, when we were feeling cold we asked for blanket, the crew member said they don't have blankets but would ask the pilot to increase temperature. A problem with Etihad airways that is they are late - I had travelled 2-3 times with Etihad Airways, all the time they were late and we have to run for change of plane..

### "unwilling to help and unsympathetic"
I booked with Etihad Airways on recommendation of my travel agent. Had I known better about the experience, I would have I never would have booked with them. I had a decent flight out of Toronto but my way home was a nightmare! On March 30th, I had flown from Melbourne with Tigerair and due to a weather related delay I missed my flight with Etihad. The agents that assisted me at Sydney Airport were wonderful. They were sympathetic and understanding and wanted to try and assist so the best possible outcome could occur. I was re-booked straight through to Toronto on April 1st like I wanted, however the agents told me that my booking was in 2 different travel classes and it needed to be uniform for the ticket to be issued in the system. Upon hearing this I went to the Flight Centre store in the international terminal at Sydney Airport since my booking was held with them, and asked their agent to contact the agent that I had worked with in Toronto to see if the booking class could be switched. They along with my Toronto based agent were unable to do so despite trying their hardest. I ended up at the Etihad Airways office in Sydney and they wanted over $2200 to change my booking, and against my wishes put me on a flight to New York City on April 5th. Agents at this Etihad Airways office were rude, unwilling to help and thoroughly unsympathetic. As a result of all this, I ended up missing an important event. My complaints to staff at Etihad Airways Toronto office went unanswered and no follow-up was done.

### "business class disappointed"
I booked with Etihad Airways on business class and extremely disappointed. Firstly, I was not offered a chauffeur service in Sydney for some reason. Even when I called up Etihad Airways they did not state why I couldn't get a Chauffeur service. I arrived to the airport 3 hours before my flight to avoid any problems. Checking in was painful and stressful, staff rude and unwelcoming. I had 5kg extra and she would not let me go through. The experience became a little bit better after. Got an express passport check ticket. The lounge was pleasant and service was pretty good. The seat onboard was pretty comfortable. The food was great, lighting soothing and the flight attendants helpful and friendly. It says on the website that you get free access to the internet - you have to pay and it didnt work most of my flight! Abu Dhabi airport was a disaster. Having only 1 hour transit there was no point going to the lounge, so I head straight into my gate. The airport was boiling, crowded and lots of random passport checking before gates. Only 1 person checking the passport for 5 gates. Extremely time consuming and draining after a 14 hours flight. Flight to Kuwait was generic. I am flying Emirates or Qatar Airways next time.

### Etihad Airways customer review
We were booked business class (admittedly a discount fare, but still extra thousands spent) from London to Perth Australia. We even spent our money on a Heathrow Hilton same terminal stay to make it even easier. A few hours before the departure we received a abrupt email saying our flight was canceled, that is when the bad treatment started. My strong and supportive wife was reduced tears by the treatment we received from the rude staff. If you fly with Etihad Airways you will remember this posting and wish you had taken it a bit more seriously. Worst company I have had the misfortune of had any business with. Once you pay, you are a number and nothing more.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Amsterdam to Abu Dhabi took off around 10 PM, our seats could not be reclined, they seemed to be broke. There were no spare seats available. Leg space was insufficient for me. Seats were uncomfortable and rock-hard. Had to spend the whole night in a upright position. Our corresponding flight, scheduled for 10 AM, with even more cramped seats, was delayed for almost 10 hours and finally left at 7:30 PM. No way for a refund, due to technical problems etc.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Regular business class flyer and chose Etihad for the first time due to its convenient schedules into and out of Brisbane. A380 and 777. Have read the criticism of the lie flat seats but I found them fine and quite comfortable. A little bit firmer than other airines and I think no Pyjamas. Food was quite good too. Lounge en-route very good, but busy. Lounge in Heathrow has good service and food as well, the staff there should be commended. Service enroute was efficient. So overall quite good as the schedules are convenient, lounges and food are good, I think the seats/beds are okay too. The bad part of the experience. Ticketing. Booked through a travel agent but had to confirm a change with ticketing in Heathrow as it was after hours for my agent at home. The ticketing agent Heathrow, could not have been less helpful from the start. Firstly ranting about how it is against IATA regulations for her to do anything, how the change would cost 3000 pounds, etc. Luckily my agent made the change in minutes for 100 pounds. Inflight entertainment. Definitely bring your own if you are from a western country. Almost no recent movies or TV shows. Long flights are the only time I get to watch movies in peace, so that was very disappointing. Quite a long line for check-in at heathrow. Business class waited close to 30 minutes for check-in which is unusual. I do understand it is an A380 but there were lots of empty check in counters further along. So overall the inflight entertainment and just a very unpleasant experience with my only contact point being Heathrow ticketing I will probably avoid flying them again. But for the aircraft/lounges/service etc that was no problems at all.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Cabin Crew brilliant - food good - service excellent (although at one point on the return journey people were helping themselves in the kitchen area). Seating atrocious, ok we were economy and in the row of 4 in the middle of the plane - sardines spring to mind but on a very tight package. Had I not moved my arm from the armrest the trolley would have taken it off thats how tight they are. We visited a flight centre in Adelaide to tranfer seats to the exit doors (which we had to pay exra for). Much better - but - a passenger was ill and vomiting in the toilet, when he was not vomiting he was sat directly in front of us on the air stewards seat, the toilet was not sealed off to other passengers - this passenger alternated between the toilet and the seat for at least 2 hours (the smell was not nice). There were empty seats but another class. On such a long haul flight no one should be so crammed in and so uncomfortable that the experience becomes unpleasant. We did ask to upgrade but the cost was 8,000Euros which to say the least is extortionate bearing in mind what we had already paid and the extra to move seats. So those seats flew empty.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Flight from SIN to AUH was in a new B787-9. Seat was much better than on Etihad's A330 aircrafts although legroom is quite limited (I am 1.88m tall). IFE had a large screen and was very nice, choice of movies is good but not as good as on other airlines. The IFE is deactivated nearly an hour before landing - could not understand why so early. Food was decent, drinks ok. Flight from AUH to VIE was with Flyniki on an A320. No IFE, but seat comfort was actually better than on the B787-9. Food was average, lots of plastic on the tablet. Staff very friendly. However, the worst is that there are only two toilets for ca. 140 persons in Economy class - it takes ages until you make your way there - plan in advance!. Cleanliness of toilets is as you can expect.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Having booked Business class we expected a higher class of service. As we knew there was a 2 hour turn around at Abu Dhabi we were pleased to see that both our suitcases were labelled 'Hot transfer' and Priority. However this was to prove pointless as on awaiting take off from Abu Dhabi we were delayed due to awaiting transfer baggage. On arriving at Male however neither of our cases arrived. We went to the baggage reclaim section in Male where the Etihad staff member was totally disinterested in our problem. She was ineffective, offered no apology or useful information. Having travelled business we expected a far better service - we appreciate that there are high volumes of luggage but at least an apology and regular updates are not too much to ask for. Also once on the plane (A320) my husbands head rest was broken and he has to stand for around half an hour whilst an engineer was called to fix, once on the second part of the flight his foot rest was broken. This was still broken on the return flight. Several requests for food and drink had to be repeated as the drinks/food did not arrive. I cannot eat sea food or poultry and on the return journey both starters contained sea food - so I could not eat either - surely one option should be vegetarian. Overall our experience of Etihad is very poor and on returning to the UK the ease of trying to contact the relevant departments is also very complicated. It appears that Etihad do not have any true form of customer service.

The crew were cooperative and helpful. Food wasn't good. Bathrooms were clean. Flights were on time. Service was great.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Good experience. On time take off. Excellent service by FAs. Comfortable seats, roomy 180 degree recline. Good food. Marginal IFE with limited selection. Otherwise will look forward to flying with them again

### Etihad Airways customer review
Connecting flight from Bahrain to Abu Dhabi was awful. Besides being late the PA gong was broken and chimed continously throughout the entire flight. The PA announcements were continous throughout the hour long flight and the information largely superflous. Main flight from Abu Dhabi: rudest inflight service I have experienced. Asked for a whisky and ice which was grudgingly served up with a max of 10 ml of scotch. Baggage was lost, I had to wait for the entire off load (nearly 1 hour) before reporting it. Normally passengers are tannoyed well before that point. Will not be re using this service for my 1-2 monthly return flights from Scotland to the Gulf. Will return to using Emirates.

### Etihad Airways customer review
My main issue is their service with luggage. We had a three hour layover in Abu Dhabi. They still managed to lose four bags on the way to Shanghai. They promised to deliver them the next day. Three appeared four days later, while we are still awaiting the last bag a week later. They don't respond to inquiries. The flight experience was average. Attendants were gone for long stretches but friendly when you got them. The screen for economy is good if you watch movies. Flights on-time. Seat rather uncomfortable. But when they lose my luggage even though they had plenty of time to transfer the bags and don't respond to inquiries, they lose my service.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Very poor value for money considering the price for Business Class flight. Although the cabin crew were helpful, the food was absolutely awful. Topped with a one hour delay in leaving London, I literally had to sprint between terminals to catch connecting flight in Abu Dhabi. The ground staff in Abu Dhabi were the most unhelpful bunch that I've ever had the misfortune to deal with. Rude, arrogant and generally have no conception of customer service. It was if the passengers were a general inconvenience to them. Shocking service overall and would advise paying a little extra with another airline. The only good thing I could say about them was that the check in staff at Heathrow were great. Fast, friendly and very helpful.

### Etihad Airways customer review
I spent a long time sourcing a seat on the A380 for Abu Dhabi to London leg and the same on the return. These were both confirmed A380 at the time of booking. Turned up at check in to be told the aircraft had changed to an A340 and different seats had been allocated on both legs - terrific! I paid for one thing and got another. No advanced word, no apologies, nothing. So that set a downer for the whole trip, as I was looking forward to the enhanced First Class amenities that the A380 offers (and what I had initially paid for). Cabin staff, food, seating, IFE, lounges all good. As a paying customer I expect to get what I booked. If that's not available I expect to get word of any changes in order to make an informed decision of what I want to do next. Etihad Airways are miles behind Emirates. Won't be going with Etihad Airways again.

### Etihad Airways customer review
My experience with Etihad Airways was bad. My flight from Kuwait was delayed by 1 hour and on reaching Abu Dhabi, the ground staff told us that due to delay in flight, the next flight will be after 12 hrs. According to the display on the screen, the flight which we were to board was still there. After that, we were not given any lounge to stay in. The ground staff was avoiding to talk to us. we were a group of 15 people for the same route. We tried to talk to them a number of times, but getting no proper answer at all. On return flight, on reaching Kuwait I was told that your luggage has not arrived. I was told to wait for the next flight, and I got message of receipt of luggage at the airport after 10 hrs.

### Etihad Airways customer review
My experience was very negative about Etihad Airways, this airline has some serious issues with its ground staff. Upon check in at Dulles Airport, I was informed by that Hand Luggage should be not more than 7 Kg. so the first thing we did was to check our Hand luggage which was in the range of 7.25-7.50 Kgs, but the staff of Etihad insisted that it should be 7.0 Kg, not 7.5 even, so we started adjusting the weight in-between the carry-ons like a puzzle game till we manage to have 7.0 Kg exactly by their scale. Another problem was not far away when staff asked me about the (Exit-Rentry Permit) for my wife which is a requirement to travel to Saudi Arabia. I informed her its an Online procedure and they don't issue hard copies, but she kept on insisting that a Hard copy is required otherwise we all be offloaded. I tried my best to explain that it should show on your system, but she never listened to me. As a last resort, I went to the Supervisor who asked me if I have the Residence Permit number, which I had and everything was fine. Now why didn't the lady at the counter ask me this before off-loading me? So we got in the line again for Check-in and went through the tedious process again and I couldn't believe it when they handed me over the Boarding passes. On the departure gate, all our Hand-carry luggage was weighed again, anybody who bought anything from the Duty-Free shop was in trouble. Etihad Airways may have a good in-flight service , but very lousy ground handling staff. That the Last time I am traveling on Etihad Airways.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Flight was comfortable, crew were helpful. Food was very tasty. But the flight was two hours delay in take off. Because of this delay I had only 15 mins to catch my next connecting flight to Chennai. The flight was supposed to take off by 9:30 am but it took off by 11:30am. It's supposed to land at Abu Dhabi by 7:40pm but landed at 9:05pm and my next connecting flight was by 9:30pm. After that I managed to reach Chennai. But I was shocked to know that they did not transit my 4 bags that were left in Abu Dhabi. Then they told me to lodge the complaint on missing baggage. After lengthy procedure they agreed to send my baggage in next flight. All my friends say Etihad Airways is always delayed.

### Etihad Airways customer review
JFK-IKA via Abu Dhabi. On the first flight, seats were very comfortable with usb ports to charge your phone, and the size of the PTV was quite large for economy class. The first meal was delicious, the second meal not so much, but there was a constant flow of snacks during the flight. The staff were kind and helpful. On our second flight which was only 1.5 hours they gave us a meal, and two drink services. I was very pleased with my experience on Etihad.

### Etihad Airways customer review
I booked the chauffeur online over 36 hours before departure, got an acknowledgement that I would be contacted 24 hours before departure, but never heard any more. So I made my own way to the airport as wasn't sure if they would come. Lounge in Heathrow was stuffy, although good service. A380 flight was very pleasant and food OK. Flight attendants friendly enough. A330 to Perth felt claustrophobic and I think is too small a plane for such a long flight. My baggage did not arrive, (was not a tight connection). Many of the other business class passengers bags did not arrive either. My bag arrived 48 hours later, still with priority tag in place. It obviously served no purpose! I felt the service I received as a business class passenger was unsatisfactory and have lost confidence in Etihad.

### Etihad Airways customer review
I have just taken a very long haul flight half way across the world with Etihad in economy, and I am shocked at the service I received. Etihad seriously lacks in a lot of areas. I expected so much more from such a high profile airline. Check-in was the best part as a member of staff noticed I am very tall and sourced an exit row seat for me which I was extremely thankful for as it was a 13hr flight, but the tired Boeing 777 had uncomfortable aged seats and I couldn't wait to land. I selected a non-lactose meal, and it seemed to be half the amount of the regular meal, why is this? I had no bread roll or desert (both didn't contain dairy). On a 13hr flight we were only given two small meals and a snack which was a muffin. I didn't see any attendants for hours in between meals. I only noticed one lot of drinks being bought round, and other customers had to constantly call for drinks and food, and when asked it seemed such a big effort for them. The attendant who served me hardly spoke English, and didn't have a clue what was going on. I asked for a coffee and the cup wasn't even half full. I asked her why, and she said she ran out of coffee! Abu Dhabi airport shops were all high end expensive boutiques, not much opportunities for normal people. Most travelers were swarming the food court and alcohol and tobacco shops, no one was in the expensive ones. Toilets were disgusting! I asked at a transfer desk if there was any way I could get an exit row seat, I was just told "no, the flight is full". Unexceptable in my opinion. It is so uncomfortable and stressful having to sit in a regular seat when you are very tall, it makes the journey a nightmare. The A380 was a nicer plane, but everything else was still terrible - like the first leg. Attendants were rude and unhelpful, they had no sympathy for me being squashed in a normal seat. This was only a 7hr flight but we received more drinks than the 13hr flight? On both flights VOD was awful. I had flown with Etihad a few years ago and it was just the same, but I thought I would try again and see if they had improved due to the new fleet of aircraft, but how wrong I was. Next time I shall fly with Qatar Airways or Singapore Airways.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Clean cabin, attendants kind. Seats were nice, entertainment was fairly good and food delicious. Landed at 7am and generally found it a pleasant flight. However when I departed from the UK with Boeing 777-300ER Manchester to Abu Dhabi I found seat pitch pretty tight and slightly uncomfortable. Next time will probably try Qatar Airways or Emirates.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Automatically upgraded to business class, had a great experience on the overnight flight from Abu Dhabi to Rome. Excellent seats and service. Flight delayed by an hour due to slow boarding, fortunately the pilot managed to make up time in the air.

### Etihad Airways customer review
I recently flew to Dublin from Sydney in Business Class. While Sydney to Abu Dhabi was good, Abu Dhabi to Dublin was a nightmare. In from of my seat was a mother with two small children who screamed or cried almost all of the 7.5 hours or leaned over the back of the seat to knock things off my table or shout. I returned from Rome where I expected an Etihad Airways flight and decided it would be better in economy because at least screaming children are expected there. We boarded what we thought was an Etihad Airways flight, but found it to be Alitalia. The food was inedible, the seats were cramped and really uncomfortable and the crew unhelpful. I did not request Alitalia and after that I never will again fly Etihad Airways if they are partnering with them. In Abu Dhabi we again boarded what was supposed to be Etihad Airways, but this time it was Virgin Australia. They were fine. In Abu Dhabi I tried on three occasions to use my frequent flyer points to upgrade to Business class with frustrating results which ultimately failed and we boarded a fully booked flight to Sydney.

### Etihad Airways customer review
I was upgraded on my flight from Sydney to business class. The plane was brand new, seating great with ample storage and space. I could watch a show/movie on the tv screen and also have the flight path displayed on the controller. The meal and drinks was impressive and offered in the onboard lounge as well. The staff were friendly and attentive. The downside is that internet onboard is paid for and it's quite pricey for what you get overall.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Upgraded to Business using miles as flying economy out of ISB is such a miserable experience in economy. Had been sat in my nice business class seat for less than 2 minutes when the stewardess tipped a full tray of juice all over me! I was soaked! Admittedly it was a stupid passenger that had knocked into her and precipitated the event. However, soaked in sticky juice with another 12 hours of travelling ahead of me was awful. The stewardess was very apologetic and the CSD came to see me and promised all manner of wonderful things when I got to AUH such as the option to shower and fresh clothing being available. Sadly when I got to AUH nothing materialised. I then made my way on my next flight to London having dried out naturally. When I got back to the UK I contacted Etihad's customer service and whilst acknowledging what a poor experience I had endured and whilst espousing how customer service is Etihad's priority, denied my request and offered a partial refund of 10,000 miles - that was the sum total of Etihad's service recovery. Needless to say I have not flown with them since.

### Etihad Airways customer review
The flight was listed as 2200hrs departure but when I got to the waiting area at 2100hrs as per the boarding time on my boarding pass and sitting there for close to 30mins before hearing mumblings of some passengers that the flight is delayed for 30 minutes! Eventually boarding started at 2145hrs. Once most passengers were seated, we heard from the flight deck that there is going to be another 45 minutes delay. The plane is new, barely over one month old. The connector for their (I feel misrepresented) noise-cancelling earphones is rather fancy, almost taking a leaf from Apple's Magsafe2 technology of magnetic connection, not the usual 2 prong. The selection of viewing material quite impressive (not as much as Emirates). One thing which I had great difficulty getting use to most of the flight was the fragrance that they incorporated into the air-conditioning. The staff in Economy cabin were mostly smiling and friendly. They came down the aisle with trays of water during the flight. Food  was a slight let down. I chose the vegetarian option for the late supper, but wasn't that satisfactory. The light "snack" they gave before landing was just a bun with I think red bean paste in it?

### Etihad Airways customer review
Absolutely awful. Do not fall for the fancy advertisments as they mislead you. Delays were up to 2 hours and rude ground and cabin crew. Food was simply standard. Breakfast was bland and soggy. The IFE was very good. The crew service was rushed and the atmosphere was awful. Never again!

### Etihad Airways customer review
Flew business class from London to Mumbai to Manila all via Abu Dhabi. Every leg had a problem from delayed flights of up to 1.5 hours to lost luggage and rude staff. It's the first time I've used Etihad and from all the media adverts was hoping to have an amazing experience however this was the total opposite. Will not recommend Etihad nor fly even if they are the cheapest.

EY12, 27/5/15. EY460, 28/5/15. EY461, 14/6/15. I've flown from London to Sydney twice in the past 18 months, and London to Melbourne once - all via Etihad - and have nothing but praise for the service, comfort and attention I received. Superior to my previous experiences of this route with Virgin Atlantic (and cheaper).

### Etihad Airways customer review
MEL-AUH on time, crew attentive. IFE very good had a wide range of channels. Food delicious, seats comfortable but felt crammed in. AUH-ATH was a shocker. Abu Dhabi ground staff are rude and airport is poorly run. The flight wasn't much better with rude staff. My headphones didn't work and the FA wouldn't give me a new pair. Food was mediocre and legroom was a better. Flight was filled was children that were running wildly through the cabin. Before landing, passengers were self serving themselves alcohol in the galley. Business Class was complaining but FAs didn't care.

### Etihad Airways customer review
VIE to Bkk via Abu Dhabi. Booked flight directly on Etihad homepage. Flight from VIE to AHD was with Niki. Aircraft did not have IFE, everything was very tight an uncomfortable. Meal was small, served cold. The Austrian wine was excellent! Staff very friendly. Onward flight was with an Etihad A330. Seat in Economy class was even worse as on Niki"s A320/321. IFE had a very limitted choice on movies, food was average, served in plastic dishes. Wine quality was quite poor. Actually had expected service and comfort comparable to Qatar Airways or Emirates - but is far from it. Hope that return flight from Singapore is better! Most likely will choose Emirates or Qatar again on my next flight to Asia.

### Etihad Airways customer review
My first trip on Etihad was disappointing, BKK-AUH-FCO-AUH-BKK with the web purchased business upgrade for the BKK-AUH sector didn't turn out to be much of an Etihad experience. The sector BKK-AUH was on a Jet Airways and the sector from AUH to FCO with Alitalia. Zero Etihad experience. BKK-AUH was ok as I slept the trip in Biz class though the configuration of the Jet Airways business class is a bit odd. Everyone is pointing sideways. AUH-FCO operated by Alitalia wasn’t as pleasant. Staff seemed clearly unhappy and stressed out. At the end of a cartoonish safety video that ends with the phrase “your crew is perfectly trained” the Captain announced in English “Cabin staff get ready for landing” as we were still waiting at the foot of the runway for take-off. I had to contact by phone Etihad’s 24 hour help center, besides not being particularly friendly or polite, they didn’t understand the problem I had and finally left me hanging on the phone until the system cut me off. This happened twice. Because the issue surrounded a 6 + 11 hour delay and because the flight originated from Europe where consumer rights state that any flight with a delay greater than 5 hours may be refunded I was able to change carriers and fly back with a different company. Etihad thanks but no thanks, never again.

Flight attendants and food great. Flat beds were comfortable, the lounge at Abu Dhabi also has a smoking room  which is well ventilated and comfortable. Would use again but not from Edinburgh, the airport customer service there lets it down.

### Etihad Airways customer review
I travelled from Toronto to Colombo and back. My requested meal was low sodium. Sodium level was OK, however what was offered was completely inadequate (I am not a voracious feeder) and I was starving. I had several meals on both forward and return journey. They were almost the same kind of meals on all flights. On most occassions it was one standard dish with some potatoes or rice with chicken and green peas and a small fruit container. The tray had only these two containers and nothing else. There was absolutely nothing of salad, bun, biscuit or cheese etc.

### Etihad Airways customer review
As a loyal customer to Etihad Airways since the beginning, the service has got worse and prices gone up. Limo was late, blamed me as I was not waiting for him on the street. Lounge full of travel agents on a free trip that were getting VIP treatment. All paying customers being ignored had to ask 3 times for a glass of water. Crew were average and forgetful on both flights. Lounge at Abu Dhabi was crowded, and have to wait to use a toilet at least 10 minutes. Staff are useless if you have a question. 5. Abu Dhabi airport overcrowded and lots of building work seems to take at least 30 minute upon landing/departure to from the gate.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Found the seats  quite uncomfortable, I'm only 5ft 2 and felt squashed. During our second leg from Abu Dhabi to Bangkok my sister and I couldn't sleep for back pain and over a long distance the seats aren't very suitable. The food was ok, but after the meal I found myself still hungry, and the 'snacks' (dry crackers) weren't nice. They also kept running out of meals which shouldn't be happening. The staff were pleasant. On both journeys the plane was delayed with little if any information given to customers, we missed our connecting flight from AUH to BKK and had to be booked on a later flight, causing us to miss our transfer which was prepaid. The staff were very unapologetic, however it was organised well. Overall the main complaint was the lack of comfort, it felt as though we were all packed in like sardines.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Arrived early to check in, get good seats and relax in the lounge. Told the flight was overbooked and to wait. After an hour we asked what was going on and told sorry sir, we'll get a supervisor. Offered 300 USD to fly 12 hours later (no thanks) we paid 8000AUD for these flights. Staff were nonchalant and pretty uncaring. We finally got seats, but not together. Never again - best airline, yeah right!

### Etihad Airways customer review
First flight from Munich to Abu Dhabi was delayed so I missed my connection to Bangkok and had to wait for 5 hours. I really wonder who is managing the construction and operation of the airport in Abu Dhabi. It takes at least 20 minutes to get to the gates after landing. My next destination was Manila with a 1 hour layover before heading to Hong Kong The flight was late again and once arrived in Manila I found out that in order to catch the next flight I had to go though immigration, go to another terminal (40 min taxi ride) and check in again. The ground staff in Manila told me that this happens all the time and that Etihad does not care about their passengers and their only goal is to send them away from their hub in Abu Dhabi. So I got on a plane 3 hours later and arrived in HK with a 15 hour delay and without my luggage. The company could not locate my luggage. Fortunately, I received it one day later. Etihad Airways customer service is far below average. They did not respond to my email for 10 days now and hang up on the phone twice. Their website is not working at all on a constant basis.

### Etihad Airways customer review
It's not the experience I heard about it. We got delayed an hour because the engine on the airplane won't start, according to the pilot the engine was to hot and they had to turn off the entire airplane electricity, which left us without AC on the plane and the summer heat of Kuwait. They could at least let us go back to the boarding gate, until the engine gets fixed. Luckily the engine started and we were on our way to Abu Dhabi. We were served a chicken sandwich and water. That's it. No, salad, fruit or dessert. Nothing, but a mayo-filled chicken sandwich and water. Very disappointed with this airline, first and last time flying Etihad

### Etihad Airways customer review

### Etihad Airways customer review
Flight from Thiruvanthrapura (EY273) was delayed by 4 plus hours which meant we missed on ward flight to London from Abu Dhabi. The crew on EY273 were surly and service was poor, the breakfast served was inedible. The crew seeem to disappear after breakfast was served, so drinks were not forthcoming. When we transferred planes I was given a middle row seat despite explaining to ground staff at Thirvanthrapura the difficulties I had because of my height. Fortunately the chief steward on the connecting flight saw sense and moved me, but I was now seperated from my wife. I have wrote to Etihad complaining, but they have not even had the courtesy to acknowledge my letter after 1 month.

### Etihad Airways customer review
We booked our flights and picked specific seats 10 months before we flew and never ended up with any of the seats we had selected. On one flight, my partner and I weren't even seated together. Most of the flights were delayed 30-60 minutes. The seats were terribly uncomfortable and hard. To top it off, when we checked in at 7am (3 hours early too) for our flight from Abu Dhabi to Sydney, we were told we had no seats, the flight was extremely overbooked, and 12 others were waiting to get on too! After hassling 3 different staff, they finally got my partner and I seats across the aisle from each other. Thankfully a passenger moved so we could sit together. Found out later two other people were bumped off the flight because of our other connecting flights back to NZ.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Flight EY6298 - flight operated by South African Airways SA278 on 24 June 2015. Excellent service by South African Airways! Good tasty food, good wines, friendly staff (Etihad can learn from them). Flight EY57 - 25 June 2015 operated by Etihad. Good service, friendly staff (still South African Airways offers slightly better service and has more leg space). Several hours delay in Abu Dhabi as this airport can clearly not handle high volume of air traffic and passengers. The airport cannot handle the flux of passengers. There is by far not enough seating at the airport, the airport is simply outdated. Flight EY58 - 18 July 2015. A horrible experience. The aircraft seemed to be a loan from Alitalia. One staff member in economy class was simply rude. The seat was sticky with dried food remains, so did the later discovery that the pocket in the seat in front of me was sticky as well. It came clear why when unfolding the table which had food left over and dried sticky juice all over. A crew member helped cleaning the table, yet leaving me with sticky pants and sticky floor carpet under the seat in front of me. Flight EY 6299 - operated by South African Airways, flight SA 279. Service on board, excellent once again by South African Airways. Very friendly and considered staff! On arrival in Johannesburg, about 150 passengers found out that the luggage never arrived in Johannesburg. The queue for baggage claim was very long, yet well handled by South African Airways staff. The entire debacle cost us 2.5 hours! We were told an aircraft would arrive at 16h00 local time with some luggage. At 18h00 hours nothing heard of course. If luggage would not be there with this mentioned flight, it would be the following day. No need to say I have lost all confidence with Etihad.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Flew CPT-JNB-AUH-LCA and return ATH-AUH-JNB. Sadly, this review is yet another negative one for Etihad airways. As a flight enthusiast I was hoping I'd be able to write a positive review, but my experience proved otherwise. Flight from CPT-JNB operated by SAA. I was warned on booking that my flight from JNB that it would be operated on a Jet Airways configured aircraft. I had the emergency exit and found the seats extremely hard and the planes decor dated. The service was superb on this leg. Hereafter it was my only flight on an Etihad airplane (A320), nothing special. Return from ATH-AUH was on an air Seychelles plane (which was not indicated on booking). The A330 was old and tired. The legroom and seat width were generous, however the IFE was beyond terrible and didn't even have E-Box, not to mention the seat map on the online check in was completely different to the real deal. Final flight was operated by SAA. This was my only option when booking for this date, so I had no choice but to accept the codeshare. Unfortunately the codesharing is limited so on check in you cannot select your seat, as a result I ended up in the last row of the plane (which I avoid like the plague) and thus was doomed with limited recline. I do not think I will be travelling Etihad again, mostly because of all of the "partnerships" and codesharing which results in non-Etihad standard service. There is really no comparison to Emirates and Qatar.

### Etihad Airways customer review
My trip from London via Abu Dhabi to Cochin with Etihad was very good regarding food, friendly service of staff and seat comfort, except my connection in Abu Dhabi almost failed. I was escorted to the departure gate in Abu Dhabi, which worked out fine and I caught my connecting flight to Cochin despite the 40mins of delay of my flight from London. My luggage did not arrive, which was not a surprise, with only 30mins layover. But it also did not arrive the next day and the day after, and so on. It arrived 4 days later when I had already left Cochin and I finally received it 1 day after my arrival back in London. The really annoying part however was that whenever I called the Etihad baggage helpline, I received mismatching information about the location of my suitcase. Overall the organisation of Etihad’s baggage lost and found left room for a lot of improvement. I would not dissuade flying with Etihad, but be prepared for unpleasant surprises especially on flights via Abu Dhabi to India. My advice is also to leave at least 2 hours layover for a connecting flight via Abu Dhabi.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Etihad has come a long way since my last experience with them back in 2013. My recent flight from Sydney to Abu Dhabi was on the new A380 aircraft. It's fantastic and includes all the modern features you'd expect incl. in-flight wifi and IFE with touch screen. The service in Business Class was definitely worth every penny, from the friendly service of the multicultural cabin crew to the well prepared menu to the spacious massage seat. The bar area located between the first and business class lounge was a neat touch and I was able to indulge in a few liquors and wines only exclusive to First Class. After the flight, one of the flight attendants was kind enough to give me a quick tour of the first class area incl. the Residence.

### Etihad Airways customer review
How very disappointing! The 10 abreast seating (17 inch) in the 777 is decidedly uncomfortable to the 9 abreast on Qatar or carriers using the A380. Our flight from Abu Dhabi to Melbourne was delayed by an hour due to late arrival of the flight from London (for which they also delayed flights to Sydney, Brisbane and Perth). But we had been loaded on the plane early - and it was hot given the plane had sat in the desert for the day. Then it took them forever to serve the meals, too bad for those of us wanting to get to sleep. Oh - the wine - where do they find this stuff? Have I ever not finished a glass of red before now? Dessert was a shocker too. All very sad - they had excelled 3 years ago when they flew the A340's.

Connecting flight to Melbourne was initially delayed by 5 hours and then a group of us were bumped from the flight to accommodate for other delayed flights and people who had missed their Sydney flight. Terribly handled by the crew, no communication or information given. Very minor compensation given, with minimal information. This is on the back of them losing my bag for three days last year and not taking responsibility, since the last connection was with their partner airline, air Berlin.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Plane was delayed for an hour and I was informed in the morning. No instructions given other than the fact that it was delayed. After clarifying my flight departure by calling into Etihad's London office, I arrived at the airport 2 hours before my flight. Was told on the spot that the gate had been closed and was blamed by the ground crew for being irresponsible by turning up "late" for my flight. It was a really bad experience. Was made to wait 6 hours for my next flight and thankfully, the flight was smooth and inflight crew were courteous. Ground Crew at London Heathrow however were unprofessional.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Never again. Cancelled flight and no concern from ground staff (no representative at the desk in Bahrain) - this meant we missed our connection. Fighting (with 2 kids in the middle of the night) and being sent between transfers and departures non stop in Abu Dhabi. Exhausted, begging for a flight on other airline but no one interested. Finally 11 hours later, delayed flight again, we left for Manchester. Reserved kids meal never came because original flight was cancelled. Crew ignore us, sky nanny decided to help by covering my sons face in black and red face paint which he had a reaction to - took 35 mins to remove. Then to top it off, no luggage when we landed and now 4 days in UK with no bags. Complaint form online says 'link does not work'. No one answers helpline. Worse is I have to travel back with them in a month. Had 2 calls from them to say they have no news! Dreading it. Can't think of one good point about Etihad Airways except there was no queue at check in. Now I know why.

Etihad is a cheaper airline but these people will not be given frequent flyer credit to passengers. My American Airline FF number was printed on boarding pass for each segment but I have yet to receive miles. I have been in touch with American Airlines as well as Etihad on several occasions but to no avail (sent them copies of boarding passes).

### Etihad Airways customer review
Travelled via Sydney on 17th June on 14.15 flight due to last minute alteration. Service from Sydney to Abu Dhabi was poor, didn't receive a drink or food until 2.5 hours into the flight. Ignored by cabin crew on requesting refreshments in the rear galley, generally unfriendly service, also commented on by customers behind us on arrival in Abu Dhabi. Food poor. I have flown Australia to the UK with most of the major airlines and would not fly Eithad again, although the service improved between Abu Dhabi and London.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Abu Dhabi to Johannesburg, plane an outdated Jet Airways run by Etihad. No Internet, but there was a internet Voucher for 20% discount. Seat 37A was broken, did not want to stay upright. Was given a menu, only to be told we don't have chicken any more. Why give a menu if you can not offer what's on there. Food was one of the worst that I have seen onboard a plane. As Etihad Silver guest I was disappointed with the lounge in Abu Dhabi airport also, children running all over the place. Abu Dhabi airport is now getting to much. They offer triple miles on the website when you book, but still did not get the miles, Again why offer something if you don't give it to the passengers. I sent a mail to the Etihad guest program, but till date no reply from them. Don't recommend anyone to take the Johannesburg to Abu Dhabi route and back till they upgrade the flights to aircraft that is not owned by Jet Airways.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Poor service by crew inflight. Looks they are ignoring some customers or not well trained compared to other airlines. Seats were comfortable but bedroll was not available on each seat - you have to ask for it. Food quality was poor when I have already pre registered for food choice. There was no choice available as per normal business class, and it was pre decided same as economy class. The business class Lounge at Brussels airport had little seating space available and not comfortable at all.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Price was good, competition between Middle Eastern airlines has now knocked BA off the radar as far as the Perth - UK regional airports is concerned on both price and flying time. 2 flights rather than 3 flights is far better. Being able to fly directly into regional airports missing out Heathrow is a big plus. Seat comfort not great, then no economy seat is comfortable for 11 hours! I did find the seats very hard and I needed to sit on a pillow. The flight was extremely full - every seat taken, good for the airline but not good for passengers! Food a mixed bag, good dinner on way back but no breakfast served before arrival in Perth instead a chicken dinner meal? Would have preferred a cold breakfast - fruit or just a bread roll option. A potato sandwich was served as a snack before landing in Manchester. The pasta dish was good and the noodle dish was excellent. Ground staff did take a bottle of suntan lotion bought in duty free at Manchester fully sealed in a tamper proof bag with receipt showing, despite being assured by the shop assistant in Manchester that it would not be a problem transiting with it so long as it was in the tamper proof bag. Etihad please communicate with other airports re this if this is your policy! Another point on transiting, I fully understand the need for enhanced security at the gate however once you are in the gate you cannot go out and there is no water available or toilet facilities in the gate. Also better crowd control was needed at Manchester as when announced that rows 1 to 3 could board - literally more than half the passengers stood up and started to queue, despite being told several times not to!

### Etihad Airways customer review
Although the lounge that Etihad uses in Manila is somewhat basic, the service on board the flight more than compensates. The aircraft flown was a 2 class 777 and my only complaint is that the seat is rather narrow for a substantial Westerner. The seat was however lie flat and was quite comfortable although storage space for small items is lacking. The service onboard was excellent. The cabin crew were attentive and helpful. The choices available for both food and drink were plentiful and catered to all tastes. The IFE system offered enough choice in film and music although other airlines certainly offer more. I would certainly fly with Etihad again.

### Etihad Airways customer review
I booked Etihad for a return flight from Ireland to Phuket for our family. The leg room seemed less than other airlines I`ve travelled with for similar long distance flights. The food was poor. On our flight out of the options, one of the 3 was unavailable and they had only just started service. On the way back the dinner options were a chicken dish, a plain pasta option and fish option. After a third of passengers had been served the only option left was fish. We expected more than this and the 3 half glasses of wine we were given on each flight. On the upside the entertainment system was very good, the flights were on time and the transfers went without a hitch.

### Etihad Airways customer review
AUH-MNL, exemplary except the food, which is always a bit disappointing. Lovely flat bed seats, attentive and friendly service, great drinks selection and good IFE. Hard to fault, though they let themselves down on the food.

Flew EY653 AUH-CAI and return EY654 CAI-AUH. Check in at Etihad Air Mall in DXB was smooth and took the coach to AUH. First flight was smooth drinks were passing around all the time, though it is Ramadan. Meal was not good at all,  it was a morning flight they served lunch. With small portions and not up to standards of other competition on the same sector. Crew were friendly though seemed new or a bit lost. Seats are comfortable on the A340. Headsets are top notch but not their entertainment system - not user friendly one and less options. And it doesn't work until half way of the flight and crew collect head sets almost an hour before landing. On the return flight it was almost empty. With a very cold cabin surprisingly there were no blankets on the flight to be offered . No drink rounds. Meal was just a Ramadan Iftar box with some bland sandwiches for a 4 hrs flight. No tea or coffee offered and crew just disappeared. They were very keen on selling their duty free products only. My entertainment system had a problem with the audio and informed the crew - she just apologised with no offer to transfer to another seat with the flight almost empty and many rows were totally deserted and I had to use the entertainment system on the seat next to me which was free as well. Still the seats were comfortable. Would use EY again only if the fares are very competitive. Transfer to DXB with their shuttle bus smooth both ways. However AUH airport is crowded and a bit confusing.

### Etihad Airways customer review
I flew from Milan to Abu Dhabi which is my first time on Etihad. The ground crew were very helpful in clarifying my doubts about excess baggage and gave me some time to transfer some items to my backpack. The onboard services were worth the money and the crew quite fast in helping. Flight was on-time arriving even though it departed 15 minutes late from Milan.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Excellant on outbound and return flights. Food and drink onboard very good, staff at check in, lounges and onboard were courteous and friendly. Seats were comfy and certainly better than economy, just don't expect a lay flat double bed!

### Etihad Airways customer review
I traveled on Etihad for the second time from HYD to PEK on a part of a business itinerary from Seattle to India and China, a business trip arranged by my work with couple of other travelers. This time Etihad ground handling didn't fail to disappoint. They offloaded my checked in bag in AUH and it reached one day after I landed in PEK. I had to continuously call ground handling to get updates. Etihad Airways bag tracking site didn't have any updates until the bag was delivered to my hotel. Cabin services are good in terms of food, legroom and staff, but that doesn't do you any good if they can't get your bags on the same flight.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Munich to Cochin via Abu Dhabi on 10th June 2015 and return Cochin to Munich on 14th June. On the first leg of my journey, I literally had to run to the gate for my second flight and I almost reached at the nick of time. The connection time was around 1.5 hours and my baggage was missing at Cochin. However, airport staff made arrangements to record my details and it was home delivered after almost 40 hours. I found out that the baggage of almost 15 to 20 passengers was not transferred to the second flight in Abu Dhabi. I thought this was a one-off incident as it was the first time ever my baggage was lost. On the second leg of my journey, my flight was to depart from Cochin at 4.40am on 14th June, but the flight arrived at around 5am and departed at around 6am. I was pretty sure that I was going to miss my flight as the connection time was again around 1.5 hours. I missed my flight and I was given a boarding pass for the next flight which departs at 2.10am on 15th June. This was almost 18 hours at the airport. I was given meal vouchers and a facility to sleep in a sleeping pod. The staff at the transfer desk said that they don’t have enough resources in the airport for staying and therefore gave me the sleeping pod. In fact I found that they have an airport hotel, which they could have made available for hapless passengers like me. I was not the only one and many like me were stranded. Etihad was handling this procedure of managing stranded passengers so efficiently that I think that their stranded-passenger-management system is much more efficient than their airline management and scheduling system. This seems to be a routine procedure for Etihad. I boarded my flight and it reached Munich and I was more than unpleasantly surprised to find out that my baggage is missing again. I got my baggage a few days later. The air stewardesses were a grumpy lot, maybe they are overworked, I don’t know. The food and service was not good and this is a completely overrated airline.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Lounge: it was very crowd to say the least and had to wait to jump to a empty seat. Food quality and variety is below par (compare to Emirates lounge). Boarding was smooth but as usual it was fashionably delayed by 30min. Cabin with narrow business class seats and feels squeezed even though I am a petite person. Cabin staff one of the most uncaring bunch of people. Not sure where they get trained and they seem to select passengers to whom they like to give attention and care. This was not the first time but I have raised this with Etihad customer care which also went unnoticed. Many times they forgot or ignored requests for service and acts as if they are doing the passenger a favour! Food excellent. Arrival delayed but the journey was smooth. I wish I could fire Etihad cabin crew and get crew from Qatar Airways or Emirates! Rating down by 4 notch due to this.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Have flown Etihad for many years. My last trip has made me somewhat less enthusiastic. Issues started when I went to KL Ticket Office to change my flights. They changed flights for GBP300 per seat, used to be GBP175 and told me I could no longer have a car from Heathrow to my home at the end of the journey. I explained that I was offered a car when I made the booking, but they said the fare rules had now changed and I was no longer entitled a car. After much complaining and nearly an hour waiting I finally got to speak with the local General Manager. I again stressed I had been offered a car when the booking was made, so I felt they could not simply change the rules. Eventually after 4 days of back and to emails, they confirmed the car from Heathrow. Check in is always a disaster, ditto the Lounge they use. With a couple of flights a day and now with First Class they should either choose a new partner or open their own lounge. The Emirates Lounge is fantastic at KLIA. Flights okay, service and quality of food definitely on the down swing. It's okay but used to be great. Bigger planes mean less attention for passengers which is were Etihad scored in the past. A re-think maybe, before Qatar Airways or Emirates (even BA) start to steal your premium passengers on this route.

### Etihad Airways customer review
This is the first time we have flown with Etihad Airways and it will be the last. Manchester to Phuket in March, returning 20th June. Both times transferring in Abu Dhabi. Not impressed with either the airline or Abu Dhabi Airport. Our transfer time outbound was 1.5hrs. Very long taxiway, then bus to the terminal. After passing through security "last call" was being announced for our flight to Phuket. And we still had to run from T1 to T3. Somewhat better on the return trip, with just over 3 hours transfer time. At the time of booking our flights we were informed that it would be A330s all the way. But 3 of the 4 flights were changed to Boeing 777's, one of them without informing us. Seating on the aeroplanes was not good - cramped, not much leg room. Cabin crew were not at all friendly, in fact, rather surly. Food was far from good, in fact inedible. The only thing we can't complain about - no delays - all flights either on time or early. However, on arrival back in Manchester 1 suitcase did not arrive. At least 4 or 5 other passengers from the same flight experienced the same thing. In fact one told us that he had flown with Etihad 3 times in the last 2 weeks - each time at least 1 bag was delayed. I can update progress, having just rung Etihad, the lost bag arrived on this morning's flight. Will hopefully arrive by courier later today. We had to ring them, the website was no help at all.

### Etihad Airways customer review
On 15th June I flew Etihad Airways Frankfurt to Kuala Lumpur via Abu Dhabi. Their inflight entertainment was good and the new soft neck pillow was a nice touch to help sleep during the long flight. I found that the food quality has deteriorated considerably from last time I traveled Etihad, not too long ago. The portions were small and the food was not tasty. Just before landing a muffin was offered with tea or coffee. This seems that the airline is cutting cost on their food. The crew seemed to be friendly and attentive. The transfer of passengers from the plane in Abu Dhabi to the main arrival hall in a bus is very uncomfortable because in sweltering heat it is hard to walk up to the bus especially for the elderly. I hope Etihad takes into account these points if they care for the economy passengers.

### Etihad Airways customer review
The flights I paid for were Muscat to Abu Dhabi, Abu Dhabi to Rome and Rome to Florence. I was forced to fly on Air Berlin Abu Dhabi to Stuttgart (modified without any explanation) and Stuttgart to Florence (modified). It included low cost longer flights and intermediate technical stopover in Bucharest. The Air Berlin Abu Dhabi to Stuttgart was the worst flight I ever experienced. Airplane was old, uncomfortable, with features which were common in airplanes of 90s. As my ticket was paid to Etihad I charge them responsibility for it. I have never been given any explanation. I guess that it was due to a mix of overbooking and lack of care to the people whom are flying in economy class. I will never fly Etihad again.

### Etihad Airways customer review
My flight from Tokyo Narita to Abu Dhabi left on time. The food and service was good, and the economy seat was comfortable. Would definitely recommend Etihad Airways on this sector.

### Etihad Airways customer review
I traveled twice this month with Etihad and I feel I made a bad decision. A list of whats bad is much longer than whats good. In short, poor products, service, impolite cabin crew, inadequate food, delayed flights and cramped seats made my experience very bad. While booking through their site, it hung up half way and did not continue. Restarted and tried again twice, again it did not work. I had to call their call center and complain, them book on the phone. I was travelling with an infant. No infant bassinets were available on both trips. Its an easy excuse for them to say "first come first serve basis" and "limited bassinets available". What's the point of advertising a nanny when even bassinets are not available. On the flight the flight was delayed departing the gate by 40 minutes. To add insult to injury, the temperature was far too hot. Every few minutes there were loud announcements that woke up all sleeping babies. The meal was limited and very ordinary for a "premium" airline. The quantity was less too. The cabin crew on both trips were neither helpful nor knowledgeable. I asked for vegetarian food and was given an omelette, despite me having made a request for vegetarian meal without eggs during reservation. When I pointed this to the cabin crew, the purser was very casual and unprofessional with his response. The entertainment system did not work for 40 minutes for no one in the flight, it only displayed route map and nothing else. The collection was not impressive either. I called the cabin crew multiple times, they said they would come back, but didn't come back. In Dubai I had to wait 3 hours for the shuttle bus. The seats were very cramped. Small narrow bodied planes not comfortable to get in or out. During my onward trip, it was ridiculous to see that the bus we were transported from the terminal to the plane was the last one, despite being told that we were given a priority as we had infants. The bus with infants were the last to board.

### Etihad Airways customer review
I flew a few months ago and chose Etihad because they were the cheapest airline. When we arrived at the airport we were greeted by friendly check in assistant - we had no reserved seats like we had asked for at booking and they changed our seats with no hassle. Onboard the seats were comfortable and inflight entertainment up to a fairly standard quality although some of the selection was a little sparse. Abu Dhabi airport was not one of the most pleasant airports I have been through. On the next stretch of the flight there were issues in that the food service seemed unorganised and random with people sat right next to me getting served 30 minutes before I was and there seemed to be no system in place. The aircraft clean and modern. On the stretch back the service was spotty again. Overall the flight was very good although not without its problems.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Very overrated airline. Flight one hour late, uncomfortable seats, warm champagne and stingy food portions. The premium lounge at AUH was decent and crew service was ok, but in all other departments Etihad is disappointing. The narrow bodied planes used on Indian routes do not give a premium experience.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Seats are comfortable, staff are friendly and professional. Left on time. The only downside to this was that there were far too many announcements. On my flight back to Abu Dhabi from Kuwait, I was surprised to hear an announcement on the list of gates the transits will be at and to which destination. I do not know if those who are transiting will be paying any attention or remember which gate.

### Etihad Airways customer review
I have flown twice with Etihad in the last week. It was a complete disaster on both flights. Cabin Crew were unprofessional. English announcements were hardly understandable and they kept making announcements once every half an hour during the whole flights - which were both night flights! Neither sleeping nor watching movies was possible this way. Cabin temperature regulation was a mess - passengers in the first 15 rows could not take off enough clothes to deal with the heat while the others in the back were fighting for blankets, of which there were not enough for everybody. Fish for dinner was not cooked properly. Beer and white wine served at the same temperature as the coffee - ridiculous!

### Etihad Airways customer review
Twice now I have flown Etihad, booked on South African code share flights, it has not been great. On the first case I was booked business class, but when I got to check-in, Etihad did not have me on the flight list on a full flight, despite SAA being able to provide the codes. I had to wait until 40 minutes before departure to know whether I would be able to fly and then it was in economy class. I was promised follow up - the flight controller even confirmed my email address - I am still waiting. The second time, today, flight EY471 from Jakarta to Abu Dhabi was delayed by three hours. I fly a lot, and I know these things happen. The proof is in how the airline treats you when they do. I am carrying a letter saying that hotels are booked if the new connection required more than eight hours waiting time. Mine requires fifteen. As I could not access a hotel (transit hotel full and I need a visa for any others) I was given food vouchers and told to wait in the terminal. I had to argue for lounge access (this time I am flying economy, but it seemed logical as lounge access Appears to me a notch down from the promised hotel accommodation). I was told it is full. Eventually the desk took pity on me and granted me five hours in the lounge. When I got to the lounge, lo and behold, it was empty. And just now Etihad refused to renew my voucher - from the mouth of an uninterested and unapologetic desk officer. I was also sent to and fro from the SAA desk to Etihad to sort out boarding passes. I have flown SAA for many years, and with many of its Star Alliance partners. I have two thoughts coming out of these experiences, one that I would not choose Etihad or an Etihad code share flight ever again if I can avoid it: even if the in-flight experience is good enough. And secondly, SAA, this partnership and the systems that support it is not running smoothly. The protocols are not sorted. Fix it.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Flew out to Sydney from Heathrow on the 14th May and back on the 9th June. A380 for two of the four legs, (should have been 3 legs but Etihad changed the AH to LHR plane after we'd booked). Heathrow and Sydney lounges good, Abu Dhabi large and lacks sufficient showers. Food at Sydney was excellent, (first time that we've eaten in the lounge), but elsewhere was only adequate. (Why offer a fish main course on the flights which is not available by the time that you're asked?). Entertainment system broke down on two legs - but was fixed relatively quickly. Why do they insist on lengthy announcements during the sleep sectors? Generally FAs were less than friendly and efficient.

### Etihad Airways customer review
I was expecting something special on these flights and was not disappointed. On both legs I was extremely comfortable, well fed, entertained and  looked after. The chef on the Abu Dhabi-LAX flight was exceptionally service oriented. The lounge situation for first class passengers at both airports needs to be better, but that is a minor issue. In the front cabin, this airline excels.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Had two journeys with Etihad within 3 weeks and neither was satisfying. As I was travelling with a family member who is wheelchair bound, we requested to be provided special assistance. There was a ground staff assigned to help us when we landed in Abu Dhabi from Kuala Lumpur. He simply pushed my wheelchair bound family member as if it was a 100m sprint. Later we had to line up to cross security check, however he led us to cut the line which the security officer was not agreeable to and everything was such a mess and the experience was so unpleasant. The flight attendant was impolite as well. On the flight, there were a group of travelers that seemed new to flying. One of them was struggling to adjust his inclined seat while the stewardess spotted him. At first the stewardess asked him politely to adjust the seat. The man answered that he had already adjusted the seat by pressing the button. At the end of the situation, it was realized that the adjustment button was not functioning well, however the stewardess did not change her attitude. On the journey back to Kuala Lumpur, the flight from London to Abu Dhabi was delayed and caused me to miss the transit flight. There was a group of 20+ of us from the same flight stranded. The airline arranged a hotel for us, inclusive of shuttle and meals. However, the arrangement was poorly done. Little assistant nor direction was given and after we cleared custom, we were just left waiting in the lobby. It took 2 hours for the airline to arrange the shuttle to send us to the hotel and by the time we reached, it was already past 4am! Similar poor coordination during the pick up from the hotel as there were 2 sedan cars picking up 8 designated passengers and later the same shuttle bus arrived. We had all boarded the bus but the driver would not leave the hotel as he was told to pick up 21 passengers and 8 were missing (obviously picked up by the earlier sedan cars).

### Etihad Airways customer review
Flew on this airline on 2 legs, first is from KUL to AUH on a Virgin Australia B777 aircraft (EY411) with a VA crew. Seat is quite spacious and crew is rather decent as well and that goes to the food too. Only complaint is the IFE system which couldn't be turned on for the first hour of the flight but the crew did a good job at managing it by regularly updating on what they will be doing to resolve this. Next leg is on EY73 from AUH to ZRH on an Etihad A330 (EY73). All the reviews about seat being cramped in Economy are definitely true but I would say it's not totally unbearable given that I've sat on seats with similar width and legroom before. But I must say the amount of things they give to you (blanket + amenities kit + inflight magazine + duty free mag) does make the space more cramped than usual as you need somewhere to keep all the items in. Contrary to most reviews though, the crew is quite okay though maybe not as friendly as what you have on SQ or MH.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Just completed 4 flights on business class. All flights food was inedible. Quality of food has got worse but the fares keep going up! Ground staff useless as usual in Abu Dhabi. A queue for the toilet in the lounge! The whole airport is overcrowded. Cabin staff vary. One flight perfect, on the other three they looked overworked and tired but had plenty of time to chat in the galley. Airport transfers in Bangkok perfect but pick up in London was late. His response was nowhere to park and I should wait outside the hotel on the street for him! Lounge at LHR was another bad experience. A group of about 10 travel agents were going on a trip and were being taken care of by the lounge staff. I had to ask 3 times for a glass of water while they were being given champagne. Other guests that actually pay were being ignored, I have points that will expire this month and can not get a flight that suits my schedule.

EY 103 from Abu Dhabi to New York. I was a gold card member of Jet Airways. Staff onboard were rude service was awful and they only came to see you at designated times such as when they had to feed us. Other times you'd call them and just have to wait. If you wanted a cup of coffee they said that I would have to wait as they would be serving the next meal in 1 hour and I would get coffee along with that. I prefer airlines Airline who deliver service with a smile but on this flight it was angry service and a look of how dare you disturb them. Food served was ok but seats are very narrow and not good on long distance flights.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Trip from LHR - Abu Dhabi - LHR. EY17. Firstly our flight was delayed with no explanation given until we started boarding. Once we started boarding we were delayed further due to unknown issues. The flight itself was very average which surprised me seeing as Etihad puts itself as a leading airline. Service was slow and staff were a bit cold. IFE was average at best. Food portions were minuscule! I would not recommend flying this airline when there are far better alternatives.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Etihad Service started at the lounge in Sydney with an al a carte restaurant and waiter service for drinks. A small lounge but big enough a huge improvement on the Qantas Business Lounge. Both ways I was in the smaller business class section next to First Class which I much prefer. The service on the flights to Abu Dhabi and on to Athens then return were excellent. The meals appetizing and wines more than satisfactory. It was a flat bed so no problem sleeping a full 8 hours. The return trip was also pleasant and I opted to have dinner after a few hours of sleep. This was no problem. The staff tried very hard but did seem a little pushed to keep up the service on the return leg. I have no criticism and will most definitely fly with them again.

JNB-AUH-BKK-AUH-JNB. I don't expect a personal service in economy class but just observing the crew I got the impression that they do not want to be there. Food is inedible. I have travelled on many airlines but Etihad's food is by far the worst. If I could rate the food 0 out of 10 I would. AUH-JNB flight on an old Jet Airways aircraft .The only reason I travel Etihad is because I always seem to find the cheapest fare. I would not recommend otherwise. This was my 8th trip with them and I can only say that they are consistently bad!

### Etihad Airways customer review
20th April 2015. I flew from Manchester to Abu Dhabi-Abu Dhabi to Sydney return. I was very happy with the seating which I found to be comfy and reasonably spacious. The staff were pleasant and helpful and the food was adequate. The inflight entertainment was great. All in all great value. Abu Dhabi airport has an Irish bar where you will pay £7.50 for a pint of Stella. There is also a smoking room in the bar for those of you who smoke. On arrival at Abu Dhabi you do feel like your in a cattle market but once through passport control its fine. I would fly with Etihad again.

### Etihad Airways customer review
First time with Etihad. Flight 0454 Abu Dhabi to Sydney 13 hours. The flight departed 20 mins late but the captain explained the problem with traffic in the area. Face washes menus kiddies packs comfort packs with sox etc brought around. Real ear phones not plugs etc. I had seat 23 d on the B777 aisle seat with a spare to my right which was helpful. The cabin was neat and clean. The cabin staff were really good. Nothing was a problem. This is a long flight but staff came through every 30 to 40 minutes with water and / or juice. Drinks were served before the meal and with the meal. Meals were ok but I don't really eat much on long flights. I do enjoy a beer and had no problem getting an extra one or two as we approached Sydney. The cabin staff were friendly and attentive. I have flown with all other carriers on the Kangaroo route and on the basis of this flight I would rate Etihad up with the others. At this time they are very competitive so I rate them very good value. We arrived 30 minutes early.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Travelled from Australia via Singapore to Abu Dhabi last month. The flight over wasn't too bad and the crew were pretty efficient and pleasant but on the whole I thought it was a shabby cabin with uncomfortable seats that were almost impossible to recline in fact I thought they were fixed upright as no one seemed to be able to recline their seat. When we travelled back from Istanbul the flight was worse. Once again seats that did not recline without a real struggle and crew that seemed indifferent to the needs of passengers and they seemed to operate in a chaotic manner at meal times. We waited ages for the meal then didn't get the bread roll and after the meal were completely missed when it came to the longed for cup of tea. I had to ask for a drink of water once as they did not regularly come around and I felt like it was an imposition. Some of the crew seemed unfriendly and cold and it didn't make you want to use that airline again. We missed our connecting night flight due to a delay and the next day Etihad didn't put my name on the passenger list for the next leg home only my husband which wasn't ideal and took a long time to sort out leaving us to rush to get on the plane without breakfast or anything. Wouldn't go on that airline again too budget and not enough comfort weren't allowed to book emergency row seats either and my husband and I are both tall people.

May 10th Kathmandu - Abu Dhabi EY293. May 11th Abu Dhabi - London Heathrow EY019. I was in Nepal to provide relief aid after the earthquake and was asked to return on the next flight out of the country. Some people would be annoyed that the flight from Kathmandu to Abu Dhabi was delayed which subsequently meant that I missed my connecting flight from Abu Dhabi to London however I was not. The flight from Kathmandu to Abu Dhabi was great I can't complain one bit. I was given my desired seat there was even a seat left between me and a fellow passenger which meant loads of space the leg room was huge. Also as a fairly large guy I was satisfied that the tray wasn't balancing on my stomach for this flight. Once I landed in Abu Dhabi I just missed my connecting flight. The security team were very quick with the bag checks and everything so I can't fault them. I went and spoke to the gentleman at the transfers desk he put me on the next flight out I requested an aisle seat and was provided with an exit door seat. The flight from Abu Dhabi to London was excellent. I'll be sure to fly with Etihad again.

Flew from Abu Dhabi to LAX on code share flight operated by Etihad. Check in at airport was very cold and almost rude. This was a first the check in staff has been excellent in the past. Flight delayed with poor notifications. Crew was pleasant but not friendly. Service slow and food average with below average beverages. Wines are very cheap and low quality for business class.

My husband and I flew from Dublin to Perth via Abu Dhabi and back on the Airbus A330. From Abu Dhabi to Perth and back we had the same seats 31A and 31C. In 31C there was a terribly cold draft on the aisle seat which resulted in my arriving in Perth with the most severe sinusitis I have ever had and my right shoulder was very sore. I wore a long sleeved shirt a woolen jumper and had the blanket pulled up but despite that it was freezing. On the way back my husband sat in 31C and he had a T Shirt long sleeved shirt and woolen jumper and still had to get his raincoat down and wear that with the hood up. Other parts of the plane were not so cold so there must be a problem with the cold air vents blowing on 31C. It would be useful for one of your crew to fly long-haul in that seat so that you can get the measure of the problem. On this plane there are no individual air vents so presumably the cold air comes in at one spot and that must be just behind 31C. I would recommend this airline to others but not that seat.

San Francisco (SFO) to Bangalore (BLR) via Abu Dhabi (AUH). Price was reasonably low. Etihad maintained regular communication about my travel and allowed me to upgrade to Business class. I skipped that offer and decided to travel in economy class. The day before travel I did online check-in and printed my boarding pass. On the day of travel all I had to do was to drop my bags. I thought it was a simple process of dropping them off. No Etihad agent checks the cabin bag for its size and weight and it can not exceed even 1/2 pound. There was no delay in the flight. There was a 10 minute delay. However passengers were greeted by crew members and they helped me to place the cabin luggage. They were cordial and helpful. We were given a hot towel upon arrival as well as the meal menu card. Crew were very cordial and willing to help. After serving the food they ensured the blinds were closed and there was no service for next couple of hours unless called by passengers. There were some empty seats and I was quick to use them up. I was surprised when the crew handed over my special meals to my changed seat. Flight arrived at Abu Dhabi an hour earlier than scheduled and hence we got an extra hour to browse through airport shops. My next flight was in 2.5 hours. What I noticed is that no compliance to ADA rules for Seniors and others who requires wheelchair access to rest rooms or showers. Passengers have to climb three steps to use the rest rooms. The rest rooms at the airport were not clean. Maybe that's the standard AUH airport maintains. I boarded my next flight to Bangalore (BLR) and it was a smooth ride with a different set of crew and services of crew was excellent. I traveled back from Bangalore to SFO via Abu Dhabi and had an even better experience. Overall I am very satisfied with Etihad and would be happy to travel again.

We travelled from Manchester to Bangkok via Abu Dhabi. Long Haul flights are not the easiest but our flight with Etihad was more than acceptable. The staff were polite efficient and provided an excellent service. The inflight entertainment system was far more reliable than some other airlines. The food served was probably some of the best quality I have been served on either long or short haul flights. All flights were on time. The aircraft was clean and tidy and the pillows blankets and comfort kits were more than adequate. The new style pillows were particularly comfortable. Abu Dhabi airport was probably the only slight negative. We were crushed into a small holding space and let through into security a few at a time. It was far too small a space to accommodate the number of passengers passing through. Hopefully this will be sorted once the building work is complete. We have travelled long haul with various airlines in the past and Etihad rate up with the best such as Cathay and Singapore and rate far higher than Qatar Airlines.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Recently flew Manchester to Abu Dhabi and onward to Saigon Vietnam. I was shocked at the lack of legroom on these flights and found them to be very cramped and uncomfortable for a long haul flight. Incredibly the hours flight from Saigon to Danang via Vietnam airlines was much more comfortable. I think that Etihad would be far better spending money on improving economy class than paying Nicole Kidman to advertise the comforts of business class for the wealthy few. The food was somewhat poor as well. For the first time in 35 years of flying my luggage was not transferred onto the connecting flight to Saigon and I was without it for 2 days. Etihad needs to improve considerably.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Bangalore to San Francisco and back and faced lot of problems with the 4 flights (BLR-AHU-SFO-AHU-BLR). 1) 2 of the 4 flights were delayed and the AHU-SFO by more than 2 hours. 2) The inflight entertainment is average. 3) Food was ok. Nothing great but not bad either. 4) I fly economy almost all the time. Even by economy standards I found the seats in AHU-SFO sector to be very congested. It was fine in BLR-AHU. 5) The worst part of the entire thing was the staff experience. In the SFO-AHU flight at least 4 times I had the staff lady tell me "I will come back to you" when I asked something and then disappeared. This happened for simple things like water or when I asked her to take a used glass from my seat. Both times I walked to the area and got the work done. I normally choose Singapore Airlines or Emirates. I am sure I will fly Etihad again only if I desperately have to go.

SFO-AUH April 6 2015 EY182. AUH-KTM April 7th EY292. KTM-ABH May 2nd EY293. AUH-SFO May 3rd EY183. I flew from San Francisco to Abu Dhabi and then to Kathmandu and back to Abu Dhabi in Business Class. Then Abu Dhabi to Los Angeles in Economy class. My flight from KTM to ABU got delayed. They were kind enough to fit me onto a flight to Los Angeles the next morning and provided me with a voucher to spend a night at the airport hotel. I upgraded my ticket to Business class from SFO to KTM. Compared to other international airlines their service is poor in business class standard. It took 1.5 hrs to get my drink after the plane took off in Business class - KTM to AUH. On the way back I decided to try Economy class from Abu Dhabi to USA and found out it was the most horrible flight experience I had in the past 26 years flying back and forth from USA to other countries. Let me make it clear it was all about flight attendants. Sixteen hours of journey itself is not that easy. One needs to be hydrated constantly to keep with the long journey. However attendants treated passengers like they are looking for free food and handouts. It was the most pathetic scene. If they can not provide "free" food or drinks how about selling? I would be hesitant to fly with them again.

I recently flew from Abu Dhabi to Dublin return on an A330 (SYD-AUH leg operated by Virgin Australia also good). It had been many years since I had made this journey and after reading the predominantly negative reviews I was worrying that long haul travel had deteriorated over those years. Everything was however much the same. I think people need to realise that long haul in economy isn't particularly comfortable but you can make the most of it. I put it in perspective I had 14 hours with nothing to do but watch movies read books and drink wine. People brought me food and I didn't have to do anything for anyone else. No phone emails or pager to distract me. The aircraft was clean seats reasonably comfortable food was fine and the entertainment was good. The staff were friendly and check in and boarding went smoothly. The only glitch was that my bag got delayed by a day on my way there and back however I think that this may have been from the VA side of the operation. All in all pleasant flights.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Etihad Flight from Abu Dhabi to London last week was very poor. Old plane with little legroom (and we're only 5'3"!). Narrow seats and inattentive staff. We had enquired about the cost to upgrade to Business but no seats available. After a splendid Virgin Premium Economy flight Sydney to Abu Dhabi this flight two days later was a shocker. The pre-flight organisation at the airport was chaotic. We're trying to arrange an upgrade for the first leg home (Frankfurt to Abu Dhabi) and look forward to our Virgin Premium Economy Abu Dhabi to Sydney two days later. This poor service at airport and on flight was astonishing because Abu Dhabi itself was enjoyable - neither chaotic or disappointing.

7 Feb 2015 MAN-AUH EY16. 8 Feb 2015 AUH-SYD EY464. 27 Feb 2015 SYD-AUH EY451. 1 Mar 2015 AUH-MAN EY21. For all the hype about their premium products their Economy product is nothing short of dreadful. We chose to fly Etihad with our 2 young boys (3 and 1 years old) from Manchester to Sydney because of their so called "Flying Nanny" service. Unfortunately we felt let down by the lack of attention our children got from this apparent qualified nanny who seemed on most occasions to be missing in action and when this Nanny was about she seemed less than enthusiastic wanting to interact with the children. I thought nannies were supposed to actually like children. Now I know food on airplanes isn't supposed to be amazing especially in economy but the matter they classified as "food" was about as tasty as a smelly sock after football practise in fact a more accurate description of what they were serving up would be slop with a fancy name. I'm pretty sure the sautéed potatoes was cardboard and that kofta isn't a sausage that has had the life shrivelled out of it. The drink selection wasn't better with a smorgasbord of typical commercial larger which leave a disappointing metallic after-taste. In total we flew 4 legs with this lame imitation airline and on each occasion we were delayed by an hour. That's 4 hours in total that. Part of the reason is a lack of staff at the check in counters and the other being the shambolic nature of Abu Dhabi airport where planes are parked willy nilly along the tarmac waiting for a gate to load the latest bunch of impatient and weary travellers while arrivals are ushered into buses like cattle and given a tour of the entire airport before finally dropping arrivals at their intended destination. All in all if you are a parent travelling to the other side of the world with your 2 little bundles of joy only fly this cheap imitation of an airline if it's the cheapest ticket you can find by a long shot.

I have used Etihad for years now but haven't traveled with them for the last 3 years. We booked flight MAN-HKT and PEK-MAN both via AUH. After reading the reviews on here I was wishing I had booked with Emirates or Qatar. I have since returned and couldn't really fault Etihad at all. What people need to realize when adding a review is that Long Haul travel in Economy isn't great its what you make it. All our flights were on time my wife got her special meals and I had one of the best meals onboard a plane. We had exit seats on the return legs that we booked and paid extra for in advance and this really did make a difference. They have introduced and new pillow that's amazingly comfortable and allowed me to sleep when I don't normally. We were very satisfied with Etihad this time the only let down was the congestion in Abu Dhabi airport its far too small now but you can see the new airport is well under way so this issue should be gone soon. Inflight entertainment is excellent lots of choice and many series box sets now.

I recently made a lightening trip to and from New Zealand to attend my mother's funeral. I did get rather confused at Heathrow and ground staff at Heathrow were extremely helpful they must have notified ground staff at Abu Dhabi as someone was there to meet me take me through security on to a lovely lounge and escort me back later to the aeroplane. This also occurred on my return trip when I touched down at Abu Dhabi on Fri 24 April. I will use Etihad when possible in the future.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Recently flew economy from Sydney-Tehran Istanbul-Sydney with Etihad and overall was not that impressed. On my first flight Sydney - Abu Dhabi I had selected my seat months in advance as I prefer the aisle then the day of check in I saw that I had lost my aisle seat and had been placed in the middle. I managed to get an aisle seat by checking online the next day but only by chance as my several calls to Etihad staff said that there was nothing that they could do about it. Check in staff was okay but pretty cold. In-Flight service terrible barely saw attendants and only two drinks services on a 14 hour flight. Entertainment system was okay but not as good as Emirates. Flight from Abu Dhabi-Tehran was better but only because I got upgraded to business. Return flights from Istanbul-Abu Dhabi and Abu Dhabi to Sydney were also pretty bad and the service left a lot to be desired. One thing that really annoys me is that on all of my flights they stated that the boarding time was one hour before departure but then you would get to the gate and only board 30 minutes before. Overall I would choose Emirates over Etihad.

### Etihad Airways customer review
I booked a flight to Tokyo at a discounted price an offer by Etihad Airways I came to know later that the fare price did not include the Chauffeur service which was bizarre and unprecedented. The seat I selected when I checked in online was given to an another guest which eventually they gave me the seat reluctantly. The seat was unbelievably congested for myself a medium sized person and I did not receive a personal care kit. The menu offers mainly Arabic and Japanese selections which I found lacking. It took the flight attendant literally an hour to serve me a bottle of water. I selected a Japanese breakfast and they served it promptly however the dishes tastes were bland compared to Japanese dishes I experienced later on my trip. Hence I was really underwhelmed by the experience but maintained my composure throughout the flight and really felt sympathetic towards travelers who were seated in the Economy cabin for 10 hours and surely they had their share of inconveniences. A disappointment for an airline who strives to be the best.

### Etihad Airways customer review
I had a return flight from Tokyo to Abu Dhabi and I was upgraded to a First Class seat. The 12 hours flight was my best experience to date as I was greeted by the flight manager seated and instructed to relax and enjoy. The seat was comfortable and spacious later on the flight attendant prepared the seat to be a bed which was on par with hotels beds and I spent 8 hours sleeping out of the 12 hours flight. The menu had exquisite selections and the in- flight chief made sure that the food was served promptly and perfectly. The food was a delight to have and memorable to experience. The flight manager was attentive and a good listener he literally meant his instruction to relax and enjoy. Ultimately the experience was overwhelming and sublime. I have had flights on First Class cabin and Business Class cabin but this is the first time I had really met with an outstanding hospitality. I am looking forward experiencing the same treatment and I hope Etihad Airways can make it happen on all of their flights.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Horrible travel experience to Toronto. Seat change multiple times. When I booked the ticket I reserved the 44A Window Side Seat and it was Confirmed. Boarding Pass confirmed and showed that I got that 44A. When I boarded the flight in Abu Dhabi I got Seat 44A and I was settled and waiting for take off. A few minutes before take off another passenger came and claimed that he had reserved seat 44A. Finally they asked me to vacate this seat just before takeoff. I was given another seat which was not a window seat. The new seat did not have the sound system working for the entertainment. Finally I was placed in seat 55A in the very last row seat close to the toilet and food preparation area. When the flight took off I tried to watch a movie the audio was not working for this one too. I moved to the adjacent seat 55B which was unoccupied however the audio did not work there either. I informed the flight attendant to reset the audio or do something about it however they looked helpless and were unable to resolve this problem. After the meal I tried to move to yet another seat (54F) this time to try to watch a movie but had to get up to make way for the original user who wanted to spread out and sleep using all the 2 seats I was once again forced to leave this seat. This entire experience was very frustrating. Entertainment system is a very basic and fundamental thing on any flight. Looks like there is no procedure to ensure that this basic functionality is available to all the guests.

SFO-AUH-BOM r/t. Mix of Jet operated Etihad and Etihad flights (787) in business. Excellent flights. I am usually on OneWorld and prefer Qatar but was most impressed with Etihad. Not as flashy as Qatar in some instances but genuine sincere and excellent hard and soft product. The Jet flights have good seats - I was worried about the herringbone seating but was excellent. The 787 business studio is world class - first class quality and beats Qatar business. The food is very good - Qatar may be a bit better here and also in the amenity kits etc but Etihad flies first on most routes and Qatar does not so that may explain the difference in the business product. The lounge in AUH is good - Qatar is slightly better but Etihad has an excellent spa and the services are excellent and so is the food. Bombay lounge is the shared lounge and is excellent! The limo services on all ends is excellent- on time courteous and in impeccable luxury sedans. Very impressed and will fly Etihad again!

JNB-AUH-DUB. JNB-AUH: Priority check in at OR Tambo was quick. Priority boarding went quick too. The flight to AUH was the standard Etihad flight. The menu has not changed - this should be looked into. It was the Jet Airways aircraft with Etihad cabin crew. I actually like the Jet business class seats. I was in row K which is very private as it faces a wall. AUH-DUB: Very long queue to get into boarding gate at AUH - no priority line. I think it took about 20 minutes. This is unacceptable. Cabin crew were great on flight especially the senior attendant in business class lady wearing purple hat. She was always smiling and did her job great.

Flew Dublin to Brisbane. Check in at Dublin was fine. Lounge service in the Etihad lounge was very good and the al a carte meal choices prior to take off were very good. Staff very courteous and discrete. On board service very good. Flight was full food and drink orders were taken prior to take off and served individually after we reached the cruise. All very comfortable. Abu Dhabi airport is extremely busy when the morning wave of flights arrive. Good to see that the new terminal is taking shape in the centre of the airfield but it will be 2017 before it is operational. Still given the limitations and the use of buses to take passengers to and from the aircraft it seems to work okay. Flights from BNE to DUB were full. Very good service on board. Easy transit stop in Singapore and very efficient boarding process. Transit in AUH was easier as it was the second wave of flights at the airport and much quieter. However if you board through terminal 1 be prepared for a bit of chaos! Flight to DUB was good. I think that it was used as a training flight for three food and beverage managers. Can't complain too much as it resulted in good service.

March 26 2015 JFK-AUH flight 102 and Apr 4 2015 AUH-JFK flight 101. To AUH boarding was total chaos. Jet Airways staff were curt and not properly stocked. Had ordered kids meals for my 3 kids but none were given - I had to go up to the galley and ask for them personally. Food was well below my expectations. Returning AUH-JFK was terrible. Check-in took 45 minutes because the agent couldn't print our baggage tags. Boarding and the US ICE Pre- clearance was a breeze and we were among the first to board. My wife a doctor herself 6 months pregnant and traveling with a letter from her physician clearing her for travel suffered the most. Once onboard and in our seats a flight attendant noticed my wife was pregnant and asked for her letter. Flight attendant said that the letter was insufficient (remember that this was the return flight - had already been allowed to fly to AUH and had checked-in at the desk gone through two security checkpoints US Customs and the gate agent) and tried to kick her off the flight. After a ground crew member came to ask about our bags (to remove them from the aircraft) and realizing that they would have to remove 7 passengers and 14 checked bags they allowed us to stay but only after delaying the flight for an hour. Food on the return flight was terrible. Small portions poor selection (didn't give us a menu at all). Considering that the return was a 14 hour flight they should have given us more food during the voyage. At least the rest of the cabin crew was relatively nicer but not overly so. Lavatories were actually kept in decent shape and they gave us plenty of water to drink. Upon arrival at JFK the gate staff was rude pushy and noticeably cranky. Will never fly Etihad again.

Terrible flight experience. I was travelling alone with my 10 month baby. Hardly received any assistance from the staff. In fact the flight attendants were extremely rude and inefficient. The food was awful and service very slow. I had booked my journey allured by the fact that they have a so called "flying nanny" onboard which was totally non-existent. There were hardly any staff attending to our general needs. The experience at Abu Dhabi airport was a nightmare. This was a long journey from Kolkata to Chicago hence had to face a lot of hassle due to the poor service. I will not recommend any mother travelling alone with a baby to fly Etihad.

My wife and I travelled Business Class on a round trip from London Heathrow via Abu Dhabi to Phuket Thailand in March/April 2015. This was the first time we had used Etihad and we were delighted. Although the food on the outgoing trip was not quite as good as the return leg it was still very good. The meal on the Phuket to Abu Dhabi leg of the return journey was the best we have ever had on an airline and the service could not be faulted! The wine was excellent and included a Grand Cru claret. To top the whole experience off the service from the cabin crew was absolutely superb they could not have been more attentive and helpful. We shall certainly be using Etihad again.

Round-trip KWI-AUH-ORD. Great airline and the most comfortable long flight I have had. Why? Here's why. First starting with the ground staff who where very helpful and things got better when I got upgraded to B.class. On board the crew were very nice and attentive to details. Calling you by name is something that made me more comfortable onboard. The seat that turns into a fully flat bed is something I really needed and enjoyed during the long trip plus they had the perfect pillow. The food was good very well presented plus served with a smile. If I have to complain about something I would ask them to reduce the volume for the PA on board and to consider spices other than Indian spices in their food. Other than that things were great.

AUH is just a mess and confusing it's possible I would fly them again but doubtful. They would have to be 25-50% below anyone else's price.

First time flyer with Etihad Airways and last time. Flight EY461 Melbourne to Abu Dhabi economy. Can't expect too much but my wife and I feel short changed. Mad rush through Abu Dhabi airport queues all over the place just made our flight to London. Not enough staff in economy class 2 sometimes 3. Too long to get served. Hot refresher towels 2 hours into the flight. Meals too small in plastic trays. All seemed to be an exercise in cost cutting. Staff very indifferent to service and comfort. Return flight EY32 Paris to Abu Dhabi an hour and a half late leaving. Another mad rush to make flight at Abu Dhabi airport and then waited for over an hour in the aircraft before taxiing to take off to return to Melbourne.

HCM City to Frankfurt via Abu Dhabi. Flight left with over one hour delay connection flight was just 1 hr 20 mins later. Had to run through the Abu Dhabi Airport (people were holding papers with Frankfurt on it and the gate). When we finally arrived at the gate we were sent back to the immigration desk in the other end of the airport and the Etihad workers ensured us to hold the plane for us (14 people in total). We were waiting in front of the desk for over 30 mins and were them told that the plane left already. One of the worst services I have experienced!

AUH-BKK 6hr night flight on a B777ER. Dinner service took 2.5hrs to complete snack service 2hrs before arrival so passengers were given 1.5 hr to rest. Etihad Y class seats are probably among the worst in the industry very very hard seat pitch is a joke and you need a lot of strength to recline those few cm. Staff in charge of my section grouchy tired looking she was clumsy while pushing the trolley and pushed the trolley into my leg twice no apology. Overall very mediocre. No idea why they call the self the "worlds leading airlines" sounds like a joke to me.

We flew business class from LHR to Perth recently and back. Three of the four flights were ok but the Abu Dhabi to Perth was poor and disappointing. Abu Dhabi as a transit passenger is a nightmare but they seem to doing something about it. They make great claims about the food they serve but unimpressed. Won't dismiss them for our next flight but I will look closely at the competition and may move back to Emirates.

Etihad First Class JFK to Abu Dhabi on Jet Airways airplane. Am Gold Elite with Etihad. Only 2 people in F and not a great experience. Would not pay the same money on Jet as in Etihad. Boarding was chaos. No special announcement or queue for Business/First or Gold / Gold Elite members. Got on board no one came to see me and introduce themselves. Alone for several minutes. On board chef was very good though. Seats were rubbish. Scratched rugged not the glamour you see in Etihad's videos and on their site. Not leather but cloth. Things broken. Not a good experience. Food was 95% Indian I like Indian food but there must be more choice and variety. Service was not First Class. Un-attentive not engaging. Had to keep asking for them to clear plates provide drink etc.. Would not recommend the morning flight on Etihad/Jet Airways.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Abu Dhabi to Washington Dulles. First Class. Am on the plane right now using the wifi from AUH to Washington Dulles. It is on the new B787 Dreamliner. Major difference in a positive way to the Jet Airways experience 10 days ago. However this is still nowhere near the Asian airlines. 1) I cannot sleep although I want to. Not Etihad's fault but this airplane has the fancy "dimmers" on the windows. There is no window shade so I have the brightness of the moon directly on my pillow! Tried using eye shades and they worked for a while but the cabin will never be dark. Absolutely horrible design - everyone complaining across all cabins that can't get to sleep. It's like having a bright LED lightpost light on all the time. 2) Food: ordered rib eye medium-well. Came out super-well. Oven baked French Fries" are stodgy and not tasty. The beef jus was good. 3) Service is ok. Friendly but still a bit clinical. 4) Seats are fine and better than the Jet Airways cloth. The headphones though have a slight hiss. All in all would not rate this flight positively just because it is so hard to sleep with the light coming into the cabin. It's a 14 hour flight and a waste not to be able to get some shut-eye.

Fly regularly to Australia and NZ this was the first time I've flown with Etihad and I'm sad to say it will be last. The flight from UK left on time crew dismissive and rude to a number of passengers asking for water which although offered at intervals was barely 20/30 mls food on board variable some edible and some definitely not. My meal was frozen and they'd run out of meals. Seats hard narrow and very limited leg room I'm only 5'5 and my legs were cramped with seat in front resting on my knees! Toilets on plane were filthy! Abu Dhabi airport terminal diabolical busy disorganised staff struggled to organise passengers all passengers were asked to leave waiting area at departure gate twice before being requested to queue to go through security before boarding again. Compared to other airlines Etihad layovers are long my connection from Sydney was 8 hrs but due to no crew or plane available for final leg of journey. Further delay of 2.5 hrs no information or explanation given and no offers of refreshments while waiting at the gate we had been requested to remain at. Etihad flights appear to be competitively priced in comparison to other airlines flying to Aus and NZ but as the old saying goes 'you get what you pay for' and in this incidence it's so very true. Its a lottery with any airline and all airlines could do with improving economy class. Etihad more than most!

LHR-AUH and AUH-BKK. Not very impressed. Sure it is economy but I was expecting at least parity with Emirates (or Qatar) which must be the minimum standard Etihad sets itself by (otherwise what is the point of it). A330-300 on LHR-AUH and 777 on AUH-BKK. Both feeling somewhat tired but the A330-300 was superior as it has a two-four-two configuration. To top it off T3 on AUH was such a big disappointment. I could fly Etihad again if the price is amazingly better than anything else but £50 or £60 less is not worth the transit through AUH or the old looking planes.

EY401 15 Mar 2015 from Bangkok to Abu Dhabi business class seat 7e and 7f. Lots of crew but even during the welcome drink you sat for a long time with empty glasses in front of you. The middle row was served from flight crew from each side this means you receive service at different times. Hard facts like cabin uniform dishes etc are nice but we missed the personal touch with the service. During the flight it was not possible to rest at all. Flight crew needs more training to provide a more personal service. At Abu Dhabi Airport during boarding at the gate for our flight to Berlin there was a line for business class guests but this was flooded with y-class passengers. No way to get through to feel the privilege of travelling in business class.

I flew from Toronto to Abu Dhabi and two weeks later the reverse trip. I'll start by saying that I've flown a lot domestically in Canada and internationally though my two Etihad flights were the longest flights I've ever had. My previous longest flights have been in the six hour range to and from European destinations while my Etihad flights were in the 12 hour range. I'm 6' 3" tall so legroom is always an important consideration. The legroom on Etihad wasn't great but at the same time it wasn't bad either. When the passenger in front of me fully reclined my knees were just touching the seatback on an Air Canada flight several years ago I had to contort because of the lack of legroom on a flight from France to Canada. Regarding inflight entertainment there were enough movies and TV shows to keep me going when I wasn't dozing. I also really enjoyed the food as there was a selection of Indian cuisine throughout and I was never at a loss for drink including wine. On my return flight before we took off we had to return to the gate because of a sick passenger; this delayed things by about an hour and a half causing me to miss a connection in Toronto. Etihad put me up at the Sheraton hotel at the Toronto airport and gave me meal vouchers for the next day. I can say that they were very generous in that respect and they did their best to mitigate an annoying situation.

I flew Etihad 3 times recently all within 3 weeks and the last 2 flights in the last 4 days. From Amsterdam via Abu Dhabi and 4 days later back home. On my flight to Vietnam and on my flight back home I missed my connection both times because of technical problems with the airplane. I had on a 4 day visit to Vietnam 32 hours delay to spend at the airport. Even access to the lounge was not granted because the flight was "economy". No flexibility no help no apologies no feeling at all to make 32 hours waiting just a little more convenient. They just don't care. They have the reputation to be guest friendly but when something goes wrong they treat you as an animal and from that moment they are only extremely unfriendly not willing to help at all.

This is my first time taking Etihad from Singapore to London. Transit at Abu Dhabi. The boarding of plane went smoothly spacious legroom and seats feel comfortable. Meals were delicious flight departed and arrived on time. I will choose to fly with Etihad again.

LHR to AUH 27th Feb and return 9th March. Travelled as a couple out on 380 and back on 340. The 380 was superb - enormous and comfortable first class suite excellent cabin service from the chef and other staff and good IFE. Less space on the 340 and service friendly but slow as there were only 8 passengers in total to look after.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Manchester-Islamabad-return via Abu Dhabi. Wonderful experience once again. I am single father travelling with two little children aged 9 and 4. Flight nanny on Manchester to Abu Dhabi on 14th February morning flight was extraordinarily good and called my children by their first names. Food choices were very good and all four sectors were fully booked. Chicken option on Abu Dhabi Manchester route was delicious. Our flight out of Abu Dhabi to ISB had to return back to Abu Dhabi due to some technical fault (one hour inflight) but hats off to Etihad for arranging a new aircraft by the time we landed in Abu Dhabi. The new bridge at Abu Dhabi is very convenient. Security was smooth on all sectors. Etihad ground staff at all airports were very friendly and generous. The fare was very reasonable although I booked this flight 5 months in advance. I recommend Etihad to others and will continue to fly with Etihad. Inflight entertainment needs to upgrade but still worth watching.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Flew from AUH to LAX on March 4th 2015 with wife and kids. None of our overhead reading lights worked and we were told to keep the window shutters down so others wouldn't get "disturbed". Had a difficult time explaining this to my 4 year old who wanted to draw and color. There seemed to be only 2-3 stewards for the entire economy class. We had requested a child's meal for my daughter but apparently the request never made it to the airlines. The baggage claim at LAX is half a carousel for an international flight.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Flight EY11 18 February. This was the fourth leg of a holiday each flight with its own problems Etihad are getting worse every time I fly with them. This left late as almost every flight does now (previously causing a loss of connection) on this particular leg I was the fifth person asked what I wanted from the menu only to be told that out of three choices this was not available. The entertainment gets less and less and the music selection is non existent consisting mainly of a few compilations. Also they are now trying to avoid giving out fast track cards at London. You almost have to have an argument to get one. I used to have a gold card with Qatar and if they offered me one now I would switch back to them.

Flight from AUH to Delhi on EY224. Flight was slightly delayed. The business class cabins have few flight attendants making service very slow. Food is below average for business class on this flight. It has been better on other flights. Seats are designed for people under 6 feet. Baggage delivery was fast. Prices are much higher than other airlines but you get a direct flight.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Delhi to AUH on EY223. This flight was very delayed with poor communication. Service is slow food was typical for Etihad but average for business class. Bags were slow to arrive. This is the 6th flight in 3 months and convinced me of their consistent poor service. 1/6 flights not delayed.

### Etihad Airways customer review
EY103 First Class from Abu Dhabi to New York. Even though Etihads logo and livery on the metal everything else is from Jet Airways including staff food beverage entertainment system seat and cabin design. Since I am a big fan of EY and didn't expect wet lease service the whole experience was quite disappointing. First of all the menu was all Indian dishes. The onboard chef was apologetic that there was no western food to offer. Beverages were also limited. Amenity kit is non-designer brand and in poor quality. PJ's are again non-designer brand and its material was quite hard and thick. The seat is spacious and fully flat in a private suite. The cabin design is not as swanky as the standard Etihad First class product. The crew were generally friendly but slow to fulfil service requests. Etihad should enhance hard product and service quality of this flight to the same level of the rest of their flights. First class lounge in Abu Dhabi is crowded but service and food is great.

### Etihad Airways customer review
This flight was Amsterdam - Abu Dhabi but I fly regularly from Abu Dhabi around the ME usually 2 or 3 times a month. In the air Etihad are usually OK. Nothing special but OK. On the ground they are one of the worst airlines I experience. This applies to the online booking process online check in at the airport departing and at the airport departing. It is very clear their management have never tried to use their website or travelled with the bulk of their passengers at the back of the plane. On the rare occasions when their website works at all it is usually wrong or fails later. Information at the airports is non existent and passengers are treated as a major inconvenience to the staff. The frequent flyer programme is appalling. Usually wrong often missing flights. When you try to claim lost miles you get an automated message saying they will respond quickly then wait months for anything to happen. Again it is obvious they don't want to provide what you are due. There is never any sign of management in customer facing roles just a group of people who have no power or responsibility. Finally they are always shouting about being the best airline in some poll. Who do they think they are kidding?

### Etihad Airways customer review
I travelled to Sydney from LHR and was upgraded to 1st class. Excellent seat cabin crew food and drink. For the return journey I travelled business class. The seat from SYD to Abu Dhabi was somewhat cramped. Only 4 seats across the width of the plane yet they had managed to clutter it with so much equipment it was a little uncomfortable. The A380 from Abu Dhabi to LHR was totally different and was a real pleasure. I particularly like the bar area where one can chat with other passengers. The service from the cabin crew on all stages of my round trip was excellent and the lounges were first class. I would certainly recommend Etihad.

### Etihad Airways customer review
MAN-AUH-BKK. 777-300. Reasonable priced flights no issues with delays or with change over at AUH. Food volume and quality was acceptable as was the IFE. However the seating was very poor we were in a row of 3 as a family and could not get comfortable. The seats had the wrong profile were too hard and too narrow and the leg room was shocking. Travel to Thailand and the US regularly and of all the airlines we have used these seats are by far the worst. Even Ryanair has better seat and we all now how much they like to cut costs. It would put me off travelling with them again however the key factor for us is price.

EY48/EY270 DUB-AUH-MAA. Traveled with family. The disappointing thing is we booked kids meal which were not provided on both legs. Cabin crew in DUB-AUH flight was not friendly and helpful. But the flights were on time and entertainment was not bad.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Travelled Lagos-Abu Dhabi-Jaipur-Abu Dhabi-Lagos in Dec 2014. Overall experience was OK. Abu Dhabi international airport needs serious up-gradation as it simply does not have enough seats to handle growing transit passengers. Flight from Abu Dhabi to Jaipur was done with a smaller and out dated aircraft. Return flight from Jaipur to Abu Dhabi was delayed by 10 hours and no accommodation was provided. Had to wait at the airport only and found it very hard to locate a comfortable seat. Check in gates changes frequently without any proper prior information. Boarding at Abu Dhabi airport was completely chaotic. Flight attendants were courteous although not very helpful.

### Etihad Airways customer review
EY203 / EY183 BOM-AUH-SFO. Both legs were disappointing. The BOM-AUH portion was on a narrow body aircraft seats didn't fully recline. Its competition flies more comfortable wide bodied aircraft. AUH-SFO was also a disappointment relative to expectations. This was essential a Jet Airlines flight - using its aircraft its staff (except for a few Etihad attendants) and its catering. The only Etihad part was the entertainment system which was fabulous. As a Jet Airways flight it was good - but my expectations were of an Etihad flight. Etihad has heavily promoted this flight in advertisements and on its website - what was offered was far different than what was being advertised. It was a Jet flight. The plane was configured in a "herringbone" pattern for business class - a configuration that i find claustrophobic for an 16+ hour flight. Its highly rated cuisine was not on board - there were no Arabic dishes offered. At Abu Dhabi you clear US customs and immigration. While this in theory is great in practice it is far from it. They request that you be there 90 minutes in advance of its scheduled departure. Unfortunately once you get past immigration you are stuck in a rather bleak boarding area with no shops or lounge only a small canteen. All-in-all a underwhelming experience.

### Etihad Airways customer review
JFK to Bangladesh. Flight from JFK to Abu Dhabi was acceptable. The crew were helpful especially since we were traveling with a 5 month old. Check in was a breeze the crew were great helping us take turns so that both me and my wife could have our meals while the other one kept the baby. The food was below par. The next leg of the flight from Abu Dhabi to Dhaka was deplorable. First of all checking in was annoying. Another thing that stuck out to me was yes they had a lot of multi-lingual crew members but if you are headed to Bangladesh it probably would help if someone inflight spoke Bengali. On our way back check in was again easy and that's the only good thing that I can say about our return flight. Inflight service was horrible on both legs of the flight. We were flying on Jet Airways not an Etihad carrier and the crew did not know the first thing about customer service. On the longer portion of the flight from Abu Dhabi to JFK after the first two hours of the flight all the crew had vanished and the only way you would see them is if someone rang the attendant bell at their seat. Overall I was very disappointed with the service.

BNE-SIN January 15 Economy Class. Smooth check in and quick boarding. Asked if any extra leg room seats available before/after take off and received bulkhead seats. Excellent service from crew. Food and beverages fine. Entertainment acceptable for 7hr flight. Left a little late and arrived early. All in all very good flight.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Overall very good flight experience (Between US-India-US). Staff very courteous and attentive. Vegetarian food was very tasty from Chicago to Abu Dhabi but bland from Abu Dhabi to LAX. Seating arrangements - above average. Lay over at Abu Dhabi while returning to US was 8 hours and no place to sit or relax for a quarter mile long line of gates. Rest rooms-very clean. Limited number of many midsize coffee shops.

LHR-AUH-KUL 26/1/2015. Lounge refresh at LHR good though quality and choice of food seems to have dipped a little. First Class LHR-AUH was excellent good food and beverages good and standard of service without fault. AUH-KUL tragic. Night and Day with LRH-AUH sector. If you don't like serving people then don't work in the service industry. The FA's totally bad attitude ruined an otherwise acceptable flight though the Chief Steward did all he could to correct the problems and was very apologetic. Will continue to recommend Etihad as aside from the odd hiccup they have an excellent product at a very attractive price point.

EY1401 EY1402 EY430 EY431. Flight TXL-AUH-HKT-AUH-TXL. The only thing I was unhappy with was the delay (over 4 hours) with the aircraft on the route AUH-HKT. A good airline for a reasonable price.

### Etihad Airways customer review
1) I was traveling alone with a 6 month old baby and during check-in they did not allow even 500gms of excess baggage. Since I had all my baby items we paid extra $50 just for just 500gms of excess baggage. 2) I checked in and was waiting for my flight when Etihad personnel came and asked me to weigh my hand baggage. Since I was traveling with a baby and had to carry the milk supply required for whole flight journey (24 hours) the hand baggage was excess. They insisted that I could not board the flight unless I reduced my baggage to 7kgs or pay $150 for excess baggage. Finally after a lot of drama I reduced my baggage to 7 kgs in order to board the flight. 3) Etihad claims that they have a flying nanny on long journey flights to assist people traveling with infants. This was the main reason why I booked Etihad. However there was no nanny service for my flight from SFO to HYD. When I had to use the washroom and asked an air hostess to stand near my seat in order to keep an eye on my sleeping baby she was gone by the time I came back leaving my baby alone! 4) Seats in economy class are very narrow. I am a person of lean build but still these seats are hardly comfortable for me. Very tough for long journeys.

### Etihad Airways customer review
MEL-MUC and ZRH-MEL in Economy. After reading some of the negative reviews about Etihad I was a bit worried how the flights would go as I had not flown with them for many years. Fortunately however Etihad exceeded my expectations. A standout on all four flights was the very friendly and obliging cabin crew. They really went the extra mile and are as good as any other airline I have flown recently including Emirates. As mentioned by others the seats on the 777 are uncomfortable after a few hours and the food quality varies but overall I was quite satisfied with Etihad and would fly them again.

### Etihad Airways customer review
SYD-AUH-GRU R/T. Overall a disappointing experience with Etihad. We flew with our infant and had seen before buying the tickets that they provide an Inflight nanny service (Flying Nanny) on all flights so if you need help with your children they will be there to assist (major selling point). How wrong we were! There was no meet and greet onboard with the nanny and very little assistance (if any) was on hand while in flight. More assistance was given by fellow passengers when the wife was travelling alone with him on the first two sectors. AUH-SYD leg there were 6 infants in the small front economy class section of the 777 and not once did I see the nanny there. I did see her in the rear galley when I wanted the bottle cleaned but she was more interested turning her back and scoffing down her meal while a flight attendant helped. At Abu Dhabi there was no special boarding for infants or children. Meals seat and inflight entertainment were average at best. I couldn't find anything outstanding with this airline except it was the cheapest price we could find on this route. We have vowed not to fly with Etihad again.

### Etihad Airways customer review
I had a very bad experience due to delays in flights and no proper solution to issues. However as a frequent flier I would say even without delays the business class service was very sub par. The food was awful and we were never asked if we needed anything. Please note I was travelling with my whole family in business class. I must also say that on the to flight the staff were excellent however on the return flight definitely some improvements need to be made. I fly Cathay regularly and there is no way Etihad competes with the care of the Cathay staff. Please also see below full detail of other situations we faced. Due to delays we missed our direct connection from Abu Dhabi to Chicago and then were booked on a flight from Abu Dhabi to Washington DC and then from Washington DC to Chicago. Usually when this happens an airline upgrades you however not in this case. What is worse is that at my seat the entertainment system did not work properly and needed to be re-booted over 5 times. Please note not once was asked if I wanted to change seats. I was also flying with my 2 young children. We originally bought business class tickets. On the 7pm flight there was a first class however Etihad booked us in Economy. Due to another delay we missed the original re-booked flight from Washington DC to Chicago and were told we were re-booked on a flight which leaves 3 hours later. Upon arrival in Washington DC I asked if we could use the United lounge as I was with my family and stuck in the airport for over 3 hours at no fault of our own. I was told to "calm down" and was refused. For a flight which was supposed to arrive in Chicago around 3pm my family and I got our final luggage at 11.35pm.

### Etihad Airways customer review
One of the best rewards programme. Excellent food lovely cabin crew most of the time. Ground staff are pretty decent too at LHR MAN DOH and of course AUH. Interior is excellent. flight times and waiting times between DOH to UK are usually fine. I only wish EY would fly to BHX directly so that my journey would be DOH-AUH-BHX instead of having to do the whole DOH-AUH-AMS-BHX. Still other than that I continue to fly with EY because of their good service and lovely rewards programme even if it does involve inconvenience. I highly recommend this airline.

### Etihad Airways customer review
London to Johannesburg via Abu Dhabi. I travelled with Etihad this time last year and was pretty happy with the service and thought it was good. I pretty much always pick the cheapest flight with the least amount of waiting so thought it was good. A year later I used Etihad again and I am not so impressed. Between the two Etihad flights I flew with Emirates which I found to be far superior. The staff were friendlier the seats more comfortable the food nicer and the entertainment far better. In that year I found Etihad to have slipped a fair bit. The service was not so great and staff didn't come round to offer drinks so regularly. The food on the Etihad flights is ok but there never seems to be anything other than curry! Even for breakfast there was curried chicken and the sandwich snack was the same! I didn't bother to eat because of this. The choice of entertainment was also very poor. There was not a vast choice of current films a choice of only 2 (old) documentaries and the music selection was really poor with no track listings or individual artists just compilations of various artists and no information. There were hardly any children's films either it was very poor.

Flew from Abu Dhabi to Chicago on the 777 business class. On the ground service with Etihad chauffeur provided pick up from hotel. Brought to separate check in for first and business and then escorted to the wonderful lounge. Great new plane with easy to use and comfortable seats and wonderful attendants. They even came to ask whether they could make my flight more comfortable? I can't wait to fly this airline again. Food service is excellent and on demand. You eat when you want. Service and product on this run is excellent.

Return flights from KUL-AUH-DUB on January 12th. Boarding in KL was hassle free and quick. Flight was with Jet Airways at 2.30am took off on time and light snack served. Cabin light dimmed until 2 hours before landing however flight attendants brought regular drinks through the cabin. Breakfast was fine as was entertainment. Flight attendants were professional but not overly friendly. Boarding for flight to Dublin was chaotic to say the least. Only one person dealing with approx 300 passengers until eventually 3 more arrived. Suddenly we had 4 chiefs and no one willing to do the basics of checking people through. Words cannot describe the inefficiency of what was happening. This meant after a bus ride to plane we were an hour late taking off. Welcomed on board by name by the flight attendant at top of steps. This set the tone for the flight with smiling attendants who were very obliging to every request. Food was fine and again regular drinks brought through cabin. Overall an ok experience apart from the disaster that is Abu Dhabi airport.

### Etihad Airways customer review
I would not recommend Etihad. I flew from Perth to Munich via Abu Dhabi and return. Food was generally terrible. All options were gone by the time they got to me leaving only fish which I don't eat. After a fuss they found me a no-fish meal. The hot food is served in a plastic-lined container the taste of which went all through the food. Every corner is cut with the airline. the hot towels are disposable they do not separate or recycle any of their waste the blankets are thin and small barely covering your arms. The service is not very polite and frequent. The cabins are clean and presentable but that's about it. It is a very cramped cabin and for the price which was more than other airlines that offer great service its really not worth it.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Travelled from Bangalore to Las Vegas on January 3rd. After a delay of 2 hours in Bangalore and subsequently 2 hours waiting on the runway finally reached Abu Dhabi 4- 5 hours later than scheduled. Subsequent to this was scheduled to flight EY 101 to New York at 12.00pm but the flight did not take off until early morning 2am. Apathy of the staff was appalling as there was no forthcoming information on the status of the flight actual reason for the delay and no arrangements made to comfort the passengers!

### Etihad Airways customer review
Besides the already stated problems of extremely bad seats and miserable service the airline has no sense of timing. We missed our connection from Abu Dhabi and to get an alternate route we were put onto a long endless queue with a lot of people in the same state. The connections that were found were through at least 3 stops when there were direct flights available. They did not offer a hotel room though meal vouchers were provided. The food on the airline caused a stomach bug which I am still recovering from and our baggage which incidentally were not re-routed like us made it to us a week later. The worst experience ever.

### Etihad Airways customer review
I am a frequent flyer due to work but this was my first and last time using Etihad Airways. I would say this was the worst airline I have ever travelled with. The planes are old and cramped the staff are unpleasant and the food terrible. My eight hour flight from Abu Dhabi to Dublin felt like days. I will be using more reputable airlines in the future such as South African Airways or BA.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Flew Etihad from Abu Dhabi to London on B777-300. Ground handling very good and cabin service excellent with nice mix of nationalities among cabin crew. However very disappointed with economy class seating. Seat was narrow hard and very uncomfortable. Good sized toilets though (BA please note).

### Etihad Airways customer review
Business class passengers boarded in the same crowded and uncomfortable bus than Economy not even separated by a strap. Business class seat is very uncomfortable (compared with other airlines such as British Airways Swiss United Airlines). Not very large as kind of "wall" next to each seat. Due to this wall you can sleep laying on your back but don't even try to sleep on your side you won't be able to fit your legs. This is very uncomfortable and as I said not that large for your arms. You just can't get comfortable. We waited a long time on the ground and waited 25 minutes to receive any information from the crew. finally took off with a 1.5 hr delay. Service was ok and food very good. Missed our connection ZRH-GVA and was told or to wait 7hrs for the next Etihad regional flight or to go by train. They didn't want to pay for a seat with Swiss that was departing 2hrs later.

### Etihad Airways customer review
I have travelled twice on the Dublin - Abu Dhabi Route in the last month the seats are tiny with very little leg room and I am a small person. On the 4 flights the food offered was awful so do pack a lunch for yourself and you get offered very little to drink a half full glass/cup of tea cola or wine. You have to ask and ask to remind them to give you another juice. The food trays were left for a long time before being cleared away. The staff were not at all happy either on the ground or in the air a smile and eye contact go a long way. Check in on the Etihad Desks in Abu Dhabi is very slow so give yourself plenty of time. One of the flights was delayed 3 hours with no meal voucher offered so I decided to use the Lounge but was told my Silver card could only be used in Terminal 1 I was flying out of Terminal 3! I never had an issue getting into a lounge in any other airport. Etihad Advertisement is great but the product or service is not great. Taking all things in it might be better to fly in and out of Dubai as it is only 2 hours down the road. All that glitters is not gold with this airline.

### Etihad Airways customer review
My husband our three small children and I flew with Etihad for the first time from London to Singapore with a few hours stopover in Abu Dhabi on Jan 1 2015. The cabin crew on the first leg of the journey were rude and seemed uninterested. The seats are small and there was no soap in one of the lavatories. I would not recommend transiting in AUH. The airport is crowded and filthy. Duty free and eating places are limited and cramped into one place. You could barely move. The food onboard the flight was terrible. I'm baffled as to why this airline is voted one of the best airlines. The second leg to Singapore was a much better experience. The crew were friendly and attentive.

### Etihad Airways customer review
LHR to Male via Abu Dhabi not impressed at all. Service was slow inflight entertainment poor comparing to other airlines food was good but on 1 flight they had run out options on 2nd flight had given the wrong menu. Abu Dhabi to Male was delayed with 1 hour once on board we sat on plane for another hour - during the wait no explanation of the delay from the pilot or cabin crew. As a result - we missed our sea plane and had to stay overnight in Male instead in the resort. Overall really bad experience. Wouldn't consider travelling with them again.

### Etihad Airways customer review
SGN-AUH-BRU on 02/01. Worst experience in my 30y plus frequent travelling. The flight departed SGN ca. 1 hour late which still left enough transit time in AUH. During the descend into AUH the cpt announces severe problems with fog and was ordered to circle till further news. On top the lighting system on the runways broke down due which further circling needed. After ca. 30 mins circling the plane is diverted to a nearby airport where we stand at the ground for 3 hours. We then head back to AUH (15 min flight). The crew assures us that no flights departed and all connecting flights would still be there. Ground staff guided us to the premium lounge at T1 where the desk clerk told us the BRU flight left already anyway and she would rebook us onto the next flight. Whilst I wait for the rebooking I see the original BRU flight appearing on the screens for departure 13hr. I notify the clerk who denies the screen data but confirms it after checking again anyway. It's ca. 7am at that moment. She tells us to move to the T3 premium lounge. The desk clerk there confirms the 13h departure and tells us to sit and wait in the lounge till the boarding is announced at gate 44. At that moment gate 44 shows boarding for Brisbane. The next few hours I check on a regular basis with the staff for any change (AUH is in total chaos at that time). Each time they confirm the details. At 12h still no boarding and we're told flight is further delayed but they will announce boarding in time. At 13h30 I go to the gate where the screen still says Brisbane flight is boarding. I ask the boarding clerk if BRU is next after Brisbane to which she tells me she is boarding Dublin at that moment and the BRU flight left 30 minutes ago. What happened then is just too much for words to describe. We ended up being moved to a hotel at 6pm rebooked to the next day's Alitalia flight to Rome with a connection to BRU. Arriving in Rome the next day it turns out we're not in the system for the connecting flight to BRU and both Alitalia and SN flights are fully booked. As a last resort I went to the Vueling ticket counter where they had luckely still 3 seats left on the 18h05 flight which I had to pay for myself. So instead of a planned arrival into BRU on 03/01 at 7am we finally arrived at 04/01 at 9pm. Needless to say without luggage. Unless the only other option is going by foot I will never fly Etihad ever again.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Flew with Etihad for the first time in December - Coral Economy - EY 401 Manchester - Abu Dhabi - Bangkok and l would never ever use Etihad again. Seats were by far the most uncomfortable I have experienced very narrow and hard. Sat on 2 flight cushions to attempt to ease discomfort but it didn't make much difference. We had emergency exit seats with extra legroom and just don't know how other passengers in standard seats managed incredibly narrow and I am slight build/slim - heard similar complaints from other passengers. 10 seats across - 3 each side and 4 in middle. Found some of the crew to be arrogant/rude. However was informed that with almost 400 passengers there was a crew of only nine in total! Food never good on airlines but this was disgusting! All in all pretty appalling.

Had 4 flights over Christmas with Etihad. Chose them as they were cheaper than Qatar my normal choice. Two moans - I had an outside aisle seat on two legs and it felt very cramped - a cleaver configuration but it does not really work. Came back from London on the A380 and was very impressed and had a window suite which was very good and private. Transfer through Abu Dhabi not too good compared with Doha. Etihad offered turkey on Christmas day flights which was one up on BA. Service was OK but they start well and then loose interest after the initial burst. Would use them again if I could get a window seat and a A380!

Flew from Abu Dhabi to Kathmandu. Flight delayed. Was not able to assign seats online or arrange for chauffeur service on line. Their website is horrible. Tried to call and took 1 hour on the phone to get seat assignment. Trip was delayed with no notice of delay. Cabin crew was average. Service was slow. Seats are not comfortable and little leg room for a business class seat. Easily the worst business class flight I have had.

### Etihad Airways customer review
We flew Geneva-AUH-Phuket and back in Economy over the Christmas holiday. The flights to Phuket were pleasant on time and smooth. Service is pleasant food is good and seats are cramped but not more than on other airlines. The way back was less smooth as the flight to AUH was delayed 5 hours due to fog in AUH and we missed our connection. Luckily we got another connection that left AUH to Geneva (also delayed) with a 6 hour transit. While I find Etihad a good airline the problem is the AUH airport. Almost all flights are served by buses there are not enough toilets and the food court offers average food. Also the fact that one needs to stop in middle of the night in AUH instead of going direct exposes the travelers to risks of delays and long transit times. Etihad is still far away from competing with Emirates and needs to focus on having a top quality airport which can handle all its passengers comfortably and fix the systems so that some simple fog does not shut down its airport!

### Etihad Airways customer review
I am disappointed with the service provided from Bahrain to Dublin. There is never enough time to catch the connecting flight in Abu Dhabi and most of the time it results in the bags not making it on the same flight. I was unlucky last week to have to wait in Dublin to collect bags that never made the connecting flight. I will not fly Etihad again by choice and would not recommend.

### Etihad Airways customer review
I have used Etihad many times in the past. My flight from Dublin to Abu Dhabi was good and the service at the Dublin lounge is up there with the best - the staff servicing it are a credit to this company. Unfortunately anything of quality was absent after that. Abu Dhabi ground service facilities attitude and bad manners is worse than shocking. Flight departure services for EY408 to Bangkok on the 27th December was an absolute nightmare. Sitting on a bus for more than 40 minutes to get to the plane another 20 minutes waiting at foot of aircraft to board a clapped out 777 which had only one stairway for as many passengers that this plane holds. It took ages to board. Then met by a surly unhappy looking crew that took little interest in their premium "guests" - seats worn and tired aircraft showing its age toilets filthy and unkempt. Flight late into Bangkok. The major problem using this airline is it's annoying inconsistency. Excellent flight service at both Dublin airport and onward flight. Nightmare from landing to arrival in Bangkok. Greatest comfort is I still have choices.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Not very good. Very poor information as the previous flight to Bangkok was cancelled due to a strike in Belgium. Called 4-5 times to finally get an answer. Service on board poor. Never had my meal preference (on both flights Brussels-Abu Dhabi Abu Dhabi- Bangkok) The flight back to Brussels from Bangkok cancelled - didn't received any info until arriving at the airport. Waited 6hr in the airport for another flight. I don't recommend it at all!

### Etihad Airways customer review
This was my second time with Etihad. The route was Lahore Pakistan (LHE) to New York (JFK) USA. I was quite happy with the experience from LHE to Abu Dhabi (AUH) and then AUH to JFK but on the way back from JFK to LHE it was a terrible experience. At JFK boarding gate nobody could hear their announcements as the speaker quality was very poor. Boarding process was not very quick and also they were not really good to handle ~ 250 passengers on gate. Although flight experience was OK from JFK to AUH but upon arrival at AUH they informed that flight from AUH to LHE is at least 12 hours delayed because of heavy fog at destination. It was quite surprising when they refused to provide any hotel room and asked us to spend the whole night in the airport. I had no other option except spending the night on airport chairs after a 13 hours flight. I would not recommend travelling with Etihad Airways.

### Etihad Airways customer review
AUH-IST return during Christmas. Due to the usual chaos at AUH airport during holidays early check in for Etihad guests was introduced just before Christmas. The deal was that passengers would be compensated with 5000 Etihad guest miles and extra an 5kg baggage allowance. I did it and was told that the miles would be credited within 24h - it's more than a week later now and still waiting for my miles. The flights was the usual Etihad standard total chaos at AUH airport uncomfortable and narrow seats non attentive staff and dreadful food (always the case ex AUH much better ex IST). I expect better from a carrier which claims to be the "world leading Airlines".

### Etihad Airways customer review
Flew Economy on 21 Dec Bangkok to Abu Dhabi (on Boeing 777) and then Abu Dhabi - Brussels (on Airbus 330). Having flown many airlines I found the Etihad experience very good. Indeed as many other reviews also underline the Boeing 777 had somewhat less spacious seats than the A330 but was nevertheless much better than many other (and more expensive) airlines. Flights were very smooth - cabin crew seemed to compete for excellence! Will definitely fly Etihad again.

### Etihad Airways customer review
This yearn we flew to UK and back and Koh Samui and back with Etihad. I don't think we did any sector that would be classed as good. The seats are small and uncomfortable the staff did not seem at all interested in the passengers and we had great difficulty even getting a second drink (would have thought we were alcoholics). On nearly every sector they locked off one of the toilets and this made it difficult as all flights were full. The galley is badly designed as people had to queue for the toilet in the galley which obviously made the crew a bit cranky when they were trying to put things away. I can never understand why they put quite hot curry on flights.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Flew EY48 (DUB to AUH) and EY416 (AUH to KL) on December 21st. Check in online was fine and was allowed to change allocated seats to a pair of window seats. Check in was very smooth and they checked our bags all to way to Penang even though our final flight was on a separate ticket. Boarding was very civilised. The flight to AUH was bumpy initially and the captain informed us that it would continue until the North Sea which it did and the crew went about their work. They were friendly smiling and engaging the whole way. Food was good and drinks were also good. Crew answered every call immediately. Only drawback was long bus journey to terminal building. Flight EY416 was with Jet Airways operated by Etihad. A lot of confusion having boarded the bus to aircraft and then waiting on bus for 35 mins and again a further 15 minutes at plane. Once boarded everything was similar to first flight although a marked difference in crew for who it was a challenge to offer a smile. That said they were professional in their approach. Entertainment systems on both flights were good with very good selections of movies and programmes.

### Etihad Airways customer review
EY016 MAN-AUH 19 Sept 2014. EY486 AUH-PER 19 Sept 2014. The seating for long haul cramped and uncomfortable. Cabin staff surly and unhelpful. Food the worse I have had on an airline for a long time and I travel every year long haul this is first time and last time with Etihad. The only saving grace was this flight was relatively inexpensive compared to other airlines so I suppose you get what you pay for.

### Etihad Airways customer review
BRU-AUH-SGN in business class. Etihad has a competitive price on this route but their product is just average and below the standard of e.g. Qatar Airways. Their business class on the A332 is fairly cramped both seat space and cabin space in general. Manoeuvring through the cabin trying not to disturb sleeping passengers is tricky and I'm just a 1.80m 78kg guy. That same average goes for the food served. Flight crew was friendly and efficient. But the worst is that you have to transit Abu Dhabi airport when flying with them. By far one of the worst airports I have ever visited and I travel extensively for the last 30 years. For some reason they forgot to install a sufficient number of toilet facilities resulting everywhere even in their business and first premium lounges for waiting lines of 10-12 people. That itself is reason to avoid any airline transiting Abu Dhabi.

### Etihad Airways customer review
AUH-PER. First time using direct service to Perth rather than via DOH or DXB. The obligatory 90 minute delay leaving AUH negated any time advantage however. Moreover the use of an A330 configured for European services makes for an uncomfortable journey for passengers and crew who appeared to have no dedicated rest area nor do I appreciate receiving the same meal for breakfast as was served for dinner. Only price will tempt me to use again.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Travelled from Brisbane to Singapore on Etihad in November 2014 flying economy. This is the first time I have travelled with Etihad and it will be my last. The seats must be the smallest and hardest I have ever sat on in an aircraft and the room was so bad it was impossible to pick up anything off the floor without belting my head on the seat in front. They were so close it was even impossible to stretch out fully. If I could give a 0 out of 5 for seat comfort I would. Service and meals were adequate and the inflight entertainment was the usual standard for international flights without being exceptional. Avoid this airline if at all possible - there are heaps more comfortable airlines to travel with. I think I would even prefer Jetstar to this one and I never thought I would get a worse outfit than Jetstar.

### Etihad Airways customer review
We travelled in business class on flight EY401 Bangkok to Abu Dhabi 8th December 2014. We travel frequently and this must be at the top of my list for rudeness and lack of professionalism from a flight crew. The cabin director seemed not to have any control or management whatsoever. The cabin must be among the worst for space and comfort. If you can get the same fare with another airline then I would advise you to take it!

### Etihad Airways customer review
We connected from our Bangkok to Abu Dhabi flight (EY401) which was horrendous. However we were pleasantly surprised by our flight EY45 Abu Dhabi to Dublin (9th December 2014). The crew were fantastic attentive professional efficient especially the male crew member. Nothing was too much trouble. The business class cabin is still one of the most cramped we have travelled in but the cabin crew made up for any discomfort.

### Etihad Airways customer review
I had not flown Etihad and booked Sydney - Rome return without viewing the reviews. A few days before flying I did read the reviews and was horrified and really worried! However on both outward and inward trips I can say that apart from the lack of legroom (this is true) I was pleasantly surprised by the cabin crew who were both friendly and efficient the meal choice the inflight entertainment and the on ground services. The seat itself was comfortable and I managed to sleep (it's a gruelling 14 hour flight). Apart from the narrow legroom I cannot fault this airline. It may not be the best but it's OK and well-priced.

### Etihad Airways customer review
I recently flew Etihad from the US to India and Maldives. Overall a very disappointing experience. While three of the flights were unremarkable / average for business class three of them were downright abysmal. Among other things Etihad doesn't seem to comprehend the concept of on-time departures - all six flights were delayed by an hour or more. Yes it happens but 6 times in a row?. The Jet Airways aircraft have seen better times and this is Etihad's way of making an entry into a new market. The airport in Abu Dhabi especially Terminal 1 is awful. Three of my six flights all international involved a bus service and a hike up the stairs. The flight crew were a major disappointment on most flights - they try but in most cases don't come close to the class and experience of world-class airlines (e.g. Singapore Asiana Cathay). In 20 years of flying for business I never had to wait 10 minutes for a flight attendant to answer a call. In the end my conclusion is that regardless of how much money Etihad spends it can't buy class / elegance - perhaps one day they will get close however I don't think that day is near.

### Etihad Airways customer review
I had the most disappointing travel experience with Etihad. I travelled from Jeddah to Narita and back last month and still regretting the decision to fly Etihad. The business class beds on the Abu Dhabi-Narita sector is the narrowest that I ever travelled in. What was most apalling and disheartening was the arrogant attitude of the ground staff on my return journey from Narita. As I had a 9 hour transit time in Abu Dhabi we had requested hotel accommodation. We had got a written confirmation that hotel accommodation was to be arranged on arrival at Abu Dhabi. However when we reached Abu Dhabi at 5am - we were told that there was only 1 room (we were 3 business class passengers) available! The staff refused to entertain or make any efforts - their simple response was their system says 1 room. When we wanted to speak to Duty Manager - we were told he will be available in an hour and will meet us in the Lounge. There was no sign of Duty Manager until 8am! We were finally given rooms in the Airport Hotel at 930am. When I sent a complaint on the airline website the responses did not even attempt to explain why they could not provide rooms after confirming or why the Duty Manager never showed up. Instead they appeared irritated by the complaint and added insult to injury by unilaterally closing the communication. Welcome to business class travel!

Never again. Brisbane-Abu Dhabi-Heathrow. 6 foot tall seats are absolutely ridiculously spaced. Staff beyond rude. Terminals at Abu Dhabi are awful. Will never fly again.

### Etihad Airways customer review
I flew from JED EY312 to KWI EY305 via AUH. The Boeing 777-300ER was from JED to AUH. The inflight service was excellent attitude of the crew was friendly. My stop-over in AUH was about 4hrs I went to the pearl business class lounge it is the most luxurious lounge I have been too. My next flight EY305 on the A340-600 which is unusual because Etihad airways operates A320s to KWI. EY305 was also fantastic. The only thing that I did not like is that the A340-600 seats are still the old business class. Overall I enjoyed my flight.

### Etihad Airways customer review
I flew from LHR to AUH in business with Etihad. It's been years since I have been to T4 and I was surprised with the changes and improvements. Check-in was super-fast. I was given an invitation card to use the Gulf Air lounge as the Etihad one is closed for refurbishment. Fast-track security was quick and I was airside in about 3 mins! Like most airport terminals there are loads of shops but I made my way to the lounge. The lounge was nice and I was welcomed at the reception desk and given a slip of paper with the wifi code. Plenty of space and great views of aircraft. There is a staffed bar and the barman was happy to mix up any cocktails if he had the ingredients. The champagne and port were both nice. The toilets seemed much better than the ones in BAs lounge in T5. In fact everything about the lounge - including the staff - seemed more welcoming. Lunch was being put out in the food area. Fairly good selection and it was tasty. I got to the gate after most passengers had boarded so don't know if priority boarding was used. Found my seat and was offered a choice of champagne water or fruit juices. Had the champagne and it was nice. I found the seat very comfortable. Food is served when you like. Mumm champagne served once airborne and it was cold and fresh. It did look like the individual cabin crew on each aisle were a bit stretched especially as each order is taken for drinks fetched from the galley and then served. Looked like a lot for the crew to do in a full cabin and with the result that it took a while to get topped up. The food was delicious. Just the right amount and very tasty. The IFE was ok. Arrivals at T3 was fine though the priority tags on the bags didn't seem to make any difference. I waited about 45 mins for my case. The limo service to the hotel was great. All in all a great flight and I'd definitely fly with them again.

Economy class from Abu Dhabi to Bengaluru. As I was in Dubai my pickup point was in Etihad Airways office in Dubai where I was able to check-in early with my baggage. Travel to Abu Dhabi airport in the Etihad bus service with the boarding pass. It was a 3.5 hour flight quality of service was good and the food was aesthetically pleasing. Blankets provided and inflight entertainment seats were comfy.

Roundtrip flight from Cairo to New York JFK with connection in Abu Dhabi. The problem happened with returning flight from JFK to Cairo specifically the second flight from AUH to CAI. The flights was supposed to take off at 00.50 24th November 2014. We boarded the aircraft but we stayed 2-3 hours due to fog after which we were transferred back to the airport. The fog cleared at around 7am. Nevertheless there was no real updates about the flight. The flight took off at 1:00 PM after 12 hours from the designated take off time. After 13 hours travel from New York and 5 hours transit in AUH was only offered a meal. No hotel provided. We were forced to wait 12 hours expecting take off at any time making a nap risky. I'll never book with Etihad again.

### Etihad Airways customer review
DUB-DEL via AUH. Staff onboard recognized me as a Gold member on both legs without prompting them which had been hit and miss last few trips. It is always a nice touch when they do that. In general the staff were all good - friendly helpful and professional. The flights were on-time and went smoothly for the most part. The only issues that I had related to New Delhi arrivals. For some reason there were no foreign entry cards available to any passengers on the AUH-DEL flight and I was told at the immigration desk that I had to get my own card fill it in and cut the queue again which made me feel uncomfortable. They should have these on the flight. I have noticed this issue before where sometimes they have the cards and sometimes they don't.

### Etihad Airways customer review
2nd time flying with Etihad and found that the seats are getting smaller legroom disappearing and squashing in as many people as possible into the plane. Very disappointing and uncomfortable flights. The food was disgusting and a lack of beverages was rather disappointing. The airline crew were in a hurry to get everything done so they could disappear.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Melbourne - Abu Dhabi to Frankfurt and return. The flight between Abu Dhabi to Melbourne return is long painful and uncomfortable. The leg room on this flight was terrible and I would hate to be a tall person. I will not fly Etihad again on long flights and would rather pay more money and fly a different airline. I think Business class would be the way to fly with this airline or if they had Premium Economy.

Overall very disappointed with Etihad service. The seats were uncomfortable food choice was not good considering 14 hour flight to Toronto. I found the crew arrogant and unprofessional. Etihad has stopped including wet tissue in meal tray a very cheap move by them.

### Etihad Airways customer review
First time flying Etihad. Took four flights in total Manchester-Abu Dhabi-Nairobi and back. Really pleased with all sectors of this flight. I had requested a special meal on all four sectors and this was served to me. On one flight the snack box contained meat sandwiches and I'd requested vegetarian - the flight attendant instantly swapped it for a crew vegetarian meal. I was really pleased with this. Flying Nanny is a great idea. Crew immaculately turned out. The service was great. All flights had blankets pillows full meal service (even on 4 hour flight). A world apart from US carriers and the budget airlines currently in the UK.

### Etihad Airways customer review
London to Brisbane on 6/10/14 and returned to London from Perth on 3/10/14. After reading some of the reviews on this website I was fearing the worst. However everything was OK. The planes left and arrived on time. The service was fine. Drinks were available when needed. The meals were OK - no worse that any other airline economy class. Booking in luggage was easy and the staff were polite. My only gripe was that seats on the 777 from London to Abu Dhabi were a little cramped and the flight was full. I am over 6ft tall but I managed OK. The big upside was the cost of the trip. London-Brisbane-Perth-London (4 flights) cost £753.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Sao Paulo to Abu Dhabi then Abu Dhabi to Mumbai. I fly United internationally a lot from the US so I was eager to compare my first Etihad flight. I was in Economy on the A340 for both legs. Things didn't start off well. The check-in process in Sao Paulo took a full hour. Told that their system was running extremely slowly that day. Both flights were late taking off. About a hour each. The communicated progress pretty well. Food was good headset very nice blanket and pillows good quality and the entertainment options were good. I lucked out and had an entire row of four seats all to myself so I was able to lie down. I was disappointed by one of the flight attendants during the service. Despite the flight not being crowded she was quite surly. Dishing out drinks without even looking at the passengers terse frowns all around. The other flight attendants were fine. United gets poor marks for service but I think the service I experienced on board was comparable or less good than what I usually get on United. It's just one flight though. They collected headsets and turn off the entertainment way before the flight ends - 40 minutes. I can understand collecting the headsets but why turn off the movies so early? Will I fly Etihad again? I don't see why not but it wasn't the most amazing experience. Perhaps my expectations were too high since I'd heard and read so many good things.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Perth to Sao Paul on Etihad via Abu Dhabi. Now economy travel is pretty basic on any airline. We had some positive and some negative experiences on this trip. The positives well the flight was delayed leaving Perth by about 4 hours how can this be a positive? Well flights can be delayed we received some food vouchers and when I complained about some consequential costs to us of this delay the customer relations people on the internet were very quick to respond and to offer compensation and they followed through. Negatives the communication at the airport could have been better (the ground staff were pretty invisible) all people want is some information about what is happening and know when the plane will depart having someone around taking the questions is the best way to keep people happy. The real negative was the legroom. I am comparing economy to the economy of other airlines on the trip we took and we travelled on 5 other airlines in economy. It makes quite a significant difference to the comfort of a long distance economy flight. The in cabin service on the two sectors was variable in quality and sometimes (in the evening ) you had to wave your arms to get some water or attention. It is a good airline and they were responsive to my concerns for which they get a 10 out of 10 but really tight legroom makes for an uncomfortable flight. I would fly with Etihad again probably not on such a long leg as Abu Dhabi to Sao Paulo.

DEL-AUH Travelled on A300-200. The check-in process was below average long queue with only 3 check in counter opened for large number of Economy Class passengers. The handling agent staff were poor - shabby uniform and very low on personality. The flight was on time. The seats were comfortable on-board mobile network throughout the journey wifi equipped. I received the special meal which I had requested at the time of purchasing ticket. Flight attendants were attentive and took good care of all passengers including kids.

### Etihad Airways customer review
EY130 and EY131. Etihad has 2 really great features that I'm not aware of from any other US-Middle East carriers. First if you buy a business class ticket there are times when you get a chance to bid for a first class seat upgrade. Maybe its for Gold members and I have upgraded with pretty modest bids. Second you clear US customs in Abu Dhabi so you enter the US as a domestic passenger. I fly out of Washington Dulles the absolute worst US gateway and not having to get stuffed in a "people mover" waiting a half hour for the entire plane to cram on the bus and then get dumped into immigration after a 14 hour flight is incredible. This airline has really improved dramatically. AUH airport has its issues including a new premium lounge that is still too small. Attentive staff everywhere.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Just returned from America via London 4 legs on Etihad business class. Quite disappointed no MUM champagne on any of the flights (food was very good) staff service was terrible. Offered nothing for 2.5 hours when we got on in Abu Dhabi (even in economy they can do better than that). The girl was slow and sullen serving. On one leg plane was late leaving Abu Dhabi so missed out on pampering in the lounge on the ground. In New York lounge was full no seats no service awful food.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Perth to Athens return in economy and we were pleased with the service of ground staff at both ends who assisted us with access to the lounges at the airports. In the plane the seating was fine and so was the entertainment. We were seated around row 30 in both directions and at meal times choices of meals had run out by this stage. The onboard staff were polite though very abrupt with their mannerisms. The flight was smooth and punctuality was great. As a Velocity member I will continue to fly with Etihad into Europe as I was pleased with the whole experience. There was a discounted offer to purchase a Business Class seat however at the end of our holiday 900 Euro each on top of what we had already paid was a lot. As a Platinum member perhaps a further discount may have enticed us. Economy seats could have had a footrest built in to help with the long flight. IFE sound was poor - I could not reduce the volume and there was a lot of background noise. It is also important to keep us hydrated irrespective of which seat you are in this did not happen unless one asked.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Terrible for economy passengers! I flew business class with Etihad in 2012 - business class was bearable but when I flew in economy in Oct / Nov 2014 it was the worst airline I have ever flown with. The cabin staff attitude towards economy passengers is poor. My husband and I pressed the button once to ask for a drink and the stewardess looked inconvenienced by us. We paid $5000 AUD for the two of us to fly to Dublin and back and it will be the last cent Etihad ever get off us. The inflight entertainment that they brag about hadn't been updated so the movies / tv shows / documentaries that the magazine promoted didn't match what was actually offered - instead we had to watch old movies old tv series and the "latest releases" in the movie section were at least 12 months old. The seats are uncomfortable.

Manchester-Abu Dhabi-Islamabad return. A great experience. I am a single father and was travelling with two little children. All four sectors were fully booked. My children were given kids goody bags on all four flights. All flights were on time. Transit in Abu Dhabi on both occasions was very smooth. Our flight attendant on MAN-AUH (25/10/2014 morning flight) deserves a medal for an excellent customer service. Similarly on AUH-MAN route(02/11/2014 early morning flight) staff were very professional and helpful. Our overall experience was awesome. We have already booked our next flights for February half term.

The flight was fantastic left on time arrived on time all connections were very smooth. A very good service and certainly gives the people in WA another option. One negative was in board entertainment was out dated with very old movies to watch. I would recommend Etihad and will be using them on my next trip.

### Etihad Airways customer review
BKK to AUH to MEL. BKK to AUH in J. AUH to Melbourne in F. First sector was ok as usual Etihad flight was delayed arrival in AUH ok very unfriendly airport and immigration staff. AUH to MEL driver to pick me up at 19.00 but turned up at 18.00. Check in F 4 people sitting or sleeping there a bad business card for the Airline. F-Lounge closed due to renovation. Very unfriendly staff at the Airport including immigration officers. Boarding fine and again 75 minute delay in departure. This airline is no good if you do business as most flights are delayed. F Class service is very mechanical nothing you would write home about. The food was acceptable. The seat is extremely hard. Conclusion Etihad is an airline who invested money in other airlines but has not after so many years brought there on house in order. I missed a number of connections (with no assistance) in the past nothing to write home about and very little features and benefits. The Airport is a mess the staff are extremely unfriendly.

Flew MAN-AUH-KUL then MEL-AUH-AUH-MAN. First flight delayed 4 hours missed our connection to KUL we was put on a flight later that night this wasn't any good to us as we had booked another airline to fly us to SYD and would have missed that flight. We was put on a coach to Dubai and had to fly MH DXB-KUL really good service on MH. We made our connection with 13 min to spare. Service was very slow and if you pressed your call button it was just ignored food wasn't that good only good part was AUH-MAN. The staff on this flight were really good. Not many new films on E-BOX I normally fly Emirates and will be sticking to them. All in all very bad experience.

AUH-DUS EY 23 Oct 26. Better than Air Berlin on the outbound flight. Better seat pitch better entertainment better food. Love the fact that they give you a snack bag soon after departure at 2.15 am and a full breakfast short before landing. AB does it the other way round but who want's a full meal late at night? Flight attendants EY friendlier too so I suggest AB learns from partner EY. Just didn't understand why online check-in is not possible for this route. It's 2014 EY!

We flew economy from Sydney to Dublin via Abu Dhabi and then from Paris to Sydney via Abu Dhabi in October. The in-flight entertainment is great personal screens and a wide variety of entertainment choices. The seating is incredibly tight and uncomfortable. I had to sit on my travel pillow to alleviate the discomfort. Regarding food service my daughter had ordered the gluten free meal but on both long haul flights there was nothing for her first meal. Something was scrounged up by the second meal but that is a long time (over 10 hours) without any food and no one seemed concerned. It is hard to get any assistance from the flight attendants but that is understandable as there are only a few of them and a LOT of passengers to deal with. We managed an upgrade to business class on the shorter flight from Paris to Abu Dhabi and I must say here is where Etihad shines. The attendants were attentive and helpful. Once again there was no gluten free meal available however something was put together straight away. The seats are wonderful (with inbuilt massager) and a real sense of space is created. This flight was a thoroughly enjoyable one. Unfortunately business class is not within our budget.

Flew economy Berlin-Munich-Abu Dhabi-Bangkok. Considering the low price everything was very good. Legroom ok meals acceptable flights on time entertainment very good.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Flew MEL-AUH-MAN-AUH-SYD on EY461 and EY450 respectively earlier this month. Overall the Etihad experience was just OK. We found the 3-4-3 seat configuration on the 777-300ER to be cramped and not particularly comfortable especially if the person in front put his or her seat back. The AUH to SYD leg was on a A340 which didn't feel as cramped (2-4-2) although I found the seat to be harder. Meals were average and of standard fayre but my wife found all of her pre-ordered vegetarian options to be very poor. The IFE was acceptable. Cabin staff were OK but nothing special. Abu Dhabi airport was transited with ease although we remained within Terminal 3 throughout. Flight delays were minor. If price was the sole determining factor I would recommend Etihad however on this overall experience I know there are much better options to be had elsewhere.

Took 4 flights with Etihad in October Perth to Abu Dhabi Abu Dhabi to Rome Paris to Abu Dhabi and Abu Dhabi to Perth. My wife and I were on our honeymoon and these flights were such a disappointing way to begin and end our honeymoon. Check-in at Perth airport was fine and easy but I think that was simply because we were the first in the queue. There was no control around boarding in Abu Dhabi or Paris it was simply get in line and walk on the plane most airlines will board based on rows so that there is not a hold up inside the plane but Etihad don't seem to grasp this concept. Our flight from Paris was delayed in departure by over 1 hour because the plane was late yet we were not informed of this until 30min after we were supposed to board. The food on all 4 of our flights was almost inedible on our Paris to Abu Dhabi flight the chicken that was served to me was cold and we actually had to ask for our meals as the staff bypassed us completely when we complained we were told they thought we had already been served. When we got to the gate in Abu Dhabi on our return flight we were told that we either had to leave our duty free purchases from Paris behind or have them added to our checked baggage because it was an Australian Government regulation when we argued with Etihad staff and showed proof of what the government regulation actually is they denied it and said we either had to leave it behind or check it in. Luckily our duty free purchases made it onto the plane as checked baggage but we were not impressed. 3 of the planes we flew on were A330 the toilets on these planes were certainly smaller than usual on an A330 and I have flown on quite a few. The Boeing 777 we flew on kept having the overhead storage compartments open during flight so obviously the plane required maintenance which had not been undertaken. The only good thing about this airline was the on-board entertainment selection. Everything else stunk I will never fly this airline again and would never recommend it to anybody. In hindsight we should've paid the extra couple of hundred dollars and flown Emirates.

I traveled in September 2014 from Paris to Abu Dhabi and back. Very poor food onboard. Terrible staff service on ground especially at Abu Dhabi airport which is one of the worst airport I have never been. I was highly disappointed by Etihad as I was expected a good service comparable to other airlines of the Arabian Gulf.

Etihad Flight EY460 - Abu Dhabi to Melbourne. Flight was 1 hour late leaving Abu Dhabi - 40 minutes late arriving into Melbourne. Meal service (dinner) was very slow. Cabin staff were even slower collecting trays after the meal service. Many passengers got up and took their finished trays to the galley. Inflight entertainment via personal TV screens was quite good providing an ample selection. Seat comfort was OK (hard) but leg room seemed to be better than other airlines. Breakfast (second meal) was average. Cabin staff were mostly friendly without being effusive.

AUH-DUS EY23 on 26 October. Not clear why we could not check-in online for this route. Got a prompt answer from the service desk though when I asked about it. Not a big deal since check in at Abu Dhabi Airport was a breeze. Overall a much better experience than the outbound flight with partner Air Berlin. Better legroom better entertainment program better headphones and better food. Liked the fact that they didn't serve a full meal at 2.30 am but a snack bag and a full breakfast just before landing (Air Berlin did it they other way round) so you can get as much sleep as possible on this 7 hour flight. Much friendlier staff than AB too. So maybe AB could learn from EY.

Etihad flight EY461 Melbourne to Abu Dhabi 20/09/2014 - Economy. The flight was about 40 minutes late leaving Melbourne although arrival in Abu Dhabi was close to being on time. Meal service was slow. Quality of the meal was average. It took a very long time for cabin staff to collect meal trays after serving the meal. Cabin staff were generally friendly and helpful. Inflight entertainment via in-seat TV screens was quite good offering a reasonable selection. Seats were not particularly comfortable (hard) although leg room seemed to be better than on most airlines.

Etihad flight EY97 from Abu Dhabi to Istanbul - Business Class. Cabin crew were friendly and welcoming. A glass of fruit juice or Champagne was offered on boarding. Meal service (lunch) was efficient and providing a nice choice. Quality of food was very good. Wine offered was also very good. Entertainment was the same offered in economy but personal screens were larger. Seats were very comfortable.

Etihad flight EY514 from Amman to Abu Dhabi 18/10/2014. Flight was late leaving Istanbul. Fruit juice offered on boarding. Meal service was satisfactory but with limited choice. Quality of meal was satisfactory but not exceptional. No wine offered during meal service. I asked if I could have a white wine which was provided but it was not chilled. Cabin staff were obliging but not overly friendly.

### Etihad Airways customer review
It was a pleasant onboard experience with Etihad except for excess baggage charges. To start with the ground staff was inviting cordial and pleasant. I had to carry an excess of 9 KG of baggage for which I had to shell out around £235 which was a shock to me. I tried to suggest that my existing miles could be used to increase the baggage allowance but the systems did not have the capability. The manager provided me with a discount of 1KG which I was not satisfied much with. The meals served were impressive service was fine inflight entertainment largely remains the same across all airlines so not much of a takeaway here. I have read many reviews on leg space being cramped up on the BLR-LHR route but I found it comfortable based on me being 5'11.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Terrible experience with Etihad. Booked 5 business class seats Sydney-Abu Dhabi-Cairo return for family with 3 children. Thought it would make the trip easier as younger 2 kids only 5 and 2. Also Business promised overnight hotel accommodation in Abu Dhabi so we justified the huge expense and thought we'd travel in style! Every leg we were seated separately including putting the 2 year old next to strangers. Just assumed I guess we would have seating together. After first leg refused to change seating for other legs. Refused - told we had to wait until on the aircraft and for attendants to approach other passengers to change. Watched anxiously on every leg as they seated and settled every other passenger before they would try to get my kids near us. Arrived late at night after long flight into Abu Dhabi from Sydney expecting hotel room. Airport almost deserted eventually found long line of weary travellers waiting for single attendant. Waited in line for 2 hours with children and adults close to hysterical by then. Eventually reach end of line and are told no booking made for room for us - then later found. Kids in separate hotel room on another floor! Unable even to have adjacent rooms. Service in plane polite but hardly existent. Bell would expire before attended. Twice sent feedback to Etihad. First not even answered second approach through social media got quick request for details which I provided. Response then was not an apology but "disappointment' at my negative 'impression' of their superior service and well trained staff. They assured me that just because I didn't get my 'preferred seating' (as if I'd just wanted a window seat rather than to be near my children) they win awards for their 'inspired' experience. Would never fly Etihad again!

### Etihad Airways customer review
Flew to Perth - Barcelona return and in July with Etihad booked through Virgin including business class on last leg Abu Dhabi -Perth. But Virgin won't give us any points or status credits blaming Etihad. Very poor code-share arrangement and we will be taking this issue to consumer affairs since it is counter to Virgin's website statements. I have read elsewhere that others have had similar experiences.

BKK-AUH-AMS on 1 Sep 2014 AMS-AUH-BKK on 18 Sep 2014. Passengers will fly Etihad and discover: uninspired cabin service narrow seats rude cabin staff (yes coming from a Dutchman) poor on-time performance an absolute joke of an airline hub have written a separate review on the Airport headings. When you pay extra for exit row seats legroom don't sit in the window seat. It has a horizontal bit of door perfect for stretching out your legs (shoes removed of course) but the stewardess will wake you up by shaking your shoulder forbidding you to do this citing a safety issue with the door. There is a sticker on that door bit saying “Do not sit here” something I was not doing. Meal choice was run down to one choice only every meal. The seats on the B777 were painfully narrow painful for me but particularly for the overweight lady being wedged in the chair next to me. Will I fly this airline again - no thank you. Garuda was a much better experience and at least the Jakarta airport personnel were endearingly inefficient by smiling a lot.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Flew LHR-AUH-LHR EY12 and EY11 during October. Just under an hour check in a slow moving queue at Terminal 4 as the online check in facility was not available. Slightly late departure from London and I found the 777-300ER cabin layout cramped in 3-4-3 configuration the actual seat was reasonably comfortable. Entertainment selection was good with responsive touch screen system and good headphones. The biggest let down for me was the cabin crew they did not really provide any "good" service or smiles the male crew in particular I found quite arrogant and more concerned about how they looked. No water runs offered by the crew throughout the flight you had to go to the galley. Return flight to London over an hour late departing and once again I found the crew lacking completely no tea or coffee was offered to me with the breakfast and when I asked the attendant for one he looked at me like I was being a complete pain. Would try not to use Etihad again unless they were very cheap compared to other airlines.

### Etihad Airways customer review
We flew from Sydney to London Heathrow. First part of the flight was code shared with Virgin Australia. This was a 14 hour flight to Abu Dhabi and was fantastic. Unfortunately that's where it ends. From Abu Dhabi to London was dreadful. The seats were so small that one felt claustrophobic. My husband and I were in the middle and aisle seat. We had a well built young lady sat next to us who also filled in half of my husbands seat. (He sat in the middle). The food was horrible. As it was a night flight we were given a breakfast bag consisting of a bread roll filled with meat an orange popper and a fig filled cake. Breakfast was served about 2 hours before landing and not only looked unappetising but tasted it too. On the return journey back we had the same kind of flight to Abu Dhabi which once again was dreadful. The flight attendants all looked miserable and the service was so slow. The empty meal containers were not cleared away for ages and nobody seemed interested if you rang for service. All in all I would not fly Etihad again. I have flown both Emirates and Cathay Pacific to the UK and will return to them.

I flew LHR-AUH-LHE the flight from LHR to AUH was ok the food was fine and the entertainment was fine too however the flight from AUH to LHE was awful we were made to sit in the plane for two hours while the passengers from connecting flight boarded the plane. There was no choice in meal rice with chicken there were three pieces of chicken in the whole meal and the desert was a small chocolate bar! I fly Emirates usually and made the mistake of taking Etihad not again.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Am a frequent traveller on both Etihad and Emirates and Etihad are way ahead in service friendliness tasty food and making the experience memorable compared to Emirates which has become stale rude poor tasting food and nothing special. Flight from Dusseldorf to Abu Dhabi (Business Class) - A330. Check-in in Dusseldorf was smooth and straight-forward. No Etihad lounge but can use Air Berlin (not very good lounge). Toilets small dirty and shared between a number of airlines. Boarded flight but departure was delayed slightly. Must commend Etihad staff as the flight was superb - excellent food excellent service attentive and friendly. Seat comfortable but prefer the window seat as it offers more privacy than the aisle seat. I have now travelled with Etihad 8-10 times this year and their standard has certainly improved and continues to do so. Well done. The only comment I would say is that the inflight entertainment although was good on this flight it was not very good on the outward and previous flights.

Flew business class Sydney to Abu Dhabi. Couldn't fault the experience. Flew cattle class Abu Dhabi to Sydney and couldn't find anything good to say about the experience apart from the fact we actually made it back. Food appalling service almost as bad. My review is based on the economy class flight.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Flew return Melbourne to London. This was my first Etihad experience and was unsure after reading some reviews but was pleasantly surprised at the efficiency. Only a slight delay on my return flight but I didn't mind because it decreased my stopover in Abu Dhabi. Quick and efficient check-in friendly staff. Having always flown Qantas or SIA I decided to give Etihad ago and would definitely travel with them again. I consider myself a low maintenance passenger so rarely ask the cabin crew for anything but did notice that they were not particularly friendly or helpful to other passengers. I rarely eat on a plane and so can't really comment on the food but it looked like usual plane fayre.

We flew KUL-AUH-ZRH that was operated by Etihad and the service was good. Coming back via ZRH-DUS-AUH-KUL was complete hell because we had to use Air Berlin and Jet Airways. Paying full-frill fare with 1/3 journey by full- frill airline and 2/3 journey using budget airlines means Etihad has brought air travel to a new level of mockery.

### Etihad Airways customer review
SYD-LHR early September 2014 and return early October First Class. What a waste of money. We had travelled twice before with this airline to Europe in Business class and once in First Class but never again. The food service airport lounges and entertainment were very second rate. Their first class boasts that they have an in-flight chef but he does nothing other than heat and supply the food already mentioned in the menu. Nothing special and what meals we did have were almost inedible - although we had particularly requested seafood the only seafood was baked salmon. Years ago lobster tails but no more. The staff were very pleasant. The seats that turned into beds were not as comfortable as we had in Business and the noise from the aircraft was so bad that we ended up trying to sleep with noise cancelling head phones on. One entertainment unit did not work properly and had very little choice for any TV or movies programs. The staff could not fix it. Also the selection left a lot to be desired as it seemed to cater well for children but not adults. When you have a 14 and 9 hour flight you need a good selection. The first class lounges in both Sydney Abu Dhabi and London were all shared with Business and all were every full. We were advised at the time that the First Class lounges were being 'renovated' - and in both London and Abu Dhabi the queue for the ladies was very long. So much for the extra attention and privileges we should have been accorded with the extra money paid for First Class - non-existent. How this airline gets to be the so-called "Worlds Leading Airline" beggars belief.

BNE-SIN in Business was very polished. The crew were attentive and friendly the wine of high quality and generous. The food was very good. A330 cabin was comfortable and the flight went quickly. Departed and arrived on time bags waiting for us and the limousine pick up was an added extra. Flight home was overnight and not nearly as good including the food which was plentiful but bland. Decided not to eat and slept comfortably on the flat bed instead. Overall for my first flights with Etihad I was impressed.

### Etihad Airways customer review
AUH-LHR on B777. I was asked by the cabin crew to change my aisle seat to a middle exit row sea with another pax. Wish I hadn't. The exit row seats while offering leg room are very narrow. The snack pack offered on the early EY11 departure was sufficient just before sleeping. The pre-landing breakfast was OK. It was a shame one isn't able to use the great IFE gate to gate.

EY141 to Toronto - Sept 23 2014. Flight attendant ignored me (seated by window) a few times as they brought snacks and drinks to the two men beside me. I had to speak up and do a hand signal for them to attend to me. The light call for an attendant was ignored for over an hour that I had to flick the switch on and off after that to even get their attention as I was just too parched and finally when they showed up I had to asked for 2 full glasses of water. It was pretty slow service all along. Even retrieval of food trays took ages. The meals were unappealing compared with other airlines I've flown with previously - and 2x they did not give me an choice but just gave me whatever. I do not know why and at this point I could not care - as I feel I have a better choice of airlines in the future.

August 8th 2014 left Brisbane for Manchester. Our first leg of the flight to Singapore was very uncomfortable seats too narrow and hard and when the person in front of me decided to recline well that was it I knew we were in for a very long flight. It was the same again from Singapore to Abu Dhabi the food was not much better attendants were very good. The last leg did improve from Abu Dhabi to Manchester as it was a bigger plane. Will not use them again.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Upgraded from business to first class I wish they had not. I have a problematic lower back - the First Class suite is very private but the seat gave very little lower back support and for me the business class seat is more comfortable. The staff on board were very attentive and helpful the Chef came and saw I was not interested in the meal options so he offered to make me a Teryiaki Chicken which was delicious although the Pumpkin Soup was lacking in both consistency and taste. The cooler wasn't working on the personal mini bar and those two drinks were undrinkable. The entertainment system was good - it had a few nice classics and also a very good selection on new releases . We arrived with a ten minute delay into Abu Dhabi from Paris CDG but my connecting flight into Doha was delayed by an hour because a few passengers checked in their luggage but did not make the flight. Etihad has excellent on board service but airport services baggage handling and crisis management really let their passengers down!

### Etihad Airways customer review
LHR-AUH-BKK-AUH-LHR. I'm realistic about what to expect in Economy I'm a budget student traveller after all but the service was so indifferent on all legs of the journey. All flights were delayed by at least 2 hours luckily they all had a large amount of connecting passengers so the following flights were held for us. Food was terrible I've had a lot better in economy on Qatar and Emirates. Cabin crew were ok nothing more nothing less no one smiled no one cared never really experienced such indifferent service from crew on any airline. Last time I flew Etihad was in 2010 on the same route and they were great they seem to off fallen hard. I'll stick to my trusted Qatar next time.

LHR-AUH-SYD return. Just returned from a trip to Australia. The chauffeur pick up worked well and the lounge at T4 was very good. Staff very attentive. On A340 on both outbound legs and food and wine of good quality. On the way out visited the crowded lounge in Abu Dhabi but managed to have a shower and the staff helped find me a place to sit. Inbound first leg on code share Virgin Australia. Etihad seats far superior as every seat has an aisle access. On the Virgin flight (777) I had a window seat and had to climb over the passenger next to me when he was sleeping. Pleasantly surprised to find the new premium lounge was opened in Abu Dhabi on the return leg. Staff very welcoming and lounge at least 3 times the size of the old one. Food and wine again good on return legs. My only criticism is that the entertainment on offer is nowhere near what it is on Emirates or Qantas.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Flew (August 24) MCT-AUH-GVA. A320 plane supplied for the MCT-AUH flight was tired filthy and should not be in service without a complete cabin redecoration. Seats were stained carpets filthy and the seat pitch was best designed for circus midgets. We were delayed 30 minutes at MCT with absolutely no explanation in English perhaps one was given in Arabic. In AUH I hurried to my next gate for the AUH-GVA leg of the journey I made the plane which pleased me. The A330 was noticeably cleaner although the seat pitch was still better designed for research monkeys than human beings. After being rushed on board we sat for quite a while until someone from the flight deck finally explained that there had been an oil spill on the airport and that we would be sitting another two hours at the gate until the runway was open again. Being a sound and reasonable man I understood why passengers could not be let off the aircraft again. Water and paper "hot towels" were their only attempt at service in 150 minutes? Their first step should have been prompt announcements in both Arabic and English explaining what was happening then informing us that we would be served beverages and that the inflight entertainment system would be turned on. Food served was a joke on this flight - first a snack (late night flight) consisting of awful sandwich rollups with the advice that we would have a "full breakfast" an hour before landing in GVA. The full breakfast was tired and ridiculous - nothing approaching a full breakfast anywhere. Upon arrival at GVA I was one of about a half dozen passengers whose baggage hadn't "made the flight" despite 150 minutes extra time at the gate. It took three days to get my bag to me. Now let's turn to the return trip flown two days ago from ZRH-AUH-MCT. In ZRH we were boarded promptly and the aircraft another A330 was cleaner than the A330 from AUH-GVA. That sort of tells me that you need to better supervise or replace your cleaning staff at AUH your home airport. The flight was not full so there was room to spread out which many passengers did immediately after "boarding completed" was announced. We pushed back with Swiss precision on the dot. Food served was delicious plentiful catered by Swissport/LSG. In AUH I made my way to my departure gate in another Terminal weaving through what have got to be some of the longest walks in any airport anywhere. Luckily here and there were moving sidewalks although these were usually clogged so I was actually worried I would miss my connection in the relatively short transfer time allotted by Etihad of only 70 minutes between flights. I needn't have been worried. After reaching the gate it was again a story of sit sit sit. No explanation. No communication from the airline. Suddenly almost an hour late we were rushed onto the bus to the aircraft. The air conditioning was not on. After 10 minutes of waiting there was a terrific lurch and air conditioning came on. On the (same) plane familiar conditions - filthy tired upholstery dirty carpets ridiculous seat pitch. And again we sat. This time however the captain communicated with us in excellent English. He didn't provide any explanation for the delay but at least gave us accurate estimates of when we would actually take off. And he apologized which surely must have been regarded as unusual by the crew as they seemed shocked when he did so. The only silver lining in this very cloudy tale? This time the delay must have been enough time for my luggage to make the flight.

I travel at least four times a month with my business around the world and I was excited and also nervous after reading the reviews of prior guests in using Ethiad. The route was Perth to Manchester with the normal stop over. Well what I can say is that the below reviews are spot on. The seat is far too narrow I'm 6ft and weigh 84kgs and I struggled in the seat compared to the other major airlines very disappointing. The meals were ok but again I've had better economy food the soup was running down the side the fish was well over done etc however the breakfast into Manchester was good. I will not be using this airline again for the money paid I wish I had stuck to the normal trusted airlines that deliver.

### Etihad Airways customer review
I flew Etihad for the first time this August because I found an incredibly cheap fare. I flew 4 sectors and I was pleasantly surprised and pleased with the overall service standards. The aircraft's were clean and everything worked well. Most importantly the toilets were clean on most sectors. Very disappointing that passengers dirtied and water clogged toilets on the Istanbul - Abu Dhabi sector. The IFE was adequate even though I found it repetitive during the 3 week period. I feel the content should be changed every 15 days. I had ordered special meals AVML and was served on all 4 legs. However I also found that the person in charge of menu planning needs to look at a little change. On all 4 legs I was given Green lentils in the salad. I am sure a little more variety will not cost anymore. On one leg I had a Green lentil salad and a yellow lentil dhal curry so two lentil items in one meal. On the AUH-MEL sector the flight took off 2 hours late. The boarding commenced late and were kept seated in the aircraft for over an hour. Were advised due to congestion. Still a 2 hour delay is unacceptable without a good reason. We arrived at least 1 hour late in Melbourne. If the fare is reasonable I will fly Etihad again.

Took the Jet Airways operated by Etihad Airways flight from JFK on Sept 5th Business Class. Was told that the flight would be just like an Etihad Flight. No such luck. The layout of the seats in Business Class is completely different. Privacy of the seats is less and the middle seats cannot be combined like the normal Etihad cabin layout. Next the menu - All the entrees and appetizers were Indian. The ice cream which they served from the all day dining was quite inferior. No steak or sandwich choices like the flight to the USA a couple of months earlier. No Wifi on the plane as an option either. Choice of videos does not seem to be quite as extensive but not sure on this.

On July 1 2014 travelled with family from JFK to Islamabad Via Abu Dhabi. At JFK there were long lines to check in. Luckily our sky cap was able to get us checked in right away. We had checked in online night before but it did not matter. Flight was full. Food was mediocre. However during the flight cabin crew were pretty good in service. This airline needs to improve quality of food if it is to compete with Qatar and Emirates.

### Etihad Airways customer review
MEL-AUH GVA-AUH-MEL. Im 6.3 and found the seat right on the cusp of being too small so if you are 6.4 you'll have to bend your legs a little and may find it a little cramped. I travelled with my wife and for the long 14 hour trip we had the middle buddy seats and we really enjoyed it with the divider down of course. The shorter flight I had a window seat and found it to have slightly more leg room than the middle seats. I'm around the 90kg medium build mark. All the seats were comfortable. The pillows were proper pillows and the blankets very comfortable. Amenity pack also provided. Throughout the entire journey all staff were friendly and helpful whether it be at check in aircraft or the lounge. I do believe Etihad are in the process of having dedicated lounges which will also add to the whole experience. The Melbourne lounge is shared with several other airlines and not the greatest but its quiet and offers the basics. Abu Dhabi lounge is to small but for an hour stop over was adequate and had a large variety of food and drink on offer. Meals were very good and having the anytime menu is also a plus. Inflight entertainment was excellent. I would have liked noise cancelling headphones as is offered with some other airlines in business class but they were nevertheless comfortable. Aircraft were in excellent condition and pretty close to brand new. So overall a very good experience and wouldn't have a problem booking with them again.

Kathmandu-Abu Dhabi-Manchester. Excellent flight with very good attendants and range of food. IFE could be better difficult to use and limited music choice. The lounge at Abu Dhabi was pretty full when we arrived in the evening as this was peak 'hub' time for Etihad and we had a long layover between connecting flights so not as quiet as anticipated.

Tokyo - Abu Dhabi and back on A330 in business for 2 adults and 2 children (46 years). Both flights on time. Flight from Tokyo with (much) better food than from Abu Dhabi (requested child meal was not available from Abu Dhabi also normal/Japanese food was much tastier delicious orange juice from Tokyo). Service hit and miss on one side of plane nice on another not so much. Flying nanny was very good with entertaining my children. Seats nice but too narrow especially on seats "outside" when you get bumped frequently. No much new movies in entertainment system. Overall nice flights but inconsistent.

Flight from Brisbane to Dublin via Melbourne Abu Dhabi Return CDG Abu Dhabi Singapore Brisbane. I have been a loyal Gold Member supporter of Etihad for many years and written many positive reviews so I guess it was only a matter of time before a negative one would take place! Traveled with Etihad Gold Guest Brisbane - Melb code shared with Virgin Australia. Check in easy at Brisbane lounge quite good (maybe 5.5 out of 10) and no glaringly obvious issues. Melbourne - Abu Dhabi upgraded to business class. (8 out of 10) good service. However business class beds really not as big or comfortable as represented in advertising (I am 6ft1). Abu Dhabi to Dublin - average - 6 out of 10. Arrived Dublin and luggage not there. Farcical is a polite way of describing what happened next. Assured it would be on next flight ex Abu Dhabi. All problems were blamed on Aer Lingus. Went to service desk at Dublin airport prior to leaving. Left Dublin for France a week later with still no luggage. Two weeks later return flight to Brisbane. Check in at (CDG Paris). Business / Gold member lounge excellent (10 out of 10). Flight CDG to Abu Dhabi (freezing cold) IFE Good meal service amateur at the most and they ran out of meals. (2 out of 10). Abu Dhabi airport on return trip a total complete and utter shambles. Completely out grown what it was designed for. Flight one hour late and using the same excuse that has been used for my past 7 flights. Arrive Singapore - excellent - good staff who want to do their jobs. In round and out quickly and professionally. Flight Singapore - Brisbane (4 out of 10). Staff appeared disinterested not enough drink runs (water) staff very busy chatting amongst themselves at the back of plane. Time for Etihad to really pull their finger out and improve to regain the quality airline they once were.

### Etihad Airways customer review
SIN to BNE in October 2013. Check-in was pretty uneventful. As for the flight itself I did not expect to have my economy seat to feel so cramped. Maybe because of the dark brown color scheme that it felt so cramped. Also that distinct Middle Eastern aircraft smell made my allergies act up throughout the flight. I wasn't able to enjoy the inflight entertainment because of my allergic condition. The meals were ok but nothing spectacular. Overall pretty much an average airline for economy class despite all the hoopla and press releases about it.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Travelled for the first time on Etihad flying from LHR via ABU to Colombo Sri Lanka. Check-in at Heathrow was excellent. Had 8 hours layover in Abu Dhabi. Got upgraded on the Abu Dhabi - Colombo leg. Service onboard was OK nothing to complain. Staff were polite. Even Business class staff were just OK. Coming back got upgraded again on the Colombo-Abu Dhabi leg excellent Cabin staff. Very nice and polite staff and very attentive. Abu Dhabi - LHR flight was delayed by 1 hour. Not much explanation from the Captain. Staff were not so polite service average on this flight. They left the menu card when passengers were sleeping and when passengers asked (including us) what was for Breakfast they said look in the menu and all of us were looking for this menu. One passenger found it and handed it over to about 5 others. I thought this was very rude wouldn't hurt them to say what was for breakfast since there were only two options. Overall flight was cheap and good - will recommend and travel again.

Okay service onboard with an ok selection of entertainment. Although the IFE starts well after taking off and gets taken away almost an hour before landing! Food was mediocre at best and very bland. There also seems to be a problem at Abu Dhabi airport (which is Etihad's home base) with luggage handling. Items get lost a lot ours included although we were one of the lucky ones whose bag was located and returned even if on the return journey. Customer service is shocking. Will never fly them again given the choice. Flight was also delayed for almost an hour leaving Abu Dhabi without explanation.

Recently flew business class from NY to Abu Dhabi For the amount of money I paid I would expect staff to treat passengers with respect they were very inattentive and frankly even rude to the business class customers. I fly to the Middle East on a regular basis and I have never experienced such inhospitable staff. The cabin temperature was far too cold and everyone was wrapped up in blankets. My food service was poor and the flight attendant kept bringing me the wrong order. When politely asked to change the temperature of the cabin or bring me the correct order the flight attendants gave inadequate responses. My inflight entertainment experience was also poor since they brought me damaged headphones and when I asked for a replacement they gave me cheap economy class headphones. Overall the ground staff and the onboard service was rude.

LHR-AUH-SYD return in Pearl Business. First impressions mixed. I was trying to secure a single window seat throughout the journey but I kept receiving error messages on their website. I had to call their call centre multiple times to get this sorted. Chauffeur service in London was great. Check-in was smooth and staff provide you with Express cards for security and immigration. I saw that I was assigned a new seat and when I questioned this I was informed that there was an aircraft change but that I still had a window seat. Our planned B77W was substituted for with the A346 (F1 livery) in old Business Class configuration. The inbound flight from AUH was delayed over an hour but the Etihad Lounge at T4 was excellent with great food and very friendly staff. Upon boarding a steward approached me and asked if I would like to change my seat with a mother and her kid since I had a bulkhead seat (11A). I asked where the new seat would be and was told it would be a middle seat. I politely declined but he kept insisting. Following a lengthy argument he finally decided to leave me alone but whenever I encountered him later on in the flight he gave me nasty looks. The old Business Class seat was ok not too comfortable and quite narrow (and probably not suitable at all for tall passengers). Once in the air service commenced and I was fortunate to have a lovely English lady serving my row who provided excellent service. Food was excellent and offered in generous quantities. Abu Dhabi airport is absolute mayhem. The walk from the gate to security was too long and it wasn't quite clear while standing in the security line that premium passengers enjoyed a separate lane. Once cleared I asked a member of Etihad staff for the whereabouts of the smoking lounge and she sent me on a goose chase to a closed lounge which was 10 minutes walking distance. When I came back I informed her that the lounge no longer existed and then proceeded to the Business Class lounge (which ironically had it's own smoking lounge). The lounge was excellent and there were tons of food options available but really very limited seating. The flight to Sydney was on a B77W with the new Business Class configuration which was a marked improvement. Seat was bigger and wider and quite comfortable but you can't help but regularly bump your legs into the tray which is a design fault. Once again flight was late to depart but service was top notch and all meals of outstanding quality. On the return flight I had the pleasure of experiencing the Etihad Lounge in Sydney one of the best I have ever been to with superb staff and a la carte dining. Flights to AUH and LHR both departed and arrived late. Overall Etihad is a great airline. They have some things to iron out (buggy website all my flights were delayed lounge in Abu Dhabi etc.) but I would definitely fly them again.

Shocking. Delayed departure flight missed connecting flight as a result and technical problems on return flight causing hot cabin for almost an hour on tarmac in Abu Dhabi with no air-conditioning. Bad entertainment. I have never heard a pilot apologise as many times before for inconveniences - at least 15 times. Baggage lost as well.

### Etihad Airways customer review
We recently flew business class Brisbane-Singapore-Abu Dhabi-Brussels and return Paris-Abu Dhabi-Singapore- Brisbane. I am a coeliac so ordered gluten free meals. The standard of the meals can only be described as very poor and inedible in some cases. My husband's meals were also very ordinary. We have both had far better meals in economy on other carriers! The service from the flight attendants was also very mediocre with requests for tea/coffee going unanswered. There was little recognition of business class with priority boarding etc. When you pay extra I think it is reasonable to assume you would expect extra. We were bussed for what seemed miles in 40 plus degree heat to our plane in Abu Dhabi and were late leaving with no explanation. This resulted in us being late for the remainder of the journey. Two pluses I can mention are the bed configuration and the new lounge at Charles de Gaulle Airport.

EY 170 LAX-AUH 5 Aug 2014 and EY 274 AUH-HYD 7-Aug 2014. We recently flew from LAX to HYD and back with a stop-over in Abu Dhabi. Our nightmare started from LAX EY 170 was delayed over 2 hrs and we missed the EY 274 AUH-HYD. Monitors on EY 170 gave incorrect information that EY 274 was also delayed by about 2 hrs. Upon arrival at AUH we were told by Etihad staff that EY 274 had departed and we had to stay overnight to catch the next flight in 12 hrs. Waited in line for over 90 mins. to get processed to the hotel etc. When angry passengers asked about this the ground staff said the on-board monitor information was incorrect - no apologies offered. Repeat of above on the return flight EY 275 HYD-AUH on August 18 again delayed take-off at HYD and missed connection at AUH. This time we literally ran to the LAX EY 171 gate as the AUH airport monitors showed EY 171 "boarding soon" but about half-way to the gate were told by an Agent that EY 171 had taken off. Again stayed overnight to take EY 171 the next day (August 19). Economy class seats hard uncomfortable and "sliding seats" not recliners flight attendants unfriendly drinks first offered about 14 hrs. into the AUH-HYD flight! Meals sub-standard/small portions. Overall terrible experience with Etihad which started LAX-AUH service in June poor on-time performance disorganized ground staff poor in-flight service and callous attitude.

Our saga started on Aug 18th from Cochin Airport. Abu Dhabi bound flight (EY281) was scheduled to depart at 4.25am. The Boarding Pass said Gate 2 but the electronic display in the airport was showing Gate 6. ETD remained 4.25am until around 4.15am and that's when the announcement came: EY 281 was delayed until 6am because the inbound flight was delayed. As we waited the next announcement came at around 5.30 with a new ETD which is 6.30am. We approached the Etihad desk and they promised the connection flights would wait for us. Our EY 281 flight finally took off around 7.07am and touched down at Abu Dhabi airport at 9.47am. The (cold and stale) breakfast was served 2 hours after departure. When we landed in Abu Dhabi connection flights to various destinations had already gone. There were agents at the airport who directed us to the Transfer Desk. An Etihad agent approached the NY bound passengers and told us there was a flight leaving to NY in 2 hours and there were seats available. 20-25 passengers whizzed out to the gate the agent directed but when we got there the gate was already closed. We turned around frustrated and came back to the Transfer Desk. Cries from 20-25 passengers were ignored. We had to wait another 2 plus hours before we could talk to the ticket agent. He found seats for us on a flight 14 hours later but to our surprise they could not provide us with accommodation. After about 20 minutes of pleading they agreed to give us rooms outside the airport so we were transferred to a limo waiting area. We waited there for about 40 minutes and got transferred to a hotel. Eventually the 2.10am flight took off at 3.40am. They started to serve the meal about an hour later but to my dismay turbulence started and the pilot ordered the cabin crew to return to their seats. It took another 30-40 minutes before they resumed the food service. We finally landed the 8.55am flight in NY at 9.07am. I waited for about an hour but there was no sign of my luggage.

Sydney to Abu Dhabi - August 14th Flight 455. Abu Dhabi - Istanbul - August 15th Flight 97. We paid $8000 for a business class trip to Europe from Australia. 2nd leg on the way over we were downgraded to economy with no warning no explanation (until we complained) and a totally inadequate $200 "bribe" to shut us up. Add to this a 1 hour delay taking off several staff not caring at all of our inconvenience a broken AV system in my economy seat and I am sure you can guess that I would never recommend this airline ever again.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Aug 14-17 BAH-AUH-CMN / CMN-AUH-BAH. Etihad markets itself as a 'leading' airline of the world. I must say they fall well short of such grandiose marketing. Cabin crew are cold unhelpful and frankly have an attitude in dealing with pax. Abu Dhabi airport ground staff are totally overwhelmed and unable to effectively manage the transit pax arriving at AUH everyday. One need only look as far as Etihad's abysmal on-time performance statistics for testament to how poorly the logistics are run. Aircraft are generally outfitted well although IFE is second rate but this does not go very far for pax experience when complemented by the horrible service on board.

I flew Etihad Airways flight 601 from Johannesburg to Abu Dhabi on 30 July 2014. The cabin crew on this flight was exceptional. They turned up the cabin temperature when asked and they were very friendly. The seats were the most comfortable I've sat in in economy class however this plane dud not have power points as expected. Departure was more than an hour later than expected. The connecting from Abu Dhabi to Rome was on flight 83: departure was late and complimentary grooming kits were not provided. It was on this flight that I realized that Etihad does not pay any attention to detail. The return leg of our trip was on flight 84 from Rome to Abu Dhabi on 9 August 2014. Departure was more than an hour late. The cabin crew was as cold as the cabin pressure which was freezing despite numerous requests from "guests" to turn up the temperature. This is unforgivable. I have never been so cold on a flight. We connected in Abu Dhabi to Johannesburg on flight 602. This flight had power points but was also more than an hour late. 45 minutes due to the airline and 30 minutes due to a customer. The cabin crew on this flight were helpful and efficient.

EY 100 JFK-AUH 9 Aug 2014 and EY 274 AUH-HYD 10-Aug 2014. We recently flew from JFK to HYD with a stop over in Abu Dhabi. Our nightmare started on the last leg (Abu Dhabi to HYD). There is no AC at the gate. There is no information given to the waiting passengers. Flight is delayed by 1 hr. Again no info. To our surprise there is no AC onboard while sat on the runway. Again no info. When angry passengers asked about this the flight attendant mentioned some problems with AC and that it would work after take off. Flight attendants often skipped passengers when serving food and beverages.

### Etihad Airways customer review
What a disappointment. I flew London to Abu Dhabi and onto Melbourne August 11/12th. Both flights were delayed although connection was made the flight out of Abu Dhabi was an hour late with no explanation. I chose my seat online 54K as recommended however all seats are hard and very narrow and watching the screen was not a comfortable experience. Surprisingly with so much content to view the movies on offer were woeful. Meals were below average and partly frozen! Worst of all was the indifference by the flight attendants to the blind gentleman sitting next to me. I had to call them to assist otherwise they would have done nothing. I had to open his meals cut it up and put fork in his hand and in effect do their work.

### Etihad Airways customer review
A friend and I booked two tickets to Seychelles in Economy London Heathrow - Mahe via Abu Dhabi then we decided to upgrade to Business Class via the upgrade offer. Our experience at Heathrow Terminal 4 Etihad Business Lounge was amazing great people smiling great food and great service. On our journey back home we did the same upgrade in Business Class. It was fine from Mahe to Abu Dhabi but our stopover in Abu Dhabi was 8 Hours. We were not afraid as based on our experience in Heathrow we thought it would be just great. What a disappointment! At 2am in the morning on 5th August we came to the reception of Etihad Business lounge and we were declined access for the simple reason that our tickets were upgraded from economy. Furthermore the Staff at desk were both arrogant and unhelpful. So we had to wait in this ugly airport with all coffee shops closed until 6am to have a coffee. I complained to customer service and just received a polite answer but no compensation. I will never fly again with this airline.

I had a flight from Rome (Italy) to Abu Dhabi - Perth - Sydney. All flights were delayed and on the last connection (Perth - Sydney) once landed in Perth with 1.5 hours delay Etihad had cancelled me from the list of passengers catching the next flight to Sydney they booked me on one leaving 9 hrs later. I was at the check in of Virgin Blue and I have been answered "Sorry Etihad decided to move you on the next flight" and we cannot do anything about it. So my flight instead of being 26hrs long it was 35hrs!

### Etihad Airways customer review
Most of my travel is for holidays and two of my last two trips were on Etihad. The first was to South Africa on Etihad and South African the latest was on Etihad and Alitalia - both disastrous. We travelled from Doha through Abu Dhabi to Rome and onto Venice waiting for our Cruise in the Mediterranean now Alitalia ground staff have been on strike. Etihad knew of this strike but still checked my bags through to Venice knowing my bags could have not made it through. It has been three days without our bags and they can't even locate them and I will have to go on a 12 day cruise without luggage other than that I will have to fly with them to go back home.

### Etihad Airways customer review
We flew today from Doha to Venice on Etihad via Abu Dhabi and Rome the flight from Rome to Venice was on Alitalia code share the service on Etihad was very good but again they failed to warn us that baggage handling in Rome were on strike and we ended up arriving in Venice and getting ready to go on a cruise short of three bags why they keep failing to warn their passengers with equipment issues and service problems is just horrible I think I need to take my business elsewhere from now onwards! Please do not take my criticism wrongly Etihad's service on board is one of the best in the business but the end result is what lasts and when you end up in a hotel room getting ready to get on a long awaited cruise holiday without your clothes you begin to ask yourself why on earth did I fly with these people and why did they not re-route me when they knew about the problem but still took the risk with my holiday!

### Etihad Airways customer review
I've flown with Etihad for more than 20 times in the past 3 years mostly from CAI to AUH. Pros: The planes are new and in good shape. Fabulous IFE so you're entertained which is a crucial factor for me. Cons: Seats are too cramped. More importantly on most occasions staff are unfriendly. Every time I travel I say I'll give them another chance but same old unfriendly staff attitude. You feel you need to beg them to do their job! Despite the above I'm still using Etihad as sadly my other alternative would be Egyptair who don't have an IFE on AUH flights so I'm stuck with Etihad.

### Etihad Airways customer review
We upgraded to Business Class from Manchester to Abu Dhabi and were underwhelmed. Both flights were late (although not significantly) with no explanation. The seats are quite comfortable although a bit narrow and clearly it is better than flying economy. But the service was very below par. On the first leg the crew were pleasant and attentive but got several things wrong (eg bringing the wrong meals). On the second leg though (a long one) the crew were awful. In my view we didn't even get economy class service. Nobody introduced him or herself they staff were off-hand to the point of rudeness the meals took forever to come and the staff didn't respond to any minor requests. For example I wanted a little sugar to sprinkle on my breakfast cereal-I was told that only sugar lumps were available and it wasn't until I suggested that I could go myself and collect some from economy that some appeared! This is just one example of the inadequate and even offensive service. My main course at dinner was almost stone cold and because I had waited so long for it I didn't send it back but it was really horrible. This has never happened to me in scores of long-haul economy flights. Also our trays did not have the correct cutlery on them so we had to keep asking for appropriate utensils. Again this doesn't happen in economy! Another issue was that when one pushed the button for service nothing happened. On two occasions we waited for over ten minutes and nobody appeared. Altogether - very poor we would never fly Etihad again. I have no idea where they get the good ratings that they boast about. The only good thing about the airline is that the call centre staff are very pleasant and helpful.

AUH-BKK. Morning flight. Smooth check in at AUH airport. Security check as always long queues since AUH airport has not been able to catch up with the growth in pass anger numbers. Boarding chaotic and unorganized. Flight departed an hour late due to heavy traffic. Seat the usual hard and narrow affair. The very busy FA's tried their best but they were clearly understaffed on this full flight something I've noticed on another flight a month ago. What really upset me was the "breakfast" they served. I opted for the Asian option beef congee. It was about 100 ml of rice soup with a drop of Soya sauce and a few pieces of ginger. Beef could not be found. This was the most disgraceful meal I ever had on a flight and I fly a lot. Etihad claims to be the world leading airlines but I wonder who voted for them certainly not y class passenger.

AUH-DUB return J class. Limo pick up on time and friendly check in a breeze the one negative thing I find with this review is AUH airport and this is not Etihad's fault. The place was manic lounge is not up to the mark place packed looks shabby too small. Queue for the flight no Biz class lane had to fight to get to the front all biz passengers totally confused whilst Y class Pax gave dirty looks as we were finally let through to board first. On board all great staff food wines seat and on time. Return lounge in Dublin is fantastic very comfortable fine dining staff professional. Again return staff great food and beverage super etc. Arrival fast track and into limo in 20 minutes. good job just sort out AUH airport.

### Etihad Airways customer review
To be perfectly honest two of the four flights by Etihad were ok. However the other two were so bad that they are hard to forget. The cabin crew on these two trips were mostly indifferent and disorganised. The seats were hard narrow and uncomfortable and with two tired children crying as well due to the huge delays it all added up! We had a bassinet seat and were told on the phone that we could use a bassinet but when we got there they said the baby was too big. The baby never got fed on any of the trips without asking and literally begging. After one hour and 40 minutes after adult meals were served and asking six times we were given tinned baby food! Buzzers elicited no response. After a huge unexplained delay with no food or water for the children we were allowed on the plane. The food situation was disorganised and haphazard-the food was awful. The missed connections were covered but there was more waits for hotels and transport etc. After all the fuss we got about 2 hours sleep before our connecting flight the next day. The two trips that were better were shorter (6.5 hours) and had less people on them. On both these trips we got help from an excellent nanny and some good service from that person. On one of these trips we got champagne but this was after my finger got jammed in the TV. Food was bad on all trips-seats were poor and the baby not catered for at all.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Disorganised ground staff and process particularly at Abu Dhabi. Late departures poor lounges/terminals/gates at Heathrow and Abu Dhabi. Chaotic boarding. I had not flown with Etihad before. Won't fly again. Qantas a much better flying experience. Food service outside of meals on 7 hour flight was poor - I had to ask three times for a cup of tea. Staff polite but uninterested. Disappointed.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Flew SYD-AUH-GRU-AUH-SYD. My SYD-AUH flight was operated by Virgin Australia and was an excellent experience that I will not comment on here. The other three flights were operated by Etihad which were fine enough. AUH-GRU and return was on an A340 - the planes felt a little old but there was plenty of space compared to most economy seats I've been in. However AUH-SYD was on a B777 with quite possibly the worst economy long-haul seat I've experienced. The plane was nice and new and the IFE was excellent but the 3-4-3 layout meant the seat width was very narrow and uncomfortable even for a skinny guy like myself. It was hard to walk up and down the aisles to get to the bathrooms due to lack of space - kept bumping into people and I'm glad I wasn't sitting in an aisle seat otherwise I would have been extremely annoyed by this. Virgin Australia use a 3-3-3 layout on the exact same plane and it was very comfortable. Etihad need to learn something from their partner.

I flew back from Bangkok to Manchester via Abu Dhabi on 16th/17th July. Firstly my outgoing journey to BKK was pretty good - I have no complaints other than the usual for me not enough leg room (I am 6ft 3) however I am yet to fly with any carrier that I wouldn't say this about. The return journey was okay initially the flight left BKK on time and arrived in Abu Dhabi as scheduled. We boarded the Abu Dhabi - Manchester flight about 30 minutes late and were removed from the aircraft because of a 'maintenance issue' about 20 minutes after embarking. We were then told we could 'show our boarding pass to any of the restaurants in the departure lounge and we'd be able to get some food and a drink. Attempting this proved impossible I was told I needed a voucher from Etihad and wouldn't get anything unless I did. So a 25 minute queue for the voucher. Back to get some food. Oh the voucher only entitles me to what? A doughnut and a coffee! A 6.5 hr delay and this is all that was offered I was pretty disappointed and felt like this was in contradiction to Etihad's excellent reputation. We were eventually boarded on a flight some 7hrs later and whilst on-board the crew and staff were very attentive and professional. They provided a great service however the huge delay put a dampener on my return trip.

Very disappointed. Flew Singapore to Brisbane in July and from the moment we were ushered from the very average lounge to the gate (only to find flight delayed 1.5hours) things went downhill. Seats extremely small for business class. I am an average size western female and found the business class space tight in comparison to other airlines. Champagne served immediately. After discussing our need to make a tight connection in Brisbane with the cabin crew we were assured each time we enquired (3 during flight) that our daughter would be bought through from economy so we could exit quickly that the ground crew had been notified and that there would be ground crew to assist us to make connection. None of this happened! We fly on average twice per month and will not fly Etihad again!

AMS-BKK 17 July 2014 with a stopover in Abu-Dhabi. Packed madhouse on the EY 408. The flight EY408 - Abu Dhabi- BKK was just cancelled and merged with EY 404. The reason was that both aircraft's were half full. Packed accordingly and left 3 hours later. Originally I had carefully selected window seat 52A but had now been put down in the middle on seat 47E. Cabin layout seats was 3-4-3. Seats are so tight. After hours of waiting I discovered my suitcase was not on the plane! My luggage was supplied one day later to my hotel.

AUH-DUS return. The started on a rather bad note as the limousine did not show up. Calling the call center is a waste of time as they are rude and never call back. I took a cab and rushed to the airport. I had to fight for my taxi money but got it back. The flights were uneventful the usual long but very narrow sleeper beds well presented but not very tasty meals and the overworked and understaffed crew in C class. Etihad is an ok carrier but cannot be compared with its South East Asian competitors.

### Etihad Airways customer review
We had 3 flights with Ethiad (Australia - Europe - return) and the staff were miserable - we felt we couldn't even ask for a glass of water outside of the food service. There was no pre-boarding for families with kids which a few years ago for us was invaluable (with SIA of course). Our last flight Abu Dhabi to Perth today was over booked and an employee stood at the gate and announced "boarding now" so it wasn't done in seat order - absolute chaos. A family of 4 with kids under 3 was sat 2 and 2 on opposite sides of the aircraft. Abu Dhabi airport is chaotic and officious (although the Premier Inn for an overnight stay when we had an 8 hr layover outbound was the highlight and very good). The aircraft spent ages taxiing after landing (outbound and inbound) with no communication from the cockpit and likewise our last flight left an hour late with no announcement as to why. The attendant call button is very loud and seems to sound continuously throughout the flight - why can't the volume be turned down or the staff rely on a light? The temperature kept going from hot to cold and back again - very unpleasant. Overall not great and we won't go again - what you see on the advert is definitely not what you get.

We had the most disappointing experience with Etihad. We travelled SFO-LAX-AUH-MAA both ways. On our way to Chennai both the flights were delayed and missed our connection flight to Chennai. We had to stand in the line for the flight transfer desk for 3 hours and stay in an airport hotel for a day. The return trip was 'lovelier'. The flight from Chennai landed in Abu Dhabi on time but was stranded on the runway for an hour and a half. So we missed our connection flight to LA and we are standing in the line at the flight transfer desk for 2 hours and still counting. We would not recommend this airline.

EY 641 8 July 2014 AUH-NBO. EY 642 12 July 2014 NBO-AUH. We expected much more. Both our flights we had inattentive crew malfunctioning and/or broken seat equipment and IFE weird menu options. When trying to view 'our Network' the IFE the screen simply went blank and showed a white fuzzy box. Looking in the magazine or asking crew members did not make matters better. Offering bags of plastic packaged caramel corn before landing also seemed a bit off for an award winning airline. Both of our flights departed and arrived very very late as well. The only positive for them is the quality of economy class headsets and honestly outside of that the experience on their competition especially Emirates is far superior!

BKK-AUH July 10th. An extremely unpleasant experience from the beginning to the end: chaotic check-in at BKK airport flight delayed no explanation or apologies. Equipment was an overcrowded Airbus 340-600 we were packed like sardines and temperature was extremely hot inside the airplane. Staff were rude and unprofessional. No efforts to bring the temperature down no water service I had to ask 3 times for a glass of water. Luggage delivery was also delayed.

### Etihad Airways customer review
I have just completed a 6 week holiday with my wife and had the unfortunate experience of flying Etihad on 4 occasions. The airline promises one thing and delivers another ie: we had a 3hour delay at MEL which meant we missed our connecting flight at Abu Dhabi so had another 2 hour delay which meant we were almost 6 hours late arriving in London. On the return trip we left Dublin nearly 2 hours late which really didn't matter as the flight from Abu Dhabi to MEL was delayed by well over an hour. I found the staff at the airport and onboard rude and not receptive to customers requests. 777-300 - a very cramped uncomfortable and noisy aircraft.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Very disappointed with Etihad planes late on two occasions already and now waiting in a crummy business lounge in Athens with another late plane. They only give one hour's WIFi in what is supposed to be a business class lounge and the place is hot with second rate food and service and in appropriate seating design. Entertainment system was not working in my business class seat on the way over. First world problem I know but you pay a lot for these seats and they knew the seat had issues from previous flights but still put me in it. Just not good enough. Never flying them again.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Highly rated airlines but a totally disappointing experience. Food is really bad and the seats are really tight. Took a return flight from KL to Sao Paulo and for such a long journey the seats were really uncomfortable. Not to mention that the flight was delayed for 3 out of the 4 legs. The change over in Abu Dhabi was a bad experience as well. The change of flight required extensive walking with a 2 hr lay over only and had to go through a long line for x-ray again.

MEL to AUH. Flight was late leaving with no explanation. The seat was very uncomfortable being hard and with no support at all. There were no headphones for the inflight AV so this needed to be requested. The sound quality from the headphones was distorted with high pitched noises making listening to anything unpleasant. The flight attendant took orders for dinner which served after midnight local time. The meal was adequate but nothing unusual or noteworthy. After dinner that was the last I saw of any flight attendant until breakfast was served many hours later. For some reason I was overlooked by the flight attendant and received no breakfast in fact I was not even asked if I wanted coffee or water. This would be unacceptable in economy class and certainly is so in business class. The flight attendant did speak to me when he wanted to sell me tax free goods from the catalogue. I will not be booking Etihad again.

EY20 28th November and EY17 on 3rd Nov 2013. Would definitely fly them again everything was immaculate the crew at LHR/AUH and on the aircraft and the aircraft itself. I was sat in coral economy and had more legroom than any carrier I've been on in that class the IFE system was great brilliant selection of TV Films Music games and more. 3 choices of main meal in economy as well as snack service and obviously drinks. You may pay a little more but the service and the airline itself is definitely worth it.

Had the misfortune of flying Melbourne - Washington DC via AUH last year in December. The planes were old and shabby. On one of the legs I was forced to sit in one of the 'love seats' with a complete stranger. I couldn't sleep as I had to keep moving his leg off my bed yes they really are that close! Complained to the airline via email they chose not to respond.

Flew to Thailand on 15th June returned on 23rd June. Flights EY16 and EY402. Returning EY401 and EY15. I have flown with Etihad many years maybe not again. I am over six foot in height and I think Etihads seats are made for small people. Manchester to Abu Dhabi and then Bangkok I was very uncomfortable all the way. Asked for extra legroom at Manchester and was told it would be £59 extra to Abu Dhabi and then pay extra again at Abu Dhabi to Bangkok. The food was adequate and TV entertainment average. Being an Etihad gold member I have seen Etihads quality go down. Very disappointed.

### Etihad Airways customer review
This is my preferred airline. Why? Because the service is excellent you feel as if you are travelling business class nothing is too much trouble for the staff. Entertainment is the best with excellent earphones. I had to travel Virgin Australia on my way back from Paris to Sydney oh the difference Etihad every time.

### Etihad Airways customer review
LHR-AUH-KUL and back. LHR to AUH on Boeing 777 3x4x3 configuration AUH to KUL on Airbus A330 2x4x2 configuration. Very good value for money quite short connection times but not a problem even though AUH is very busy. Cabin crew immaculately presented and actually looked like they enjoyed their job. Good IFE with great selection of films and it was easy to use. Food and drink was ok although I didn't have the snacks. MY only complaint were the seats they were rock hard and it felt like sitting on a slab of concrete after 6 hours. However that's the only real negative and I would fly with them again.

Flew MAN-AUH-BKK all on B777-300. Outbound no particular problems though the food offered was at best average. Inbound a different story. Food poor entertainment system barely worked had to be reset 3 times but the worst - aircraft boarding. At AUH organised boarding no way no young families first no row selection just 1 mad free for all on an almost full aircraft. Total disgrace for a 4* rated airline more like a cheap budget outfit. Not my first choice to get my custom again!

### Etihad Airways customer review
I upped my Pearl Economy ticket to Pearl Business via Etihad bidding. Flew the first leg of my trip home (BKK- AUH). Airplane was one of the older (two class) 777-300ER of Etihad Airways. Seat area layout was ok especially when travelling alone and having one of the separated seats open to the aisle. I would not want to sit in one of the 'couple seats' with a complete stranger. Seat size was below optimum for a 1.88m/6'3'' person like me as in the maximum reclined position I wasn't able to stretch out completely. Putting one leg in the aisle was not causing a problem due to generous space especially when compared to the extremely narrow economy class aisle in 3-4-3 configured 777s. Power sockets and USB-Plug-in were somewhat randomly put into several areas and the table was too far from the person to enjoy the meal in an upright Position. The layout was clearly lacking storage room for something small like earphone case or iphone. No noise suppressing headphones were provided although announced in the ad (Website). I used my own ones and was able to sleep rather comfortably for most of the six hour flight. Food was ok but nothing much to write home about relatively small choice (again not really according to the advertised super cuisine). Overall a nice experience made the second leg in the extremely cramped economy class of a (nevertheless brand new) Airbus A330 of Air Berlin even more painful.

### Etihad Airways customer review
I travel to Melbourne from Manchester once or twice a year. This was my first trip with Etihad. The chauffeur was excellent but had not been given the correct information as to where to pick me up. Fortunately he sent a text and I found him and was in plenty of time so no worries. Unlike the other airlines I have flown with I did not feel 'looked after'. I have a gluten free diet and at the first meal the cabin crew apologised not only for there being no g/f bread but also for the very tired looking meal. The standard of food was not what I expected. I loved the configuration of the seats affording excellent privacy but was glad I am neither claustrophobic nor overweight. At Abu Dhabi the walk to the gate from the cramped lounge was very long. I felt quite ill and asked for some water to take some painkillers but was told to walk 'downstairs' to buy some. A member of staff eventually produced a bottle of water. The next leg was a repeat of the first apologies for lack of bread (I do not need bread it would have been simpler just to say nothing) and very poor food. However I slept well and there was wifi on board which for me is a huge bonus although there is a cost to this. This flight fell below my previous experiences on the MAN - MEL route.

### Etihad Airways customer review
I had to fly urgently from my home in Kathmandu to London and only Etihad had the dates and times I wanted. My flight was EY 11 on 26th June AUH-LHR Economy seat number 23D. It was a Boeing 777. After my last two terrible experiences with the seating I had vowed never to use Etihad again but this time I had no choice. The experience was just as terrible with these ten across tiny seats. It's a shame because the cabin service and meals were as usual excellent. I will be travelling by Qatar Airways Oman Air or Air India whenever possible in the future and I will use Etihad as a last resort.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Flew Sydney to Manchester return Business Class. New Business Class seats are very good.. I got the old seat from AUH-SYD and you can definitely see the improvement. Food was good. Other airlines do offer a bigger Menu. Lounge in Terminal 3 AUH very disappointing too small and at Peak times standing room only. Etihad's main competition Emirates offer a better overall product. Etihad are trying to keep up with Emirates. They are trying to grow very quickly but missing some of the simple little things that make a great airline such as Singapore or Emirates.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Flew LHR-AUH-BKK was dreading flight as planes got changed to the 777 at short notice and I had previously seen the reviews of that plane on here. I was really impressed with leg room and seat comfort even though 3-4-3 seating. I don't see what people have been complaining about. I found it more comfortable then Emirates BA and other major airlines. The entertainment was great and the food was excellent. Would recommend Etihad.

### Etihad Airways customer review
I recent flew numerous sectors with Etihad in Business Class. The cabin crew seem to enjoy their job and this shows. The Business Class product is excellent except for the smaller A320 aircraft. Very old and dingy interior. The Flagship Business Class Lounge in Abu Dhabi in the mornings is a complete joke. This lounge is something you'd except from a 1 star airline. I did though have the pleasure to experience the lounge mid-morning and it was very pleasant. Staff even remember my face from previous visits and coffee choice. The Etihad Chauffeur is also fantastic along with the dedicated Business/First check-in. Cannot fault this airline and it will continue to be my airline of choice!

### Etihad Airways customer review
I flew from Abu Dhabi to New York the plane was not an Etihad plane but an Indian Jet Airways plane. The plane was filthy they ran out of water and the toilets were so dirty my colleague were reluctant to use them. A 14 hour flight. Numerous people complained. Etihad code share with so many people now its a gamble what sort of plane and service you are going to get. I used to love Etihad but you no longer get what you pay for.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Flew with MAN-AUH-NRT and back. Flights to and from MAN were on 777-300. These planes are very cramped in 3-4-3 configuration. That said staff were courteous and the food perfectly acceptable. However the perennial problems with delays leaving Manchester reared their ugly head (apparently waiting for passengers from a connecting flight which has arrived some time before the scheduled departure). This resulted in a mad dash transferring through AUH to get my connection to NRT. Flights to and from NRT were on A330 which seemed much more spacious in terms of legroom. As the flight to NRT was half-empty there was plenty of room to stretch out. Arrival at NRT spoilt by the non-arrival of my baggage. Credit where it's due the Etihad representative was straight on the phone to track it down but this has happened to about 12 people on the flight. Even more disturbing the Etihad rep had told me that it happened to 7 people the day before. Service on the flight was perfectly acceptable but the delays and transit issues at AUH and temporary lost baggage spoilt the "Etihad Experience" for me.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Flew coral economy class DEL-AUH-DEL and was very impressed and comfortable. Cabin crew on both legs very professional and also very friendly at the same time. Food quality was very good. This is part of the flight experience. Good food good clarity on the screen for the on demand media and they also have decent noise cancelling headphones. Service was good even though the flight was full.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Flew Athens-Sydney and had pre-allocated seats down the back (A and C) so wife and I would not be hassled by adjacent traveler in overnight flight. At check-in we were changed to BC seat with no explanation nor would they change it. Seat A was occupied and plane only 60% full. After takeoff I moved to vacant aisle seat with no one beside me. Mid flight a stewardess pushed 2 more into the seats next to me. Why as there were other vacant seats? I checked our original seat allocation and found 1 child under 5 occupying both A/C seats with parents in aisle seat with 2 spare seats next to them. That's unbelievable. Terrible flight and can't believe how poor seat allocation is. I will not fly Etihad again.

We flew from Milan to Abu Dhabi and on to Sydney on May 24th and enjoyed the flight very much. The flight departed both Milan and Abu Dhabi on time. The Aircraft's were clean and comfortable. The meals were tasty and the cabin service excellent the flight crew were attentive and prompt in handling any request.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Flew business class Dublin to Abu Dhabi return and was very impressed. The driver collected us on time and the lounge in Dublin is excellent. Cabin crew on both legs very professional and also very friendly at the same time. Food and wine top notch and loved the fact you can eat when you want and what you want. The beds are narrow but comfortable. The only gripe is that the lounge in Abu Dhabi is dreadful. Its overcrowded and too small. To say this is their signature lounge is a joke. Passengers were sitting on the floor as there were not enough seats! This is part of the flight experience but its letting the product down big time.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Flew KWI-AUH and AUH-MNL on 15-16 May 2014 and then MNL-AUH and AUH-KWI on 8 June 2014 . In-flight food service entertainment in all flights and Premium Lounge were quite superb. Staff were accommodating. Special lanes for the Business Class passengers now exists again. I had much better experience now than the last flight I had with Etihad last December 2013 and January 2014.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Flew MEL-AUH-AMS. Seats were cramped. Food was pretty good and so was the entertainment. Flight attendants were ok but they were quite peculiar about giving you more water. Being on planes for more than 15+ hours one gets dehydrated. Clean up after meals were too slow. It took them more than half an hour to come back and collect the rubbish. Transiting through Abu Dhabi was horrible. They make you go through security again and on our flight back to Melbourne we had to go through security twice. Boarding and transiting logistics needs to be looked at it's it not streamlined overlaps and absolutely chaotic. Other than the transiting in Abu Dhabi flight was pleasant.

### Etihad Airways customer review
On our outward trip from Abu Dhabi to Johannesburg I was allocated seat no 22c and my husband was allocated seat no 22a next to me but for reasons unknown ground staff decided to change my husbands seat to 26g. This was done without consulting us. Assuming that the passenger seated next to me must have made a specific request for that seat I was surprised to learn from her that she has made no such request. When I pointed this out to the air hostess she was apologetic though it was not her fault. For a flight of 9 hours my husband and I were made to sit apart. On our return from Johannesburg to Abu Dhabi we a group of 9 adults who are strict vegetarians had to make do with bread and juice and a couple of packets of nuts as our meal request for avml or asian vegetarian meal was not showing in their system. To sum it up our experience with Etihad was bad and the only saving grace was the air hostesses who were very considerate.

### Etihad Airways customer review
The crew that make the difference on a journey. SYD-AUH-LHR in April 2014. The crew from Sydney were far superior to the AUH-LHR crew. Both were competent but the first crew were better. The comfort level is high in Business Class and the starlight effect in the cabin is lovely. The food on varies from good to excellent depending on choice. The wine list is quite nice but I hope next time they will have changed their champagne.

### Etihad Airways customer review
The service on Etihad is possibly the worst. Booked special meals which never arrived on a long haul flight from Johannesburg to Abu Dhabi. The same happen on our flight from Jeddah to Abu Dhabi. The seating on flights to and from South Africa is really poor On our flight 21 April 2014 two emergency exist doors did not operate. Delays experienced on at least 2 hours from Jeddah and Abu Dhabi.

17 hours I was in Abu Dhabi international airport on my way to New York because the flight EY 253 was delay about one hour. It was not only me there were about 20 passengers from different countries also sitting on chair for delay. The airport people only gave us two meal voucher nothing else.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Travelled from KUL to Munich early May and awaiting my return flight at Munich airport. Flight to Munich was delayed by an hour with no explanation or apology by the pilot. On the return flight I asked to be upgraded to business class and was quite happy to pay a surcharge but was shocked that the surcharge was the price of my Return Economy. Seats are cramped and uncomfortable and in flight entertainment is terrible. I will never ever fly Etihad ever again.

### Etihad Airways customer review
I have flown Etihad 4 times in the last 12 months. Each time the service gets poorer. Last time 27th April I was rescheduled Manchester to Heathrow to Bangkok. I was assured there was ample time to transfer from T1 to T3 LHR .Not so had to dash only made it because BKK flight was delayed. I do not need such stress. Now the return leg on 18th May from BKK to AUH. No member of cabin staff identified me as a gold member each request was declined and the stewardess was totally out of her depth. for example when I asked for a glass of dessert wine I was told I would have to wait until business class was finished and see if there was any left. One hour and 25 mins later it arrived. By such time I had lost the will to complain . On the flight from AUH to MAN I was boarding with business class passengers . As I entered the aircraft the cabin crew manager said to the gentleman in front 'lovely to see you again sir through to the right' - to myself "in there to the left" with a look of disdain then to the next two behind lovely to see you etc. As a frequent flier and gold card holder I feel the treatment I received was abysmal.

### Etihad Airways customer review
New York to Abu Dhabi is one of the worst flights I have traveled. Seats are cramped and extremely uncomfortable not much leg room. Cabin was too cold and cabin crew was not helpful. Food was not great. I had a horrible experience and it took 2 days to recover from all the tiredness. Don't try this airline even though they offer a the cheapest price.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Travelling Etihad Airways from Athens-AbuDhabi-Sydney was terrible. More crowded than domestic seating seat allocation changed for no apparent reason and my wife and I stuffed into Seats B/C with A occupied when only 60% full. I moved to another unoccupied E aisle seat with 2 vacant spots beside me and during middle of night for unknown reason flight attendant installed 2 more people next to me. Unbelievable. Checked our original 2 seat allocation and it was occupied by one child under 6 with spare seats next to her parents in middle seats. Unbelievable. Never Etihad Airways again.

### Etihad Airways customer review
I was traveling with my fiance and mother from NZ to Manchester in April 2014. On the SYD to AUH flight I had a live crawling beetle in my salad. I alerted cabin crew who attempted to remove it and return my salad to me! After following up the whole flight she finally said she had submitted an incident report. On the AUH to MAN flight the cabin staff gave our vegetarian meal to the family behind us. They started eating it and then the staff realised they had made a mistake so they removed the meal from the family behind us and gave it straight to us. The staff never returned when we requested water and it usually took 3 or 4 times until we got water. When I laid a complaint to the head office they offered my free guest miles and we stand by our great service and are offering you these guest miles. And that was it.

### Etihad Airways customer review
I am very disappointed by Etihad Airways. They changed my flight timings without even considering my schedule. They have messed up my domestic flight timings with out even considering that it is prepaid already. The only solution Etihad Airways could engage was to persuade me into cutting my trip short or make it longer which I cant .The other solution Etihad encouraged me to partake was giving me a full refund. Its so easy for Etihad Airways to dump a customer off the cliff. Happily they try so hard to take your money when a deal is made but engaging in solution is something you are poor at. I work full time. I am an employee who has to make precise schedule to make that once in a life time trip to see his family in a short notice. Very disappointed!

### Etihad Airways customer review
I have traveled Emirates Qatar Airways Lufthansa British Airways Air India and Etihad Airways so far in the last few years. But the staff service I received from Etihad Airways was so bad that I am writing this immediately after my travel. I was travelling with my 1 year old daughter and was surprised by the attitude of the Air Hostesses and other cabin staff. They were least friendly and least helpful when you ask them anything. I needed some help with my bags to be put in the compartments above the seat and I asked a staff to help me as I had my daughter who was not very happy either. But I was told point blank that she cannot carry my bags. During the flight I asked for some warm milk for my daughter and the staff gave a cup of cold milk (after asking a couple of times). When I asked if they can help me get the milk warmed I was again told clearly that that is all they can do and they can't warm the milk. Then I had to request them a few times to finally get the milk warmed. I am just putting down a couple of things here. But the experience was bad to worse and it all had to do with an unfriendly and unhelpful staff.

### Etihad Airways customer review
My wife and myself went to Colombo airport and got checked in for a flight to Munich via Abu Dhabi. The flight was in the initial beginning was late by one hour. The Etihad ground staff knew about this problem but still issued us both the Boarding Passes Colombo to Abu Dhabi and Abu Dhabi To Munich. On the flight we asked the Purser and the Air Hostess to check with the Pilot about our connecting flight in Abu Dhabi. All three assured us that we will be able to catch the connecting flight. Upon landing at Abu Dhabi airport we were met by a Etihad ground staff who told us that the connecting flight had left for Munich 1.5 hours ago. So all that assurance by the Pilot and the Purser was a lie. We were made to do immigration formalities and brought to the baggage collection carousel. The baggage took exactly one hour and twenty minutes to arrive. We were not offered any water nor a place to sit no one was kind nor helpful at the airport. We were handed over to Etihad Airways staff who was the rudest I have ever known. Just because she is of Arab origin she thought that everybody else are low down. She took us to the taxi rank at the airport and handed us over to a taxi driver who drove us off to Dubai. She also told us that there will a person from Etihad who will take care of us at the Dubai Terminal. Finally we reached Dubai Emirates Business Terminal and got ourselves checked in. What a difference from the Emirates Staff compared to the Etihad staff. Nobody at Etihad Airways cared a damn and they were not bothered.

My wife and I flew Etihad from London-Abu Dhabi-Male on the outward journey of our holiday.

We will see if they manage to redeem themselves.

Manchester to Trivandrum via Ab Dhabi. We were pleasantly surprised and no problem with the flights the service and the transfer through Abu Dhabi. The seats on the shorter flight to Trivandrum were comfier than the 7 hour flight and we didn't enjoy the food very much - but that may be a personal thing! Flight attendants pleasant. No problems on the return journey apart from a queue between terminals at Abu Dhabi - however it moved quickly and we were not inconvenienced. All flights on time.

### Etihad Airways customer review
We had 4 flights with them and all 4 were late one by as much as 11 hours. Not a good start! With regard to the longest delay we were put into a "first class hotel". I do not call Premier Inn first class! We were told that we would have a chauffeur car to get there. After a 30 minute wait we ascertained that the hotel was some 200 metres away so we walked having wasted half an hour. On the return flight to Heathrow we witnessed a blatant disregard to the general safety regulations when a young female continued to occupy a seat next to an emergency door when it was very obvious that she would have been unable to carry out the special duties that pertain to that position. Finally quite a proportion of inflight entertainment units were inoperable.

### Etihad Airways customer review
I flew Etihad on 9 March 2014 from LHE-AUH-IAD. My trip started horribly from LHE where the Pearl and coral lanes were not even separated ground staff had no interest towards assisting anyone. It took them 2 hours to give me my boarding pass and they gave me an aisle seat when I had checked in online with a window seat. The plane was 1 hour late and when I entered the cabin only 1 flight attendant was there to guide everyone to their seats. No welcome drink served not even water. After take off the flight attendant brought me someone else's meal and then repeated the same thing again. It was a short flight and had a longer journey ahead. When I arrived at AUH airport I was happy to see they had extended their terminals and new terminals have been added to the airport. After clearing the security check point I went to the Pearl lounge and was so disappointed that there was nowhere to sit. I went to the new US Immigration's and Customs area which was done very well. The flight was an hour late. 14 hours to DC was ok the flight was full so I couldn't get my seat again. I was very disappointed with their inflight entertainment system as it has nothing at all to watch or listen to. Food quality was ok. Landed at IAD and my limo was not ordered as per the agent at the IAD airport. The bottom line is I have been travelling Qatar Airways for the past 4 years and they are excellent when it comes to taking care of their business class passengers. I hope Etihad improves.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Melbourne to Seychelles via Abu Dhabi and it was a pretty average flight small seat pitch mediocre food only one drink served on a 13 hour flight. The way home however was a different story. On 27th April the plane took off from the Seychelles 5 hours late due to fog in Abu Dhabi. I knew I would miss my connecting but assured that ground staff in Abu Dhabi had it taken care of. When we arrived there was no sense of order or anywhere near enough staff. On arrival at 11.10pm I was told to queue at the flight transfer desk. At this point there were two people working the desk. The queue broke up and it became a free for all. After 3 hours of waiting in this queue I was rebooked on a flight to Sydney and then another one on to Melbourne the following day. I arrived in Sydney to find my luggage was not with me. I had obviously missed my next flight so was rebooked again and found myself back in Melbourne 17 hours later than intended. I finally got my luggage 4 days later.

EY16 Manchester to Abu Dhabi on 14th April. Business class. Arriving Abu Dhabi there was no gangway we had to disembark using metal steps. There was no handrail and I aged 87 I had difficulty using the steps with very little to help me to climb down. At the same time an elderly lady perhaps not as old as myself but using a walking stick also had difficulty going down to ground level. There ought to have been a handrail. Thursday 1st May on my return at Sydney airport I attempted to find the Business class lounge prior to boarding EY455 Sydney to Abu Dhabi. I walked almost the length to Gate 60 before I found that it was near the Duty Free section. I had waked past with a number of people. The signing was poor and needed an overhead indication. On 3rd May EY021 Abu Dhabi to Manchester I asked for grilled beefsteak from the main menu only to be informed that it was not available. The alternative from the Anytime Menu was adequate. At all times the staff were extremely efficient pleasant and helpful.

Abu Dhabi to London on 29th April 2014. We flew a Boeing 777-300ER A6-ETN. The seats were very narrow and made you feel claustrophobic due to the 3-4-3 configuration however the comfort of the seat was good the seats also looked very attractive. The aisles were very narrow and small. The value for money was great the legroom was decent and the staff service was average. My mother asked for headphones 3 times until someone bothered to fulfil her request. She asked for water a several times and a Air Hostess looked annoyed and gave her a whole bottle. Their attitude needs some sorting out. The food and beverages were great and the IFE was very good too!

Lahore to Abu Dhabi on 29th April 2014. We flew an Airbus A340-600 A6-EHH. The plane was scheduled to be an Airbus A330-200. Last minute plans from Etihad was made which annoyed me a bit. The cabin seriously needs refurbishing it looks old and worn out inside. The seat comfort was decent and the legroom was good. The cabin crew were rushed and some were kind and some were moody.

The flight was delayed 1 hour 30 mins due to delayed passengers and a sick passenger. When the flight finally took off we we're allowed to use the IFE and the IFE was pretty good. The cabin crew were all a bit moody and rushed which wasn't very helpful at all. The seat comfort was decent and the legroom was good. I liked the configuration of 2-4-2. The meal was also decent.

London to Abu Dhabi 31st March 2014. We flew on a Boeing 777-300ER A6-ETL And the configuration of the Coral Economy Class seats were 3-4-3 it made you feel very claustrophobic. It was a struggle to get luggage through the tiny little narrow aisles. To be different from flying the regular PIA we chose Etihad as it was cheaper. The cabin crew were all very nice and kind the seat had very good comfort. The legroom was okay the in-flight entertainment was quite good!

### Etihad Airways customer review
FRA to SGN in May 2014. Excellent food at any time during the flight. All meals were served with nice silverware and almost to 1st class standard of other airlines. You can choose any course and combination as much as you like and whenever you like. Excellent in-between-meals and they even reserve you your favourite main dish if you decide to eat later. Toilets are cleaned multiple times. I am 196cm tall and still could sleep on 100% flat beds. Entertainment a bit limited but headphones comfortable. Amenities bag complete with socks ear plugs hand and face moisturiser tooth brush and toothpaste of high quality. Most importantly and above all: the staff including ground staff in the lounges and check-in in FRA and AUH. I have never been in a better lounge then the Etihad lounge in FRA (except may be the Lufthansa HON lounge in FRA but that is a different world of it's now).

Our direct flight to Manchester was overbooked travelling from Abu Dhabi to Manchester. we were unceremoniously rushed on to a flight to Heathrow.

As we are unable to fly again vouchers are worthless.

London to Bangkok via Abu Dhabi on 22nd April returning 30th April. Flying First and Business class - the worst experience I have had on an airline. Delayed 2 hours at Heathrow (no reason given) had to go on a later flight from Abu Dhabi to Bangkok again delayed 2 hours each time we were just sat on the plane waiting. Service on the plane very poor. Although no delays on return service was very poor again. Seemed like air crew had no interest in passengers only their own comfort. Staff in airport lounges disinterested with very rude tone.

### Etihad Airways customer review
I flew First Class from LHR-AUH-SIN-BNE and back again. I must say the service was excellent. Our steward was very attentive and only wanted to please. The food was excellent although I did expect breakfast to be served a bit earlier on when flying from SIN-BNE. I was slightly disappointed with the Inflight Entertainment system. It was not as good as British Airways simply because there was not as much choice. On the return journey it seemed like I had watched everything twice over. However I rather liked how the system did not turn off when the plane was beginning it's descent as it often does with other airlines. The steward was very helpful when it came to disembarking the plane. I was struggling to unload all my things and manage to my two young boys. He took my boys and led them off the plane. This is my first time travelling Etihad normally I would use BA or Cathay Pacific but I have converted over to Etihad now! Overall the best flight experience I have had. I fly at least once a month to AUH business class and every six months I fly First to Australia and will definitely be using Etihad for my future travels.

SYD-CDG via AUH. Very pleasantly surprised. Good service (FA's were friendly and attentive) more than decent food and great inflight entertainment system with live television! Only minus was the B777 on the SYD-AHU leg of the trip which was definitely showing its age. Overall would more than recommend flying Etihad.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Worst flight I have been on. My husband and I flew Business class from Abu Dhabi to London Heathrow in pre-booked seats. A mother and child of 4 had been allocated seats apart which is appalling and we were asked by cabin crew if we would change seats with them just for take off as the little boy was upset. Deceitful cabin crew wouldn't let us return to our seats and we had to sit apart for the whole journey. Dishonest and conniving complained to Etihad they don't want to know.

Flew on 14/4/2014 from Manchester to Abu Dhabi and then onto Jeddah. The first leg of the journey was good but the second leg was of much lower standard with one hour delay at Abu Dhabi.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Flew ORD-MAA-ORD in March/April this year. The good: Food and drink choices were very good inflight crew did they best they could. Entertainment system is among the best. The bad: Cramped seating on 10 abreast 777-300. Some airlines increase seat pitch in this configuration but Etihad still uses 31" pitch. This was unbearable especially on the 15 hour flight from Abu Dhabi to Chicago. No concept of boarding zones. All 4 flights were delayed by at least 1 hour. Connecting in Abu Dhabi is a nightmare. They make you go through security just before boarding which is a primary reason for delays. Buses take passengers to smaller planes. Too many passengers are packed into one bus for a very uncomfortable 20 minute ride. Neutral: US CBP pre-clearance is nice to have but adds to delays. It was already past departure time when passengers were in the US Immigration line. All Etihad flights from Abu Dhabi to the US are delayed by at least 2 hours because of this.

MAN to BKK via AUH and return. Generally faultless service. Staff polite yet not too intrusive. Drinks offered on boarding with offer to request cruising drinks and menu although an anytime menu is available. I slept well on most flights. AUH to MAN delayed with little information given the lounge staff just kept topping up my champagne glass. Flight delay caused by a child misbehaving. Amenity packs have improved. Chauffeur service excellent.

### Etihad Airways customer review
25th March Manchester to Abu Dhabi to Bangkok and flew home 9th April Phuket to Abu Dhabi to Manchester. Flight numbers: EY22 EY408 EY1999 EY15. We flew with Etihad for the first time and it will be the last time there was nothing positive to say about the flight. The seats were so uncomfortable and only acceptable if you are a sardine the food was awful and the air crew were very unprofessional. We have flown with Thai and Eva Air who were fantastic. My husband is very tall and had a miserable flight in my opinion Etihad have spent all their money on the football team and not on their airline.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Excellent flight from London Heathrow to Abu Dhabi. Good comfortable flat beds with extremely attentive staff. Food hot and tasty well presented and an abundance of alcoholic drinks if desired. Toilets very clean and attended to extremely frequently. Entertainment was fine and just right for the length of flight 7 hours. I have travelled several times with Qatar and Emirates Etihad are just as good.

### Etihad Airways customer review
My wife and 4 kids including a toddler took a flight from Karachi to Chicago via Abu Dhabi and from Chicago to San Antonio. The stay at Abu Dhabi was 1 hour 45 minutes. Due to heavy crowds long waiting lines and less staff in Abu Dhabi my family missed their next flight to Chicago. This is second time with us that Etihad failed to provide service as they promise. My family are still at Abu Dhabi airport wondering when their flight will be. Staff are unable to provide them hotel accommodation or next flight info at this time. If you are traveling to meet a tight time or in an emergency do not use Etihad!

### Etihad Airways customer review
I have done several long haul flights with Etihad. I am satisfied with most aspects of their service. However on my last trip I waited 90 minutes in a very slow moving queue to check my luggage in at Sydney and another 90 minutes on the return journey waiting to check in at CDG Paris. I wonder if the airline is cost cutting with check in staff. Then there is the issue of the queue at Abu Dhabi. After alighting the aircraft it is necessary to stand amid a slowly moving sea of humanity all awaiting a re-scanning of hand luggage. On my last trip this wait took over an hour. After a fourteen hour flight it sure takes some stamina. I am thinking of changing airlines.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Although absolutely packed with passengers Etihad (EY32) Paris to Abu Dhabi on 8/4/2014 was one of the best flights I have had in a long while. Staff were polite and very attentive. Etihad complimentary drinks greatly appreciated!

### Etihad Airways customer review
I was scheduled to fly from BKK through AUH to LHR. Etihad run a 'tight' connection at AUH and on this last trip the whole process was a shambles. Their flight into BKK was very late and Etihad suggested that we would not make the AUH connection to LHR. I spent a lot of time (and money) on calls trying to resolve commitments in the UK accordingly. In the end rather than pay for accommodation and similar for (I estimate) 100 passengers they simply made the AUH flight wait two hours and thus inconvenienced over 300 passengers! Investigating their schedules and the way they handle their aircraft (in this case A6ETB) it was clear that they had elected to deliberately run this aircraft late for three consecutive days. When I say late I mean hours not minutes: you can imagine the difficulties that passengers face arriving at LHR and getting out around 10 pm at night rather than at 7 pm. I would and urge everyone who is considering using Etihad to be quite careful they may have an equipment shortage or simply be electing to mess people around as they know that there is limited legislation for a non-EU airline of this nature.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Dublin - Abu Dhabi - Bangkok return economy March 2014. Frequent Flyer and Etihad gold card holder. Etihad are a good but no longer great airline. All flights were punctual. The lounge in Dublin is fantastic. All flight sectors were very busy. Food onboard was OK. The food service onboard seems to take an extortionate amount of time. Also Etihad leave the main lighting on for too long on red eye flight. They should make better use of the mood lighting for those that want to sleep. The seat pitch on the A330 was not good and I could not sleep. The Boeing 777 aircraft with 10 abreast seating and narrow aisles feels cramped but easier to sleep on. The crew were friendly and professional on all sectors. They currently appear to be more interactive and helpful with passengers. I was impressed as I was greeted by name on one sector. IFE is good. Etihad now seem to have a policy of boarding almost an hour before scheduled departure which seems excessive to me. We were sitting on the tarmac after boarding for a least 30minutes on all sectors and I was one of the last few to board. There are still issues with the landing slot in Dublin airport in the morning as no stands are available to park at. Another delay after a 8 hour flight.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Booked on a flight from SGN to AUH and connecting AUH to DUS. I upgraded to Business Class for the flight from AUH to DUS upgrade of the flight was confirmed. Flight was scheduled to leave at 2.20 am from AUH. Without any information whatsoever I received a boarding pass for an entirely different flight: They simply booked me on the Air Berlin flight leaving AUH at 8.40 am! In AUH at the Business Class desk I complained and asked to receive the correct boarding pass for the flight at 2.20 am that I was booked on. They told me that the flight was fully booked and that it was not possible to get me on the flight not even in Economy class.

### Etihad Airways customer review
5th Feb EY12-EY402 returned on 19th Feb EY403-EY17. An airline with modern yet cultural furnishings. Etihad being the national carrier for the UAE have had fierce competitors but have not let it degrade their service. With polite and efficient staff you're welcomed with lush cuisine well presented stewards/stewardesses all topped off with a great entertainment system. Check in was extremely fast boarding was a breeze and cruising was pleasant. Meals are plentiful and delicious with two choices at hand and an additional vegetarian option. Seat comfort and recline brilliant. The airline in my opinion is one of the best. I look forward to flying with them again.

### Etihad Airways customer review
I travel a lot I've been on many different airlines but not one airline can be compared to Etihad except for Emirates. I've traveled in all 3 cabins never have I not been satisfied. The service is the best the entertainment system is excellent toilets are always clean and seats are comfortable. Last trip I had was on EY18 from London to Abu Dhabi in business class. The lounge in London was the best lounge I've been to following the one in Abu Dhabi. Onboard I was in seat 9A a window seat and being able to lay down flat is great. I slept then woke up for an excellent meal. The plane had wifi connection I was able to use whatsapp throughout the flight. The only bad thing was the main course that wasn't that good I miss their steak sandwiches.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Mumbai-London-Mumbai Pearl (Business) Class. The tiny plane from BOM-AUH (courtesy Jet Airways) did not feel anything special other than a slightly stretched economy seat. The Business class lounge at AUH felt stuffy scruffy and least inviting. Couches were occupied by sleeping passengers and food was so spartan it made a mockery of a proper business class lounge. At boarding there was no special fast track for Business Class travelers and we simply had to wait in a long queue. During long haul sections the standard business class stretch seat and cabin did not quite infuse a sense of special feeling and the cabin attendants were barely doing their routine duties and food was no more than ordinary. Really very disappointed. The distinct feeling is the Business Class has been washed down these days to be nothing special even though the price compared is almost 3 times that of economy class.

Flew Sydney-Abu Dhabi-Dublin 5th March 2014. Can not fault the service. Seating good (and I am not a small person - nor am I extra large!) Had G seat - inside aisle - and empty seat beside me. Then two seats between 2 window seats. Water was offered every hour and rubbish cleared frequently Meals more than adequate- toilets clean.

The cabin quality is good crew were courteous and helpful and most importantly the ground staff were co-operative and available guiding travellers to their destination. Food and entertainment was also great onboard. All in all a good experience.

### Etihad Airways customer review
March 9 2014 and flight numbers EY407 EY71. The worst customer service I have dealt with. Staff very rude with zero regards to passengers. We had a total of 24 hours delay on our flight and they did not offer us a hotel or anything and when dealing with feedback staff they did not even apologize. We received a boarding pass and were denied boarding after being re-routed because we were not re-booked properly - although there were free seats on that flight causing us another 11 hours delay.

### Etihad Airways customer review
I traveled several times with them and each time has been a nightmare. Flights being delayed for 4 to 5 hours is common. Last time I flew out of Kuwait the lady at check-in told me: Sorry Sir but the flight is delayed. 2.5 hrs on a 90 minute flight. Of course I was not offered any voucher not even for a drink of water! The worst was my recent flight to Morocco from Abu Dhabi. The flight scheduled to leave at 2 am finally left at 7 am. Not a single announcement was made to inform passengers or to guide them to some desk to get assistance or a voucher. Up to 7 am the airline's website kept listing the departure on time at 2 am. The company was not to blame with the delay the airport was experiencing a failure of the lighting system on the runways. The Etihad service desks were swamped with stranded passengers needing to be rebooked. It was madness to try to get to the desks. Etihad staff was trying their best not to been seen. No attempt was made to bring order to chaos. Things did not get any better once I finally arrived in Morocco. Being so late I had missed my connection. No help from Etihad no one in the airport to guide passengers and assist them.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Used to love flying with Etihad especially when I had my silver status with them. But my last 3 flights with them have lacked heavily with poor customer service 7 hours flight delay in Abu Dhabi and staff didn't provide any quality information unfriendly staff at gate 59 that day last month. Great customer service by staff in Australia and Germany but the UAE headquarters in Abu Dhabi is the one that pulls down the whole airline performance. Seats are still great and entertainment is ok but could be updated a little. Always flying MEL-TXL-MEL. Staff members wake you up while sleeping only to ask you if you want to have dinner. Thinking about doing future travel with Qatar airways.

### Etihad Airways customer review
I was disappointed when I tried before my flight to arrange meals that were both wheat and dairy free. I was told that I must choose one or the other. Business class surely costs enough to cover this. My first meal consisted of a starter - a chicken breast and a main course - another chicken breast! I decided that there was sufficient choice on the main menu to find suitable options. I felt that I was paying enough to be given a gluten free choice. The entertainment was really poor for European travellers.

### Etihad Airways customer review
24th Feb from Manchester to Abu Dhabi then from Abu Dhabi to Lahore. Onboard the cabin crew gave a warm welcome were polite and helped us find our seats. Seats were very comfortable the inflight entertainment was excellent and I like the fact that I could see take-off from my screen. There were not many facilities provided for infants I was traveling with my 2 year old nephew. I disliked that the food was served very late. Another irritating fact was that the airplane was just too cold. Abu Dhabi airport was good there were guides everywhere however the flight was delayed 2 hours. Flight departed 15 minutes late flight from Abu Dhabi to Lahore was quite bad the airplane was not in a good condition and smelt.

### Etihad Airways customer review
EY460 9th March from Manchester to Abu Dhabi. This was my first long haul flight so wasn't exactly sure how it would be. Excellent flight with very attentive service comfortable seats and good inflight entertainment. 2nd leg of journey from Abu Dhabi quite poor in comparison. At Abu Dhabi airport was sent to the wrong lounge and no one seemed to have information on our flight details. Lounge very busy. Once onboard the flight staff initially helpful but that soon wore off. Was offered a drink which I accepted only to have it taken away unfinished with no explanation. Obviously an older plane not the one shown on the website and the seats were a bit worn. I hadn't realised that the flight was with an Etihad partner Virgin. I chose to travel business class for the reason that Etihad have flat beds some help with how to flatten them would have been good. Most people sleeping presume this was the reason there was no meal offered? I had to ask for breakfast I don't really consider a bowl of cornflakes a round of toast or a steak sandwich on a 13 hour flight acceptable. The cost of this flight was £3400 I could probably have a few nights in a five star hotel for that. I have my return journey home in a couple of weeks can't say I'm looking forward to it!

### Etihad Airways customer review
Flight from Abu Dhabi to London 28 March. Transfer from an Air Seychelles flight easy but a long walk. Flight to London delayed but information board gave no reason and how long the delay would be. Ground staff didn't seem to know. A 90min delay. Flight full. Families had been separated and ground staff had no clue how to resolve and were just inept. Boarding chaotic with no order. Shame as once on board and off the ground the cabin staff were excellent. Nothing was too much trouble. Food good - a snack bag to start with (flight left around 3am) and then hot breakfast prior to arrival. Good entertainment system. Seats somewhat cramped - they get in an extra seat across a 777 like Emirates - and seat pitch average. Good fares. Need to improve the quality of ground staff at Abu Dhabi as this spoils a good product in the air especially their cabin staff. Worth considering.

### Etihad Airways customer review
I had flown Etihad business class from Chicago to Abu Dhabi and I rated it as very uncomfortable in fact one of the worst BC seats ever flown. On the return I did first class from Abu Dhabi to New York and the experience was outstanding. The seat was extremely comfortable and the service outstanding. The food was good and varied while the privacy doors around the seat were perfect for a 14 hour trip. I was extremely happy and wish more of the international airlines (American carriers will never get their act together) would provide similar first class experience. I look forward to my next visit to UAE and I will avoid the connection through Chicago and instead use NY.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Brisbane to London Heathrow. March 28/29. This is the second time we've used this airline the first being Business Class to and from Australia from London last year. Our overall feelings? The reputation of the airline as 'the best' seems to us to reflect (if true) on how bad other airlines must be though our experience of Emirates flights London/Melbourne have always been better. We had ample airmiles for upgrade on one leg back but were told these classes were 'sold-out' which on observation passing the seats on exit was patently not the case! The Etihad seats for a tall man like me are a nightmare no way to get a headrest into high position to rest head. The space is confined and restrictive. Although Silver Guest card holders we were never advised that we could book actual seats well before the 24 hour on line service. Whilst many of the aircrew really are very nice some are poor at communicating. The food? Well this time much worse than before mostly inedible and boring. I'm afraid we feel this airline is terribly overrated and will never travel with them again.

### Etihad Airways customer review
SYD-AUH EY 455 5th March. AUH-MAN EY 021 planned departure 6th March actual 7th March. Our major points of contention with the airline and Abu Dhabi airport are: Poor or non existent communication with any of the passengers poor or non existent communication between various members of staff inconsistency of information especially on the airport display boards rudeness from some of the staff (ground crew) although many were polite friendly and tried to calm passengers as much as possible. Abu Dhabi airport does look very impressive from the outside (viewed due to need to use a transit hotel in the city) the duty free/shopping area looks smart and there is a good deal of high tech equipment but: it is small and cramped for the number of passengers travelling through even if the flights are on time staff are either incompetent or badly trained. Communication with passengers is abysmal - PA announcements are limited and the display boards are very inaccurate. The abudhabiairport.ae website is inaccurate and not kept up to date catering facilities would make a small village shopping centre look impressive - and they do not cater for either the volume of passengers or offer them much by way of choices. The idea of queuing in order to get into a departure gate lounge is pathetic at the least and you do not make passengers queue for over an hour just to get to this point. On the plane the service started well with a very attractive stewardess taking our food order but after that they all disappeared. We are used to cabin crew walking thru regularly to check on passengers but with Etihad you have to use the call button! We would not recommend Etihad.

JFK to Mumbai via Abu Dhabi. The staff in Abu Dhabi were very rude they have zero understanding of the boarding process. Flight was delayed by 1 hr and they kept saying the flight was on time. Food was ok. Return journey similar issue. Flight from Mumbai to Abu Dhabi was delayed 2 hrs. Abu Dhabi to JFK flight was good. I would not travel Etihad again.

EY470 SIN-BNE on A332. A lot of gimmicks on their seats. They are very sturdy and you unfortunately need to give it your all for a recline no wonder some people say you can't recline on their Y seats. Cabin crew were a diverse bunch so were their level of hospitality. IFE not the best I have experienced. Food was okay but their tea was too strong!

Flight 0090 March 9 to March 24. Athens to Manila. Almost no empty seats. Food was bad. One sandwich for lunch and plain rice with some beef for 8 hours of travel. Limited space. 30 minutes delay on Abu Dhabi. Good staff. I would avoid Etihad and prefer Emirates or Qatar.

BKK-AUH-DUS in Business. The flight from BKK to AUH was uneventful however in Abu Dhabi the transfer was horrible bad signage arrogant and unfriendly assistance and than the overrated F Class Lounge. The check in to DUS was a complete nightmare there were other flights as well departing from the same lounge nobody really understood what's going to happen. Our flight delayed by hours. Than finally boarding no delays anymore. There was no communication at all. Transfer to aircraft via bus. Inflight entertainment did not work the breakfast served was not eatable at all. On my return journey to Australia I selected a different airline.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Flew from Brisbane to Bristol via Abu Dhabi and to Dublin. As usual excellent flight but chaos in Abu Dhabi both ways. Waited 56 minutes to disembark appeared to be problems getting buses from plane to terminal. Abu Dhabi airport taking far too long with its improvements many less experienced travelers would not tolerate the waiting and misinformation. Being a gold member having very little advantage in Abu Dhabi.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Worst experience from AUH to IAD. After sitting on the plane for 3 hours we had to disembark. Long story very much shortened communication from airline personnel was non-existent. Ultimately the flight arrived 23 hours late. After transmitting my objective impressions to Etihad management I received no acknowledgement whatsoever.

### Etihad Airways customer review
IAD-BKK (via AUH) round-trip. IAD-AUH (A340-600) - flight only 20% full and I had the bulkhead seat with an open seat next to me. Had a great experience with in-flight food entertainment and service. I chalk that up to the empty flight and minimal stress on FA's. Bulkhead seats are normally 75$ per leg but was able to get it during online check-in. Bulkhead had plenty of legroom and you don't have to worry about reclining seats. IFE is slightly smaller and with lower graphics quality. Cons: seats are quite hard halfway through the 12 hr flight my tailbone was so sore I had to sit on a pillow for the rest of trip. Transit AUH - first time at airport and transit in evening was a breeze with minimal lines for transfer/secondary security. I had a short layover so didn't check on the facilities. Food options are limited and expensive. AUH-BKK (777) - completely full flight and boarding process was very chaotic. Basically a complete free for all boarding. They boarded by rows but gate agents were not enforcing it. I will avoid flying on 777 especially with the 3-4-3 set up and the poor seat pitch. Cabin was very hot even though I was just in a T-shirt. FA's did their best scrambling around with the full flight. Seats again were very hard and not comfortable. BKK-AUH (777) - same experience as the inbound flight. Cabin too warm and breakfast food was pretty bad on this flight. By far the worse on the trip. Boarding in BKK still very chaotic. AUH transit with US Customs pre-clearance - 3 hour layover in the early morning and airport was very busy. Secondary security had long lines and had to wait 30 min. Food options is still terrible. US pre clearance at AUH was a mixed bag. No dedicated lines for US citizens. AUH-BKK (A340) - another full flight and a complete reversal in my Etihad experience. FA had difficult time communicating with mostly South Asian customers. Meal service was a zoo - I have never seen so many different special meal requests. There's a 30-40 min lag between special meal service and regular meal service. Special meal customers ended up holding on their meals for 1 hr. Some flyers had to take their own tray back to the FA. Cabin temperature fluctuated a couple times from cold to warm. IAD luggage took forever. Waited for a full 30 min at the carousel from the first bag to my bag. Probably would not fly Etihad economy even with the lowest price. Seat pitch way too small for intl long hauls. AUH transit was not very pleasant with lines everywhere and terrible food options.

Flew (or attempted to fly) EY440 and EY015 Ho Chi Minh / Abu Dhabi / Manchester 7 March. Flight to Abu Dhabi left almost 9 hours late. Utter shambolic chaos at Abu Dhabi. Hundreds of us queuing for boarding cards. Etihad staff apparently beyond even seeming to care. All sorts of wrong/misleading information. Pity any poor person not fit enough to be in a queue for hours on end. Had to wait until same flight 24 hours late to Manchester. I feel I owe Singapore airlines an apology for not flying with them this time. Etihad? Never again!

### Etihad Airways customer review
I flew from Manchester UK to Melbourne Aus via Abu Dhabi. All my flights to and from Melbourne were punctual clean efficient and more comfortable than expected given I was in Coral Economy Class. I have been on long haul flights with a number of airlines to India and USA and I must say that I was most impressed by Etihad and would recommend this Company. The cabin staff were exemplary in meeting the needs of all their guests treated everyone with respect and yet made me feel like a special individual. My only reservation is that if you seat at the back of the plane the menu choices can run out. However it is possible to pre-book a meal from a drop down list when booking.

### Etihad Airways customer review
2 passengers travelling as a couple LHR-HKT via AUH EY18/EY1996 15-16Jan 2014. These flights and the return in March were booked with Trailfinders UK in summer 2013. Seats were requested on the LHR-AUH flights both ways but seats on the AUH-HKT sectors could not be requested as it was operated under a code share agreement with an Etihad partner Air Berlin. The day before departure I visited the online check-in site at the permitted -24 hours to find seats on the first sector had been allocated window and aisle as requested. There was a very limited option for change so it had been well worthwhile requesting at booking. However second sector seats were allocated as 16K and 15D in opposite aisles making travel as a couple impossible. No option for change. I made a request for more equitable seats at baggage check-in LHR and the agent was able to offer us seats together in 20AC on the second sector less attractive seats due to the missing window in this row but otherwise fine. Once underway on time service on the first sector was in the modern CX/SQ mode a little better in some respects a little less so in others. Food was acceptable even tasty with a pre dinner drink and wine with the meal. Missed was the CX mid flight ice cream. Great IFE. Abu Dhabi was a work in progress crowded busy and confusing with the need to pass through security again. Better is promised for 2015. The second sector on Air Berlin was OK reasonably efficient slightly brusque cabin crew attitude and edible rather than tasty food. No pretence of offering a superior service. No alcohol offered on this breakfast flight but I believe it would have been available on request. Slightly primitive IFE. A quick route from Heathrow to Phuket slightly under 15 hours including stopover. Competitively priced 30 kg baggage allowance and service levels as you would expect but such a pity you can't pre-book seats. So home at the end of the return trip and time for a final verdict. Would we use them again? No not unless they integrate more effectively.

Flew from Manila Philippines to Malaga Spain on 8th March. Flight supposed to be delayed for departure from Manila for 2 hours which ended to be 3.5. I lost my connection to Dusseldorf and ended up in a queue along with at least 500 people from other flights and different connections lost. There was no type of prioritization communication from staff and they were totally lost. We were standing in the queue for 5 hours looking at the staff behind the counter. When I reached the counter I kept hearing "one minute sir one minute" for about an hour before getting a new reservation for connections the next morning at 4 am so 20 hours later. I then went to terminal 1 since I had to take my boarding pass from there the guy could not print them from Terminal 3. Went there sat in another queue for half an hour just to be told that I was at the wrong counter to get boarding passes for Turkish airlines and I should move to another. There are no signs whatsoever and no people that could provide useful information. It is acceptable to miss a connection it happens everywhere but the level of incompetence and lack of interest in Abu Dhabi is just ridiculous. Not flying Etihad again.

### Etihad Airways customer review
MAN-AUH-BNE. Travel out Jan 14 return Feb 14. The Pearl experience from start to finish was excellent with a couple of caveats UK chauffeur each way all on time and friendly. Check in and lounge at MAN easy and helpful. Food and drink in lounges plentiful apart from BNE where the lounge is operated by NZ airways and the am food choice limited. The men's lavatory was in need of cleaning and refreshing. In flight al a carte of a good standard as was the anytime kitchen on all legs. Both MAN and AUH lounges can be congested as has been mentioned. A request for a special wheat free diet didn't really work as the two courses offered on the first meal serving were chicken starter followed by chicken main. My companion reverted to ordering off the main menu for all other meals. Gluten free bread was not offered. Transfers at AUH were not clear for fast track passengers and there's no lounge or fast track at all in Singapore on the stop over. Flat beds comfortable I'm 180cm tall and slept well. No jet lag to worry about. IFE not the best particularly western music Mainly B rate films although I found enough to watch. In all a very good experience and would use again.

LHR-AUH-LHR in business class. Started badly as the chauffeur service decided to park round the corner of my building and not tell anyone it took 30 minutes of trying to contact the airline before we finally found them. Got to the airport my flight was more than an hour late due to late inbound equipment. Flight out was okay I had very high expectations as this was my first time with Etihad and I had heard great things. Return flight forget about it. I'm stuck in the mess at Abu Dhabi airport at the moment where technical problems closed the airport briefly. The customer service systems have totally different (and unrealistic) information versus the departure boards in the lounge. Staff are overwhelmed. If you are connecting through this part of the world stick with Emirates I will in the future.

Paris-Abu Dhabi-Melbourne first class. Paris to AUH no staff in first class cabin spoke French. Service was haphazard at best. Sink in main bathroom was blocked and this reported to crew. The same aircraft serviced the AUH-Melbourne sector. The sink was still blocked. This airline has some excellent staff however the standards are extremely uneven and one is left with the impression that training could be improved.

BRU-AUH-KUL and back. Service on board and staff were very good. The seats were very narrow on the first flight but much better on the airplane leased from Jet Airways. The food was quite tasty and the IFE was acceptable. But the transit at Abu Dhabi was terrible. The airport wants to play with the big boys but it lacks the facilities to do so. Way too many passengers than they can handle so extremely long queues. It took me two hours just to get from one plane to the other. Long bus rides from the plane to the terminal and vice versa. Wifi doesn't work properly. I thought Etihad was quite good but because of Abu Dhabi airport I am not going to fly with Etihad again. Next time I will take Emirates or Qatar Airways to go to Kuala Lumpur.

I have flown with Etihad 4 times in Pearl Business. This last flight (from Abu Dhabi to Toronto) will be my last. Prior to this the service was decent - as was the plane. This last was tired old and the staff was MIA. The only time they answered the call button was when I pushed it by mistake. My next trip to India will be with Emirates.

KUL-AUH-LHR 11/2/14. MAS Golden Lounge in KLIA continues to go downhill. Alcohol now served in a completely separate section near the entrance. You really feel like a leper having to walk all the way through the lounge to get a drink. The lounge even though recently refurbished is dirty and already looks tired. Check In was good but everything else until leaving was very poor as MAS also handle boarding and baggage checks at the gate. KUL-LHR flight superb great food staff service wine and the attention staff give each passenger is impressive. Aircraft interior looked like it had be recently refreshed and that was nice Etihad were starting to look a little tired. So well done there. AUH lounge is a disaster too busy and for a flagship it really let's down one of the best airlines around. Boarding was a mess and we ended up standing (no seats) at the gate for 45 minutes. Flight AUH to LHR great as above save for a child in Economy who decided to scream for most of the flight - but the airline can't be held responsible for the bad behaviour of passengers children. Why do people with children believe it is acceptable to trouble everyone else? All in all another excellent trip marred only by the MAS lounge and the transit through AUH lounge. Definitely recommend Etihad as one of the best - hope that now they do KUL twice daily they will invest in their own lounge at KLIA.

Recently travelled to Abu Dhabi from Manchester return. Flight EY021 and EY022. My family and I had flown with Etihad in the past and vowed never to go with them again. We decided to give them a 2nd chance what a mistake to make. The plane looked tired and the seats looked dirty. The seats were positively the most uncomfortable I have had the misfortune of sitting in hardly any space at all. The service was poor and the food awful. I can definitely say I will not be travelling with them again.

EY15 Abu Dhabi to Manchester approx 7hrs. Firstly seat remained in upright position for whole journey (night flight) staff unable to rectify. The cabin was absolutely freezing. Many people wearing overcoats to counter this. I was dressed appropriately for the flight and used the blanket and pillow provided and was still stone cold. Surely this isn't acceptable. Will never fly with them again.

Round trip AKL-SYD-AUH-FRA-AUH-SYD-AKL. First time with Etihad: Flight and service was average but despite the fact I had boarding passes already for the whole trip I needed to queue again at every single stop over airport to have the boarding pass rechecked by Etihad staff. Airport in Abu Dhabi was completely overloaded and couldn't cope with people moving to their connecting gate. But worst thing was the luggage handling! I can't recommend Etihad at all.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Travelled EY38 on 24 Dec 2013. Service was horrible. Stewardess did not smile. My sister and I asked for pasta upon hearing that the stewardess replied rudely that she needed to check and she cannot guaranteed that both of us would get our choice of meals. We told her politely that we could not take the other meal choice due to the meat. She replied coldly we should have asked for special meal. We understand that we cannot guarantee to have our choice of meals given a full flight. However the stewardess could told us politely. This is certainly not the service that I expected. This is the first and last time I will travel with Etihad.

Round-trip SYD-AUH-SYD. Overall excellent experience on all counts. Friendly and courteous staff. The service on the flight was excellent and staff addressed me by name. Cabin Manager came around to make personal introduction and to explain flight amenities. Food was outstanding and the wine choices were top notch. Wouldn't hesitate to fly with Etihad again. Entertainment selection also excellent for long journey.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Travelled from Manchester to Sydney on 11 February have to say Etihad proved that deserves another chance. Despite my previous experience I booked with them and this time it was a pleasant surprise. Food was average but service much better than last time. The legroom was way too small they should consider updating their config for these long routes. Ground services maybe the worst of all the airlines. However I might consider flying them again.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Flew Manchester-Abu Dhabi-Bangkok. Chauffeur picked us up at the arranged time. Check in at Manchester was seem less. Etihad lounge at Manchester is first class with very attentive staff. Etihad business class seat is a little bit narrow and anyone over 6 foot won't be able to lie flat. All seats have direct access to the aisles. If you want privacy I recommend the window seats. The paired seats are very intimate. Food and beverages very satisfactory as too was the service from the cabin crew. Very basic amenity kit was given. Changing terminals in Abu Dhabi was chaotic. Baggage first off the carousel in Bangkok.

18th January EY0455 SYD-AUH. Flight back to Sydney on 5th February EY0454. Recently flew from Sydney to Geneva. The Boeing 777 is a horrible aircraft with cramped kindergarten seats and aisles so narrow that one cannot walk to the bathroom without bumping the shoulders of sleeping passengers. Will not fly with them again.

### Etihad Airways customer review
I had been traveling Etihad for the past 3 years twice a year Business Class KWI-AUH-MNL back and forth. Food comfort and cabin crew are superb. Leaves and arrives on time. Now my only issue was when I am flying AUH-KWI. At Abu Dhabi Airport terminal waiting area Business Class passengers were being treated as Economy Class. For the past 2 flights going back to Kuwait I experienced that there is no special or separate bus for Business Class passengers. We were all being mixed with Economy Class passengers on a single bus. Before Business Class passengers always had a separate bus and had priority on boarding the bus and plane. There used to be a lane for Business Class. As I had mentioned for the past 2 flights I had AUH-KWI this does not happen anymore. I am now thinking of going back to Emirates or Qatar Airways on my next flight to Manila.

### Etihad Airways customer review
I have been doing the same trip in 1st class (Seoul-Paris/London-Abu Dhabi-Seoul) with Etihad every year for several years but have seen standards declining sharply in 2013 and 2014. At every boarding I had to actively look for someone so I could hand them my coat. No welcome aboard and guiding to my seat and nobody addresses me by my name anymore. The Champagne used to be Bollinger but has been downgraded to something cheaper. The quality of the food can vary dramatically depending on the skills of the on-board chef. Despite my request for breakfast yesterday I was not woken up in time and had to do without! The worst perhaps is the chauffeur pick-up  which stressed me enormously. Nobody called me to arrange a time for pick-up in London so I had to call the UAE to arrange it myself. They did not send any text message or email confirmation despite another call to request it. The pick-up was confirmed (orally) for 6.30 am but I was woken up by the driver at 5.15 am. My flight was at 10.30 am and I was a 15 minute-drive away from the airport! On the next leg of the journey Etihad left me a message that a pick-up had been arranged for me in Dubai but the time turned out to be less than 3 hours before take-off and it takes at least 90 minutes to go from Dubai to Abu Dhabi if there is no traffic. It took me countless calls to Etihad. Luckily the driver came on time. All in all I do not envisage traveling 1st class with Etihad again.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Manchester-Singapore-Sydney via Abu Dhabi. First time flying with Etihad and impressed with their service. Planes are modern and the seats in cattle class are acceptable. The in-flight entertainment is ok but not spectacular being too limited in content for long haul. Emirates are better in this context. Abu Dhabi is not one of the better airports to change through and isn't well organised. Each time involved a bus trip to the aircraft. I think it is an airline trying to climb up the ladder and the service was the standout. I would happily use them again.

### Etihad Airways customer review
I've had a much better experience on half a dozen long haul flights with Etihad lately than I've ever had on Malaysian and Singapore. Abu Dhabi is perhaps not the best hub to transfer through but the Etihad aeroplanes are up to date well serviced and the staff are friendly and competent if not outstanding. Travelling with a child on this airline was a breeze and they have special staff roles and extra services to help with kids.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Business class MEL-AUH then economy AUH-LHR. Business class LHR-AUH and again J class from AUH-MEL. Originally booked the entire trip in economy but bidded using Etihad's online upgrade auction that is sent out to select customers. I was successful in all 3 bids. Quick note about economy - the 777-300ER aircraft used a 3-4-3 seating as a lot of airlines are doing these days. The seating is horrible and a massive step down from J of course. Leg room was just adequate. The business class legs were great. The individual 'suites' are very private although the window seats are better and more private than the aisle seats. Seat was comfortable and very comfortable when in 'relax' mode. My only complaint was the bed. Fully reclined the bed is 185cm and I am 184cm. There is no scope for letting your feet hang out over the end of the bed. For a premium product the bed simply isn't long enough for someone who only slightly above average in height. However due to some careful manoeuvring I did manage to get plenty of sleep. Overall the airline was fantastic although transiting between terminals in Abu Dhabi is a pain. The food and service from the cabin crew were wonderful and all flights were on time except or the AUH-MEL leg which was one hour late. The Arabic mezze I had for starters on each J leg was excellent and the lamb shanks were restaurant quality. I didn't drink much alcohol but on the MEL-AUH they had a very nice shiraz that I enjoyed 2 glasses of. Champagne is offered pre takeoff. Amenity kits were basic. The economy section was standard economy. No better no worse and for 7.5 hours wasn't too bad even with a full plane. The trip back from London was very painful for me emotionally as I had lost my mother the day before. The cabin supervisor couldn't have been more helpful.

EY 394 DOH-AUH and EY17 AUH-LHR both on 24/01/14. Doha to London via Abu Dhabi with wife and 2 children. We loved both sectors. Had a bad experience last year but this time - faith was restored. Excellent cabin crew staff - polite friendly and efficient excellent food and very clean toilets. Only areas of improvement would be food quantity and most of all - the E-box inflight entertainment system. A larger variety of movies needed along with more up-to-date releases. Great airline - look forward to the return to Doha next month.

### Etihad Airways customer review
AUH-JFK direct on a Boeing 777 3-4-3 seating in economy class. Had window seat on the right side of plane. Major problem is that when the person in front of me reclined I could not reach my carry-on underneath his seat. The service was very good and inflight entertainment the best I've ever seen in economy. First meal was excellent but second merely average.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Have flown Etihad 4 times from LHR to BKK and will not be using them again I really used to enjoy Etihad but have noticed that their service has dropped to a charter airline and in Abu Dhabi you are treated like cattle when transferring to your next flight it's just chaotic with rude security personnel. The planes look old and tired and the food is below standard will prefer to pay more next time and fly Thai Emirates or Singapore Airlines.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Economy from Dublin to Abu Dhabi First to Sydney January 4th. First flight delayed 60 minutes. Chaotic check in. Very poor service onboard and food one notch above discount airline. No beer or wine offered. 777 plane tired. Second leg to Sydney delayed 2 hours. Excellent service by the staff but first class not up to Cathay Thai or Emirates. Lounge very overrated. Again food onboard was average despite the onboard chef who was very attentive. Will use other carriers in the future.

### Etihad Airways customer review
PRG-AUH-BKK and back in December and January 2014. As the leg from Prague to Abu Dhabi was served by Czech Airlines my comments refer only to the Etihad part. Abu Dhabi Airport needs to improve on signs and information monitors. I guess when switching planes within short time this will be a huge problem. On board the staff were friendly and caring except for the request to increase the temperature. The majority of the passengers were freezing sitting down covered with all available blankets and some even using their winter jackets! This happened on both flights. The food was OK just average airplane food. The entertainment system works well although the screen quality is poor. We usually prefer a long leg without the need for a stop in the middle of the trip so we are unlikely to be re-using this service.

### Etihad Airways customer review
MXP-AUH-PEK INC-AUH-MXP. 3 of the 4 legs on 330-200 with latest business class product. Excellent seat perhaps a little narrow but flat and comfortable for seating and sleeping. Entertainment system very good service excellent very friendly and professional staff. INC-AUH on 340-500 with older business class (the old turquoise seats but recovered with the new stripy fabric clever move Etihad). More cramped and less room but still good for sleeping. No privacy separation between the 2 buddy seats in the middle and if you are not travelling with your companion then it would be embarrassingly close with a shared armrest. Food very good indeed and good wine selection. Would travel again with Etihad. Only negative comment the business class lounge at AUH is overcrowded as it the airport generally. I hope there are plans in place for improvement.

BRU-AUH-BKK and return in Dec/Jan 2014. Outbound: BRU-AUH: A330 with nice seats good entertainment (this was good on all flights) a good cabin layout friendly crew decent food. Transfer in AUH was a disaster with cramped and chaotic boarding change of gate from T3 to T1 with no announcement. AUH-BKK: B777 with 10 seats per row very small seat pitch extremely cramped. We had paid for exit seats with extra legroom but even these seats were extremely narrow and very uncomfortable/hard. My E-box control would not fit into its socket in so it was just hanging down next to the seat food terrible unfriendly crew. Homebound 20 days later: BKK-AUH: Check-in in Bangkok smooth and friendly same B777 as outbound I think since the e-box control in my seat would still not fit into its socket and was still just hanging down next to the seat. Very friendly crew in our section but the one in the other aisle was not. Sandwiches and breakfast (late night flight). Transfer in AUH again chaotic and disorganised with unfriendly a very cramped boarding lounge bus transfer to plane. AUH-BRU: A330 nice and comfortable plane one hour late probably due to chaotic handling of bus transfers onboard crew friendly. For some reason it was freezing cold on all our Etihad flights and despite promises by the crews to raise the temperature this was not done. Passengers had to sit with two blankets and take extra clothes out of their suitcases. All in all we were really disappointed with Etihad and there is truly a marked decline in standards since just a few years ago.

Heathrow-Brisbane via Abu Dhabi. This was the 3rd time I've flown Etihad and I could have cut/pasted my complaints from the last two flights. No seat booking with online check-in with code share despite the fact it was Etihad planes on all legs (sold as Virgin on the AD to BNE leg). My inflight entertainment on the first leg wasn't working so I asked for my system to be reset. After several attempts I finally convinced one chap to have a go at resetting it and it worked! Seats are Ryanair-esque reclining so little they might as well have not bothered. Abu Dhabi airport is as chaotic as a market bazaar. No signage small departure screens tucked away from view blank faced overworked staff. On the leg back we were made to sit on the floor while we waited for the gate to open (an hour late). Finally allowed in the departure lounge. Finally told to board the plane bound for London not by the conventional method of a public address system but by a small lady hollering seat numbers at the other end of the departure lounge. Chaos ensued as everyone rushed to the front and the queue again stretched down the gangway. They get a point for landing the plane at the right airport.

JNB-AUH EY601 (A330) Seat: 36A 11/12/2013: Check-in and Boarding was smooth. Seat configuration of 2-4-2 so was seated a row after family as I wanted the seat with the view. Seat is equipped with IFE (E-BOX) headphone jacks a variety of charging docks (USB Power plugs). 10 mins before push back the Captain announced that the flight was experiencing a problems with its power source and a restart of power unit was required. This scenario caused the push back to be delayed 30-40 mins. The front camera in the Flight Map could be used to view the terrain in-front and below during and after take-off. E-BOX had a selection of Movies Audio Live TV (CNN and some news channels) TV (nice documentaries) games etc. There was a decent collection of movies (multiple languages) and documentaries although not as big a variety as ICE on Emirates. The headphone jack on 36B wasn't working so my co-passenger had to move to another seat which gave me 2 seats to relax. Snack and beverages were served 30-60 mins after departure. The main meal was served 2hrs after departure. There were 3 options between Lamb Chicken and Pasta choose the Lamb had good portions and Appetizer and Dessert. Completed a movie and caught some sleep the mood lighting was good. The seat was a bit un-comfortable for a long flight (8.5 hrs) but due to the vacant seat next to me I could relax a bit. There was ample leg room. A light snack with coffee service was served 2 hours before landing. At AUH plane had to circle in the holding pattern for a while to the delayed arrival. Landing was smooth and taxi to gate +-10mins. The connecting was displayed on the IFE. Was taxied to T1 for connecting flight. Overall impression of the flight was good and pleaseant crew were hospitable courteous and attentive although would have expected beverage and cafe service top-ups after lunch. Toilets were clean and maintained by crew. Flight is recommend.

Flew Manchester to Sydney 18/12/2013. Flight OK apart from 1 hour delay in Abu Dhabi sitting on runway. The return flight on 04/01/2014 was nothing short of a nightmare checked in at Sydney with Etihad partner Virgin Australia. Flight to Abu Dhabi was superb service etc very good. Our cases booked right through to Manchester but told to pick our connecting boarding card up in Abu Dhabi. On arrival the problem started we were told our flights did not show on their system and we were basically cut adrift by Etihad in the middle of the night. Told to pick up our cases from a deserted luggage hall at 3am then had to find the Etihad booking desk managed to book tickets for myself and my wife. The help and assistance we had from Etihad was zero.

DOH-AUH-JNB return. Flight out to JNB was fantastic first leg on an Airbus A320 from Doha to Abu Dhabi a short flight that went smoothly. The were people to meet and assist at Abu Dhabi the connection was very smooth and the onward flight was on a newly refurbished A330 with the newest product in Business Class and the food was superb as was the IFE. Cabin staff were excellent and addressed us by our name I would like Etihad to give a much better amenity kit than the very poor one they give out right now. On the return it was nothing short of a disaster on all levels after arriving at JNB airport and getting our tax work done and checking in our luggage the lady at check in tells us that we will not be flying on Etihad but on Air Seychelles. I would have appreciated it if Etihad would have contacted me before I left my hotel and told me of the situation and given me a choice. The seats on the flight were uncomfortable and very hard though the leg room was good the sleeping position was terrible as it was not straight and the IFE was terrible the screen was very small and the selection was poor I refused to have a meal and just had a glass of Orange juice. I was contacted by Etihad after arrival and they offered me an apology which I accepted I will give Etihad another chance but they could have handled the situation so much better than they did.

AUH-KUL-AUH by Jet Airways aircraft but operated by Etihad Airways. The plane is looking old and most of the seats were torn. IFE selection was good and the food was nice. From check in I would say the crew were very friendly. Overall experience was very good even from KUL take off on time and on time into AUH. The service during entire flight was fantastic with very helpful FA's. I definitely recommend Etihad.

### Etihad Airways customer review
My wife and I flew in Business from LHR to BKK via AUH on EY18 and EY408 on 16th/17th October. Business Saver fare was an absolute bargain. We booked the limo service from Suffolk to LHR and this arrived on time and dropped us outside T4 for an additional charge of just £20 since our home was just outside the 100 mile trip limit. Quick check-in having pre-booked our seats and apart from the pretty useless Fastrack courtesy of Heathrow's disinterested staff we were in the lounge shortly thereafter. As lounges go it was fine - quiet comfortable and good service. Boarded 15 mins before departure with no delay and the gate was conveniently opposite the lounge. Jacket taken and champagne provided. Settled into comfortable seat in the Airbus 340 the excellent cabin staff explained the menu and took orders alongside after take-off drink requests. Flight took off on time and the rest of the inflight service was outstanding. The freshly made steak sandwich as a snack from the kitchen was as good a snack as I have had on any airline. Arrived into AUH on time but we had gated at the old terminal and had to transfer to the new one for our flight to Bangkok. Business lounge was very busy so we went in the First Class lounge and had a shower. Boarded EY408 on time and had a trouble free flight to BKK in a 777 this time but pretty similar set-up. Steak sandwiches just as good. Arrive BKK slightly ahead of schedule and given card to use its Premium lane so was cleared of immigration and collecting bags of carousel in quick time. Return leg was exactly the same with excellent service throughout and punctual arrival into LHR. My only gripe? The complimentary chauffeur. I initially booked one for arrival in BKK to our hotel but never got confirmation and when I tried to it seemed their was some confusion as to eligibility (2 journeys per adult passenger). Since it is hardly an expensive taxi from the airport to downtown Bangkok I cancelled it to make sure that we had the return from LHR to home but given the confusion wanted to make sure this was understood. I had to call Etihad in AUH in the end and it took ages and then started getting calls from the limo company in Bangkok advising what time they would be collecting us! When we arrived back at LHR they had organised a car for me and a car for my wife! We declined and continued our journey together. Seems like the system on these could be improved but it did not detract from the superb service.

My wife and kids (5 yr old and 8 month) travelled from Chicago to Chennai on Dec 9th. As my wife and kids were travelling without me I selected Etihad because of the reputation it had and also the promise of an onboard nanny. 5 hours ahead of the flight departure I went to book a bassinet for my 8 month old just as was told that I cannot book a bassinet seat online and had to do in person. I had to wait 30 mins at the check in desk for the bassinet seat as they told me there was none available. Later they gave a bassinet seat for my wife/infant and 3 rows away a seat for my toddler. Finally all completed in 30 mins and we were let go with bassinet seat and seat beside for my toddler son. My wife and kids boarded without issues. However their cabin baggage was put elsewhere because the flight was full it was total chaos. The flight took off 3 hours late. As the flight left 3 hours late connecting flight from Abu Dhabi to Chennai would be missed if the connecting flight was not delayed. The stroller for the infant was sent to the connecting flight directly. My wife had to carry the infant and walk with the 4 yrs old 2 cabin bags and laptop bag. Why was there no service offered. I would not suggest this flight to family's travelling with toddlers and infants.

My family and I were flying Etihad from Abu Dhabi to Bangkok on 18th Dec 2013. The flight was 3 hours delayed and no service was given like a drink or food voucher and it was not operational problems. As an example we were about 250 passengers having boarded the flight and then a further delay of 1 hour as Etihad wanted to wait for 4 passengers. The captain in his first delay announcement did not even apologise for the delay and the crew did not feel responsible either and did not apologise. I and my family will never fly Etihad again.

BKK-AUH-CAI. Flight from BKK to AUH was on a Boeing 777 and excellent Pearl Business lay flat seats. Flight from AUH to CAI was a very old Airbus 319. Small plane cramped seating old and worn fabric. Recliners didn't really recline and the screen was in the armrest. Limited menu due to 4 hour flight time. Uncomfortable and ridiculous for the amount we paid.

Poor Service BNE-SIN-BNE no recognition of Frequent Flyer status. Outbound leg no immigration cards for SIN but Cabin Manager did not bother to advise. If you can't load a plane or actually have someone meet the aircraft with the immigration cards in 7.5 hours there is something wrong. Will not fly again.

Heathrow to Sydney via Abu Dhabi. Flight was packed with kids - obviously the sales pitch of the Norland trained nanny worked though I didn't see much evidence of them being around there was a lot of screaming/squealing all through the flight. Seat allocation is a nightmare be sure to get on-line as soon as you can and book your seats do not leave it until you get to the airport or you'll end up wedged in the middle of a middle section. I've flown a lot on many different airlines and I found the seats in this one incredibly tight and uncomfortable so much so that I woke up in the middle of the night once I got home because my back was so sore. The food was pretty ordinary in the middle of a 14hr leg to Sydney we got a cold bread roll with three thin slices of tomato on it. I have never been so hungry on a plane! The final service before landing was rushed with the staff basically tossing the food at us from piles in their arms there was only one choice and half the contents of my tray were missing but the staff were so stretched I didn't bother to harass them about it. The 30kg baggage allowance and the large toilets on board are good points but the rest of it was pretty average.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Manchester to Kuala Lumpur via Abu Dhabi on New Year's Eve. On boarding dispute over 2 people sitting in wrong seats woman refused to move stewardess did not know how to handle it eventually after unsuccessfully pleading with her to move she told the couple whose seats they were that she would find them somewhere else to sit but they would be apart naturally they refused! Meanwhile nobody else could get past to get to their seats. Service on board was extremely slow we had the wrong menu card. Even though the Cabin Crew were wearing 'Happy new year' hats when we boarded there was only a passing reference to it being 2014 as we passed over Romania. Abu Dhabi airport experience was an awful chaotic shambles. Multiple flights arrived simultaneously and they clearly could not cope with the thousands of passengers in transit. Nobody knew what they were queuing for or even if they were in the right terminal. Airport staff were taking no notice of those who were trying to tell them they would miss their connection if they stayed in the queue luckily we had a 3 hour wait so we were not worried just bemused at the chaos. Security control was a joke only 6 manned and shouting to us to 'leave everything in your bags'. Not looking forward to going back through on the way home. Food on board was nothing special entertainment not brilliant headphones didn't work. Overall not a good experience would not use Etihad again travelled to KL with Emirates last time and there is no comparison. Must say however that landings were excellent hardly a bump.

AUH to GRU: Cabin was hot and meal wasn't very good. I'm not demanding in terms of food but was not happy to see my wife and children barely eating. I thought the a/c had a problem I just had a t-shirt on and I was sweating. Second leg back to AUH: Again the cabin was too hot - very uncomfortable. It seems nonsense to keep temperatures high inside the airplane until someone complains. The flight attendants were very nice. Food again was a problem: we barely touched our first meal the last meal at the end of our flight my wife and children didn't even accept. Seat comfort entertainment are the usual similar to Emirates. Unfortunately I will not give Etihad another chance.

Departed Brisbane 24 Nov 2013. We found this flight extremely disappointing. Being a family with small children the main priority for us was obviously to have as smooth a trip with the children as possible. We were recommended Etihad as they advertised to have a nanny onboard and are good with the children. We flew Brisbane to Singapore onward to Abu Dhabi onward to Paris onward to Toulouse in France. The children were not spoken to nor were we introduced to a nanny as per Etihads advertising until the Abu Dhabi to Paris flight. The nanny in this flight was very pleasant. However on the previous flight I had to ask for water twice before it was brought. We are returning to Australia with Etihad unfortunately. Hopefully the service is better. I would not recommend etihad to a family. I would recommend Etihad to an individual as the food was reasonable entertainment was good and the seats are as comfortable as any other airline.

Toronto to Trivandrum by business class. On the plane from Toronto to Abu Dhabi the cabin staff were more interested in selling duty free goods than serving passengers any food. I had to ask the flight steward to serve breakfast to my son who was awake for at least 45 minutes. The trip from Abu Dhabi to Trivandrum was good. The lounge was good but Terminal 1 was crowded and poorly organized. There was a long line up to check in and business class passengers were not given any priority. On our trip back the 13 hour flight from Abu Dhabi to Toronto was a disaster. They only served dinner and did not serve any food afterwards in business class! I had to ask for a cup of coffee which arrived minutes before landing in Toronto. I don't think I will be travelling Etihad again unless they change their service to passengers.

EY 23 Abu Dhabi - Düsseldorf International. Only 4 check in counter open for Etihad flights at AUH airport terminal 3. Boarding chaotic with no sequence. Plane well maintained and clean. EY's biggest problem is their poor seat pitch and hard seats. This was one of the most uncomfortable flights I have had in a long time. Lots of kids on board parents had to wait for a long time to get their bassinets set up bottles warmed up etc. Then some time ago with big fanfare announced "dedicated inflight nanny" could not be seen anywhere. Staff were friendly but it was obvious that they were severely understaffed. IFE well below the standard of other middle eastern carrier.

I just returned from Abu Dhabi to Manchester on 1st of January with Etihad. I have to say the service and the crew was above of all my expectations. It was a very pleasant surprise after my experiences flying different airlines. Their care for passengers was obvious very attentive and smiling crew throughout the flight. The seats however made me suffer a bit but overall it was a nice experience. I would definitely choose them for my next flight.

Chengdu China to Manchester UK on 29th December. Now the service on the flight from Abu Dhabi was nothing to sing and dance about a busy flight with every seat booked out and cabin crew just scrambling about to keep everyone fed and watered. They did remember my special meal but it was an odd breakfast combination but this is the only reason food and beverages did not get five stars from me. Chengdu to Abu Dhabi: While the ground crew at Chengdu were clueless the cabin crew on this flight were excellent. Attentive and interested in the well being of passengers they conducted regular cabin walks and brought water every hour to passengers in economy. They even conducted a chocolate run going through the cabin during the night to see if anyone watching films or reading would like individual chocolates with another drink. On landing they were helping get baggage down and giving directions for first timers to Abu Dhabi about gates.

This was my return flight back to Manchester my departure flight was poor bad service on the MAN-Abu Dhabi leg and Abu Dhabi-BKK was only slightly better yesterday's flights were totally different the service on both legs of the flight were exceptional good food drinks service very good could not fault any of the service side of the flight what I would say is that Etihad need to invest in new aircraft or refurbish the existing fleet as the seats and interior are getting very tired and uncomfortable. I will try another airline next year just to compare the airlines but if Etihad Want to retain their high status they need to listen to the customers that use their airline.

Chicago to Abu Dhabi on New Year's Eve. Departure board said "on time". Flight scheduled to leave at 8pm. Boarding started promptly at 7pm. Told we could get in line and board the plane first as we had child with us. This did not happen. As it got closer to 8pm passengers were being rushed to sit down and stewardesses were hurrying around trying to find places for excess carry-on bags. 8.30 pm - still on the ground waiting for plane to be de-iced. 9pm - plane still on ground. 9.30 pm - announcement there is medical condition on board. Have to pull back up to gate to unload passengers and offload their luggage. 10pm - still on ground waiting to be de- iced. 10.30 pm - still waiting. Midnight: Happy New Year! Still in Chicago and plane still at the gate. 12.30 am - have to be de iced again and announcement made that we were waiting for runway to be cleared. 1.30 am - we finally take off. No hot food served. Lousy cold sandwiches served only after siting about 5 hours.

All four legs were in business class taken during November 2013. The boarding process following a restful hour or so in the Airline's dedicated lounge at Heathrow was smooth efficient stress less and punctual. Aircraft (a Boeing 777-300) was as expected clean and in pristine condition. Although the seats in this cabin class were somewhat narrower than many other major carriers they were well appointed and functional as was the in-flight entertainment system. Food was of a high standard and served with a smile. My few requests (via the button) were answered promptly and I did not feel that they were in any way considered to be a nuisance. Arrival at Abu Dhabi and transfer to the next flight was seamless and I was soon on board. Cabin attendants were as professional as had been on the first leg as was the food. My in-built clock nudged me to operate buttons and turn my seat into a bed. It was time for some sleep. This was when the narrowness of the seat became more noticeable a pity really as a couple more inches would have given much more comfort. Following my tour”of Vietnamese culture and cuisine I returned to Bangkok - placed the top layer on and prepared for my return to London. This time after check-in I was directed to the airport's Apricot Lounge prior to boarding. Although quite a peaceful refuge its facilities fell far short of the Airline's own lounges. As expected the journey times against the prevailing jet streams were much longer but they were offset to some degree by the good service and ambience of the aircraft's business class cabin. Overall my experience of Etihad Airline certainly falls into the to the 'Very Good' category and if I had to give it marks out of ten it would score a solid nine.

I booked to travel from MAN to AUH on EY22 on 20th Dec. I called EY's call centre to upgrade using miles/cash to business where I was assured that there are plenty of seats available and should head to the airport 3 hrs before departure to process this. The information given was completely incorrect as the desks opened 4 hrs before departure and all seats were taken by then which was very frustrating and disappointing. EY ground staff and EY's Business class lounge staff at MAN acknowledged the mishap and were very courteous and attentive and attempted to solve this problem. Return flight on EY21 on the 29th of December light load in J class we were well looked after by the excellent crew in J. as usual EY's catering is excellent cabin crew attentive and good hard product. I just wish they sort out the unhelpful call centre and bring back the old amenity kits in J class with Aigner products that were infinitely better than the current cheap substitutes.

Never Again. Rome-Abu Dhabi (Alitalia Business Class). Abu Dhabi-Melbourne (Etihad). Food excellent on Alitalia flight and entertainment system and service very good this after experiencing the worst business class lounge I have ever been in at Rome. Went to buy a sandwich at bar outside after 5 minutes. No computers showers or food and small bar. Arrived Abu-Dhabi check in and business class lounge good but crowded. Plane terrible. Narrow seat not comfortable. Old seat. Promotes internet from device did not work. Service terrible. Movies poor. Plane old and uncomfortable. Drinks limited. Looking at leaving Emirates and Singapore will not be doing any time soon.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Business Class ticket for Abu Dhabi - Hyderabad India leg of a journey originating in Toronto Canada. Decided to shave and shower before the flight. Lukewarm water one bath towel no facecloths and no amenities kits in the bathroom. Etihad simply outclassed by Emirates on this score. Presented myself at the boarding gate at the appointed time. No priority check-in for Business Class passengers told that we would be ferried to the plane on a separate bus once it arrived no such thing happened Business Class passengers last to board the plane. Meal service a farce: stewardess extremely apologetic for not being able to serve my requested appetizer main course and dessert!

I flew 1st class Shanghai - Abu Dhabi - Heathrow. Lets start with the bad points we were collected from the Hilton by a driver wearing jeans in a car that needed a clean to be delivered to the airport. On arrival we were looked after promptly by Etihad ground staff and made our way to the 1st class lounge shared with Air China. This was not as good as many business class lounges and was happy to be moved on ASAP. Now the fun part on sitting down in seat 1A and drinking a glass of quality bubbly I had a very well cooked steak and drifted off for the night part of the journey. We arrived at Abu Dhabi and went through to the 1st class lounge quick shower bite to eat felt excellent. Went onto the next leg Abu Dhabi - Heathrow I must admit the level of service on this leg of the journey was the very best I have experienced. The team were a real credit to Etihad. I had a friend who was flying business class come up and join me for what was a fantastic meal all ushered through by the main steward without any hassle.

### Etihad Airways customer review
LHR to Abu Dhabi and Dhaka Dec 25-26 in economy. Etihad's economy product is inferior to that of Emirates. Seats small and uncomfortable. IFE not as good. Food however is excellent. Three choice of entrees and the option I chose was very well prepared though a little stingy in portions. FAs pour alcoholic beverages from large bottles in tiny amounts. Wine selection was poor even for economy and their wine bottles were empty by the time they came to me. On the whole however the FAs on the first sector were gems. They provided service from the heart with genuine smiles. But they were horribly inefficient. It took them 4 hours from take off to finish dinner service and turn the lights down. And this was on a 6 hours night flight. An hour before landing they served breakfast wraps (much appreciated) which Emirates does not on similar flights to Dubai. Economy FAs on the flight to Dhaka were functional. Migrant workers from Bangladesh needed to be transported and fed and that is all the FAs achieved. No smiley engagements as in the first segment. Not impressed.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Manchester to Melbourne : I was dreading this trip as I was travelling alone and had never flown long haul before- but I can't wait to go again. I was upgraded to Business Class for the 14 hour trip back from Melbourne to Abu Dhabi which was wonderful but even in Economy I was well looked after. The food was as good as it can be under the circumstances and the in flight entertainment was excellent. I didn't need the book I had brought with me at all. Staff were as attentive as they could be and I disembarked feeling I had had excellent value for money. I got to my destination safely. Some people expect way too much. If you want to be spoilt pay up and fly first class- and stop moaning.

Flew from Abu Dhabi to Melbourne in business class on November 21. This was an Airbus with very small seats and no space to put my handbag or a glass of water. Even though the seats were lie-flat they were just too narrow to move. No privacy whatsoever. Overall a terrible flight.

### Etihad Airways customer review
I have flown this route before with Etihad Manchester - Abu Dhabi - Bangkok first leg of the flight the stewardess seemed to keep the service for one side of business class so we had very limited and poor service no drink on arrival at seat no face towel very poor service. On the Abu Dhabi to BKK leg unless you asked for something you got nothing apart from a smile if you were lucky unless the flight home improves I will not fly with Etihad again there seems to of been many changes in the last twelve months as last years flights were perfect.

### Etihad Airways customer review
MAN-AUH-BKK in the last month. Chauffeur pick up and lounge at Manchester were excellent. Lounge in AUH was crowded. I noted that several passengers in the lounge were not travelling business class but were sprawled over the limited seating. Boarding at BKK was haphazard with no priority for premium passengers. This was my 5th trip this year with EY in Business class. I have noted some deterioration in standards but once on board this is compensated by the excellent service and meals.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Travelled from Jakarta to London Heathrow. Miserable experience with little to no customer service whatsoever. On both flights I wasn't even offered one drink aside tea or coffee during the dinner/breakfast service! I was also woken up three times whilst wearing a seatbelt to be told to put it on despite it being fastened clearly visible over the blanket! It seemed the only thing crew were interested in was the mandatory trolley service. Beyond that cabin service was non existent. My summary never again.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Travelled SYD to AUH October 2013 on a 777. Wow what a shocker. The lack of space was disgraceful for a long haul flight (or even a short one for that matter). My knees wouldn't fit had to put them either side of the seat in front and shoulders touched the people sitting next to me. Never again with Etihad.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Jordan to Sydney via Abu Dhabi. The transit in Abu Dhabi - long queues in hot and airless conditions - was a nightmare. My computer cables were all confiscated from my hand luggage by airport security. No signs and no warning from Etihad about this regulation. The Ethiad check in was chaotic with endless checks and then the flight was delayed We sat on the tarmac for an hour in the heat. It was 2.5 hours before I got water given and it was only because I asked for it. The food on board was so bad. There was no menu choice offered for the second of the meals hours later and people near refused it completely. Never again.

Flew from Manchester to Sydney return via Abu Dhabi. Must say the flights were good. Abu Dhabi airport is a nightmare very busy and chaotic. Upgraded to business class for Abu Dhabi to Sydney and that was good. My problem relates to the customer services that they offer. It is very limited lip service that does not resolve any issues at all. I was charged double for the upgrade an Etihad mistake. I will not fly with them again.

### Etihad Airways customer review
JFK - Abu Dhabi - New Delhi on Dec 9. First leg was a bad experience. I inquired with the crew about the reason for such poor service delivery it turned out they only had 6 crew members to take care of 300 passengers. If you are flying at 9.40pm and don't see your dinner before 1.30am this can't justify any cost savings. I have been on shorter flights before and mostly they are able to provide full service even on flights of less than 2.5 hours. The crew were so small that even a small emergency can totally disrupt the service to whole plane. There was a health emergency and I must say the crew did pretty well. Other leg (of 3 hours) also had the same problem. I got my lunch in the last 40 mins of the flight that was after asking for it again. They had to stop beverage service minutes after they started it because the plane started descending.

Flew MEL-AUH-DUB. Booked business and got unexpectedly upgraded to First Class for MEL-AUH leg. Luxurious. Private cabin. Flight attendants were excellent. Wine and Champagne delicious. Lamb shanks were cooked to perfection. First Class flat bed is wide and long and allows for a great sleep / comfortable flight. AUH-DUB trip was business class. The business class flat bed is not long enough for people over 6". I recommend a window seat for tall people - there is 'extra' space for your legs / feet between seat and side of plane.

Flew in September to Hong Kong via Abu Dhabi and can't praise the staff and airline highly enough for the standard of service and attention. AUH-HKG is code share with Air Mauritius which was an interesting experience but again the staff and meals were terrific. Wouldn't hesitate to travel again and for the price out performs Emirates hands down.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Etihad are getting a lot worse. Four years ago when we flew with them for the first time they were excellent a true 5 star experience even in economy. Now 3 star at best. They seem to have been taking lessons on customer service from Ryanair but without the cheap fares to compensate they will just alienate their customer base. Emirates and Qatar are now much better and from Manchester offer alternative routings at similar cost. Flew out of Manchester and jobsworth checking hand baggage size and weight really degrading for what is sold as a luxury airline. Didn't have same experience at AUH on way home although check in a complete shambles there.

Bangkok to Abu Dhabi. Previously travelled A340 with them and it was acceptable but this trip on Boeing 777 was torture. Ten across seats should not be allowed and will never fly this airline again. Serving trolley bumped into my shoulder no less than 6 times and have bruise to prove it! Cabin felt so claustrophobic and long queues as travelers could not get passed service trolley to bathroom. This was made worse by repetitive claims they are an award airline - what for the most cramped seats? Never again and would warn all others thinking about using this airline that their Boeing 777 should be carefully avoided. Will take a connect in future on Emirates or Qatar.

I traveled from Washington D.C to Bangalore India. Never again will I make such a mistake! Checking in our bags at Dulles the ground staff were overly picky about the weight per bag not he total weight per passenger so I was there along with innumerable folks re-packing my suitcases. Then the hand baggage was weighed - not once but 3 times the last one being just before we got on the plane. This staff member came with a portable weighing scale and rechecked. When I got on the flight it was literally empty same thing with the return flight. I will never fly on this airline again.

EY404. Business class. AUH to BKK. Product seems much better then than - AUH product. B777-300 has larger PTV and has more storage flight seat pitch is bigger. Before take-off offered the option of pre-ordering drinks and meals. Dine anytime. As soon as at cruising height the drinks were dutifully served individually. Avoid row 11 as immediately in front of galley for economy class so very noisy. Served hot nuts choice of crab tian mezze parsnip and apple soup spiced land ouizi pan fried sturgeon tenderloins beef with red current jus. No complaints whatsoever although the amenity kits are now poor quality and basic no designer products.

MAN to AUH. Delayed landing due to fog so diverted to a regional airport after circling for a while. Plane needed refuelling and awaited weather improving. Once landed had to stay on plane but doors opened and soft drinks muffins and pastries supplied. Kept fully informed of situation by the pilot. PTV kept on and comedy sketch shows available. Delayed about an hour however whilst on board I received a text message from Etihad to inform me I would be transferred to another flight. On arrival at AUH boarding tickets awaiting us the next flight was held for us and our luggage even made the transfer. Completely efficient service. On board the meal selection in business consisted of anytime dining Aarabic mezze oven baked chicken! mushroom soup! chicken biryani! rack of lamb (exquisite) pan seared scallops tagliatelle cheeses desserts and ice cream. On board service excellent without being too intrusive.

Will travel more often if this type of service continues.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Flew from Buffalo to Mumbai via Chicago and AUD. American Airlines from BUF to ORD. From previous experiences with BA and other better airlines I was carefree about connecting at ORD. Only to realize later that I had to go through another check-in at another terminal. Reaching the check-in counters there was a long queue. Apparently everyone was waiting to check-in. So even with the boarding passes I had of AA they meant nothing. Nowhere did anyone tell me about rechecking in. I waited patiently. Elderly passengers who were also connecting from different cities in the US were annoyed. A rude man walked up and asked everyone with AA boarding passes to queue up separately. I was to fit my industry standard carry-on bag in a non-industry standard bag frame. I was told that I will have to check my bag. Having already paid in Buffalo for excess luggage it seemed like a way of making money out of people's miseries. So apparently the check-in was another money collecting routine by the airline. Went through security again. By the time I reached the gate it was chaotic: noise and chaos galore. Onboard the seats were hard space was tight. FAs were nice and pleasant. Inflight entertainment was ok. Food service and drinks service was very good. Liked the fact that they had steel cutlery. Connecting at AUD was painful. Long walk. The walkways were not helpful. AUD to BOM flight was in a Jet Airways plane. The interiors were old. Run down. General drunk passenger. FA handled him courteously. Food was good again. Inflight Service was very good throughout. Will fly Etihad maybe Business/First because if you're Economy no one cares.

I recently travelled (Nov 24 2013) from Washington DC - Abu Dhabi - Hyderbad (India). The only problem I had on my journey is from the inlight staff. I was traveling with a six month old baby. In order to get a small cup of water I had to ask three times. The flight staff were not willing to offer any help when required and whenever I called for some help they never showed up. I hope this will be my last trip with this airline.

During my trip from Washington DC to Chennai the nightmare started in IAD when they forced us to remove things from hand luggage when the weight was 7.05 kg. I was asked to remove the 0.05 kg! I was travelling with my wife and two kids but were only carrying 2 carry on and two laptop bags and 3 check-in bags. so we rearranged things and were able to get it all through without throwing anything away. Then towards the end of the flight I went back to the kitchen area to get water the flight attendant couldn't find a cup and she just picked up a couple one of the two cups already had a little water in it. The flight between Washington DC and Abu-Dhabi is long. 13 hours going east and 15 hours going west. After a few hours the restrooms smell with water everywhere. Abu-Dhabi airport is horrible no trams/trains connecting the terminals. After 13 to 15 hours on the flight walking and standing in security lines - horrible experience.

Brussels-Abu Dhabi-Bangalore November 9. One of the totally "I don't care about you" type of airlines. From Brussels to Abu Dhabi I tried to get a drink of water. Pressed the call button and someone came over after 30 minutes. Again about 2 hours before touch down pressed the call button. This time nobody even came by. Even after calling twice.

AUH-JFK-AUH AUH-SIN-AUH both in business. Excellent seat excellent staff very good food and beverages. Very satisfied with the service. Complimentary chauffeur service was also very good which is something you don't normally get as a business class flier in the other airlines. Overall I am very satisfied with EY the only downside is their horrible terrible Customer Service responses. When something goes wrong (such as claiming missing miles) you will test your endurance and tolerance level to the limit. Often you encounter extremely slow or no responses even if you get responses you will likely see the customer care staffs making so many mistakes so you will have to start the claim process all over again. I can guarantee the worst quality customer care center really kills the EY's reputation.

I flew return from Sydney to Abu Dhabi with in a trip to Norway and back. I found this airline to be fairly good. The food quality was good though maybe more water rounds would have been helpful. Seats were relatively comfortable though being when the person in front put their seat back it seemed to be a big recline. I was in the seat with the wall behind me and not able to put mine back as far to compensate. Leg room was much better than Air Berlin who I have traveled the other part of the trip. Staff were friendly and assisted as needed to all especially those with small children. My only complaint was with the toilets. The sink was blocked straight after take off one ran out of toilet paper and by the end of the 16 hour flight were revolting. Cleaning needed to be done during the flight and was not.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Flew economy London - Abu Dhabi - Male return previously always flow Emirates however this fare was £500 cheaper in the sale so thought we would try them. The two flights on the larger planes in and out of London were awful no leg room and as other people say when you recline your seat the base goes forward leaving you with no leg room. Even my 9 year old was not comfy the seats are hard and narrow. The flights from Abu Dhabi to Male were better more room bigger seats however toilets are at back next to galley so a nightmare squashing in and out. Food on all sectors was disappointing given a brown paper bag with a sandwich. Had run out of our choice on one leg. Found staff in general to be very abrupt. Also one drinks service coming into London. I also don't like that when I asked for a gin and tonic they mix it themselves instead of giving you the mini bottles so you have no idea how much they have put in. Thought the entertainment was okay but nothing amazing. Apart from the minimal leg room the worst part was being stuck for 3 hrs in Abu Dhabi airport. It is small with very limited eating areas Abu Dhabi to male we didn't even have seating at the gate everyone was on the floor then straight on. Queues for transit both ways were horrendous and badly organised we were in the end taken through the business express lane. If you are used to Dubai airport I don't recommend it. I wish we had spent the £500 more and flown Emirates. Will never fly again with Etihad.

### Etihad Airways customer review
ORD (Chicago) - AUH-BOM (Mumbai India) in March 2012. I'm 6 feet tall. Negatives: They have the least amount of leg-room I've experienced on any airline. The articulating seat pan makes the problem unbearable - when you recline the seat back your seat cushion moves forward thrusting your knee into the seat in front of you. The worst part is that I had to endure with this on a 14+ hour transatlantic flight. Understaffed - slow service. They only allow 7kg/~15lbs for carryon baggage. This equates to a near empty rollaboard or a small backpack. Positives: You can redeem American Airlines miles on their airline. I got safely to my destination.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Comfortable - no space - none competency - lacking. My parents and I travelled from Dublin to Abu Dhabi and then to Sydney on Oct 25th and return on Nov 15th. I am just 5ft 3 and I found seat space minimal. Food was disgusting on both journeys. We found the staff rude and unhelpful. They ran out of food and by time they got to us there was no choice left. One of the air hostess actually said to me 'I have nothing left for you. I guess I can check 1st class but don't hold your breath'. I was polite to all staff but was ignored on more than one occasion. As for Abu Dhabi the airport is easy to get around but again the staff are lacking in basic customer service. Will never travel to Abu Dhabi again nor will I fly with Etihad again.

A330-200 SIN-BNE. Not a pleasant experience. Plane interior looked dated seat was very uncomfortable and leg room was extremely tight. I would have thought this pitch suitable for a short haul route but not long haul. Entertainment was so-so better than some but not up to their competitors standard. Snack after take off was adequate given the time of departure (chicken wrap or pumpkin and fetta) I was just given one and had no idea which it was until biting into it but took a very long time for anything to be served or offered. Breakfast was quite decent although served extremely early before arrival. Service took a long time to complete due to only one crew operating my side of the cabin. There seemed to be a distinct lack of crew throughout the economy cabin. Nothing else was offered between services. Blanket and pillow were good as was amenity pack. What lacks was the seat comfort. Crew were polite and seemed to work hard to compensate for the lack of comfort.

Emigrating so 30kg better than standard 23kg will be flying soon as far as Brisbane.

No rest rooms near departure waiting areas.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Flew Economy recently as part of a Virgin Australia fare Etihad covered the Sydney-Abu Dhabi-London leg on the way to England thankfully just the London-Abu Dhabi segment on the way back. Awful flights would avoid booking with otherwise great Virgin again if we're forced to use Etihad Airways their "code share partner". Very cramped and uncomfortable seats with a lack of legroom for tall people like me. Had a full flight very stuffy and noisy mix of rude passengers. Cabin crew tried but seemed tired and understaffed. Food was good Entertainment system was okay but a more limited selection than Air NZ and other airlines flown between Australia and Europe before. Stopover in Abu Dhabi was terrible on way to London huge lines and delays in overcrowded stuffy terminals to go through passport checks (twice) ground crew were rude. Inflight ads kept going on about how the airline had been named best airline for the umpteenth year running ? Cannot understand why will do best to avoid at all costs in the future.

### Etihad Airways customer review
BKK-GVA & LON-BKK. I have flown Etihad many times since they first started up and they are getting worse. The price of their business class tickets are now the same as airlines that fly direct. It was worth flying them when they offered a cheaper fare but not worth it now for the following reasons. Lounges both in Abu Dhabi and London a disgrace crowded with useless staff. A new policy that you only get 2 limo transfers per trip I am gold but the person traveling me was not. Bangkok refused to confirm if my travel companion could travel with me on the London transfer. It took 4 phone calls in London to get it sorted. Menu choice is now boring. Entertainment system is full of old movies. The seats on the BKK to AUH sector are old. This airline keeps stating its the best - does its management fly other carriers. The management should also try calling its offices in Bangkok and London and have to wait forever to be answered.

This airline is now black listed on our travels. We were not allowed on the flight due to over booking. There were 4 of us travelling and seats were scattered over the plane. I was not allowed to sit with my wife The vegetarian meal that was ordered at booking and confirmed 5 times at check in even by the airport manager was not loaded. Staff promised compensation but withdrew the offer after the flight had left and we were stranded. Every person we dealt with offered some form of assistance but no one actually did anything after we were out of their line of sight. Do not fly this airline.

MEL-AUH. Flight good service friendly and room to stretch as cabin was very empty. AUH-SYD. At the airport my passport is checked at check in - no problems. Passport control the passport is checked twice. I arrived at the gate 55 mins before flight departure to find a long queue. Before getting to the gate another passport and boarding card check for the name. Then the gate. We waited and waited and waited. Security also waited and waited. There are only two persons manning the gate for a full A340-600 flight to Sydney. I observed both counters. The First and Business counter was taking around 45 seconds to process a passenger. The economy counter was around 1 min 10 sec per pax. Finally I get to the gate counter 5 minutes before the scheduled departure. Again 1 minutes to process my boarding pass and no reason when I asked why they needed my passport. Tthere were 53 people behind me so I knew the departure would be late. Of course it was by 52 minutes. The flight was as good as it could be for an overnight flight with friendly staff and plenty of food.

Our dance team flew from New Zealand to Serbia and back. The staff were friendly and helpful. They even brought us a special dessert and a card to say good luck for the competition we were attending. On the return trip they gave us all a glass of champagne when we took off to celebrate our win at the competition. The food was delicious with great beverages as well. The movie range was large and the seats in economy were fine. We would thoroughly recommend flying with them again.

### Etihad Airways customer review
October 18 Seat 23H Flight EY461. Melbourne to Abu Dhabi. I suppose it is inevitable that comparisons will be made between this flight and the Emirates 777 economy service to Dubai. Having done both now I would say they are fairly level pegging apart from the fact that Etihad uses an A340 600 with a 2x4x2 configuration much preferable to Emirates 3x4x3 for couples. The A340 is very quiet and surprisingly comfortable even on a 14 hour leg. Clients wanting to stopover will prefer Dubai. While boarding was orderly and relaxed the experience was spoiled a little at check-in. I had booked through Virgin Australia using points and pay - and assumed travel on a major partner airline would be seamless. No such luck. First the check-in guy had to call Virgin - then the airport duty manager got involved and eventually phoned Abu Dhabi for approval. Meanwhile we went for a long walk - it was that or be stabbed in the back by the anxious horde waiting to be checked in. Finally all was fixed - but it took about 40 minutes. The welcoming crew were bright and chatty and flight EY461 left Melbourne on time. Note that the bins above the window seats are smaller than the centre aisle. Safety instructions are via animated video and crew demos. The entertainment screens are a good size and the touch system really easy and simple to use. Emirates ICE is also great but the touch controls don't always work all that well. About a half hour out hot paper towels were served and dinner started 40 minutes later. I had Moroccan beef casserole in couscous not the most appealing looking dish but quite tasty thanks mostly to the black olives. I was pleased to see Australian products were used. The meals are medium in size the other noteworthy point is that steel utensils are used. I had a glass of red wine and asked for another when the trays were taken but the bottle had gone. To her credit the hostess did fill my glass later. Breakfast was scrambled eggs with the lot - fine for me. To summarise: Apart from the hiccup at check-in smooth good value flying.

JIA 10/23 to Chicago on American Airlines. Then Etihad on 10/23 flight EY150 Chicago to Abu Dhabi. After seeing the pictures online and flying on what seemed like a lawn dart with AA I was so excited to fly on the Etihad Airways. However that quickly ended as soon as we landed in Chicago and had to get in another line to check in. A man met you before you even went through the line and placed your bag in the carry on stand to check if it fit. After seeing him give one lady a hard time with hers since the handle grazed the side I knew we were done. Sure enough all 4 carry ons we got on fine with AA were "overweight" and exceeded everything else they could possibly find wrong. So $700 later we had to pay for all 4. Absolutely no care about it and the guy needed a manager to override it. She even shook her head at the ridiculous fees but still did nothing. Although they present this put together and professional staff the unfriendly crew poor meals and lack of overhead complements as we saw a few quarrels over space it was anything but. I'd much prefer my laid back friendly JetBlue or Southwest staff any day. Needless to say we plan to travel extensively while living abroad in AD but will not use Etihad again.

When checking in early at Sydney airport we asked for the bassinet we had requested with the booking for my wife and young children. Unfortunately this couldn't be arranged for their connecting flight in Abu Dhabi. A little confused we asked how they could all be gone 14 hours before that flight. We were told they had been reserved. I understand that airlines have different bassinet policies and accept that. Over the next 2 hours we were told it was our fault for not buying another seat that they wouldn't have a look to see how full the 2nd flight was and they wouldn't speak to our travel agent who was trying to help us. Finally with my children distressed and my wife in tears she simply said she couldn't fly so we went home.

I travelled from Sydney via Abu Dhabi to Manchester my biggest problem the first leg to Abu Dhabi was with Virgin Australia I cannot understand why they will not issue a boarding pass for the two legs of the flight. The having to queue in Abu Dhabi for the boarding pass to Manchester was disgusting at a time when you would like to be relaxing after a 14 hour flight and looking around the airport instead you have to queue for a minimum of between 1 and 2 hours to get a boarding pass. The same on the way home had to do it all over again. The flights were very good cant complain about them but this can really turn you off flying with them again. I know they are two different airlines but flying together in unison surely this problem could be sorted out to the passengers convenience.

### Etihad Airways customer review
London to Bangkok staff very helpful found the seating very narrow and little space inside the seating and eating resting area. The film selection frankly was poor far too many children's films and poor content. The airline should review who is making the selection and look at other airlines (recommend Singapore). Food and wine good. Outgoing both aircraft had up to date equipment. The return journey Bangkok to Hub was an older type aircraft and equipment requires modernisation.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Oct 21 from New Delhi through Abu Dhabi to Washington Dulles on EY 131. It wasn't bad. There were two drawbacks. One was the long line in Abu Dhabi when transiting to India. The other is the strange rule about only one carry on. They sometimes enforce and sometimes don't but its also supposed to be under 7 kg which is unrealistic at the least. I had to put up a fight to get on the flight home with my camera and small carry on which weighed 10 kg.

Lisbon-Milan-Abu Dhabi-Sydney on 3 4 and 5th October first flight codeshare with TAP second flight crowded but nice flight very nice cabin crew tried to make flight more pleasant. Third leg Virgin Australia also in codeshare crowded also but very nice. Sydney-Abu Dhabi-Dublin-Lisbon 18-19 October also a very crowded first leg plenty of food and drinks ice creams. Second leg during the night half full flight could move seats to sleep the crew organized for all passengers to have plenty of space to sleep. Last leg codeshare with Air Lingus horrible and late. Overall a very good service will fly Etihad again.

### Etihad Airways customer review
We travelled first class Sydney to Paris via Abu Dhabi and return in September/October. We had 2 previous experiences with Etihad on this same flight both in Business Class. The first time in 2009 was excellent. Service meals attention to detail was second to none. The second trip was a little less so less attentive the calibre of meals had deteriorated somewhat and service was definitely in decline. So this time we thought we would go First Class. Such a disappointment. From the check in at Sydney Airport - where apart from not being in a queue we could have been anyone for the level of attention and reception received. Thank heavens for the Express Passes to get us quickly through customs and immigration. The cabins in First were excellent the flat beds long and as comfortable as you could get and the beds were made up with sheets. Cabin crew were efficient but certainly lacked the warmth of previous flights. The chefs advised that they could prepare anything for us where in fact the meals were very ordinary and unimaginative. It also took a long time to be served. I know they were striving for a 'dining experience' but when you are tired and hungry you don't want to wait nearly 4 hours as we did on our flight home. I also don't want to hear how tired the staff are how busy they are or any other excuses as we did on several flights. I think we have given Etihad every chance to prove themselves but we may not fly with them again.

9 Oct EY20 10 Oct EY441. 19 Oct EY440 20 Oct EY11. Flew LHR to Abu Dhabi and on to Vietnam: and then return. Found staff uncaring: food disappointing: seats uncomfortable: everything very grubby. Return flight had to wait almost 3 hours at transfer desk before they would issue my boarding pass. When I asked for a drink at midnight on return flight one attendant asked the other 'do we have anything open'? I only wanted water or perhaps orange juice!

Sydney to Abu Dhabi and then to Athens and back from Istanbul to Sydney in September and October this year. We were lucky enough to gain upgrades for the two longer legs and this made the flight more enjoyable. As all the previous writer indicate there certainly is a step up with Business class and while I could not justify paying the full price the chance to upgrade sections is worthwhile. The space is the major gain you have what seems the equivalent of 3 seats you can stretch out have places which to store books glasses and water bottles and certainly the amenity kit is worthwhile. The service also improves with a higher staff ratio and they were certainly attentive to all needs from extra blankets to late night snacks (I can recommend the steak sandwich). The food which while not that much better than economy is presented in a more sophisticated way and taken with the space makes dinning an enjoyable experience. Would I recommend the upgrade yes for the longer legs 12-14 hours for the shorter ones 4-6 hours you can survive!

### Etihad Airways customer review
Abu Dhabi - Jakarta. I was offered an online upgrade for which I bid $500. Didn't find out until I checked in that I had been successful. It was definitely worth every penny. Super-fast boarding very comfortable lie-flat seat/bed excellent choice of food and drinks from a very extensive menu with great presentation and very professional service. There were 4 cabin crew for approximately 15 passengers. The only negative: had to change seats as the TV remote control wasn't working. The aircraft was an older 777. Very good experience.

MAN-AUH-BKK return. Excellent punctual flights. Pick up by chauffeur at each end was much appreciated and transit in AUH was seamless. Food on board was wide in terms of variety but of very high quality. Cabin crew were most attentive and professional.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Purchased a return trip flying first class from Melbourne to London in Sept/Oct 2013. Flight to London was excellent - could not fault. However when arriving at airport for return flight - return ticket no longer worked? Etihad claimed it was American Airlines fault and they needed to sort it and therefore they did nothing to assist me. AA are their sister airlines but are at another terminal at Heathrow - Etihad would not assistance in sorting out problem - obviously could not be bothered. Now flying with Singapore but have to wait another 10 hours. Thank you for your lack of assistance Etihad - other airlines are far more helpful.

Flew BNE-AUH-DUB return BC in September and found the service on board excellent both ways. The food was terrific and the only point in the whole journey that let the airline down was the inflight entertainment. It was rubbish for such a long haul flight movies were very old TV shows were showing reruns.

### Etihad Airways customer review
EY22 Manchester to Abu Dhabi EY622 Abu Dhabi to Mahe EY621 Mahe to Abu Dhabi EY15 Abu Dhabi to Manchester. We decided to try Etihad rather than fly with Emirates. What a mistake. There is no leg room if you are tall. When the person in front put their seats back it was most uncomfortable and the staff only begrudgingly asked them to put them upright when the meal was being served. The food was not very good. There was no clean up of the toilets during a 7.5 hour flight. There was no way you could walk around as if you went to the rear of the plane the staff frowned if you went into their space. The films on offer were not very good. The Etihad flight from the Seychelles was an hour late and we came into gate 35 then had to rush to transit at gate 1 and then rush to gate 36 for our Manchester flight. All in all it was an experience that we will not be repeating.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Abu Dhabi (AUH) to London Heathrow (LHR). Etihad requires the passenger to check in at the airport at least 1.5 hrs before the flight. As you approach the airport the streets are filled with signs to guide you on where to go. When you reach workers with trolleys will be waiting for you to help with the luggage. While you're entering the terminal the security check is after the luggage check therefore it will be comfortable for the passenger to go through security without having to worry about the luggage. After the security check and when you are ready to board you will walk through a fairly small duty free which requires improvement. The shops were not organized and small and the food court is very small and does not have the variety that would make the passengers have a good experience at the airport. I boarded the Boeing 777 which was very large compared to the other airplanes I went on. There are two lines before you enter a line for economy class and the other for business and first class. The line for economy was much longer than the other line. I did not have to wait because my ticket was a business class ticket. The flight welcomed the passengers with smiles which was a great start. The passenger is guided to his seat and helped with placing his hand luggage. The seats were small as my expectations were higher for a highly priced ticket that cost 8130 AED. However as the plane took off and the passengers were allowed to move the seats it turned out to be very comfortable as the seats can turn into a bed. The service was very quick and I had access to food at all times during the flight. Overall it was a great flight that I recommend for all.

Flew EY878 (AUH-NRT) on 24 Sept. A332. Had to bus from the terminal to the jet. Managed to get a paid upgrade to Business. Seat seemed to be narrow But was great when flat. Service was outstanding from boarding to disembarkation. IFE in Business was the same as in Economy. I expected more from the amenity kit. I would pay for an upgrade again.

### Etihad Airways customer review
I flew on EY20 (LHR AUH) on 23 Sept. B777 in economy. The flight was empty so we were all able to spread ourselves out. The cabin service was quick and friendly. Drinks flowed and the food was actually really good for economy. IFE seemed limited but acceptable for a short flight. One crew member seemed to be new and a little lost but I'm sure she will be on top of her game after a couple flights. Leg room was fine but seat width across the shoulders may have been uncomfortable if the flight had been full. I will fly again.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Travelled SYD-AUH-LHR and back. Firstly the pros the service and entertainment were great. Food and drinks (water) kept coming. Washroom was clean all the way that's pretty good for 21-22 hours. But the reason I may not travel again on Etihad on a long haul flight are the seats very uncomfortable I am not very tall so leg room was adequate but the seats were very hard and not at all good for my back. The armrest on all flights did not have the cushion part sewn on it it was just hard. For long haul flight all passengers whether first class or economy require a certain degree of comfort which was sorely lacking on Etihad. I am not anti-Etihad perhaps for a trip to NZ I would travel on it again but never again for a trip to Europe.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Flew from Manchester on 21 September to Abu Dhabi with Etihad had very mixed expectations as I had flown last year with Emirates who were very poor. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised as the flight and the staff were outstanding - nothing was too much trouble. Having said how good our flight was we now had high expectations of our connecting flight to Colombo - how very disappointed we were. Badly organized didn't check seat belts left our meal tray for 45 mins after everyone was finished - not sure what they were doing. We only had to wait 20 mins for them to answer our calls and then 10 more mins to bring the wine.

Flew out on 21st Aug BNE-SIN-AUH-ATH. Returned 14th Sep EY470 LHR-AUH-SIN-BNE. This was not the cheapest carrier. Sets are too small for majority of those around 6 ft. I saw at least 7 passengers with their knees jammed in seats and one tall woman in tears. Meals were ordinary and drinks adequate - most staff do their best once on board and the cabin manager was great. Most disturbing thing is the stop and re-board at AUH. Main terminal is a disorganised mess - toilets are inadequate. Bussed to plane air conditioning useless and by the time you get to aircraft you are seething.

Flew from AUH to MAN. No check in at Abu Dhabi as was transit passenger from another airline. Was bussed from remote stand for a long ride unimpressed with the airport itself and long security lines. Seat assignment pre- booked honoured. Full flight to Manchester AVOD was decent but could be better. Found cabin crew polite professional though the male staff seemed professional. Food was good with full hot breakfast before arrival. All in all a good flight which pleasantly surprised me.

Flew from D.C to Chennai. Things were not good at Abu Dhabi the terminal and Gate to India was over crowded and no place to even stand. The arrival time to Chennai was 1.5 hrs delayed and we lost our connecting domestic flight. On the way back the seats were not assigned properly they canceled our selected seats. In a four seat row for a family of four we were given three seats and we had to travel with a toddler for a 15 hr flight from Abu Dhabi to D.C. The seats are not that great either they are narrow and not much leg space. Only good thing is the flight crew.

### Etihad Airways customer review
After booking my tickets I advised customer services of my disabled needs. When I arrived at the airport this information was not on my booking and so I had to explain again my disabilities and needs at the check in desk. On arrival into AUH the plane was parked on a remote stand. after the plane has disembarked I had to wait a further 20 mins for ground crew to bring the lift to get me off! I was taken straight to the connecting gate as normal. At the gate I had to identify myself to the staff who had no history of my needs and I had to stop a ground staff and request my own assistance to board the flight via the lift. I boarded nearly last which meant jostling . Again no specific instructions in case of an emergency were given - it is usual to be informed what the crew will do for me to get me off in an emergency. I have before have I been treated with less dignity or support.

Flew Business class LHR-AUH-PVG. Great service on the first leg the Business class lounge at Heathrow was superb. Excellent selection and very comfy. The boarding was a little chaotic but once onboard excellent flight. Wine selection was wonderful as was the food selection. Transfer very easy. Next leg was in First. I was the only person in First and what an experience. Food was of restaurant quality having my own chef literally. The wine and champagne again was of tip top standard. As nobody else was on board I had my own dining booth and my own sleeping booth. Managed a full 7 hours uninterrupted sleep. Breakfast again was superb.

I've flown Etihad more than 20 times within the last 9 months. On my most recent flight last Tuesday I had the same great service as usual. The cabin crew were very open and friendly. Even if I couldn't sleep on the two flights the crew were offering drinks and food during the night time. Food was good as usual as well as the entertainment system. I love flying with this airline and can recommend it to everyone. Compared to others the seat comfort is good and I had plenty of leg space.

Abu Dhabi - Kuala Lumpur - Abu Dhabi. B777-300 3x4x3 economy class. Very slow check in at Abu Dhabi airport flight delayed for 5.5 hours without prior notification and also without a word of apology. Return flight on time. I have commented before on seating comfort on those flights after 7 hours you feel the impact of hard seats in your limbs. Food quality and services very good both legs so is the inflight system.

Traveled with my wife from Abu Dhabi to Sydney in June. Seats were so close together it was impossible to stretch legs in any way easily the worst we have encountered. Cabin service was almost non existent and food was well below average. Etihad ground staff in Abu Dhabi were rude and very unprofessional. We will never consider Etihad for any future flights.

### Etihad Airways customer review
13-16 Sep 2013 EY421 Abu Dhabi to Dublin EY 42 Dublin to Abu Dhabi. My two flights can only be described as the worst flying experiences I have had to date. Aircraft was an old A330 with a "brown" interior and the tightest long haul seating configuration I can recall. Service on board varied from dated to simply rude and unhelpful. Special meals booked in advance did not arrive and no alternates offered. However all of this was minor in comparison to the purser on the return leg who was rude to the point of being intimidating. Inflight entertainment system was old but would have been better if it had actually functioned. Recommend you eat well before the flight and take a book for entertainment if you have to travel with this airline.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Moscow - Abu Dhabi - Bangkok. A good trip although check in staff member seemed not to speak English. Flight was a little late leaving Moscow and arriving in Abu Dhabi which made the transit a little stressful as it was not clear that I and my luggage would make the second flight. Cabin staff were friendly and attentive but no one spoke Russian on the Moscow - Abu Dhabi sector. Food and wine were good but the service a little slow especially on the Abu Dhabi sector where I was trying to get a reasonable amount of sleep. Both planes were good and clean and with seats being fully flat beds were restful and spacious. The IFE was good on both planes and we were permitted to use the IFE until we had landed. The airport in Abu Dhabi was undergoing extension/renovation and a bus was used to transport passengers to the terminal. The lateness in arrival meant that the plane was about to board so it was not possible to eat in the lounge and then only sleep on the second flight. Here supper rather than dinner was late being served so valuable sleep time was lost. Bag did make the second flight but it was one of the last off the plane in Bangkok so received zero priority!

26th June was going to Washington from Lahore. Lahore - Abu Dhabi was fine Abu Dhabi - Washington was good though seats were small there was no room to stretch legs on such a long flight of 15 hours. Flight was on time. The staff were friendly from Abu Dhabi to Washington. Service was really good but the food was pathetic on both flights. Staff were bad coming from Washington to Abu Dhabi. They weren't listening to bells and were taking too much long to bring even water. Overall it was a good experience.

I flew from Manchester UK to Bangkok via Abu Dhabi on 18/19 Aug 2013. Worst flight I have had since I travelled Kenya airlines in the eighties! From Manchester seating was very uncomfortable.

Flew from Manchester to Bangkok through Abu Dhabi. Everything was excellent from the chauffeur service to the Spa in the business lounge in Abu Dhabi. I have flown with many of the worlds airlines in business class this was far superior. The food was excellent the seat / bed was extremely comfy the staff and service could not have been faulted. I am flying again to Sydney at the end of October and am looking forward to the trip as the flight can be part of your holiday rather than just the drag at the beginning and end. I would highly recommend Etihad as farms I am in Club world layering the year to LA and know its going to be a let down in comparison.

Very disappointed seats in economy uncomfortable very little leg room worse when the passenger in front reclines their seat. On our flight FA forgot to serve meal to our row almost 3 hours and only provided with a small cup of water during this time (a 14 hour flight). Service was poor on all 4 flights on journey to UK from Sydney. On one of the legs of this travel FA advised they had only vegetarian meals available on next leg of trip the inflight entertainment system failed on the majority of passengers. Generally not a good experience.

My Husband daughter (20 mths) and I recently flew to Dublin via Abu Dhabi from Sydney on August 2nd 2013. It was the worst flight we have ever encountered! Our seats were very uncomfortable very little leg room! We had to request a safety belt for my daughter just before takeoff as we were taxing down the runway! No cabin staff checked if I was familiar with the procedure of applying this belt or indeed if I had applied it correctly . Only infant food available no alternative offered despite requesting alternative toddler food. My Toddler had no food except what I brought onboard. Cabin staff were rude and definitely not child friendly! Hot food was just put down despite having a toddler on my knees! Inflight entertainment was very poor. My flight from Abu Dhabi to Dublin improved in terms of more efficient customer focused cabin staff but otherwise very disappointing overall experience.

FRA-AUH-CMB on 27 July. First the flight was delayed from 11.15-15.00. Then told that we would get a new connection FRA-AUH-DOH-CMB. Spent more than 11 hours waiting in Abu Dhabi. They couldn't book us on the Doha flight as our baggage was lost. They booked us on a Male flight. In Frankfurt they promised us a hotel room in Abu Dhabi - it wasn't the case. Baggage arrived 2 days later. It was the worst flight we have had and will never fly again with them.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Booked a return flight from Australia to England. I was on crutches and informed the airline that my surgeon had requested that I needed to keep my foot elevated during the flight. The airline assured me that there would be no problems and that I would be able to sit in the baby section which had more leg room. When we arrived at the airport and checked in I found out that I did not have the extra leg room. I got on the plane and spent the next 14 hours with my leg up on the food table which was extremely uncomfortable. While on the plane the hostess also had to take away my crutches so they were out of the way of other passengers. At other times within the flight I pressed my buzzer to call the flight attendant over and I was completely ignored. This was the worst experience I have encountered.

My wife and I travelled to Frankfurt in early June with a wonderful 2 day stopover at the Jumeirah Hotel in the Etihad Towers Abu Dhabi. The service comfort and overall experience was better than other first class airlines including Emirates Qantas and British Airways. I would recommend Etihad to any first class traveller. Our return flights in late August 2013 were just as memorable as was the 3 day stay in the Etihad Towers.

### Etihad Airways customer review
As a regular Etihad flyer (UK - Australia return every 3/4 months) I have to say the service quality is slipping below an acceptable standard. All their efforts are spent on their first or business clients so if you are going economy you can only expect the bare minimum of customer care and comfort. The entertainment system is very good but lost baggage seat comfort pre-assigning seats and being able to easily contact a helpful customer service when things do not go to plan are also part of the service I consider myself to be paying for and Etihad do not deliver on these points. Also they code share with airlines that are well below Etihad's standard its very disappointing to believe you are paying extra for a good airline only to find you've been code shared onto a second rate partner airline.

Milan-Abu Dhabi-Kuala Lumpur and return. A330/200 from Milan to Abu Dhabi and return and B777/300 for the other legs. Aircraft's in good condition and clean cabin crew very polite and friendly food and IFE good. In general I'm satisfied of this my first experience with Etihad. The only thing they must improve is the 32" legroom: for intercontinental flights is a bit cramped and it's hard to sleep.

### Etihad Airways customer review
TXL-DUS-AUH-HYD first leg with Air Berlin DUS-AUH-HYD with Etihad. Both Etihad flights were excellent comparable service to Qatar and Emirates really. FA's extremely courteous and attentive for both legs excellent IFE and seemingly very well executed landings. Only gripe is the rather inefficient process of attaining boarding passes due to the code share with Air Berlin. At first Air Berlin staff informed me something was strange about my booking and they could only check me in as far as Dusseldorf after making me wait 15 minutes they then told me they could check me in as far as Abu Dhabi. Upon arrival in Abu Dhabi had to line up again to get my boarding pass for onward flight to Hyderabad. Surely it should be possible to check passengers and their luggage through to the final destination from the point of first departure. I didn't understand the logic in that. Overall only added an extra 30-45 minutes of effort to overall flight experience though so not that bad. Would definitely recommend Etihad to anyone considering it.

Return flight from London - Abu Dhabi - Nairobi. The seat allocation was badly managed for flight from Nairobi to Abu Dhabi. Vegetarian food was requested at the time of booking. Instead leftovers were offered. Throughout the flights they had no record of me requesting a vegetarian menu. Cabin staff service was very slow. On one instance while food and drinks were being served it seems I was ignored and finally when I requested coffee it took a very long time to arrive and this also after a reminder.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Switzerland to Singapore. Compared with Singapore Airlines it is cheaper for almost same seat and space comfort in the cabin. The service is great maybe less cabin crew but still great as they do their best for you. They are strict with safety food is good but compared to other airlines is more simple bread not so good. The down side for me was entertainment disappointed. On way back got opportunity for cheap business upgrade. Great business class. Good value for money. Great food very good service with nice crew. Seat perfect and flat. Downside again entertainment. The other downside is Abu Dhabi airport one of the most boring international hub airports I've transited. Not much too do lack of good seats. Very few opportunities to sleep. Small airport hotel always fully booked.

### Etihad Airways customer review
Melbourne to London. All in all decent experience. Crew were excellent on both legs especially considering that the Abu Dhabi leg was completely full. Good entertainment system and food not bad. The major drawback is the seat pitch. Seats themselves fine but when they're crammed it affects the whole experience. Might make me consider another carrier in the future for that reason.

### Etihad Airways customer review
The seats in Pearl Business Class are unusually narrow and short as others have written. I weigh 173lbs (78kg) and am 170cm tall. The foot enclave is so narrow that I could not comfortably place both feet together. I had to sleep with one knee bent the entire time. There is simply no way an overweight or tall passenger would be able to squeeze into this seat. The IFE system is very poor in variety and choice and Etihad Airways forces their passengers to watch a 90-120 second commercial (that cannot be skipped) before every program. This is very irritating. On both fights the electrical outlet did not work and I lost battery power on my iPad before the end of each flight. Every seat on the return flight in Business Class was full and the air temperature in the cabin was at least 75 degrees (24 Celsius). My wife and I were perspiring during the entire 9 hour flight and were unable to sleep due to the hot cabin. The food was surprisingly bad. I ordered the “grass-fed fillet of beef” and my wife chose the mushroom lasagne. I returned the beef after the first bite. The mushroom lasagne was mediocre and my wife couldn't finish it. For the entire 9 hour trip we subsisted on mixed nuts and Diet Pepsi. The quality and variety of the food are considerably better on many other lower cost business class flights.

Paris to Abu Dhabi - July 3 2013 and back on July 27 2013. Flying with Jet Airways from Paris to India we had a stop to Abu Dhabi so that the long flight was endorsed by Etihad partnership. Such a great company in economy class! We were well placed close to the window great seat comfort plane quite new great stewards service. My headphone wasn't working and the hostess gave me a new one within 5 mins with apologies. Good food and good vegetarian food. Good choice of entertainment. Flight was quiet. Cabin was not cold at all and we were glad for such good comfort.

A great flight experience that can get you from to Dublin to Abu Dhabi in 7 hours 20 minutes. A great deal and the seats were pretty comfortable. Staff were sometimes annoying but good overall. However like many airlines I don't like the food but the beverages were good. I would rather starve yet hydrate. The best part was the entertainment. There were lots of movies and games and the headphones were quite comfortable. The plane I was in had new AC power ports that would activate about 2 to 3 hours into the flight and switch off just before landing. All in all it was a great experience.

Chicago to Hyderabad via Abu Dhabi. My carry-on was not allowed at Chicago they claimed it was bigger than the allowed size. I took the same suitcase many times on Emirates and American Airlines and was never questioned. My option given was to check-in with $65 fee. Surprisingly I saw people board with bigger suitcases than mine. Food and entertainment is good however air hostesses are a bit rude.

Complaint about Air Berlin (Etihad's partner) Phuket-Manchester. Etihad in my opinion is very close to being a premium airline but are being seriously let down by Air Berlin who are absolutely a Budget Airline in every sense. Today (6th August) we sat in the plane on the tarmac for 2 hours at Abu Dhabi. It appeared that Air Berlin had over booked the plane. Some passengers had the same seat ticket and had to be let off. The food on Air Berlin is a joke. I had pre-ordered a vegetarian meal however there were none and the stewardess said the main meal (omelette and sausage) - I could eat that and just eat around the sausage. She then said the vegetarian option was really only for children and I could have that. It was a 'crepe' with a slice of peach. Hours old and disgusting. The food on the Etihad flight was excellent. The drinks on the Air Berlin leg were all lo-cost type drinks. The entertainment system on Air Berlin is rubbish. I absolutely will not fly with Air Berlin again and I will be complaining directly to Etihad that they are being seriously let down by their partner in this leg. I do not expect to pay a premium price for a budget airline which makes up half the leg (The Phuket to Abu Dhabi leg).

For the flight it was very good MAD-CDG-AUH-SYD Business return. Pity that Abu Dhabi lounge was lacking as was the staff in general. Certainly too small for flight numbers and waiting for one person to serve drinks was laughable. Would certainly never ever take a flight out of Paris again but assume that was either the handling agents or AF on the first leg/last return leg. Not enough planes as the delay on the way back due to another incoming that made another 300 people late was silly.

March 2013 MAN-AUH-DEL in Economy Class. While Manchester Airport staff handled things very well and Flight Attendants were very good on Manchester to Abu Dhabi segment things deteriorate once you reach Abu Dhabi Airport to catch flight to India. Extremely crowded. When boarding started for my flight to Delhi there was a staff member to selectively snatch Carry-on Luggage. They say that space is limited and you will get it at Delhi Airport. When I boarded I saw people with even bigger carry-on luggage then mine. At Delhi told my bag would be with on Luggage Belt. On return from Delhi again staff were taking carry on bags. I saw many people returning their Special Meal when it comes to our choice choices were very limited and many has run out. Between Delhi-Abu Dhabi I found staff a bit rude. Full marks to Manchester Airport to Abu Dhabi flight crew and also the staff managing Abu Dhabi Airport to Manchester flight. Unless they sort out this fiasco about carry-on bags between Delhi to Abu Dhabi I will avoid travelling with Etihad. Food is good and they give complimentary drinks.

BKK-AUH-DUS MUC-AUH-SYD in business. Connecting in AUH can be a nightmare plane departed late but no communication. The seats are hard not really comfortable the service not as good as the computation is food and beverages are acceptable but honestly nothing to write home about. An overpriced product not to be recommended.

Flew AUH-GVA A333. The Business class product is very good and consistent from the Etihad chauffeur that picks you up at the hotel to the hard product onboard. Very good seats good choice of meals and attentive cabin crew. Only downside is the Business class lounge at AUH T3 which is a bit small.

For some reason First Class is not always available on the Abu Dhabi to Athens leg and so after travelling FC from MEL I had to use the Business Class Lounge. Fine - except for the fact that there was not enough room for everyone to sit down. After a long trip this is not amusing. Perhaps this lounge should be enlarged as everything else about the lounge is more than adequate. Why is it that there is no sign (a green light something!) to indicate that the toilets are empty? This would appear to be a fairly standard design detail. Very inconvenient. I have travelled on FC and BC on Etihad and am satisfied. However the real test of an airline is how it treats its Economy Class passengers. I will be checking out these comments.

Very disappointing flight (DUB-AUH-SYD) recently. Etihad have been steadily getting poorer and this is it for us. No seat assignment on booking to the AUH-SYD (14 hour) leg. Phoned Etihad office in Dublin on several occasions who agreed to file seat request on our behalf. Online check in - no option to choose seats. Check-in in Dublin could not issue boarding passes for 2nd leg. Hour long queue in Abu Dhabi to find in 2 random B seats in the cabin for me and my wife! Give me a break. If I book same flight with VA I can assign seats for both carriers. and that is exactly what I will be doing in the future.

Myself my Partner and 8 year old son have just flown from Auckland to Manchester return the legs from Sydney being with Etihad. They are certainly the EasyJet/Jetstar of long haul travel and know how to cram as many seats and few toilets into their planes especially the A330s. Having said that for the price it was good being $2000NZD cheaper for the 3 of us than the similar route with Emirates and to the UK with other airlines. The flights were good times and on time the staff were friendly and our vegetarian and child's meals were fine. I would use them again if the price was right.
