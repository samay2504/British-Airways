### "last time flying with Super Air Jet"
Not Verified |  Had no choice but to fly with Super Air Jet as it was the only remaining flight that day. Scheduled for 18:10, the flight didn’t take off until 21:00 — a three-hour delay with no proper explanation or real compensation, just a pack of biscuits passed off as an in-flight meal. Lion Group’s "punctuality" strikes again. This was my first — and definitely last time flying with Super Air Jet. I won’t be using any Lion Group airlines in the future.

### "ended up missing my flight"
I had a frustrating and disappointing experience with Super Air Jet. My flight was delayed, and when I asked the agent twice, he told me it would be delayed by an hour. Since I don’t speak the language, I relied on the screen for updates, but unfortunately, the screen never reflected any changes, and I ended up missing my flight. The situation got worse when I tried to get help. The staff informed me that they could rebook me, but the next available flight wasn’t for another five days. They refused to offer a refund and directed me to contact the third-party provider I booked my ticket with (Capital One). As a result of missing my flight, I had to spend additional money on new accommodations and buy a new flight with another airline. I spent over three hours with customer service trying to find a resolution, but there was no solution in sight. I would not recommend Super Air Jet based on this experience, as their communication, customer service, and problem resolution were all severely lacking.

### “very bad ticketing management”
Not Verified | Have a very bad ticketing management. Super Air Jet always pushes the ticket sales beyond its limit, and on the day of flight, we were being cancelled without prior announcement. The schedule was rescheduled three times, with total delay time of 4 hours.

### "This is very poor service"
Change of schedule for IU 747 at 17.15 to IU 747 at 18.30 without any info & confirmation, because flight IU 747 was still there at 17.15 so it looked like there were passengers being shifted to the next flight. Not because of the delay. When leaving from Jakarta to Denpasar there was a delay of around 45 minutes. The flight from Denpasar to Surabaya that I ordered for you also experienced a delay from 17.20 to 18.00. Of 3 flights, all were not on time. This is very poor service. Perubahan jadwal IU 747 pukul 17.15 menjadi IU 747 pukul 18.30 tanpa info & konfirmasi, krn flight IU 747 tetap ada pukul 17.15 shg terkesan seperti ada penggeseran penumpang ke penerbangam berikutnya. Bukan krn delay. Saat berangkat dr jakarta ke Denpasar jg delay sekitar 45 mnt. Penerbangan denpasar ke surabaya yg sy pesan u kel jg mengalami delay dr 17.20 menjadi 18.00. Dr 3 x penerbangan semua tdk tepat wkt. Ini pelayanan yg sangat kurang bagus

### "a bit stupid of your system"
This is my first time flying a super air jet airline. Initially, it was written at E6 without confirmation of moving to E4. And the flight delay information was only announced at 16:27 WIB, it was on the ticket at 15:55 WIB, already boarding. I don't know what your management is like. Information via email or WA/SMS is possible if there is a delay. Honestly, this is a bit stupid of your system. Ini baru pertama kali nya lagi saya naik maskapi super air jet. Awal nya yang di tulis di E6 tanpa konfirmasi pindah ke E4 Dan pesawat delay baru di info di 16:27 wib itu di tiket nya jam 15:55 wib sudah boarding Saya gak tahu management kalian kayak apa. Info lewat email atau WA/SMS kan bisa kalau ada delay. Ini jujur agak tolooolll system kalian.

### "No concern for customer experience"
The flight was scheduled to leave Lombok at 5:35 PM. We were in the air closer to 8 PM. Fortunately the latest renovation of the Lombok airport is quite comfortable and a few quality restaurants and coffee shops to wait. We were a family of 5. After arrival in Jakarta and arrival at the jetway, we walked down to get on a bus. After a wait of over 5 minutes, the bus arrived. Then we toured the airport and arrived at another gate after a 10 minute bus tour. Finally we go to baggage claim. The baggage arrived over 1 hour after we deplaned. There was NO Super Air Jet staff at the baggage carousel. Security did not know the status but stated the same issue happened the night before. Super Air Jet is an airline with terrible management. No concern for customer experiences, no concern to communicate to travelers updates of the flights. Our family said this is our last flight on Super Air Jet. It's amazing the management is so weak and so bad they cannot manage. However, on a positive note, the flight attendants were excellent and the pilots gave us the softest landing I've experienced from many flights.

### "they're not helpful"
I initially book a flight for 10 AM, but they cancelled it without any reason and changed it to 2 PM. I have tried to reach out for the customer services for information, but they're not helpful. As I waited for my 2 PM flight in the airport, they delayed it to 2:25.

### "change in their baggage policy"
We bought the ticket thru Traveloka. Apparently there is a change in their baggage policy and they only allow suitcase (they do not allow any boxes, stereo form, or wooden). There is no posted sign at the airport, there is no posted sign anywhere when I fly 5 days ago with them. The charges is not small. It is almost the same price as the ticket price IDR 44.000 x 19.7 kg = IDR 866.800. I argued that there is no announcement when I booked with traveloka. I told them they should have send a whatapp or email to all the passengers after the booking. I usually fly with Super Air Jet before and this will be the last one.

### "One of the worst airlines"
One of the worst airlines I’ve ever come across. We were late so we booked another flight with the same airline but they didn’t inform us about the delayed time that was 4 hours during our booking and we missed our flight from indigo which was from Jakarta to Bangalore,. We did inform them about our urgency to reach Jakarta as we had another flight. Their carelessness costed us a lot of money and I hope no one ever chooses this airlines ever again.

### " Service very very bad"
Not Verified |  After 4.5 delay no notification, not inform, I miss my connecting flight to Istanbul. Service very very bad. Communication zero. Service to passenger about delay zero. Responsibility to passenger after 4.5 delay zero and no food no water.

### "never had such a bad service"
Not Verified | We had a flight from Bali to Jakarta IU 731. Plane had technical difficulties. We are waiting already 3 hours. No information or drinks anything. I never had such a bad service.

### "worst airline I’ve ever dealt with"
Not Verified | This was the worst airline I’ve ever dealt with. I had a flight booked for 8:30 AM, but at the last minute, it was changed to 7:30 AM without any prior notice. On top of that, the terminal was incorrectly listed, and I ended up missing the flight. The airline staff rudely told me there were no available flights for the rest of the day, leaving me no choice but to purchase a ticket from another airline. I wasted more than 4 hours and had to cancel the activities I had planned. They completely ruined the trip I had been so excited about, and I am currently seeking compensation for the damages caused.

### "I don't recommend it"
Not Verified | Super Air Jet delayed our flight 3 times, which they then cancelled. We then went to Transnusa which doesn't even have a card machine, they want cash only. Now we're stuck here in Jakarta, waiting for a different flight. We had to take the sky train to a different Terminal. Never use these 2 airlines, I don't recommend it.

### "delayed for more than 4 hours"
Return flight 21-24 Aug 2024 CGK to DPS Well, it's budget airlines anyway. It's just the first time I got delayed for more than 4 hours. Depart CGK-DPS oat Aug 21st was acceptable, less than 30 min. It's budget airlines anyway. Return sched at 24th Aug was fro 21.00-0050. At least, they compensate with food and money (Rp300rb, $19) But for a business trip to Bali, I have to blacklisted the flight, unless it's the last choice (either the only flight or running out of money.

### "The worst airline"
Not Verified |   The worst airline i’ve ever flew. I bought ticket flight for 14:30pm with code flight IU 745, the actual flight was 00:30am. If you do not have capability to manage or professionalism to run your business, please do not make a lot of people lost of their time or ruin others plan.

### "never use Super Air Jet again"
My flight is at 8pm. There was no further notification that there would be a delay. No joke, 2 hour delay. My prediction is to arrive at Soetta airport at 10 pm at the latest. Because the new plane departed from Bali at 10 pm for unknown reasons, I was late arriving at Soetta airport where I had to continue my journey to Bogor using the Damri bus. Arriving at the Damri bus pool at 23.45, the buses to Bogor had already run out. There is no compensation from Super Air Jet. I will never use Super Air Jet again. Thank you Super Air Jet for a very disappointing experience! Penerbangan saya jam 8 malam. Tidak ada pemberitahuan lebih lanjut bahwa akan ada delay. Tidak main-main delay 2 jam. Prediksi saya sampai bandara Soetta jam 10 malam paling lambat. Karena pesawat baru berangkat dari Bali jam 10 malam dengan alasan tidak jelas, saya terlambat sampai di bandara Soetta yang mana saya harus meneruskan perjalanan ke Bogor menggunakan bus Damri. Sampai pool bus Damri jam 23.45, bus ke Bogor sudah habis. Tidak ada kompensasi  dari Super Air Jet. Saya tidak akan pernah pakai maskapai Super Air Jet lagi. Terima kasih Super Air Jet untuk pengalaman yang sangat mengecewakan! !

### "Flight reschedule and delay"
Flight reschedule and delay. Information counter shows wrong departure hall. Despite delay, Information board shows flight on time Only one pathetic announcement with no confirmation on delay time.

### "by far the worst airline"
Today our flight was delayed 1 hour 30 minutes. Myself and my girlfriend were then stuck in jakarta with no help from any of the staff, they didn’t care and now still here try to figure out €3000 to get home. I have never experienced anything like this before. This is by far the worst airline. we emailed but don’t think we will get a reply as I mentioned the staff didn’t care one single bit.

### “never use this company”
Not Verified | J'avais réservé un vol le 21/08. Dans un premier temps, il a été annulé et on nous a mis sur un vol beaucoup trop tard. Je m'en suis aperçue en vérifiant ma réservation. J'ai pu Booker le vol de 20h. Le jour J, le vol a été retardé de 2h sans explications; ce qui n'était pas possible pour nous car nous avions un autre vol à Jakarta pour rentrer en France. Je suis allée de suite au comptoir et ils nous ont trouvé 2 places sur une autre compagnie . Heureusement ! Il y avait 5 espagnols dans le même cas que nous, leur vol de 18h avait été annulé et ils allaient raté leur correspondance. Nous avons rencontré 2 français dont le vol avait également été annulé. Je dirai juste une chose: ne jamais prendre cette compagnie!!! C'est une honte! À fuir!!! - I had booked a flight on 08/21. At first it was canceled and we were put on a flight way too late. I noticed this when checking my reservation. I was able to book the 8 p.m. flight. On the big day, the flight was delayed by 2 hours without explanation; which was not possible for us because we had another flight in Jakarta to return to France. I immediately went to the counter and they found us 2 places on another company. Fortunately! There were 5 Spaniards in the same situation as us, their 6 p.m. flight had been canceled and they were going to miss their connection. We met 2 French people whose flight had also been cancelled. I will just say one thing: never use this company!!! It's a shame! To flee!! !

### "a terrible airline"
The airline cancelled my outbound flight and I had to wait 4 hours for the next one to leave. On the return flight they brought forward my flight and didn't give me the option to change my schedule because there were no seats left. They always have cancellations or schedule changes, it's a terrible airline. La aerolínea me ha cancelado el vuelo de ida y tuve que esperar 4 horas a que salga el siguiente. A la vuelta me ha adelantado el vuelo y no me ha dado la opción de cambiar de horario ya que no quedaban sitios. Siempre tienen cancelaciones o cambios de horario es una malísima aerolínea.

### "worst airline I've ever flown with"
Not Verified |  On 11/08/24 the plane was delayed for two hours, no one was told why. This caused me to miss my connecting flight in Jakarta. Then the replacement flight in Jakarta was delayed for two hours from the time it was supposed to take off, again no one was told why. Today 19/08/24 the flight from Bali to Jakarta is delayed for two hours, no one will say why. This is going to cause me to miss my connecting flight in Jakarta, unless of course it's also delayed. I wouldn't wish this airline on my worst enemy, please never book flights with Super Air Jet. There's bad and then there's these guys, congratulations Super Air Jet you're the worst airline I've ever flown with.

### "delayed without being given certainty"
The plane was delayed without being given certainty when it would fly, the employees when we asked were not friendly, the gate to the plane was not guarded, many passengers had already gone down the stairs carrying their very heavy luggage. Then told to go up again, it turned out to be the wrong gate. When we had boarded, we were still held and could not board the plane. It is highly not recommended to use this plane. Very different from when this plane first operated, it was always on time

### "rules are silly and illogical"
On Super Air Jet flight number IU 733 on August 4, 2024, from Denpasar to Jakarta, I was prohibited from bringing a box containing dry food into the cabin during boarding, even though the box size did not exceed the regulations. The reason given by the staff was company policy. I thought, this airline has ridiculous rules. But then, I saw a box already placed in the overhead compartment inside the cabin. Super Air Jet is quite okay, but if their rules are silly and illogical, it's better to choose another airline. There are still many others.

### "they changed the departure time"
Not Verified |   We flew from Jakarta to Denpasar. When we arrived in Jakarta we could not find our flight first. The reason was that they changed the departure time from 18:00 to 18:45 without any information. Then, 10 minutes prior boarding, they announced a delay of 60 minutes and changed the gate. After we went there we waited and no announcements were done. Someone came and told everyone to be fast and come to the gate the flight initially should depart. Two days before we wanted to fly back home we got a message on whatsapp about our flight - in Indonesian. After we translated it we found out that our flight got rescheduled from 12:20 to 17:30. No alternative offers. There was neither information about the reason of the change of departure time nor could we reach the hotline on phone, whatsapp or email.

### "10 are delayed flights"
Not Verified |   The aircraft is not bad, the check in online is easy. From 13x flights with Super Air Jet, 10 are delayed flights. What score i should to give it?

### "Not recommended"
2 times use this flight, Denpasar - Jakarta and previously Jakarta - Denpasar. Both flight have unknown delay (no Clear information from ground staff), have almost same delay time, 2 hours plus. Not recommended.

### "last flight with this airline"
My flight moved from 13.20 o'clock to 14.50 O'clock, and after waiting it still got delayed for more than 20 minutes. It Will be my last flight with this airline.

### "Never flying with you guys again"
I flew to Kuala Lumpur from Surabaya on 15th June and the flight got delayed by two hours. On my way back to Surabaya on the 18th June, the flight got delayed again by an hour to 17.50. Because of that, me and my family wanted to eat first since we arrived early and decided to go order food at a restaurant. No announcements, at around 17:10, the status of the aircraft is already on the final call, forcing us to leave our orders with an empty stomach. Thanks, Super Air Jet! Never flying with you guys again.

### "almost every flight is delayed"
Flight was supposed to start at 3:15 p.m. but we didn't leave until 5:40 p.m. Had an important flight back to Istanbul at 9pm in Jakarta because we almost missed it. Because of the delay I had to spend extra money of 25 euros. Attention tourists should know that this airline is very bad and almost every flight is delayed! Flug sollte um 15:15 starten jedoch sind wir erst um 17:40 losgeflogen. Hatten in Jakarta einen wichtigen Rückflug um 21 Uhr nach Istanbul, denn wir fast verpasst haben. Wegen der Verspätung musste ich extra Geld ausgeben in Höhe von 25 Euro. Aufgepasst Touristen sollten wissen, dass diese Fluggesellschaft sehr schlecht ist und fast jeder Flug sich verspätet!

### "This is the worst airline"
Flight was supposed to be at 20:30 and finally we are boarding at 00:30. When checked in flight immediately changed to 21:30. So at the end they said we are late "only" 3 hours. When people asked (me included), what will be done and what would be the compensation, the answer from the attendant was (you should be happy, you got the compensation, that was the box of JFC (java fried chicken) that has been given to you. the box contained a small portion of rice and a chicken wing. This is the worst airline i have been flying with, please go to learn how to do business and take care customers.

### “aircraft was in good condition“
Don't listen to all the bad reviews, my flight was on time, the aircraft was in good conditions, departure and lending also very pleasant. Enough space for legs and luggages.

### "don't ever fly with them"
Worst experience with worst Indonesian airline. 2h 45 minutes delayed at arrival. No explanation. We are sorry". I missed my flight to Paris due to late arrival at checkin counter. Thank you so much Super Air Jet. My advice, don't ever fly with them.

### "My backpack had been opened"
Upon arrival in Jakarta, my backpack arrived late at baggage claim. All the other passengers already left. My backpack was not in it’s cover as I put it. Also the airplan bag with lock was lying under my backpack. The zipper had been opened in the wrong way. My backpack had been opened.

### "contents had been completely ravaged"
Not Verified |   Upon collecting my bag at the Arrivals Area, I noticed that a thick protective plastic film had been added to my bag. Having never flown with Super Air Jet before, I thought this was a courtesy item which had been added to protect my bag. When I arrived at my hotel and removed the film to find that my bag and some of its contents had been completely ravaged and burnt at some point whilst in their care. I immediately emailed the airline, who declined to take accountability and argued that ‘it could’ve happened in the taxi’. How? I was then told to go back to Lombok Airport and complain to the Airport staff, so I did. I was directed to the Super Air Jet office, where their staff essentially dismissed my claim and lied to my face. It’s a gross failure of the airline that no internal reports have been raised for the extensive damage caused to my bag. The airport was insistent that was entitled to receive a Property Irregularity Report form which I would need to claim on my insurance. They refused to hand it over and placed security either side of me to try and intimidate me. The manager even left the room to let less senior members of staff deal with me and the airport staff. I’ve tried contacting them so many times and poured hours in trying to get this sorted but they’re not even replying anymore. I advise anyone considering flying with Super Air Jet to reconsider, and to look at the damage in the photos attached.

### “Delayed for 3 hours”
Delayed flight for 3 hours without clear information from the start, waited on the airplane for an hour. I don't recommend using this airline for any urgent flights.

### "never travel with this company again"
The flight was delayed two hours, because they cancelled several flights and joined the passengers in on flight. I had to pick another flight in Jakarta to return to my country, and I was going to lose because of the delay of their flight. When I asked the company for explanations, they told me that they assume no responsibility, and the cost of any inconvenience is just mine. So, if you dont want to expend hours and hours at the airport or loose you flight, don't choose this company, no matter the price of the flight. In the end it doesn't worth it and the can ruin you your travel. I’ll never travel with this company again.

### "very nice staff"
I was very scared of the very bad reviews for the airline and of flying with a low cost airline in Asia. No plane malfunctions, plane seemed in good state, captain good, and delay of only 30 minutes. Also, very nice staff, helpful to handle fragile baggage and helpful on the aircraft.

### "lucky if you will fly same day"
This airline has multiple flight times per day and then they cancel half of them and put all day passengers in one plane. You are lucky if you will fly same day. They change boarding gate often, the screen information is not accurate so you always need to be on super standby. Also they told the flight was cancelled because Padang airport was closed, but we checked arrival flights on multiple flight radar pages and Garuda, City Link and Air Asia was landing fine. They not provide hotel, so we ended up losing our Mentawai boat following morning, hotel in Padang and Sipura. This cost us over 1000$ and they will not cover anything. You have much better chances of your flight happening with any of the other airlines. This is not this one flight of Super Air Jet that made me write review but already got fed up.

### "a very good experience"
Not Verified | I flew with Super Air Jet in January from Jakarta to Lombok and returned with them in February. Overall, I had a very good experience although the outward flight was about an hour delayed with no explanation. The crew were extremely friendly, and the cabin was perfectly acceptable for economy class. I did notice on the departures board, that many of their flights were cancelled though. This was quite alarming on the outward journey as we had a taxi waiting in Lombok and a boat to take us to the Gili islands. However, despite the hour delay we made it. I probably wouldn't risk flying with them again because of the many cancellations I noticed. But, my experience with them was very good.

### "The worst service ever!"
The worst service ever! I booked a ticket first, then I purchased add-in KG. So the email came separately. Afterward, the flight was canceled. And they said they will refund my extra KG fees. They will take 5 days to refund. I didn’t even agree to do that by any action or reply. Afterward, they shifted me to next flight without any extra KGs. I have no other extra money for sudden purchasing extra KG as I am student. Then, their refund also taking 5 days, which gradually led me in shameful situation when I checked in for the new scheduled flight by then. I tried to reduce some and my luggage became 22 Kg. I explained the staff in charge at counter that I am cancelled from the original flight and the refund is still in process while i have no extra preparation. this is only 2 kg extra. I am very inconvenient with the situation. I would never ever fly again with the disappointing airline.

### \"behaved very unprofessional"
Flight delayed for 2 h, sat 5,5 hours on the plane without any drinks. In KL they also take your drinks right before boarding. So totally with immigration and time before boarding, maybe 7 hours no water. I asked for water as I needed to take medicine, I offered to buy. they gave me a glass of water. They do not have any kind of drinks or food on board. Not for free and not for sale. Flight delayed for 2 hours. We had to wait on board. They just casualy said sorry, we will be late, as we wait for another flight to arrive. The staff was really friendly, but they behaved very unprofessional. They were very merry, laughed a lot and had a lot of fun amongst themselves. that is really nice, but not on a flight. Also because they they were so loud, laughing loud, chatting, I could not use the time to sleep. The only advantage was they did not even weight the luggage. But the check in was also chaotic. I went from check in to the gates, but was stopped and sent back by the airport staff, saying I was to late to reach the gate. I had to get a airline staff they aid. So I ran back to check in, they were really relaxed and sent me to another counter. Where I met other relaxed staff who walked me to the airport staff. I ran for my life to the gate, just to wait 2 hours without food or water. I mean they could have said at check in I need to hurry, as the gate is far away. They could also have said we will depart late, so I could get some food.

### "the worst experience of my life"
That was the worst experience of my life. Random changing schedule, cancellation of flight without any notifications or explanation. Beware of this company if you have flight connections! We had flight from Jakarta to Bali and our flight was scheduled at 10 AM, they gave boarding pass for 10:15, and in the end we departed at 10:45. Without any notifications about delays! On the way back from Bali we had the same flight connection with Jakarta. But on check in they said that our flight was cancelled and they can offer us other flight for an hour later. But it was impossible because we had flight connection and very tight in time. After explaining all this in quite tough form, they suddenly found places in flight which departing in 20 min. We were running to gate, but in the end we have seen that aircraft had a lot of not occupied places. I will never use this company anymore! This is catastrophic service and relation to clients

### "had a good experience"
We had an early morning flight (5:50am), departed on time, arrived on time. Decent flight, seats are basic but good amount of legroom. There was an app for onboard WiFi/entertainment on your mobile but we couldn’t get it to work. Staff were friendly, some of the in flight announcements were not repeated in English. No in flight refreshments were provided or available to purchase. As a no frills airline comparable to Ryanair, was decent. We may have had a good experience as it was such an early flight though.

### "poor excuse of an airline"
Horrible. Never flying this poor excuse of an airline again. Rebranding doesn’t change that they are under Lion Air who aren’t capable of running an airline. Always delayed (usually more than an hour, now over 2hrs) no info given to passengers either. Better to spend a little more and fly with Citilink.

### "both flights got delayed"
The perfect example of “you pay peanuts, you get monkey.” Cheap ticket, but flight is almost always delayed. Used this airline twice and both flights got delayed. Today was the worst one with scheduled at 14.30 and delayed until 18.00. I’d rather fly Air Asia or Citilink next time.

### "flight was perfect in timing"
A lot of problems before the flight (cancellations, rescheduling, etc), but finally the flight was perfect in timing, services, assistance. After buy, check your flight info periodically on the website to avoid surprises.

### "twice got rescheduled."
Twice buy this ticket, twice got rescheduled. Got WhatsApp late night before flight. Without any number call center, responses by WhatsApp's robot. Worst airline.

### "All flights canceled and postponed"
Sadly unaware of their incompetence I booked a number of domestic flights with them…if there was one I was able to take as booked! All flights canceled and postponed to other times which promptly led to delay!! An odyssey! Purtroppo ignara della loro incompetenza ho prenotato una serie di voli interni con loro…ce ne fosse stato uno che abbia potuto prendere come da prenotazione!! Tutti i voli cancellati e rimandati ad altri orari che puntualmente hanno portato ritardo!! Un’odissea! !

### "bad overall experience"
Delay and delay again! When will they learn to be on time? Good cabin service will not make up for the bad overall experience - rushed to the airport to be on time and yet, delayed twice with no reason (and no compensation) and just told us to wait.

### "Every day the flight had a delay"
Not Verified |  No one could inform us about the flight how late or anything. Checked the time of these flights when they would departure. Every day the flight had a delay of more then 1 hour sometimes even 3 hours. Also the board said we needed to go to a different gate then the ticket. Asked people around and every time they gave a different answer.

### "choose another airline"
Not Verified |  I can't recommend the Airline at all! I booked a flight with them via Booking.com for the 8.10 at 11:15 am and the day before  at 11:30 PM Booking informed me that the flight was cancelled! So less then 12 hours before the flight start and also late at night the flight was cancelled. No support or any information from Super air Jet at all. Also when i requested a refund afterwards they are not responding to any of my mails, so please avoid the unnecessary stress and choose another airline.

### "An unhappy customer"
Super Air Jet is a pretty new airline. As a foreign traveller I had to face their inexperience. The english website collapsed constantly, especially when I tried to cancel my flight in time. After many hours of trying I had to give up. The next day my friend tried it on the Indonesian website of the company and there it worked. But it was too late, I missed the deadline. Still I was guaranteed 10 percent of the base fare. 60 days have passed and I've not received even a penny. In times of Covid 19, it should be possible to cancel the flight online. I would definitely not recommend to use that airline. Unless they do some big changes on their online performance. An unhappy customer

### "Totally unreliable"
They just canceled my flight 8 hours before departure and put me in a flight 4 hours before normal departure. I was by complete chance at the airport quite early to be able to fly. Totally unreliable and did not give any refund or reason for cancelation. Booked via Trip.com and they also did not help at all.

### "two times out of two I was bumped off"
Second time booked on this airline and second time I got re-booked on a different airline (of the same group) with a different departure time. For this flight I was booked on a late afternoon flight and 18 hours before they changed my booking into a flight leaving five hours earlier. A bit of a nuisance, but such things often happen with domestic flights in Indonesia. Ten minutes before departure the plane was nowhere to be seen, so surely there would be a delay, which eventually was announced. Strangely I received simultaneously a phone call from their mother company, Lion Air, informing the Super Air Jet flight was cancelled and me being re-booked on a Lion Air flight leaving in 30 mins. Officially the original Super Air Jet was not cancelled, and I presented myself at the gate asking for information, telling about the phone call I had received. The gate agent told me I was was right and I would receive a new boarding card. Others were standing at the gate and overheard the conversation and asked the agent why they were not informed, not to mention re-booked or to receive the same service. No answers given to the others and indeed I received five minutes later a new printed boarding pass for my Lion Air flight. I was the only one offered this. Interesting was that the Lion Air flight was 2/3 booked. Upon arrival in Jakarta I checked on my original Super Air Jet flight and saw it left Lombok one hour after Lion Air left. Don’t know what triggered this whole thing, also because the original flight to be taken wasn’t overbooked. On the other hand I was grateful for the re-booking. The conclusion of me flying with Super Air Jet is I would love to write a report about them, if one day they give me the opportunity to effectively fly with them and they don’t re-book: two times out of two I was bumped off.

### "gets high praise from me"
Jakarta Soekarno-Hatta (CGK) to Yogyakarta (YIA). I was attracted by their advertisement, marketing themselves as a "millennial airline" offering a "millennial experience" - and sure enough, this new low-cost carrier spinoff of Lion Air has already impressed me right from the start. The ground staff handling transit passengers were very proactive and quick to assist me and my family so that we can transfer from terminal 2E to 1A without having to exit the terminal building. Boarding was conducted 20 minutes behind schedule - and when I stepped into the plane, the fear of this flight getting delayed was swept away by the very energetic, proactive, and friendly cabin crews. Never had I encountered a cabin crew so proactive in assisting me in opening the A/C vents until this "super crew" came. That attitude was maintained throughout the flight. We took off 1 hour behind schedule - which is not their fault, and soon after, I got the privilege to try their Wi-Fi-based in-flight entertainment. There were, sadly, no music selections, but they covered that up with never-seen-before contents such as podcasts, vlogs, e-magazines, etc. The seat, still retained from Indigo, was comfortable with slightly more extra legroom due to the slim design. The landing was, obviously, behind schedule, but overall, I do think that this new airline surpassed my expectations and they managed to step up their game, as a low-cost carrier. My only critique is that the flight attendants of this flight used an excessive amount of PA announcements - it could have been made more efficient. Super Air Jet gets high praise from me.
