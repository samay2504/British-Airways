### “Thanks for nothing, Sunwing”
Spent over a year saving up for a “dream vacation” with the family, courtesy of Sunwing/WestJet. What did we get? A 4-star fantasy—if the fantasy is a run-down resort with broken toilets, busted showers, dead phones, and food that could double as punishment. Sunwing’s solution? A generous $200 voucher per person! All I have to do is save for another year or two, spend thousands more with them, and maybe get sent to a slightly different dump next time. Wow—how thoughtful! Their website says they’re a “Canadian-operated company dedicated to delivering frictionless, unique and memorable vacation experiences.” Oh, it was memorable. Frictionless? Only because nothing worked. Thanks for nothing, Sunwing. You’ve mastered the art of turning disappointment into a business model. And then, there was the flight home—a sad joke. The plane looked like it was straight out of 1975 Russia, with filthy, patched seats, almost no legroom, and zero comfort. The lack of soundproofing made the flight deafening, adding to an already miserable experience.

### "an absolute nightmare"
Our experience was an absolute nightmare and their customer service and support is absolutely abhorrent. Our original flight was scheduled for March 1st, 2025 at 4:45PM We arrived at the airport by shuttle at 2:30PM It took over 45 minutes to simply get through baggage check. It took another 45 minutes to get through the boarding pass and security queues. We then waited in the gate area for over an hour, and boarded the plane at 5:30PM. As a person with MS, this was very difficult and taxing on my body. Once boarded, we sat on the plane for 3 1/2 hours. We were given very few basic updates about simple "delays" A small half cup of warm water was provided ONCE during that entire time frame. At 9:00pm we were told that the flight was cancelled and accommodations would be made. It took another half an hour for everyone to be de-boarded and brought back to the gate. From 10:00 PM until 11:45 PM the passengers were left outside the airport in the humid 25 degree heat with no water and no update of any kind from any staff. We also had zero ability to communicate with anyone unless we paid for wifi, as the 3 hour free wifi had expired long before hand. ALL other airlines had busses ready and waiting for passengers the moment they left the airport. Once busses finally started to arrive at 12:00 AM, We were told we would be going to the Dream resort 1 hour away. The flight the next morning was scheduled for 11:00 AM we drove until 12:30 AM when the bus over heated and broke down. Once we were back on the road, our bus stopped at 2 different resorts with no passengers getting off the bus. The driver had to get out and talk to someone or on his phone for long periods of time. It wasn't until 2:00 AM that our driver finally arrived at the resort we were told we would be going to. It then took another half an hour to get checked in and finally get some rest. The rescheduled departure (at 11:00 AM March 2nd, 2025) was then rescheduled again to 8:00 PM. We left the resort at 3:30 PM by shuttle, drove 1.5 hours back to the airport and arrived at 5:00 PM. The self check kiosk would not accept passports because information was incorrectly entered by the staff when they rescheduled the flight. Because of this, we had to wait from 5:10 PM until 7:40 PM before we could even check our bags. We got to the gate at 8:00 PM, and it wasn't until 8:45 PM that we finally boarded. (45 minutes after set departure time) We then waited on the plane until 10:00 PM before we actually left the tarmac. The flight getting cancelled was not the issue, It happens. It was all the other delays, lack of planning, lack of information, and lack of proper care for the passengers, and the attitude and care from the company. The 11 hours on March 1st and the 7 hours the following day were absolutely unnecessary and regardless of the plane cancellation, it was exempted from the APPR as a basic cancellation which is nonsense. The rest of the nightmare should be taken into consideration.

### "they change the return flight home"
Not Verified | This airline is the absolute worst when it comes to reliability. We booked a package and 6 days before they change the return flight home 6 hours earlier which ultimately makes us lose our last day in Mexico. When questioned about it they keep just saying it’s allowed in our terms and conditions. We paid for the late flight home and now we have the early flight.. when asked why they say no idea and no information was given. Now that the trip is non refundable they just say unfortunately you have to deal with it. Tell me how that is not false advertising? And tell me how this is a acceptable practice.

### "Extremely awful, slow service"
Not Verified |  Extremely awful, slow service, hourly waits, and no internet. These people hold us up about their 'microphone' and then say they resolved it 3 hours later when they just keep adding 20 minutes to their issues. I can't believe flying with them when I know I could've been on my vacation already but I'm still dealing with their problems.

### "2 days of vacation gone"
I booked a vacation for my family of 4 (myself, husband, 2 young kids age 7 and 10). My flight was scheduled for July 27 @16:45 - 1st Delay to 21:45 that same day (5 hours later) due to staffing issues - 2nd Delay to 08:00 on July 28 (one day later) due to technical/safety issues. Although I can appreciate that the second delay was due to safety, the first delay was due to staffing issues which is unacceptable and within the control of Sunwing. We spent over 5 hours at the airport just waiting with one delay after another. To make matters worse: - After we were offloaded from the unsafe flight, we were required to wait for our luggage which took over an hour - After retrieving our luggage we were required to wait in line for another 1.5 hours in order to get a taxi voucher. By the time we got home, it was almost 1am. - We were required to be back to the airport the following morning by 4:30 am (per their employees). This meant that we got 3 hours of sleep (at most) and this is how our "Wonderful" vacation was to start - We finally got on the flight the following day and upon arrival at the hotel at around 3pm, we were advised that they could not find our room booking. This was strange since I would have expected Sunwing to have advised the hotel of this delay since we purchased a vacation PACKAGE. But it appears that we did not have rooms. It was another 2 hours until we were situated in rooms. As you can tell from the above, our first (but really second day of vacation) was a complete write-off. We were sleep deprived, tired, stressed and in foul moods. Keeping in mind that we went through all of this with 2 young children. We were so exhausted by the time we were in our rooms, that we just slept. That is 2 days of vacation gone. After all of this, Sunwing's response was: Sorry, nothing can be done for you. Had the flight not been delayed in the first place due to lack of staff, we would have found out at 4pm that there were issues and things would never have been as awful as they were. They DO NOT take responsibility for their issues at all. USE ANY OTHER AIRLINE!! !

### “One staff was very rude”
Not Verified | One staff on the airplane was very rude towards my son, I don’t know if I should be angry about the staff that was rude or the HR for allowing and employing these sort of personnels. A little context of the situation that incurred we were sitting two rows back of the plane and the last row both sides left and right totalling 6 seats were empty, my son asked if he could use one row to rest and the staff replied THIS IS MY SEAT. A few hours in the flight my son noticed that the seats were still empty so he decided to go and use them. In which the staff angrily came to my son and started shouting at him and commanding him to get out of her seat. Which my son did however this did not stop and during the times she was using that row she was constantly fidgeting and kicking the seats in front of her where me and my family were sitting. The flight number was WG 7124. This staff was working from the back of the airplane with her other friend. I will be reaching back to SunWing to get an update on this matter.

### "our trip was amazing"
Not Verified |   Flew with Sunwing from Toronto to Sa nta Clara on March 23rd to April 13th. Brought an extra luggage to leave to the Cubans at the resort therefore it was only for one way. Was told there was a $90 dollar change but was changed $210, don't understand why. Other than that our trip was amazing. Have MS therefore have problem with stairs. Was provided with a Wheel chair and a lift to the plane. Booked with Sunwing to the same resort (Royalton Cayo Santa Maria) for October 15th for 3 weeks. Will be bringing an extra suitcase one way again. Hope I don't run into the same problem.

### "I would expect better behavior"
Not Verified |  On our return flight we were not given the option to select our seats. Normally this would not be a problem however my complaint is with the sunwing employees that were deadheading back to Vancouver. They selected all the window seats and aisle seats for themselves leaving multiple families separated including our family of 3. This is not something I would normally complain about however the callous nature of the sunwing employees was unacceptable. There was a mother and young daughter asking them to change seats and the young daughter was crying and the mother was begging them to change seats and they just flat out refused and claimed that they couldn't change seats because "they were working". They were not working, they were passengers. This is not just unacceptable as an airline employee, this is unacceptable as a human being to selfishly deny a mother and daughter to sit together just because they want to sit in the center seat. I was sitting in a center seat and I was sitting next to a sunwing pilot that took the window seat and also refused to move. He continually got up to go to the cockpit and chat with his friends over 6 times in a 6 hour flight but refused to sit in an aisle seat. He also had a huge amount of stuff with him including a full size pillow multiple containers and bags that kept falling on my lap and didn't even use the window as he had it blocked with his pillow. He was simply a rude and selfish man. I would expect better behavior from a stranger let alone an employee of the airline

### "airline to avoid in the future"
Not Verified | The seats were very comfortable but less than optimal legroom period. The flight from YYC to Punta Cana was OK, we had seat front pockets to put our tablets, earbuds, whatever. On the flight back there was nothing. Nowhere to put anything. And you’re stuffed in like sardines. Once we arrived in Punta Cana and had retrieved our luggage then what? Where do we go? Where is the Sunwing rep who is supposed to meet us and direct us to our hotel transportation? Absolutely nobody around. With our limited Spanish we asked numerous other airline reps where the Sunwing rep was - or even a desk or something. Nothing. Very unprofessional Sunwing. Just a note, our flight was on time, not early, nor late. No Sunwing rep. So where the heck do we find our hotel transport? Some other airline rep approached us and asked what we were looking for. He graciously took us directly to our transport bus. Otherwise, not sure how we could have found it ourselves. Zero inflight entertainment. If we hadn’t have downloaded some movies we would have been twiddling our thumbs for 6.5 hours. Communication is key in the customer service sector. Huge fail. Very unprofessional Sunwing, where were your greeters that we were told would be there for us? I sure know which airline to avoid in the future!

### "So disappointed in the service"
Not Verified |   I had a medical emergency while in Cuba and Sunwing was 200$ more than air transit and Air Canada when they found out those 2 airlines were full. They were not on time and the seats were so hard. There was no food but pretzels. When we landed we had to take a 10 minute bus ride to the terminal. Then wait an hour for our luggage. So disappointed in the service. Westjet used to be so good.

### "abruptly ripped our boarding passes"
The issue arose on the last day of our trip during the check-in for our return flight. Our seats, initially assigned to row 13, were unexpectedly reassigned to row 28 without any prior notice or explanation. Despite our efforts to resolve the matter with a supervisor, it was revealed that someone had paid for our seats, resulting in our displacement. What right do SunWing have to sell our seats? I argued that I wanted to buy my seats back or I should get compensation for selling my seats. The situation escalated further when an agent abruptly ripped our boarding passes. After I was able to de-escalate the situation since other family members were involved, our boarding passes were reprinted. To our shock, upon reaching the airport security checkpoint, we were surrounded by police who informed us that we would not be allowed on the plane. The reason given to other family members was that SunWing had overbooked the flight, a fact was unknown to us until our return to Canada. Upon seeking clarification from SunWing agents, the agents refused to engage with us. Another unnamed agent accused us of posing a safety threat to an international flight, threatening to involve the police and even mentioning potential imprisonment, invoking the specter of terrorism. Attempts to record the conversation were met with threats of arrest. In the end, we were forced to rebook our flights by ourselves for the following day. The subsequent travel with WestJet was uneventful, emphasizing that the issues were specific to our interactions with SunWing. This experience was deeply traumatizing for my family and me. Selling our seats to make extra profit at the expense of compromising the comfort and safety of my family is unacceptable. Having a group of agents controlling who boards the flight is not only unacceptable but must be dealt with immediately. We have been traveling for many years with no concerns, as a Canadian, I shouldn't feel like a criminal in a foreign country, especially by agents representing a privately owned Canadian company.

### "Never travelling with them again"
Not Verified |  Service is way below satisfactory. Purchased several vacation packages with Sunwing before. Flights were substantially delayed numerous times and we didn't receive any reimbursement or even prior notification. Last vacation the description of the hotel didn't match the reality, a 4 star hotel room that didn't have room to place one single cot. Never travelling with them again.

### "Absolutely useless customer service"
Not Verified |  Absolutely useless customer service. The worst customer service experience on the phone line. No wonder the company is failing and bought by competitor. My departure time was supposed to be 10.45am on Sept 11th, 2023. I got an email around 16 hours before scheduled departure time (around 3 pm, Sept 10th) and I was informed that my flight was delayed until 16.15 Sept 11th, 2023. I want to confirm the delay with Sunwing as Sunwing app and travelling website said my flight is on time. So I called Sunwing, then their phone line put me on an automatic feedback loop for half an hour with repeated similar options. After prolonged waiting, I finally got to talk to someone, that person immediately put me through the answering machine with a simple greeting "hello" or "hey". About another half hour, I finally got to talk to someone. However, that person was also not sure what's the departure time of my flight from system on their end. That person has to jump through multiple end to final confirm that flight is delayed. Meanwhile, Sunwing website and app still show my flight was on time.

### "I'm never buying anything from them again"
Not Verified |  When we got to the airport, they told us that the flight was delayed. I was only able to travel 2 days after. From the 7 days of holiday, I got only 5. Not an apology, a reimbursement or anything else for me losing 1/4 of my valued vacation. I'm never buying anything from them again, or would recommend this "company" to anyone.

### "Horrible flight home"
Horrible flight home, we were first delayed for 45 minutes on the tarmac in the plane, all passengers were on the plane since 10h30. The delay was caused by the sunwing staff because a little girl had a kink in her neck from the stress, lack of sleep, and air-conditioning in the hotel room the night before their return. The staff were trying very hard to disembark the whole family. The mother and a 9 to 11 year old girl were left behind in Cuba. Then despite my son's efforts to obtain some food and something to drink, without success, and rudely answered by the flight attendent. Ask someone on the plane to pay for it or you should have brought your own noodle soup, we don't take debit/credit cards or cash, only credit cards " not everyone has a credit card, and I know you can't pre-pay online with sunwing for food or drinks. So no lunch or drinks (soft drinks). We were then informed 30min before landing that we were going to be landing in Montréal Trudeau Airport instead of the Québec Jean Lessage Airport. We had to disembark, be shuttled to the airport standing (I am 75+ yrs old) then waited for over 1 hour to get our luggage. Then spent about 2 hours at secondary because my son was informing other passengers of their rights, and compensation for the diverted and delayed flight. The issue for the delayed flight was because the Quebec airport was closed since 09h30 that morning, we were informed on route at 15h00. Then was forced to run over a kilometer immediately following our passing through customs again for the 3rd time that day. My son had to run to advise them that we/I was going as fast as I could, took me over 5 minutes. Had my son not been there, I would have been left behind like the young girl and her mother. Our new flight from Montreal to Quebec was scheduled for 18h30, the plane took off at 20h45 from Montreal and only landed in Québec city Airport at 21h30. Finally got our luggage again at 22h30. We had to take a cab back to my sons house because we arrived too late for the ride we had planned. Now, we are trying to claim for our delays in arriving in the original destination, the Quebec airport site confirms that they were open for business as of 18h25 and yet only landed at 21h30 we were not off the plane for another 15 to 20 minutes. When I went on the Sunwing official site and tried to fill out the claim, I was met with a blocked page that would not allow me to complete my application because they are refusing to compensate anyone on this flight. Official ticket departure time from Cuba 11h10 arrival at Québec Jean Lessage Airport 15h00. Actual departure time 11h40, landed in Montreal at 15h40, re checked luggage at 18h00, flight scheduled for departure at 18h30, no time to eat despite having food vouchers, had to run to catch the plane then sat in the plane for about 2 hours before take off, and landed in Québec at 21h30, Québec city Airport was re-opened since before 18h30. If not for the full 6 and a half hours in delayed landing in Québec, but at least the 3 hours from Montreal to Quebec. They will not just wash their hands off with this. Don't let airlines get away with their pretexts and excuses.

### "no credit card = no food or drinks"
Worst airline I have ever been on. Can't pre-purchase food or drinks, no credit card = no food or drinks on board. On board staff are rude and arrogant (No credit cards, only have a debit/credit cards, "then bring your own food and soft drinks, not my problem" was their answer) On their site, ONLY CREDIT CARDS ACCEPTED is written in small fine print, unreadable unless you blow up the image to maximum and find it. Only airline that charge $25.00 for carry-ons of only 5kg not 10kg like every other airline. Delayed flight by over 6 and 1/2 hours, yet can not claim or even ask, stating on their site for out of their control pretext. Looking into the excuse/pretext, Quebec airport closed because of an accident at 9am and re-opened at 18h30 that same day. We were picked up at 11am but took off at 11h45 because they kicked off a 10yr old child and her mother and we trying to disembark the whole family because of a neck kink the children woke up with that morning. Then informed the passengers at 15h00 that the Quebec airport was closed and they had to land in Montréal Trudeau Airport. They disembarked everyone, gave us our luggage, had everyone running around to retrieve our luggage (1h plus wait) then go through Canada customs (almost 2hrs searches, nothing to declare or illegal, coming from Cuba). We then had to re-register all our luggage again after searching for an open Sunwing counter with a clerk (30+ min) and then run about 1 to 2 km the entire airport from one end to the other and back again. (U shape airport) plane tickets were scheduled for departure at 18h30, took off from Montreal at 20h45 to then land at our original destination landing at 21h30. Sunwing complaints site blocks all attempts to claim compensation for our delays that were supposedly out of their control, therefore they are not responsible in any way shape or form. BUT, after investigation noticed that the original destination was open for business as of 18h30 according to Québec City Airport website on August 1st 2023. That's 3hrs, obligatory compensation by the airline is being refused by Sunwing, complaints to the CTA are in order to force them to pay for this over 6 and 1/2 hours flight delays, if not for the 6 1/2hrs at least for the 3hrs delay from Montreal to Quebec. This airline has so many different problems and so many people attempting to make complaints, I say ATTEMPTING because the site keeps refusing to accept the complaint by erasing everything and saying that something went wrong and to try again, and again. That is a tactic they use to discourage anyone from going through with their complaints. I know that because I have been in this situation with Sunwing before, they will do and say anything so as not to pay for their delays, damaged luggage, etc. They do this because they know people don't have the time to waste writing the same thing 2, 3 or 4 times wasting 30min every time.

### "refusal to take responsibility"
I arrived at the hotel lobby at 6:50 a.m., expecting to catch the 7:00 a.m. pick-up bus arranged by Sunwing. The Sunwing staff at the hotel I stayed, aware of my flight departing at 11:20 a.m., assured me that the pick-up time was indeed 7:00 a.m. Unfortunately, the bus never showed up, which left me with no choice but to follow the hotel staff's advice and take a taxi to the airport around 9:30 a.m. This incident occurred on a Saturday morning, yet the hotel staff failed to appear even after 9:00 a.m. Upon returning home, I filed a claim for the taxi fare. However, the company representative disputed my claim more than four months later, asserting that their records indicated I was not present at 6:50 a.m. my hotel when the bus was supposed to arrive. According to the company's instructions, I was scheduled to be collected from my hotel 4 hours and 30 minutes prior to the departure time. Anyway, the distance between my hotel and the airport is 16 Km. Given that my husband and I were the only guests at the hotel, I suspect an error on their part, but it appears that the company is inclined to shift the blame onto the customer rather than acknowledging their own mistake. It's not surprising that the company consistently receives poor evaluations due to their refusal to take responsibility for their errors.

### "Absolutely awful"
Not Verified | Absolutely awful. Our flight was very delayed, our rep at our resort did not come to the resort at the times he was supposed to, and when he was here he was one of the most unpleasant humans I’ve ever spoken to. I hope nobody ever has to deal with our rep as their rep. Never choose Sunwing. Everyone else we spoke to who came to our resort on Sunwing had awful experiences too. Bad bad bad.

### "never recommend it to anyone"
Not Verified |  I booked our round trip flight me and my husband on may 11 2023, Toronto to Cancun. Our return trip was a huge surprise that they gave a seat beside other nice strangers and my husband was also was in another spot which is around five rows behind me with other nice strangers. Is this a joke. I tried to explain at the plane entrance to flight attendant this problem she promised to talk to someone but never did. Very bad customer service with no apology. They made a mistake at the cus service no big deal they don’t care about the customers. No entertainment at all, no screens. I rate your airline service as zero. Will never recommend it to anyone.

### "Very very bad service!"
People don’t book flights with Sunwing Airlines! I had a flight from Mexico to Toronto with a delay of 12 hours. My flight originally was booked for 14.30 but we left Mexico at 02.00am, arrived just in the morning, didn’t go to the work and didn’t receive any compensation! Very very bad service!

### "What a terrible airline"
Not Verified |  What a terrible airline Sunwing is. They are able to send a gate change through email but can’t notify you with a 5 hour delay? Now stuck at the airport for 7 hours after leaving the hotel. If you have all the patience in the world and you don’t value your time then look no further Sunwing is the airline for you.

### "delayed three times"
I’ve been travelling my whole life. This was the worst experience I’ve ever had our trip was delayed three times they offered a voucher which is useless because I would never fly with them again still waiting for $500 compensation from December 2022.

### "never fly this airline again"
Will never fly this airline again. Got stuck on the plane at the airport for an hour and a half because they lost a booklet and couldn't leave without it but still decided to proceed with boarding so all of us were stuck in our seats. The flight attendants were extremely rude and unprofessional, if I treated paying customers at my job the way the flight attendants treated me I would be fired immediately, I have no idea how that's allowed. Waste of my money, I get its a discount airline but I only saved $50 and my experience was 100 times worse than any other flight. There was way more wrong but unfortunately and I've reached out to the airline to resolve the issues but they didn't care and had no interest in resolving anything and their response was rude as well. I'm surprised the airline hasn't gone out of business if this is how they usually are towards everyone. I love flying and they made me never want to fly again

### "not be using this company again"
They delayed our flight 3 times and we waited at the airport for 8 hours before we could fly. We missed the whole first day of our trip. With no refund waiver that was applicable to us. As they said in the policy for flight delays for 3+ hours. It had nothing to do with any type of storm. Flight was also delayed 1hour on the way back and also waited 3 more hours for our luggage. In total of 12 in delays. Will not be using this company again. Nothing but problems after problems.

### "needed to cancel my booking and then rebook"
I made a mistake on the name of one of the tickets on the day booking. Upon noticing the error, I used the edit option on the website to correct the name. Fast forward to the day before my flight, turns out that the name change was not administered. In order to proceed with the trip, I had to call and have the name changed over the phone. Given the short notice, they needed to cancel my booking and then rebook. This cost me an additional $500 CAD + PER passenger. Each traveler was booked to each have their own room at the resort. Upon arriving at the resort, they put me and my travelling companion in the same apartment that offered two rooms. This was not clear and not at all what we were expecting. We wanted an apartment each. And there no drop down option for booking an 'apartment' when scheduling a trip. We asked for individual apartments at the venue, and we were told nothing could be done. Currently, I'm discussing these matters with Sunwing service via email, unfortunately, it's been 3 days since there initial message, no follow up.

### "It was the worst experience"
It was the worst experience, both ways our flight was delayed. From Toronto to Punta Cana, the flight was delayed for two hours due to the fact that there was no crew. Back from Punta Cana, the flight was also delayed for an hour. On the plane they sell instant noodles poured with boiling water for $10. The service is simply disgusting, sunwing is interested in is money, but they are not going to provide service. So, no comfortable seats, no food, even for small carry on bags we have to pay. The service after COVID just has gotten worse.

### "not recommend this airline"
Not Verified |  Both flights going to and from Orlando were delayed, to which the flight to Orlando didn’t give a notification till 2 hours prior to the planned departure time. Company proceeds to push back times with little to no reason. On top of this, upon arrival into a new country, my passport was lost. Every precaution to communicate with the airline was taken, in case it was found. After a 10 day holiday, no word was communicated. Leaving me to travel 10 hours round trip to an embassy to obtain a travel document. Just to arrive at the airport on departure date, and be told they have my passport. Rather than communicating this important information. The airline chose to hold and and assume I would show up with no passport, in search of mine. I am extremely disappointed in the lack of communication in regards to such important documents, not to mention the time wasted retrieving replacement documentation. Going forward I will not being using this airline or travel source again. Due to extremely pour communication , if that, from their staff. Not to mention the severely low staff they seem to have across all fronts. I would not recommend this airline to anyone, to avoid all these headaches.

### "subpar customer service"
Delays, delays, confusion, subpar customer service, more delays; 15$ food voucher. This situation ended up cutting our vacation by 2 days, costing us way extra in transportation and food without any refund or compensation. Sunwing unfortunately put a bit of a damper on our honeymoon travels.

### "never try this airline again"
On the way back to airport from resort they refused to take us to the airport and we had to pay from our own pocket. When we got to airport our Sunwing flight was delayed for 5 hours without letting us know. I had activated my flight alert for any changes but they still didn’t update us. When it comes to responsibilities they do not care who you are. Worst vacation we ever had and we never try this airline again that’s for sure.

### "Would never fly Sunwing again"
Sunwing is the worst Airline. I have ever traveled with even when you upgrade your seats and pay for it you are squashed in like a can of sardines. There's absolutely no service whatsoever. Would never fly Sunwing again. They even charge for soft drinks like a Pepsi or Coke

### "never book another trip with Sunwing"
Flight from Ottawa delayed over the hour and was to arrive in Cancun on Friday January 27 and Sunwing didn’t get us to the resort until Saturday morning 1am! Flight was delayed on the way back to Ottawa, arriving at 3:30 am Feb 4, and didn’t get our luggage until 8:30am 5 hours later well! Will never book another trip with Sunwing!

### "the most unreachable airline"
Tried to buy an extra bag via Sunwing website for upcoming trip and it hung me out to dry. Page crashed, spit me out as I paid but billed my credit card anyway. No extra bag voucher, no confirmation, no indication of successful purchase. Logged back in and tried to use 1-800 number in the baggage section provided only to get voice recording saying number was changed and I could pay $3.95 to be connected to directory assistance. I think I'm going to have a fight on my hands at check-in with reps who will undoubtedly be impotent to do anything. This is the most unreachable airline I have ever dealt with and I wish Westjet lots a luck when they buy this. Won't ever use Sunwing or Westjet again. Lack of accountability and difficulty reaching anyone to help is a pipe dream.

### "Plane was clean in both flights"
Flew YYZ-CUN and CUN-YYZ with Sunwing as a part of a work trip. The aircraft was a 16 year old Boeing 737 for both flights. (OK-TVY) YYZ-CUN: Couldn't check in online, so had to wait in line for around 45 minutes at YYZ. I was asked whether I wanted an aisle or a window seat. Boarding was fine. Pushback was around 15 minutes late, but we landed on time. We were served tea/coffee twice during the 4 hour flight. Not too much legroom, but not bad. CUN-YYZ: Also couldn't check in online. Waited for around 1 hour at CUN. I wasn't asked this time if I wanted an aisle or a window seat, and I was "randomly" given 32E (last row, middle seat). Pushed back on time, landed a couple of minutes early. Was served tea/coffee twice during the 3 hour 20 minute flight. My seat obviously didn't recline, but the legroom was enough. Plane was clean in both flights.

### "I would never ever use Sunwing again"
Not Verified |  Flight was delayed for 7 hours, instead of scheduled time at 17.05 on Jan 26, 2023 we flew at 24.20 (next day) on Jan 27, 2023. Pilot apologised for the delay and stated that company had to change aircraft and crew for technical reasons and that why it was delayed. During the flight there was absolutely no service and we were given water only after we asked! After arriving in Toronto we waited for 2 hours to get our luggage and announcement that they provided that they were scanning the luggage and didn't know how long it would take. We tried to submit a claim for the flight delay and the airline stated that it was due to the weather in Toronto, however there were other Sunwing flights which came from Toronto on time and left Cancun on time on the same date! So company lying without any hesitation, I would never ever use Sunwing again for any travel.

### "Lack of staff, pilots and planes"
Bad Communication: Sunwing did not inform passengers with the correct time of departure on its website, on its app or with its emails (more than a 6 hour difference). Lack of staff, pilots and planes : the airline did not have enough people or planes to run its routes, especially if circumstances were not optimal. This was the reason of so many delays. Other airlines, on the same routes did much better without huge delays (days). The airline gave false reasons for its delays to avoid paying passenger compensations, even when it was obvious what the true reasons were.

### "Information online hard to find"
Online booking not bad, we booked the day before departure the reservation didn’t transfer to the check-in system, so we couldn’t check-in online and possibly save some money on baggage fees, the Flight was on time, onboard service was fine, with a coupe of water runs during our 4.5 ish hour flight. Information online hard to find some important information, we had a total of 4 bags, first 2 were included for free, the other 2 were overweight and we knew we would have to pay for them, some other airlines would just charge overweight fees for the second bag and you can find the information on their website. Sunwing charged us the second bag fee of $90.00x2 for the overweight bags and then $115x2 for the same overweight bags, like I said we knew we had to pay, we possibly would of have made different plans if we could have found a more clear policy on baggage fees and how they are applied.

### "Misinformation or rather lack of it"
Not Verified |  Our flight back was delayed. We supposed to leave on the 17 of December from our hotel in Guardalavaca, but flight was delayed. The problem was that we didn’t know how long or if we are going to leave at all. We have to check out the hotel room at noon. So we waited in the lobby until 10 pm when the bus took us to the airport. Misinformation or rather lack of it was very frustrating. We left the hotel when we supposed to arrive in Toronto. We got to the airport and same thing: nobody knew when are we going to depart. We were luckier than others that didn’t make it home for Christmas. I’m not sure if I will ever fly with Sunwing after the horror stories I read.

### "we are never flying with Sunwing again"
Not Verified |  Given what other travelers suffered this same month, I suppose we didn't have it nearly as badly, it was just a bare bones airline that nickel & dimed you for everything from soda onboard to an added $25 fee per carry-on luggage. First, we paid $50 for upgraded seats which unless you are very tall don't bother. You don't get priority boarding as promised, they boarded people "with children or those who need more time first" and apparently more than half the plane thought this was them. At that point the rest of the passengers lined up to board. This is not how other airlines manage boarding, they use zones. The same thing happened on the return flight, so again, not worth the upgrade. There is no in-flight entertainment at all, we had to pay to upload movies onto our laptop, the food onboard is sparse and of low quality, it costs for even basic soda and drinks were pricier than Air Canada. Priority luggage is not a thing and I'm furious we paid for it: our luggage came off next to last and not together. The same thing happened on the way home. Our transfer from the hotel to the airport home never arrived, despite our hotel calling and texting them. We ended up paying 96USD for a cab and at the airport we heard the same situation happened for many other travellers who had to scramble and pay for their own rides. Sunwing didn't answer anyone who tried to reach out to inquire about where the transfers were and so far no one has responded to us about being refunded our cab fee. The airport was full of people who had no idea if their flights to get them were even coming and this is because Sunwing is not updating anyone, including the incoming airports. Even FlightAware wasn't updating, I had to go to the actual live radar app to find out if flights were coming, which means the airline itself has no clue where any of it's aircraft are. So many angry frustrated passengers and it made for complete chaos in the Cancun airport, especially since all of the Sunwing flights fly out of the tiny basement area and not the spacious main area up top. This is the second time I've flown with Sunwing and the last time they lost our luggage on a direct flight despite us getting to the airport 3 hrs early, We spent 24hrs without luggage. I don't care how much more it costs to use a competitor, we are never flying with Sunwing again.

### "Horrible customer service"
Not Verified |  They are more expensive than others, if you add all the hidden fees, the cost of your luggage and carryon. I paid extra for my seats. They charged me extra for my purse because it was 5 cm bigger than suggested personal item size in their website, with my hat in there. Horrible customer service. They told me that my 4 year old is not considered a child under sunwing policy. Unless your child is under 2, he/she is not a child. They call them non adult. also, if you have a bag or laptop that is even 1 cm more than 23 cm x 28 cm x 13 cm, get ready to pay for it.

### "We will never book Sunwing again"
Worst Airline Ever! I never write these but this is terrible. My recently widowed sister, her 4 kids, grandparents, my wife and I were supposed to take our First family trip. This company just ruined Christmas for these kids, then we rebooked for New Years and now 16 hrs before our new flight, Sunwing decided that SK doesn’t deserve vacations until Feb. We will never book Sunwing again! They will surely disappoint you and their customer service is beyond terrible. NO communication. Not trustworthy.

### "staff are rude and incompetent"
Not Verified | Worse airline ever! Avoid at all costs! The staff are rude and incompetent. We lost 2 days due to delays and lies that they fed us at the airport and they refuse to communicate with us ! I can’t believe how they are still in business after the last couple of weeks incidents .

### "Avoid at all costs"
Absolutely horrible experience with Sunwing: Pearson to Punta Cana for an All Inclusive vacation. Avoid at all costs, even if alternative airlines are more expensive. You will pay in other ways! The line-up at Pearson for baggage drop-off is 2+ hours (online check-in), absolutely no other kiosks had this amount of backlog. Frustrated customers. There are unnecessary checkpoints for "travel documents" which no other Canadian airline required. In Punta Cana there is an additional „checkpoint“ to pay US$20 Dominican exit tax: Again a massive line-up and delay (other airlines like WestJet include this tax in their fare, no waiting). As other customers noted, delays and carousel wait-times are unacceptable. 200+ people crammed around the YYZ carousel for over 2 hours. If you are elderly or traveling with kids avoid this airline at all costs.

### "Never recommend this airline"
Not Verified |  Very Disappointing. Never recommend this airline. We found out that our flight is delayed for 6.5 hours when we were dropping off our luggage at Toronto airport. Even the lady at reception said she just found out about delay. We decided to wait at the airport because we took a ride to airport. No alert or notifications were sent to us that the flight going to be delayed. Same thing happened on our return. We checked out of our resort and we’re ready to leave when I just checked online that flight is delayed for 4 hours. We have to wait in the resort lobby. We could have taken a good use of the day if we had received a notification of the delay few hours earlier. Do not travel with Sunwing.

### "Sunwing treats you like livestock"
Sunwing used to be good. Now they make you take a bus in Toronto to a terminal that is far. Both ways. When you arrive back in Toronto you have to wait an hour for bags. They only include water, coffee and tea for free. Soda you have to buy. They have tickets where you fly to different airports to pick up passengers. For our flight from Toronto to Cayo Coco we went to Santa Clara first to pick up people and in Santa Clara we had to leave the plane, go through security, take shoes off and board plane again. One hour+ process. Our flight was also delayed so our whole trip Toronto to hotel took 10 hours. Fly to Cuba, but use a better service provider. Sunwing treats you like livestock.

### "I will not recommend this flight"
Not Verified |  I couldn't check in online during both my flights to Cancun and back to Toronto. I tried multiple times from multiple browsers and systems but online checkin did not work. As a result they did not provide my family 2 seats to sit together (both ways) They couldn't get me any accommodation or changes on their flight seats inspite of checking in 3 hours earlier. I will not recommend this flight to even family of 2. And you will have to buy your seats extra than buying flight tickets.

### "satisfied with their service"
Not Verified |  We bought a package to Cuba for the first time at this company. We got a lot of alerts about the flight time before our flight to Cuba and when we flew back. Both flights were on time. In general, we are satisfied with their service. I would just recommend them to create a live chat for addressing customer's inquiries who are abroad.

### "never fly Sunwing again for a vacation"
I am absolutely disappointed with Sunwing. When we booked our trip with two little kids and a tall husband we upgraded to the front of the plane. Normally they have people stand behind the elite plus seats stand behind in economy to wait for the washroom. Instead they allowed them to stand in our leg room to wait for the bathroom. The flight attendants were not impressed to be working, and were made if anyone came through the curtain to use the bathroom as they were gossiping and reading magazines. We knew that meals were not served but there has always been an option to buy onboard meals, they clearly outlined that there is only snack available - for a 6 hour plane ride. They came through twice offering water - in 6 hours, and were annoyed at that. Then the real kicker, we land in Montego bay at 315pm. We go through customs, get our luggage and head outside to our bus. Waiting on the hot bus until 4:30 they offered us $5USD beer. When they finally started driving we were in rush hour. A 1 hour 15 min bus ride took us 3.5 hours. They lied to us and said it wouldn't be much longer but we would be stopping for a break, which added another half hour to our trip. After sitting in the airport for 2 hours, sitting on a plane for 6 hours, and then a bus for 4 additional hours (wait time, break and rush hour driving) -- We were not impressed. We all grabbed a sandwich for the plane (which was not refrigerated) ate at lunch and then didn't get a meal until 730pm. NOT IMPRESSED. On the way home the bus came to get us 2 hours late, no one told us our plane was delayed, so we sat in the lobby waiting, then when the bus arrived they took us to the airport where the sunwing representatives were annoyed and rude. And again on the way home the flight attendants were annoyed to be working, and allowed people to stand in our space as we upgraded our seats again. Shame on you Sunwing for not appreciating your customers, shame on you for sending us in traffic at rush hour, when you could move flights by two hours either way to avoid the whole situation. Not impressed and will never fly Sunwing again for a vacation. I realise you are cutting costs wherever you can, but not offering children something other than $7 pringles is insane to me.

### "I don't know what is going on with Sunwing"
First the good - the airplane staff are excellent. The rides to and from the airports and hotels were excellent as well. They were coaches and were on time both ways. The Bad: - The Edmonton Airport's signage is terrible and Sunwing booking agents aren't there until 3 hours before any flight so it's difficult to to know where you should be unlike other airlines or other airports. We were delayed 9 hours leaving from Edmonton, while we know others we met on our journey were delayed up to days of delays. We were delayed 1 hour leaving from Cancun. Notifications were received by myself but our travelling buddies who were signed up, did not. Then all of a sudden days later, they did? On the plane to Cancun we were in row 8. They ran out of most everything by the time they got to our row! Are you kidding me! On the plane to Edmonton we were in row 10 but it didn't matter because all they had were junk food, pop, tea, coffee and water. I don't know what is going on with Sunwing, but we won't be travelling with them anytime soon.

### "I will be looking to the competition next time"
Sunwing has gone super cheap and has started nickel and diming. Two days before our flight we were notified that there would be no more free carry-ons starting within a week. Only free thing you can carry on is a tiny personal item. A small gym bag (that would fit comfortably under the seat in front of you is too big to qualify). Then, on the flight, they announced that on on our return flight there would be no meals for purchase. Snacks only (for purchase). They also announced that there would no longer be free beverages (juices or soft drinks). Only water, coffee and tea would be free. Everything else had to be purchased. They also announced that there would be no duty free on board on the way back. All this on top of the fact that Sunwing uses the furthest/cheapest gates and has the worst flight times(than competitors is the sun vacation routes), means I will be looking to the competition next time.

### "such an inconvenience"
Not Verified |  I'd like to know why this airline has to transport it's passengers from Terminal 3 to a small good for nothing Terminal, 2 miles away by bus, when West Jet (same company) has it's passengers board at Terminal 3, with plenty of gates open. This is such an inconvenience. Plus they haven't changed since the last time we flew with them in 2020. What's up SunWing! I've flown SunWing about 10 times now. I guess it's time for a change.

### "Avoid this company at all cost"
Not Verified |  We use Sunwing for all inclusive in Cancun of 7 days. We lost 1 day because of Sunwing. First flight was a 8h30 in the morning, the send us one email few hours before that the flight is delayed at 21h, for a mechanic problem. We were already at the airport. We had to fight only to get taxi voucher. Came back, did all the check in and security. At 20h30, they put on the screen of the airport that the flight was delayed to 6h in the morning the next day. Again, we had the argue just to know why. The Pilot didn't show up. At least they gave room to everybody. We had ours at midnight, only for a nap and a shower. By the law, they have to give us 500-1000$ of compensation because its there fault. They said it was for safety and don't give any compensation. Avoid this company at all cost.

### "never again use the airline"
Not Verified |  This is the second time I’ve used Sunwing and both time have been a nightmare. Never mind my family and I (7 people) upgraded our seat and spent a additional $700 for this and all we got was a little more legroom. No tv’s no free meal not even a place to charge our own electric’s so we can maintain during our flights. Coming home the flight attends use the front of the planes over heads for their carry ons and we had to store our carry on’s back farther where they were out of sight. All our information, money and ID was out of sight. As my mother tried to tell the few people on the plane they need to store there bags where they were seated. Think they belonged to them. A argument started between my mother and a another passenger. I had to intervene because a women was yelling at my mother. Both flight attendants just watched and said nothing to calm the situation or take responsibility for there baggage. Once we where seated B1 I was told one our way to our destination to store my very small purse under my seat. So knowing that I did the same thing on our way back. A flight attendant told me it is for the people behind me and need to store it in the over head behind me. I did not want to do that and wasn’t what I did on the way to our destination. She then gave me a hard time. So as I waiting for people to take there seats so I could put in the over head she stood there giving me dirty looks then started making fun of my nationality which is Canadian. To top this experience off a women who was in a wheel chair who sat beside both ways had to get out the wheelchair herself and go to her seat as the flight attendants watched her. This women needed assistance and they did not give her any. I had to help the woman put on her seat belt and help her through the flight. The flight attendants seen this and yet still did nothing. Also they gave her the same issues about her purse as well. The flight attendant finally said she would store both purses in the emergency over head above us. The woman then asked the flight attendant for help with the AC which I tried to help but the AC wasn’t blowing strong enough. The flight attendant said she would get her ice water but never did. This experience was unbelievable and I will never again use the airline. We spent almost $2000 per person x’s 7 and this is how we are treated.

### "I had to pay for the baggage again"
I had paid for my baggage over the phone (i have my credit card charged) but they never entered it in their system and I had to pay for the baggage again. Now I'll have to spend time to dispute it and may not get refund. It appears Canada does not have a decent airline. I try to avoid traveling as much as possible

### "they have the gall to ask me to pay extra"
Not Verified |  Changed my flight from 8pm to a flight at 10.30pm from Lynx Air (Not even the same airline, by the way!). Not only do I now have to work with landing in my destination at 1.30 am, Lynx doesn't offer carry-on baggage (which I paid for with Sunwing!). Then they have the gall to ask me to pay extra in order to switch back to my original flight. Uh, no. I already paid for that. Same goes for the carry-on. 0 compensation for that as well. Disappointing.

### "Everything went just fine"
Despite the risks and bad feedback, my wife and me decided to take the Sunwing trip package to Royalton Cayo Santa Maria. Everything went just fine! Check-in at Toronto airport was quick. There were no long lines as we expected. The aircraft WG302 flew out on schedule. We booked seats in advance through the Sunwing website. But there were still empty seats, the plane was not full. Great service! It was possible to take drinks and various snacks during a 3-hour flight. No quibbles about masks. Baggage at the airport was issued quickly, no delays. The return flight was also hassle-free. Although the plane was flied 1 hour late from Toronto, they stopped less in Santa Clara Airport and cut the gap to 30 minutes when we landed in Toronto. In Pearson Airport we also got our luggage fast at 2 am and passed through all the checkouts. Thanks a lot to the Sunwing team for a great vacation!

### "Never will book another flight with this airline"
Not Verified |  Terrible service, we booked a 5 day trip , we paid for it, they called us one day before the trip and informed us our flight at 7 am has delayed to 9:00 pm, now we would arrive at Punta Cana 2 am at night. So lost a day that I have paid for it and have medical conditions that cant stay up that late. Never will book another flight with this airline.

### "there were issues with Sunwing flights"
We went on vacation in an all inclusive trip to Jamaica from April 11 - April 18 2022, well with the flight delays it was more like no sleep and April 19 2022. The resort was the worst one I have ever been at, the people were rude, the Sunwing rep onsite was never available to talk to. When flights were delayed, no one informed us, it was only after missing the pickup time and panicking with a family of 5 that we found out there were issues with Sunwing flights. This costed us meals, stress and a day of work. I am so upset. There is so much more but this is the surface issues.

### "rescheduled our flight 8 times"
Not Verified |  They have rescheduled our flight 8 times. We have small children and a baby and they have had such poor communication. We are running low on diapers and formula. They never respond. Terrible customer service.

### "A little training badly needed"
Not Verified | Toronto to Cayo Santa Maria. My husband and I along with another couple booked an all inclusive vacation through Sunwing to Royalton Cayo Santa Maria Cuba. First I must say that the resort was perfect in every way! Beautiful, clean resort with a stunning beach. The best part was their world-class customer service. The staff upon our arrival were so welcoming and it didn’t stop for the entire week. Very friendly, helpful and genuinely cared, wanted to help and be there for anything we needed. Very impressive. Sunwing on the other hand could certainly learn much from the Royalton staff. At the airport, on the plane and on the ground when we arrived in Cuba Sunwing staff kind of made us feel like they would be having a good day if it wasn’t for their pesky customers bothering them! A little training on customer service and how to provide it would go a long way and is badly needed at Sunwing!

### "This was not the most relaxing start to our vacation"
Indifferent management sours the experience! That old saying about one bad apple spoiling the bushel really applies to Sunwing. The ground and flight crews were wonderful: friendly, helpful, good sense of humour, professional...top notch. The same holds true for the in-destination reps and shuttle providers. All very pro and we thank you very much! The sour taste in my mouth comes from management - or lack thereof. I purchased my travel package online and paid for it in full at the time of booking. 2 days before my departure, I logged in to get my e-docs and was informed (by automated pop-up message) that I had a balance owing on my invoice and that my trip could be cancelled if I didn't settle my account. I immediately called Sunwing customer service. The service rep initially argued with me until I forwarded her my confirmation email from Sunwing showing the balance paid in full (yes, I keep everything). It took one hour and fourteen minutes on hold to resolve the discrepancy. Perhaps they were hoping I would simply give up and pay the difference of $140? This was not the most relaxing start to our vacation. Once I received written confirmation of the correction, I thanked the rep for her help and asked to speak to a manager. The manager was "on lunch" so I asked for a call back. 5 hours later, I had still not heard back so I emailed the original rep again. 2 weeks later, I have still heard nothing. No explanation for the arbitrary price hike, no offer of compensation for my inconvenience, no apology for the rep's initial antagonistic attitude or for my wasted time on hold while they corrected their own error. Nothing. I promise to update this review if I ever hear back from Sunwing. I don't really expect to. What a sad excuse for "service".

### "You made my experience a good one!
This is a big shout out to Sue working for Sunwing at the Toronto Airport. Thank you for your excellent customer service! You are a gem and a great face of your company. You represented Sunwing exceptionally well when you assisted me with my check-in while I had a meltdown. When you later showed up to make sure I was safe on the flight I was full of gratitude. You made my experience a good one and I thank you! It takes great people to make a great company. You are one of them.

### "A company to be avoided at all costs"
Not Verified |  I made the unfortunate mistake of booking with Sunwing in mid December for a trip to Mexico over the holidays. Due to pandemic related concerns, I used their Worry Free Cancellation to cancel the trip on December 17. I was provided with a voucher reference number and was told it would take a month to be issued. I contacted Sunwing at the beginning of February to rebook and was told my voucher had not been processed and a timeline for issuing it could not be provided. Disappointing to say the least. Questionable business practices based on the many reviews with the exact same experience. A company to be avoided at all costs.

### "Poor customer service"
Not Verified |  I would have been flying to Cuba at the end of March. However your incompetent staff neglected to inform when switching the names on the itinerary, the seat would be lost with no way of regaining it back. Worst airline ever. Will never use again as now my what was vacation is now non existent. With a lot more monetary loss than what was refunded. Poor customer service.

### "Canceled trip and will never use Sunwing again"
Not Verified |  Book a vacation with Sunwing. A month after booking get email that flight has been canceled. Give me the option to get a refund or move to 2 days later. The other date doesn't work great as it uses 2 more vacation days. However, we are traveling with a group so we'll make it work. That is when they tell us "oh, btw, it's another $900 to book on the date they provided". What it amounts to is price gauging. 2.5 hours on hold with Sunwing and same result. Canceled trip and will never use Sunwing again. Beware - If the price of your trip increases Sunwing will simply cancel your flight and resell it back to you at a higher price.

### "paid for extra leg room but never get it"
I have My flight changed from direct to one stop with out compensating the difference. I paid for the extra leg room seat but never get it. My flight had delay on the way back, the hotel was terrible, and the worst thing is the Sunwing team wont do anything to make people happy for all inconvenient they make. I receive email to represent my feedback about my trip but even the link they provide doesn't work.

### "Sunwing will not be our carrier"
Not Verified |  It seems Sunwing does everything in it's power to be late. Yes the weather was bad, but Flightradar24 indicated most other flights were leaving on time. Our return flight from Santa Clara Cuba was delayed over four hours because the incoming flight from Ottawa was severely late leaving. And Sunwing has decided that it's cheaper to fly us home via Cancun Mexico, an 800 kilometer detour to pick up more people rather than have two flights. Inconvenience the customer over customer service. Air Canada and Westjet have issues as well, but nothing compared to the woes of Sunwing. We will travel to the south again, but Sunwing will not be our carrier.

### "Worst service ever"
Not Verified | Worst service ever. I need to change my reservation, and they would not allow me to as i booked through a travel agent, normally that would be fine, but my travel agent had a family emergency (her mom died) and its a small business of only her. I explained this and the would still not allow me to make any changes. I understand policy, but there needs to be exceptions for deaths or emergencies. I now might not even get to go on my trip. Not that a large corporation cares.

### "Sunwing doesn’t much care for you"
Last minute notification that instead of 8am Ottawa direct departure departure it would be 12:30 (early afternoon) and then stopping in Toronto first! This meant a total day of travel arriving at destination 10 pm. This is most times the case and shameful that Sunwing doesn’t advise you of this. Calling Sunwing is the worst. They have no idea how to communicate and treat you as stupid. Systems” are always down and please call again another time. They rate a 1 out of ten for every call made to customer service. The only pleasant people at Sunwing are the booking agents. Use another all inclusive if you can. Sunwing doesn’t much care for you after they have your money….

### "I never will choose them for my vacation"
When we booked our vacation in November, we were supposed to get a direct flight from saskatoon to Cancun and vice versa. One week before our vacation they informed us that it won't be a direct flight anymore and it will go to Regina and over there you have to change the plane and I asked if we can cancel it and the rep said No because on terms you agreed that Sunwing could change it without notice, I paid a lot to get a direct flight with 5-star inclusive hotel and asked if they will issue us a voucher or return any money to us and she said No. you don't have any choice just we let you know. The 9am flight changed to 7am and it had delayed in Regina because obviously, they gather travelers from 3 different cities in one area to go so we had another 2 hours delay in Regina and when we reached to Cancun, we totally lost a day as around 7pm we were in our hotel so a vacation starts with a disaster and instead of 5-6 hours flight It took us 11 hours however we paid for premium, good for Sunwing's pocket! On the return, they took us 5 hours before our departure, without they inform us that it will be a Winnipeg, Regina, and Saskatoon combination flight, they issued our tickets to Saskatoon, announced the gate, and on the last minute, they changed it to Winnipeg gate and on the air told us that you should get unplanned in Regina. When we got to Regina, they weren't ready at all. they redo everything like a new traveler that just got to the airport till we reached to our gate and it took over 3 hours in mid of the night plus another 1-hour delay, a total of 14 hours from hotel to Saskatoon! We didn't receive any apology from them at all and it hurt us a lot. In general, transportation was a disaster and we all got very unhappy and disappointed with Sunwing and I never will choose them for my vacation. I had a good experience with them before it is why I didn't look at other options such as Westjet vacation but definitely from now on, they will be my last option.

### "surprised at the service offered"
5 days Missing luggage. Credit gift card offered, as compensation for the missing luggage, had “No Credit”. 5 days into our 7 days vacation, and only now was found in Toronto. It never left the airport. Sunwing website not functioning and No one to reach. My kid is 8 years old. He prepared for this trip a long time ago. Preparing his bag was the most exciting experience to get ready for beach time after two long years of quarantining and online schooling. And finally, it’s time for a vacation and beach time. Our air flights were booked through Sunwing airlines. We arrived to Cancun and his luggage is missing. No where to be found. We had to leave the airport. It’s now Thursday and we arrived to Cancun on Sunday. We pretty much bought all what we can from the limited gift shop at the resort, that fits his size. Which were 2 shirts, a swimming suit and something for his foot. Plus a toothpaste and tooth brush. And that’s all what they had for him to wear. The airline’s representative at the resort was trying to help us file a report online on sunwingcares.ca and the website is not working. He had to communicate this information and do the report manually through someone on the other end. Then he said that Sunwing will give us some compensation credit on a gift card to use, as a thank you for your patience and understanding. As much as the credit gift card won’t make a difference. I was still very appreciative and tried to get my little one to still enjoy and focus more on the trip and try to manage with anything we can get from the gift shop. But again, As I was paying for something for him to wear. The card Sunwing gave us as a compensation declined! We left everything on the counter with the girl at the gift shop and ran out to bring any other personal credit card to finalise the purchases. These were all a series of disappointments with Sunwing. I remember the name of the Sunwing representative; Andres, at the Riu resort cause he was initiating all the possible ways to help us on his end. Also, forget to mention that the Sunwing team at the airport did not file any report and did not initiate any action. They kept directing us to get on the bus to go to the resort. I thought that may be we should get it by next day or so, at the resort! I assumed this might rarely happen, but would get straightened out by next day, cause there is a team in charge and I can pretty much rely on the reputation of Sunwing airline and their service. Unfortunately, I’m surprised at the service offered from the airport team. I can understand that covid and the pandemic had put a lot of pressure and strain on airlines, but also thought this is an opportunity to score such an experience with more clients to use Sunwing airlines again and again, since we were considering our next trip already with the friends and group who came with us on this trip. I look forward to see how Sunwing customer service can handle solving this issue. Otherwise, I don’t want to repeat it again with Sunwing and won’t recommend it. First issue: my little ones luggage is still in Toronto. Second issue: if you offer a compensation, please do it right. Third: I hope your “Sunwingcare” website starts working for others who would be in my position and might have valuable belongings in their missing luggages. The least thing is to get someone to communicate clearly

### "not be flying with Sunwing again"
I feel like I have been in a constant battle with Sunwing for the last year, I booked with them last year for April 2020 and had a credit with them due to the restrictions from covid. Which we didn’t mind of course we understood we got a voucher for our trip for the cancellation. Now we were able to go on our trip to Costa Rica so we decided to use our voucher. Not once when I’m the phone with them in 2020 did they mention that it we would have to pay for our whole trip again and the voucher would be applied in a certain time period. Again I understand that takes time just was taken back when on the phone booking our trip and at the very end of the phone call he mentioned that I would have to pay for the entire trip and the voucher would be applied to my card of choice. He stated it can take up to 3 weeks for it to go onto my card but he didn’t think it would take that long, he also mentioned he would send an email to fast track the money to get onto my card in 1-2 weeks. Take in I just paid another $3200. Now I am in Costa Rica 4 weeks later and still the money is not in my account. This is absolutely ridiculous to be out $3200 that would be used to our pay bills. Now while on vacation I am writing this review and stressed out because the people at Sunwing are incompetent. When calling our agent before I left for vacation (which was also ridiculous, hardly answers emails and his phone). I thought the point of Sunwing was that you could get in touch with your agent at any point but that is not the case, but when he finally did call back he now said “oh it can take up to 4 weeks but again I don’t think it will take that long” so my question is where the heck is my money? This is absolutely ridiculous and I will not be flying with Sunwing again.

### "Very inflexible"
Not Verified |  Very inflexible. I had to cancel my return flight from Los Cabos but they said we will not get any refund/future vouchers even though I had purchased a "worry-free" waiver initially. I told them that its nothing much I can do if my PR card hasn't arrived even though I had applied for it back in June (hoping to travel on 14 Nov). I called them several times and they said I can get travel vouchers only if I cancel the full booking (and that too I will get after 4-6 weeks).

### "never travel with Sunwing again"
Not Verified |  We travelled to Cuba last year (I would have posted this sooner but it has taken them more than a year to resolve our issue) and while the resort was nice we ended up getting hooked into a scam. During the orientation session we were told it was essential to book a place in the VIP Lounge “as soon as possible” for when we were leaving because: - the main hall of the airport has no air conditioning - the main hall of the airport has no food vendors - you get priority check-in - you get expedited baggage checks Well the long story short is all of it was an unequivocal lie. There was food and A/C in the airport and no priority services were offered. To make the best of it, the VIP lounge was oversold and some people had no place to sit. We paid $70 USD for two people to book the lounge. I contacted Sunwing immediately upon our return to discuss and figured it would be a simple reply... “sorry for your experience, we will gladly refund that amount”. Well after dealing with three employees including a manager and having Sunwing go back to the local resort provider we received a negative result from both. I even suggested a credit of $70 which of course would have ensured future business for them but even that was refused. We will never travel with Sunwing again!

### "I have never seen anything like this"
Not Verified |  I was on the second flight coming back under the new restrictions set by the Canadian government. When we arrived at our hotel we immediately set out to find our Sunwing rep to organize having the covid test done for our arrival home. He knew nothing about it, surprisingly. As Sunwings head office is in Toronto, I would hope they would communicate the laws necessary to travel. After two days of asking the Rep to find the information necessary for us to return home, we spoke with a few people on our resort who flew with Air Canada, they had a bus set up to take them to a clinic to have the test done. We realized Sunwing was not interested in helping us, we took matters into our own hands. I contacted the emergency hotline at the embassy in Ottawa, they emailed me a list of clinics in the Dominican that provided the test necessary under the new Canadian travel laws. We took a cab to the one closest to us, where we had to get a prescription for the test, we were told to come back the next day for the test. We went back the next day and needed a stamp? And were told to come back again the next day for the test. We realized we were being taken for a ride. After making friends with our cab driver, we finally had a translator and after 4 days of running around we got the test. What a waste of our time. After paying for our own way to the airport, as we had to go get our test results. We quickly realized that the plane to Montreal that was supposed to leave hours earlier left without it's passengers. It was chaos, I travel with work, I'm on a plane every six days, and I have never seen anything like this. People shouting, laying on the ground, sleeping in wheel chairs, screaming at Sunwing reps. It was crazy! As it turns out all of the information on the covid tests was written down inaccurately and Sunwing wouldn't accept it. The passport numbers were wrong, or the date of birth was wrong, or not even on it at all. Mine had my age but not birthdate (which is on my passport, and my passport number was correct making that a stupid and redundant argument). I called the doctor we used for the test, he quickly corrected the problem and emailed a new form, but then Sunwing wouldn't accept it because it wasn't printed? One Sunwing rep recommend that my girlfriend leave me because her information was ok but mine wasn't. Do you believe that? In the end they accepted our information but left dozens of people stranded, they just packed up and left, so unorganized, no announcements, nothing, didn't offer us a meal, a ride, not even a goodbye, nothing, they just up and left. The plane was almost empty, the flight attendant was not happy, but neither were any of us. I asked for a snack, after sitting on a tarmac for hours, she offered to sell me a sandwich. I declined. I never leave reviews like this, and I've never had a problem with Sunwing. But after watching Air Canada clients get there tests done without any issues, then watching them get on a plane without any issues, I had to say something. Sunwing was unorganized from the first second, I could go on, didn't email our confirmation, had no answers, didn't care about us. Our rep was happy to sell us an excursion, (which I would have loved to do if I wasn't spending my holiday running around to get a test) but could not care less about our safety or way home. I contacted Sunwing to offer them a chance to rectify or at least explain.

### "Shame on this company"
Not Verified |  My Fiancé and I booked a great trip through SunWing Vacations that was roughly $3,500 months before COVID and even bought the insurance. A week before we were going on our trip our government made it mandatory to isolate for 2 weeks once we arrive back and were not guaranteeing that we would even have a flight home so we cancelled (using the insurance that we bought). We were then told that we would not be getting our money back but would be getting a travel voucher (same as everyone even if they did not buy the insurance). I have called SunWing numerous times just to be told "sorry this is how we do it" or "Don't worry your voucher is good for 2 years". We are in a pandemic and SunWing is not even flying out of my province this year which means I only have 1 year left to use the voucher. 1st off what was the insurance for as it was the exact same as everyone else. 2nd can you not at least make the vouchers not expire as I paid a lot of money for this trip. Its not a $50 dollar gift card this is $3,500 dollars that was saved up to go on our first vacation together and you guys have ruined this. I would expect in these times a voucher that cannot expire or our money back. I work at the airport and will not be recommending this airline to anyone as they clearly have no remorse or compassion for people and are all about the profits. Shame on this company.

### "it was very pleasant"
Not Verified | I flew with Sunwing Airlines from Montreal to Puerto-Plata in 2019 and it was very pleasant. Sunwing had very good food on board and it was a ham sandwich in a croissant. They have friendly service. the down side is the seat. The seat is very hard to sleep in and my flight was 4h30. i did not have a lot of sleep. bathroom is like a normal 737-800 but its a bit dirty.

### "not be able to get the refund"
I made a payment to Flight Center for a vacation booked through Sunwing on the 10th March 2020. I inquired with my travel agent about what would happen if we could not travel due to COVID-19 on the 14th March, the possible refund options, the process, etc. I requested to know the process for refunds from my travel agent on 16th and 17th March. On 17 March, I saw that Sunwing (per their website which I have screenshots of) was suspending all southbound flights, after clicking the link I saw that customers travelling between 17 March and 9 April could either choose to be refunded in the form of future travel vouchers OR request a full refund to the original payment method (credit card). - After reading the above policy on the Sunwing site, I emailed my travel agent to request a cancellation of my vacation and the full refund to the original payment method (I also emailed her the screenshots of the above mentioned policy). - On the 18th of March, I received confirmation from my travel agent that the cancellation request had been processed and that I would receive a full refund to my original payment method in roughly 3 weeks. On the 31st March, I received an email from my travel agent stating that Sunwing's policy had changed and that I was not longer going to be receiving a refund to the original payment method as originally requested and confirmed, but would instead receive future travel vouchers valid for 24 months. - I reached out to both my travel agent and Sunwing who both stated that I would not be able to get the refund as promised and that there was nothing they could do to help me recover those funds.

### "great attitude"
Not Verified | Puerto Vallarta to Regina. My wife and I had a vacation booked in Mexico, having left Canada March 3, returning April 4, 2020, but with the COVID crisis, we did as prescribed by our government and health officials and tried to move our return flight ahead. We were successful in doing that with another airline, only to arrive at the Puerto Vallarta airport and find that a portion of our flight home had been cancelled with no communication. Needless to say, we did not get home March 21. Without any options left, a representative from another airline at the PVR airport suggested that we look at the Sunwing website; we saw that you could try standby with March 22 being their last flights out of PVR. We lined up early for a Calgary flight. The Sunwing reps were awesome in coming around frequently in a chaotic airport scene and updating information regarding remaining seats on various flights to Canadian destinations. We eventually took a Regina flight that had space and got us out of PVR 4 hours earlier. My wife and I travel regularly and we laud the entire travel industry for their efforts, their help and assistance, and their empathy in a very difficult time. We want to thank the airport representatives in PVR, all Sunwing staff, at check-in counters, and the entire flight crew for their care and attention, their professionalism and great attitude in this stressful time, not only for us as travellers, but also for them and their families. You have our gratitude as well as the gratitude of our families for getting us home! Thank you!

### "not going to reimburse us"
Not Verified |  Montreal to Cancun. Sunwing confirmed to us and on several occasions over the past week they have reimbursed us for our entire trip as it was impossible for us to travel due to the Covid-19. As we had not received the reimbursement, we contacted them today to find out what was going on and they told us that ultimately they were not going to reimburse us, even though we had a verbal and email agreement reimbursement.

### "humane and generous service"
Cancun to Kelowna. I can’t express my gratitude enough to Sunwing for their humane and generous service during the Corana Virus situation. While everyone we meet where left stranded by their airline Sunwing treated their customers with the outmost care. All services were provided as usual, the staff was conscientious and calm. We boarded our plane without delays and arrived at our hometown airport without a glitch. It will be with Sunwing that I will travel in the future. From the bottom of my heart I thank you.

### "only be getting a travel voucher"
I had booked the flight to and from Nassau in November for travel for March 15 to 22. The government advised people of not travelling outside of Canada on March 13. Around this time airlines began to revise their refund policy. I had completed a online form for Sunwing at their request due to a high call volume when the government made a stronger advisory about not going outside of Canada. The form was notice of cancellation. When I contacted Sunwing after 2 days of trying to call Sunwing I was advised that I would only be getting a travel voucher for future use because the flight was on the 15 and not the 17th or later. The dates make no sense. I wanted and should have gotten a full refund. Sunwing is temporarily suspends all operations on March 23.

### "we were left disappointed"
Not Verified |  After much contemplation about flying Sunwing again because of a less than satisfactory experience last year, we decided to give them another chance and booked a trip to Panama with them. Once again, we were left disappointed. We were enjoying our stay at the resort; as such, we inquired with Sunwing about extending our trip 3 days, moving our flight from Friday to Monday. We spoke with the resort and confirmed that we could keep our room and that the cost would be $644. Sunwing advised that the total, including the room, would be $1675.00 to extend our stay by 3 days. Our total trip for one week, which already included a flight home, was $2025.00. To me, this seems as though Sunwing was charging for flights all over again, even though we were already there and had already paid for a flight back. We obviously decided to keep our original departure date and when it was time to chose seats, we were unable to upgrade to Elite Plus as the seats were all blocked out, this happened on the way there as well, but when we got to the airport, there were still Elite Plus seats available. Once again, we reached out to Sunwing and they were unwilling to help and just kept telling us we had to talk to them at the airport and that we needed to book these seats 24 hours in advance, but I tried to and was not able to as check-in can only be done 2-12 hours in advance of the flight. By the time we got to the desk at the airport, there were no Elite Plus seats left together, only sporadic seats spread throughout the plane. Since we have arrived home, my husband has now noticed that his wallet was stolen from his checked bag and we have contacted Sunwing, who once again has just said it was not turned in to them and we need to file a report with airport security. My advice to you, spend the extra couple bucks and fly with another airline! !

### "staff were plain out rude to me"
Cabo to Calgary. Worst airline I have ever flown. Not only do they pack people in like sardines, their staff were plain out rude to me. Will never use Sunwing again.

### "extremely intoxicated behaviour"
Not Verified |  We arrived to the airport the date of Feb 6 2020 to board our Sunwing flight leaving from Montego Bay to Toronto Our initial flight was scheduled to leave at 3:50pm and arrive in Toronto at 8:00pm. As we got there around 2:00pm, we were not notified of any delays as we entered through security/customs. (I had "text and email alerts from Sunwing" that NEVER once notified me of any updates and changes.) Upon arrival into the terminal we were told our flight was delayed. But no one had a reasoning as to why it was. It was about a 3 hour delay. We waited for the time frame that they posted would be our boarding time, to only find out that it was delayed AGAIN! Every time we spoke to people, they had different answers on the reasoning of this. (either the flight we were supposed to be on had to be used for another flight, the flight is delayed flying in, or the flight was experiencing "mechanical issues". Time kept ticking by, and as it went over the 3 hour mark where we are supposed to be compensated for this extensive delay with a food voucher, the Sunwing staff was incapable of giving us real answers and helping us understand the issues that were occurring. We had to legit BEG for these food vouchers of $15. Whats great about Montego Bay airport Is that the airport officially closes at 5:00pm. This means no one can leave to reenter security, all the restaurants close as all the flights are typically done and out by that timeframe. It was well over 5:00pm and we were still waiting for food vouchers to be released. We did receive the vouchers until 7:30-8:00pm! By that time nothing was open. We were the only people in the airport. We sat there. Waiting for updates. Absolutely nothing. At 8:45pm was the first real update on what was going on. The flaps on the plane were defective. They all refused to let us leave the airport, to stay a night somewhere and get the next flight in the morning. Their grand idea was to make us wait to arrange an empty plane from Cuba, gather last minute staff for that flight and fly to Montego Bay to get us and take us home. Of course, you can only imagine how long that would take. Our flight continued to get pushed back more and more "11:45pm" they promised we would be boarding. Thats over 8 hours waiting in an empty airport with no food, they did not provide any water. You can only imagine the amount of families and older aged people on the plane who had to sit around for this time frame with little to no updates and zero care.. During this long and dreadful wait, there were patrons on our plane who got into their duty free purchases. One gentlemen was extremely intoxicated by 11:45pm. Dancing around, singing to the top of his lungs, causing nonsense, disturbing people's space. Of course no one was around to monitor his behaviour except the other drunk friends he was with. As we were boarding the plane after midnight, I had let the flight attendants of the his extremely intoxicated behaviour. Which mind you, is extremely illegal to board a plane when you are this drunk. They thanked me for letting them know of this occurrence, and proceeded to let him on the flight? I wish they would have even taken initiative to at least talk to him about his behaviour as it was extremely disrespectful to the other patrons on the flight that had to deal with him the rest of the way home. We were supposed to be home at 8:00pm on Feb 6, and did not get into Toronto until Feb 7 at 5:30am

### "Everyone was stressed, frustrated and annoyed"
Not Verified |  3 hour delay for no reason given. No apology from crew for the 3 hour delay. Sticky and dirty trays which I used wipes to scrub and clean. Rude flight attendants: not polite, speak with a rude tone, rushing through while people are waiting to use the washroom. Continue to close the blind making it uncomfortable to use the washroom, while waiting for the washroom, flight attendants continued to close the blind and speak about cutting off the use of the washroom so they can finally bring the carts through (which took them 1.5 hours to even offer water and no one was waiting for the washrooms for over 45 mins during take off and stable elevation). Not a good choice of dinner. Who eats sandwiches for dinner? Luckily we purchased dinner at Punta Cana airport. Headphones purchased weren't working. No movie playing. When leaving Toronto and arriving into Toronto, we had to leave the terminal in the freezing cold with no coats to get on a shuttle to take us to terminal 3. I wish we had been mentioned this before we booked with Sunwing. It was a horrible experience. Everyone was stressed, frustrated and annoyed.

### "experience was absolutely horrendous"
Toronto to Punta Cana. Would not recommend Sunwing at all. If you can go with another airline do so. Customer service is the last of their priority. No one to help you when you have a problem. Delay, delay delay. No one knows what’s going on . Always the same excuse (maintenance) We had an issue with a massive delay, their resolution was a $15 voucher. Which was to be used within the airport. When we tried to use it, it was only applicable to one store which had already been closed. Then again, no help, no service. Their resolution was to make things worse. We’ve travelled with Sunwing before and it has been acceptable but this experience was absolutely horrendous No point in the headache when there are others out there. Again would not recommend!

### "not offered any compensation"
Ixtapa to Toronto. Our flight was delayed over three hours on February 20th. The ground crew in Ixtapa kept telling us that they had maintenance issues with the plane and had to turn around and go back to Toronto. When we finally boarded the plane I asked the flight crew about the maintenance delay with the plane. They said that was not true but in fact the previous crew was over the hours they are allowed to work so therefore the Halifax crew was called to work this flight. Too bad Sunwing in Ixtapa couldn’t be more forthcoming with their answers. We were not offered any compensation at all for the delay.

### "I will never fly Sunwing again"
Hamilton to Varadero. We flew out Saturday jan 18 of 2020 only to be delayed five hours out of Hamilton airport was to arrive at 7pm but landed at 1230 am then we get through customs go to retrieve suitcase not there. Then when we were to fly back home we were to land at 12 midnight but it was 3.30 in the morning, so overall eight hours lost plus suitcase for three days. Put in a compensation report to sunwing they reply back is no compensation. I've never experienced such bad service. I will never fly Sunwing airlines again.

### "last time we fly with this airline"
Although you sign up for flight alerts you never get them. My husband and I live 2 hours away from the airport, and I always check online to save time but it never fails, flights with sunwing are always delayed. Boarding was a nightmare, my husband and I go on vacation once or twice a year, and this is definitely the last time we fly with this airline. We always fly from terminal 3, but this time, without any warning we were packed like sardines onto a shuttle bus and driven to a part of the airport I never new existed, and kept there waiting. Back from our two week vacation in Puerto Vallarta, our flight was late again. We were picked up from our resort at 5 PM just minutes away from the airport, our flight started boarding over 4 hours later, by then I had already made up my mind I would never fly with Sunwing again. When I checked our luggage I was told it was over the allowed weight by about a kilo or so, I asked If I could pay for the Elite Plus seats which allows extra weight, he said no, and charged me $156 extra, $78 for each bag. seats on the plane are uncomfortable, retrieving your luggage at the airport takes hours. When we fly with other airlines our luggage is there waiting for us when we're done checking in. I would give this airline the rating of minus one if I could.

### "staff were amazing"
Not Verified |  Recently flew Sunwing from Montreal to Santa Clara Cuba with Sunwing for an all inclusive vacation. Flights were all on time and staff were amazing. We also had to move from our resort due to power issues in Cuba and the Sunwing Rep , Milvy made it a very easy ordeal.

### "an out of date airline"
Toronto to Montego Bay. Terrible airline and won't fly with them again. Tickets and website say you can check in on-line but it wasn't working when I tried. No option to check in or choose seats. They warn you that tickets will have to be printed, no electronic tickets. In this electronic age, this just isn't acceptable. We live 2hrs from the airport so leave early not knowing what the weather/drive would be like. I had downloaded the Sunwing app and also signed up for alerts from Pearson Airport. As we arrived at the airport I got notification from Pearson that our flight was delayed an hour but nothing from Sunwing. We couldn't check in at the kiosks and had to go to the desk where I got attitude from the agent. Sunwing is supposed to fly out of Terminal 3 but we find out that we actually have to take a shuttle from T3 to "infield concourse". Basically no man's land. We check it out and are told by staff not to go over until 1 hr before our flight because it's small and doesn't have much there. Sounds logical. We find out at that point that our flight is further delayed another hour. In talking to others at the airport on the way home, we find out there were $20 vouchers provided for the late flight from Toronto but it was only announced once in the "infield concourse". So we didn't hear it because we were in the main terminal as we were told to stay there. As it was, the only options to spend the $20 vouchers was overpriced junk food and grab and go because there are no other food options at the infield concourse. When we finally depart it's over 2 hrs from our original flight time. Seats are uncomfortable and lacking in padding. In flight entertainment consists of re-runs of sitcoms. We arrive in Montego Bay very late.... and our checked baggage is no where to be found. There were at least 5 others who also did not receive their luggage. The attendant in MB was in no hurry to help even though it was late and people were frustrated. He would only help one person at a time. We did eventually get our luggage late the next day. A horrible start to our vacation. On the way back to home, our flight was also late leaving but no info provided at all. The flight wasn't full but the seating didn't make any sense. Some rows had 2 people crammed in them while others only had 1 person on in them. The flight attendants wouldn't let people change seats. Back to no man's land and onto a shuttle bus back to T3. It's clear that Sunwing is an out of date airline who has been exiled from the mainstream operations at Pearson.

### "trying to forget this trip ever happened"
Flew from Toronto to Cancun Feb 6th 2020. worst travel experience in my life. I will never travel with Sunwing again and will warn anyone and everyone about this airline. Our flight was delayed 2.5+ hours as we were stuck on the plane for this duration all that was offered was one tiny cookie. I forgot my phone on the plane and informed Sunwing ASAP about this. The only response I got from Sunwing was we're looking into this. Emailed throughout the week to me. They responded on the day before we were to fly out that they don't have it and to check with Toronto Pearson lost and found. Once we arrived we asked a Sunwing rep at baggage where lost and found was and she just pointed and said that way. We asked a Toronto Pearson security guard he then informed us that lost and found is closed but that we can file a claim online so I go online to find out that I need contact the airline for items lost on the plane. So I've been running around in circles trying to get an answer. Since we got to our resort extremely late and we had a long day of travel we were unable to attend the meeting the next morning. I checked daily looking for our rep who I never found until the day before our departure. Since we had a private transfer I asked the time for our pick up and was given the wrong time. On our return flight, I got up before the plane was moving just after we boarded to go to the washroom. The flight attendant at first refused and said I couldn't use the washroom. Then I was given attitude and was told that I need to move fast because we are leaving now. I moved quickly. I get back to my seat and we haven't moved, we're not even close to moving. She had zero issues letting the 10 other people who went well after me. Then come the drinks and coffee she fully ignores me asking for a drink when her cart reaches my row serves A, B, C, D, skips E and serves F. and rolls the cart away. I have so much more to say about this horrible experience but because it was an absolute nightmare I'm trying to forget this trip with Sunwing ever happened. My advice pay the extra and fly with WestJet or Air Transat. They are worth spending the extra money!

### "Awful, awful, awful experience"
Not Verified |  Cancun to Toronto with Sunwing Airlines. Awful, awful, awful experience. Major delays on both ends of travel. Pick up from hotel was over an hour late. More than an hour to get luggage back when at Pearson. Never fly with this airline. So terrible.

### "I will never use Sunwing again"
Not Verified |  My husband and I flew from Sudbury to Cuba in December 2013. I was 26 weeks pregnant. We had an early flight from Sudbury so we got to the airport early. Well of course our plane was delayed and we were provided with a lunch voucher since we had to wait that much longer. We were supposed to arrive in Cuba at 5:00pm. We eventually got picked up by a large 1/4 full plane from Sudbury, got flown to Ottawa, had to get off the plane at the Ottawa airport, and wait for them to get boarded onto the plane. It was approx 11:00pm at this time and we were stuck in the waiting area at the airport. Again, keep in mind that I was 26 weeks pregnant and they didn't provide any sort of meal or meal voucher since lunch time. We finally got everyone boarded in Ottawa and took off. Once we were in the air we were offered their generous champagne for the champagne flight! (about 2 oz of alcohol?). Around 2:00 am we were served food. In a nutshell, I waited from lunch until 2:00 am to be offered any sort of food on this trip. We finally arrived at the resort at 5:00 am (12 hours later than expected. Luckily the resort was top notch (Royalton in Cayo Santa Maria) and offered 24 hour food. Sunwing is disgusting with how they treat their passengers. No explanation for these delays and never a response to the many emails I sent. I will never use Sunwing again. We usually travel 2x/year.

### "really horrible travel"
Toronto to Cancun. That was really horrible travel with this airline, 2 hrs delay when we had a flight to Cancun, more than 4 hrs on the way back to Toronto. So unorganized and unprofessional. We usually go vacation 4 times a year and the first time flight with Sunwing but never ever again travel with Sunwing, worse experience ever, feeling really sick and exhausted, I missed my workday because of the delay.

### "never fly with Sunwing again"
Terrible experience, would not recommend Sunwing as a tour operator for All-Inclusive holidays. Trying to be creative in saving money, Sunwing started combining flights from Toronto to two different destinations (although the TripCentral web-site, were we bought our vacation packages showed 'Direct flight') - in our case they detoured us through Los Cabos before dropping off in our final destination of Ixtapa (Los Cabos and Ixtapa are almost 2 hrs of flight apart). We had to go through the customs in Los Cabos, collect our luggage and go through the whole check-in routing again. Normal flight that should take 5 hrs, took 9-10 hours instead, and for that time it would have been easier to fly to Europe. The crew only gave us soft drinks during the whole ordeal and as a bonus - tiny packs of cookies during the second leg of the journey. Due to lack of time in the interim destination they did not clean seats properly and the magazine pocket of my seat 28F contained traces of snacks from the previous passenger. On the way back fellow-passengers who flew from Toronto to Las Cabos via Ixtapa, had to disembark at Ixtapa, go through all that jazz with customs/luggage/check-in and in addition customs took away all the goods bought at the Duty Free in Toronto and charged them penalty. Instead of taking responsibility, Sunwing crew blamed Mexico customs. As far as I my family concerned, we will never fly with Sunwing again.

### "didn't like the food"
Not Verified |  Dartmouth to Cuba. The staff were very professional and welcoming. There is absolutely no leg room so on the return flight I purchased 'Elite Plus". More leg room but it did not improve the 'arm' space. What I really didn't like was the food! The pizza and smoked meat were disgusting. I find it hard to believe that an airline of this size can't find a decent food caterer.

### "overpriced and rip you off"
Punta Cana to Toronto. Sunwing delayed our flight with (no reason given) for 12 hours, the entire day lost. To try to make up for it they gave $100 vouchers to each passenger. I was travelling with my 2 children. Since then, I booked one big sunwing package to cuba (hoping to redeem the vouchers). They make you make the reservation first, then say they'll refund you the voucher value. I was under the impression that I'd get $300 back, but because my 8 and 2 year old were not on the trip, they only refunded me $100 back. Now again I booked through sunwing, a hotel (to try to redeem the remaining 200$, as I spoke to someone from sunwing who reassured me that they'd be redeemed). Again, I was tricked into placing this new reservation with sunwing, and they are denying the vouchers. Bottom line is, Sunwing is overpriced and rip you off, they trick you into spending more money with them, looking for any excuse to not honor vouchers given for their own mistakes. The whole point of the vouchers to begin with were to try to make the customers/travellers compensated for losing an entire day and in the end it turned out to be just a scheme to get you to spend more money with them. I travel very often and have never left a bad review for anything, me taking the time to write means I don't want anyone else being ripped off and tricked by this company. They have no pride, fairness or desire in creating customer loyalty or satisfaction. I would definitely never book through or with them again, and not recommend it.

### "next time our trip will be booked with someone else"
Not Verified |  Flight was 2 hours late to get to Punta Cana. Flight was an hour late to board in Punta Cana. Trying to get any help in Punta Cana from Sunwing, they ignore us because they can’t speak our language. Then on the plane, no entertainment at all. Last trip with another airline, there was a movie on to help with my stress of flying. They ran out of food so we had to eat crackers instead of an ok meal. Then at the resort, we were harassed for tours, over and over even after saying no again and again by the same Sunwing people. And then going to Grand Memories resort, we got told we could not be on the beach area because it was reserved to Royalton. So next time our trip will be booked with someone else. Flight attendants on plane all look grumpy coming back from Punta Cana.

### "Old plane, cramped space"
Saskatoon to Punta Cana. Old plane, cramped space, in flight entertainment was a few episodes of Big Bang Theory and Fresh Prince of Bel Aire? Put screens in each headrest and lose a row of seats. The food is pretty blah and on the way back they took a detour for more fuel because they "accidentally" overloaded the plane. Added about 3 hours to the flight. The Dominican Republic charges 20$ US (only payable in cash) to leave the country, reputable airlines include it in the price so you don't have to scramble to the extortion oops I mean currency exchange while an entire jet has to wait for you. Spend a bit more and have a nice flight with someone else.

### "would never recommend Sunwing"
Paid for direct flight January 27, 2020 from Santa Clara to Saskatoon. Flight delay of 2 hours Arrived at airport. When boarding began heard from other passengers that we were going to Montego Bay. When in Montego Bay pilot stated we will be going to Windsor Ontario to fuel up. Arrived in Saskatoon at 4:40 in the morning nearly 6 hours late. Sunwing does not give customers accurate information and provides very poor service. We would never recommend Sunwing. Buyer beware! !

### "never fly with Sunwing again"
I am almost in too much pain from having to use the unavailable washroom to write this review. We are currently refuelling in Hamilton because the flight has been overloaded. I am a medium to small size woman, and there is inadequate leg and arm room around my seat. They played the same old episode of Big Bang theory on our flight to and from Punta Cana .. come on! I will never fly with Sunwing again.

### "will definitely avoid"
Flew yesterday from Punta Cana to Hamilton and had an exhausting day with multiple delays. They claimed de icing was the issue, yet it was above freezing with rain in Hamilton so that wouldn’t really make any sense. The worst part was after finally boarding, they went full throttle with the engine to take off and then the plane stopped. It was a terrifying experience. We thought something was wrong with the plane. The pilot let us know that they had forgotten two passengers and we had to go back to the gate? We were almost in the air! Not sure how these passengers could have missed the flight with all these delays to begin with. The apologized but we had to wait another 45 mins at the gate and we not compensated in any way for yet another not only inconvenience but very nerve wracking experience. I’d like to add that in the southbound flight my husband and I ordered food that’s apparently from a chef? The food was so nasty. His wrap was freezing cold and when we asked the flight attendant if it was supposed to be cold she just said, yes, in a snarky tone and kept moving. I will definitely avoid flying with Sunwing in the future.

### "Worst flight I have ever taken"
Flying back from Miami to Toronto. Boarding time was 11.20, waiting and nothing was told to us, boarded at 12.20. Apparently there was a snow storm in Toronto and a 3hr flight turned into a 6hr flight going to Hamiliton and sitting on the plane for over 2hrs. Mind you our flight was to land at 3pm. No food was offered to us, only one small cookie and water. Hungry and frustrated for hours sitting on the plane, stating it was gonna leave to Toronto every 15 minutes and never did. Once landed in Toronto around 9pm, had to take a shuttle to customs and baggage claim. Once customs was done, getting our baggage was a hassle. 3 times they told us different areas to pick up luggage, waiting and waiting, my luggage was no where to be seen, finding my luggage in a totally different area, then told. Worst flight I have ever taken and worst experience getting my luggage.

### "bait-and-switch marketing"
Our experience on Sunwing Airlines (Toronto-Ixtapa-Toronto) was a microcosm of many of the other disparaging reviews on this site: bait-and-switch marketing, leading to itinerary changes that turned what was supposed to be a 5-hour return leg into an 8.5-hour endurance test; sudden "mechanical issues" resulting in plane-changes on both legs after boarding; appallingly crowded check-in conditions in Ixtapa that required passengers to line up outside in the boiling sun; decrepit, horribly uncomfortable cabins; food shortages; furious passengers whose luggage had been lost — the list goes on. Sunwing is just plain bad. It makes Aeroflot of the 1980s look exemplary. Spend a few hundred more and save yourself tons of aggravation. As one irate fellow passenger put it: "The first time it's Sunwing's mistake. The second time it's mine.

### "Never been so cramped"
Not Verified | Kitchener to Punta Cana. Staff were great but sorry Sunwing will never fly with you again until you make more space on your seats! Never been so cramped on a plane ever and I’m not very big!

### "flight home was another nightmare"
Toronto to Cancun return. We booked our vacation with Sunwing 4 adults and 8 children ages ranging from 13,10 and 2 twin babies 1. They boarded us on our flight to Cancun leaving us on it for over 2 hours at the airport while they de-iced it before we even took flight - making a 3hr45min flight a 6.5hr flight without even providing us with a meal to feed our children but forcing us to purchase overpriced wraps. Our flight home was another nightmare. Sunwing boarded us unto plane platform leaving all passengers trapped in the tunnel as there was no plane to load onto due to a fuel leak - the ignorance we received from the staff that never once bother to explain what and why we were trapped in a tiny tunnel they wouldn’t return our boarding passes so we could cancel and book any other flight home. The food was terrible, no space whatsoever, they didn’t turn any shows on until flight was 3/4 over.

### "completely disorganized"
I did an all-inclusive family trip to Cancún, Mexico from Toronto, Canada. Hands down the worst service I have ever had with an airline. The return flight was a complete mess, from the resort pickup (which is provided by Sunwing) - the bus was late about 50mins. At this point in time, many are starting to get hungry as it is close to 6 PM. No one wants to leave for fear that the bus shows up and we are left behind. At the resort it is stressed by Sunwing representatives that you have to be in the lobby for pickup, the bus will not wait for you and if pickup is missed you have to find your own way and pay yourself. With the bus being almost an hour late, all of us could have gone to grab something to eat for free while still at the resort with our wristbands on. Many people, myself included checked out early from our rooms thinking the bus was going to pick us up on time. I could have had the room longer and had my 80-year-old grandma who was travelling with me be more relaxed, instead of checking out early and waiting in the lobby and for hours. Upon arriving at the airport to check-in some Sunwings employees started to inform people that our flight was delayed an hour and 45mins and then other employees not informing any of us at all. I had overheard this at the counter beside where I was checking in and luckily the lady checking in was from my resort and she said “Hey! Did you just here this? The flights delayed over an hour!” I asked the guy who was checking me in at the moment and he then said “Oh yeah it’s late” (as if this isn’t something important). At the gate, many people still had no clue the flight was delayed and said no one told them when they checked in. After seeing a plane land around the time our original flight (9:40 PM) was supposed to depart, all of us thought okay it’s on time. We’re going to go home on time. Employees at the gate then informed us that this plane is picking up passengers to go to Montreal instead and that we had to wait till 11 PM when another plane would be coming. More and more passengers started to complain that the employees then started telling us different times of when we will be departing. Everyone got fed up and we asked for a manager we were told the manager would be coming in 5 mins, 20mins past and then we were told the manager isn’t there but a supervisor said he would come. No one came for another 10mins, then a random Sunwing employee came and proceed to lie as well. Then finally she said a plane is in the air and it will be here at around 11:30 PM and we should be taking off at 12:30 AM. At this point we have been here at the airport several hours, stores are closed and there’s nothing for us to buy. Some passengers asked for food vouchers but we were told they were not approved to give any out to us. If we wanted we can send in a complaint online to Sunwing. A fee other things happened but long story short, the plane was up in the air at exactly 12:38 AM and we arrived in Toronto at 3:54 AM. After waiting for luggage, going through customs and taking a taxi, I arrived home at around 5:20 AM. Resulting in calling into work at 7:30 AM to say I won’t be coming in due to this delayed flight, thus losing a day’s worth of pay. Will never ever fly Sungwing again and definitely do not recommend flying them either. Their customer service is absolutely horrible and they’re completely disorganized! They’re a complete mess, save your time and money and fly with a better airline!

### "all-round bad organisation"
Not Verified | Montreal to Puerto Plata. Delayed 11 hours, short of staff and just all-round bad organisation. Sat on the plane for 3 hours after 5 hours delayed in the airport only to be moved back to the airport for another 3 hours. Will not be booking with them again.

### "delayed for roughly two hours"
Toronto to Vancouver. This flight was delayed for roughly two hours to depart and arrived one hour and forty minutes late. At the same time, there was a lack of communication from the airline to passengers including myself. We were not informed of the situation until minutes before the scheduled departure time. Further, it was very difficult to experience genuine care from any of the cabin crew.

### "I will never fly with Sunwing"
Not Verified |  Orlando to Toronto. Our experience with Sunwing was terrible. The flight was delayed for almost three hours after we were all boarded. It took over an hour for the baggages to come out, and the baggage carousel number is even wrongly informed. We had another flight scheduled five hours after the scheduled arrival time, but we only had two hours left, and Sunwing refused to help us transfer the flight or do anything to make up. I will never fly with Sunwing.

### "wonderful experience"
Not Verified | Toronto to Cayo Coco. We flew out of Toronto on Christmas Eve December 24th / 2019 destination Cayo Coco. Our flight was excellent. The flight staff were humorous and engaging. Provided exceptional service. Considering it was Christmas Eve and I'm sure there were a million other places the staff would have preferred to have been than working, they maintained upbeat attitudes and made our flight to Cuba a wonderful experience.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
Cancun to Vancouver. I booked a Sunwing vacation package, for a 2-week trip December 11-25, 2019. This was a last minute trip, booked on the Monday and departing that Wednesday to a vacation in the Mayan Riviera. I upgraded to the Premium Elite Plus package. Ample leg room, although the seat support brackets for the row in front meant that my aisle seat had a more narrow area under the seat in front of me for leg room and fitting a purse. Seemed like a newer plane on the return flight but same set up for space under the seat in front of me. I found the flight crew on both the departing flight and returning flight to be extremely professional and friendly. Bathrooms kept clean and well stocked. Inflight entertainment a joke, but I knew that ahead of the trip. Brought a book to read instead. Flight departing arrived on time. Flight returning to YVR arrived almost an hour ahead of schedule. Flight crew offered beverages and food for purchase twice each during the flight. The snacks on the Bistro menu for onboard purchase are good. However, I do not recommend the Tex Mex Chicken wrap. Mine was dismal, tortilla shell mushy, and the cold taste of the wrap itself unappetizing. After two bites, I put it in a garbage bag. One of the flight crew noticed it when collecting garbage, and later informed her flight supervisor and he immediately processed me a refund. I wasn’t expecting a refund, it was only $10.99, but was a very nice gesture. I just wrote it off to airplane food. I have to wonder that if this wrap was served warm if it may have tasted better. I heard the pizza was tasty. Found the return flight super hot and stuffy. The 2 Elite plus seats next to me on the return flight were not occupied. The flight attendant noticed that and moved “two young kids” (his words) to them as they were in the exit row middle of the plane. Luckily they were teenagers but the girl in the middle seat didn’t seem to have any regard for being on a plane and me being next to her, and spread out so much and leaning on her tray table to rest she kept flipping her hair all over my tray table and in my drink. Or when sitting up, at times she was well over the arm rest space and in my area. She appeared to be maybe 13 and the friend moved with her was 15. I later learned their moms are friends and they were all travelling together. If moving ‘young kids’ as the flight attendant mentioned, it may have been more pleasant to consider not placing two ‘young kids’ within the Elite Plus seats. I am sure a few adults near their original seats could have swapped. And why were they assigned seats in the exit row in the first place if they were not an adult and allowed to sit there??? Just saying. My Sunwing package included airport/resort transfers. The transfer from Cancun airport to the resort took a while for the last few passengers and then departed. Only a 15 person van so nice not to have numerous drop offs. My return transfer from Grand Sunset Princess Resort to the airport was excellent. Pick up was a few minutes early and we were dropped off at the airport 20 minutes prior to being allowed to check in for our flights. Pick up at the resort was almost 4 hours before the flight departed. Only 10 people in our transfer to the airport, and no additional stops after I was picked up. Overall another happy experience with Sunwing. I know what I am getting up front and for this experience (I don't expect an Air France experience), overall they exceeded my expectations.

### "knew what to expect with a budget flight"
We have flown Sunwing before, so knew what to expect with a budget flight/hotel package to Huatulco from Vancouver. I opt for the premium seats, paying an extra $50 each way, which gives a bit of leg-room in the bulkhead, and to be near the washroom. But be warned that if you have an aisle seat, you will be constantly jostled by people using the facilities. If you get a window seat, you have to climb over your seat mates and hope they are nice people who don’t get annoyed at you stepping on toes, banging knees, or doing some creative choreography to not end up in their laps facing them. And then you have to go through the tiny galley, where the flight attendants are scrambling with meal and drink service. Let’s face it, this is a flying sardine tin, and changing in the tiny closet of a bathroom (in or out of weather-appropriate clothing) requires the skills of Houdini. (My husband quipped, “.. not enough room to change your mind, let alone clothes.”) On this trip home, we had to drop off passengers in Victoria, before a very quick flight to our final destination, Vancouver, 11:OO pm (1:00 am Huatulco time). When landed, the passenger count was off for some reason, and had to be recounted about 4 times. Flight attendant was snarky when I asked if a resolution was being worked out, and that she didn’t have an answer and I should take my seat. We missed our takeoff slot during this mishap, so what should have been an expedient unloading of Victoria passengers and very quick flight home landed us in our airport hotel about 2:00 am (4 am Huatulco time). Not terrible in comparison to other delays I’m reading about with this airline. They need a major improvement on their menu and execution of said menu. My husband was sitting across from the child from hell and his parents. This kid had screamed his way through the airport, prior to boarding, and they wound up on our flight. My sympathy for the parents dissolved when a passenger and the dad almost came to blows before the flight attendant intervened. Later, upon take off and landing, Dad refused to buckle the 4 yr old into his seat, and got into an argument with the flight attendant, who technically could have thrown them off the plane, and wish she would have. The kid calmed down, for the most part, for the rest of the flight. However, when we were delayed in Victoria, my husband moved up to sit with me and chat. When he returned to his seat, the child was sitting in it. The child had smeared gum under my husbands shoe, and it was ground into the carpet, no doubt under the watchful blind eye of his parents. I realized in the end that the flight attendant’s patience had been wearing thin all along, and bear her no ill will. I also realized that the crew’s start to Christmas Day wasn’t ideal either. Then our luggage was delayed. My conclusions: 1). Flying during the busy holiday season can be less than perfect. Things that cause delays are somewhat mysterious to us civilians, and may be based on facts that we aren’t privy to—although they could keep us better informed. 2). Wider aisles and wider seats are desirable, but if you buy a bargain package, don’t expect luxury. 3). Passenger behaviour and personal foul-ups may also be the cause of delays.

### "They treat customers worse than cattle"
Camaguey, Cuba to Toronto, Canada. Never fly Sunwing, the worst airline in Canada and probably in the world. They treat customers worse than cattle. They will not take your luggage to your destination because they carry cargo, and have no space for customers’ bags. Of course you find out about it after arrival. Right now we are stuck in Camaguey, Cuba because those greedy crooks changed the departure time from 11.10 am to 18.10, added 2 extra hours for an unscheduled stop over, and on top of that the plane is late 3 hours. It may still be further delayed. Instead of arriving in Toronto at 14.10, right now it looks like we might arrive at 2.30 am at the earliest the next day. That is over 12 hours after the scheduled arrival. It is unbelievable that they can get away with it as it happens with them all the time.

### "days with Sunwing are done"
Vancouver to Puerto Vallarta. My review is very much a negative response. I booked my flight early Sept for Dec. Originally the flight was to leave Edmonton then Vancouver. It changed by dropping EDM so I book a flight with Air Canada for early that morning as my flight was not till 11 am with Sunwing. We a week later it changed again to 6 am now I had to change flight with Air Canada at a charge plus get a room. Finally that part is done. Then they added Calgary onto my return now making me late to catch my flight with Air Canada back to EDM. So another $100 change fee and a $149.00 room as we did not arrive till 1125 but Sunwing in their wisdom somehow got our plane to Puerto Vallarta without a crew as we had to wait 2 1/2 hours for them to arrive but they only had enough hours to get to Calgary so another crew change and a long wait 1 1/2 hours so now we arrive at 2 am. My days to fly with Sunwing are done. Forgot the food I paid for. Gave away my priority seats. I tried to change my flight so that I could fly out of and into Edmonton but they refused to saying this was the trip I booked. Funny thing is I had bought the insurance but they failed to tell me it was good only up to 45 days before departure. They made all the changes within the 45 days. This is all noted on my file at Sunwing along with my dozen calls. We need protection against bad companies like this one. They don’t care as well they know there is nothing we can do to them.

### "Terrible customer service"
Toronto to Varadero. Terrible customer service. Delay for a flight with no explanation. Will miss the first night of our vacation thanks to this awful airline. If you intend on booking with Sunwing simply to save money, I highly recommend you just spend the extra bit and book with a reliable airline. Never flying with these people again.

### "Unimpressed with the delays"
Not Verified |  
Winnipeg to Cancun with Sunwing Airlines. Second time in a row we sat on a plane for 7 hours when it takes roughly 5 to Mexico. Unimpressed with the delays so will be choosing a different airline next time.

### "Not happy with Sunwing"
Not Verified |  Toronto to Holguin. Flight arrived on time initially as seen I the gate window, only to be delayed with no announcements on the PA system or apologies given. Pretty terrible customer service to customers who made the effort to show up on time only to be let down by Sunwing. Flight is now further delayed and still no reason given. Not happy with Sunwing.

### "I wont be flying them again soon"
Not Verified |  Saskatoon to Varadero. We show up at the airport at 4 am to catch our 7 am flight. At 6:30 am we overhear someone say the flight is delayed to 12:55 pm. We check and sure enough it"s true. There was no announcement about it until several people went to the gate to see what was going on. They said there was a problem with the plane, it had landed in Regina the night before around 9:30 pm and something was wrong with the mechanics. If they knew about the problem at 9:30 the night before, why didn't they get a plane in for the morning. As it was they decided at about 10 am to get one in from Toronto, a 3 hour flight away. Now we won't leave until 2 pm so they give us a total of $40.00 in two food vouchers, if you spend 10 out of 20 you lose the other 10, just great. As we are getting on the plane, finally, they give us each a $100.00 voucher to be used next vacation, within 1 year, or as resort credit. We have now lost 1 day of our holiday which is worth more than 100 bucks per head.There were some very rude Sunwing employees at the Saskatoon airport as well. We have flown Sunwing 6 times to Cuba and this was my first really horrible experience, bad enough that I wont be flying them again soon.

### "Delays are the biggest issue"
Toronto to Cancun. Delays are the biggest issue with Sunwing. Flights always gets delayed. Seriously, there was not a single time when they were not delayed. You are losing a day by choosing Sunwing. I really doubt I will fly Sunwing again. Last time (Nov 2019) the flight was delayed on the way there and back. 6+ hours every single time.

### "dread when I see Sunwing"
Not Verified | Toronto to Montego Bay. This is the 5th Sunwing flight I've taken and this is the 5th time I'm supposed to be boarding and no plane and no Sunwing staff at the gate but the board says the flights still on-time. Everyone is waiting and Sunwing says were still on-time?? On the way over I had to take my one carry on out of the overhead compartment to make room for another passenger who was sitting at the back of the planes 2 carry-ons although you allowed 1 and was asked to place my bag which I paid to have with me in a compartment between my legs. Sitting on a Sunwing plane is like taking a long ride to the state penitentiary in a police car - wouldn't hurt to remove the wood from the seats and add some padding for the prices charged, as for legroom - what legroom? I love flying but dread when I see Sunwing as my carrier. If other planes went to these places I'd take 4 layovers instead of a direct Sunwing flight!

### "Who wants to deal with Sunwing again"
Flight WG410 on October 8th from Toronto to Puerto Plata. After 2.5 hours in the air, the captain announced that the plane is needing repair and we are going back to Toronto. The return time will be 1.5 hours. The plane was old (still with ashtrays) and with  uncomfortable seats. So, instead to continue the flight to Dominican which was 1.5 hours away too, they decided to go back to Toronto. After returning to Toronto and spending 3 hours in the airport, they send us back on the same plane to Puerto Plata. We arrived to the resort at 10 pm instead of 2 pm. For all this problems, they gave a $20 voucher for the food in Toronto and $100 for the next vacation or excursion with Sunwing. Who wants to deal with Sunwing again after this? After the vacation, I sent the official complain to Sunwing and after 4 days, I still did not get any reply nor acknowledgment from them.

### "Worst seats ever"
Not Verified |  Bucket of bolts old 737! Five hour flights each way. Worst seats ever had as too worn out and uncomfortable! Coffee was cold and tasteless. Ran out of coffee eventually! Staff good. Good flight and on time as to the travel portion.

### "They were actually removing bags off the plane"
Sunwing holiday Sept 17 to Sept 24, 2019. The scheduled departure time was 3.40 pm. About 15 minutes before boarding, it was decided to weigh every passenger before boarding. Once without the carry-on and then again with the carry-on. This process must have taken well over an hour past departure time. Then we were told that they needed to rearrange the bags in the cargo section. They were actually removing bags off the plane. We were quite nervous as both our bags were removed on a previous Sunwing flight. We finally took off around 5.15 pm. The purchased food service started from the front of the plane. We were seated in row 10. They ran out of our choices by the time they came to us. Holguin. By the time we arrived in Holguin, it was pitch dark and we would be driving for over an hour to get to our hotel. We drove in total darkness for over an hour and got to out hotel just before midnight. Our travel agent had given us the heads up about this and at the time we did not think much about this. My heart goes out to the passengers who had to go on to Cayo Coco. I would advise elderly passengers and those with children to stay away from this flight.

### "Awful customer service"
Not Verified | Calgary to Varadero. First time flying with Sunwing, woke up at 4:20am anticipating our departure was at 8:50am, Sunwing delayed our departure time to 11:40am, a three hour delay, ridiculous. Won't be flying with them ever again. Awful customer service also.

### "never again on this truly terrible airline"
Not Verified |  Calgary to Varadero with Sunwing Airlines. The outbound flight included a wedding party who were already drunk when boarding. The flight crew continued to endlessly sell them alcohol through the flight. This group was ignorant, disruptive, and swore endlessly. We were lucky they were not in our hotel. On the return sure enough there they were, same behaviour. We were over 3 hours late leaving, but then the plane had to turn back from the taxiway to eject 2 of these passengers. This was the only time the crew actually did something resembling their job. We always fly WestJet, but they don’t go direct to Varadero. Needless to say, never again on this truly terrible airline.

### "They change the flight times"
Not Verified |  Saskatoon to Varadero. I am complaining about my up coming trip in November. That have no consideration about people that have to have flight transfers. They change the flight times whenever they want. Know I had to pay extra for. New flight back to Saskatoon since I’m flying out of Toronto. Also I never had to pay for hotel rooms on the way there on way back. Now I have to get a room the day before I leave because I’m not leaving at 6:00am now it’s 10:00am. I was to land at 3:15 in afternoon and I had booked my connecting flight back at 9:15. Well so much for that know I have to book a flight the next day because they changed the return time from Cuba till 7 at night. I plan my trips on a budget and now their time change is costing me over my budget.

### "disappointed with the services"
Toronto to Puerto Plata. I am very disappointed with the services that I experienced with Sunwing. Originally my flight was direct and then it was changed 4 different times and now we had to make a drop off and pick up. But before all that we found out last minute that the flight was delayed an hour.. ok fine, so instead of leaving at 11am we are leaving at 12pm. at the airport it was very unorganized, no one knew what was going on and it was now 12:20pm i had to ask a sunwing rep what was going on and she didnt have an answer she said that they dont even know whats going on. So now 12:30 they start boarding, but not kids and elders first. Just everyone go in and find your seat.. when i got in there was a couple sitting in my seat. They told me that they are sitting there because other people were in there seats. So i had to sit anywhere and put my luggage far away because all cabins near my seat were full. it was so unorganized and people putting their luggage anywhere flight attendants asking people to sit somewhere else so that the families of 3 can sit together.. that alone delayed us from leaving sooner. Now we left and arrived in punta cana and i was able to get my luggage and move it to my original seat. But now some people who boarded the plane had others in their seats. We ended up sitting in the plane for roughly 2 hours , it was freezing and finally they shut off the A/C. i didnt want to sleep and not know what was going on so i tried to stay up.. it was only until an hour and half they started serving warm water to us. And then there was an announcement that the airplane was to heavy with supplies or luggage at the front of the plane so they have to shift it, so i wasnt sure if that was the real reason but that took another 40 mins. At this point im starting to get hungry. Finally sometime after 5pm we were back in the air. We were not giving any complimentary snacks but told we can purchase food but the macaroni and cheese was not an option and why would i want to buy overpriced food after all of that waiting and inconvenience. We didnt get to the airport until 9:30pm.. so ridiculous. The worst service and flying experience.

### "Terrible service"
Not Verified |  Horrible service. I booked back in march when it was buy one get one 50%, 862$ we booked our airbnb and bought tickets to our anniversary party. In May i get an email telling me Sunwing flight is no longer operating the flight, to call immediately to arrange another day or refund with vouchers for future flights. I called right away the guy was rude - his response no flights, a refund as been issued. I was so upset we lost money on airbnb and our tickets were non refundable, to buy with another airline was now 700 extra and we didnt have it. I contacted customer service, they acted like the email didn't exist that i cancelled the flight myself. Fast forward to now. I have found out Sunwing is indeed operating from St john's to Toronto. When i contacted them again they gave me the run around again saying i cancelled. this company is horrible. People rely on them and they work hard to save. Terrible service.

### "the Sunwing policy is to delay"
Not Verified |  Firstly let me say that my wife and I fly a couple of times a year to Cuba and Sunwing is our usual airline of choice. Typically we have no complaints and enjoy the service that Sunwing offers , as they have always been good to us. In saying that we did have an issue on the return trip of our last vacation (departing May 11, 2019 ). Ever since our return I have been in constant contact with Sunwing attempting to receive an explanation to their policy as to the seating of overweight passengers. Now I understand the issue that there are passengers with weight problems and I am sympathetic however this should not be at inconvenience of other passengers. On our flight to Cuba we had no issues. On the bus to the resort there was a very large couple sitting in a row each. That was fine. On our return flight this couple were offered seats in the front row of the plane. We were seated in Row 2. The husband was assigned the aisle seat and the wife assigned the aisle seat opposite. For some reason she could be sit in this oversize seat. The stewardess asked if anybody wanted to switch seats with her and the tiny woman in the aisle seat next to me said sure (and I don't blame her ). Long story short the wife sat next to me and I was basically left with half seat for the trip home. Extremely uncomfortable to say the least. Since returning I have been in constant contact with Sunwing for a explanation and policy in the seating of obese passengers and the effect on other fare paying passengers. I have received 3 replies from Sunwing . All very apologetic but saying nothing that they will look into it and get back to me. I think the Sunwing policy is to delay, delay, delay till the complainant gives up. Any thoughts as to what I do to get them to respond?

### "The worst airlines I’ve been on"
Not Verified |  Toronto to Punta Cana. The worst airlines I’ve been on. They tell us after we boarded the plane that they are having problems with the ac. From a 12 hr delay we have been sitting on the plane making it another 2 hours. We not only had a bad flight there, but we missed a day and a half of our trip due to Sunwing's unprofessional aircraft with no compensation. It would have been cheaper to book a 6 day trip yet we paid full and didn’t get our money’s worth. 200$ voucher is ridiculous. For such an inconvenience of a short notice delay to an extended delay they should compensate us fully with a refund, policy aside. I felt bad for the elderly in our plane. Never again.

### "Horrible experience"
Montreal to Cancun. WG517-WG518 Horrible experience. We have booked direct flights since we travel with 2 young kids. 3 weeks prior to departure, we received an email indicating that our returning itinerary had been changed. There will be a stop in Toronto?! 06.17.2019 Montreal to Cancun flight: 3.5 hours delay. Never ever have we experienced it with other airlines. The Sunwing employee said our 9h10am flight had an engine “problem” and they have to wait for a functioning one to come. She added they cannot give us the Elite Plus seats we have paid for since she doesn’t know the configuration of the new airplane. 3.5 hours later we went in the airplane and realized there were some passengers from Toronto who are already in it! They were all looking unhappy since they were forced to stop at the YUL airport to pick all passengers from Montreal. 06.24. 2019 Returning flight (Cancun to Montreal with a stop in Toronto): Our 2:25pm flight was delayed to 7:50pm. When we arrived at the airport, the flight was delayed again to 9pm. No explanation from Sunwing. With a stop in Toronto, we arrived at 4am on 06.25.2019 in Montreal! Sunwing is now renting Eastern Airlines airplanes. The airplanes are very old. The seats are broken and uncomfortable. The smell is unbearable. I have read similar reviews from other passengers in social media concerning Sunwing. It looks like our situation was not unique. Strange, not the same flights, not the same destination, not the same dates but very similar situations. I let you think about it.

### "This service is terrible"
Not Verified |  
Not sure why I scheduled a 6.15am flight. Currently sitting on the runway and its 6.45 am. The pilot is blaming us the passengers that we didn't board on time when they had come on the cabin speaker at 6.25 saying boarding was complete. This service is terrible. I never really choose Sunwing, it's as if the only flights available when I am trying to leave are via Sunwing. I never look forward, or have looked forward to flying with them. No employee has any manners, and often speak to people as if they're from another planet, its bothersome how rude/embarrassing it is considering Toronto is a world class city. Too bad Sunwing is not up to these standards. You'd be better off on a raft anywhere you go.

### "never fly Sunwing again"
Not Verified |  Toronto to Varadero. Paid for an earlier return flight, my ticket confirmed our flight. While iat the resort I went to check our pickup time and found out that our 10::15 am flight was canceled and we were booked on a 21:15 flight. We didn't want to leave so late. I've asked for a refund and was told nothing doing. They reserve the right to change flights and those of us who paid for this service do not get a refund. Will never fly Sunwing again.

### "does not sell non stop flight"
Montreal to Antigua. Sunwing be careful to what you are agreeing to and their flight definitions. This year we planned our vacation early. We found what we thought were non stop short flights to an amazing island. We were happy. Then came an email from Sunwing last week with changes. A stop in Toronto and three more hours of travelling time. We will be travelling in August so at this point they can change our schedule multiple time. We have been in contact with their Sunwing cares department and here are their explanations when we told them it was not a schedule change but an itinerary change due to the extra stop. Sunwing does not accept responsibility for lost wages, missed holiday time or any other additional expenses incurred as a result of changes in flight times. Sunwing does not sell non stop flight at this moment.To further explain flight terms, a direct flight is a flight between point A and B, which may include a stop-over. A stop-over may be used to pick up new passengers or allow some to disembark, while the other stay on the plane. Direct flights are often mistaken with non-stop flights, which are flights involving no intermediate stops" "Sunwing is a chartered airline company, the flight times are subject to change and operational changes can occur, which may result in the need to reschedule, cancel, or consolidate flights. In your case, unfortunately, your flight time was changed. Please note that the possibility of this change is part of the terms and conditions that must be agreed upon prior prior to a booking being made" After several emails they gave us an the right to change our destination. However when trying to clarify what that really meant, here is what we received: "However, please note that in changing destinations, there is the possibility that your flight times could change again. please note that when changing destinations, there is an administration fee and you'd also have to pay current system rates per person. Although you are not forced to find something of the same value, kindly note that if you were to choose something of a lesser value, we would be keeping the higher rate between both vacations". Learn from our mistake and be vigilant. Know exactly what you are agreeing to. This company seems to be misleading clients into thinking they offer non stop flights which they are not. Then they try to be generous with their customers by providing them a way to spend more money with them.

### "they can do nothing"
Not Verified |  Toronto to Vancouver. This is the worst service I have ever had. I booked the flight time at 8pm almost 2 months ago but 7 days before I leave, Sunwing just sent me an email said they have changed my time from 8pm to 6am! That is totally unacceptable! I called them but they said this is the only time they have that day and they can do nothing to change my flight. They didn't even give me a reason why they change my flight time in such a early time! This is really disgusting and awful. I will never take this flight again.

### "delays delays delays"
Montreal to Santa Clara. Awful service, delays delays delays. The Montreal airport staff for Sunwing is beyond incompetent. Communication is hard and confused staff. Lack of a smile and greetings. No screen or food on board. The cheapest of the cheaps.

### "Disgusting customer service"
Not Verified |  Booked a simple weekend trip to Vancouver to see family, leaving Friday evening, returning Monday early morning to avoid missing any work. Sunwing Airlines proceeded to change our flight to extremely early Friday morning and very late Monday night. When called they advised me that we agreed to flight time changes and there was nothing they could do for us. Disgusting customer service, they gave us what they call a "premium" upgrade and were so gracious as to let us choose to sit together on our flights. Word to the wise pay a bit more and book with someone else. I will say it again, never make the mistake of booking with this 'travel' company.

### "mismanaged, incompetent"
Punta Cana to Toronto. If you’re thinking of booking a flight with Sunwing Airlines don’t! They are the most mismanaged, incompetent airline. The flight was supposed to land in Toronto from Punta Cana at 4:15pm today. Rescheduled to 6:38pm. Then on the day of the flight rescheduled again to taking off at 7:30pm landing here in Toronto at 12:30 am Monday morning. Then rescheduled once more... now landing at 1:30am. To say I’m furious is an understatement. It’s like they’re flying a bus and just keep delaying to take on more passengers.

### "flight is cancelled"
Not Verified |  Toronto to Mexico. Booked my trip 2 months ago with sunwing to Mexico June 1 2019. Departure time 6:15am. We got a call just 12 hours before departure telling us flight is cancelled and can reschedule for the Next day June 2. Fine. But now sitting here wondering what next. So many reviews on here about flight changes, cancellations and inconveniences. Not even sure if I will be relaxed on my vacation worrying about how I’m getting back home! Now that is if the new date and time does not change.

### "unacceptable to be treated this way"
Our flight from Puerto Vallarta (PVR) to Vancouver (YVR) has been changed from Sunday 8:15 PM to 7:30 AM (12:45 hours in advance) and this has cause me and my husband to shorter my paid vacation by 1 day. We have been forced to wake up at 2 AM on Sunday morning in order to take the transportation to the airport. It is unacceptable to be treated in this way since nobody has even informed us that the flight has been changed and we've found out the news from other people in the pool. We were very close to miss our flight that day. Therefore , it is the airline responsibility to reimburse us for the time and money lost since our dream vacation has been ruined .

### "delayed for 6hrs"
Not Verified |  Toronto to Punta Cana. It's one thing to have a flight delayed for 2hrs but to have it delayed for 6hrs and not keeping passengers updated is another thing all together. This is our 3rd trip with Sunwing in the last 4 years and we have not had any complains in the past. The service provided this time was quiet unacceptable especially at the beginning of a vacation that we paid a lot of money for. Still waiting for a "Sunwing Cares" rep to contact me. It's been over 3 weeks. I have family and friends that refuse to fly with Sunwing and have chosen other airlines.

### "not given what I paid for"
Not Verified |  Toronto to Cancun. Paid for Elite Plus and since they overbooked my seats, I was given another seat which was broken with the leg rest permanently up, going against all safety regulations, not to mention not given what I paid for. Leaving the resort, the shuttle bus did not show up until 1.5hours after the designated time. Meanwhile, no communication was made to the passengers about the delay and when we called from the resort, they lied to us saying first the bus was running late, then it broke down and then it would come at 8:40 am and showed up at 9 am. We arrived at the airport by a miracle, being the last ones to board the plane. When I asked Sunwing via social media what their policy was regarding "delayed buses" (because we strongly believe they just forgot about us and simply did not schedule a pick-up), they said "we do our best to get the transfer bus there as quickly as possible and try to keep passengers informed on what's happening through the destination representative at the resort" Love the world "try", not to mention there was no representative in sight at the resort. In fact, their competitor representatives were all advising us to take a taxi because we would miss our flight. Looking at their social media accounts, I've seen that many people had to indeed pay out of their pockets for a shuttle transfer to the airport because the buses were simply a no-show. Very unprofessional and should not be able to offer all-inclusive packages when they cannot live up to the expectations and required responsibilities.

### "never fly with Sunwing again"
Toronto to Varadero. Will never fly with Sunwing again. This was my 3rd trip down south in 1 year and the worst ever. 1 week before we were set to leave on a direct flight we were advised our return trip would have an extra stop, adding 3 hours to our travel home. Second, our departure from Toronto was delayed 2 hours and on our return to Toronto we were again delayed 3 hours. We had book a huge suite for our arrival home and only got to spend 4 hours in it. Really frustrating. Get it together sunwing.

### "not recommend this airline"
To start, a week before my trip I got a notice that my flight into Cayo Coco is delayed by 9 hours and was offered $50 coupon (4 passengers on booking). The check in assistant didn't print my wife's ticket and I had to go back to get it printed again. I asked about my voucher and was told it would be at the gate. Gate agent said the flight was never delayed and that she doesn't know anything about a voucher. She gave me a really hard time talking to her manager who also said would not be able to come down to talk to me or get me a voucher even though I had an email stating I should be getting one. Gate agent was rude and told me she's not authorized to tell me her name and kept covering her badge. She told me I have to talk to booking to get my voucher. While talking to booking I was told that I can only make a complaint after my trip. Finally the gate agents manager requested that I go outside security to go and request a voucher. With 20 minutes to boarding I told her that I've had enough of being put through all the runaround and I'm not missing my flight. The agent was adiment about getting my name so I told her that im done and if she wants my name she will have to give me hers, she refused. Seats were terrible, my butt still hurts till today, and the headrest was digging into my shoulders as it was too low for a guy that's 6'4". Never again, I would not recommend this airline or the products they offer.

### "cancel flights on short notice"
I understand that Sunwing "charter" can cancel flights on short notice (note terms and conditions permit any schedule changes up to 12-hours prior to flight). However, this should be a rare event (as reliability for most airlines is important). If it's too frequent it makes their schedules and bookings are effectively meaningless (but if you as a customer want to change your flight you pay a massive cancellation fees). Only book with this airline if you are OK random and substantial schedule changes. What is not OK is for Sunwing to cancel flights and not tell either their own customer service staff or customers immediately. When contacting their customer service agents they pretend/think/believe flights are still scheduled (eg. YVR-YYZ JUune 7 7, 2019). Contacted customers service twice and both times stated flight was still going - despite cancelled prior to Monday May 20. You have to then demand the customer service staff check and tell them you know the flights been cancelled before they will double check the status with Sunwing flight services/scheduling directly. At which point they confirm - yeah flight has been cancelled. It appears as though, Sunwing wont contact customers until the last minute - see other complaints (4 days prior to flight) where it is possible that Sunwing knew well before that time that the flights were cancelled / changed / rescheduled already.

### "never book with them again"
Toronto to Vancouver. Just don't bother. Booked at a reasonable price back in March. Supposed to depart Toronto at 8pm on Sunday May 26th. Today, Wednesday May 22nd, they phoned me to cancel our flight. Four days before with no explanation. They said they could reschedule is for the next available day, the 30th, 4 days later! We had to be back in Vancouver for work so obviously this wasn't going to work. They gave us a full refund, but at this point four days before departure, flights are at least three times as much. Now we have to pay at least an additional 700 dollars out of pocket. No help from customer service. Said they couldn't offer us anything more. Well that's ridiculous. If they really wanted to keep us as customers they could pay a little extra, knowing that we have to pay all that money now ourselves in order to make it back to Vancouver. They may have saved themselves a couple hundred bucks in the short term but I will never book with them again.

### "rude and impolite response"
I have booked a flight on March 31 for a round trip from Vancouver to Toronto for May 24 and return on June 02 and i paid it off full on the day of booking. Just a week before my flight on May 17 i got an email that this flights (Flight 802/807) are cancelled and you have choice to reschedule it to June 07 or get refund of your money that will take 7 business days to return to my account. .I had to be in Toronto on May 25 so i was not able to reschedule it. Suppose that if you want to get a ticket from Vancouver to Toronto just a few days of your flight it cost you fortune since i could get the same ticket two month ago that i booked Sunwing Airlines with half price. I called several times to convey my issue and concern but i only got a very rude and impolite response from the agent without any explanation and said this is what it is and go do whatever you want.

### "will never fly with them again"
Toronto to St. Lucia. Our flight to St. Lucia was supposed to leave at 11 am. The flight was delayed due to mechanical issues with no updated departure time given. Sunwing offered food vouchers for the food court which was nice but there was probably 300 or more people on the flight. We all had to line up to get these vouchers from the few Sunwing staff that were working. They then told us the flight would be delayed until 10:30 pm that night. They offered hotel vouchers for those who came from out of town. Again we had to wait in line for these. It was pure chaos. None of the staff seemed to know what was going on or how to deal with the situation. This delay threw off the entire beginning of our trip. We were exhausted after being up for 24 hours straight and we missed an entire night at our resort. Sunwing did offer us $200 vouchers for the inconvenience but when we went to use these we found out they had to convert them to USD and that we could only use 65% of it towards an excursion on our trip. The plane we flew back on was dirty, the AC stopped working at one point, the seatbelt lights and reading lights did not work at all and we were not offered a meal even though the flight was over dinner time. I have no idea how this airline is still in business and I will never fly with them again. Spend a little more money and fly with another airline!

### "refuse to compensate us"
My wife's friend is getting married in Toronto in May of 2019. Upon hearing the news, we booked the most value flight we can find online. We thought we scored a deal with Sunwing for $700 (after fees, taxes) for both of us. Flight leaves Vancouver for Toronto on May 18 and return on May 27. A couple of weeks ago, early May, Sunwing called and said our return flight was cancelled. They gave a full refund and a $100 voucher as compensation. We did managed to find a more expensive return flight but still within our budget. Sunwing assured us that the Vancouver to Toronto is still on. Two days from our departure date, Sunwing called and now says our Vancouver to Toronto flight was cancelled. They offered a next day flight but we would miss the wedding reception. I told them that was unacceptable yet they refuse to compensate us the difference with a competitor flight. Not only that, they didn't even offer another $100 voucher for the inconvenience. The agent refused to give anything and the manager was even less helpful. They were just stone cold and probably laughing at our misfortune behind the phone. We're now paying for a much more expensive last minute flight to get to Toronto, have to book another night at a hotel, and additional day of car rental.

### "worst experience travelling"
Not Verified | We had the worst experience travelling with this joke of a airlines. We were coming home from vacation, from Punta Cana. We boarded the plane along with other 300 people. First of all, it wasn't even a Sunwing plane. Sunwing uses old planes of airlines that went out of business. Very old plane, you realize as soon as you enter it. We took our seats and plane started to move to depart, all the sudden, the lights were off and AC stopped working. Everybody on the plane went silent, 20 min later pilot informed us that the generator wasn't working, it stared to get hot on the plane. 20 more min and pilot said that problem was fixed and we can fly to Toronto now, we took off, and 15 min into the flight, pilot announcted that we were returing to Punta Cana as the navigation wasn't working. We returned to Punta, sat on the tarmac for 3-hours, pilot was scrambling to figure out what to do. After hours of waiting we had to leave, collect our luggage, and go to a hotel for the night (after literal hours and hours of waiting, to get off the plane, go thru customs again, collect luggage, board a bus to a hotel) It was a nightmare. We returned home following day and I will never fly with Sun Wing again.

### "No customer service"
Not Verified |  Upgraded to business class and was very pleased with the seats. Older but lots of leg room. Food is good no issues at all. On the way to Punta Cana the service was okay, on the way back I was shocked. No customer service at all. We were delayed an hour and I understand that happens but nobody told us why or what was going on until people started to get upset. Didn’t offer water or anything and it was very hot. I was at the front and the flight attendants all just talked to each other the whole flight ignoring people. I had to ask for water 3 times at one point and they just said okay then not get me any. No smiles, no how are you? Just rude! Maybe Sunwing should have a talk to their employees about customer service as a lot of people get high anxiety when flying and they should be very understanding and polite! I did enjoy the planes layout as it was 2 seats only so you didn’t have to sit with a stranger. Also no movies both ways, first time I’ve ever been on a plane and not have a show or movie to watch!

### "old planes with terrible service"
Not Verified |  Toronto to Punta Cana return. Flight there - plane turned around after 20 mins. Everyone unloaded and we didn't get on another plane for 6.5 hours. Delayed for an hour for the return flight. Then sat on the plane for an additional hour. Yet again engine problem. I have to stop typing because we're getting off. Without time to explain further, I'll just add old planes with terrible service. What a joke of an airline.

### "not reimbursed us for the seats"
Toronto to Punta Cana. We will never use Sunwing Travel again! We were forced to pay for another seat the following day due to my son contracting salmonella at Sunwing's resort. The aircraft had empty seats and we where promised by a Sunwing representative that this will not be an extra cost because we purchased insurance. This was all scam as they billed us for the seats anyway and kept hiding behind their policy and have not reimbursed us for the seats. Shame on you Sunwing, I will never use your services again.

### "delay for 6.5 hrs"
Miami to Toronto. First time and last time we will fly Sunwing. Flight delay for 6.5 hrs. and despite their knowledge did not robo call passengers to notify. We were freezing. I asked Sunwing Rep for blanket. She said no. Waiting 7 hours and freezing. Voucher was for 1 restaurant located outside so had to go through security again to get fed. Another delay was announced. Be transparent Sunwing.

### "they are unreliable "
Not Verified |  Our 3rd trip with Sunwing. The staff onboard were not the friendliest but the turbulence was bad and there were a lot of people that liked to use the bathroom right when the carts were in the aisle, so I get it. Our return trip was like our last, delayed. We checked out at noon and found out our flight was delayed from 21:00 to 00:50. Our bus was suppose to leave the hotel at 18:00 but changed to 2050. We checked out so couldn’t pay to keep our room (overpriced) Sunwing offered no explanation and no compensation, as usual. This is our last trip with Sunwing, they are unreliable and don’t care about their paying customers.

### "last time flying with Sunwing"
Not Verified |  Toronto to Miami. Terrible, there were technical difficulties which was fine, but we were stuck on the tarmac for 3 hours. Then they told us we could immediately get on a new airplane, and that we would load immediately. As we were getting off the plane, they told us it would take 2 hours. Those 2 hours became 4 hours and the line would not do anything to ensure we reached our destination on time. They made no effort to help us find another flight or reimburse us in any way. Not to mention that the company then left us sitting at the gate for more time. They then escorted us to baggage claim as there was nothing to be done. From there we waited another 2 hours, and they managed to lose our luggage, made us walk to the other side of the terminal twice, before finally finding our luggage. This was our first and will definitely be our last time flying with Sunwing.

### "flight that got delayed"
Calgary to Cancun. My family has been at the airport since 6:15 this morning for a flight that got delayed as we were already en route to the airport. Flight was delayed 30 minutes. Then we get a call to board the plane at 9;25 when should have already been boarded and the plane should have been taking off. Not only that, we get called to board at 9:25 and then wait 15 minutes in the breezeway (not even on the plane yet) to only have someone come into the breezeway and tell us to “walk around” because now the flight has been delayed 1 hour.

### "Will never again fly Sunwing"
Flight to Orlando boarded 1/2 hour late should have been 6.20am, delayed due to faulty generator. Sat on plane 2.5 hours returned to main terminal. Could not disembark due to faulty ramp. Flight now delayed until 3.30pm. Compensation $20 meal voucher for your 9 hour mistake/delay, your problem not mine. Will never again fly Sunwing. Will let all friends/family etc know about your problems and compensation to paying passengers

### "always had great service"
Montréal to Punta Cana. We have flown Sunwing many times over the years. Yes, the seats are a bit cramped and you have to pay for the food ; but we have always had great service from the Sunwing staff both in the air and on the ground.

### "never fly Sunwing again"
Not Verified |  Punta Cana to Calgary. We will never fly Sunwing again. The entire experience was terrible. The seats were uncomfortable, the temperature in the plane was too hot, the food was really bad and  very unwelcoming flight attendants. This was the worst flight I have ever experienced. Shame on you for ruining the end of everyone’s holidays.

### "This is the worst flight"
Miami to Toronto. Departure time was delayed. Seats very uncomfortable. Something wrong with the temperature control so it was very hot throughout the flight. The food was less than adequate. We ordered the pizza and the crust was hard and sauce mushy on top. No pepperoni to be had. I ordered a wine and ended up having to get up and remind the flight attendant she owed me a wine. This is the worst flight we have taken.

### "never use Sunwing again"
We had tickets for 4 leaving from April 13th 2019 but had a sudden accidental death in the family and had to cancel. We reached out to Sunwing toll free number to explain the situation and ask for refund or voucher for later date on April 5th. We spoke to agent who promptly said there was nothing they could do no refund no voucher nothing. All they could ask is for cancellation which seats would be filled no problem with last min deals and you can fill your pockets with more money. This is outrageous that in case of accident or death we cannot even get a voucher or refund of some kind. We can provide a death certificate if need be not trying to pull a scam. No need for voucher I will never use Sunwing again and will make sure all our family hears about the insensitivity of your airline in such a tragic time.

### "customer service is horrible"
Detroit to Montego Bay. Going to Montego Bay went smoothly. Coming back we had to stop in Cincinnati and go through customs. Originally I did not check my bag but being that I stopped in duty free in Jamaica I had to check them in Cincinnati. Made it home to Detroit, a 45 minute flight and my bag didn't come with the plane. Since DTW is not a home base for Sunwing there was no ive to speak with in person. Called the number, was on hold off and on for over an hour and then got hung up on. Tried calling back after sitting in the airport for an hour and a half and no response. I've never had anything like this happen. The customer service is horrible, they have no idea what to do. After googling lost luggage with Sunwing I found a different number and called that and they want you to fill out a claim form that didn't recognize my booking number. Just horrible, ended up leaving a message for someone to call me back, we shall see..

### "an issue being on time"
Toronto to Cayo Coco. My husband and I went to Cuba on March 19th. We flew with Sunwing and it was a huge ordeal going there and back. We returned on March 28th. I checked the flight going there and everything seemed fine. We didn't take off until an hour after our flight was supposed to. No explanation except that I think the airplane we were supposed to take arrived late. No apology. My time is valuable. It's like a doctor that holds you up and acts like it's no big deal. Coming back was worse. I checked the time and we were supposed to take off at 8:45 and land in Toronto around midnight. We had arranged for our son to pick us up. We waited and waited. We finally took off 2 hours after we were supposed to. Again just another brief apology because the airplane had arrived late in Toronto which put them behind in schedule. Again, no one told us anything. Sunwing seems to have an issue being on time. Because it was so late and my son had to work the next day, we told him to stay home and we would take a cab which was $100.00. We didn't land until 2 am, again no consideration for my time. We were all crushed in the plane like sardines. We were at the back of the plane. The lady beside me couldn't move her legs because the person in front of her reclined his seat. I'm very disappointed with the experience. We have used Sunwing for a long time. After this experience we won't be using it again. The relaxation my husband and I felt after our trip faded quickly after this horrible flight home. There was no offer of a voucher at all. We weren't even informed as to how late our flight was. You need to be realistic about your flight times.

### "Disgusting service"
Not Verified |  Boarded our flight to leave Mexico, everything was fine except for the ridiculously slow service at check in and the long line up. Once we landed in Calgary we were told to get off the plane and go thru customs as this was a surprise to everyone who were told that we would fly direct to Edmonton. Once done customs we were told the flight would be delayed 5 hours and gave everyone a 15$ food voucher that was useless as all food venues were closed in the middle of the night. Sunwing new about the flight change and did it deliberately to split the plane ride between 2 diff groups. Disgusting service.

### "staff were very friendly"
Toronto to Liberia return on Sunwing Airlines. While going only one washroom worked. The staff were very friendly and helpful, but do not expect 5 star rating in these economy flights

### "attendants did nothing"
Not Verified |  I’ll start with the flight. Our flight took off at 5:45pm and we landed in Cuba after 1am. We paid extra for the elite plus package. The 3rd row we had on the way down was ideal. We got the first row on the way back, it was the worst, you couldn’t move the arm rest and it’s annoying to have no place to put your bags. On the way down, we had a rowdy, loud couple who never stopped talking. It was annoying until around 11pm and just ignorant after that as it would have been nice to have a little nap given we weren’t getting to our hotel until 3-4am. The flight attendants did nothing to get them to be quiet, rather, they participated in the shenanigans. If I had my kids with me, I would have been extremely upset. On the way back, the same couple was on the plane and were still talking the whole way home. We left Cuba after 3am so everyone wanted to sleep and these people never shut up. Again, no one from sunwing said anything to them. Grow a back bone for your other passengers flight comfort and say something to these people please! As for the resort, it was amazing. However, Sunwing was paid by us for a 7 day stay. We really got more like 6 and a few hours because of the time our flight came in. I would recommend you ask Sunwing about this. Our check in time for our resort was 3pm March 2nd. We hadn’t even left Edmonton until 5:45pm that same day. Our flight home was at 3:35am on March 10th. We had to vacate our room at 12pm on March 9th meaning we had no room to stay in for 11 hours before the bus came to take us to the airport. When we spoke to the resort, they said sometimes when Sunwing does this, they pay for the room or negotiate late check out. They did nothing of the sort. The resort however took care of us and we checked out at 4pm and were offered a courtesy room in case we wanted to freshen up before the flight. That was 100% because we spoke to a wonderful man named Oscar who helps run the resort. When I went to the front desk, they basically said that’s what sunwing paid for so if we hadn’t found Oscar, we would have been screwed. I’ve stayed once in Cuba before and had the exact same flight situation but we got to keep our room until we left. This is why I will book through that company in the future. I’ve had so many issues with Sunwing that I haven’t booked with them in 4 years and I never will again. They’re the worst!

### " Everything was perfect"
Not Verified |  We were very nervous about all this negative reviews about Sunwing and Vacation Express. Everything was perfect! We was greeted at the airport from Vacation Express representative and asked if we have any questions. The airplane was right on time transfers at the airport went smooth and what more can you expect?! We had a great time! Thank you!

### "never recommend this airline"
Regina to Puerto Plata. Our destination and return flights were both delayed. The destination flight delay was blamed on weather from our fly out location- even though other airlines were still able to fly out of the airport. Our return flight was delayed by 10 hours and multiple reasons were provided but none verified. Sunwing never took any of the blame and did not have any communication with any of the passengers. They had re routed us without letting us know. And we had to make an additional stop to get more fuel. I have never had any issues flying before and I have been on over 50 flights. This was by far this worst experience I’ve had. Terrible communication. My review is delayed because I have sunwing a chance to try to correct this mistake by contacting their customer service. They refused to take any of the blame and were extremely unhelpful. I would never recommend this airline or fly with them again.

### "Little to no info from Sunwing"
Edmonton to Zihuatanejo. Leaving Edmonton, check in was unorganized, understaffed, and ridiculously slow. Boarding was late, probably due to terrible check in as well. Plane on way back ran out of fuel and had to divert to Calgary. Little to no info from Sunwing handed out. Told there was a rep and baggage carousel, nope, had to go through Customs, and still no Sunwing rep. Calgary white hat people were trying to help but it was obvious they knew it was Sunwing and they would be dealing with it. Was told to go back to departures and wait there. Waited close to an hour with still no rep in sight. Got frustrated and went and booked a WestJet flight instead to get home. I understand that mistakes can be made (running out of fuel) but to have nobody helping or assisting customers on a mistake made by your Airline is totally unacceptable. Sunwing is a low budget Airline cutting corners and should be avoided as they see no value in assisting customers. Flight was originally set for 20:45 in YEG, landed in YYC instead, and found out later delayed until 10:45 next morning for YEG. I am sure that would have been a fun night with maybe 5 hrs sleep for the families and other customers. Not sure if they got a hotel or had to stay in Airport. Was not waiting to find out as it was after 10:30 and no Sunwing rep in sight yet, with a full plane of customers waiting in line to talk to rep when they showed up.

### "flight was awesome"
Not Verified |  Toronto to Holguin. My two daughters and I flew with Sunwing the week of Feb 17/ 2019, the service and flight was awesome, the staff was wonderful and very polite, the flight both ways were very nice with absolutely no issues. We will fly Sunwing again without any hesitations. Thanks Sunwing for the awesome flight.

### "the image of incompetence"
We had a very poor experience flying with Sunwing. We were to fly from Toronto to Cayo Coco on January 28th, however, thanks to the snow storm the plane was delayed and delayed until finally cancelled until the next morning at about 930 pm. We appreciated the food vouchers, but it was frustrating to have the delays continue until it was so late it was going to be very challenging to leave. We ended up staying at the airport. The next morning at 3 am for check in, we were told by one staff member to check in in a particular line (we had an infant and stroller), then were told something else by another Sunwing staff. The lack of cohesive messaging and communication was probably the most frustrating, as we understand the reason for the delay but it just did not seem like the staff knew what they were doing. Furthermore, I later discovered that my luggage was sent on a different flight to Cuba so I thought it was missing but then we found it in the lost and found at the airport. Not a good feeling to think your luggage is lost after being up all night with a baby and knowing your vacation at that point could be ruined. Thankfully it was there at the airport but I wonder how that happened. On the way home, we experienced more delays as passengers were all loaded and then we had to wait while they vetted and then removed a drunk passenger from the plane. We also had a stop over in Cienfuegos, and as my husband had pointed out, both to and from Cuba the flights booked were both originally direct so again not sure how that happened. For us the issue was not the uncontrollables, it was the image of incompetence and lack of strong training and organization evident among the staff. If you talked to two different people you had two different messages, or heard I don't know. That does not help frustrated passengers waiting for information. I strongly recommend these issues be addressed starting at the top or these reviews will only continue to be bleak, sadly.

### "not deal with them again"
Edmonton to Cancun. Sunwing cannot or will not take care of a problem for the life of them. A very poor experience my first and last experience booking with them. A party of 10 of us flew to Playa Del Carmen for a wedding & flight was delayed then when we got to hotel we were not booked in til a day later. We were travelling with a 1.5 yr old baby who was hungry & tired since we had to wait for 2 hours before hotel found us a room. We were not put into rooms we paid for but put into standard rooms. We had to meet up with their rep at the hotel the next morning and said he would have an answer at 3 pm for us then at 3 pm he wanted us to stay put in the charity room we were put in the night before till the next day as the office is not open on Sundays. No accountability from Sunwing nor hotel but each blaming the other for a mistake that clearly is not our own as our reservations were made in November. Our other family used WestJet & had no problems. I am sorry we gave Sunwing our business (party of 10) of about $20,000. Very very disappointing & they don’t even care enough to see if our problem has been dealt with satisfactorily. Will not deal with them again!

### "has been the worst experience"
Not Verified |  Edmonton to Liberia via Calgary. I booked this vacation without reviewing Sunwing, this was my first mistake. Many of the concerns and issues raised by previous reviewers are unfortunately very accurate. This airline did not know connecting times in Calgary and couldn't issue both boarding passes. When asked, the response was "you will need to figure it out in Calgary". Not a good impression from the extremely unhelpful staff in Edmonton. The flight was delayed, apparently this is very common according to Sunwing staff. They also cancelled a Vancouver flight and caused multiple issues with double seat bookings and frustrations with other passengers. No power source to charge devices, no screens on the TV for the kids. We were advised that we could order food from the menu on board prior to boarding, and again at the beginning of the flight, only to find out most items are not on board unless you ordered way in advance (we tried to order Sandwiches for the kids). I am 6'1", my knees were pressed into the seat the whole trip. When the passenger in front attempted to recline, it became unbearable and they were unable to recline as a result. As we were on the back row, we were also unable to recline. As a regular flyer, it has been the worst experience on any airline ever and I have flown throughout the world on many low budget airlines. The staff are obviously left to deal with this regularly which clearly shows with the low level of enthusiasm throughout. Unfortunately my first and last time with this airline. It has definitely put a disappointing mark on our vacation. I would not recommend this airline, very disappointing!

### "no drinks, snacks, or a blanket "
On our original flight from Toronto to Punta Cana, our flight was delayed numerous times and I did not receive any notification from the airline. On the way home, our flight was delayed over 13 hours. I can’t completely blame Sunwing as the weather was pretty bad in Canada at the time. That being said, they did not do anything to accommodate us for our troubles - no drinks, snacks, or even a blanket as our day flight at 1pm was moved to 2:30am - which was disappointing. Lastly, and this is the big one for me, our aircraft was so cold that there was actually ice forming inside of the plane under the window - see photo.

### "final time I fly Sunwing"
Not Verified | Punta Cana to Toronto. This will be the final time I fly Sunwing unless they change their unloading zones. I, nor the infants that are on the same flight should be subjected to a 50 degree swing in temperature as well as being forced to take a 10 to 15 minute bus ride to terminal. We pay good money. Don't take us for granted. Change or lose!

### "one of the worst experiences"
My boyfriend and I and 2 other couples traveled from Toronto to Punta Cana on Jan 25th. Before the departure date, the departure time had already been delayed. Once we arrived to the airport the flight was delayed again. Coming home, we were supposed to depart Punta Cana at 5.30pm. They flight was delayed until 1.50am and we didn’t end up in the air until 2.30am. We landed at 5.30am and our luggage was not available until 7.30am. This was one of the worst experiences I’ve had traveling.

### "late communication of delays"
Toronto Pearson to Punta Cana. I rarely fly on Sunwing and now I remember why. Very old aircraft. No entertainment system in-seat. They show about 45 mins of Sunwing ads then shows like Big Bang Theory, Young Sheldon, Modern Family etc. which aren't really appropriate for kids my childrens' ages. On the way down from YKF-PUJ, we didn't get a snack at all. On the way home, we got biscuits. They didn't have many vegetarian options for buying food, and on the way back were out of the top 3 most popular meals. Both flights there and back were delayed, neither was really Sunwing's fault as it was weather-related in Canada. But the issue lies with their non-existent and late communication of the delays. Their app is useless- it's really only for booking. I signed up for their text and email notification, and neither has any gate information. The emails and texts also come way too late, they need to update far more frequently. I found out more from other passengers and from the website tracking the incoming flight than from Sunwing themselves. That's pretty bad. Sunwing also had no capability to do online check-in on the way there or the way back. They also only print physical boarding passes and do not have this on an app. So they are years behind other carriers (ex Air Canada) with that sort of customer convenience stuff. At PUJ, we also had no idea what gate to go to as it wasn't on the notice screens for hours, then it showed up and changed a few times. The whole PUJ experience was a cluster #^$% coming home, most of which probably lies with that airport and not necessarily with Sunwing. The only reason I booked this flight with Sunwing is because it was flying direct from YKF. Otherwise I would have 100% chosen another carrier.

### "poor communication"
Toronto to Liberia (Costa Rica). Have flown with Sunwing a few times now and every time there seems to be a delay. This time when we left Costa Rica we had to touch down in Cancun to add more fuel for our trip home causing a couple more hours of flight time to our trip home to Toronto. Reason was the plane was to heavy to Accommodate the winds on the runway they had to use. If it’s a full flight and they know this prior to and for sure day of why couldn’t they arrange the runway that would allow them to fly out. I believe they had a full plane with lots of luggage I know we paid for the extra luggage as well as our friends and I’m sure many others did as well and this was pre arranged prior to flight. Thought they could of had a movie for us on our way home but only played TV shows like old reruns of Big Bang and other shows. No complimentary drink or food. Once we arrived to airport they couldn’t pull in to our terminal then causing a bus ride 15 minutes or so to our terminal once we all piled out the doors wouldn’t open for us to enter the building and it was freezing cold outside with high winds, finally after several minutes they opened the doors for us so we could then fill out custom forms. Once we completed the process we went to pick up our luggage where we waited again for the first piece of luggage to drop but remember we flew into terminal 1 and needed to go to terminal 3 as did our luggage. No explanation at all why this was happening very poor communication. Always find there to be a delay with Sunwing with poor to little communication to it’s passengers.

### "Would not recommend"
Toronto to Cancun. Flight was by more than one hour late. There was no room for legs. One washroom did not work. However the worst was a Sunwing representatives in a hotel. We were given time to meet at 1 pm. We waited for half an hour. Then someone told us that a guy may come at 4. He did. He took our transfer ticket and said to come today, Thursday January 10 at 4 pm to get information on time of transfer to airport. We waited from 3:45 pm to 4:20 pm and nobody came. We will take a taxi cab and plan to request Sunwing to compensate price with discomfort we have experienced. Would not recommend, so unreliable service.

### "a nightmare from hell"
This by far is the worst experience i had to go through. I booked a very expensive all inclusive trip to Cuba with Sunwing for December 30 2018 to Jan 2 2019 and checked my luggage in. Bag tagged to Santa Clara. The service on WG218 was horrendous! The 2 females on flight hit my row of seating with the cart did not have manners and were very condescending to me, i tried to voice myself to the 1 gentleman and he shrugged and said simply theres nothing he could do. I arrived in Cuba and my luggage did not arrive. It did not arrive for the entire Vacation! I filed a Claim at the Airport with reassurance it will be on the next flight to Cuba and delivered Directly to my Resort. My luggage never came! The Representative  taking my report/claim never asked me specifically about the make or model of my luggage what distinct design/marks were on it. Nothing. I went on World Tracer to update all the additional information that the rep did not ask me, and it would not save. I tracked it said: 1 item found.. pending confirmation. Then the status changed to Still tracing. Every time i contact Sunwing i dont get a response, i spoke to representatives at Toronto airport and was referred to call a baggage department and got the run around. I cant speak to a person directly about my luggage! I called the airport, sent emails and voicemails, still cant get a update on my lost baggage. This is unbelievable. I dont feel valued. On the return home, the flight WG301 was delayed 2 times we were supposed to depart at 8:50pm we did not depart until 11:20pm. It totally has been a nightmare from hell and i feel like im still living it because my baggage is still lost and its been 5 days!

### "Worst travel experience"
Toronto to Punta Cana. Worst travel experience ever! Flight delayed by over 6 hrs. Compensation, $20 meal voucher. Paid a premium for an early direct flight, was the last flight of the day to leave. When it was time to leave, there were mechanical issues creating further delays. Called customer service, was on hold and took 45 minutes to be told I need to send an email. The only reason I rates them a 1 is that 0 was not an option Sunwing, never again.

### "Horrible customer service"
Not Verified | Toronto to Puerto Vallarta. Horrible customer service, overpriced food/alcoholic beverages, dirty planes, and uncomfortable seats. Find a better airline (Air Canada, WestJet, Air Transat) and stay far away from Sunwing!

### "Find yourself a better airline"
Very unorganized airline. Our departure flight from Calgary to Cancun was delayed by 5 hours as their plane mechanically had issues that they had to bring another plane from Toronto. On the way back from Cancun they had the same issue that caused to be delayed 9 hours. That tells me that their fleet is not as new. Things could easily go wrong with these guys. I do not recommend to travel with Sunwing. Find yourself a better airline that could provide high quality planes and great services.

### "pay and get nothing in return"
Rio Hata to Montreal. Paid for Elite plus seating seat 2e and 2f front seat but for take off they send us at the rear of the plane because tv not working. I presume I love to pay and get nothing in return. Paid for private transfers hotel to airport no taxi available had to paid extra for other taxi.

### "Worst service received"
Toronto to Punta Cana. Worst service received in this December, I used to travel with Sunwing in this couple of years, Cuba and Mexico no problem so far, but this time we go Dominican was a nightmare, flight delay. Okay, flight delay is not a news but the flight assistant shouted at us and said sit back and wait, I couldn't believe this flight assistant such a reply to all of us. Finally we arrived at the resort at 3:30am to the resort lobby, Sunwing forgot to inform the hotel and and there are no room for us, finally the receptionist called the resort manager and unlock the room for us, but its almost 6:00am, 7 days vacation, first 2 days was a to be recovered.

### "don't give snacks anymore"
Not Verified | Edmonton to Punta Cana via Winnipeg. The flight was 9 + hours they don't give you snacks anymore. Make you pay for your meals and it has to be with a real credit card not a prepaid . Bought a couple excursions and they where not explained well and not worth the price. On the flight back I had to pay for my checked bag because they said it was over the 23kg the eco class is alotted but we read it was 30 kg before we got there. It cost me 60$ usd. Will try very hard not to ever use Sunwing again

### "never fly with them again"
Not Verified |  Horrible experience they lost my bag which resulted in my 2 small boys and I missing my flight. My boys did not eat for 6 hours because of this and never was offered food. They did offer to comp my meal on an Air Canada flight I eventually was moved to, this came to 26 dollars which is not sufficient for the trouble we were put through it was like they didn't care at all. I will never fly with them again.

### "no food for 4 hours"
Not Verified | Toronto to Cayo Coco. They try to make money at the airport by 35$ each and put us together but we did not pay so me and my wife and 2 kids all in different seats. Second no food for 4 hours not even snack if you want something you have to pay for it. Third very bad landing in Toronto.

### "a huge disappointment"
Toronto to Montego Bay. Our holiday started with a 90 min delay for no reason as this was supposed to be the first flight of the day. We were staying in a beautiful resort but the Sunwing rep was no help at all during our vacation. Flying home the flight was delayed another 2 hours and instead of calling our hotel as promised so that we could take our time, we spent more than 5 hours waiting in Montego Bay airport. No one at Sunwing informed us of the delay or offered any type of compensation or apololgy. We had booked Elite class on the plane but this was a total waste of money as there wasn’t any room in Elite class and the plane was cramped and shabby. The inflight entertainment was ludicrous as every other airline now has an app where you can watch movies on your ipad. Not Sunwing. All in all, Sunwing was a huge disappointment and we will not be travelling with Sunwing ever again.

### "never fly this airline again"
Not Verified |  Toronto to Havana. I have had such a horrible time with Sunwing. I will never again use this Airline. I have tried repeatedly to book our seats on the plane, 12 hours prior to flight allegedly this can be done online. The online seat booking was not working so I called Sunwing to see if it could be done by the Sunwing representative. She told me that she could not access the seat booking, as they too were having technical issues with booking seats, but she told me that if I went to the airport, it could be done there immediately. We arrived at the airport at midnight. Attempted to check in and book our seats, only to find out that the representative was wrong and we could not book our seats. Does this woman not know her own job? When specifically asked ‘if we showed up at 12 am, we will be able to pick our seats?’ She states yes! I will never fly this airline again. This was the last straw. If I could pick 0 out of 10 I would.

### "Worst experience ever"
Toronto to St Pete Clearwater. Worst experience ever! My husband and I booked Sunwing for our honeymoon and we were extremely disappointed with how awful it was! Nothing but issues from the moment we arrived to the moment we got home after hours upon hours of our plane being delayed 3 times on the Monday! We will never ever book with this airline again! I wrote the Sunwing care and their email back was just list of excuses. Not once did they offer my husband and I anything. If you book with this company you may be extremely disappointed. I give this airline a 0/10 but it won’t let me score it.

### "my worst flying experience"
Vancouver to Cancun. This airline is a joke I don't even know how they are still in service. They are incredibly small and a lot less leg room than most planes. They only had two bathrooms on the whole plane so there was always 10 people in line waiting. You had to buy a blanket if you were cold. They didn't offer any snack, they were out of the food to purchase. There was no TV screen anywhere on this plane, this was by far my worst flying experience!

### "planes are dirty and old"
Edmonton to Cancun. This was my first time flying with this airline and it was by far the worst airline I have been on. The planes are dirty and old. They have no outlets for you to charge your phone - this is especially bad considering the lack of in-flight entertainment. There is no wifi for purchase. They do not offer a small free snack even on a 6 hour flight (there are basic foods for purchase but they often run out). The seats are so close together that my average height (5'10") husband could barely fit. They do offer free pop, juice, coffee, and tea(one basic tea). They have alcohol for purchase. The flight attendants were nice. The transfer at our destination was good (probably the best part of the experience). I also like that it is a Canadian airline.

### "a garbage airline"
Not Verified | It's a garbage airline. No customer service at all. Direct flight was booked feom Toronto to Orlando for 3 hrs. They changed a flight a week before and make it indirect flight and duration of arrival change from 3 hrs to 5 hrs. Return flight was delayed by exactly 8 hours and 35 minutes. They still can not get it right and flight was delayed for 30 minutes more. Tots experience was garbage. Can't accept it.

### "I think it’s a bad scam"
Ft Lauderdale to Toronto. Sunwing give his passengers a $50 survey vouchers to fill up. Only problem is, after you get it in the mail, you realize you can not use it only for a flight or only for hotel booking. And it’s only $25 a person and not $50. I think it’s a bad scam. When I’ve got the email coupon from them after few weeks. it say: “This $50 Travel Voucher may be applied to the final payment toward your purchase of travel arrangements made with SUNWING VACATIONS. Only one voucher per room booking can be applied. ($25 per person based on double or $25 on single occupancy). Applicable to vacation packages 4 nights or longer for new bookings made at least 45 days prior to the departure date. Valid for 1 year from date of issue - 11/06/2018. This voucher cannot be combined with any other promotional offers and is not redeemable for cash, is non-transferable, non-refundable, non commissionable; and not valid for air or land only or group bookings.

For your convenience, we gladly accept the voucher emailed or you may fax it to or mail the original voucher to the attention of the Accounting Department

### "attendants attentive to everyone"
Toronto to Santa Clara. My husband and I booked with Sunwing Toronto to Santa Clara (Cayo Santa Maria) leaving 3:55pm October 20th, returning October 27th, 10:30pm. This was only our second time flying Sunwing, the first back in April 2016. To be honest I was concerned after reading some of the reviews but the flight to and from was awesome! The flight attendants were amazing and were attentive to everyone, and always with a smile! Our flight leaving Toronto was boarded on time and quickly and efficiently. Our returning flight however was delayed as there was some rather bad weather in Montreal where it originated from, nothing that the airlines could be responsible for, but again, the boarding was done quickly and efficiently with the same awesome service on the return flight. I have found that a sincere smile and hello when boarding is appreciated and can make the difference to someone who might have had a difficult flight already due to some people that seem to think that a flight attendant is their own personal attendant there to do their bidding alone, not realizing or caring that there are over 100+ people on board, not just them! Kudos on the great work you do and I look forward to flying with Sunwing again.

### "gave us an excellent service"
Montreal to Cancun. Dani, the lady who served us in the luggage counter was very kind and gave us an excellent service. She saw our size and gave us great seats to make sure we will enjoy our flight.

### "have the most delays"
Toronto to Varadero. I have travelled with Sunwing’s at least five times in the past. I will never fly with Sunwing Airlines again because they not only have the most delays, but they have poor customer service and cannot compensate for their poor services. I couldn’t check in to my flight on the return flight, but that might have been because it was delayed by 5 hours, leaving me to return to Toronto at 5:00 am, stranded without a ride. I will never be giving Sunwing Airlines my money ever again. Not to mention the return flight was freezing that I had to buy a blanket. 0 out of 5 for value for money, don’t waste your money, you will be disappointed and probably have your flight delayed a couple of times!

### "ignorant customer service"
Not Verified |  Toronto to Varadero. Pretty much mediocre and careless service. I've used check-in app to get a good seat, since I'm almost 2 meters tall, so I picked seat at row 17 where emergency exit is, hoping to have extra space for legs, because picture indicates there is no seats before me. So, surprise, extra seat was mounted right at extra space. I sent email to customer service and received very generic reply back, with all details how to buy seats or upgrade to higher level. Agent didn't even care to read my complaint at all. Very careless ignorant customer service, by the way tried to switch seat on the way back, no way,must pay 30$ even if half of flight empty. I'm going to avoid this airline for sure and all my family and friends.

### "Last time Sunwing"
Booked WG 805 Toronto to Vancouver 23 July. Checked online before leaving for the airport, all OK. Went to check in an hour later, and found out flight was going to be late. Really late. They said, just under 4 hrs late - no doubt so they wouldn't be on the hook for anything. Sent us to the business office, who said they couldn't do anything and set us back to the gate. No change, no help, nothing. Flight scheduled to depart at 20:15 actually left at 02:04 the next day. Last time Sunwing - they did the same thing to us 2 years ago....

### "not been helpful whatsoever"
Not Verified |  My boyfriend and I were booked to go on an all-inclusive to Puerto Plata. The flight was originally scheduled to leave at 4.35pm and land at 8.40. The flight was initially delayed 3 hours to take off at 7.10pm. It is 7.15pm and we still have not taken off from YYZ. The wait time is unacceptable for a 4 hour flight. Secondly, the few employees that we have seen have given us nothing but attitude and have not been helpful whatsoever. Prior to check-in, I had requested assistance with the check-in machine and the two employees proceeded to spend another 5 minutes talking about her personal issues with her boyfriend. I had clearly indicated that I needed assistance. We have asked multiple employees what happened to the plane and none of them have given us answers except for the generic "it has been delayed". Overall, this was one of the worst airplane experiences. I have flown multiple times with Air Canada, EVA air, West Jet, and others, and none of them have experienced this abysmal level of service. I had hoped to have a great travel experience with my boyfriend but this is a terrible start. Do not book with Sunwing unless you have to. Here's to hoping everyone else has a better experience with this airline.

### "never book with Sunwing again"
My sister and I booked a 4 day package from Montreal to Cancun which includes flight/all inclusive hotel with transport from and to the hotel. Due to an emergency, I had to fly a day later. I called Sunwing to ask if I can move my date by one day, they said no which I accepted; after all, it was unexpected. I bought a separate flight to cancun the day after. I asked if I could get a ride from the airport to the hotel the next day, again, I was told no which I thought was unreasonable. The shuttle goes to the airport every day anyway, they could have let me get the transportation since I didn't use it the day before. So I ended up paying $47 for a taxi to the hotel. The next day I went to the sunwing representative at the resort to confirm my shuttle back to the airport on my date of departure. Freddy reassured me that they had my booking and that I was good to go. The day of the check out, to my surprise, the shuttle had my sister's name but not mine! He refused to take me to the airport even though I had confirmed it, I paid for it, he didn't want to hear anything. After I made a huge scene and made it clear that I had to get on the shuttle or I'd miss my flight, the driver let me on but only after he took down all of my details because 'he would get in trouble' To say I'm disappointed is an understatement. This was a very expensive holiday, I should have bought the flights and hotel on my own instead of going through Sunwing. My flight to Cancun with Interjet was 10 times better than my return flight with Sunwing (and cheaper might I add). When I called sunwing about the change in my outbound flight, they said they could book me a flight for $385 when I checked online, I booked interjet for $250! I will never book a holiday with Sunwing ever again! !

### "flight staff were amazing"
Vancouver to Varadero. The flight staff were amazing. I cant say enough about the way they handled the ignorant and disrespectful people that were on the flight back. They were mostly the same people if not all the same on the way back as on the way there but the way back they were rude, ignorant and just plain disrespectful. The staff handled everything exceptionally well. The Varadero airport experience for me was horrible. I was pulled aside and a security woman went through my suitcase. She didn't put everything back in it once she was done. I had to actually ask her to put all of my belongings back! Then once I get the ok to go and all was ok with my suitcase, we get to Vancouver and my suitcase was garbage. The zippers were split, the wheels were broken and gifts that were purchased were missing. There were a few others that also had their personal belongings missing. I have never had an issue like this with any other trip we have ever been on.

### "You truly get what you pay for"
Worst flight! This was my first time flying with Sunwing from Toronto to Vancouver and back. Both times we had about two hour delays. On my flight back to Toronto, we were informed that the flight was delayed because we were waiting on the crew members. The flight was delayed for two hours because the crew members were late! Unbelievable! Never flying with them again. I do not recommend Sunwing. Pay a little more and get a better flight. You truly get what you pay for.

### "not recommend this airline"
Vancouver to Toronto. Very bad service and not-polite customer service representatives. The flight is always delayed. It’s my third flight with this airline and it’s already been delayed by over an hour. I would not recommend this airline and would not use it again.

### "Not happy with the service"
Paid additional $60 for 2 adults and a child so we can sit together and in a row closest to door. As expected there's at least a 2 hour delay for this flight we are sitting on right now. Wasn't going to write a review about the delays because for the price we paid (compared to other airlines), the delay is fine, understandable. Reason is the delayed arrival of a plane from its flight from Montego Bay. However we are not pleased with the lady crew who are supposed to be helping us find and load our 2 carry on baggages. She commented we were supposed to have only one carry on. There's 3 of us! We paid for row 5 but ended up boarding very late (according to their sequence) and ended up having no spots for our bags. She asked us to find space all the way at the back! We are so tired from waiting and I believe we should be helped. Not happy with the service! There are lots of ways these cabin crew can simply do to help us board and get us going. Could have used other airlines who are better with their customers!

### "very likely 2-hour delay"
Vancouver to Toronto. Great price, but you must accept a very likely 2-hour delay. Probably one hour sitting in the un-ventilated cabin waiting for delayed passengers. From Vancouver to Toronto I waited 2 hours. They announce no delay until the very last minute, so you will not have a chance to wait out in a comfortable place like a garden near airport or home. From Toronto to Vancouver - again no advance announcement of the delay. So you come and wait in the airport where they announce one hour delay of serving the airplane. Then we boarded and waited one additional 30 minutes for the delayed passengers who got stuck with immigration control from their previous connected flight. After that it turned out that airplane engine will not stat without a machine that blows hot air into it and the machine is malfunctioning. Add another 30 minute for them to get another machine. So total 2-hour delay of which one hour in a sweat bath. On a good side: flight attendants are nice. Price is great: Vancouver to Toronto return flight 380 total after tax.

### "not flying Sunwing again"
Halifax to Cayo Coco. The staff at the counter seated me, my 12-y.o. son and my husband all over the plane, claiming they do not have 3 seats in the same row. They then mentioned they have 3 Premium Economy in the same row but i have to pay. I was forced to pay $90 so that we could sit all together. Would you seat your child with strangers while going on vacation? Not a bad way to make extra money by the airline? On the way back we had a stewardess being very rude to us. We had a night flight and she kept pushing and waking people up while squeezing through the aisles. Definitely not flying with Sunwing ever again.

### "customer service beyond pathetic"
Booked an All Inclusive to Cayo Coco. Flight returning home was supposed to leave at 9:30am. When we arrived at the resort, the following morning we overheard someone complaining their Sunwing flight had been changed so we checked with the rep and our flight had been changed to 9:30 pm. We received NO communication from Sunwing regarding this change. The day we were to leave we confirmed the flight time with the rep in the morning - at that time there were no further changes. We arrived in the hotel lobby to meet the bus only to find out the flight had been delayed again to 11:00 pm. Once at the airport it was delayed a further 2 hours. The Sunwing check in staff had no information and there was no rep available to speak to. It was bad enough they delayed our flight home more than 12 hours but the fact that we were never notified illustrates their customer service is beyond pathetic.

### "changed flights, delayed flights"
Toronto to Cancun. We paid money based on a flight we liked and both times they changed it on us and they tell you there’s nothing you can do about it. We paid extra money to leave on a Monday since we were gaining a day. If we left on the Tuesday we would have saved approximately $500. When we booked our trip our flight was initially supposed to depart Mexico at 10pm. Because of the late arrival home we booked the Tuesday off work. A few days before leaving on our trip the departure time was changed to 8pm. A day before we were supposed to leave, someone at the resort that recognized us from the plane advised us that the flight had been changed to 10:20am. Sunwing never contacted us to advise us of the change. I then went to the rep at the resort to confirm this information and to let her know how upset we were about the fact that we were being robbed of an entire day. She was not sympathetic at all and then turned around and told me how disappointed she was that our group did not book any excursions. I walked out right after because it was a conversation going nowhere. We were a group of 77 people attending a wedding. Some people were given the wrong pick up time and even missed the bus ride to the airport. When we pay and make a booking we are bound to that contact. Sunwing has constantly changed flights, delayed flights and has never given us any compensation. We had to purchase breakfast and lunch for the day. Our family member could no longer pick us up because they were still at work when we landed. Because of this we had to pay for transportation home. Not only did we pay extra money to choose this package. We ended up having to spend more money because of this change that Sunwing caused. Due to all this as well, my husband and I lost a day of work. I highly recommend you avoid booking with Sunwing. They never keep their end of the commitment and not one customer service rep cares. The total trip cost us $3500 and we could have paid $3000 if we left on the Tuesday to get the same vacation. I understand the flights are subject to change but a full day at the last minute is completely unacceptable. 1,2 or even 3 hours is okay but a whole day is robbery!!! This also happened to a group of 28 of us 3 months ago when we went to Los Cabos. They changed our flight to 5 hours earlier. Seems like they sell these packages with sweet flight times to entice people to buy and then change them at the last minute since there is nothing you can do. Classic bait and switch.

### "surprisingly very impressed"
Toronto to Los Cabos. First time flying with Sunwing and I was surprisingly very impressed! Check in was flawless. I did the web check in 4 hours prior to departure for both flights and managed to get one of the first few rows each time. Both flights were on time (the return was even a bit early!) and our resort was wonderful. All sunwing staff for extra helpful. Thank you Sunwing. I will definitely consider them again.

### "kind cool and collected"
Varadero to St John. Arrived home today had an awesome vacation through sunwing package. Stayed at the starfish Varadero for what we payed it was well worth the trip. Both ways the flight was very good. We landed in a heavy downpour and we flew out in a heavy downpour and the pilot did a great job. I would like to thank a particular member of our flight crew for putting up with the very rude and intoxicated lady in front of us, she was not only kind cool and collected but extremely polite she even apologized when she shouldn't have. The passenger was rude loud and just plan mean.

### "delayed for ten hours plus"
Toronto to Orlando. Flight delayed for ten hours plus, approximately an hour before scheduled take off. Was told they had a crew shortage “no pilot” and the individual had called in the night before reported by a Sunwing employee. Thanks for the notice and transparency. Must be some organization when it put all your eggs in one basket and have no back ups for pilots etc. All luggage was returned to passengers and we are having to tote it around the airport for seven hours. Then wait another three hours before the new scheduled departure. Fun times with children. Fellow passengers have missed their cruises etc. Just want to thank you SunWing for the whopping 35 dollars each in food vouchers. Never again.

### "still haven’t received my belongings"
I landed from a direct flight from Cuba to Toronto early morning on Sunday April 15 2018 during the time of the ice storm. At that time multiple flights were delayed and many passengers including me went home without our luggage. After one week my husband received his bag but no one called to let us know that is it going to be delivered. I still haven’t received my belongings and I am not able to leave my home because I’m waiting for my bag still. After flying with Sunwing airline I will never fly with you guys ever again.

### "organization is a disaster"
Montego Bay to Toronto. Traveled hundreds of times. My last flight with Sunwing was by far the worst experience. Arrived in Toronto April 15. Today is April 27 and still no word on where my luggage is. The issues with mother nature is understandable, but the service since has been disgusting. This organization is a disaster.

### "nothing but a money-grab"
As we were checking in for our return trip, Ixtapa to Edmonton via Calgary on Feb 15, 2018, the check-in lady at  Ixtapa airport removed my husbands passport from a plastic protective cover, scanned it, and then put it all back together again. When we arrived in Edmonton and went to do our customs declarations, we found that she had tucked the passport cover and the photo page into the plastic protective cover, and in doing so, ripped my husband's passport right through his photo. This was the first trip taken on a brand new 10-year passport, and it was  ruined. We looked up the procedure of replacing a damaged passport and discovered that it is full cost of $160 plus new photo's of $35 -- plus it requires as much information as though you've never had a passport before - far more than simply renewing an expired one. A lot of unnecessary expense and hassle. We contacted Sunwing the very next day - on Feb 16, 2018, and advised them of what had happened, and requested that they cover the cost of replacement, since it was their employee who destroyed it. It is now April 18 - beyond 2 months later. We have not had any communication with Sunwing, except an email saying that they are experiencing higher than usual volumes and their investigations are delayed. As far as the trip, we just purchased the flight only as we had our own accommodations, it was adequate. Food is nothing special. I was not impressed that Sunwing changed their policy on flights-only to exclude one free piece of baggage included in your price. Our baggage ended up costing us an additional $115 - nothing but a money-grab, for sure! It was a little bit cheaper if you pre-buy it online, as opposed to paying at the counter. We chose this flight because it was more direct than any of the other flights available (Just a drop-in to Calgary to pick up more passengers) and the price was good, even though we had to pay extra for baggage. The return flight was in a much older plane and the seating was extremely tight, but we endured and everything was on schedule. We chose this flight because it was more direct than any of the other flights available.

### "Worst experience ever"
Toronto to Varadero. Worst experience ever. Sunwing kept delaying our flight over 24 hours from Toronto to Cuba. Sat in the airport for 24 hours with no communication from ground staff. No managers on duty and the plane had a mechanical failure. They could not find a replacement plane in 24 hours. What a joke of a company. Lost two days of vacation and have no vacation to go on to. Our mistake to use Sunwing. All the airline does is offer a full refund for a flight thats 24 hours late. Beyond frustrated. No hotel stay, no blankets and no communication. Shocked at how many people still use Sunwing. Never using Sunwing again.

### "experience with Sunwing was very good"
Fort Lauderdale to Toronto. My experience with Sunwing was very good. My wife and l booked a return trip from Toronto to Fort Lauderdale in April. I had to call the Toronto office to change our dates and spoke to an agent who was extremely patient, polite, and helpful. She made a few good suggestions to help us resolve our problems and took the necessary steps including prompt return calls to make the adjustments for us. We were very impressed with her very cordial service, pleasant attitude, and readiness to help. Our flight to FLL was on time and quite pleasant. However, the flight back from FLL had few hiccups. Too many passengers had oversized carry on luggages As such, overhead cabins were full and passenger on seat 8F had to put her duffle sports bag on her lap all the way. An air hostess chided some passengers that their luggages were too big for carry on. Really? So why were they allowed and not stopped before boarding. We both only had one very small soft bag, and still had to scuffle for space on overhead cabins. By being lax on this, SunWing is not conforming to standards and not being fair to customers who follow the rules. Other than that, we were quite pleased with SunWing and will probably travel using thia airline again.

### "Overall a horrible experience"
Toronto to Punta Cana. Terrible customer service. One agent in particular was substandard by all means. The flight was delayed, but there were no gate change announcements; other airline agents were much more helpful, when the passengers were asking for updates they were frustrated with the amount of questions coming their way. The agent has no idea what he was doing and kept saying he has no idea what he’s doing, or what’s going on, turned his back at one point and made rude comments about the passengers. Overall a horrible experience. The customer service over the phone was great however.

### "issues verifying my information"
Calgary to Cancun via Mexico City. I flew Sunwing Airlines in December 2017. I was flying to Cancun when the airline actually cancelled my flight for me (I was flying with 6 other people) and they wouldn't let me on the plane because of some issues they were having verifying my information. So I had to buy a 1 way ticket to Mexico City then layover there waiting for my next flight to Cancun. They wouldn't return my initial flight or reimburse me at all (I paid 1600 for myself, and 800 for the extra direct flight) I even had to pay for a second shuttle (120). So basically 920 Canadian dollars later I was able to make it so that I could make my reservations with my family. Sunwing have the worst customer service I have ever witnessed in my life.

### "our experience was pleasant"
Toronto to Varadero, Cuba. This was our first experience flying with ‘Sunwing’ and we had a pleasant flight both ways. The check in staff were exceptionally helpful, quick and efficient. In cabin service with hot snacks and drinks was good. The seats were comfortable. Overall, our experience was pleasant, even though initially we were skeptical to take the airline after hearing adverse stories. In comparison to Air Canada, pricing was cheaper and the service was good. Keep it up Sunwing Airlines!

### "They are very deceiving"
Calgary to Punta Cana. Bad in everything. Their agent in the hotel quoted us one price and charged us a higher one and when we confronted him, he said sorry and no refund. The biggest issue is that we booked a direct flight to find out that in our way back it had a stop that added 6 hours to the flight and they said read the fine print as we are allowed to make any change. They are very deceiving. Stay away and never again. The flights has no meals and there is basic food for purchase only and no compensation for the extra hours.

### "customer service is almost non-existent"
Flew Sunwing Airlines from Toronto to Santa Clara. The worst airline and I have flown more than 100 times and I must say I never been that dissapointed with an airline. The customer service is almost non-existent. People at the desk were rude. It look like they dont enjoy their job, it took everything to get help! This was my first time with Sunwing and probably my last.

### "just want my phone back"
Edmonton to Punta Cana. I accidentally forgot my phone on the plane. Fortunately the sunwing rep at the resort was able to assure me that it was found and was waiting in Edmonton for me. He had given me 2 numbers to call to arrange picking it up. The first red flag was the fact he gave a Toronto area code numbers. When I did get back home I called the numbers. I also went to the airport to talk directly with lost and found. Toronto at that point never returned my calls, Edmonton however did a few days later. They said that sunwing did have my phone and it was in Toronto. They also said it was in the "on hand room" and to call the number provided and to let them know that is where it is. A couple of days later Toronto has called me back, when I told her it was in the on hand room she said it wouldn't be there. I asked her to look because sunwing says it was there. She replied why would I do that? I asked to please look and she said she straight up wouldn't that if she didn't have it, it wouldn't be in there. Mind you I'm skipping over the 9 other numbers I've been told to call with no responses from any of them. At this point I want to rip my hair out with frustration. So I called Edmonton back for more details and to see if there is anyway they could get someone to check the on hand room. But to no surprise I have not been called back. I returned on feb26 and it's now march7 over one week later and I'm still without my phone that has apparently been found. At this point I just want my phone back, I'm willing to pay the courier fee to ship from T.O to Edm even though it was to be in Edmonton upon my arrival.

### "Sunwing couldn't have cared less"
Flying home from week stay in Cuba booked through Sunwings vacations. Was supposed to leave on flight WG 619 on Feb 4 at 3.05am. Boarded plane late and mechanical issue with plane so all passengers deplaned and waited. Reboarded after a couple of hours but still issues with plane. Captain informed us that it would be quite a long wait as the mechanical issue was a bigger problem than originally though. Waited in airport and not one person informed us of what we should do. Finally after a few more hours, over the intercom, passengers of that flight were told to go to gate 3. We did and were ushered through the gate only to find ourselves back at immigration and ushered through there back into the baggage area and main lobby. All our baggage was laying on the floor. Again not one Sunwing rep in sight to inform us of what was happening or where we were to go. As one big herd of people, we found ourselves pushed outside and then yelled at to go forward and right. Buses waiting with finally one rep there but so busy yelling at people to get on the buses. Word through the passengers was that we were being taken to another resort to wait. Bused for 30 minutes to resort where they took our passports and said they would give them back later as they were trying to deal with 169 passengers. Now we have no Visas nor passports. Waited until 9 pm to be picked up again and taken to airport. Rechecked luggage, stood in line for Visas again then stood in line for immigration, then back through security only to find that no one even knew if a plane was available. The entire time, not one Sunwing rep was there to speak with the passengers or let us know what was happening. Sat in airport for more hours, even the long suffering flight crew of our flight weren't sure what was going on. Internet was spotty at best and whenever someone was able to access it, they would get information for passengers from friends and families checking flight status or website. That's how we were able to try to stay informed. Not one time did a rep come around even with just bottled water for us and to tell us what was happening. Finally, finally we were able to board the same aircraft as before and made it home 29 hours later. And guess what, we were handed a photocopied sheet of paper informing us that we can get a $150 credit. Big deal. All they had to do was just inform the passengers what was happening. Everyone knew that mechanical failures happen and every passenger wanted to be safe. But it was a case of Sunwing couldn't have cared less.

### "No apologies or explanation"
I've flown Sunwing several times and it gets worse and worse each time. Going to Ft. Lauderdale we were delayed 6 hours. No refund or credit given. Now we are delayed going home over an hour wait so far. No apologies or explanation. Definitely will reconsider flying Sunwing again.

### "as short a flight as possible"
I was very specific about a direct flight both ways and paid for the exactly that. I wanted as short a flight as possible because I was recently in a car accident and my back hurts if I sit for a long time. Imagine my suprise when I found out there was an added stop in Toronto to refuel adding 4 hours of flight time. Was told it’s not a big deal, might not of been to them but after sitting in that little seat for 10 hours I was ready to die. The pain was ridiculous and the response was even worse.

### "old aircraft and old seats"
Toronto to Vancouver. Horrible experience flying Sunwing. Beware the price is not worth the hurdles this airline puts you through. Sunwing will try to ding you for any extras they can land their hands on. Rude staff on ground, will measure your carry on to the tenth of a kilogram and try to charge you for check in. In flight comfort is terrible, old aircraft and old seats. I do not recommend flying Sunwing at all. I would rather support an airline that’s more expensive but takes measures to accommodate the comfort and satisfaction of the traveller.

### "very disappointed"
Toronto to Punta Cana. I have been very disappointed with flying Sunwing the last few times. They used to offer meals, snack and drinks. Now they only come around for drinks and do not even provide any snacks whatsoever. There are no USB/outlets on the plane, so if you are not interested in the one movie playing, I hope you use your phone battery wisely. On our flight the bathroom broke, causing a bit of a smell throughout the plane for the rest of our flight. If I didn't like going to RIU resorts, I would not choose to fly Sunwing again.

### "not sure I would fly Sunwing again"
Montreal to Montego Bay. I am writing you today to let you know how bad of a treatment we had today with Sunwing. First of all, we were supposed to leave to Montego Bay at 15:40, the flight got delay till 16:10. Than, got delay again, telling us we would leave at maximum 17:00, but than at 16:55 they made an announcement telling us we were changing gate; from 5 to 53, which is at the other end of the airport, ridiculous for family with young kids. Finally, at 17:30 they made an boarding announcement, but we quickly realize we were boarding a bus instead of the plane. That bus was bringing us back to gate 5, than we get into the plane, no TV or USB connection, like they advise for. During all that time, they never told us the reason for the delay, not a good start to our vacation. I am not sure I would fly with Sunwing again, or recommend it.

### "rude lady at boarding"
Vancouver to Toronto. I am okay with the airline being less than extravagant because it was a cheap flight. What I am not ok with is the extremely rude lady at boarding. The lady at the check in forgot to charge us, I have only taken Westjest and Air Canada (which gives 1 free bag) so thought it was normal so after she rudely told my partner and I this, not even apologizing for the inconvenience. His CC was declined so I asked what would happen if he couldn't pay. Again very rudely said "so you don't carry cash or another credit card at the airport? very rude the entire time. Her attitude was disgusting. Maybe Sunwing should invest in some decent staff if they can't provide a comfortable flight.

### "had a terrible attitude"
Calgary to Cancún. The check in counter staff had a terrible attitude. We did not book our seats online and her first response was to ask you guys did not book your seats on line? You will need to be sitting in different seats separate from each other, before even checking the seats plan. She was coughing while working through our passports, she kept coughing and I asked if she’s ok? She said she had just been outside (-15c). I understand it but shouldn’t her not even be working her shift when she was sick? It was bad for her and bad for customers on receiving  bad service.

### "best way to lose customers"
Montreal to Aruba. We cancelled our previous flight and booked Sunwing only because it was a direct flight to our destination and also leaving three nights earlier because it is a direct flight. Three days before our departure we were notified that we will be stopping somewhere else (Punta Cana) to pick up other passengers. We will be waiting for 2 hours on a plane while this happens! It is in the terms and conditions so we have no say. Even if we cancel we cannot bank this flight value we lose all our money. This is the best way to lose customers. Have flown every airline in the industry American and Canadian and this is first and last time I will ever use Sunwing. They obviously do this to save money not to send planes that are not full but in the end they will still lose customers. Shame on them. Charge people more but when you offer direct flight, make it a direct flight not force us to stop in another country.

### "trip is now short 1 day"
We arrived to the airport 3 hours before the flight and at check in they let us know that our flight is been delayed until 6:15. They gave us some food vouchers and after they delayed the flight again until 8:40. We had been at the airport for more than 7 hours. We call Sunwing but can't reach them by phone. We ask the staff at the airport and no one could give a good reason why we are delayed. This is the last time we book with Sunwing - if they could call us or just send an email it would be fine with us but now our trip is now short 1 day.

### "stranded at Varadero airport"
Varadero to Toronto. We were stranded at Varadero airport due to the aircraft been delayed for more than an hour from its previous destination, and consequently due to a serious mechanical problem which took more than 3 hours to fix. If you've never been stuck in Varadero at night, here is what you will most likely experience: - no personnel to talk to other than the security check people, who enjoy the downtime playing domino and are very reluctant to reach for any help - only couple places are open, and they only sell junk food; save some cash so you can at least buy water - disgustingly dirty and clogged washrooms; no staff to take care It took some efforts to bring police officers, the chief of the airport, and eventually the Sunwing representative (in ~2 hours). This person was only there to let the steam escape. He had no power to arrange for water or food, nor could he offer any alternative plan of action other than to wait and see. A flight attendant brought 20-30 plastic cups and one bottle of warm water, while the airport personnel were walking around with icy water, two cups each, joking about it. I have been flying for many years with numerous companies around the world. Problems do happen, and when they do the companies take care of their passengers: they offer food and water, or alternatively provide vouchers that can be used at the airport - they provide temporary accommodation; given the location of Varadero airport, busing so many people back and forth and finding a place to accommodate them is not really a viable option - they arrange for alternative flights or aircraft; should the Sunwing representative had been present they could have arranged earlier an airplane to come from Toronto or other Sunwing destinations (provided the company had such policy to support its customers) - they even reimburse their customers for caused inconvenience Considering the circumstances at Varadero airport maybe it is time for Sunwing to look into these options instead of bragging about their "champagne service" (a sip of sparkling wine).

### "It is not worth the savings"
Terrible service. Flight was to depart from Vancouver at 11.15pm and was delayed until 4am. They refused to offer accommodations or a flight change. Only offered a $10 voucher for food on a flight that is overnight. After all of the inconvenience they still gave my daughter a hard time for having 1.5lbs over for her carry on baggage and told us we needed to be charged to check it. Do not book with this airline to save a few hundred dollars! It is not worth the savings!

### "just seem to care about your money"
Flew Vancouver to Toronto with Sunwing. All fine print/policy needs to be reviewed with this airline, there are fees for everything. They will sell you tickets with lower prices than the competition then charge you for your carry-on. This makes the cost a little more expensive than other airlines. Plane was 1.5 hour delayed. Staff are friendly, some are smarmy. They just seem to care about your money. No free onboard entertainment. Food is costly and below average. Their staff and policy needs some human touch. I felt cheated and ripped off.

### "In a phrase, flyer beware"
Toronto to Orlando. Less expensive doesn't mean better. When booking a flight to Orlando, Florida from Toronto Canada for my sister and I, we researched several different travel options. Ultimately, we selected Sunwing Airlines based on its convenient flight times as well as being the most cost-effective. Unfortunately, the flight times were the only convenience that we would experience from a flight perspective. On departure day, we followed the online procedures for printing our boarding passes but were unable to which resulted in us having to stand in line at the airport. So much for convenience! Once we arrived at the gate, we discovered that the flight crew were running late but that was only the start of what would amount to a lengthy delay in the neighborhood of an hour and a half. Apparently, a family was held up in customs so the airline was grounded until he and his family arrived. After their arrival, we took off and finally arrived at our destination over 45 minutes late. On our return flight, we were once again unable to print out our boarding passes online and were forced to wait an hour for Sunwing customer support, while representatives stood around aimlessly conversing amongst themselves. Additionally, we had to weigh our carry-on baggage and were assessed an overage fee. During departure, our bags were not weighed and we didn't have to pay. Based on these unforeseen charges we elected to check our carry-on luggage for an additional $62 dollars. These were fees we did not anticipate. The hour that we lost at the check-in to simply collect our boarding passes that weren't available online caused us to stand in an extremely long security line. Luckily, we left our hotel over three hours from our scheduled departure time. In the end, based on the additional charges that Sunwing applied the flight ended up costing us more than flying with a more well-known airline like Air Canada. Not to mention that the charges were in US dollars so with the exchange rate it was much more than we ever wanted to spend. In a phrase, flyer beware!

### "never flying Sunwing again"
Vancouver to Puerto Vallarta. So I've flown all inclusive with Sunwing before and haven't been very impressed, but this time they have really "outdone" themselves and not in a good way. We were booked for an all inclusive trip to Mexico scheduled to leave Vancouver May 5th at 5pm and arrive in Puerto Vallarta at 11pm. They just informed us today that our flights have been changed so that we will be now leaving at 9pm getting to the hotel around 3am. We don't get out hotel room until May 6th, at 3pm the next day. So what exactly are we supposed to do at the hotel in the early morning with no room to check into? I have been on many all inclusive trips and I understands that flights do change, but I have never before arrived at hotel 12 hours before being able to check in, in the middle of the night. We called Sunwing to complain and their response was that they changed the flight for "business reasons" and there is nothing they can do for us, we can cancel and reschedule the vacation (not an option, we are meeting friends there and have had planned this trip for months). We asked about getting a room when we get there and they said sure if you want to pay the hotel and extra $150 to book the room for that night. After this experience and the lack of willingness to accommodate for the inconvenience, we will definitely never be flying with Sunwing again.

### "service is downright awful"
Toronto to Varadero. When in line to check in you should not question 14 of us that this is the Elite line, we paid for this service, which I might add gives you nothing. When checking in your staff could try and be a little bit more pleasant, smile, talk! When on the flight your staff could be a little bit more happier, and perhaps let the people whom really need to use the washroom use it. Please tell me what, if anything, is going on behind that little curtain that will not allow people to use the washroom? Your service is downright awful.

### "great ending to a wonderful holiday"
We flew March 18th from Edmonton to Cancun. We were delayed from leaving because of the heavy traffic in Cancun, which our captain explained to us. We left a little later but no big deal. The crew was awesome and so was the flight. We left to come home on the 25th and once again, it was a great flight. The crew was courteous, even humorous at times and gave us any info we may have needed to ensure a safe and prompt flight. Thank you to the captain, and crew for a great flight. All flights should have the staff that we did. It was a great ending to a wonderful holiday.

### "flight had been changed again"
We arrived to the check-in gate on-time at 1:40pm. They hadn't even bothered to put up the flight info on the screen until 2:00pm. I was asked by numerous other customers if it was the correct gate to be standing in. We all waited in line for over an hour and half without any notification as too what the delay was. The Sunwing reps were all standing around laughing and having a good time while all the passengers waited in line sweating and hot. I know it was Punta Cana and very hot but If we had known there was going to be such a delay, we would have got out of the line and sat down where it was more comfortable. Finally after such a long wait we found out that the plane was on the tarmac and luggage loaded but they had no pilot. They suggested that we take a seat and wait around for another hour while they figure out what the issue was. We were finally told the flight was going to be moved to 2:30 and would arrive back in Toronto for 7am. They sent us to a hotel for few hours. We finally arrived at the hotel 5:30pm to find out that the flight had been changed again and we wouldn't be arriving into Toronto till 9am now. So we get back to the airport and on the flight information screens it says our plane is going to Saint John's instead of Toronto. The one bonus of a flight that early is that we were the only plane leaving and was a very quiet airport. The downfall is that Sunwing can't even get the plane out on time when its the only plane on the departures. While on flight, they offered us a complementary ham and cheese sandwich. I know why it was complimentary, as it tasted like the sandwiches that were supposed to be on our original flight. We ended up finally getting into Toronto at 9:40 am.

### "attendants surpassed expectations"
Montego Bay to Sault Ste. Marie. Very happy with Sunwing. Read reviews and was afraid but now after flying with Sunwing I love the staff. Flight attendants surpassed expectations. Polite and happy. Sunwing will have my business anytime. Can't wait for our next family trip. =

### "ship us all via buses "
Windsor to Cancun. So we arrived in Windsor this morning to catch our flight to Cancun. All of Sunwing Airlines sites said the plane was on time. The plane circled the airport for 45 minutes due to poor weather and then flew on to Toronto. Instead of waiting for the weather to clear, some genius decided to ship us all via buses from Windsor to Toronto to meet up with the plane. So after sitting all day in the airport we are now on a bus headed to Toronto. For good measure they throw in a couple boxes or "snacks​" for the trip. Before boarding the bus, they announced all flighta into Toronto had been cancelled. Also the news has reported the eastbound lanes of the 301 are shut down. I'm not really excited to be driving in a bus in poor weather to catch a plan that is most likely going to be cancelled. To top this all off, when contacting Sunwing Airlines, because there is no representation at the Windsor airport, the rep said there will be no reimbursement because flight times always change. I'm sorry but this isn't just a flight time change. We are driving to a whole other airport for godsakes! The last thing that totally infuriates me is that there are several people with walkers and wheel chairs. How the hell did you expect to get them on the bus? Trust me, this was not thought about. If I was anyone of those poor people I'd be even made upset. I'd love to see Sunwing step up and rectify this situation, but I'm not holding my breath!

### "the flights were torture"
Calgary to Punta Cana return. Overcrowded small aircraft not made for longer distances, dirty plastic seats that have no space for legs. I'm 5'10 and had 1 inch free standing straight. Never mind reclining. Return, they mentioned a technical stop. For some economic reason they would not disclose they made a flight that should have lasted 6.5 hours into 10 hours by stopping in Toronto. Same bad conditions. No free service. No free meals, no assistance. The worst flight of my life, and I go a lot. So although the Sunwing vacation (resort) was great - the flights were torture, and I would be hesitant to book again. Would probably spend at least another 200$ or more for a different airline. Note: many tried to book "elite" for same reason. the elite has 6 seats at the emergency exit that have more space but are super uncomfortable. Again, too small a plane for those distances. Severely need upgrade to a larger jet or more comfy arrangements, including free meals if flight is over 6 hours.

### "quality of service is going down"
San Jose del Cabo to Edmonton. The plane was very delayed and we were supposed to land in Edmonton at 4:45 but we ended up there after 9:00 pm. When we were starting to take off the plane did not have any air conditioning and it was 30+ Celsius outside. I flew with Sunwing Airlines before and the quality of service is going down. We were told to leave the resort at 8:15 in the morning, so we didn't have anything to eat from 8:15 to 11pm at night. Sunwing didn't provide a single snack and they didn't have tea or coffee. We were told that the espresso machine is broken. The flight was advertised as champagne but we didn't receive anything. We were offered a juice or water twice. The crew didn't not inform us about specific landing times nor did they say how close we are to Edmonton. Not even once.

### "treatment was less than human"
Varadero to Toronto. I have witnessed more than a few comical, inept and annoying check-in processes in my life, but ours with Sunwing on January 27, for the 5pm Toronto to Varadero Flight 622 is the winner. We were at the check-in at 1pm with pre-paid entry to the Premium Plaza Lounge to which we were so looking forward at the start of our holiday. We received quickly our boarding passes from a machine, but no baggage tag. For that, we were compelled to stay in a very very long line for almost two hours. The unfortunate young agent trying to direct people to check-in points (more than half of which were unstaffed) was asking people on later flights (like ours) to stand aside, infuriating those of us who had paid for lounge access. The whole situation was a mess. In the end, we had less than an hour in the lounge. The two young ladies in front of us had even less time for an $80 experience. The end of our stay in Cuba ended with another dismal effort from Sunwing. Flight 623 on February 3 was delayed from its scheduled 9.30pm departure to what eventually became 1.30am the next day. You want to talk about a long final day at a resort waiting for your flight home, this worsened by having then to take an airport bus three hours before flight time leaving us with nothing to do in a small airport, passengers stretched out on chairs trying to sleep, almost beside themselves with tiredness waiting for the incoming flight? Do the airlines realize how silly the euphemism "equipment failure" has become? To airline passengers it simply means "They aren't going to tell us. Quite frankly, given the very large plane, every seat taken, that took us home, it was abundantly clear that Sunwing was simply waiting until they could fly a full plane. Our treatment was less than human. The crew apologized for the inconvenience associated with a 5am arrival in Toronto, but didn't offer a sandwich or a glass of wine to convince us of their sincerity.

### "not really Elite service"
We have travelled with Sunwing before with the Elite package from Toronto to Jamaica and were very pleased with what this class had to offer. We were checked in with no line-up, our bags were processed quickly and we virtually had no wait time. However, more recently, we travelled with Sunwing to Dominican Republic from Halifax to Punta Cana, again with Elite status, however the special service was not as positive as the Toronto experience. We were able to check in through a separate line which was quick however we had to wait in line with all other passengers, for an extended period of time to check in our baggage. Extra seat space is still minimal. Regular seat leg room with this airline is very cramped! On the return from Punta Cana, we were processed in a separate line and our baggage was taken, however when it came time to board the plane we were in a very long lineup, with everyone else, with really no order to the boarding process at all. This was not really Elite service by any stretch of the imagination.

### "a very awful experience"
Calgary to Cayo Coco via Edmonton. I e-mailed, faxed and left messages everyday for 1 week. Not one word back, no validation for my horrible experience - nothing. Very poor company to deal with. What a waste of my money and time. My one and only bag between both me and my 15-year-daughter was forgotten in Calgary. We were horrified at the Cuba airport when the luggage carousel stopped and closed down with no bag. We had only what we were wearing and needless to say just coming from -30 degree weather we were quite appropriately dressed for -30 degree weather…not +30!! We both felt very lost, angry and sad. This was our first time to Cuba which we took a year to decide where to go and plan and I just wanted to get back on the plane and go home. I filled out the missing luggage form at the airport and they said to talk to a Sunwing rep at the hotel. Upon arrival at the hotel the Sunwing rep had gone home for the day. I told hotel staff that I had no luggage and have no necessities and they told me they will send toothpaste and toothbrush which never did arrive in my room that night. Next day I talked with a Sunwing rep and they said they could give me $50 a day per bag missing. I told them there are 2 people for 1 bag as we shared the bag that is missing; we both have nothing. Sunwing rep said no, they can give $50 per bag only, plus we had to wait 24 hours before getting the money. Very stressful and frustrating to find that out as I spent a lot of money to come on vacation with no luggage and now we have to sit in our room because we don’t have sunscreen or a bathing suit, just our winter grub on. People were looking at us like we were from another planet, it was very depressing. My daughter and I both cried in the room together, it was devastating. When we finally got our $50 between the both of us, we started hunting for a bathing suit and shoes. The resort did not offer much whatsoever but we spent our $50 on two rubber flip flops and 1 bathing suit each. That’s it, our $50 was done for the day. Next day, $50 got us sunscreen and some toiletries. There were no clothes to be had anywhere so we made the most out of a winter scarf and a winter shawl with our thick tights each evening in order to be allowed to get into the buffet/restaurants to eat. There was not a brush to be bought on the resort or at two markets within the area so a staff member felt bad for us and brought us a brush from her home. Our luggage did finally arrive on day 6 into our stay. Why Sunwings bothered at that point is beyond me. Just a very awful experience.

### "a 5h flight ended up being nearly 11h"
Vancouver to Cabo via Victoria with Sunwing. Poor service. Flight was scheduled to leave Vancouver at 9:05am and passengers sat on plane for 4+ hours receiving multiple excuses from Sunwing as to why we hadn't departed: "We are waiting for 4 passengers / We are waiting for a cabin member / We are having mechanical issues / We need to de-ice the plane. The excuses kept changing and throughout the 4+ hour wait, Sunwing did not offer any beverage service or even water. Upon departure, at 12:50pm, we had to stop in Victoria to pick up additional passengers, in which the pilot made a special apology to the Victoria passengers "sorry for the wait", but with no thank you / apology to those from Vancouver who had sat there patiently for hours, parched and hungry. What was supposed to be a simple 5 hour flight ended up being an entire day, nearly 11 hours on an airplane with no regard to passenger care. Sunwing should have stepped up and at the bare minimum acknowledge the delay and provide beverages to those from Vancouver. Would definitely not use this airline again and their "champagne service" is a joke! Sunwing should focus on quality service instead of offering cheap champagne in plastic cups.

### "most uncomfortable flight ever"
Edmonton to Cabo. I thought a charter wouldn't be much different than a mainstream airline. However, really bad start when I was singled out to weigh my carry-on. I had a normal sized carry-on that weighed 8 kgs. Apparently Sunwings maximum weight for carry-on is 5kgs. All other airlines are much higher. My girlfriends carry-on was much larger in size and weighed 20.2 lbs, but they never weighed hers? There were many people with large carry-ons that never were weighed. I'm not complaining about the cost as there was none to check it but I had packed it as I needed some items in my carry on. Next, was the space between the seats. I'm 6' and 195lbs, so fairly normal and it was the most uncomfortable flight ever. I don't know how larger people survived the flight. Later someone told me that they modified the airplane to get more seats on it. You better take a ipad with a downloaded movie as they still have the drop down screens from the 1980's. Our 6 days at the resort were great, the two flying were something I would like to forget.

### "zero customer service"
Toronto to Vancouver return. Disappointing and frustration overload. Excellent aircraft but zero customer service. No 24 hour prior to flight check in, it's on their site but does not work until between 4 hours and 90 minutes from flight so everyone arrives at the airport 4 hours prior to flight to get a decent seat. Flight was late taking off but that is common - landed in Vancouver and waited in the plane for 40 mins before getting to the gate. No baggage came out for a full 2 hours and 50 mins later, there was a rep there finally,  I asked her if she was from SunWing and she said yah but that she was only a counter agent. She just stared at her phone when I asked here where the hundred some odd people's luggage was. Missed the sea bus and transit links to my car. Cost me 80 dollars in cab fare.

### "absolutely disappointing"
This flight was the most uncomfortable and disappointing flight. There were 4 hours of delay with no warning or notification. We boarded the plane 10 minutes late and the flight attendant told us that we would have to stop in Windsor for refueling. We waited at Pearson Airport for 1.5 hours on the plane for the de-icing process. Then 45 minutes later we landed in Windsor to wait another 2 hours on the plane for de-icing and fuelling and permission to take off. We were so patient at this point only to find out that there was not enough food on the plane for purchase! 8 hours stuck on the plane with no food and not even enough snacks. They didn't even think that with this many people on board they have to provide more food. Then the captain said that all this was Sunwing's fault due to shift changes prior to our departure. The airline did not offer anything to passengers, we had to actually pay for a small box of chips. This would definitely be my last trip with Sunwing, there were no apologies or no incentive provided to the passengers cosidering the fact that we were stuck for so many hours on the plane and lost more than 4 hours of our vacation just because of shift changes at the airline. Absolutely disappointing.

### "very disappointed"
Calgary to Varadero with Sunwing Airlines. We boarded on time, but the plane did not move. It looked like they over booked the flight, and we had to wait over an hour to take off for them to collect the proper paperwork. That was not my biggest complaint. We flew Sunwing in April as well from Calgary to Varadero and it was a completely different experience. In April you could pay cash for food and drinks, they gave full cans of soft drinks and a free hot meal on the way back. This time you got one small gulp of champagne on the way there, very slow getting a beer or cocktail. The flight attendant looked annoyed when we asked for a drink. They do not take cash or debit cards which in my opinion is not fair one bit - not everyone has a credit card. I had to pay for my friends drinks and collect money from them later which was stupid and I still haven't received all my money back, because after a few drinks it is hard to figure out who owes what. On the way back it was worse - no snacks, not even some cookies or crackers or anything. If you wanted something to eat it had to be paid by credit card only. I was not doing this again for my friends so they got nothing. When my husband asked for a coke, he got half of a small cup. I just do not think it is fair that you have to have a credit card to purchase food. Very disappointed. The crew on the way there was very rude as well. I will probably book on Westjet or Transat going forward unless Sunwing gets it together .

### "the crew was great"
Toronto to Saint Martin with Sunwing Airlines. The plane was on time and clean, the crew was great. The food was not great but I've had worse. I would certainly fly with Sunwing again. I wasn’t sure what they would be like but they’re certainly competitive. Air Canada, (especially Rouge) and Westjet should pay attention to how this airline conducts business.

### "crew were professional"
Montreal to Cancun with Sunwing. Flight from Montreal to Cancun departed on time, the crew were professional but didn't smile much. Food was good too, I was surprised that for a 4h flight we had 2 services of food. We arrived early. Check in was very quick, but we arrived 3h in advance. I would recommand this company overall.

### "had no problems with the airline"
Flew from Pearson Toronto to Punta Cana. I have flown with Sunwing Airlines and I have had no problems with the airline. When we got to the gate at Toronto, boarding was fairly quick, and staff were efficient. I was lucky to get on their new 737's. The airplane smelled new and fresh, the cabin temperature was cool and comfortable. Staff were friendly too. We took off right on time, and it was early in the morning so the crew turned on the cool blue lights to match up with the sky. We got served breakfast a few hours later, French toast with jam and tea or coffee, it was pretty good. Some people who weren't in elite plus started to walk around to stretch their legs, the extra 50$ is worth it. We landed smoothly. It was a great trip, would recommend.

### "not apologetic in the slightest"
We were supposed to leave for Freeport at 8am, expecting to land at 11.00 in the Bahamas. Our Sunwing Airlines flight got delayed until 4.00. Both tyres of the plane needed to be replaced, but they didn't have extra parts there. They had to order more, wait for the order to get to the airport, fix the part, test it out, and then allow us to board. They gave us meal vouchers. A $20 meal voucher to replace a full day of vacation. They are not apologetic in the slightest. They didn't seem willing to give us any refund or compensation at all. Great way to spend the first day of my honeymoon.

### "it was not worth it"
Sunwing Airlines only allow 1 carry-on and carry-on must be 5kg or less. Extra carry on must go to luggage check in. They charge $26 per piece of luggage. No drinks or food for the 4 hour flight. Every item is charged for. No AC outlet to charge smart devices on the plane. No movies to watch on the flight. Flight from Vancouver to Toronto was delayed on departure. Upon arrival, there was a problem with the airbridge. Lots of mechanical issues. Flight was cheap, you get what you paid for, but based on the experience, it was not worth it.

### "tortuously slow"
I was warned not to fly with Sunwing Airlines but the price was right for a last minute ticket from Vancouver to Toronto. Flight was delayed 1.5 hour (apparently this is quite common), the check in process was tortuously slow even though I did a web check in and just needed a boarding pass (getting a boarding pass through my phone did not seem to be an option) and I find out as I'm getting my boarding pass that carry on luggage must weigh <5kg otherwise it has to be checked for a fee of $26. Total cash grab and hugely inconvenient for people wanting to avoid checked luggage. I've flown with countless airlines all over the world but I won't fly with them again.

### "everything went smoothly"
I was extremely apprehensive after reading the plethora of negative reviews about flying Sunwing. But much to my surprise, everything went smoothly on this trip both coming and going to Jamaica. Both flights were on time, no delays. The flight staff was friendly, and I had no issues with the food they served. Going to Jamaica, they did serve Champaigne, and gave everybody hot towelettes. Yes the glass of Champaigne was small, but please people just get over it. We upgraded to Elite Plus. $50 was so worth the extra leg room forget about the other little perks of board first and getting your luggage first, the leg room to me was the most important. The only issue we had was boarding in Jamaica, and they did not board the Elite Plus passengers first. We quickly told them they were wrong in doing this, and they then let all of us board. The reason for these types of issues, is that when not in Canada, they staff at other airports are more often than not, just workers at the airport, and they do not work for Sunwing. So they are probably not all that familiar with boarding procedures for certain airlines like Sumwing. I would fly with them again

### "it was hot and smelly"
Flew Vancouver to Cabo via Victoria. Terrible crew with attitudes. Seats with no leg room, couldn't pull out tray because of the small space. Aircraft had no air. Coming back it was hot and smelly. I was to first to use the washroom, it had not been cleaned from the previous flight. There was no toilet paper or paper to dry your hands. I went in after the flight attendant and she made no attempt to refill the papers. On our way back we were early and stuck in Victoria for more than an hour. We arrived after midnight in Vancouver, stuck again for more than an hour as there was no one to bring the stairs to the aircraft. The heat in the plane was unbearable and they only served one small drink. Will not fly with Sunwing again.

### "poor planning and scheduling"
Firstly, Sunwing does not state any hidden costs involved when you arrive or depart the airport. When we arrived to Punta Cana, we had to pay $10 USD as their arrival tax. When you leave, you must pay a $20 USD departure tax before you can check in. We read online about this tax and usually other airlines would incorporate it into their flight or bigger airlines might just waive this for customers. If this tax is not paid, you cannot enter the airport or get checked into your plane. Secondly, there were long line up's to check in - it took us 90 minutes standing in line. There is no online kiosk available and even if you check in online, you still need to line up to drop off your baggage. Sunwing partners with DR's tourism company Nexus - which they arranged for shuttle buses to drop you off and pick you up - which is a plus. However, there is poor planning and scheduling. They drop off all the passengers on a plane at the same time - hence causing the 90 minute wait. (We were the only airline that had a long line up for the 90 minutes we were at the airport and we were there 2pm not the middle of the night). Not to mention - there were only two clerks serving customers checking in. Lastly, there was a long delay coming back home - what would have been a 7 hour flight became 11 hours. We needed to make a fuel stop from Punta Cana to Hamiliton, Ontario because they stated that they need to change crew and also get fuel and refresh their supplies. This is a huge inconvenience to the customer as we are left like prisoners stuck on the plane waiting for them to change crews. It is definitely not necessary to have a fuel stop as we flew from Vancouver to Punta Cana direct flight. So the only reason they did a fuel stop was because the flight attendants timed out and they needed to change crew. This caused a different and much longer flight route and delayed us. This was very poor planning and scheduling on Sunwing's part. This was the worst flying experience I've ever had. Do not choose SunWing.

### "extremely hot plane"
Flight from Montreal to Punta Cana was excellent. On April 13 our return flight was a nightmare to say the least. Arrived at Punta Cana airport on time. After waiting in line over 1.5 hours finally made it to the Exit Tax counter only to wait again for luggage/boarding counter. Boarding delayed 1 hour, no explanation. Boarded extremely hot plane, no air conditioning. We were told attempts were made to repair it but no time frame given. We were literally left to cook in the plane for almost 2 hours with door closed most of the time, the outdide temperature was 32c. We were finally left off the plane after a passenger became quite vocal about the seriousness of the situation. No one took responsibility for this carelous incident. The cabin crew except the pilot who hid in his cabin were great though, they passed around water and ice cubes to cool off. Flight was rescheduled for next morning, same airplane what a joke. Never flying Sunwing again.

### "no problems at all"
We flew Sunwing Airlines 3/21/16 to Puerto Vallarta, Mexico from Rockford IL and back on 3/28/16. No problems at all with this airline. I was worried after reading some reviews but both our flights were on time if not early both ways during the spring break peak. You are provided a free snack of pretzels and soda or may purchase other items as you wish. I always seem to get the kid kicking my seat from behind but that is just poor parenting and nothing to do with the airline. My only suggestion is to bring your own head phones. They offer (current) free movies but you will have to pay $3.00 for headphones unless you have your own. (Also, make sure you check the boards as our gate did get changed.) Overall, I am able to give a solid recommendation for this airline as a first time customer.

### "never have had a problem"
Went from Toronto to Montego Bay with Sunwing Airlines in April 2016 and have to say the flight to Jamaica and return was fantastic! Have flown a few times with Sunwing and never have had a problem. To be fair though, I have flown with Westjet and Air Canada and have had no problems either. I always look for a good price when I book a vacation. If no real price difference with the airlines I will book with Sunwing for the free meal. I think it is great they supply a little food , makes the time go faster. I do wish we could book our seats for free (or even a lower seat fee) within the 24 hours other airlines do but have had no problems so far in getting our seats together.

### "no water in washrooms"
Sunwing Airlines from Punta Cana to Calgary via Hamilton. Timing was okay both ways but no water in the washrooms. There was no pre-warning about this. When I used the washroom there were mini sanitizer packets in the sink and I thought perhaps someone had left them. I tried to use the tap but no water came out - I went out and asked one of the flight attendants and she told me that there is no water because they could not load it in Punta Cana. Staff in general were rude and offering minimal assistance - walk through aircraft at a fastpace with minimal eye contact. This flight must have been completely out of water as they don't bring you water to drink. Our first flight was 4 hours from Punta Cana to Hamilton and the second flight was 4 hours from Hamilton to Calgary. In more than 8 hours of flight they only offered water once. I am not a fussy person but I would not recommend flying with Sunwing. No entertainment, the seats were tight and no water. Eat well before take off because a tiny sandwich or a slice of pizza might not be enough to keep you full for 6-8 hours of flying

### "changed departure time several times"
This carrier changed our departure time several times. We booked in good faith for a 6:30pm departure which would allow us plenty of time to check in before our flight after work. A month later we received a flight change notice that our flight would be leaving at 12:30pm that same day. Panic as we would be required to take time off work to check in. In my husband's case that cost him a loss of a days wage and for me, I was lucky and would have to make up the time when I returned from vacation. Then another flight notice was emailed that departure would be 11:20am. The departure time and via Toronto notice came and then it was changed back to 11:20am. Very confusing as I received a phone call from Sell off Vacations that our flight was changed again to 12:30 departure. We checked our departure online just to make sure when our departure time and sure enough it was 11:20am. Never booking a vacation with Sunwing again. I don't know how they stay in business.

### "very disappointed with Sunwing"
Very disappointed with Sunwing Airlines from Toronto to Cancun return. Sat on the runway for over 3 hours before take off. No drink offered or even any information! It was understandable we may be delayed due to the weather and while I appreciate that delays happen as a result why board a plane that is going to be sitting for 3 hours on the runway. No communication or beverages served was my main issue. To top it all off we had another 3.25 delay coming home and no explanation. It makes you wonder why? This was a problem for those that planned the flight specifically to arrive at a reasonable hour in order to work the next day! We paid more money for this flight for that reason.

### "crazy, not even a coffee"
Montreal to Punta Cana with Sunwing Airlines. Took over 2 hours to get to the plane, then it took 1.5 hours to get offered a $3 bottle of warm water. We left our hotel at 11am for a 3pm flight. Didn't have 5 minutes at the airport to get food. Rushed to buy water and chips so we could survive until 4:30pm, when they offered us the warm bottles of water. The movie got stopped in the middle and took 30 minutes for them to get it back to about where they cut it. We were offered a sandwich and a small cup of Coke through the entire 4.5 hour flight. Crazy, not even a coffee!

### "not be flying this airline again"
We have flown many times with this carrier, not because we chose to, but because they have a lock on many of the resort's transportation logistics within Punta Cana and many other popular sun destinations. After the last time we flew with them over Christmas, this will be the last. It is true, this is a discount airline, and you can't expect much, however without getting into every detail, we boarded the plane, and were in Elite plus (this really isn't much in the way of elite by the way). Apparently there was another flight crew who was at their "8 hour working limit" and had to come back with our plane and the fresh crew who were aboard. From the time we boarded the plane, it was constantly made aware to us from the new flight crew and over the planes PA system about how tired these poor people were, I mean about half a dozen times. Then they promptly moved up to the elite plus seats, each took all three of them. They were repeatedly offered service for anything and everything right under our noses. Having to hear about how exhausted this poor off duty flight crew was over and over was too much. Then, the one duty flight crew decided to have "old home week" with the off duty crew right in front of our seats, loud loud talking and reminiscing. I'm not against that, but we paid extra to be in those seats and really just wanted to sleep a bit. I wasn't at all impressed with this and in addition to many other "famous Sunwing moments" will not be flying with this airline again. In closing I will say "you get what you pay for". I would gladly pay extra to avoid flying with this carrier.

### "the flights were great"
Halifax, NS to Santa Clara, Cuba with Sunwing Airlines. Our family vacation with Sunwing this year was amazing - the flights were great both arriving early, the food on the flights were great, the staff on the airplanes were the best we've ever had! Just wanted to say thanks.

### "virtually superlative"
This flight was part of a total package Toronto to Varadero, which included flights, bus from/to Varadero-Havana, and cruise out of Havana with MSC. As per our prior trip with Sunwing, this one was virtually superlative - wine twice, a bit of food, free checked baggage, seats selected when checked-in - both ways. No problems at all. The rest of the package had a few "issues", but for the money, and the experience, this was far and away the best available. In fact, I am just now looking into booking another short vacation.

### "staff friendly and knowledgable"
Right value for your money. Don't understand what the negativity is all about. As experienced traveler, I felt I got exactly what Sunwing Airlines promises: low cost air transportation. Staff is friendly and knowledgable. Food is as expected. Flights left on time.

### "many unhappy passengers"
My husband and I purchased a vacation package to Ixtapa, MX. At the time of the purchase it was a direct flight, the main reason we chose to fly with Sunwing. Six days later we received our e-tickets and that is when we learned that we were making a stop in Los Cabos, MX. Our travel agent contacted Sunwing to find out details of the stop. She was told it would be a 40 minute stop and that the passengers going to Ixtapa would remain on the plane. That didn't happen. After landing in Los Cabos we were required to take our carry on luggage and proceed to immigration. Then we were directed to the baggage carousel to pick up our checked luggage, then proceed to the check in area to re-check our bags. After that was completed we again went through security and re-boarded the same plane. Our 40 minute stop turned into 2 hours. After all that when we were finally back in the air Sunwing didn't offer any service to us. No water or snacks. Our 5.35 hour flight turned into 7.50 with only that one "bistro sandwich" which is gross and nothing for the airline to promote. Our return flight again made a stop in Los Cabos however we didn't get off the plane but our luggage did. There were many passengers loading in Los Cabos and some had the same seats assigned as the passengers from Ixtapa so we were delayed again while the seating was rearranged. Let me tell you there were many unhappy passengers on the way home. To put it simply, this was our first experience with Sunwing and it will be our last.

### "stress filled experience"
The outbound Sunwing flight from Toronto to Puerto Vallarta was over an hour late in departing. We were able to obtain Elite service at an extra cost of $50.00 each, only on the outbound flight. Elite offers priority boarding etc. but most importantly extra leg room. The "meal service" consisted of an overheated "something on a bun" that barely served as a hunger stop. At our time of booking we had paid an extra $20.00 per seat in order to avoid a middle seat on the return flight. Upon check in on the return flight, we were told that there was one seat with extra leg room for $50.00. When I had asked if I would receive a credit for the $20.00 cost of seat selection, I was told that it wasn't possible. In other words it cost $70.00 instead of $50.00. After settling into my Elite seat after over an hour delay for boarding, I was approached by a flight attendant to present my boarding card stub. Sunwing had booked the same seat twice and was directed to vacate my Elite seat. This was a needless and stress filled experience that concluded a well deserved vacation, I understand that this spring the US government will legislate the minimum leg room required in a commercial aircraft. It is a shame that Sunwing offers, at least in my situation almost zero space between my knees and the seat in front of me.

### "not get our seating cost back"
I paid to have seats reserved for my return flight. As with most couples, I would like to be seated with my spouse -  when we boarded we realized that we did not get the seats we paid 40$ for. I was not even seated with my husband. Upon writing a complaint to Sunwing, they advised that since he received the seat we reserved we would not get our seating cost back, even though I was put 5 rows away from him.

### "had no issues"
Flew Sunwing Airlines on Feb 12 to the 19th from Ottawa to Santa Clara, Cuba. Elite plus, good leg room. Food was fine both ways breakfast sandwich on way down, smoked meat or cheese panini way back. Crew were very good, friendly, funny and helpful. Both flights on time, had no issues.

### "no clue on customer service"
Following a previous horrible baggage handling experience in 2015, I decided to give this airline a second chance. Booked on a flight from Toronto to Punta Cana scheduled to depart Toronto at 9.15 am. The night before, I get a message saying flight departure delayed to 1.35 pm. We make our way to the airport and once all formalities are completed are told again by a message that departure now delayed to 3.40 pm. What a waste of an entire day. Please, if you are planning to fly Sunwing, stay clear of them. They have no clue on customer service or punctuality.

### "great service with Sunwing"
We had great service with Sunwing. Our fights leaving and returning were on time. We booked Elite Plus and as we arrived 3 hours before the flight there were no line ups. We had 2 E/F which were at the very front of the plane and had plenty of leg room, no one was in the aisle seat, but would have not been a great seat because people waiting to go to the washroom stand right There. The TV's come down from the overhead and were very close and you had to tilt your head up slightly. The seats are not very wide for us they were OK, not the best comfort I have ever had. When we arrived in Cuba the buses were a little confusing but finally found ours. The meal going was a hot croissant with either beef or chicken, and returning home was Montreal smoked meat or chicken. They were very good and hot. Free pop, water or wine with meal. Our first flight times were horrible leaving Calgary at 6:30 at night and arriving at 2 am and an hour ride to the hotel at 3 in the morning and return flight was even worse, leave The hotel at midnight and flight left at 3 am. Which is horrible as you must check out at noon or 2 pm if you have Diamond club. You do have a full day to enjoy the sun, beach and pool areas, but what if you want to relax, take a shower or change for supper? They have hospitality room but I believe each family was given a 1/2 to use it. Hanging around the lobby is not a lot of fun. My suggestion try to get better flights.

### "pathetic performance"
Sunwing Airlines flight was 13.5 hours late in leaving Milwaukee. I had been warned by a friend of mine from the Milwaukee area that this airline is notorious for not keeping schedules. We arrived in Punta Cana a day late losing one of the nights of our 7 day vacation. When we left the flight was 1 1/4 hours late leaving the DR. When we arrived back in Milwaukee a customs agent told us that Sunwing flights are continually late. Friends of ours returned from Cozumel and echoed the same complaints of delays in excess of 12 hours. Pathetic performance.

### "staff were very friendly"
We flew from Regina to Puerto Vallarta on Sunwing Airlines. We have no complaints about this airline. We also flew direct from Regina to Santa Clara, Cuba last year and again no complaints whatsoever. Our flights were both early. The staff were very friendly and smiling. We thought that the free lunch and drink of bubbly was a very nice gesture.

### "overall a great trip"
This Sunwing Airlines flight from Chicago Rockford to Cancun was arranged from Apple vacation and was a charter flight. Seat 16D was a great seat with extra leg room. Flight left early on flight out and return. Service at Rockford airport was above and beyond. Sunwing has a special line at Cancun airport for charter flights that was very short. Flight crew was pleasant and provided great service during flight. Overall a great trip with Sunwing.

### "plane was cramped"
We had a delay of 5-6 hrs flying from Lansing MI to Cancun, Mexico. First told due to weather by Sunwing Airlines and later told it was a mechanical issue (flat tyre). I don't appreciate being lied to and there was nothing given to us to accommodate for their mechanical failure other than a $15 credit at the airport stack bar - that's what my time is worth? The plane was cramped with little leg space. Did we get complimentary drinks or food on the plane to minimize the disruption and inconvenience on our vacation (we arrived a day late at our resort that we had paid for)? Nope. We heard similar stories from Canadians we met while in Mexico about Sunwing. On the return flight home, a Sunwing representive wanted to know if we wanted a little more leg room, "while sure I said" thinking maybe they dusted off the customer service manual in hiding. The answer back was for $20 I could get more leg room. I thought wow you just cost me a day of my vacation and you want to charge me $20 for more leg room.

### "nice meal, seating and service"
Toronto to Vancouver with Sunwing and it was what I expected from a charter airline. Nice meal, seating and service by flight attendants. It was first scheduled for a depart at 20:00, then delayed too 22:00. We left YYZ at 2:30. Other than that it was good.

### "get absolutely nothing extra"
Flew "Elite Plus" from Regina to Punta Cana which means you pay a premium to receive perks, airport preferred check in, more leg room etc. I will start by saying that this is simply a means of generating revenues and that you get absolutely nothing extra with the exception of the seat which we had chosen in advance. When we got to the airport to check in we found a slight few standing in the preferred check in area, we took our positions next in line. There was but one agent checking our line in, 5 or 6 were tending to the other travelers. Although we were 3rd in our line it took 1 hour to reach the counter. All regular passengers in economy had been checked in while the "Elite" were left to wait. When we questioned the agent we were given little satisfaction, we asked to speak with the supervisor who gave us no explanations, no understanding, her words were "what do you want me to do?". We were slightly delayed, nothing serious and the aircraft did make up the time but when we got to the airport and after standing in line for almost 2 hours we found ourselves at the Sunwing counter looking for our private transfers. When we booked our package we were sold "private transfers" so as to avoid the long bus rides and cramped quarters. We paid yet another premium for this service but as luck would have it, no one was standing holding up the sign with our names on it. We stood at the Sunwing counter for yet another 1/2 hour only to be told "there is nothing in the system" we provided the documents as proof but it made no difference. We then had to find our way to our hotel independently, taxi fare was another expense (not to mention the experience). We have spent the entire week here trying to find our way back to the airport but Sunwing continues to say "nothing in the system" this is a terrible experience and one that we will never forget. Here's hoping we make it home.

### "prompt courteous service"
Toronto to Los Cabos with Sunwing - prompt courteous service. Flights were direct and left on time. Food was good. Second time we used Sunwing vacations. This trip was far better. First one was to Panama. The hotel was lovely but not really all inclusive. Hotel Riu Santa in Los Cabos this trip was absolutely amazing.

### "flights both changed"
Worst experience - we booked direct flights from Toronto to Orlando with Sunwing and both were changed. Once to deliver other passangers and now in the airport as I write this our flight has been altered to go to Mexico first (from Orlando) to deliver a spare part for another aircraft before returning to Toronto. No compensation at all. Not happy and will never use Sunwing again.

### "crew kept misleading the passengers"
Terrible airline with multiple delays on both routes from Toronto to Cancun. Crew kept misleading the passengers about the reasons of the delay, missed a full day of a vacation due to the 7 hour delay and the airline offered no compensation whatsoever. This delay included many passengers who had paid extra to book the earlier flight that ended up arriving after ours, some people with a family of 4 lost up to $600. Many families with children were offered no compensation and we were all left waiting at the airport with nothing but a $15 voucher. Some of the crew flying as passengers were heard making rude comments about the frustrated families trying to get to their destination. Sunwing can count on the majority of this people not flying with them ever again.

### "2D a terrible seat choice"
Traveled from Jan.19/16-26/16 from Regina to Santa Maria Cuba. We booked our flight specifically because it was direct. 2 weeks prior to departure we were notified by our travel agent that the return flight was not direct, but did not indicate where we were stopping. Our flight left Regina as scheduled and was ok. Although I should mention we booked and paid for Elite Plus seats as soon as we booked our trip in August. Knowing the seats are extremely close together on Sunwing planes. We had 2D/E/F and 3D for both flights. A side comment is that seat 2D is a terrible seat choice as people congregate in aisle waiting for bathroom and stewardess are back and forth doing their duties squishing into your aisle/seat constantly. On the return, we had reserved seats with our Sunwing rep to use VIP lounge in airport for 25$ a person - a comfy lounge, but terrible food. Once onboard the plane we soon realized that our prepaid reserved seats were occupied! Stewardesses said they would find us a different seat! Well problem was plane was continuing on to Cao Coco, Cuba where 30 plus people were getting off. Anyhow this involved much shuffling and rudeness from flight attendants. Finally we left for Cao Coco and once airborne aircraft cooled off. About a 20 min flight and back to no air circulation and once again a refuelling process (strangest thing as we had just fueled 20 min prior). We were not allowed to deplane and again sat there for 30-45 mins. No air circulation and diesel fumes pouring in to plane. Keep in mind we were in row 2 right by door so had a wee bit of air flow - the back of the plane must have really been suffering! In Cao Coco we also had a crew change and ended up with a much more pleasant crew.

### "staff were terse and unapologetic"
Flyer beware. A six hour delay for no logical reason, coupled with sub par service, which you'll see is typical if not commonplace for Sunwing if you read any of the other reviews here. Our flight from Lansing, MI to Cancun, Mexico was originally set to leave at 2.45pm, which we then found out had been pushed to 3.45pm, and finally 8.30pm. By the time we finally took off it was well after 9.00. We lost nearly an entire day of our vacation, with no compensation being offered whatsoever. The reason? Apparently, our original plane got a flat tyre in Cancun. Their response was to send a different plane already in Cancun to Canada to pick up the necessary equipment to repair it, delaying the passengers waiting to depart from Cancun in the process. With the new tyre in tow, they then flew from Canada to Michigan in order to pick us up, so they could then fly to Cancun, repair the plane, and finally pick up the waiting passengers there. Once on the flight, they tried to sell us nearly everything, from a simple meal to headphones for the inflight entertainment. Being charged for alcoholic beverages on a flight is normal, but $7.00 USD for a sandwich? Absurd. The seats were small and cramped, with barely enough room for your legs let alone any carry-on bags. The staff were terse and unapologetic. In short, it was an awful way to start a vacation, and I can't fathom why they would have chosen to react to such a relatively small repair in the manner they did. My guess is that it allowed them to save a minuscule amount of money. Reading reviews, it's common for Sunwing to consistently run delays of 4 hours or more, and they don't seem to care about it. Our return flight to the states leaves tomorrow and I am absolutely dreading. I should note that I didn't choose Sunwing airlines. The flight was booked through a travel agency, which is where Sunwing says we need to take any and all complaints, despite them having no control over the situation.

### "staff were rude"
Calgary to Punta Cana with Sunwing - although the price was right for our vacation the staff were rude. It was almost as though the passengers were a hassle. I pride myself in good customer service and these staff could sure use a refresher course. It makes me sad because even though we paid a bit less than flying Air Transat etc I don't think we should have to compromise customer service on flights.

### "service consisted of constant sales pitches"
Flight delays with no explanations, terse service and horrible food. Flight to Cancun from Edmonton, Alberta was delayed by 2 hours. Not once did the staff announce details of the delays or apologize for them. We were simply left in the dark. Finally when the flight was boarding we were told there had been a family emergency causing the delay while we waited for additional crew. Why not tell us sooner? Food was horrible - a disgustingly buttery pastry filled with a tablespoon of scrambled eggs. Service consisted of constant sales pitches to buy duty free products and excursions. Regular service for beverages and food was terse and sparse. Return flight was delayed by 5 hours. Again we were told nothing about the delay until the flight was boarding. They claimed it was due to a flat tyre. Service on the return flight was polite, but the cart came only once. The food was again terrible. We were told it was not the usual caterer. Frankly, that does not excuse terrible food. Sunwing is still responsible for the quality of the caterers they hire. Both landings were awful. Overall a terrible experience.

### "does not provide value"
We booked our direct Sunwing Airlines flights to Mazatlan and no more than 8 days after booking the airline changed departure times and added a stopover in Peurto Vallarta on the way home with travel from Mazatlan taking over 8 hours to get home. Exiting flight in Mazatlan was delayed over half hour so airline could first offload passengers travelling on to Puerto Vallarta so they could be herded thru customs first in Mazatlan. Left at 8 am but with all delays did not even arrive at Hotel Riu till 3 pm! If your time is worth something do not book with this airline. Delays were appalling enough! Insult to injury was the rudeness of the main attendent who was so rude to all the passengers. The final straw was that they wanted us to depart from hotel 4 hours before departure time to come home which translated to being in transit starting at 9:30 am and arriving at Calgary customs at 8:30 PM. This airline does not provide value in any way.

### "not fly Sunwing again"
We were going to upgrade when we got to the airport for our flight to Cuba, as we were offered to upgrade to "business class", but when I asked what the difference was between the seats - he said not much - free Champaign?? As soon as I walked onto the airplane, I noticed there was no first class. The inflight movie did not turn on until 45 minutes into the flight to Cuba. We were only offered 1 drink and the smallest meal. 1 chocolate square was the dessert. The seats were so tiny, no leg room at all. and they wanted to charge additional to move to the exit seats, even though no one was sitting in them? they also would not let people move within the airplane at all. Old, outdated, would not fly Sunwing again.

### "service was fine"
I was anxious to fly Sunwing Airlines from Edmonton to Cancun after reading several bad reviews.I was pleasantly surprised! Our flight was pretty great. Yes the seats are tight, but it was managable. Service was fine and we were on time. I was happy.

### "service was excellent"
I flew with Sunwing from Montreal to Santa Clara, Cuba on January 1 and returned to Montreal January 8. This was my second time flying with Sunwing and I would not hesitate to fly with them again. The service on the plane was excellent. The flight attendants were attentive and professional. It was a direct non stop flight it left on time and our return flight home was also on time. The Santa Clara airport needs some attention. The check in to come home was horrible but not Sunwing's fault as many flight were leaving at the same time and the small airport could not handle the amount of people.

### "worst I have used"
Sunwing Airlines is the worst airline I have used. January 15th was the flight home from Cancun due to take off time at 3:40pm. We were notified at the resort our flight is delayed for four hours so we stayed the extra hours at the resort. Then we got pick up and we arrived to the airport. Checked in and go to the gate and the boarding of the flight starts. Our flight is delayed another 2 hours. Then delayed by again for 2 hours and delayed till 1:30am January 16th. We stayed in the airport from 5pm till 1:30am. My wife is pregnant 6.5 months and all that waiting in the airport was not good. I was given voucher for $75 to on next time flying with Sunwing Airlines. Do they really think I'm gonna travel with them again

### "plane delayed 4 hours"
The first flight from Milwaukee to Puerta Vallarta the plane was delayed 4 hours for a maintenance signature. Mechanic in area called in sick so mechanic from Rockford drove up. Then leaving Puerta Vallarta the flight delayed again almost three hours with no explanation. At least in Milwaukee we got a $10 voucher that almost paid for a meal. Nothing so far on way back. Next time I'm flying Southwest! https://www.airlinequality.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=372244&action=edit#edit_timestamp

### "treat you with respect"
Toronto to Punta Cana. My wife and I have been going to Dominican Republic and Cuba for years and always fly Sunwing Airlines. They treat you with respect and will do anything to help you. We have never had a bad flight with Sunwing. The flight attendants help make you comfortable and make your trip enjoyable. We will always fly with Sunwing.

### "not be using them in future"
Calgary to Mazatlan via Puerto Vallarta. We had booked our vacation in November with Sunwing Airlines. One of the primary reasons for choosing Sunwing and the destination (Mazatlan) was because of the convenience of the travel time and nonstop flight. We were advised 2 weeks prior that the flight time had been changed with the flight now being rerouted through Puerto Vallarta. We were unhappy with this change to our itinerary and contacted Sunwing to see if we could cancel/change our flight, and were told we could not. They have not responded to our emails. As we had to now disembark the aircraft in Puerto Vallarta, pick up our luggage, clear customs, recheck luggage, this added at least 3 hours to our flight, as we had to fly over Mazatlan south to Puerto Vallarta, before heading back north to Mazatlan. We will not be using them in the future, and only wished I had done more research before booking with them initially.

### "didn't contribute to a great vacation"
We only flew with Sunwing Airlines from Toronto to Montego Bay because of their cancellation policy. 30 minutes late to take off. Upon landing there was another plane at our gate so we sat in the plane for 20 minutes. Went to pick up our bags - a 45 minute wait because Sunwing had 3 flights in at the same time. Good planning. Apparently Sunwing has only 1 crew to unload all these planes. Did these issues ruin our vacation. No, but they didn't contribute to an otherwise great vacation.

### "very pleasant and attentive"
I fly with Sunwing Airlines every year for my vacation, and flight attendants have always been very pleasant and attentive. I have only ever had one minor delay and that was due to a weather issue which was out of the airline's control. 95% of the time they have been on time and I fly them a lot.

### "pleasant flight attendants"
We recently flew Toronto to Holguin using Sunwing Airlines. Free choice of sandwich both ways, sparkling wine on the way, choice of free soft drink on way back. Pleasant flight attendants. The Sunwing staff in Cuba were awesome. We had to access medical support in Holquin and switch our flight dates and the staff at Playa Pesguero were amazing. They helped with food to take to the hospital, visited us there and assisted with insurance claims and new flight tickets. Flight so early that we had to leave for airport basically in middle of night (3:30 am). As soon as we were in the air it was announced by an attendant that we would be turning back as there was an instrumentation problem. Then within one minute is was announced that we would be continuing. Found that a little scary - what was the problem that it was solved so quickly? On landing back at Pearson Airport we sat on the plane for at least twenty minutes as there was no gate ready to receive us. Why did that happen? At least the pilot apologized repeatedly for the inconvenience. Too bad that Sunwing wouldn't let us travel back with our new tickets at no extra charge as the plane had so many empty seats anyway.

### "would not fly Sunwing again"
This review is regarding my Vancouver to Toronto Christmas trip. Vancouver to Toronto Dec 23 scheduled 11:25 pm, actual take off 12:30 am. Above average crew, relatively newer plane (guessing 5 to 10 years old). However, delayed 1 hour due to very slow check in process. Arrived nearly 2 hours before scheduled time with only about 50 passengers in front. Took nearly 80 minutes to check me in. Airline is also not ready to charge for baggage. Only had one combined debit machine for the 4 operating kiosks creating a secondary line for payment. Mix up with previously checked in seating resulted in an unadvertised move from front of plane to row 30. Upon arrival, baggage was made available nearly 50 minutes after arrival at gate. Toronto to Vancouver Jan 1st was scheduled 8:45 pm, changed flight number and time to WG863 / 9pm. Actual take off at 10:50 pm. A great crew experience. No checked bag this time to avoid line ups. Plane sat across gate for nearly 1.5 hours without any explanation. Flight crew arrived on time and waiting with all passengers. Plane was finally made available for boarding about 10:25 pm. This was the only scheduled Sunwing flight but a second flight was added so this flight was bumped without notice and flight number altered. No explanation was given as to why plane was late. The second added plane/flight took off nearly on time prior to the original flight already scheduled and accounted for due to regular scheduling which made no sense. Poor practice at gate continuously misled passengers with incremental increases in departure time. For instance, at 9:18 pm, they were reporting a 9:15 take off. At 9:38, they change take off time to 9:40. Likely to avoid hefty fines for a nearly 2 hour delay. Management of the airline is unable to provide any positive experience for passengers. Only bright spot for the entire trip was the crew that were pleasant, enthusiastic and attentive. I would not fly Sunwing again.

### "chose to take a train home"
Flight to Toronto delayed in Jamaica for 2 hrs due to winter storm in Toronto. No problem. Flight to Toronto, staff not friendly. Couldn't land in Toronto due to weather and rerouted to Ottawa. They had no gate available for us there so we had to wait on tarmac. Was not allowed to use the washroom while waiting as we weren't gated. People started using washroom anyway. We were stranded on tarmac for 3 hours (11pm - 2am) and not once was offered any water, blankets etc. Staff did not come around to check on anyone, even those of us who had young kids. One man was caught smoking in bathroom so he was arrested. We had to wait for them to get him off plane, find his luggage (at least he got off the plane after an hour of waiting). Was given excuse after excuse as to why we couldn't get off the plane (had to wait to refuel; had to wait for plane to be de-iced). Overall, the staff was rude and non apologetic. Was finally let off plane, then delayed again for 1.5 hrs in the Ottawa airport for getting out luggage. Sunwing offered to put us up at a hotel for the nite but we chose to take a train home at our expense just so we didn't have to deal with them anymore.

### "thanks but no thanks"
Calgary to Santa Clara, Cuba return. Poor service all around! We booked our vacation through Sunwing Airlines based on flights and cost. We were supposed to fly out of Calgary at 7:05am on December 30. We got an email the night before at 10:00 telling us there was a delay in our flight and was rescheduled for 12:35pm. When we called we couldn't get a straight answer as to why the flight was delayed. We were told by one person it was weather, another it was mechanical and finally security issues. We then woke up the day of travel on to find another email saying the flight was yet again delayed another hour. We were lucky as some of the passengers didnt even know about the delay and showed up for our flight at 4:30 am. When we go to the ticket counter to check in more excuses as to the delay. Finally one of the other passengers complained and after reading their contract demanded that they follow through with their policy and every passenger was entitled to a $75 voucher. We finally departed at the time we were supposed to be arriving. The plane was old there was barely any leg room and I'm 5'1". Once aboard there was a issue with my seat in which they issued to myself and someone else. Seeing we paid extra to choose our seats they moved the other passenger to the back of the plane. During the flight the attendants were not helpful in the least. They did give us all the voucher but didn't bother to inform us that this can be used towards any excursions during our stay just that it needed to be used with in 1 year from date of issue on any other travel package. Needless to say after this experience the last company I'm going to travel with again is Sunwing, so thanks but no thanks.

### "never fly Sunwing again"
Edmonton to Varadero return with Sunwing Airlines and by far the worst airline I have flown. The planes were outdated both to and from Cuba. The seats are brutally uncomfortable, hardly recline and the leg room is also terrible. The  staff were incapable of seating my girl and I together even though there was plenty of available seating together as we where one of the first to the counter in Cuba and there was no priority reserve seating. My grandmother was forced to sit at the rear of the airplane which is very difficult due to her mobility issues. These issues were clearly addressed and understood by Sunwing over 3 months in advance of the trip and yet they where still unwilling to help. I will never fly a Sunwing aircraft again.

### "flights were different experiences"
Toronto to Montego Bay return on Sunwing. I was not impressed with my Sunwing experience. After waiting in line for 30mins to check-in for our departure flight we discovered they didn't have the correct name for my husband in the system. They had his first name last and last name first. The agent assisting us was very helpful, even though it took another 30mins to resolve. Due to these delays we may have been late for our flight, however we later learned that our flight was delayed 3 hours. The check-out experience was even worse. First our shuttle from the hotel to the airport was late, and it took 20mins to load luggage since they didn't have room for everyone to fit on the bus. Some people had to take a cab by themselves! Then once we arrived, we had to wait in line at Sangster airport for over 1.5hrs to check our baggage. When we got to the counter, there was an issue again with my mom and cousin-in-law. They both didn't exist in the computer system! That took a few extra mins to resolve as well. The flight to and the flight from the Montego Bay were different experiences. The flight to Montego Bay had staff that were very friendly and attentive. It was timely, we received 2 refreshment servings, and they were quick to collect garbage. The flight from Montego Bay was delayed (probably due to the delay with checking baggage), and they had staff that were not very friendly. They didn't smile, they only came around once with refreshments (which was about 2 hours into our 4 hour flight), and collected our garbage 30mins before landing. The audio on the plane ride home kept having issues. They had to restart their system about 3 or 4 times, and still my audio did not work.

### "they really do not care"
The Sunwings Airline experience was dreadful. The original flight to Cancun was scheduled for 5:00 p.m. Approximately 3 months after we booked it, and after I had purchased non-refundable connecting flights for the whole family, they changed the time of the flight to 3:30pm. (requiring us to be at the airport at 1:30pm). The connecting flight and ground transportation would get us there at approximately 2:30pm, so we had to change the non-refundable flights. When I told SunWings about this, they said, "We can change your flight if you pay an additional $100/person). Instead, I convinced the connecting airline to change our flights for an additional $100/person ($300). We had to get up at 3:00 a.m. to get to the airport, fly to Michigan, take ground transport to Lansing, and make sure we got to the gate. We got there at 1:30pm - and waited. And, waited. No one had information. The many vacationers were told different departing times (3:30 and 5:00) so no one was sure what the actual time was. And, SunWings staff didn't seem to know either. Then, their plane did not come in and we finally took off at 8:40 p.m. The flight itself was without incident. And, we got over it. We were going to Cancun! The return flight was equally terrible. I contacted SunWing 24 hour in advance. I was told that everything was on schedule and the plane would leave at noon. We booked our taxi and arrived at the Cancun airport at 10:00am - and, waited. No one was at their desk. We started searching for help. No one knew anything. Finally, after 30 minutes, we found someone who told us the flight had left at 9:30 am. and that we had missed the flight. They told me the flight was scheduled for noon. They confirmed 24 hours earlier. We asked when the next flight would be - Answer: Next Saturday. Seriously? Wait around for a week. We insisted that we must get back to school and work. So, they agreed to put us on another flight that would be "close" to our destination. They flew us to Rockford Illinois (a 5 hour drive) to land at 11:30pm and wanted to charge us $300 for the privilege. (Note: They did decide to waive the fee). We were forced to pay taxi fares, hotel fees and car rentals and, after hassle and stress, we arrived home one day late. After the hassle to change the flight, we were assured that the new boarding would be glitch-free. No. Not at all. When we arrived 2 hours in advance to get our boarding pass, the representative said, "You are not booked for this flight. Where is your confirmation? And, we had to argue about this all over again. Finally, after 40 minutes, she found an email that informed her that we were to be boarded on this flight. Seriously? Can't even get their act together to treat the passengers that they abused nicely the second time around. When we were at the Cancun airport, we waited next to a woman who told us that she traveled to Cancun every single Christmas. Every year, she said, I sit in the airport and listen to people tell horror stories about Sunwings Airlines and the terrible things that happen to them. Other people began to chime in with SunWing Horror stories. Never fly this airline. They really do not care.

### "worst experience ever"
Vancouver to Toronto. Worst experience ever with Sunwing Airlines. Ticket was confirmed and booked but did not show up in their systems. I have to call in over and over again to get it sorted out then another hour waiting for them to confirm with the company at checkin. The system that they use is ancient and their user interface is subpar. On flight, there are zero power outlets. The prices are around $100 cheaper than the competition at the worst times. It is not worth the trouble going with an airline that delays  their flights with little to no flexibility for a change if something comes up. Usually there won't be a flight or two to popular routes a day.

### "won't be using again"
Fort Lauderdale to Toronto with Sunwing Airlines. If you dont mind major delays, no entertainmemt system, zero legroom for anyone taller than 5'5" then this is the airline for you. Staff are ok but the airline is run like a joke though. Won't be using again. Leaving for our trip we were delayed 1 hour before boarding 1/2 hour at the gate and another 1/2 hour at destination spent circling the airport. Leaving our flight was delayed fr 12:30 to 1:30 then 2:20 and finally 3:00. Why can't they keep a schedule?

### "worst experience ever"
Calgary to Cancun, and Sunwing Airlines was the worst experience ever. Booked package for 1 week to Cancun with sunwing. Departure was supposed to be at 11 am. Went to the airport to find that flight was delayed to 14:00. Then delayed again till 14:30, and delayed for third time to 7:30 pm. Sunwing rep told me its a mechanical problem, another told me its bad weather. Obviously the second person was lying because Westjet and Air Canada flights took off on time. Practically we lost one paid night at the resort because of this nasty airline. They don't care. Last time flying this airline.

### "check in is comical"
Toronto to Vancouver. Unfortunately we found ourselves booked on Sunwing Airlines. Something we will not be pleased to see in future itineraries. Seemingly the airline plans on departing late at their control. Flight check in is comical with one line where everyone must have all bags weighed and tagged only to be sent to another line to pay for bags which is an experience all to its own - hand writing receipts for every single passenger is not a requirement in this day. A few lessons on efficiency will go far to improve passenger experience.

### "rude, almost arrogant"
Punta Cana to Toronto. Our Sunwing Airlines flight was delayed 2 hours no fault of the airline. The issues began trying to board the aircraft, crew were disorganized and lacking compassion towards hot and tired passengers. My wife after waiting an additional 20 minutes went to use the restroom,  had only entered the lavatory a short time when two crew members began repeated banging on the door to have her quickly return to her seat. Upon my wife's return to her seat we still waited an additional 30 minutes. No waters or beverages were offered to sooth dehydrated passengers for a flight now over 2 hours delayed. I found the crew rude, almost arrogant with little people skills. We pre order our duty free the week before only to be told it was not available - they had a week to organize this. There needs to be more competition and selection in the Punta Cana market.

### "went very well"
Winnipeg to Varadero, Cuba. My first experience traveled with Sunwing Airlines went very well, on time departure both ways, smooth flights, quick check-in at the airports, friendly staff and attendants, baggage, seat good with no problems. I loved a warm sandwich serving with a champagne, that's fantastic. Thank you Sunwing vacation.

### "an excellent experience"
Toronto to Saint Maarten. This was an excellent experience from our on time departure to our early return. We pre booked seats in row six which suited us well (aisle and middle). Leg room was adequate even for my 6ft tall husband. Staff were friendly and attentive. The plane was clean and the food was fine for the 4 hour flight. We would definitely fly Sunwing again. It was a great deal!

### "helpful and pleasant"
Toronto to Fort Lauderdale. My first experience with Sunwing was fantastic from arriving on the plane to landing in Fort Lauderdale. We were looking for a flight on a one way to Fort Lauderdale at a discount rate. We enjoyed the flight, the stewardess was very helpful and pleasant to deal with. Thank you Sunwing for your wonderful and a smooth flight with no problems.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
BookED with Sunwing 3 months in advance FROM Montreal to Fort Lauderdale, documents indicated that baggage was included. Sunwing changed its baggage policy and tried to charge everyone. After a fuss the supervisor gave in and we were not charged. The problem was everyone was delayed because of Sunwing trying to make a few extra bucks. The plane was delayed one hour because of the passengers being held up because Sunwing was trying to collect baggage fees and everyone wasted an hour of vacation siting on the plane waiting for passengers. Substandard airline.

### "once again, our flight was delayed"
My wife, 7 month old daughter and I flew Sunwing Airlines on December 7, 2015 going to the Maya Riviera. The plane was delayed 2 hours and the gate was changed 3 times without any explanation as to what was going on. On the flight, just prior to landing after the bar was closed, the airline had the nerve to then go around with bottles of water that you could purchase for 3 dollars. When someone asked them for a glass of water, they had told them that the bar was closed but they could purchase a bottle. Upon arrival at Cancun airport, we then had to wait 30-45 minutes for our transportation to arrive, once again without an explanation. On the way home, our transportation was 30 minutes late on picking us up to go to the airport. We had to approach a Sunwing representative to find out where he was. Once arriving at the airport, there was a massive lineup as Sunwing does not have any self check-in computers available, however the competition WestJet and Air Canada do. Not to mention, there were 3 different Sunwing flights all trying to check in at the same time. The line up was so long it exceeded the designated line up area and started forming a curved line in the public area of the airport causing much confusion as to where people should lineup. We approached one of the Sunwing representatives to let them know that we are a family with a small child and if there was another lineup we could stand in and they said no. The representative did offer us the option of paying more money to upgrading to Elite in order to bypass the lineup. So, we waited in line an hour with not even coming close to approaching the start of the designated line up when a representative then approached us to allow us to check-in through the elite area with no charge, as they finally realized that they should let families with kids bypass the lineup. Once again, our flight was delayed by 25 minutes as we were waiting for people to get through the lineup and board the plane, which in turn put us behind in the line for take off. Our plane was supposed to land at 7.50 and we did not get into the airport until 8.15. I used to fly Sunwing in the past and have never experienced anything like this with regards to flight and transportation, however, this was enough for me to look at other alternatives when booking my next vacation such as Air Canada or WestJet. In the past I have had issues with the hotels and the Sunwing representatives being nowhere to be found.

### "lies after lies"
Sunwing Airlines plane touched down at 10pm in Saskatoon doing damage to the gear apparently. Left us on the plane with no detail on what they were planning to do with us. Finally got taken into airport where they ordered pizza for everyone, definitely not enough as me and my husband never got a piece. At this point they were looking for another plane to get us home to Edmonton. Finally got informed to get comfy as a plane would be coming at 5am for us, which was delayed as well. It was just lies after lies after hour after hour, when they should have just put us all up in a hotel room for the duration of the night and flew us out in the morning. They gave us a $15 voucher which was basically for tim hortons on the other side of a security and a $150 voucher to fly with them again. I never accepted this voucher as there is no way we will fly with this airline again.

### "terrible ending to a great trip"
I've been on 3 Sunwing Airlines vacations, each one was worse than the previous. We booked a direct flight from Edmonton to Huatulco Mexico, when we arrived at the airport we were told that we would be having a lay over in Saskatoon without notice. We are now delayed on our connecting flight. A terrible ending to a great family trip. If you have a choice to fly with a different airline then I suggest you do so.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
I was not impressed with the Sunwing Airlines staff on the flight to Cayo Coco, Cuba. It was very apparent that the stewardess had no interest in making this a joyous flight, they spent time behind the curtain as much as possible only appearing when absolutely necessary. These stewardess had no interest in interacting with passengers. I was not the only person who felt this way.

### "a horrible experience "
Never again, On the way to Punta Cana, 3 hour delay. Had to switch planes due to some radio issue. Way home? Sun Wing reps in airport, were horrible. Did not seem to know that elite passengers get extra weight. Had to wait for a supervisor to come, just to tell staff that we were right. Flight was delayed 6 hours. Had to move people around due to tail weight. No movies - system was down. Had to wait on airplance for them to fuel it and then told not to put on our seatbelt in case we need to evacuate in a hurry. Had to wait for paperwork to come to pilots. 6 hour delay and no paperwork ready. All in all, a horrible experience with Sunwing. Delays bothways. Issues both ways.

### "plane left on time"
I tried checking in online 4 hours before flight time but still couldn't get into Sunwing's website (most other airlines allow one to check in 24 hours before flight time). Staff was very efficient at the airport. The plane left on time (going and coming). The food was minimal (but there was food). The old entertainment system showed movies that didn't appeal to me but I couldn't see the screen anyway so it didn't matter.

### "I would fly again"
All in all, it was a good flight from Vancouver to Mazatlna. I didn't expect a whole lot due to thee price I paid, which was a good deal for my week of fun. The food wasn't the greatest, seats were small, but that's okay, it was only a short flight. I would fly with Sunwing Airlines again.

### "you get what you pay for"
For the most part, it's a cheap airline, you get what you pay for in this sense. Food is average, entertainment is average, comfort is average. I'm writing this to speak of the horrid customer service I've experienced since they lost my luggage. I flew direct but my flight took on luggage from YVR which mine seemed to be taken to as I didn't get it. This was confirmed by a friend of a friend whom worked for a different airline in YVR. 56 hours later and Sunwing still cannot locate my luggage. I have told them where it is but still they have not located it. Other airlines cannot contact them, the only way I could actually "talk" with someone was through social media.

### "baggage policy is asinine"
The seats were comfortable (thought a bit more leg room would have been appreciated). The flight attendants were friendly and helpful. The passenger agents who did the check-in in Montego Bay were professional, helpful and above all they had common sense. I wish I could say the same thing about the Toronto passenger agents. I have travelled to 24 countries on numerous airlines. I am also a former flight attendant. So for me to take the time to write a bad review about an airline says a lot. This airlines's baggage policy is asinine. The wording was unclear so I thought that we were allowed 2 pieces of luggage of up to 20 kg each. It was a total of 20 kg. I ended up being overweight and since the overweight fee was a predatory $20 per extra kilogram, I had no choice but to leave my suitcase with my riding gear in storage at the airport in Toronto. This set me back $55 plus tax. I had to take a practically empty carry on case on board. No way was I going to check a laptop and risk damage so I was compelled to carry the laptop case and power supply in my hands, put my camera case around my neck and loop my pillow around one of my arms. This is where the lack of common sense of the passenger agents comes in. Please explain to me how this makes any sense as it does not change the total weight on the aircraft. Second area of concern is the seat selection policy. WestJet and Air Canada allow you to check-in 24 hours before your flight. With Sunwings it's 4 hours. How in the world does that make any sense. So while you are travelling to the airport with a zillion things on your mind you have to do your seat selection? I have got to say that while I had a fabulous time in Jamaica, the experience with the airline really got things off to a bad start.

### "a professional crew"
I don't have any complaints about Sunwing Airlines. The flight crew arrived on time and we departed to our destination on time. The crew were professional. On our flight returning to the U.S. we actually left 20-30 minutes early. Again with a professional crew. I would fly Sunwing again.

### "No wifi, old plane, uncomfortable"
We were scheduled to leave the airport (Toronto) at 4:20pm on a Saturday. Sunwing Airlines called us the night before and told us that the plane was delayed until 12:30am on the Sunday! We asked to have our seat put together on the plane in order to be at all acceptive of the delay (this was after we demanded a refund of some kind or a free excursion on the vacation, to which they refused) and they told me that they could not do that because "people pay for that". Well I paid to leave at 4:20pm on Saturday so that I could have 7 full days in Cuba. With this delay I only got 6 full days in Cuba. Not only that, we didn't even end up leaving at 12:30am on the Sunday. The crew didn't even show up until 12:45am. Then we looked at the board and it was updated to a 12:55am departure. No update over the PA, no update on our phones (which we got the first time) not even an update on their website. We didn't leave the airport until 1:45am that morning. I guess the $20 coupon for the airport food that they gave us made it all better. We couldn't buy booze or duty free or anything from the general store. 9 hours of my time for $20 worth of overpriced food. Thanks Sunwing, you really know how to make your customers want to come back. No wifi, old plane, uncomfortable and small.

### "long delays without notice"
I have had the misfortune of flying with Sunwing Airlines on multiple occasions. The third time was not the charm. Each time, there have been long delays without any notice. Once it happened on both the flight down ($25 voucher for dinner), with a 3.5 hour delay and three 3 hour delays on the return trip from Varadero. The most recent was a departure scheduled to leave around midnight and showing on the departure schedule as being "on time", only to be turned away at check-in time and told it was leaving the next day.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
We are scheduled to leave October 2nd 2015 and are already not happy with Sunwing Airlines service ! We booked on July 27th, they informed us yesterday that they will not honour the direct flights we booked, neither the seats we chose with additional fee of $80. 5.5 hours of additional flight and are losing one day at the beach. Sunwing Airlines don't want to make any changes because their policy is you can change at 45 days notice with $ 50 fee. We are at 20 day. Very clever, they don't give any chance at all for their customers to modify their trip. Spent over 45 minutes over the phone with them and only thing they kept repeating: Sunwing Airlines policies!

### "I see why people complain about them"
Toronto to Freeport return with Sunwing Airlines. Flight down on September 5 was good but return on September 12 was bad. Checked the board at the hotel and all was good saying be picked up at resort at 7 am and flight was leaving at 10ish. Went to check out on Saturday morning from hotel and found out from someone else that the flight was delayed until 8:40 pm - no call from Sunwing Airlines. Didn't get home until Sunday at midnight so for everyone it was close to 15 hours delay and all we got was a $75 voucher for our next flight. Do you think I want to use them again - no way. I now see why people complain about them. There was no explanation.

### "we were very disappointed"
This all inclusive vacation started with a 7 hour delay at Toronto Pearson Airport. Compensation from Sunwing Vacations for losing most of our first afternoon of sun and an evening of vacation time at our resort was two food vouchers (no alcohol) for $20.00 each. Sleeping on the carpet was optional while you waited, but those airport seats get pretty uncomfortable after awhile. We were very disappointed and our concerns fell upon deaf ears. They don't seem to care once you've paid for your trip. Do yourself a favour and find an airline with a larger fleet (Air Canada Vacations for example) so when "mechanical problems" arise, a replacement plane might be available quicker. When you pay for seven days you should receive seven days? Also, not that in this era of cost cuts we could have had better, the plane seemed old, small tv monitors (some didn't work) and very cramped. Service on board was not  least impressive. The "champagne service" advertised was served in a 1 ounce plastic cup. Very Special Indeed!

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
Do not use Sunwing. Horrible web check, horrible seats. Delayed 2.5 hours but when I checked 4 hours before flight it said on time. When asked upon arrival at airport she admitted it was something from last night so not sure why they didn't inform customers properly. No champagne as indicated by the sales agent we booked with. Overall just not a great experience for our first time. Would not recommend to others. Then they edover 2 hours to serve a drink. Then started the movie on the way there and back with 1.5 hours left in flight so neither movie finished prior to landing. Why bother then.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
I was nervous to board this flight because of all these reviews, but it was suprisingly good. No delays, but just a gate change by 2 gates. The food was, okay to say the least. They brought out beverages too (Coke, Diet Coke, ginger ale, Sprite, tonic water, water) and they were pretty good. I think they'll let you have the whole can if you ask them. Very nice interactive staff, they weren't rude at all. The movie audio was too loud. I know that the plane can be noisy, but it doesn't need to be that loud. It was pretty good. In fact, our flight was shorter than expected. It was supposed to be 5hr 5min, but it was 4hr 30min. I guess it just depends on what crew you have.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
Terrible airline. Canadians are sometimes stuck using them because of the limited flights to Cuba. They left us in Cuba on our vacation because the plane took off early due to a time change which they knew was happening but failed to inform us about, even though they had our email address.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
Our flight leaving Toronto was originally scheduled to depart at 8.15 am on August 1st, 2015. Upon arrival at the airport at 5.5 am we were told that the flight was delayed 4 hours. We were handed a meal voucher worth $15 each. By the time we took off, we were delayed 5 hours. To make matters worse, our return flight on August 8th, 2015 was delayed 5 hours. Instead of arriving in Toronto at 6.15 pm, we actually touched down after midnight. No reason was provided for the delays and to make matters worse, Sunwing did not provide us with meal vouchers in Punta Cana and even had the nerve to charge us for snacks on the flight!

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
Chose this airline because it was $300 cheaper than Air Canada or WestJet. Never again. All legs were delayed by up to 5 hrs. On return, part of the delay was due to staff leaving the plane at the wrong gate. Seats excruciatingly uncomfortable. Stuffed in like sardines. Avoid at all cost.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
Used Sunwing about a year ago for my parents and they loved it. But this time around was a nightmare. There are 2 separate encounters in the last couple days. My friends were flying Sunwing Vancouver to Toronto on the 6th. They get to the airport and find the flight is delayed an hour. Then delayed it another 1hr, than they come in and push it another 3 hours bringing their total wait time at the airport 5 hours. Now on August 8 my wife and baby daughter are flying Sunwing Toronto to Vancouver booked in advance, most airlines allow luggage for the baby but not these guys, they said they'll charge $10 a kg for any extra luggage or I can upgrade for their Elite first class for $50 and get an additional 10kg. I agreed and paid. The lady also said because of the upgrade the baby can have her stroller shipped at no charge. Now when we get to the airport the lady says we have to pay $20 for the stroller because it's heavier than most strollers. Than we get to the gate and realize the flight has been delayed from 8:10-11:30 (3.5 hrs) so we checked in anyway. Than by the time the plane gets there at 12 to be exact we end up sitting in the runway till 1:30 before take off, a total of 5.5 hours waisted. Wife gets in the plane to so called first class, it's just a seat in a front row. Now after a long 5 hr flight finally making it to Vancouver, wife goes to pick up her luggage and notices the stroller is missing. The next nightmare will begin because from the look and sound of their so called staff this is gonna take a very long time to resolve. I fly a lot within Canada and always take Air Canada and West jet. Gave these guys a shot and they failed miserably twice in 2 days.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
First when I check in they say the flight is delayed 3 hours, with no reason given. Then an hour before boarding they delay it another 4 hours. So all in all 7 hour delay. Sunwing Airlines refused to pay for a hotel for anyone, because it has to be 8 hours. It was actually delayed 7 hours, 15 mins total. The explanation was because a crew member got sick so they had to wait for the morning crew to come in. The flight was originally at 11:15pm and was delayed until 6am. Never would I recommend Sunwing Airlines to anyone - they give u a $75 voucher to spend on another flight with them, are you kidding me!

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
Online seat selection was broken the day before our departure, we had purchased the "premium" package to select the seats in advance. In order to use this package I had to actually call them instead of doing it online. Unlike most airlines online check-in is available only 4 hours before departure. The online check-in process is the worst I have seen - you cannot check in everyone on your booking at the same time, you have to do it for each family member, even for children. At the airport it was not too bad, just like other budget airlines. The check-in line was long but that's where the premium package is useful. The flight from Montreal to Holguin was OK. The aircraft was relatively large but the seat spacing was extremely small. We are not talking about the centimeters between your knees and the seat in front of you, we are talking about the centimeters between your nose and that seat. If the passenger in front of you reclines, you simply have no choice but to recline too. If you go to the bathroom and they start serving food or drinks - you will not get back to your seat until the cart passes it. Food and drink service is ok. I have to admit that the food was provided and it it was quite good. The flight back (WG645) was terrible. First, the drink service was worse, they did not even have coffee. Next, the cabin temperature. It was very cold. Considering that the families were flying from Cuba (+35C) with kids it was just terrible. Many people complained but nothing was done to make it warmer. Next, the flight was late to Montreal by ~40 minutes, it could not get to the gate. Finally, instead of unloading the gate checked-in strollers they have unloaded them with the rest of the luggage. Lots of fun with small kids getting through 1-hour-plus waiting line at the border control and the customs.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
We were allowed 2 free checked bags apiece. They gave us a free glass of champagne and a tasty little mini sub on the way down, and free red wine and a yummy pizza pocket on the way back. We got to watch a movie, and the nonstop flight (both to and fro) was uneventful, and pretty much on time. The staff were friendly and they even did all the announcements in French, as well as English. I'd definitely fly Sunwing again.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
First time, horror stories, but Canada has little choice in flights. Much prefer WestJet. Going down, was fine. On time, service OK. On Return flight, sure enough, delay. Only found out by checking online! Their rep at resort did not believe me, and had to go confirm the delay. Then another one hour delay, then two more - total just under 4 hours, so they didn't have to give food vouchers out. I was prepared, knowing about all their delays, so went with the flow! Was lucky to get later check out at resort. Taxes are rip off. Must pay to books seats in advance, out of Mexico for return flight. Will avoid them if possible.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
I read terrible reviews of this airline and was not expecting much. To my surprise this was one of the best airlines I have flown. We did leave late both in going to my destination and returning, (1 hour each time) and that was not fun. The stewardess were so friendly, attentive, and I felt they went the extra mile to ensure the passengers had a pleasant flight. I am tall and I was worried about the leg room, but I had plenty of leg room. The seats were wide enough and my family was comfortable during our 3.5 hour flight. We had champaign on our flight to our destination, it was okay, a nice touch. There was a meal which really was nothing more than a grown-up hot pocket. It was tasty, but nothing to write home about. All in all I would certainly fly with Sunwing again.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
We were hesitant about flying with Sunwing after reading all the awful, negative reviews. However, we were pleasantly surprised! Our outbound flight left about 15 minutes late, but no big deal. The aircraft was clean and appeared new. The staff were helpful and friendly. As far as seat comfort goes, I found the seats to be typical of most airlines. There were family friendly in-flight movies but the headsets cost $4 each. Our return flight actually left a few minutes early and arrived back home 30 minutes ahead of schedule. Again, the staff were very helpful and friendly. Sodas, juices, water, coffee/tea, and wine were served at no charge. Beer and mixed drinks were offered for an additional charge. Snacks were offered at an additional charge. They also served a hot bistro pastry at no charge that was only so-so but hey, this is airline food not a 4 star restaurant. We did not choose the elite service but they do board elite passengers first, from a separate line and they are seated first at the front the aircraft. Would I fly Sunwing again? Absolutely!

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
Flight delayed almost 4hrs and they offer a snack voucher worth $15. It's almost 10pm. Only a few stores open. Missing a day of work due to this delay and they said this is the best they can do. Choose another airline and save yourself a headache!

The only reason we went with Sunwing after reading several bad reviews was the decent price. We were aware that Sunwing was notorious for delays, but decided to take the risk. What a mistake we made. Our original departure time was 3.45 pm. Under an hour before we were supposed to board, we were told that there was about an hour and a half delay. Not too bad yet. However, as time passed, the delay got pushed further and further, until finally, our new departure time was 1.00 am. This was a complete nightmare for all passengers, including those who had very young children. Instead of telling us right away that our plane would be delayed until such a late time, they kept us at the airport, waiting, with very little information as to why the delay happened. Compensation" was $20 meal vouchers that were useless at the time, since most of the restaurants in our area were shut down for the night. We also got $75 vouchers for excursions, but it still did not make up for a day of our vacation ruined. Two weeks later, on our way back to Toronto from Holguin, our plane was in a similar situation. First a four hour delay. No explanation. The delay once again got pushed to later times, until it was over five hours of waiting in our hotel lobby without air conditioning. New departure time was 1.45 am. In conclusion, we will never fly with Sunwing again, as it seems that customers are the last thing they worry about. With huge delays and no communication between the airline and the passengers, Sunwing is not a good option in any shape or form.

We were delayed 8 hours. During this time we were not kept informed of the status of our flight. We were just expected to wait. We even boarded the plane and were later asked to de-board due to mechanical issues after waiting in the plane for 2 hours. Due to the delay we did not have a ride home. Therefore we had to pay for a very expensive cab ride. Of course they refused to compensate us claiming that any delays are not the responsibility of the airline. The only compensation was a meal voucher which we had to use within 45 min or we were out of luck. And good luck speaking to a live person at customer service. There is no such thing. There is absolutely no way we would ever fly Sunwing again. All the negative reviews are true. I'm not even sure how they are still in business.

I just landed in the Bahamas. I was very worried about the airline especially after reading all the negative reviews. My flight was great. The plane left on time and the staff were excellent. The plane was clean and appeared to be new. You get what you paid for. If you want champagne service go to another airline. For a family of 5 it fit the bill and I would fly with them again!

Took Sunwing for the first time from YUL to VRA. The airline by itself is ok compared to the competition, some food was free. But the headsets had to be paid for and no PTV available.

Our non-stop return flight from Jamaica to Toronto was changed mid vacation to include a "stopover" in Punta Cana. On boarding we were told we would be dropping off passengers to Punta Cana before heading to Toronto, adding an additional 1.5 hrs to our flight, including an additional takeoff and landing. In fact we were late leaving due the luggage needing to be re-balanced. On arrival in Punta Cana, approx. 20 passengers got off. Apparently they had been diverted from Toronto to Jamaica to spend the night before continuing to their destination of Punta Cana the following morning, due to their flight not being full enough? When the passengers had left the plane we were further delayed by more rebalancing of luggage and refuelling. Re-fuelling, and rebalancing completed, imagine our shock with yet a further delay as Sunwing made some additional cash by loading some fresh fruits and vegetable cargo onto to our plane! Then some additional unloading as they backed some of the cargo off of the plane as they apparently loaded too much. All said and done we sat on the runway for two hours, with a plane full of passengers and young children. We were not permitted to leave the plane, it was very warm and crowded. We were able to use the washrooms, but the line-ups were long and the facilities very messy due to the overuse. No food or beverages were provided during this time and many of the children were cranky, hot and tired resulting in passenger/parent altercations breaking out all over the plane. It was very quickly becoming a very hostile environment. Additionally the inflight entertainment system had stopped functioning mid flight so all passengers could do during the two hour torture session was stare at the clock ticking off a lengthy delay and stare out the window at a very inept airport crew dropping luggage onto the Tarmac. The flight crew lacked a single drop of empathy at passengers comments, in fact when I asked what they were going to do for us to compensate us for our time and discomfort the response I received was that "they would get us to our destination safely". So in the end when we finally took off and reached our destination of Toronto, our 4 hr direct flight turned into over 8 hrs, with a 3 hr pre-flight arrival at the airport making our journey over 11 hrs. We were provided with a snack and a glass of wine, and a sandwich. Disgusting, negligent, irresponsible, unacceptable. I will walk, or crawl on a vacation before flying Sunwing airlines ever again.

WG 511 May 9. WG 512 May 16-17. Elite must mean something different to Sunwing. $50 each way to upgrade to a wider seat with more leg room and would not stay upright for take off and landing. The stewardesses must have known this as they didn't even ask me to return to the upright position. The inflight "champagne" service is actually a plastic cup of crappy sparkling wine. $3 bottles of water but shortly after that free juice or cups of water with the breakfast sandwich. Fine it's just the flight not the whole vacation.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
On April 26 checked in for a flight from Toronto to Puerto Plata. The check in agent was not friendly and very direct. She stated that my mother could not check in with us however did not indicate why. I informed her we were all on the same booking and that my mother did not speak fluent English. Our seats were selected for us without asking us where we would like to sit (fwd mid aft). When I booked the flight I was informed that my 2 year old daughter would receive a child's meal and a kids backpack with activities. I was informed on the outbound flight that there were no child's meals for my daughter and that her only option was the cheese pizza that is offered to all passengers. My daughter at no time was offered the Kids backpack. On May 3 Puerto Plata to Toronto the check in process was a mess there was no order and it took forever to check in. As inbound special meals were being offered in flight I enquired about my daughters child's meal I was informed there was no child's meals and only the cheese pizzaâ- again! I asked the flight attendant if my daughter could have her meal as they had now commenced serving the food. The flight attendant asked the manager came back and stated as per the manager my daughter would have to wait and that she did not wish to skip rows. I informed the flight attendant that those passengers who had ordered special meals ie: vegetarian meal had already received their meals. She stated she was following direction from the manager. Landing into Toronto my daughter was struggling and was crying and screaming. I was holding my daughter to soothe her when the in-flight manager abruptly informed me that my daughter had to be in her seat seatbelt fastened. I informed the manager that I was attempting to calm my daughter down and was trying my best when she indicated that my daughter would have to be in her seat and that if she did not take her seat that she would have to inform the Captain that the cabin was not secure and that we would not be able to land. I would not suggest Sunwing to a family/friend. This airline lacks in professionalism and customer service.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
We travelled SunWing for the first time on April 27th to Cuba. We decided to upgrade to the 'Elite' service as it was our honeymoon. We were completely disappointed by Sunwing and the staff at Pearson. Started off with the 'priority' baggage handling. Told that they could check our bags starting at 12.45 so we got in line at that time. Got to the counter at 12.50 but was told they were still checking late bags from the previous flight and asked to stand to the side of the line until those were done. As we stood there waiting they started letting people from our flight on. We approached the baggage lady and were told we had to go back and stand in line again (which was now a huge line up). A few hours later we found ourselves waiting for the 'priority' boarding service. They called this so we went to the line and found about 60 people ahead of us. We assumed they were all flying elite but 30 seconds after the announcement for priority boarding they started boarding everyone else. The wife and I went to the desk and asked if we were still getting boarded first. The woman working at the desk said we were and said to give our ticket to the woman checking boarding passes who just stood there and intentionally ignored us while continuing to check other peoples passes. This went on for about 5 or 6 passengers until I asked her if she was going to take our boarding passes which I slid across the desk when her partner asked us to. I picked up the boarding passes and held them directly in her face as I guess she was expecting me to do. Once landed in Cuba our 'Elite' seats were in the middle of the plane (which they off loaded from both front and back) so we ended up being last off the plane. After clearing customs from the back of the line we found our bags just sitting alone in the airport. Landing back in Canada our bags were not brought off first as they were supposed to. The only bright notes was from the Cuban Airport staff. They actually did allow us priority boarding from Cuba. We will likely not ever fly Sunwing again and for sure not waste money on their 'Elite' service.

My husband and I travelled with Sunwing airlines on April 18 2015 to Punta Cana. We upgraded to elite hoping to receive better seating and services than Sunwing promised us but of course we were greatly disappointed with all the above. The airline attendants were very rude and abrupt seats still contain ashtrays and the movie's sound system was all static. We will do everything in our power not to patronize with Sunwing again.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
My husband and I travelled Sunwing through Signature Vacations to Costa Rica. We paid extra for Elite Plus and were given row 15 which we were told had extra leg room. It did have extra leg room. It did not however have the ability for the seats to recline. Almost a 6 hour flight with no movement for the seat was very difficult. I recommend Row 16 if paying for Elite Plus as row 16 has the extra leg room and the seat movement. I believe row 14 does not have reclining seats as well but that would need to be confirmed. We left the gate 50 minutes late but I knew this was possible and brought my own snacks and drinks on board as well as my tablet with books and movies so I was able to entertain myself for the trip. The on-board movies were played from drop down units not in seat. The weight limits were difficult especially for the carry on item. The airline did check the weights for some people who looked like they were carrying too much. I do believe that I would try to fly using another airline first and I guess the size of the price difference would make the decision for me.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
10 day package deal from Vancouver to Maya Riveria. This is the worst airline we've travelled - we are seasoned travelers. Purchased Elite Plus both ways. Incoming trip - advised our carry-ons were overweight. They were only allow 5kg? That's the weight of the carry-on empty practically. No special quirks for the Elite extra fees except the leg room. It's a cattle train. No personal entertainment. In fact the small little screen which pops down halfway through your trip only has static for the sound. They don't care. They keep in playing anyway with no one watching. This happened on both in and on going. When you reach Cancun be prepared to unboard then stand on tarmac waiting for them to load you in a bus to the terminal. In the heat. Be prepared to be packed in like pigs going to the slaughter with no air except exhaust fumes. Expect the same for the return trip. We were one hr late on our return trip getting us into Vancouver at 1 am. The plane was freezing on the return. The only solution was buying a $15 disposable blanket! When I suggested we paid for elite the steward said no blanket but how about a big glass of their cheap swill wine. Only way I'd load up in one of these cattle runs is if we were to be evacuated for a hurricane.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
All in all had a great trip to Punta Cana. Travelled from Newfoundland via Gander/Deer Lake. Sunwing almost had the deal sealed as a repeat customer. Check in from Deer Lake was terrific. Staff were excellent. Flight down and crew were also great. The Sunwing check in experience to come home left us feeling robbed and disgruntled. At some point Sunwing needs to incorporate 'Discretion' in to their operations. At the end of the experience getting off the plane back home I was left with the 'lasting' feeling that everything was a mere money grab for Sunwing when I had supposedly already paid for a 'Premium Options' package when I purchased my package. They are the masters at smoke and mirrors when I compare Sunwing to other tour operators I have used to travel to the Dominican Republic from Atlantic Canada in the past. Neither my wife nor I will rely on Sunwing to do that again if it is within our power to determine so. Ironically I don't really think that Sunwing even cares.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
My husband and I returned from Las Vegas on flight #054 arriving in to Toronto at 1.58 am on April 27/15. We purchased Elite Plus so that our seat was larger and the luggage restrictions were more forgiving. The service by the flight attendants on this flight started out ok. We received a hot hand wipe and a drink of pop with our sandwich. That was the end of the service. We were never offered any further beverages of any kind particularly water for the duration of the flight. No chocolates at the end either. the water part is the issue. yes we could have buzzed for water but the beverage service was only offered the one time. We were never offered any wine or beer either. Was it the end of the day and everyone was tired and had run out of supplies? Not impressed.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
I was travelling from Toronto to Punta Cana for 1 week for vacation the flight down to Punta Cana was great it left on time no problems at the airport and good service. But on the way back our flight was originally supposed to take off at 11.25 am we went down to the lobby for 7.30 am for our transfer to the airport we waited for about half an hour then we received a phone call saying that our flight had been delayed a couple of hours. We waited again then we were informed that it had been delayed again for another couple of hours. We again waited and then a Sunwing representative told us that the flight had been delayed until the next day - 4.00 am the next day. They then transferred us to a different resort where it took about 3 hours to get our rooms. Then later that day we had found out that it is being delayed again for a 5.15 am flight. I have flown with Sunwing once before and there was no issue but this was very annoying having my flight home be delayed 4 times.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
Mar 26 to Apr 9 2015. This was our first time using Sunwing and it was their first year offering direct flights from Moncton N.B. to Orlando Florida. Our trip to Orlando went without a hitch. Staff were extremely friendly and service was good. Inflight entertainment wasn't anything to brag about but I had come prepared and had my own music and magazine therefore I would not factor that into the equation whatsoever. Except for the aborted landing on the first try the flight was very enjoyable. Our return trip was like it was with a totally different airline. Firstly we were disappointed in the way they handled and failed to inform us of the delay in processing and checking us in. We were standing in line for at least one hour without the line moving at all. We finally heard from someone in the lineup that he heard that their computer system was down. It would only have taken 1 employee to speak up nice and loud telling us that their system was down instead of letting us stand in line like that. Needless to say that made us late in getting checked in. We were finally onboard and ready for take off when the captain came on the line informing us that there was a light on that he needed to go back to the station and turn it off and that it would only take a few short minutes. Approximately 1/2 hour later he comes back on informing us that they needed the services of a mechanic and that once the mechanic arrived it wouldn't take long to fix but that it could take a while for the mechanic to arrive at the airport to fix it. We are now over 1.5 hours late for our return flight. Nothing was offered to compensate the passengers for this delay. We were all starved by then. Once we arrived in Moncton we were unable to disembark because there was another plane boarding then we were unable to disembark because another plane had arrived and they were going through customs so we spent another hour just sitting there. So what should have been a 3 hour 15 minute stay in the plane ended up being almost six hours. Not good. I would still recommend Sunwing if only for the fact that this was their first year offering the service direct from Moncton to Orlando but from reading all of the other reviews just remember it is buyer beware.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
My family and I along with 184 other passenger were all in the understanding that our Sunwing direct return flight was a direct flight from Punta Cana to Edmonton. However Sunwing purpose held back this information from everyone's itinerary on the whole flight. Why stop in Hamilton? 1) More effective us of their flight crew (same flight crew can not do Edmonton to Punta Cana return) 2) Air cargo from Dominican very lucrative for the carrier 3) Southern Ontario to Edmonton cargo market lucrative for Sunwing. This stop added 2.5 hours onto our flight time and not one passenger de-planed not had prior knowledge of the stop over. Nothing but a cash grab at passengers expense an insult to our intellect! Never again!

Ottawa to Punta Cana April 4 flight 448. Punta Cana to Ottawa April 11 flight 449. I have flown several times in the past and I did like everybody else went to a travel agent. I assumed that everything would be organized for us but it wasn't. The seats are so tight together we couldn't move we were not allowed to go to the bathroom because of turbulence which I understand but when you have to go you have to go. We were never at any point in time told that we would have to drop off other vacationers to other resorts. We were told there was a 90 mins bus ride to the resort. It took us 3 hours on the bus because of drop offs. We were given a piece of paper that indicated we needed to check out at 5 am to be picked up at 6 am (wasted 45 mins waiting) to be brought to the airport and be 1 hour too early at the airport. The flight wasn't even on the board yet. After getting our seats eventually and we were not allowed to choose the seats we wanted we had to wait another 2.5 hours. There was a 25 min delay taking off in Punta Cana. No explanation why yet when we landed we were told not to be late because they don't wait for anybody but somehow we had to wait for someone! There was 3 bathrooms on the plane but one of them was in the galley so not very convenient because we were told not to block the path for the stewardess understandably and the looks we got when we would go to the bathroom yikes! One of the questions on here asked if I flew Premium or economy? We were never offered premium plus there is no way there is room on the plane to have Premium? I will travel again but I will be wiser the next time and I will ask a ton of questions until I am reassured that everything will go smoothly.

Trip to Fort Lauderdale and back to Toronto on April 12 and 19th. Boarding was disorganized. We were called to board and then made to wait in line before boarding this happened in both Toronto and Fort Lauderdale. Our luggage was off loaded in Fort Lauderdale but nobody announced which of the 13 carousels it was coming down at and the signage at Fort Lauderdale doesn't indicate it for Sunwing. The Fort Lauderdale check-in happens at the west side of terminal 4 the plane is loaded from the east side of terminal 3. Yes a different terminal and the opposite side too. It's a bit of a walk but doable if you don't have much carry on. In Toronto the plane touched down early but nobody was available to guide us to the gate only a 10 minute wait to get to the gate and another 5 or so for the door to be opened. Luggage came out an hour later. Staff near the luggage carousel were unable to find out what the delay was or do anything other than apologize once the luggage did start to come out. Meals - On the way down I had a breakfast muffin. It was warm on one half cold on the other. Soggy pizza about the size of a cheque book on the way back. I guess that it costs around $3 per meal they should just pocket that money and drop this lousy food. Charge me $10 extra and give me something well prepared and tasty. I don't see how I would willingly take Sunwing again. Hopefully my future flights will have other choices available.

Recent trip from Calgary (through Saskatoon) - Zihuatanejo MX. 40 minute stop in Saskatoon to pick up passengers became a 90 stop due to double booking of some passengers. Staff were like the keystone cops trying to get things moving. On the way home the flight left 1hr late even though we could all see the plane on the tarmac with no explanation given. Stop-off in Saskatoon to drop off passengers and do a "crew change" became a 2 hour fiasco as the replacement crew were locked out of the closed airport. Different stories were given on what was going on but when the new crew arrived they told the remaining passengers to complain to the Saskatoon Airport Authority for locking up for the night. Surely this was not the first time this route has been taken. Sunwing came across as teh keystone cops. When we complained that our seat was in permanent recline mode and wouldn't stay up for take- off or landing the flight attendant told us not to worry about it and that there were 6 other seats on the plane with similar issues. Never will I fly with them again.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
Flew from Kitchener to Cancun March 16 2015 - no issues with the outbound or return flight. Flights were on time seats were comfortable enough for a brief flight crew friendly. The champagne service is on the flight going to your vacation not on the way back. Very small amount and the food wasn't great. Despite a previous reviewer mentioning that these perks are "free" - they are not. You pay for them in your fare. Still no complaints I didn't expect to receive a full glass of Dom Perignon in a crystal flute! We had serious issues with the resort. I won't go into full detail here but despite our efforts to change resorts we received very little assistance from the Sunwing reps in Cancun and no assistance from calling the 1-800 in Toronto. In short we spent a nightmare week in Cancun and there was nothing we could do about it.

My son and his fiancee planned their destination wedding based on flight schedules. Because at the time Sunwing was offering a direct flight to Los Cabos (under 5 hours from Winnipeg) that is the package they choose. Everything was planned and paid for in January. 3 weeks before departure Sunwing changed the flights. Instead of a direct flight to Cabos we were redirected to Ixtapia. This added an additional 3 hours to our travel. Once in Ixtapia we had to get off the plane retrieve our baggage clear customs and the recheck our baggage. The walk must have been 4 miles in total. Really great when you're elderly and walking is difficult or if you're a young family that's has to carry babies and try and manage toddlers and luggage at the same time. Half a day of our vacation wasted! Return flight home was much better. Got on the plane in Cabos flew 2 hours to Ixtapia waited on a hot plane for 1 1/2 hours then flew another 5 hours to Wpg. Another half day of vacation wasted. Will never ever book with Sunwing again.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
Just arrived back from a trip to Mexico. 1 hour late leaving Toronto no explanation given as to why. We were up early at the resort as we had a 12 noon check out deadline. We were taken to the airport at 5pm for a 7pm flight. We were supposed to arrive back in Toronto at 1.58 am. However we didn't arrive in Toronto until 6.10 am. Delayed for over 4 hours. In reality we were up for close to 24 hours. Reason for the delay the flight leaving Cuba for Toronto was delayed. In this day and age this should not happen. This airline could care less about how we felt. Do yourself a big favor fly with somebody else.

We flew from Ottawa to St. Martin on March 16 and returned on March 23. Everything went smoothly and I have no complaints. We arrived at the airport 3 hours before the flight to check in (both ways) and experienced no line- ups. We paid for Elite Plus and sat in the exit rows which was probably worth the extra $50/person each way as we had lots of leg room and were first served in flight. Our flights were fine and while I didn't "love" the 2 hour stop in Punta Cana on the return trip we still arrived back in Ottawa on time. The in-flight entertainment wasn't great but we expected that so brought our own entertainment (books and music). Food was fine for airplane food and it's included in the price along with wine with supper. For the amount we paid for this trip I feel we got excellent service! I will definitely fly Sunwing again!

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
Flew to Los Cabos March 19 on Sunwing - worse flight my wife and I have experienced. First the flight was 3 hours late leaving Toronto - no one could offer an explanation. Poor food flight attendants seemed to be hiding behind the curtain most of the flight seats worn and very uncomfortable. Flight home March 26 was supposed to leave at 4.20 pm - got to the airport and flight not on the board when later flights with other airlines were - a number of passengers inquired and were told we could be boarding within 20 minutes or possibly 3 hours? When flight was posted it showed a delay of 2 hours - settled in playing cards and having lunch when we heard an announcement the flight was boarding at the other end of the terminal - we left our food and dashed to the other end telling other passengers we recognized the flight was leaving - this could have been a issue with the Cabo airport but Sunwing showed no concern. The only reason the flight back to TO was tolerable was my wife and I had an empty seat between us - lots more room. I'd rather pay a little more and have a more accommodating airline.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
Good value good inflight service but Sunwing dropped the ball badly on our recent return flight from Cancun to Ottawa (Mar 26). First the pick up from our resort to the airport was far too early (5.50 am pick up for a 10.40 am scheduled departure). On arrival at Cancun airport none of the Sunwing reps there could say which counter we should go to for check-in. We wound up standing in an uncertain line for more than an hour before Sunwing staff finally showed up to begin the check-in process. It makes no sense to transport passengers to the airport more than an hour before Sunwing staff will begin the check-in process. Second and more disappointing was the way they handled and failed to keep passengers informed about the departure delay back to Ottawa. We later learned that a flight attendant had suffered a medical emergency on the flight into Cancun that would prevent them from working our flight back to Ottawa. Obviously Sunwing isn't responsible for something like this which is totally out of their control. However it took Sunwing more than an hour to relay this information to passengers. Instead they simply provided rolling notifications of boarding time delays at times posting new departure times that were already outdated when they were posted. When they notified passengers to come to the gate to receive news of the flight status they failed to give the Sunwing rep a microphone-so very few passengers could actually hear news about the medical status of the flight attendant or that Sunwing was looking for 20 "volunteers" to relinquish their seats on our flight to take a connecting flight through Toronto or what the details of the Toronto connecting flight were. Ultimately the situation was resolved when another Sunwing attendant agreed to step in for their unwell colleague and everyone was able to fly direct to Ottawa - albeit 1.5 hours late. Sunwing must do a better job of keeping its passengers informed and in communicating with them.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
Overall a horrible experience. Booked a vacation to Cancun through this company. I can understand delays due to weather and safety. My wife and I both seated in different sections for both directions of our trip. We requested seats together but this seems to be too complicated of a task for this company. Found that there were many other couples and families that this happened to as well. Seats extremely cramped on plane. Mine was broken did not recline. Also when we arrived in Cancun and boarded our bus for our transfer to resort we waited for approx 70 mins after getting on bus to leave airport. We landed at 1.30 pm and were told it was approx 45 mins to our resort. Problem was that this bus carried many other Sunwing customers going to other resorts and the bus was to stop at each one. Ours was the last. We did not arrive to our resort until 6.30 pm! Approx 4 hours later! Will never use Sunwing again.

Flew from Edmonton to Veradero on Feb 14 stayed at Paridisus Princesa Del Mar Resort and returned to Edmonton 7 days later. If you did not sit in rows 1 to 8 or 15 to 21 you did not get a choice of food item. The item left was left over for a reason absolutely disgusting greasy pastry (pizza type) item for both breakfast and dinner. Cabin crew were poor on flight to Veradero. Sat on bus in Veradero for almost an hour waiting for Sunwing reps to try and find 4 people that had likely taken a taxi to their resort and could not be bothered to let the Sunwing reps know. Return trip cabin crew were nicer food was still disgusting. Most of the flights luggage was left in Veradero due to "the plane being too heavy". Our baggage was flown to Vancouver trucked to Edmonton and then sent by bus requiring us to drive to nearest bus depot and retrieve. We received our luggage 8 days after getting home (I guess we should be thankful we received it at all). Will likely not book a Sunwing Vacation ever again and not sure Cuba is on our future travel list either.

We just flew Toronto to Ixtapa. I booked through a travel agent and there was no mention about a 5kg carry-on weight limit - so we were very disappointed and frustrated to have to check 2 of our 4 small carry on bags. Flight was on time both ways - good job food was horrific. Champagne was awful - they shouldn't call it that (it's a tacky gimmick). One movie over four hours on the way there - no movie on the way back because the system was down and basic indifference for the lost 2 hours of entertainment. Flight staff were average - none were particularly friendly. Drink service was limited - felt like we should have had the cart come around at least one more time - I was totally parched when we got there. Staff at check-in in Ixtapa were the best part of the experience - too bad they weren't all as good. At over $800 a ticket I certainly don't think it was particularly good value - that is certainly one of the most expensive tickets I've purchased - and it came with the worst amenities. I'd fly Sunwing again but only as a last resort.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
Sunwing is awful. The champagne service is a joke. The ads show a champagne glass filled with champagne and they even say "Bon voyage glass of sparkling wine" meanwhile it is about an ounce of sparkling wine in a plastic cup you would expect salad dressing to be served in. I mean can't they even use the plastic wine cups? So misleading. Furthermore the "hotel towel service" is nothing more than a small wet napkin that has been warmed up. The seats were terribly uncomfortable and small. My last flight the air regulator was broken and it was stifling on the flight. I will never willingly fly Sunwing again! Also no TVs on the back of seats so bring your glasses if you get stuck in a row that is far from the nearest TV. The food was awful.

Just got back Toronto from a trip from to Cuba. Friends of ours had to wait over an hour for Sunwing to get their daughter a wheelchair to get through customs. They were then rushed to get on the flight "first" where they were put on the plain but their daughter had to stay outside on the tarmac until every other passenger got on. At Toronto they again did not have a wheelchair ready and were last off. The food was terrible. Apparently a cheese croissant is considered pizza? There was no inflight movie. The flight attendants seemed lost whenever they attempted to make an announcement. At times we had no idea what they were trying to say.

Took Sunwing to MBJ Jamaica Jan 26/15 and return Feb 09/15 YEG Canada. These were the worst flight experiences I've had in 35 yrs of aviation employment and extensive airline holiday required flying. They allowed a drunk to upset the flight down with loud disruptive and aggressive behaviour. The FA helped by supplying doubles to him throughout the flight. Our return trip included a very poorly padded seat with fold out of the arm table trays which made it very cramped and uncomfortable a screaming child right behind us that FA did nothing to help calm down. A diversion to YWG for fuel because of head winds. The pilot did inform us ahead that this might occur! No Enforcement of no cellphone use as we were being refuelled with passengers onboard.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
Future first preference would not be Sunwings Airlines. Our departure to Cancun on Feb 22 was 1.5 hrs late - announcement was made informing us the pilot had called in sick and head office in Toronto had mistakenly not replaced him!! No compensation for this delay was provided. Planes felt quite old seating space really small and lacking cushioning no space in seat back to put your things pop-down TV's outdated static sound and food was of poor quality. The small amt of champagne (on the way over only) the warm 'hot' towel and chocolate mint were not enough to impress. Attendants on the return flight were much friendlier and out servicing more. Sunwings/Nexus rep.s at the resort seemed to be always available friendly and helpful.

Ottawa to Cancun Feb 9-16/15. Delayed coming back for 4 hrs with no explanation. Very old airplane with some sort of Russian language everywhere. Seats were so worn that there was no foam to sit on. Extremely cramped and uncomfortable. Had same experience Dec/14. We will never fly them again - even it was free!

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
We flew to Punta Cana recently and I wanted to add my review regarding the service and overall experience with Sunwing. Their planes are old and purchased from other airlines. The leg room is non existent! Their on time departure is never "on time". The flight attendants are hit and miss but mostly miss. As I'm sure they deal with frustrated vacationer all the time. Check in staff have very poor customer service. If you can avoid flying or booking a trip with them I would highly recommend it!

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
Traveled from Regina SK. to Puerto Vallarta on Feb 22nd. I was a little worried after reading all the negative reviews but I thought that Sunwing was great. The flight crews on both our flights were very nice and provided good service. Granted the food onboard wasn't great but what do you want for airline food. We booked the Elite Plus and I am happy that we did. The extra leg room was a huge bonus. We also avoided the long lineup at the airport coming home. The only things that I didn't like were that the transfer bus from the airport didn't have a list of names of people that should be on the bus. I have no idea how they knew when they had everyone of if someone was missing. I also didn't like that you had to see the Sunwing reps the morning after arriving to book the shuttle back to the airport. We ended up waiting quite awhile to see a rep as people were booking excursions. If hotel transfers are included in the package price you shouldn't be required to talk with a rep.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
Flew last week Calgary to Punta Cana. They have crammed more seats into their small 737. You hardly have room to breathe. They don't tell you this but apparently now they cannot go direct from there to anywhere in the west. We learned on plane that they had to go to Hamilton for fuel. We were on that for almost 9 hrs getting into Calgary 1.5 hrs late cramped up in the plane. The crew got to change in Hamilton. There were flights to Edmonton and Vancouver and they too had to go to Hamilton. Airline should either stop flying these long routes or get planes that can go that distance. Never again.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
Don't know where all the negativity comes from. Booked an all inclusive through Sunwing to the Bel Air resort in Nuevo Vallarta from February 27 to March 6. Flight left Vancouver at 6 am to Puerto Vallarta. Flight was right on time. Great friendly cabin crew. Captain came on several times during the flight to update our arrival time weather in Puerto Vallarta etc. The seats aren't that comfortable but find me one on any other airline in economy class and I'll give you an award! Nice smooth flight served champagne (yes it was a small amount but who cares..it was free! Breakfast was a muffin with sausage egg cheese and was as good as any I've had in the fast food retaurants (again..absolutely free). We were given shortbread cookies which were delicious and free. Chocolates..free. Free coffee soft drinks water etc. entertainment is overhead TV but so what? Bring a book. Flight landed 25 minutes early. Luggage was there before we were. Transfers arranged through Sunwing were on time and Fun and free. Flight coming back left a few minutes early. Again super attentive cabin crew and announcements from the pilot. Lunch was a smoked meat sandwich or a pizza. Not gourmet but good enough. If you want something of better value then buy it at the airport. Don't know how you can complain about something that is free. Same cookies chocolates and free wine with lunch. We were also given a second cabin service of a snack and free bevies. Flight landed early and again our luggage was there before we were. Great experience all around. In fact I felt it was better than the many flights I've taken on supposed first class airlines.

Just back from trip to Santa Clara. Both outbound and return flights were on time. The aircrew was very friendly and the food offered was fine. We did buy the extra legroom seats (exit row). The regular seats looked quite tight.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
Very disappointed. Flew with Sunwing on February 21 2015 checked in on time and we were told to go and wait in lounge area with other travellers our flight was 8.45 am and we were called at 8.35 to go through customs - it was crazy. Later found out they were not suppose to do that. On top of that our flight was delay 2.5 hrs we had to get to Miami for a cruise leaving at 4 got to Miami and it took forever to get our luggage but luckily for Carnival they were very patient and got us to ship. We boarded the ship at 4 pm. Flew back with Sunwing on Mar 1 was delayed again - not surprising. Staff had no idea what they were doing. Don't think I would fly with them again. You would think they would get it right by now with all the negative reviews.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
I want to thank Sunwing for "making the most" out of a terrible "blizzard" that postponed my holiday to Cancun for 2 days. We were to leave Saint John (Feb 15 at 7.30 am). Due to a catering issue and then the blizzard hitting the East Coast we did not fly out until early Tuesday morning (at 3.30 am arriving in Cancun at 8.00 am). I lost 2 days. But once aboard the crew had "unlimited" drinks all the way to Cancun and were Wonderful. The airline refunded my first day lost and the second day they provided a $150 voucher for our next trip. They arranged hotels and cabs gave vouchers for lunch and dinner on the Sunday and on the Monday returned us to our hotels with a $45. lunch voucher. So yes my 14 day vacation turned into 12 days. I would definitely recommend.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
Departure was 1.5 hrs late - it was announced that the pilot had called in sick and head office in Toronto mistakenly did not replace him! Nothing was offered to passengers to compensate for the delay. The plane felt older with outdated overhead viewing screens static sound seating space is small and uncomfortable no place in seat back to tuck your things and food was of poor quality. The 'extras' - wee bit of champagne (only on the way over) warm/hot towel and chocolate mint - were not enough to impress. Staff on the return flight were out more and much friendlier than on the way over. Sunwing (Nexus) reps. were at the airport to assist although there was initially some confusion and they were available friendly and helpful at the resort.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
Flew from Ottawa to Punta Cana on March 7 2015. Experienced a one hour delay due to an air conditioning problem. All in all it was a pleasant flight with a hot breakfast sandwich served. Had lots of legroom but I paid for that.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
Flew non stop Toronto to Puerto Plata 22 Feb 15 WG411 - plane was old and seats very small - big people better book Elite Plus to be comfortable. I am average sized and it was cramped movie didn't work - flight was on time and service was fine. Champagne is a thing Sunwing does doesn't matter if it is there or not to me. WG410 on way back 1 Mar 15 - plane was quite new and seat room was much better - food typical plane food both down and back. Flight on time plane clean. I was satisfied with the service both ways. This is the second time I have booked with Sunwing - once to Cuba and this time to Puerto Plata - no problems either time.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
Very disappointed. Flew Ottawa to Cancun WG 553. Paid extra for Elite Plus - seats are not wider nor is there extra leg room. We were seated in Row 1 next to a single bathroom and galley with people lining up for the bathroom. We had passengers banging into our legs and chairs as they made room for the flight attendants to go by. Do not bother to pay extra for Elite Plus seats. Our flight was scheduled to leave at 5pm it was delayed and did not take off until 9pm. Sunwing Staff did not bother to apologize once for the delay to all the waiting passengers nor bothered to provide an explanation for the delay. Unacceptable. We arrived in Cancun at 1.30am and waited for our luggage for 1 hour! Again no apology or explanation from Sunwing Staff. We arrived at our hotel at 3.30am when we were supposed to be there at 9.30pm. Our family was exhausted and the following day was spent recovering and catching up on sleep and as a result we lost a day. The crew were unprofessional and rude. Cancun-Ottawa WG554 our plane was delayed for 1.5 hours and again passengers did not receive an apology or an explanation for the delay. We will never fly Sunwing Airlines and we will gladly pay extra for other airlines that understand and deliver good customer service!

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
Never again! We were supposed to be home at 8pm on Feb 18 from Mexico we got home at 3am Feb 19. There was not enough food water was rarely offered. We were supposed to be direct home to Edmonton but were diverted to Winnipeg! We travel quite a bit and always go away in the winter but I would not recommend this airline.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
Very disappointed in Sunwing! Outbound I wasn't able to check in online so at the airport early. Was given row 28 at rear of plane. The flight magazine was so soiled the attendant didn't like touching it. There was wads of gum stuck in the window. When food finally arrived they ran out on row 27 with only one choice for us in row 28. Leaving Mexico the Sunwing rude personal wouldn't let us carry on our luggage which was underweight and that we had carried on in Vancouver. She then gave us row 32 even thought we were 3 hours early at the terminal. She also insisted it was a direct flight to Vancouver. At 6pm we left Los Cabos and flew 55 minutes south to Puerto Vallarta sat on the ground for 50 minutes before a 4.5 hour flight to Vancouver. This was not a direct flight and not only in a non reclining chair but no food until after 9pm. Seven hours to get home from Mexico! Never again with Sunwing.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
On February 19 2015 we flew to Santa Clara Cuba. Flight No: WG301. Returned flight was on February 26 flight No: WG301. On the way to Cuba we were served a meal accompanied with champagne. Nice touch. But on the way back they demanded $3.00 for a small bottle of water. I was in complete shock and asked a stewardess if we really are required to pay for the water. She confirmed that. Some time later juice and sandwiches were offered free of charge. That $3.00 bottle of water cancelled all the other pleasantries like champagne. I would be very hard pressed to fly with Sunwing again.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
After booking and paying for a direct flight from Vancouver B.C. to Los Cabos we were flown to Puerto Vallarta made to disembark pick up our luggage go through customs recheck our luggage and get back on the same plane! Then flown back to Los Cabos. The flight back home was similar. Lost 2 full days to travelling for a 4.5 hour original flight! Will never fly or recommend this airline again. Everyone on this flight was very angry.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
Flight WG063 from St. Petersburg Florida to Toronto on February 23. I arrived 2 hours before the departure time and I had purchased Elite pkg. There was no Elite service and the line up was extremely long. It took over an hour and a half to get to the counter to receive my boarding pass. It seemed very disorganized. Then the passengers were rushed through the security section ducking under the line barriers as the flight was being called. I have flown many times with Sunwing and I must say I was very disappointed with the service on this flight.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
This airline's service has diminished significantly over several years. Their fleet is old and small so when they have mechanical issues as old planes are prone to do they don't have the fleet capacity to replace those planes to avoid delays. Our most recent trip to Mexico was delayed 2.5 hours on the way in and 6 hours on the way back due to - surprise - mechanical problems. Their fleet is ancient the plane on the way back had ashtrays in the chair armrests. During the delay we had no communication the reps on the resort notified no one about the delay with the result that the guests scheduled to leave that day were packed and ready to go when they were told they would have to stick around in the lobby for another 6 hours to wait for their airport bus which turned into an even longer wait at the airport. Sunwing then changed gates at the airport twice without informing the waiting passengers. It was a fiasco. Funny thing is we had paid over $100 extra per adult to return on the earlier flight (there was a cheaper option for a later flight). Sunwing took our money but then only provided the cheaper later option for flying out anyway. No refunds were ever issued.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
Travelled from Ottawa to Cuba in February 2015. Meals were terrible. Seats so close together you could barely move. No champagne on return flight. No hot beverages. Flight delayed leaving then took 5 hours to get to Cuba but only 3.5 hours return. Ended up in Cuba with no money and I mean no money because our cards were not acceptable. Only enough cash to pay tax to depart. Sunwing Reps could do nothing to help us. Poor service to say the least.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
Flew from Toronto to Varadaro Cuba on February 12 2015. Our 0700 hrs. departure was delayed until 1530 hrs due to a mechanical issue on the beat up old 727 they had. Lost an entire day of our vacation. Flight back to Toronto on 19 February was on time but it took two hours to get our baggage off of the plane. We paid an additional $60. on the return flight for upgraded elite plus seating and priority baggage. Our seat was fine but our baggage arrived with everyone else's two hours after landing. The flight crews were great the overall experience - terrible!

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
We chartered for a 2 week all-inclusive trip to Cuba in February of 2015. The seats were very very close together and the aisle was so narrow that the refreshment cart could just get by. One could not get past the cart unless you stood in someone's space until the cart went by. On the return flight the elderly guy behind me kept bumping the back of my seat probably with his knees and hopefully unintentionally thus waking me up whenever I dozed off. Our "dinner" comprised of one piece of 2x4 piece of "pizza". They only have one drop down TV screen for 3 rows of seats and no choice of movies. The red-eye flight was brutal. Leave YVR at 7 pm arrive Cuba at 12.30 5.30 am Cuba time. The return is worse. Leave Cuba at 6 am and after a 7 hour flight arrive YVR at 10 am BC time. On a positive note the stewardess was very efficient and calm when the lady in front of us got sick and passed out. Would I travel with Sunwing again? No.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
We traveled with Sunwing Feb 12 and 19. We flew from Montreal to Cayo Coco Cuba and have nothing but praise for this airline. The check-in staff in Montreal were friendly. The flight attendants were pleasant and helpful. The inflight meal was nothing fancy but edible and hot. On our way home I was not feeling well and they went out of their way to make sure I was comfortable. Despite a snowstorm leaving Montreal we were on time arriving and the plane looked fairly new. Overall a great experience! I traveled economy class and no problems with seat selection.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
So disappointed in our recent trip with Sunwing. We booked a direct non-stop flight from Edmonton to Huatulco in October. In January we received confirmation of the trip. Three days later we were notified that we would now be traveling via Winnipeg on both legs of the trip. No explanation why. Just told that it's within Sunwing's legal rights to make changes. This added an extra 3 hours to each leg of our trip. On top of that the plane was old food scarce and not tasty ground staff dismissive and no in-flight entertainment to speak of. So disappointing as the resort we were at was fantastic.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
Just returned home from St Maarten. My wife and I flew Sunwing for our first time. Everything was fine until we arrived back in Toronto on Sunday night. We sat on the tarmac for half an hour because no gates were available. Once we finally got off the plane and made our way down to baggage we sat there for two and half hours before they told us that the luggage was not going to be unloaded off the plane due to the cold temperature. The place went crazy and no one with any authority from Sunwing was present to provide proper details to a very tired group of passengers. 4 days later we finally received our luggage.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
We booked an all inclusive wedding pkg over a year in advance being assured of the best price and non stop flight from Edmonton to Huatulco. We got neither. Our flight ended up going to Winnipeg both coming and going and others in the wedding party on the same flight got a much better price. Unfortunately other things happened that I am unable to talk about. I have traveled many times before and this was by far my worst experience.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
We went from Toronto to Cancun and then back to Toronto. The flight was great no turbulence and we had purchased the elite seating and the extra leg room was great. The lunches served were tasty and the staff very friendly. The only complaint were the movies both going and coming thank heavens I had a good book to read. Then again I was not on flight for the entertainment. We will definitely fly with them again.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
We have traveled twice in the last two months on this airline and found the service to be extremely slow the food awful. On our last trip we were in the air for over 6 hrs and I turned on my overhead light for service (another drink) only had one to that point as that was all that offered up till then. To be told we would be landing in 1 hr and I could wait till then and could my drinks for free at the resort. Very rude comment and also we were only landing to drop off people at Punta Cana and still had approx. another 3 hrs of air time. All four trips (2 to point of destination and 2 return) they had run out of tomato juice before they had got to our row 11. The movies were bad and then to have to watch 3 same re-runs of a sitcom after - that's bad. Both trips we thought were direct flights and only found out after we paid that there were stoppages on all. Not to mention delays at airports or on runway. Always was something going wrong!

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
We booked a direct flight to Huatulco from Edmonton for early February 2015. Two weeks before our flight we were notified that our direct flight was now a connection to Winnipeg and would mean leaving two hours earlier and arriving two hours later than originally planned. Since we had not purchased the cancellation insurance - or as we now call it the Sunwing messes you over insurance" - we had no options but to spend 9 hours each day travelling that reduced our 7 day vacation down to 5 days. What was worse about all of this was that when we picked up people in Winnipeg - it was approximately 30% of the plane. So they choice to connect in Winnipeg and inconvenience 70% of their passengers rather than connecting in Edmonton and inconveniencing 30% of their passengers. This was not our first travel experience with Sunwing but I can assure you - it will be our last.

Feb 15 2015 flight 619 from Cuba. Delayed 8.5 hours on direct flight to Saskatoon had to redirect to Toronto to fuel up as we were too heavy. Had to sit in the plane for 2.5 hours in Toronto as well. Sunwing service on flight was rude and lack of food for such a delay. 188 people on board this flight. Were to land in Saskatoon at 8am Sunday morning finally made it to Saskatoon at 6pm Sunday night. We will never fly Sunwing again nor recommend to anyone we know. Very unprofessional chaotic unorganized rude lack of communication. All around a terrible experience. Were told we could not recline seats and made for a very uncomfortable flight both ways.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
This airline has a reputation for being terribly late. Our flight to Cancun was delayed 8 hours which resulted in a full day loss on our trip. They would tell us every hour "the plane will be here in an hour" but that went on for 8 hours. Our 6am flight turned into a 3pm flight which means they served us old breakfast sandwiches on the plane. The return flight was also delayed. We were picked up at our resort at 6:50pm and our plane finally departed at 3.30am. The flight attendants handed out $75 coupons to everyone for the delays but they ran out of copies for the last row of the plane (where I sat). This was January 5th. Still haven't received my coupon.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
We travelled from Kelowna to Ixtapa for a one-week all-inclusive this past month (January 2015). We were promised a direct non-stop flight and that's what we got. Our flights were not only on time but a bit early both down and back and the service onboard was above average. We received a little bit of champagne both there and back (yes a small amount but that's okay) and complimentary wine with our meal on the way back. The price was right Sunwings delivered what it promised and we already have another trip lined up with Sunwings. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in Ixtapa and were are very happy with Sunwings.

Currently sitting on tarmac for flight WG571. Not impressed with the lack of communication and services with this flight. Was boarded at 3.30 when flight was scheduled to depart at 3. Was further told that luggage was delayed being boarded on plane when actuality was the previous flight luggage had not even been removed. No working sink in the bathroom. Hopefully return trip from San Jose Del Cabo will be better.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
I will never fly Sunwing again. Currently I am sitting on a plane on the Tarmac in Toronto. I have been here 2 hours (it was supposed to be at most a 60 min stop for fuel). I was supposed to fly home to Saskatoon direct from Cuba but apparently due to wind that was not possible. This of course after I am awake all night waiting for a delayed plane. Sunwing is terrible at communicating delays with their customers. We were unable to obtain info in Cuba as to what was going on the customer care center was not answering. Finally a fellow traveller called Saskatoon to find out what was going on. It was then we learned we would be re-routed - something Sunwing kept denying once we got to the airport in Cuba. I can understand delays related to weather but a delay related to an airlines greed and tight schedule is totally inappropriate. Also inappropriate is the airlines failure to communicate with their customers.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
Flight 238 from Toronto to Cayo Coco was very good. Service was excellent delicious lunch hot turkey sandwich or pizza with glass of red or white wine or pop and cookies. Flight attendants were very friendly and helpful. On the return flight 239 we had medical emergency which was handled very professionally. Overall very satisfactory trip.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
The food was terrible and they ran out I mean everyone expects nasty food on an airplane but it was barely edible. The "veggie pizza" was greasy dough with about a teaspoon of pasta sauce. They ran out of the other option long before they got to my family and since we didn't get an option (not that we complained) our flight attendant offered us each a full can of soda instead of a glassful. The people in the 2 rows at the very back didn't get anything - they were offered 2 desserts and one of the flight attendants actually offered part of his own bagged lunch to them! I would pay more for my flight just to get a nutritious filling meal. It seems like they actually go out of their way to find the most unappetizing cheap food possible. They also showed current movies good for viewers of any age and gave a free set of headphones on the way to our destination (you must keep them for the return flight). The flight attendants were all very nice and did there job (plus more as stated above) no baggage was lost and check-in was simple. The Sunwing reps in Ixtapa Mexico were very nice. They also worked certain hours throughout the week for bookings. The flight schedule was posted and kept up to date in the lobby of our hotel so we were aware of any delays (there were none) and of the 1 hour stop in Saskatoon AB before landing in Calgary AB. We ended up arriving in Calgary an hour ahead of schedule! Overall good but the food - really?

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
This airline has a reputation for not being on time as I have now discovered. We were on a flight on December 21 2014 to Punta Cana and the flight was delayed for an hour with no explanation. On the return flight from Punta Cana to Toronto the flight was delayed 3 hours. Once we boarded we were advised by the Pilot that there was a mechanical problem but they would be able to obtain the required information from the ground? We were also advised that the air conditioning was not functioning but once airborne the air condition would be resolved. The Sunwing customer service is non existent and especially if you purchased the package through a Travel Agent their response was that they did not communicate directly with customers and it would be necessary to contact the Travel Agent for assistance. Try contacting anyone at Sunwing not possible! They do provide customer service and avoid any contact with customers as much as possible. Would not book any vacations again with Sunwing.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
Flight 764 Jan 11 2015. Montreal to Sint Maarten. Flight 765 Jan 18 2015. Sint Maarten to Montreal. We found the ground crew to be very courteous and that is where our compliments stop. I have never seen cabin seating so tight and I am only 5 ft tall. The planes are not only cramped but also outdated not having screens behind the seats. On our return voyage which departed Sint Maarten at 6.30 pm we did not see any cabin crew for 2 hours after take off. We could not get water or any beverages until halfway through the trip. I have travelled with Air Canada WestJet Thomas cook and Air Transat and have found those experiences more enjoyable. I will avoid any destination in the future if Sunwing is the carrier. It is most definitely not pleasant feeling like I am being herded like cattle in tight spaces. Surely with the money being saved on cheaper fuel today Sunwing could take out a few rows of seating In order to allow its passengers to be able to shift a little in their seat. On a final note I am happy that I did not pay a premium for Elite as the seats appeared to be at best 2 inches larger.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
The flight was a disappointment for 2 reasons. You see the ads on TV for "champagne flights" where people are given a normal glassful. In reality all we got was a thimbleful in a tiny plastic shot glass - less than one ounce. If they are going to push these champagne flights in every ad it should be as advertised. The other problem is the outdated movie screens and lack of choice in inflight entertainment. Many airlines these days have a screen in the back of every seat and a selection of things to see.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
Purchased a 4 night trip to Nassau flight scheduled to leave Toronto at 6.10pm (WG746) arriving in Nassau at 9.35pm. We were delayed with no explanation for 3 hours. After de-icing we took off around 9.20pm We were in the air for about an hour and a half the Pilot messaged that one of the 2 airplane systems is down and we have to fly back to Toronto. There are plenty of airports in the states to land in but Sunwing decided to fly back to Toronto. We landed back in Toronto at around midnight. I bought a 4 night trip the first night is done by the time we fly back to Nassau it will 4am the earliest. No food or drink were served customers were complaining. I opted not to go to Nassau since we lost so much time and asked to be let off the plane. I emailed Sunwing looking for my money back or hesitantly a replacement trip. Awaiting a response. I would pay the extra money to fly another airline.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
This was our first time using them. We went to Mazatlan Mexico from Jan 16/15 to Jan 23/15. I do not know if we had an exception to the rule but Sunwing was excellent. Great check-in people coming and going great flight staff and great on the ground people at the resort. A few things we did not like were: we used their Elite Plus service which was great to get a emergency exit but man the seats seemed hard. Maybe not used to flying as we only fly a few times a year sorry but Air Canada has a leg up on the seating department. You do get a free meal but it was really bad going down but an above average coming home. They only play one movie for the whole plane out of roof TV's I would rather have a seatback selection like the other airlines. Small thing but when stuck on a plane for 5 hours it's nice to have a selection. Would we use Sunwing again? For sure if going to the west side of Mexico. Planes were on time boarding on time great resort and good price. All in all great holiday provided from Sunwing Vacations.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
If you fly to Cuba chances you will get a direct flight but if like us you are going to Mexico chances you will stop somewhere in Cuba to let some passengers off. Lost a full day of vacation because of travel time. On return they made us wait over an hour for our luggage (yes the airline is responsible for delivery of luggage). Even the Customs Agent waiting for us to show our customs cards was laughing and guessed we were with Sunwing. Never again.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
After reading some of the reviews on here I am starting to think there must be 2 Sunwing Airlines! We have flown Sunwing for years now and have had the pleasure of smooth flights and friendly staff. We have just recently returned from Cuba on time with no issues yet again. I have flown WestJet and Air Canada and was treated like they (the staff) were doing me a favour by letting me be their customer. With Sunwing I think it is really a nice touch that you get a warm towel glass of champagne on departure red or white wine with your meal and a milk chocolate bar upon arrival - all free! Cost you 6 bucks for a 3 day old sandwich on Air Canada! It was only recently that Sunwing stopped giving away headsets. We are indeed satisfied Sunwing passengers.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
We just returned from a 7 day vacation to Los Cabos. What was initially a direct flight turned into a 14 hour nightmare both ways. We left WPG (late) at 10 am Jan 8th and did not arrive at our hotel until midnight. We left the resort at 10 am Jan 15 and did not arrive in WPG until midnight. We paid for Elite Service each way and while we received it on the trip out no one who booked elite seats were assigned them on the return flight. We were encouraged to book excursions in-flight for better pricing which turned out to be a bad idea because we could have received 3 for the price of 2 at the hotel. Had no representation at the airport - everyone was just told to call customer service which we did however to date no one has bothered to return our call. Will definitely look for another airline next time we travel and we take a minimum of 2 each year. Horrible customer service. Someone should at least acknowledge your phone call or email.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
First off let me say I have flown many airlines including charter carriers. Sunwing was by far the worst experience I have had flying. Staff were extremely rude and unhelpful. On our outbound flight Edmonton to Varadero we had a stewardess ask us to move out of the walkway so she could get by-and by asking I mean in a snarly tone 'sir you need to move I need to get past'. I replied back by saying 'give me one moment just getting my bag in the overhead bin' she ended up pushing her way past. Are they not there to assist us in helping the plane take off as scheduled and not be pushy. On our return flight - before even taking off you could here 2 of the attendants fighting with each other that there was not enough food on the flight to feed everyone - that is exactly what you want to hear after spending a week in Cuba! The aircraft's themselves are very small and cramped even if you are shorter. Overall I would be willing to pay more to fly on a competitors flight to avoid traveling with Sunwing. I would not recommend it.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
Booked a supposedly direct flight all Inclusive vacation to Los Cabos Mexico leaving Winnipeg Xmas day returning on New Years day Flight was changed 3 weeks before departure now leaving 3 hours later than originally scheduled the return flight was changed to leaving 3 hours later again but we had to stop at Ixtapa to let people disembark and to embark a nightmare of a flight. We were on the plane for 8 long hours very disappointed as the reason we booked with Sunwing was because of the convenient originally advertised flights. They know exactly what they are doing to maximize profits combining two flights and disrespecting their customers by only changing flights after booking. Never flying Sunwing again as they cannot be trusted.

Our flights to Cuba and back were on time the staff at the desk were very good and the plane crew were excellent. I am Celiac and called the airline office a few weeks before leaving to insure there would be a gluten free meal on board for me and was pleased to see it was taken care of. All in all it was very good.

I booked a trip from Ottawa to Cancun from December 8th to 12th. I was assured that this was a direct flight. 24 hours prior to us leaving I received a phone call from Sunwing informing us that we now have to stop in Cayo-Coco Cuba to offload some passengers. I was very upset with the agent and she informed me that they are allowed to do this as per the fine print on the agreement. We were told that it would only take 30 minutes and it was closer to an hour. The flight back is where this falls apart. We were scheduled to leave Cancun at 8.10pm when we arrived to check in we were informed that the flight will be delayed and that we are now leaving at 10.10pm. We were not informed by any Sunwing rep and the flight kept getting delayed more and more. Finally a Sunwing Rep spoke on the intercom and updated us that we would be leaving at 1.20am. We didn't leave Cancun until 3am. The Flight attendants were the most unprofessional I have met in all my years of travelling. I will never use Sunwing again.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
My wife and I recently travelled with Sunwing to Cancun for a two week vacation. The flights to and from Cancuun consisted of rude staff poor service and horrible food. When we arrived in Cancun it took SunWing 2 hours to arrange our transfer from the airport to our hotel leaving us and a number of other guests who had young children standing on the curb for that time. Our return flight originating in Cancun was a disaster. During check-in the agent informed us that we were over our baggage limit which was not possible as we were returning with the same bags with which we had arrived (no additional weight). When we explained to them at length that we had purchased an extra baggage allowance and showed the receipt they replied we did not that we only had advanced seat selection and early boarding with our additional purchase. This was not the story we got either from the agent when booking or at the Calgary airport agent during check in. They both stated that the package we bought included extra baggage. We ended up having to explain ourselves to the check in agent the manager and another customer service rep but to no avail. We were told the only way we would be able to take our bags home was to pay an additional $100 or to take our bags and leave. We were given two options: either pay for the additional baggage or take our bags and leave. Of course we ended up paying the baggage fee of $100 but we left feeling very disappointed in our choice of booking on SunWing especially when we had other choices for this trip. We had made our decision to book with SunWing based in part on the additional baggage we would be allowed but it is clear that the additional baggage offering is not what it appears to be. We will never book with Sunwing again and advise others to find other vacation providers. We travel frequently and have had some great experiences and some mediocre experiences nothing we couldn't live with. But this experience is by far the worst and was worth taking the time to comment about.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
Travelled to Cuba 30 Dec returned 13 Jan. No movie enroute plus no headsets to listen to on return miscount of babies and were delayed almost an hour while recount was done. The smoked meat was horrible couldn't eat it. I had paid for the Elite plus package and the stewardess wanted $3 for the headset on the return because she had informed that they were not free anymore even after I had questioned it because I was entitled to them with the elite package and what first run movies. To make things worst I paid $200 extra for this package when a passenger sitting next to me had his family of five sitting in the preferred seats at no extra cost to him. If this isn't false advertisement what is.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
Travelled Jan 9 2015 flight WG320 to Santa Clara Cuba. 12 in my group 6 of them children. I cannot say enough good things about Sunwing from the people who checked us in to aircraft crew. We flew economy and compared to many other airlines we've flown were treated wonderfully. One of our group was a nervous flyer captain and crew went out of there way to make her comfortable. Champagne and juice great. Not served on any other airline. Plastic glasses are great. People don't realize that china and glass isn't used on most airlines. Breakfast was served- again it's airline food and it was good. Gourmet dining you'll have to pay a lot more for. Arrived in Cuba on time and had a wonderful vacation. Returned Jan 16 flight WG321. Again we were greeted by efficient friendly attendants. Service on plane was again Wonderful. Flight home was great. I would recommend this airline. The staff from the gate to aircraft are friendly and professional the airplane cabin and toilets were very clean and well stocked.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
Absolutely worst airline service ever. Flight was delayed from 8pm to 3am because of weather and late flights and we were sent to the airport and passed through customs only to be told that the flight was cancelled because the crew needed rest. We then had to pass through all the arrival procedures and security checks. We eventually arrived at another hotel at 4 in the morning and it took 2 hours to check in because there were 180 passengers and 3 clerks. Everyone got to bed at around 6am. The next morning the flight was set to leave at 6 pm but none of the Sunwing representatives had any idea what was going on. After arriving the airport for the second time the flight was constantly delayed by 10 minutes for reasons unknown to everyone. The flight ending up leaving 2 and a half hours later. When we arrived back in Canada everyone thought this nightmare was over until we find out the baggage is locked into the plane because of a frozen door. We ended up having to wait an extra 2 hours for our luggage. Total delay time 26 hours.

We left Vancouver on Dec 31 and everything was fine except for the non working entertainment problem - the service was good and friendly. However on the return flight from Cancun Jan 7 after 3 gate changes we were en-route for Vancouver - tired thirsty and most of our $ spent in the airport- after about 1/2 hour in the air the stewardess came around asking if anyone wanted to buy a bottle of water. Another 1/2 hour or so they came around with a comp glass of water (about 3 mouthfuls) and then they left again behind the curtain - they were fixing our food I guess. They ran out of one selection just after of our seat (10) then they came again - duty free sales. Finally they came and gave another half glass of water or pop. It seemed as though their priority was to sell everything we had already paid for. Why sell water on a flight where they are supposed to include it? The seats are cramped together and its a tight fit for anyone over 180 lbs to even sit in the seat. The seats themselves are probably the least comfortable I have ever flown on - and I have been in a lot of aircraft. If the lack of service that was displayed by these stewardess is any indication of Sunwing then I will never be back.

We booked a return flight from Montreal to Puerto Plata with Sunwing Airlines. Both flights were supposed to be direct flights. I booked the flight because of this reason only. 1 week before the departure we received an e-mail that we would fly to Punta Cana first and then back to Puerto Plata. Flight # WG428. Consequently I phoned Sunwing Airlines and also send an e-mail to their Customer Service pointing out that I paid for a direct flight. The customer service person answering the phone told us in a not very pleasant way that this is what Sunwing can do and it is in their conditions. The e-mail request didn't get answered at all. I pointed out that at time of booking I spoke with the reservation agent and was told it would be a direct flight. Additionally arriving in Punta Cana we had to leave the plane (which we were assured it wouldn't happen) and re-board. Instead of a 5 hour flight we needed 9 hours. If I add up the costs (we had to pay separate for everything) the customer service and the treatment in general this was my last trip with Sunwing. I wouldn't recommend this airline at all.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
Travelled YYC-CUN return. Check in on both flights was quick as we had purchased the premium package. First flight was uneventful although it took far too long to start service. Breakfast was disgusting though. The return flight was marginal. The washrooms ran out of water shortly into the flight. When I asked for another drink I was told quite rudely that meal service was starting in a few minutes so I'd have to wait. 30 minutes later with no sign of any meals I asked again and was told bluntly no I'd have to wait. It would be bad if they were a full service airline to get such an attitude but for one who charges for drinks it's also pretty stupid. Not the biggest deal but wasn't a nice way to end our vacation. Everything else was fine but only just. Unless they have a major sale I won't travel with them again.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
We arrived at the Edmonton Airport 2 hours prior to our flight with Sunwing to go to Cancun. We booked a $5000 package through Sunwing for our trip. The gate agent was outright rude snappy and demanding. Apparently there were only 2 seats left next to each other in front of the emergency exit which do not recline which i found hard to believe. She set the tone for our experience with Sunwing. We arrived at the gate to find the flight delayed by 2.5 hours however she didn't bother mentioning that at check in. No Sunwing staff in sight. Other passengers waiting around complaining that this happens with Sunwing all the time. That lady working the gate the morning of January 5th 2015 should not be in a customer service role. Sure put a bad taste in our mouth when prior to that we were excited to go to Mexico.

I have travelled Sunwing twice (Cancun & Varadero) and have no complaints. Both times there was no delay getting to our location however when we were leaving Cuba out bus transfer was late and our plane was delayed by 1.5hrs. This was not the biggest issue since I love hanging out in airports and was in good company. The seats are not the best but I would say no worse then Air Canada or Westjet. I really enjoyed the hot towel you receive onboard. Food was so-so but we usually grab our own snacks and food before boarding.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
I booked a non-stop flight from PIE to Toronto. Instead my flight has been delayed by 1hr and my arrival to Toronto has been delayed by more than 6 hours. What was a direct 3 hour flight has now turned into a +6 hour multi-layover flight. What kind of second tier airline is this? In addition to this we haven't been notified of any compensation. I would not recommend this airline to anyone.

WG547 4th Nov. Returned on 18th WG 548. Do not know where the pictures they have on TV are taken but nothing like we experienced. Champagne was served (about 1 ounce in bottom of a little plastic glass). When questioned were told what do you expect for free. Staff were busy trying to sell tours or duty free for which they must get bonus as they did not care that travellers were looking for service. It was evident if not buying a tour or duty free we were seen as a nuisance. Seats were small even when we paid for elite we were put in regular seating flights were changed to having a stop coming and going from Van to Calgary so much for our direct flight to Hultuco. Best thing was the resort.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
Our package was to provide a non-stop flight to and from our vacation destination which was changed without compensation to include a stop on our return flight. After arriving at the originally unscheduled stop we were told to disembark and remove all of our carry-on's from the plane. We were herded through pouring rain to an awaiting bus deposited in a waiting area then sent through a security check. This involved personal scans and a scan of all our carryon luggage. We were then queued back through the rain to our bus back to the plane where we waited in line in the rain while passengers searched for their boarding passes required to re-enter the plan. What a disaster! I have never received such terrible service.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
Travelled from Ottawa to Varadero. Boarded the plane on time and sat on the ground for additional 30 minutes while the announcement came that they were still loading baggage. Once in the air the crew took their time getting the drink service going. 50 minutes into the 3.5 hours flight they encountered some turbulence and this continued off and on for 1.5 hours. Finally a rushed food service where they threw you a sandwich and cookies. 30 minutes before the plane landed they announced the waste system was full and the lavatories could no longer be used. Even though we spent 30 extra minutes on the ground because of baggage loading no one thought to empty the toilets on the plane.

I booked a vacation from Calgary to Varadero Cuba leaving on Oct 30/14 and returning November 7/14. Flight was scheduled to depart at 7 am and I was advised we must be at the airport 3 hours in advance (4 am) as the check in counter closes 1 hour prior to departure. They also advise that you check your flight status before you leave for the airport to ensure there are no delays which I did right before I left home and the flight was "on time". I arrived at the airport as instructed to find a huge line up at the check in counter however no Sunwing staff in sight. I again checked the flight status and it was still saying "On Time". After waiting for an hour and continuously checking the flight status I attempted to contract the call center which does not open until 6 am ironically. Eventually 2 hours later Sunwing staff showed up to check us in after waiting at the counter. When questioned as to why we were delayed I was advised by a Sunwing employee "I don't know why they tell you to be here 3 hours in advance we don't start work until 6 am". Finally we check in rush through security and board the plane. On the plane I found the flight attendants lazy and rude. You had to request drinks as well as snacks and after enough people started asking they finally came around. On a 6 hour flight they only offered a tiny glass of pop/water to drink twice. If you asked for anything you received attitude. I found the breakfast sandwich to be decent however although I may have just been that hungry as I missed my chance to eat anything before boarding due to the delay on the part of Sunwing. The seats are really uncomfortable and you have no room. The person in front reclined their seat and practically hit me with it. Their TV's are hard to see and movie choices were terrible. Finally made it to Varadero and thankfully the resort was great. On the way home flight was on time we actually watched it arrive and saw all the passengers deplane. Then again without any explanation were delayed with no Ssunwing staff around to advise when they would be boarding or advise there was a delay. Overall the service was the same on the way back The flight attendants were not attentive at all and you had to ask for drinks. I normally fly Westjet and I can say there is no comparison between the two. I am not a fan of Air Canada but can safely say I would fly them no questions asked before I would ever fly Sunwing again.

Everything was good! Take off on time free lunch and free glass of wine and the crew were kind! Same thing for the return journey! It was a 4 hr flight and everything was good. Low cost vacation so I am eager to book my next trip with Sunwing!

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
Edmonton-Las Vegas on Oct 30 2014 and returned on November 2. Overall very happy with the Sunwing product. Sure the return flight time was not ideal (landing at 2 am on Monday morning but all things considered - solid product. I booked within 14 hours of departure and got a great deal. The planes are newer - 737 next gens and everything that comes along with that - the mood lighting the overhead bins the new plane feel. Sure there is no seat back TV and seat size/recline a little less than some airlines but for what Sunwing is and what they do I think they do it well. Customer service was great food was good (and inclusive) the tunes playing upon boarding and arrival over the speakers and the flight deck announcements/updates gave it that appeal of flying (like it used to be 20 years ago). Everyone has to understand that yes there could be delays and their routes can change last minute but the are a charter airline and do not have the fleet size as the majors.

Returning to Toronto from Varadero Cuba. Flight WG683 was supposed to leave from Varadero at 8.30 pm on Monday October 27 2014 arriving to Toronto 11.55pm. We flew with Elite Plus. Our flight was delayed 4 hours we were told at the last minute. We had to hang around the hotel dressed to leave. We did not get seated before everyone else as our flight going to Varadero we had to stand in line with everyone else. We also did not get champagne service. Why did we pay elite plus? I was very disappointed.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
We went from Vancouver to Cancun on October 19th and we were about 25 min late leaving Vancouver but this was because air traffic control closed down some of the air space on the original flight path so that was not anyone's fault. I was very impressed with the hot towel service and the hot meal you get. Staff were very good at what they do. There is only one thing that needs major improvement and that is the inflight entertainment. On both our outbound and return flight they had several problems trying to get the movie to work properly and if you ask me they were too worried about trying to fix this issue when they should have been bringing around drinks for there customers. I understand that one of the things that is advertised is the movie but really all in all my only complaint is that I should have had water or pop a lot earlier than when I got it. I will definitely choose this airline again for our future travel.

We traveled from Halifax to Orlando in March. The line up for check in was long but this was due to a computer problem took over an hour flight left on time. The return flight was an 90 mins late leaving seats are tight but overall trip was fine. We already have a trip booked with Sunwing to Florida for February 15. We are upgrading our seating this time. I have travel on many different airlines and this one is about average good value for the money.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
I travelled to Jamaica from Sept 27-Oct 4 2014. We had read so many reviews about Sunwing (not many positive ones) before we left (but after we had already booked the trip) and were worried and dreaded the flight. Honestly we worried for nothing. I realize other people have had horrible experiences but we had nothing but positive experiences. Everyone from the counter staff to the stewardesses and captains were nothing but courteous friendly and kind. Anything we needed they were more than happy to help with. The flight itself was on time smooth and comfortable. They served champagne and hot sandwiches on board and we got to see some new decent movies onboard also. I can't say enough about my experience with them. I wouldn't hesitate to book with Sunwing again. I don't usually write reviews but felt that they deserved a positive review amongst all the negative. I am a serious traveller and been to many places on a few different airlines. The level of service I experienced with Sunwing was literally 100x better than the experience I had when I went to NYC in May with another airline that I shall not name. I am pleased with every aspect of my first Sunwing experience.

Take note! If you are planning a vacation with Sunwing please think again. This charter airline is starting to get a bad reputation due to their continual delays getting people to their destination or home. We are in Puerto Vallarta and were supposed to go home today. Our flight has been delayed by 14 hours! Unacceptable and never again.

After getting to Vancouver airport for a 7am flight we were informed that our flight was delayed and we would be leaving at 3pm. So off to a friends place we went seeing as we don't live in Vancouver and have a 19 month old with us. Upon returning to the airport we were told that it was delayed again to 5.45 and they gave us a $20 food credit to make up for it. After we finished lunch we walked back into the airport and on the departure listing our flight was delayed again this time 7.40 pm so now we have been waiting for over 12hr and have lost a day from our holiday. I will never travel with them again.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
We just got back from our trip to Santa Clara Cuba on 23-30th August 2014. Our airline was Sunwings. It was our first experience of flying with that company. When the departure from Toronto to Cuba got 3 hours delayed we understood and waited patiently for out flight. Our vacation in Iberostar Ensenachos was absolutely amazing but the flight back from Santa Maria to Toronto on 30th August was awful. The flight got delayed more than once and the overall delay was over 9 hours. Moreover that delay was during night time and all of us (with our children) spent all that time waiting with our luggage in the hotel lobby bus station and airport. Got home exhausted frustrated and more tired than before the vacation. We recovered from that trip for two days and the impression of the vacation was ruined due to the flight experience. Flying with Sunwings is a waste of money and energy. It was our first and last trip with Sunwings airlines.

On Aug 28 2014 I booked a flight to St. John's N.L. The flight was suppose to leave at 8.20am and arrive in St. John's at 12.50pm. The flight was delayed 6 hours! We didn't arrive until 7pm that evening. I was very disappointed that the airlines had no one there to tell us what was going on or that the flight was delayed they should have shown some common courtesy by having someone to explain. Instead we stood in a line that wasn't moving wondering why it wasn't moving. We were told once we got to the desk. I was disgusted. I was to attend a wedding rehearsal and missed it so thank you very much!! I will not make this mistake again and booking a flight with this airlines. Oh but Thank you for the $14.00 food voucher that I did not use.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
We just returned from our first trip to Cuba. Our party consisted of 8 members including our two grandchildren ages 1 and 3. Our flight down on Aug 16/14 was delayed 4 hours supposedly as a result of an incident with a plane in Vancouver 36 hours previous? This caused us to arrive at the resort at 3am instead of 11pm as expected. Our return flight WG0305 on Aug 23/14 was also delayed 1.5 hours causing us to arrive back in Toronto at 3am clearing the airport by 4am. I found the communication at YYZ explaining the delay was non existent every time the delay was extended no one said anything. In Cuba the communication of the delay was again not communicated. The pilot indicated it was a result of other flights during the day being delayed thus resulting in our problem. Sunwing and advertise themselves as a family friendly vacation. I think they need to put more effort into improving the reliability of the flight times to allow young families to travel and arrive at a more reasonable time not force them to arrive at destinations well after expected times.

July 19th 2014 flew to Cayo Santa Maria Cuba. At the airport our gate changed four times. We were supposed to be at our hotel by 10.30pm arrived around 2am. Our stay at the hotel was great! No complaints. Now coming home that is a different story. Found out our flight was going to be delayed by 5 hours tried to talk to the Sunwing rep to get anther room because we had four children with us under the age of 8. They were no help and didn't care. We then went and talked to the hotel staff and they found us a room. We were now not supposed to be picked up until 10.30pm. It is an hour and half trip to the airport. We did not land until 7am in Toronto. All of us were up for over 24 hours. That was my first experience with them. Needless to say this is not a one time thing and will never fly with them again. Pay the extra and you will arrive to your vacation on time.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
Flew to Los Cabos Dec 5 2013 stopped at Puerto Vallarta on the way down and back. Returned to Toronto a week later. My vacation was ruined because I chose to use Sunwing. The lengthy layovers baggage problems their poor planning terrible food and a tendency to do everything on the cheap regardless of the impact on their passengers. I have never had such terrible food. It would be better just to dispense with meals altogether. The flight staff were so rude. All I asked for was one option that was more in accordance to my lactose reduced diet. They had run out and when I complained I was told to be quiet. If you consider the amount of extra time you have to spend when travelling with them vs another airline you will soon realize that the amount of time you lose beside the pool and your added aggravation could easily offset the savings. Pay a bit more so that your period of relaxation is not filled with stress and frustration and consider the extra time you can spend at the resort.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
July 31-Aug 8 2014. The flight was supposed to depart from Toronto at 5 pm arriving at 8.30 pm in Varadero Cuba. First it was delayed until 6.50 pm and then until 11.50 pm (although it took off later than that). The lady at the check-in counter said that there were "mechanical" issues. We accepted that things happen but it wasn't easy for our 4 children to arrive at the Cuban hotel and go to bed at 6.30 am! On the way back the shuttle bus was supposed to pick us up at the hotel at 6pm for a 9.30pm flight. We confirmed the flight was on time with our hotel Sunwing representative at 4pm and hurriedly showered to get ready for the bus. After waiting 45 minutes in the lobby for the bus we checked with the front desk and were advised that the flight had been delayed by 3 hours therefore the bus would be by at 9pm. Our Sunwing representative had said that any delays would be posted on his bulletin board which is where we checked before 6pm and it wasn't there. Apparently the change came around 5.30pm after he had left but the staff didn't post it on his board so we had no clue. We went to the lobby again at 9pm only to hear that our bus wasn't coming until 11pm - two more hours to wait in limbo. Eventually the bus showed up at almost 12am and we departed at 3.30 am! Luckily we live close to the airport and were in bed by 8.30 am. So what are the chances that the same airline would have "mechanical" issues again a week later and at the same time? Why keep delaying the flight every couple of hours? I'm sure they know more than 2 hours ahead of a flight. At least if we knew that we had all those hours to wait at the onset we would have managed our time more efficiently instead of sitting and waiting. It is bad enough to have over 6 hour delays on 3.5 hour flights but when it starts to interfere with eating and sleeping patterns then something has to be done! Unfortunately it seems that our story is one of many and it doesn't seem to be changing anything with the way Sunwing runs its operation. This is a warning from another unsatisfied family to anyone who is considering a vacation with them to really evaluate if saving a few dollars is worth the hassle especially when travelling with children.

Terrible airline. First and only time I will fly with them. Flight to Punta Cana delayed by a late pilot by 3 hours. Pushed our arrival to past 1am. No rep at the resort to help with schedules just a binder. Consulted binder on return trip day. It said 5pm. No transfer arrived by 5.45pm. Worried I would miss my flight I took a $70 cab. At the airport there was no one from Sunwing. A very helpful Air Canada employee informed us of the delay another 5 hours. No way to get through the gate to food or water. Originally due into to Pearson at 2am arrived at 6am. Excuses from the crew was that they have been late for the last eight days and can't seem to make it up. My recommendation is they hire Air Canada to pickup their slack. I highly recommend that you don't fly this airline.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
Flight to Jamaica was fine the return flight was a nightmare. Sunwing bus picked us up at hotel lobby at 6.25 am before breakfast was served. Arrived at Montego Bay airport at approximately 9.00 am by the time we checked luggage got through customs and walked across airport to terminal we had only a few minutes to do some Duty Free shopping then board the plane for 10.40 am not enough time to eat. Once on the plane we flew to Puerto Plata waited an hour for people to exit and new people to board. At 4.00 pm I informed the Stewardess that we haven not had an opportunity to eat she blamed us for booking into the flight late despite using their transportation. When they did serve food they ran out by the time they got to us. We had two young kids with us who did not get a proper meal until 9.00 pm. The Stewardess was extremely rude to both myself and my husband sitting in different rows in different conversations/situations.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
Travelled to Cayo Cocco July 3rd 2014. All great except for check in at Toronto Pearson. I had paid $50 extra for the premium package. This gives priority boarding and check in. There is a woman employed by Sunwing that goes along check-in line checking tickets. She told me I was in the wrong line and was to go to the regular line or pay $40 dollars more to stay in the priority check-in line. I knew this was false as the same woman had done the exact thing to myself and my sister in April 2013. At that time I did not know the difference and paid another $50 on top of the $50 already paid. This latest episode by said employee was very embarrassing as she flat out told me loudly I was wrong and to move. I did not move and the girl at ticket desk apologized and assured me that I was indeed in the right line. So beware if you have purchased Premium package and someone tells you that you are not to be in the PremiumElite Plus line and to pay more. I am travelling to Cuba again next month so it will be interesting to see if the same thing happens.

I traveled from Mexico Cancun on July 16 2014. Myself and my daughter had to check out of our hotel room at noon. Our flight back to Toronto WG 514 was supposed to be at 20.10 and pick up from the hotel at 16.45. When we went around 16.20 to check on our pick up bus to the airport we noticed the Flight Alert and delay from 20.10 to 23.59. In the addition on the alert notice was a mistake to the flight number and original time - mistake from the Sunwing representative. Anyway we were picked up at 20.35 and driven to the airport. Our flight did not leave at midnight what was already 4 hrs of delay we left around 1 am. On the plane we were told that the flight crew was not to blame for this delay that Sunwing is responsible for not scheduling our pick up from Cancun. The flight crew were working on their days off to get us to Toronto. Picking up the luggage took over an hour. The conveyer delivered a few suitcases and as we found out after a few travelers started to get very annoyed tired some with small children the conveyer jammed. They brought the rest of bags on the carts. The whole time in Cancun was very relaxing but the trip back drained all of it out of us. It was my first time using Sunwing next time I will try to avoid them.

Vancouver to Toronto on June 22 red eye and returned on the Toronto to Vancouver 8.30 pm flight. Both flights were delayed. On the Van-TO I was told that they were waiting for a pilot to arrive and we waited 1.5 hours. When we finally boarded although it was obviously a red eye running from 10.30pm to arrive at 6am (original schedule) they did their best to keep us awake during the flight by making loud announcements keeping the lights on and serving us sandwiches/pizza or drinks. On the TO-Van return we were delayed 5 hours. When I checked in at 5pm I was told that they were waiting for a plane to arrive at 10pm so the flight was delayed until 11pm. This time changed again to 12.01 am and we finally left at 1.30 am. When the time stretched to a 5 hour delay the only thing the airline offered was a $15 food voucher. The flight back was better for sleeping. This is truly a case of you get what you pay for. I will never fly Sunwing again.

I traveled with Sunwing June 17 2014. The flight was a complete disaster. My flight was supposed to leave Pearson International at 5.15pm and arrive at Juan Gonzalez airport Varadero Cuba at 8.45pm. The flight got delayed 6 hrs and there was not 1 single Sunwing rep at the gate to tell me what was going on. I left the gate and went to the Sunwing baggage check in they had no idea why the flight was delayed. They gave me a measly $10 food voucher. Flight ended up leaving at 11pm and I did not get to my resort until 3am. Same on the way back 2 hr delay getting home.

Flew from Toronto flight WG732 on June 20th going to Montego Bay. Coming back was WG 733 on June 27th. I booked a wheelchair and the service I received was excellent. Both ways the wheelchair was ready without delay. Our seats were booked both ways at the start of our trip to make it more convenient. This is consistent with our experience in past.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
Very disappointed with Sunwing all around. Booked a "direct" return flight (April 27 - May 9) Edmonton - Montego Bay. It turns out the advertised direct flight made a stop in Calgary to pick up more people and stopped on the way back as well to let people off. We paid the extra $$$ for Elite seating yet those seats (1a and b) had no extra leg room and were not wider as stated for elite booking. The aircraft was very very old and so small that it could only offer "Bistro Service" in other words sandwiches. The 10 hour return flight was brutally uncomfortable. Their customer service department could not care less when I wrote a complaint. Sunwing has lost our business for life.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
Our vacation from Edmonton Al. to Santa Maria Cuba - terrible never again. Flight delayed 15 hrs! Sure they put us at the resort for an extra night but that meant 1.5 hr bus ride back and forth to the resort 4 times. On the return flight our so called breakfast was 2 dry pieces of bread no butter a slice of ham and pepperoni slice of cheese and 2 cookies. This was served at 10.30am no lunch and arrived at 3.30pm to Edmonton.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
After a wonderful flight to Varadero Cuba on May 22 2014 my husband and I were disappointed on our return flight to Toronto on May 29th. Our flight was scheduled to return at 10.30pm while at our hotel one of the other guests had received a travel alert that our flight was delayed until 12.05am. The Sunwing representative was nowhere to be located at the resort and the hotel staff indicated that since they had not been advised of any changes the bus was scheduled to picked returning guests at 7.00pm. Upon our arrival at the airport the flight indicated that it was on time at the regular scheduled departure needless to say it was incorrect and we were sitting at the airport over five hours with no explanation! Once on the flight no explanation due to the delay. If we wanted to fly on a red eye we would have booked one. We did not arrive home until 5.30am. Not good customer service by today's standards and expectations.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
We booked a trip to Cuba. We liked the fact they offered earlier flights going to Cuba and coming back. 3 times that week we had seen people stranded at the resort because of flight delays. Reason they said was mechanical delays. We didn't think anything until it was our turn to leave the bus did not show up at the correct time to pick us up. When we checked out they phoned to find out where the bus was told our flight was delayed until 11pm putting us in Toronto at 3.30 am in the morning. We were told mechanical problems again. When we get on the plane the pilot proceeds to tell us another story of why we were delayed. Personally I would avoid this airline.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
I flew with Sunwing for the first time in January of this year. I was supposed to fly to Varadero Cuba for five nights starting January 11th. My flight to Varadero was delayed a total of 7 times for a total of 23.5 hours. I missed out on 20% of my trip with zero compensation. I know it's January and the weather could be bad that time of year but the weather that day was more like spring no snow no bad weather so I still don't know what all the delays were for. My flight from Cuba back to Ottawa was supposed to leave on January 16th at 8:15 PM : this flight was delayed until 5am the next morning. At 5am the next morning we were all waiting at the airport with no plane in sight. The plane arrived around 7am not a single announcement to let travellers know what the delays were for - when we left Varadero shortly after 7:00am the departure monitor still said 5am (two hours in the past). After months of filling complaints with Sunwing the final result is that they game me a $50 voucher for one of my flights and a $100 voucher for my other flight. I also got a $50 voucher for filling out the customer satisfaction survey. Read the fine print and they have to be used within the next 8 months their non-transferrable they can't be redeemed for cash they can't be used if there's any kind of sale on (Sunwing always has sales on) and I can only use 1 voucher per vacation. So the money I'll spend on one of their vacations with a voucher is way more than the money I'd spend if I just bought a vacation when it's on sale.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
Traveling with 3 small kids we carefully selected flights that will work for them and not be disruptive to other passengers (day/morning flights). Sunwing cancelled our day flight and moved us to one night flight there and a red eye return. We NEVER would have booked a trip with our young family with those flights. When we called for help the response was pretty much "we're a charter and don't care about our customers". The only solution they offered was for us to book another day with the hotel directly so our kids can nap in preparation for the red eye home at our own expense of course. We are now dreading the family vacation we saved so long for. Thanks Sunwing on behalf of my family and our fellow passengers who will be wondering why on earth we would take 3 children on a night flight and a red eye!

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
Flown YHZ (Halifax Canada) to PIE (St. Petersburg FL) on April 24 and return May 11 from MCO-YHZ. On the inbound to USA flight we purchased Elite Plus class which gives you extra room and priority check-in plus extra luggage weight (52 lbs vs 44 lbs each person). The regular service is good enough and it seems more than generous so I am not sure if Elite Plus is necessary. Those extra few for the seating area are nice though. Check-in was fast and courteous and take off was on time. Onboard everyone is served free non-alcoholic beverages and a warm breakfast sandwich. Flight attendants were very friendly and attentive. Arrival in St. Petersburg was about 15 min earlier. The plane was in great shape and very clean. Sunwing has some of the newest planes in the industry (Boeing 737-800). Onboard entertainment is shown on small LCD screens dropping down from the ceiling. Normally a recent DVD release will be shown and some other current US shows. Headphones are provided free of charge but are not the best in the world. Return flight to Canada on May 11 was equally impressive. Everything was on time or a bit earlier the flight crew was beyond nice something you don't see too often nowadays. We were also served free non-alcoholic beverages and choice of warm sandwich or pizza. Last time I've got free warm food on a flight was when taking flights to Europe so this was a bit surprising and pleasant. From Canada I've flown Air Canada and WestJet but in my opinion Sunwing got them beat. The flight got into Halifax about 30 min earlier than scheduled. The price was very good compared to the competition and the service was great. I would definitely recommend Sunwing to anyone going to Florida or beyond.

Flights WG589 on 28th April and WG590 on 5th May. I have taken 3 trips to date with Sunwing planning a fourth in September. I have never had a problem with this airline and wouldn't hesitate to recommend them. We had a situation 2 weeks ago on a flight to Cancun where we had 3 wedding parties start the party early one passenger even started smoking in the toilet! The cabin crew handled the situation well. I felt sorry for them. Delays happen not always the fault of the airline. I usually pay for elite plus seats makes a huge difference.

On April 22nd we (group of 4 passengers) took Sunwing from Montreal to Cancun. It took more than an hour to get our luggage! When we got back on May 6th we had to drop passengers in Quebec City before getting to Montreal airport a 6 hours flight instead of 4 hours and not a direct flight. Last time we took Sunwing to Cancun 7 years ago we had a 12 hour delay for the departure and we had to travel during the night.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
I was a passenger on flight WG511 departing from Pearson airport on March 15 2014. This flight was delayed 11 hours 2 of which we were kept on the airplane while repairs were attempted. This was my third flight with Sunwing and I have never been treated so poorly during this delay. The communication to passengers was absolutely despicable not to mention the treatment we received from airline staff while waiting for answers. We were left to frequently check the flight boards for any updates which constantly changed throughout the day leaving us with no real answers. The $15.00 meal voucher system was beyond unorganized. Lining 200+ people up waiting for these hand-written vouchers is unacceptable and this happened twice during our delay. Upon boarding we were given a sheet with instructions on how to claim the loss of an entire day of our all inclusive vacation through insurance as well as a $75 voucher for our next Sunwing flight. The $75 voucher offered was unacceptable.

Travel to Florida in February 2014 and our flight was 2 hours late leaving Halifax and 2 hours late leaving Florida on the return. Tried Sunwing again in April of 2014 for a vacation to Cuba. Our flight was 3 hours late leaving Halifax and our flight was 3 hours late leaving Cuba. Never again will we fly with Sunwing.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
I have flown Sunwing 4 times. Twice they have been normal if you are a tall person and need normal leg room do not fly Sunwing. They cramp you in like sardines. 2 bad experiences: Cancun: Our flight was 3.5 hours delayed we were scheduled to leave at 0600 did not leave until 0930. When we got into Cancun we waited 1.5 hrs for luggage. 2nd time - En route to Varadero - our flight was delayed 13 hours out of London all they gave us was a $15 meal voucher for the day. They later gave us $150 credit to book a trip at regular price with them - I would never fly with them again.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
Returned from Varadero Cuba yesterday. Flight delayed several hours. We were supposed to be picked up at the resort 1.30 am. However at 12.50 am we were advised our flight was delayed and we wouldn't be leaving the resort until 6.45 am. Back down to pick-up area - the Sunwing bus was late and didn't arrive until 8.30. No information on when the plane was actually leaving. When we arrived at the airport lines were ridiculous. We were in our third line-up for customs - at the back of another huge line-up when they announced our flight was boarding. Pushed our way to front of line - got yelled at incessantly but got through. We were supposed to arrive in Edmonton 9.50 am local time we got home 3.30 pm. When arrived we discovered our friends luggage was left in Cuba. Not sure if we'll go back our resort.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
My issue stems from what is essentially a bait and switch scheme used by the carrier. On September 28 2013 I paid for a direct flight from Vancouver BC to Huatulco Mexico leaving March 18 2014. On February 10 2014 by email the carrier changed the flight to include a stopover in Calgary effectively adding over three hours on the plane each way. Sunwings position is that I got a direct flight as I did not change planes in Calgary and that what I was really looking for was a non-stop flight. Notwithstanding that from a travellers point of view the difference in nomenclature is without distinction. It effectively says do not rely on Sunwings advertised flight schedules. I paid a premium price for a direct flight. I did not receive what I paid for.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
We were to leave Ottawa for Orlando on Feb 15 2014 at 6am 11.5 hrs later we finally left. Technical difficulties with the plane which we totally understand! But how we were treated was not acceptable. We were not kept aware at all what was going on. From status of plane to when we were leaving to finally no crew! I understand crew can only be there for a certain time length but when it was getting close why was the next crew not notified. But it took them 4+ hrs to get the crew there and then find out plane was not fixed at all where as we had been told it was! Even dealing with Sunwing after we were back they do not like to respond to emails other than standard letters that are not acceptable! We will not be using Sunwing again nor will we ever recommend them.

April 11-18 Toronto to Holguin Cuba. Flight WG388/WG389. Outbound flight was 10 minutes ahead of schedule and inbound flight was 20 minutes ahead of schedule. Service was good. The crew worked very hard to make sure you enjoyed their service. Along with free wine and hot meal. Very happy with them if schedule is OK will definitely fly with them again!

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
Flew to Cuba from Fredericton food has gone donehill this was our 7th and last trip to Cuba. Flight was late leaving Fredericton 19th April and late arriving on 26th April. No communication to us while we were waiting to be picked up in Cuba. Pizza definitely not recommended. attendant informed us we should buy the "duty free" on the trip to Cuba because the supplies would be gone on the return flight. So this was done then much to our surprise the Cuban security staff seized our "duty free" alcohol and said we could not even put it in our check in luggage on our way out of Cuba. We now have to declare what we are bringing into Cuba gifts cell phones all electrical devices we are carrying.

We flew from Toronto to Orlando and had a terrific flight! We paid the additional $15 for premium and had seat selection at the front of the plane priority boarding and extra luggage weight up to 68lbs. Was definitely worth it! Flights were on time flight attendants were very friendly and even the airplane food was decent. Highly recommend Sunwing it was a great experience.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
On a scheduled return flight from our vacation Sunwing's representatives never contacted us at the hotel to inform us that our flight was delayed. Their online site stated that the flight was on-time. When we arrived at the airport we waited for 3 hours to be told that they would not let us check in and no one was there. It wasn't until 17 hours later that our flight arrived. Horrible communication! No communication! Other passengers were informed to some degree but 30 of us were not. Would never fly Sunwing again or recommend airline to anyone.

I flew from Vancouver (Canada) to Cuba and back. Generally Sunwings provides very poor service: the unfriendly cabin crew and airport check-in staff were inefficient and seemed to hate their jobs. The planes were very dirty. Sunwings is the airline to be avoided.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
The customer service is terrible both from the company and once onboard. The flight was on time but once ready for take off they had to go back. The staff had fake smiles and the service was terrible. I was with my 73 year old mother and asked for water the staff told me to wait and that that they would be serving lunch and she would get water then. The food was awful. Everything about this flight is cheap even the earphones they give you don't work. We flew with Air Canada Rouge on the way back 100 times better.

YYZ-VRA-YYZ on a Boeing 737-800. Both flights were excellent with good over-head movie options. The airline provided sandwiches which were pretty good and had pleasant staff. Seats were a little small but bearable. Transportation to and from the resort offered by Sunwing Vacations was very appealing and took care of us very well.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
We flew from Halifax to St Petersburg Florida return this year. I was extremely nervous to fly this airline when I read some of the reviews but I have to say our experience was fine. The staff were friendly (for the most part). The bistro meals were a little disappointing. We were about 1/2 hour late going south and about 1 hr late heading home. No big deal. We were over weight and had to pay an extra $30 for the 3 kgs we were over. My only complaint is that for flights to somewhere other than an all inclusive the weight should be increased. Overall the experience with Sunwing was positive.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
Christmas Day 2013…flying to Cancun with my fiancé. Scheduled to arrive at 4.30pm Dec 25th in Cancun.Actual arrival time: 3.30am Dec 26th. Dec 25th 7.45 am: Arrive at airport to find flight delayed from 10 am to 4.30 pm. Offered $15 food voucher for airport or a cab ride home - no explanation of why there was a delay. We got a hotel room at the airport. At 12.00 pm the departure time changed again to 6.30 pm. At 2.00 pm the departure time changed again to 8.50 pm arriving in Cancun at 3.30 am Dec 26th. Throughout the day we tried calling Sunwing and received a busy signal every time. At 6.45 we left the hotel and made the 5 min walk to the check in desks to find no one at the desks and nothing showing on the screens. At 7.30 a Sunwing agent arrives at the desk. We asked why the flight was delayed and why there was no one there to check us in and she wouldn't answer. Once checked in we head to the gate and it is announced on the overhead speaker that Sunwing will be offering a $75 travel voucher per person for the delay. This is so distasteful considering we paid $442 per day per person for the vacation. Once onboard the pilot came out to make the announcement that they did not have a flight crew. He offered our first drink on him and first wine is always free anyway. We waited just over 2 hours for the first drink/snack cart to come around so thankfully we had brought our own drinks and snacks. That was the only time they came around. Arrived at Cancun airport at 3.30 am and as expected there was only one customs agent working. Our flight home luckily wasn't quite as bad. We only had to change gates because the wrong one was listed on our ticket wait in the hot hallway for 20 minutes after going through the gate because the planing process was so inefficient and took off 35 minutes late. We should have known not to fly with them again but we thought it a normal delay not a regular occurrence.

Took Sunwing to Cuba March 21 and returned March 28. Was a little worried because of all the bad reviews I read before hand but I was pleasantly surprised. Flight was on time had good food and champagne on the way there took the VIP on the way back which was worth the 25 extra dollars got to sit in an air conditioning room with free drinks and food. All in all had a good experience and I will fly with them again.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
My fiancé and I were booked to fly to Cayo Santa Maria (CUBA) February 6-13 2014. Our flight was scheduled to leave at 6.10am. Upon arriving at the airport at 4.30am we quickly noticed that the line up was very long. When we finally got to the check-in desk they asked us where we were headed we replied Cayo Santa Maria. We advised her that we had checked in online already and we just needed to print our boarding passes. She took our baggage and weighed it. Right before she was about to send it off a rude manager from the back came and just yelled out "gates to Santa Clara are closed". We were so shocked because it was only 4.55am at that time. We told them the plane would just be sitting there we could still make it. The rep simply told us "please step aside we need to assist other passengers". We found out there were 6 other passengers with us that was left behind. They told us to go to all the other airlines and check if they have open seats and that we are liable for it. Long story short we had to purchase another package for the next morning with same flight time. We knew they were lying to us because we did not board the plane until 5.58am. Please do yourself a favour and pay that extra bucks to avoid any hassle with these unprofessional company.

After a complete disaster of a trip with Sunwing in January I have finally heard back from them regarding my complaint and the best they could do is recite a few paragraphs from the terms and conditions. Our flight was re- routed to Cuba plus we were 5 hours late in leaving to begin with. We didn't get to Cancun until after midnight! On the way home they did it again as we went through Cuba and didn't arrive home until after midnight. So that was 2 days of our 7 day vacation gone! And all they said was sorry but that's what you signed up for.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
I was wondering why Sunwing would put small children in elite class to fill seats that were not paid for. I paid for my son and myself but when I find out 3 kids along with their parents were upgraded to fill the seats. Maybe adults would be better to fill the seats to keep people paying for the service. I have never seen so many people up moving around elite class to use the washroom at the front of the plane. Flight crew were great maybe a little more consideration for the paying elite both ways.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
My wife and I travelled to the Dominican Republic in February. The flight was an hour late (weather) but it was uneventful. The food was good and the crew were helpful. However there's no legroom. I thought Air Transat and Canjet were bad for legroom (Canjet is the worst) but you seem to think that people over five feet tall can get by with the same leg room as shorter people. The 737 is a wonderful aircraft but when you stuff it full of people one can only conclude that corporate greed trumps creature comfort. I'll be sticking with West Jet and Air Canada and I can hardly wait for Porter to get their jets so we can be comfortable on our flights to the Dominican Republic or Cuba or anywhere else for that matter. I understand you charge a premium for extra leg room.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
I'm a horrible flyer the slightest turbulence puts me in a panic so I often rely on the comforting faces of the cabin crew. We flew from North-bay via Ottawa to Cuba. To my surprise we were offered Champagne then a meal with beverages and ice-cream. What I really appreciated about this flight was the pilot constantly updated passengers eg: 'Clear skies up ahead if you look to your left you can see Florida Keys etc'. We had no delays.

The cabin crew were very pleasant and always busy. Our flights were on time. All in all it was a positive experience.

My wife and I have gone on trips on Sunwing before but never again. We were on flight 338 in January this year. They messed up our reservations from first class to economy class we landed at another airport sat on the runway for 2hrs were then put in the airport for 9hrs but did not go through customs (so we could not leave the airport) then taken to a resort (not ours) for 3hrs then back to the airport to wait another 5hrs. We lost 24hrs.

March 6 2014 and March 13 2014. Winnipeg to Los Cabos Mexico return flight good cabin staff friendly and helpful although pilot a little hard to understand (WG494) and half an hour early. The flight to Cabo was different the cabin crew was almost lazy and personal conversations seemed to be a priority (WG493). We arrived early but after a rough flight due to turbulence. Elite plus is a joke sitting in row one but my carry on is in row four luggage out first in Cabo but in Winnipeg different story. Wake up Sunwing and address some of these simple issues!

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
March 5th 2014 from Ottawa Canada to Cuba WG 630. They announced that the flight was going to be delayed 1 hour no explanation why. They started boarding and we took off only 1/2 hour late. There were 6 of us 2 were seated together and remaining 4 were put in aisle seats side by side. On the way back from Cuba on March 12th 2014 WG 631 we were slow going through immigration no fault of Sunwing. Finally arrived to our plane at 10.35am the doors immediately closed and the plane took off 5 minutes later 20 minutes earlier than expected. The 6 of us were pretty much split up by 2 each seating my 12 old daughter by herself behind us. Overall the staff were great very friendly and approachable. The food served was pretty good considering most airlines don't offer meal service for free. It was comparable to meals we've had to purchase on other airlines.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
Winnipeg to Montego Bay March 3 return March 10. Flight down was good with the exception of the meal. Cold egg and bacon sandwich. Why offer a warm towel before the meal? Couldn't understand the point of that. Our return departure was moved up by one hour due to time change. We were sitting in our room. They did not call us. The biggest part of this problem is the way the Sunwing rep handled the situation and told me I'd have to take a taxi to the airport. Made it to the gate just as boarding was starting. Sunwing needs to provide more time to get through the airport - seat designation as well as security takes a long time - there are a lot of people going through these vacation spot airports! Flight home was better for food - hot beef sandwich - yes I said hot - wonder how it didn't cool down while being handed out? There was one flight attendant who was unpleasant the whole trip - another passenger said she remembered her from a previous flight. So the destination was beautiful and warm but Sunwing left a bad taste. Would never choose to fly Sunwing again.

We will never fly Sunwing again! On March 4th we flew to Memories Santa Clara. We were to depart at 7.10pm but never left until 11.10pm. Given a $5.00 voucher for food. The fight was ok going down. On the day of departure the bus picked us up at 4.00. The flight WG 0341 was supposed to leave at 8.55 but didn't leave until 9.39. We had cold pizza on flight and were not given anything to drink (water) except for the initial beverage. We landed and got through the gate at 3.00am only to find out they had lost our luggage!

WG416 on Feb 20th from Ottawa. WG417 on Feb 27th from Puerta Plata. There was total confusion in the airport as to which line to go in. The Elite Plus or the regular poorly organized people didn't know where to go and the elite Plus is a joke! When we first arrived early at the airport there were no staff members at the counter we had to wait an hour for anyone to arrive. The food is the worst I have had on any airline in my 40 years of flying. The seating was tight and the hot towel service was just silly. They should have spent more time serving drinks. And having to rent pillows and blankets thanks for the lousy customer service. Will be looking at other airlines in the future.

Liberia to Toronto on February 6th. Considering that their prices are amongst the highest I purchased a promotion buy one get half off it still cost us just over $800 each. They can keep their champagne (one way only) and the awful food they serve and lower the cost. Paid more for the extra legroom I don't know how anyone could sit comfortably in the regular seats. Flew American last year with layover in Miami and would definitely consider again. Lovely updated aircraft roomy seats no meals but price was over $150 less. Only reason I booked direct was I was travelling with my 90 year old mother the layover would have been too much for her. I didn't consider Sunwing food a meal we could not eat it it was that bad hot bistro meal was a slice of pizza that tasted awful. Flight attendants were very nice check in staff were great in Toronto and Liberia. My biggest peeve is value for dollar just not there.

February 27 2014 from Windsor to Cuba. Outgoing WG374. Return March 6 2014 WG 375. Great flight to and from Cuba but where was the champagne as promised. Both ways no champagne. Also coming home the ending of the movie was cut short because of landing. We will travel with them again even without the champagne.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
My wife and I spent a great deal of time and research finding a vacation to the Mayan Riviera that left Vancouver at an appropriate time to fit with our schedule. We chose a Sunwing flight with a 10am departure and a direct flight to Cancun with a 6pm return direct to Vancouver a week later. We paid extra to get Elite Plus (extra baggage weight extra legroom etc.). If you decide to pay this premium do not sit in the bulkhead seats. There is no more legroom to stretch out and your carry on will have to be stowed somewhere far behind you as there is not space in front of you. The exit rows are really good for legroom and convenience. Our flight was rescheduled with no warning to a 7am departure with a stop in Calgary on the way. So we had to leave home at 3 in the morning to catch the plane. On the return we were rescheduled to make a stop in Calgary before coming to Vancouver. These stops added 2.5 hours to our flight to Cancun and 3.5 hours to our flight home as weather and a crew change delayed departure from Calgary. Sunwing did not apologize or say anything about the rescheduling. There were about 80 passengers from Vancouver and we picked up less than 20 in Calgary. So Sunwing alienated 80% of its passengers to pick up a few folks. The planes both ways were only partially full so it is obvious that this total disregard for customers is seriously affecting their business. On a positive note the cabin crews were excellent both ways even though they too had been seriously disrupted by the schedule and routing changes. I will certainly never fly with Sunwing again.

Edmonton to Cancun from Feb 16-23/14. Paid extra for elite plus which was worth every penny. Roomier seats and having your luggage unloaded first along with the extra baggage allowance was great. Both flights were on time service was great and my family thought the warm meals ice cream and chocolates were a nice touch. The TV's were not that great but my kids had loaded movies on their iPads anyway so it wasn't a big deal. The 2-pronged plug in for headphones wasn't a problem as they gave you free headphones which you could take off the connector and plug in your Beats or whatever headphones you had. I would not hesitate to fly with Sunwing in the future.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
We flew Sunwing for the first time in Feb 2014 first thing I would say is you get what you pay for booked elite premium class sat in the first row had to put my carry on 5 rows behind us due to all of the crews storage. Pop down entertainment system with free headphones with dual plugs my newer ear phones would not work because this plane was so old the movies are a joke terrible screen quality all movies were censored English/German writing on the inside of plane I thought French was our second language. Water leaking on me from overhead compartment. We could not understand the pilots due to their inability to speak English the only bright spot was they had decent food and the plane was on time everyone I talked to on the flight was not happy. If you want a cheap no frills airline that might leave on time or you don't care if you luggage arrives when you do this is the right choice for you.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
2nd time with Sunwing and again delays. I will do my best never to fly with them again. We were to fly out on the 17th Feb to Cuba at 10.25 am. We were up at 4.30 arrived at airport at 6.45 am only to be told due to mechanical difficulties (same poor excuse as last year) flight delayed until 3.00 pm. At 12.30 we were back at counter to check in with all our luggage only to be told-delayed again until 10.00 pm. We had not received notification during this time nor have we yet to receive notification. They knew the day before (if not 2 days) they were behind in flight scheduling. Finally arrived at resort in Cayo Santa Maria at 4.00 am on Feb 18th. Totally exhausted I might add. Beware when flying try to avoid Sunwing at all costs.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
We booked our trip to the Bahamas from Ottawa in early January. 2 weeks after we booked what we thought would be a direct flight there and back we received an e-mail stating our departure and return times had changed and that on the way back from the Bahamas we would be flying via Varadero Cuba. We did have to get off the plane in Cuba and as a final insult despite having cleared Customs in the Bahamas less than an hour before we had to go through Cuban Customs! Just to get right back on the plane for our flight home to Ottawa. It was very bizarre and there was absolutely no need for us to get off the plane just to pick up more passengers. Our vacation was not in Cuba and we picked the Bahamas as an alternative to Cuba. Flight crew there and back were good and inflight movies were good. Food not so much. Our departure when leaving Ottawa was delayed from 11am Sunday morning to 8pm Sunday evening. Kept telling us flight delayed for 2 hours (each time) but no clear reasons given. Spent a whole day in the airport and missed a good 1/2 day at our resort arriving at midnight rather than 3 in the afternoon. Sunwing did give us food vouchers but still not a great start or finish to our vacation. Sunwing - lack of common sense.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
Just came back from Riu resort in Cuba Tuesday night and the vacation was fantastic. Return flight was late but was not Sunwings fault. When there is a discrepancy between your flight time and the departure time posted by the airport go with Sunwing website. Halifax airport had the wrong flight number.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
I would not recommend Sunwing. I recently travelled with them to the Caribbean. Our flight was 17 hours delayed. We talked to others flying Sunwing during our delay that were still delayed from the day before. On our way home again we were delayed. Once we arrived to our home airport we waited on the plane for 15-20 minutes until there was a free gate open. If you travel with Sunwing you have a good chance of a delayed plane.

We were supposed to fly out of Ottawa to Orlando last Saturday the 15th Feb at 6am. We got to the AP at 3am boarded the plane around 5.30am and then were told to exit the plane because there was a delay. Needless to say we spent the entire day sitting in the airport and didn't board until 7pm that night. We missed an entire day of our vacation because of this. Will never fly SW again.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
Went to Cuba Feb 11 2014 and returned Feb 18 seat 5b. I was disappointed with the meal service this year. I travel with Sunwing every year and ordered a vegan meal there and back. I was told the vegan meal was not available anymore only vegetarian. The meal I got was disgusting last year and the year before I got a delicious meal of rice with vegetables. I pay a lot of money to fly with them and I had nothing to eat there and back. I will be booking with someone else from now on.

Flight WG481 from YVR via Kelowna January 16th. Boarded the plane at 6.45 am at 7.15 am the pilot advised us that he would not be taking off and landing in Kelowna due to heavy fog. We got an update every 1/2 hr. until noon We were allowed off the plane promised vouchers for meals the person that promised this immediately disappeared! (At one point we were told that we had to go through customs again). Finally took off picked up the Kelowna passengers. Flight staff (new ones in Kelowna) were incredible. They tried to make up for the huge delay Never again will we fly Direct Non stop is the only way to go!

Flight WG636 YOW to HOG Feb 5 2014. Pulled back from gate on time left 30 min late due to required de-icing and landed about 20 late. Had regular seats (super-economy pitch). I'm 6'2" with long legs. The aisle seat made it bearable. Crew was young and friendly flight deck sounded British. Thomson wet lease 2 yr old 737. Complimentary hot sandwich or pizza red or white wine sparkling wine soft drinks water. No surprises uneventful. Return flight more of the same. Minor delay leaving Cuba and arrived slightly late in Ottawa. Different crew same level of service.

Jan 17 2014 - Ottawa to Varadero - travelled with spouse and child (under 10 years old). Woke up at 2.30am to do online check-in - don't waste your time it's a disaster. Departing flight delayed by 7 hours for no apparent reason. $10 vouchers given to each of us which was basically enough to cover food from Tim Horton's. Should have arrived in Varadero at 11am - but instead of having lunch on the beach I was having lunch in an airport. Finally departed at 1.15pm landing in Varadero by 6pm. By the time we arrived at the resort and were checked into our room we had lost an entire day of our vacation. Not enough food for everyone on the plane. Flight crew polite. Return flight on January 24 from Varadero left on time. Bathrooms and plane were filthy to say the least. Flight crew very nice. There was enough food on the plane for everyone this time. Entertainment was acceptable - as none of us had seen either of the movies. Kid friendly - they handed out a cute little backpack full of activities. Our son loved this. Caution: they are strict with the weight of luggage which is different for every other airline carrier - 44lbs for checked luggage 11lbs for carry on. Do not upgrade to elite if you are doing it to have a more comfortable seat - yes you get more leg room but the seats do not recline. Every little "upgrade" costs you. Next time I will pay the extra money and fly with a reputable airline.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
Charter to Huatulco wasn't the best. We purchased Premier Elite. Premier was sold as having access to lounge more leg room advance check in etc. More leg room is factual. Easier check in is factual. That part is good and why I purchased. We paid $52 for 1 hour in the premium lounge using our Sunwing voucher. Its wasn't free as shared when I booked the trip. In short complete misrepresentation of the facts. Don't sell premier Service including access to lounge without informing client that there is going to be an hourly charge. If I share with the check-in staff member that I'm a Premier passenger trust my word.

We flew Toronto to Holguin with Sunwing and left on time for our flight there. The inflight crew were very friendly and efficient. Decent food and a good movie plus a small glass of sparkling wine after take off hot face cloth handed out and a complimentary glass of wine with your pizza or sandwich. I felt spoiled. On the way home we left 20 minutes early. I would definitely use Sunwing again.

Toronto to Liberia Costa Rica on Jan 22nd flight #724 returned on Feb 6th flight #725. Considering that their prices are amongst the highest nothing special and I purchased a promotion buy one get half off second still cost us just over $800 each. They can keep their champagne (one way only) and the awful food they serve and lower the cost. Paid more for the extra legroom I don't know how anyone could sit comfortably in the regular seats. Flew American last year with a layover in Miami and would definitely consider again. Lovely updated aircraft roomy seats no meals but price was over $150 less. Only reason I booked direct was I was travelling with my 90 year old mother the layover would have been too much for her. Flight attendants were very nice check in staff was great in Toronto and Liberia.

WG 685 from Varadero to Toronto direct on Feb 2. My fiancé and myself travelled to Cuba a week ago we will never be travelling with Sunwing again. I can not comprehend why people who book trips together and are given the same confirmation numbers for their flights are not automatically seated together. Would it not be common sense that they would probably like to sit together. We will not be definitely not be using this airline for our honeymoon We were so looking forward to our trip and to not be able to be seated together for a flight just shy of 4 hours was extremely disappointing. When you run out of sandwiches by the 8th row on the return trip it should be pretty easy to figure out that your pizza is awful. Pizza is meant to be served cooked raw dough is awful!

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
We experienced a 2 hour delay leaving Ottawa Canada Feb 8/14 only to find out that our reservation at the resort we booked got us bumped to a sister hotel. No Sunwing rep the next day as he was "late" arriving. Two days later we finally got to the resort we had booked with no help from Sunwing. To add to the frustration we endured a 10 hour plus delay at the Cancun airport where we slept on the floor all night and flight left at 6.30am that day. All and all I would never use Sunwing again even after a $150 credit to be used on future trips was offered.

Flight from Ottawa to Varadero delayed 6 hours Feb 6. Return flight delayed 2 hours. On top of that we never received a registered baggage during the whole week! Bistro meal is choice between a cardboard tasting pizza stuck to the cardboard box or a greasy smoke meat sandwich stuck to the aluminium wrapping The wine served is barely drinkable.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
We flew to Santa Clara Cuba on Feb. 6 from Toronto. The plane was loaded quickly and efficiently and on time a small 20 minute delay was due to de-icing and not Sunwing itself. The aircraft was old but there was quite reasonable seat room. Airline staff were very friendly and professional. Food was ok. The champagne was a nice touch and it helped us to feel like we were finally on vacation! We landed at Santa Clara just 10 minutes past the scheduled arrival time. The flight back to Toronto a week later left on time and also arrived as scheduled. Again the crew was friendly and attentive. Just 2 complaints about the flight home this was a newer plane and the lack of seat room was astounding we were really scrunched in to the point of being quite uncomfortable. Also the audio system at my seat didn't work at all. But all in all Sunwing was just fine and I would certainly consider flying with it again.

When we first booked this trip it was going to Orlando. Then a few months later it was changed to going to St. Petersburg. On the way there it stopped at St.Peterburg then went on to Orlando. On the way back we had to go to St.Peterburg to get home. We chose to get off and drive to Orlando. If I knew this was going to be the trip I would have canceled. Flight delayed both ways by 1.5 to 2 hours. Free sandwich was not worth the delay.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
Flight to Varadero Cuba from Winnipeg on Jan 25th 2014 delayed 7 hours due to "mechanical" issues. Prior to arriving in Wpg the plane was 5 hrs late departing Cancun 5 hours late leaving Wpg to Cancun earlier in the day and several hours late the day before flying between Wpg and Varadero. If you don't make-up flying time in the first couple of trips add another plane already! The food was minimal and only edible because I was extremely hungry. Return flight from Varadero on Feb 1/2 was delayed 2.5 hrs again apparent "mechanical" issues. Received an application to mail in for a $75 "credit" towards future Sunwing travel to be used within a year not in conjunction with other "deals". Not going to happen! Unacceptable service.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
Just finally arrived back at 5am on a return flight from Santa Clara Cuba to Toronto. Flight was delayed 5 hours because the plane coming down to Cuba had "mechanical trouble". Unfortunately Sunwing has an ageing airplane fleet and no backup planes in case of breakdowns. We had the same experience when we flew Sunwing to Las Vegas last March. On a 3 day trip the flight was delayed a full day for "mechanical trouble". We flew back on another carrier and discarded our return Sunwing flight at the time. We tried them again to Cuba this year because our friends had already booked through them. Next time I will try to book anything with Sunwing.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
I flew to St Petersburgh from Halifax and back. Both times our flight was delayed about 1.5 hrs but it didn't really matter to me. They gave us a free sandwich which was good but wasn't that big and drinks the service on the plane was good both ways. They also played a movie on the flights as well. Overall we had a good experience.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
Staff are very friendly food was terrible. During check-in in Cancun I noticed our line wasn't moving but there were lots of people getting checked in. As we approached I could see that there were 3 economy check-ins and one elite however all desks checked in the elite passengers before economy. On our return flight there was no entertainment. On the way to Cancun one of the toilets was out of service. There is little cushioning in the seats.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
Our original booking was for Feb 16 to the 23 with direct flights both ways from Ottawa to Freeport Bahamas. About three weeks ago we received an email that our return flight was changed to having a layover in Cuba and changing our times as well. After reading the reviews I decided that Cuba was not a lay over I was willing to make so I rescheduled our flight to Feb 1 to Feb 8 from Ottawa to Orlando Florida. The flight down was delayed two hours due to inadequate staff and the return flight was delayed two hours due to mechanical issues. The food down was terrible the food on return flight not too bad. Staff were polite.

We flew from Toronto Pearson to Varadero Cuba 27 Jan - with all the negative reviews on here I was ready for problems. Arrived at the airport at 4 am for our 6.15 flight - we had bought Elite Plus - walked right up to the counter and was checked in immediately - plane loaded on time we were the first to board as stated with the Elite Plus - even with de-icing we were in the air quickly - food is typical plane food no better no worse. Luggage was off first so it was waiting for us when we went to pick it up. Return flight was the same boarding no problem - 1/2 hr late not worth even mentioning. Crew were polite and friendly captain kept us informed. These planes are no bigger or smaller or the food any different than any other airline.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
Left for Riviera Maya January 17th from Montreal. Flight was delayed because for some reason our plane hadn't arrived yet. We didn't receive any explanation for this. On our return trip our flight was delayed 3 hours and the excuse given was that our plane was there but the crew was not. The worse thing about that return trip was they put the delay on the board and then increased the delay by 5-10 minutes each time. That is infuriating because as clients we feel taken for fools (as well as cattle) why couldn't they just set a time and stick with it instead of incrementing by 5 minutes each time?

Toronto to Curacao January 26 2014 return February 2 2014. Both flights on time. Staff polite and smiley. Leather seats - I prefer fabric. Very long wait for luggage both ways. Minimal food.

Only flight was delayed leaving Winnipeg January 25 to Cancun - offered no explanations only a $15 breakfast voucher for a 5 hour delay. On the way back our flight again the only one in the airport that kept getting delayed and delayed and delayed with no explanations. Scheduled to leave Cancun at 11.35 left at 1.30. Staff were extremely rude and not approachable. Couldn't even get a glass of water because she was too busy with other things. Not an enjoyable experience with Sunwing at all. I will not recommend them.

First time trip to Cuba possibly last time trip with Sunwing by the looks of it. Drove 1.5 hr to Wpg and arrived at 3.30pm. Originally scheduled for 6pm departure we found out it would be 8.15pm. Check-in was good young lady pleasant. We were given a $10 voucher ($5 each) for the purchase of anything in the airport because of the delay. We were then made aware we would now be delayed to midnight. People now arriving later (around 10.30pm) rec'd vouchers for $60! Pays to come later I guess. The flight attendants seemed tired but tried their best to make a bad situation a bit better. We finally arrived to our resort at 0830 and so our first day there was not a great one. Our flight back was delayed only 1/2 hr and went very well. The flight attendants were very good to excellent!

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
We flew out of Toronto on January 22nd flying to Cancun Mexico for a wedding. We had 4 different flights across Canada going to the same place. None of these were on time. We not only sat around for an hour with delays going down to Mexico but they boarded everyone on the plane just to pull us off again and make us wait for at least another 45 minutes. We were to leave at 10.30 and did not take off until closer to 1. On the way back to Canada not only did they switch gates on us but they were once again late. The crew not bothering to show up for an extra 45 minutes and then delays after that. Also once again had to sit on the plane for around an hour. The food on the way down was stale and not edible. The screen did not pop down and the audio for the movie was too much static for anyone to bother watching it. The staff were pleasant enough but nowhere near enough to make up for the horrible service we got throughout the rest of the flight.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
Booked a trip through Sunwing going from Edmonton to Ixtapa because it was supposed to be a direct flight this year. A couple of weeks before we were to leave we were told that we had to stop in Calgary. We were not too happy with this because we had to depart Edmonton an hour and a half earlier. What could we do at this point. The flight was just about an hour late leaving Edmonton. Once we landed in Calgary they had to do a crew change and then there were issues with the paperwork. About an hour delay again. Arrived in Ixtapa about 40 minutes later than was previously scheduled. Coming home we left the hotel at about 1.20 pm and didn't fly out from Ixtapa until 6 pm. The flight was scheduled to leave at 5.20 pm. Delays again because of paperwork. Late getting into Edmonton again also because of crew change issues in Calgary. We have flown Sunwing many times in the past but this is the first time we have had any issues. The resort we stayed at was excellent and would definitely go back again but worried at what the Sunwing flight will be like next time.

Flew out January 9th - 23rd to Cabo. Our plane was late arriving and late departing. We spent two weeks in Cabo and spoke to many Canadians flying in from Vancouver Calgary etc. There was not one person we spoke to flying with Sunwing that was on time. We will never fly Sunwing again and would never recommend this airline. The resort and town was fantastic and I would go back to Cabo again but not via Sunwing.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
We were supposed to leave Regina at 7.30 am on January 9th 2013. We were told that the plane was too heavy although it was not full and that the runway was too short. We finally left at 9.30 am. When we stopped in the Dominican we were first told we could stay on board and so could our luggage. 10 minutes later they had changed their mind and we had to deplane with our luggage and go through security again. We had a 10 hour day on our way to Cayo Coco. The return trip was also late leaving Cuba. The seats are uncomfortable the food unacceptable and the service non-existent. Cayo Coco is beautiful and I would go again. Sunwing is a terrible airline and I would never recommend flying with them to anyone. It would be faster to fly to Calgary or Winnipeg and then on to your destination with a reliable airline.

Vacation with Sunwing in Dec 9 2013 to Cancun. On the way back after 2 hour delay we were finally on board. When everybody was on board we were told we will fly to Winnipeg because the crew will be working over 15 hours if we flew to Vancouver as scheduled. The delay was over 10 hours. We didn't even have enough food and water on the plane. Contacted Sunwing customer service after about a month's time was told it was because of "technical problem" so they will not be responsible.

Left Saskatoon Jan 16th on time. Service not good - "box pizza" not good asked for coffee announced drinks would be served but never came around. Asked later for beer or drinks but said - do you really want one we'll be there in an hour or so. On return flight Jan 23 - same food no drinks. Asked for coffee twice then got one asked for beer but the alcohol compartment was locked up and they didn't have the key. Landed in Regina waited 2 hours because one engine had oil leaking no service at all. Got the feeling that staff don't care for their job. After reading some reviews ours wasn't as bad but I don't recommend Sunwing.

Before I went to the airport I checked my Sunwing flight online and it was supposed to be on time. All other flights were on time but flight WG622 to Cuba on January 16.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
Our vacation was for Jan 13-20/2014. After booking a vacation with a direct flight to Cancun I was emailed a few days later to say we were re-routed and would be stopping in Holguin Cuba. If that wasn't bad enough the day we were leaving our flight was delayed 5 hours and with the stop over in Cuba we didn't arrive in Cancun until after midnight! The night before we were leaving to go home we found out our flight had been changed again and we were being picked up 11 am and we would be stopping in Cuba again. After over 1.5 hrs in line up to check our luggage the flight still left late and with the stop over in Cuba we didn't arrive into Winnipeg until just after midnight! The Sunwing staff gave no explanations had no empathy with all the very frustrated people and basically didn't really seem to care. I would never fly Sunwing again.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
We had the misfortune of choosing Sunwing for our trip to Santa Maria on January 7th. There were many delays. Some partially due to bad weather others due to mechanical difficulties. We were delayed a total of 25 hrs. The only compensation was a $5 voucher. All the rest of our expenses were totally out of pocket. We spent at least $40 for food and beverages while waiting. Staff was impossible to find and when they were available they were rude at best. We also chose the elite plus package they offered what a money grab that is. Nothing special at all. Would I use Sunwing Airlines again? Without question not. Pay the extra with another airline it will be well worth it.

Constantly delayed no explanations and horrible service. Will never fly with this company again. Was to leave at 8.45 am on January 17 2014. System was down stood in line for an hour and a half finally boarded two hours late. When we arrived in Regina they had booked the people in seats that were already taken. On the day we were to leave January 24 2014 we went to check out and our plane was delayed 4.5 hours with no explanation. They ran out of sandwiches by the time they got to us they gave us this horrible pizza that was hard as a rock and stuck to the bottom of the cardboard. When we arrived back in Regina we finally landed at 12.00 am and sat on the tarmac for an hour and a half. We finally arrived back in Saskatoon at 2.30 am.

Went to Cancun with Sunwing January 2014. When we got to the YEG airport I have never seen a longer queue to check in. Took almost an hour to check in which is the longest it's ever taken me. I have flown many times with other airlines and never has it taken that long. Once we got to the desk the lady working was not very helpful and was rude not a good start to our vacation. Wouldn't let us have a carry on because it was too big. Same carry on we use with other airlines and it's never been a problem. The service on the plane was good and they give you a glass of champagne once you take off which I thought was nice. The food was good as well. On the way back our plane had to stop for gas so that delayed things by an hour and a half which no one was impressed by delays are understandable when flying however. I hope they come up with a faster system if I choose to fly Sunwing again.

Our trip from Toronto to Veradero Cuba 16-23 Jan 2014. We checked to see if our flight for 3.30pm was on time and it was we left Cambridge got to the park and fly and lined up to check our baggage by 1pm the attendant told us that our flight was delayed 6 hrs. There were no Sunwing reps to tell anyone the reasons why so we walked around the airport for 7hrs. We decided at 8 pm to go through customs got to the Sunwing boarding area and were told by others there that it will be another 1.5 hrs before we board. When we were to come back to Canada the flight was delayed 2 hrs nothing from Sunwing to apologize. I will from now on spend a little more money and get better service with another airline.

Our flight going to Montego Bay Jamaica was delayed 24 hours before our flight was to leave. Our flight was to leave Saturday January 18th at 10.20am. By looking at YYZ flight delays it just stated delayed. Meaning you had to show up because passengers did not now for how long the delay would be. Upon arrival we found out that the flight was delayed until 5.30pm. There was not one person on site who could represent Sunwing. After a small crowd of us had gathered a representative did show up. We stood for over a half hour waiting on some type of decision. Some passengers were offered meal vouchers some a day pass to the Sheraton some limo rides to and from home others were offered nothing. We waited at the airport all day and then decided to go check to see if there were any new changes with the plane around 3.30 pm. There were none so we did our pre-boarding so that we could get our boarding passes. At about 4.00pm we went to check our luggage only to learn that the flight was once again delayed until 6.30 pm. More meal vouchers and wait time. By the time we got to the gate and waited to board it was 7.00pm. As we were boarding each passenger was handed a voucher for $75.00 for future travel. We did eventually arrive at 11.55pm in Montego Bay and arrived at our hotel room at 1.45am. Will never recommend or use again.

We traveled from Edmonton to Cancun January 15th-25th. Flight to Cancun was on time in fact arrived 45 mins early. Flight home was delayed 2 hours then ended up being 4 hours late. We paid and booked for Elite plus which gave us extra leg room and extra weight for luggage and thought we could also go to the VIP lounge. VIP lounge was not included for $80. Extra leg room was nice but the seat was so uncomfortable our seats did not recline. The food they served was the same as on the way there. Pizza which was barely warm or a smoked meat sandwich and a piece of marble cake. All in all we heard many complaints about Sunwing doubt very much we will use Sunwing again.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
Flew from Regina to Puerto Vallarta on Sunwing. Supposed to leave at 10.20 am Sunday January 12th actually left 1.30 am Monday January 13th 15 hours late. No explanation given but we now know that our plane was given to the Veradero group which had been already delayed 15 hours for reasons unknown. Something to do with freezing rain which didn't affect any other airlines only Sunwing. So our vacation was messed up because of problems with another plane and we lost over half a day. We were each given a $150 voucher to be used on a future Sunwing excursion but there are conditions on it that make it worthless. If you have the chance to fly Sunwing don't do it.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
Flew to Punta Cana from Montreal on January 10th. Flight was delayed approximately 9 hours. We were on the runway reading to take off plane takes off when there was a problem with the engine. We had to wait for another Sunwing plane to come in. Got to the hotel at 3am and missed out on our first evening. The return flight to Montreal on January 17th was also delayed approximately 9 hours. Thankfully we found out while we were still at the hotel so we were able to enjoy our day in the sun and enjoy a last dinner. Nevertheless we were told that the delay was caused due to engine problems again! Never again Sunwing!

One of the worst travel experiences we have ever had. We flew from Vancouver to Santa Clara January 7-21. Delays rude staff no reps to help. Seriously pay the extra money and fly with a reliable airline who actually cares about customers.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
15 hour delay in Regina Airport. Flight was supposed to leave at 7.45pm delayed to 9pm then 11pm then 2 am then at 2.30 am they announce that it would be delayed until 10 am but to be at the airport at 7 am. They stated they would pay for hotel rooms and taxi. Another hour wasted waiting in line to be told what hotel and waiting for taxi service. At the hotel the manager tells the crowd that Sunwing has no account with the hotel so we waited for taxi to go back to airport it was now 4.30 in the morning so we slept in the airport. 10 am rolls along and we are told our flight is leaving on time but will have to go to Toronto instead of a direct flight to Varadero. I understand delays and weather conditions but this was over the top. Spend the extra and fly with a more reputable company.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
We had a 16 hour delay! We were supposed to leave Regina at 7pm on January 11th. We were delayed again and again claimed the runway was too icy but all other planes were coming and going. They finally sent us home at 3 am. We were to return on January 12 at 8 am and we left at 11 am for Toronto if you can believe it. They claimed they needed to refuel. Finally made it to Varadero Cuba on Sunday night at 8 pm we had lost one full day and night and received nothing for it. Our resort was very nice the people were wonderful and I would go there again just not through Sunwing.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
We travelled to Cuba from January 2-11 2014 on Sunwing. We have travelled before with Air Canada Vacations WestJet without any issues so were expecting similar service not so - the flights with Sunwing were a nightmare! On our way back home we were told while waiting in line to check-in that the flight was delayed by 3 hours because "of bad weather in Canada so it's not our fault". Turns out it was 2 degrees in Toronto with no snow or winter weather warnings. The issue as it turned out was a check-in system failure. They did not offer any apologies refreshments or even worse any explanation. Every person we spoke to at the resort kept telling us their flights were delayed and some people were told after they had checked out of their rooms. Then when we returned to Toronto I saw on the news that passengers had to wait 20 hours at the Varadero airport. Seriously Sunwing if one flight is delayed we may understand but when almost all your flights have problems - then the issue is most definitely you.

We went to Jamaica from Jan 2 to Jan 9th our flight down was supposed to be a champagne flight. It was not for a 6.5 hour flight our hot meal was a turkey and egg sandwich. Our flight back was delayed 12 hours so we waited at the resort for 12 hours from our check out time until they finally gave us another room so we could sleep for 5 hours before catching our flight home. It was common knowledge that the airport would be closed from midnight to 6 am. Our trip back we were served marble cake and a bag of chips with a voucher for 150$ off our next trip with Sunwing. We will not book another trip through Sunwing again.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
My wife and I travelled to Varadero Cuba from Jan 9th to the 16th 2014. Thursday January 9th was the tail end of the big ice freeze in Ontario so we anticipated a delayed flight to Varadero but not one as long as 5 hours. We never did find out the reason for the delay but Sunwing seems to use the excuse of 'mechanical difficulties' as their default. Had a great time in Cuba but were confronted by another delay on our return home. Once again that blasted excuse of 'mechanical difficulties' was used to try to placate the passengers and once again the delay was approximately 5.5 hours. I'm beginning to think that Sunwing overbooks passengers then delays flights to accommodate those passengers. Sunwing will not take our money for another vacation. We will use another airline from this day forward.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
3.5 hrs late leaving. No paperwork no ground crew no water lots of excuses. Finally ready to go and we see the captain loading our luggage. The bridge was stuck to the plane - it only took 3 crews and another 1/2 hr to figure that one out we were 2nd class citizens on a 3rd class airline. Inflight "entertainment" was had poor sound and lousy picture. They also never cleaned the plane properly - the little former ashtrays in the seat armrests were full of garbage dirty kleenexes etc. Never again.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
Paid for elite plus seats on direct return flights from Vancouver to Huatulco Mexico (Jan 7-14 2014). Eight days before departure we are moved to non-direct flights in economy seats. Lost countless holiday hours. Plane was dirty some seats double-booked. Service onboard was mediocre but nothing compared to the horror show on the way home. Elite Plus check-in had no attendant. When one finally arrived service was pitiful. Made it to front of line only to overhear my seats were double-booked. 5 hours into flight still no beverage service (ie nothing). Extremely unprofessional flight crew. Landed in Calgary two hours late to drop off passengers. New flight crew boards. Surely service would be better on this last leg of the trip. No! Rude flight attendants hid behind curtain drinking pop and eating their own dinner. Our seats were in first row so we heard and saw everything. Travellers beware and heed the reviews of past Sunwing passengers the similarities in experiences are staggering.

Flight 683 from Varadero to Toronto. Arrived at airport January 13 at 1730 for flight that was to leave at 2100 only to see our flight had been delayed. We were still sitting in the airport at 2400 with no Sunwing rep or any explanation as to what was happening. At 0200 our group had no water food washrooms and air conditioning had been turned off. Once a Sunwing rep arrived he tried to tell us that the Canadian end did not let them know in Cuba what was happening. He was trying to get buses organized to take us back to a hotel. At 0630 we boarded buses to go back to a hotel to freshen up and have breakfast. When we arrived they herded us into a large room and one person sat in the hotel passing us our room keys. At 0830 we finally were in our rooms. At 1200 we were bussed back to the airport for a flight at 1600. This flight was also late in taking off. Flight crew were rude. No Sunwing rep there to greet us upon return or offer us any compensation. Connections were missed.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
This is the worst vacation travel we have ever experienced. We paid extra for pre boarding and seat choice flying from Thunder Bay to Varadero. The departure was OK. The return flight was not. There were no Sunwing representatives at the airport. The flight was delayed several hours. No one to tell us what was going on. When representatives finally showed up they directed passengers to the wrong gate. It was a stampede to the gate area no regard for the pre-boarding we had paid for. Flight attendants were rude. We will never take a Sunwing vacation again no matter how low the price.

Flew Sunwing flight 363 from Cayo Santa Maria to Ottawa. We were left stranded in the Hotel Lobby on our departure day January 6th up until 11pm. They then put us up for the night. Checked out the next day only to be left there again until 10pm where they decided to ship us off to the airport with no scheduled flight just to get rid of us at the hotel. They kept us waiting at the counters for 2 hours before they opened for Ottawa. I had paid for Elite plus with pre selected seats and had to wait another hour in line and fight to get my seats. Once across they told us to line up at the gate only to be told by the pilot that we was over his flight time therefore would be back in 12 hours. We remained trapped in the Cuban airport with no food! They finally served us a disgusting sandwich which we had to line up for after they served the Toronto people who had just arrived to the airport! We had been waiting there since the night before! They served the same thing on the flight back. It was supposed to be a champagne flight! We got the same sandwich a glass of water and a cuban juice box. The pilot's first words on the plane were: Anyone that causes problems during this flight will be dropped off at the next airport!

Sunwwing Holiday of Horrors! While I waited 28 hours (Jan 7-82014) mostly at the airport in Ottawa horror stories began to be exchanged. No representation anywhere to be found no information given to any passengers for these outrageous delays and complete absence of service.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
The first and last time on Sunwing. I checked the flight departure time before leaving for the airport at 3.30 am. It showed that flight was on time but when I arrived at the airport the flight information screen showed that our flight was 3.5 hours delayed from 6 am to 9.30 am. We went to the check in counter and the staff had no idea that our flight was delayed. Airport staff were so unprofessional and unfriendly. The reason for the flight was that cabin crew needed more rest. At 8.30 they made another announcement to inform us that that flight was delayed again to 10.30 am but retracted the delay half an hour later and put it back to 9.30 am. Flight attendants looked very tired and were unfriendly. Our return flight was even worse. We boarded the plane on time but as soon as we reached the runway pilot announced that they had to bring the aircraft back to the terminal because there was an engine problem. They didn't let us off the plane and brought mechanics to fix the problem which took over 2 hours. Never flying Sunwing airlines again.

Travelled to Riviera Nayarit from Dec 29-Jan 5. Departure flight delayed 2.5 hrs but the update online is too late was already stuck at the airport. For return flight I checked with Sunwing reps at hotel many times of the morning we suppose to leave still said on time until noon that day however when we get to airport at 1pm we learnt that flight was delayed 2.5 hrs. The airline must have know that the incoming flight was delayed at the other end. After waiting 5 hrs at the assigned gate 17 suddenly sign on the screen is gone no announcement nothing communicated until one of passenger asked the rep at the gate she learnt that the gate was changed to 14 instead of 17. Another hour passed by still no update no info and suddenly we see all the run around from the flight crew to pilot to the reps and flight is cancelled. Now we have to wait another hour to take luggage back out another 2 hrs to check in at a dirty hotel for the night. The next afternoon we had to line up to check luggage back in re-issue another boarding pass and the system doesn't know that our flight has been cancelled so none of us can get any pass another 2 hrs in line for nothing until they have to write boarding pass by hand! Beware of Sunwing!

Flew to Cayo Santa Marie from Sudbury for New Years Eve December 2013 via Ottawa. Return trip was an absolute nightmare. Flight 363 returning on January 6th to Sudbury was delayed 48 hours. No representation from Sunwing at resort and they completely forgot about us in Cuba. Finally when getting through security at the airport crew had to rest for an additional 12 hours. No food on board. Lack of communication was unbearable. Came back 2 days late. Will never fly Sunwing again.

Flight WG514 on Jan 8 2014. Delayed 8 hours then we were stuck on the plane for 3 hours prior to take off. Airline attendants would not help anyone. They were very unprofessional. Then when we landed we were stuck on the plane for another hour. They wouldn't let anyone use the bathroom while were stuck sitting there. No one at the luggage area to tell people what was going on. Didn't give out forms in line so prolonged the line as people were standing at the desk filling out form instead of doing it ahead of time. Then our luggage didn't arrive. When we finally got a hold of someone they said we would get our luggage on Sat or Sunday but it never came.

Bought a vacation package with direct flights from Edmonton to Los Cabos Mexico. Flight down was fine however flight back was a nightmare. When we arrived at the airport the flight was delayed and the Premium Package we paid for was really nothing different then Economy service. They nailed us on luggage overcharge and even carryon bag with total charge of $ 280. They said it had to be paid in cash stating their debit/credit card machine was down I said I wanted to upgrade to Elite Package as I was only slightly over in the luggage weight and they said they needed 24 hour notice of the upgrade. Since I couldn't pay using a credit card and there wasn't a debit machine around they told me and my wife to give them all my available cash which was $200 and they put through our luggage. Once we boarded the plane which was late one female flight attendant was rude and unprofessional. We wanted to purchase items from the inflight duty free catalogue however they did not have the items they were advertising. The plane was dirty from the previous flight and the leather seats had old food stuck to the seats. My wife and I will never fly with Sunwing Airlines again as it was the worst flight experience for us and we travel extensively.

Bought a vacation package with direct flights from Ottawa to Cancun. Flight was leaving Ottawa at 6am to arrive at Cancun at 9.30am and leaving Cancun at 8pm to arrive in Ottawa at 1am. Both flights were changed several times to end up as a totally different package. Outbound flight ended up leaving Ottawa at 9am with a stop in Kitchener to arrive in Cancun at 2pm. The return flight ended up leaving Cancun at 3pm with a stop in Kitchener to arrive in Ottawa at 9.30pm. As for delays the outbound flight was delayed 3 hours for no apparent reason and we arrived in Cancun at 5pm (instead of 2pm). Return flight was delayed 29 hours to arrive in Ottawa at 3.30am 2 days later than expected. The various Sunwing reps. were unable to keep us informed as they did not know what was going on we were informing them by checking airport departures changes every hour or so! People from Kitchener indicated that Sunwing adds a stop to Kitchener every year after enough seats are sold from Ottawa. For the outbound flight # 579 on Dec 23 the 4 crew members were extremely rude with everybody food was literally thrown on peoples table without any drinks or towels. For the return flight # 580 on Jan. 7 (but scheduled on Jan. 6) the 4 crew members were very friendly. These Sunwing flights did not serve meals: they gave a cold sandwich and thats it with 1 drink about 1 hour before you get your sandwich. Avoid Rows 14 and 15 (Elite +) as these seats do not recline because of the emergency exits.

I flew Sunwing as part of a VacationExpress.com deal from Cincinnati to Punta Cana in October of 2013 and had a wonderful flight. The plane was clean and roomy. They served us snacks a full meal drinks and champagne. We got bumped up to "first class" on the way there which was nice. We got 1 free bag and carry on per person which was nice. We didn't get charged any extra fees and check in was fast and easy. Our flight attendants were very nice and helpful and we watched a movie that was still playing in theatres! I recommend getting a seat close to the front of the plane and don't pay extra for "first class". We got bumped up to "first class" which was no different than coach other than the extra leg room it is not separated and you don't get any additional perks.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
Definitely the last time travelling with Sunwing. Initially booked trip had us leaving on Dec 28 at 1945 hrs. Woke up that day to several notifications that flight had changed to 2300/2100/2200 and finally 2300. The kicker was receiving the text at noon that our flight was on schedule at 2300 hrs. Arrived at airport to be told weather was the reason for delay. Flight changed from 2300 to 2345. Finally left at 0110 hrs. Flight staff cheerfully turned lights on and made constant announcements while everyone was trying to sleep. Got to our resort at 0900 hrs. On last day we were advised check out at 1400 for our flight at 0235. Arrived at the airport at midnight to be told that our flight was delayed until 0510 hrs. Plane finally arrived at 0500 lined up and told flight cancelled due to mechanical difficulties until further notice. Finally on the plane at 0615 for a very uncomfortable flight. Staff were rude and unaccommodating. I was not impressed with the lukewarm glass of cheap champagne nor the food. We had trouble with them four years ago and now.

Flew Sunwing out of Calgary to Cuba on Dec 24/2013. Arrived at airport 5am for 7am flight to be told that the flight was delayed 2 hours due to "crew rest". Get on plane at 9am only to have to evacuate due to mechanical failure. Plane had to be hauled away for inspection hauled away with our luggage on board. Each hour that passed no updates. Finally told that they had to get a new plane. More time passes with no announcements. Finally hear after several hours that they are getting a plane in Saskatoon out of the hangar they will get the Saskatoon passengers and bring them to Calgary so we can all just fly out of Calgary to Cuba. Plane finally arrives but sits at gate nobody getting off. Advised of crew change. More hours pass. Advised that there is a "catering issue beyond our control". More time passes. Finally get on the plane Saskatoon passengers have been suck on the plane for 2 hours without any service only warm water not allowed to deplane. Get on plane advised no audio/visual sorry (terrific for the 5.5 hour flight ahead). Lunch consisted of a bad slice of re-heated pizza in tin foil. We had upgraded to Elite Plus. Seats did not recline and the "champagne service" consisted of a tiny sample cup glass of bad champagne. All in we were 12 hours in Calgary airport. During this ridiculous delay Sunwing handed out $5.00 lunch vouchers which doesn't even buy you barely a coffee. Once on the plane they handed out $75.00 vouchers for your next Sunwing flight. Nobody was bothering taking these vouchers. We were scheduled to arrive into Cuba Dec 24 at 4:30 p.m. instead after the 12 hour delay and a 90 minute bus ride we ended up arriving to the resort at 3am! Ridiculous and horrible service and airline. Never again.

Vancouver to Varadero. Flight supposed to leave at 6.30 pm. Upon arrival at airport found out there was a planned 4 hr delay. They gave out $5 vouchers. Finally go to departure gate and it was announced that there was another 4 hour delay. Flight took off 7.5 hours late departing at 1 am. Return trip was worse. Resort kicked us out of rooms at 12 noon even though flight didn't leave until 4 am. Bus picks us up at 1 am arrive at airport approx. 2.30 am find that flight delayed approx. 1.5 hrs now supposed to be there at 6 am. At approx. 5 am we are told that the incoming flight has landed in Havana instead of Veradero due to fog. At 11 am flight finally arrives. Then find out that Pearson is closed due to bad weather. Missed another whole night of sleep arrived back at home absolutely exhausted and stressed out.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
Never take Sunwing unless you don't mind your flight being constantly delayed (both ways). We left for Vegas on 29th flight got delayed for more than an hour. On our return trip our flight was once again delayed an hour. As I type this we are once again waiting for our luggage to load onto the conveyor belt. It's been an hour already with no explanation as to why our luggage is being held back! Our arrival time should be 4.10 but it is now 6.30pm and we are still waiting for luggage. Customer service on Sunwing is very poor. We encountered very rude check-in staff and rude careless flight attendants.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
Will never book with Sunwing again due to horrendous track record. Waiting for flight back to YVR from Cabos right now which is 5 hours delayed. The flight there was delayed by 5 hours as well. How's that for consistently bad execution? No weather or other understandable reason for these delays is known.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
Jan 6th. Left our Condo at 8am for our 10.30 flight to Toronto after confirming online that the flight was on time. On arrival at St Petersburg airport the monitor showed on time so returned our rental car. When we got to the desk we were told the flight had not left Toronto yet and the new flight time would be at 1pm. There was no explanation as to why the website nor the airport monitors were not updated no explanation of why we were not alerted by email. We rented another car for a few hours and are now back at our condo. It is just poor customer service not to keep people informed and have them sitting in an airport for 5 hours. Delays are inevitable especially with the weather conditions in Toronto. A flight delay is one thing but Sunwings very poor communication is another.

My first and last time with Sunwings. The delays are terrible. The flight from Toronto to Vancouver on Dec 20th 2013 delayed almost 3 hours. My return flight on Jan 4 2014 most likely will be another 3 hours late.

Flight delays but expected on Dec 22nd. Return flight delays out of Punta Cana Dom. Rep. not announced to Sunwing passengers (Dec. 29th). Good thing we kept an eye on things otherwise we would have missed our flight home. Sunwing staff was polite pilot and co-pilot gave us lots of updates the food (sandwiches) were quite good and they were quick to clean up after meals and snacks.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
Paid for Elite Plus did not get checked-in or boarded any sooner than regular economy. I questioned the employees in both Hamilton and Cuba and no one cared just walked away. Service was terrible on the way there. For some reason the staff did not know what was being served there was a lot of confusion as one staff walked up and down the aisles for about half hour but didn't distribute them and no one advised of any delays so we sat there frustrated and hungry. In Cuba when I tried boarding I was yelled at in front of everyone by a staff member because he said I was supposed to board first and I said I didn't hear anything as it was utter chaos once we got through customs there was no organization direction or signs and it was very loud. He then started arguing with me and I had to ask him to give me my boarding pass back to get onto the plane.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
Our family vacations a lot and I used to travel significantly during 30 years in business. I have never had Flight from Saskatoon to Punta Cana was delayed 5 hours. On the return flight the departure from Punta Cana was delayed 2 hours. On the scheduled stop over in Cayo Coco there was a mechanical problem after sitting on the runway for 2 hours we were deplaned and told that the plane needed to return to Toronto. The entire plane load of people was abandoned in Cayo Coca with no information provided on what was going on. After two hours of waiting in the airport we were informed that a new plane was being sent from Toronto and the flight we would rescheduled to 10.30 the following morning. They did transport us to and paid for accommodation at a local hotel for the night. The next morning everyone was at the airport ready to go at 9.00 only to be told the flight was delayed until noon. Flight finally took off at 1.00. To top it all off we had to wait an hour for our bags to be unloaded back in Saskatoon. I have been on hundreds of flights and 20 years of winter vacations and this is by far the worst airline experience I have ever had.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
Our family vacations a lot and I used to travel significantly during 30 years in business. I have never had flights delayed anywhere near 12 hours while on business and yet with Sunwing it's happened twice first to Puerto Vallarta and then on December 21 to Punta Cana. We had booked a 6.30am departure which eventually left around 9.00pm. We were given a $15 food voucher and $75 travel voucher (for the Puerto Vallarta trip the travel voucher was $150). It was particularly exasperating that we were not informed of reasons why this happened. There are multiple strategies airlines may employ in order to maximize yield and passenger revenue miles. One of these is overbooking. With this strategy passengers were asked to voluntarily deplane and those not wishing to do so were not inconvenienced. To my surprise there was always a rush to receive the two free tickets to anywhere the airline flew. It appears the Sunwing strategy is to wait until all seats are filled and while this is good for Sunwing shareholders in the short term it is not good for the long term for Sunwing or its hotel partner. I would love to have another carrier but they have a lock on our favourite destinations and resort hosts. I'm not looking forward to our January 31 flight to the Mayan Riviera already booked.

Ottawa to Cancun Dec 21. The flight was late both ways by 3 hours. 5 kg carry-on rule the carry-on alone weighs 4 kg. Worst sandwich I have ever had. The plane was filled with families for Christmas and they played a very violent movie. Paid 160 dollars for so called elite seats that could not even recline. A 4 hour flight and we got one warm coke serving to drink had to ask for ice that she was hiding in her cart. Never again.

My daughter flew with Sunwing return  Vancouver to Toronto. Flights were delayed in both directions so they would leave after midnight. I have been advised this is done intentionally to pay lower airport departure fees. We flew with Sunwing a number of years ago and they were doing the same thing.

We booked a trip to Mexico from Edmonton and it started ok delayed at the airport 2 hrs but I can live with that. On the return flight we were asked to check with are rep before heading to the airport so we wouldn't waste any time so we did and everything was good to go so they said. We arrived at the airport 3 hrs early then were told there was a delay. It was supposed to leave at 4.45 then 9.45 then 3.00. Finally at 3.45 we were on the runway after spending 13 hrs in a Mexican airport where everything closed at 11pm.

22nd Dec. Huge Ice storm delaying operations out of Toronto Pearson airport. Any other airline had delay information posted on the screen and vouchers for passengers to purchase food inside the terminal. Sunwing had nothing the agents knew nothing. Flying on 513 to Cancun. We find out after 2 hours of sitting on the aircraft that we had been offloaded and our suitcase was not onboard. I inquired to the agent about my luggage if they could load it on since we had 2 more hrs to wait they said yes and I was reassured that it had been placed back on. Passengers had been waiting for more than 4hrs with not one drinks service. I had to tell the crew to turn the lights from bright to low. Since it was a new 737-800 the CSM had no clue how to operate the system. Sandwiches shouldn't of been served after such a long delay. They were soggy cold and the paper was stuck to them. Arrive at destination no luggage. Return flight same thing delay 2hrs no APU closed door stuffy cabin with a more pro- active crew that instantly did a water service. I would rather pay the 100$ more to fly any other airline. Landed in Toronto to be parked at a bridge that did not work.

Went to Punta Cana recently with Sunwing. We sat on the plane while it took forever for it to finally start moving and take off. Got to our resort and it was terrible. Sunwing reps didn't seem to know much about anything. Flight attendants were extremely rude the worst I have come across. Inflight entertainment consisted of a low budget movie which nobody had ever heard of. Flight was delayed on the way out of Punta Cana however the airline never let anyone know and everyone was panicked and scrambling to find out what was going on. When it was finally time to board they didn't even announce it. Could have easily missed our flight if we weren't paying extra attention.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
We booked a trip to Cancun on Sunwing. The flight down to Cancun was delayed almost an hour - nobody was informed until 30 minutes past our scheduled departure time. The inflight TVs didn't work at all the flight attendants made every request seem like the most difficult task and worst of all after travelling all night we arrived at the resort at 5am only to find that nobody had reservations at the resort until the following day. On return it was the same delay scenario. One hour late with no mention of it no apology nothing. Like it never happened. Also ensure your bags are underweight or you will get charged for as little as 0.5kg over weight. They weigh every article you have including my small inflatable pillow. I would never fly Sunwing again. In my opinion it is worth whatever it costs to maximize the precious minutes of your already short vacation. Sunwing wasted many minutes of our trip and caused more stress than they should. They do feed you for free and the food is actually not all that bad. Otherwise I have nothing good to say.

attendants. As with most charter flights the seats are a little closer together but all in all the flight was comfortable. We were met by Sungwing reps to be bussed to our resort. The tour guide was informative and advised us about many things we would need to know while in Cuba.

Booked from Ottawa to MBJ direct 29 Nov - 6 Dec 06.00 depart and 11.30 Return. Well this was all changed 2 days before changed to 09.00 with a stop in Varadero and return 14.30 with stop again in Varadero then delayed to 15.00. I flown with them the last 2 years with no problems so I was surprised by this. We book early flights to have that extra day in the sun. Anyway terrible service both ways will not book with them again.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
I would not recommend flying with Sunwing. I would suggest spending the extra $100 and fly with another airline. The flight from Edmonton to Huatulco was initially direct. They changed it one week prior to detour to Winnipeg. There was a mechanical problem another detoured to Calgary for a "quick" plane change 2 hours later. Then the Winnipeg for a "quick" pick up 2 hours later. We didn't even leave Canadian airspace by the time the original arrival in Mexico at 5 pm. I can appreciate there maybe mechanical issues or a change in itinerary for financial reasons but it's how Sunwing didn't handle these situations. There was plenty of apologies but not other compensation like upgrade in food being served free cocktails and snack. The hotel and hotel staff were fantastic it's the airline where the problems lie.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
Sunwing has really raised the bar for airline service incompetence. Our most recent trip from Sudbury to Santa Clara Cuba was a testament to their inadequacy. We have flown Sunwing 8 times. I can understand weather delays so the flight being behind schedule wasn't a major deal. Forgetting to have the proper forms to fill out to enter Cuba on board that was a problem! The flight was already 2 hours late but upon landing in Cuba we had to sit for another 30 minutes while we waited for and filled out the visas to enter the country. Food: We had a choice of a questionable sandwich or a piece of cardboard pawned off as pizza. They used to offer a tray meal that was far better than this recent garbage. Departure from the terminal in Santa Clara was a catastrophe waiting to happen. Instead of an orderly boarding it was announced that the flight was ready to board. It was a free for all. The departure door was bombarded with people jostling for position. Our flight home required a trip through Customs in Ottawa and a re-boarding on the same plane to complete the journey to Sudbury. Approximately 40 people were heading for that final destination. After passing through Customs we were required to re-check our luggage and get new boarding passes. So forty people boarding and an intelligent guess would place the luggage total at about forty bags. Why then did only 20 of those bags get put back on the plane? That brings us to our arrival in Sudbury. After the connecting flight with the offer of a glass of water we were greeted with no luggage! We were prepared to drive to our home town in the morning but the Sunwing rep assured us that our luggage would be shipped on the first flight out of Ottawa the next morning. We decided to wait for the luggage in Sudbury. Our luggage didn't arrive until 2.30pm the next day! We will avoid Sunwing in the future.

Paid extra for premium seats on my honeymoon. Flight was delayed four hours due to mechanical problem. On my return flight from Cuba was separated from my wife and bumped to a regular seat. When I inquired I was told airline staff gets the premium seats. At least 8 staff members were flying to Toronto. Was offered no compensation and was told to use another airline in the future.

Nov 26th flight 609 to Cayo Coco Cuba. We booked and paid for a direct flight to Cuba only to be notified later that the flight had changed and we would be going to Dominican Rep first. At Ottawa airport we could not get our boarding passes from the kiosk and had to line up at which time we were told they were overbooked by 6. This was not true as they had decided to fly a crew of 6 to Cuba and simply bumped the last 6 to board sending them to Montreal to fly to Cuba. Our flight was delayed in Ottawa 1.5hrs then 1 hour in Dominican and 2 more hours to get to Cuba. The food was horrible and wine was in a box. I purchased a bottle of Bailey's at $24 and paid $25 cash only to be told they did not have any change. Delays again on the way back and bad food. We will never fly Sunwing again.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
Booked a direct flight from Ottawa leaving for Cuba 9am. We left Ottawa at 11am flew to Punta Cana and then to Cuba a 3hr 45 min flight took over 7 hrs. Coming back were to leave Cuba at 5.10pm and arrive around 9pm. We finally left at 8.30pm and arrived home at 12am. Reason: well of course Sunwing first went to the Dominican Republic took on passengers and then made them get off the plane in Cuba then re-board the same plane. They then kindly let us board the plane and made us change seats 3 times because of course they had already double booked our seats. This flight was filled with tired frustrated and very angry travellers. I travel to Cuba and the Dominican Republic several times every winter and this is my third bad experience with Sunwing and my last. I lost almost 2 days vacation and came back frustrated and angry.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
Booked a trip to Varadero with Sunwing first week of April 2013. Direct flight from Halifax to Varadero but my luggage was sent to Toronto only passenger on flight to have this happen! Worked with Sunwing rep at Varadero resort to find luggage but soon found out that they were more interested in tour bookings than finding my luggage. As a result my luggage was gone for 6 days of my vacation and it had returned to the Varadero airport 4 days later. This company has no credibility and I would advise for all to avoid. Sure if you are the 90% who have no problems as you should this airline is great; but have problems and they will put the responsibility on you to resolve.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
Travelled on WG608 to Cayo Coco via Punta Cana - total 7.5 hr flight along with a 1.5 hour delayed departure from Ottawa. Computer problems. Luggage was loaded in wrong order then reloaded. Plane towed from one gate to another due to delays. Champagne offered 1.5 hrs into flight. Followed by no coffee or tea for entire 7.5 hrs. Sandwich offered - no napkin - around mid day and nothing for 4 hours of flight - we were on ground in Punta Cana for around 1 hour then 2 hours flight back north to Cayo Coco. Travelled WG609 to Ottawa from Cayo Coco. Flight delayed by 2 hours then 3 hours - in airport departure lounge for 6 hours - junk food only available - my Elite Plus seat was booked on check in at Cayo Coco airport then as walking out gate Cuban official changed it to a regular seat. My seat had been sold to someone else. No notification prior. Complained to flight crew. Issue resolved on plane and passengers not happy one had the nerve to challenge my right to the seat I had purchased months before over the rights of someone who had bought an upgrade that very day. Food was dreadful. Frozen pizza reheated or sandwich. Ate pizza - had complementary wine. Will never fly Sunwing again. Quality of service has changed significantly from 3 years ago.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
10 days before our trip departure they change both the departure time and the return time. The return non stop turned into a stopover and an additional 4hrs to the flight time. An 8.5 hr flight time for a 4.5hr flight. I would not have booked the trip with such a terrible return flight and of course I was not able to cancel and get a refund. There were no apologies or any answers to my emails. This is the second time I have used Sunwing and they have changed departures 3 times out of 4. I am not retired with lots of time to make changes. I will drive to Buffalo and use an airline from there if the carriers in Toronto can not accommodate me. I will never use Sunwing again.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
I use Sunwing because it is cheap to certain spots so I'm not going to complain about seating or extra charges to pick seats etc they do have the best price on a lot of tours. They need to give their stewardesses some customer service lessons. On the way down Vancouver to Varadaro Nov 22-30 they were feeding us the head stewardess was across our aisle when another stewardess pulled out a boxed pizza to give out the head stewardess said "I thought we were out of them I told a customer we didn't have anymore" then to our unbelief she said to the other stewardess "ahh forget it I wont tell her". Head stewardess just glared back and moved on. On the way back an elderly/not so fit women had a window seat she decided to sit in the aisle seat when the person who owned that seat showed up she didn't want to move the steward had to make her move to her assigned window seat. The plane was only 3/4 full if that. There was an extra 10-12 sunwing cabin crew catching a flight home that were seated in 4 rows at the back of the plane and they requested to sit up front in row 3 and 4 the remaining ones in the back never shut up it was an overnight flight people wanted to sleep. Would I fly Sunwing again I would like to say not likely most unprofessional crew however I probably will if the price is as cheap again.

Booked package to Veradero based on direct flight. One month after paying for flight we were notified the departure flight had moved up forcing us all to take an extra day holiday. They also rerouted us to Montego Bay 1st. We flew over Veradero for an extra three hours sitting in a cramped plane with many children. They gave us no option to cancel or expect compensation. The day before we left we were notified the seats we had prepaid to book were not being honoured and again we had no compensation. We then were notified that our return flight was also being moved up so that we could once again fly to Jamaica adding three hours to our flight. Once off the lane it took 45 minutes to deliver our luggage in the airport and the airport says it is the airline's responsibility to make their 20 minute advertised limit. Do not fly Sunwing! They cost us two days of our holiday.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
We usually fly Sunwing to the Caribbean but after this trip we shall be looking for another airline for our holidays. The flight crews were good my main complaint is with the airline flight operations and reservations. We were told after we had booked our flight down to Cuba (Nov 22 from YOW) that it will be a would be a combined flight (MBJ and VRA) and that on the return trip to Canada the plane would be stopping in MBJ before picking us up at VRA. A couple of days before the flight the return leg was changed and that it would be VRA THEN MBJ giving us 2 seven hour flights. When the flights were combined we called the airline and got nothing but the usual run around and hiding behind their rules even when it was supposedly escalated 4 levels. But the topper was that on the return flight the MBJ passengers had to deplane and become transit passengers and VRA doesn't have a transit lounge. The MBJ were left to their own devices in the terminal causing the MBJ leg of the trip to be delayed by 30 minutes. On the flight down to MBJ from YOW we were delayed at the gate for paperwork which seemed to be a running thing with this particular captain. At MBJ they had to off load some of the VRA luggage to move it to another cargo hold. The captain said it was for weight and balance but a B737 isn't a Cessna 174. Lastly this is one of the TUI Travel PLC's Euro fleet and the in flight entertainment system didn't work properly. ON the YOW to MBJ portion a large number of the screens didn't drop down until the flight attendant crew trainer from the Euro division rebooted the entire system but then we were on the MBJ to VRA leg. Same thing again on the return to Canada.

August 16 2013. Supposed to travel to Punta Cana that day from Cincinnati. We were told there was a slight delay and we would depart an hour later. That hour turned into a 20 hour delay reason being said because someone on the returning flight got very sick and the solution (IV bag) was used on that person and they could not fly us back out until the solution was replaced. They had no other plane to put us on and we would fly out the next morning. Yes they gave us a voucher to use at the airport but by that time everyone had already eaten and also the airport stores were closed. They gave us free hotel rooms near the airport and a shuttle service. Needless to say we arrived in Punta Cana a day later and they did reimburse us for a small amount of the daily room charge.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
On return flight from Toronto to Vancouver both legs were 3 hours late due to 'the aircraft from the Caribbean flight being late'. Myself and other passengers inquired about the 'Champagne flight' as advertised but was told by the attendant that it only on the international flights that champagne is served. Well many of us were mistaken about that. I will not travel Sunwing again and I told them so but I don't think they care enough to respond.

We just came back from a 7 day (Nov 13-20 2013) All Inclusive Trip to Cancun through Sunwing Vacations. Our flight out of Calgary was delayed 3 hours we had been told it was because the captain had called in ill and Sunwing had to fly a new pilot in from Vancouver. The agents at the check in apologized and offered a $5/person voucher - enough to buy a coffee! On our flight back home same issue the flight back was delayed almost 2 hours because again the crew was late. This time we had to ask the Sunwing agents for a voucher but they said sorry this is Mexico we do not offer vouchers. On top of everything else the seats were most uncomfortable mine didn't even recline back and there was no way to change seats because the plane was full. There was hardly any room between seats and most folks end up knocking their knees against the seat in front of them. Sunwing weigh your carry-on bag at check in. If you would like to take advantage of their pre-flight seat assignment (Online) then be prepared to pay $15/person per flight - an additional $60 for the vacation. When checking in at Calgary airport we were the very first people in line at the counter their agent assigned us seats in the row behind our friends. Once we got to the gate an agent paged us to the counter and informed us that our seats had been sold (I assume online) and should not have been assigned to us. I asked how could this happen as “their system” must have created the error. He didn't have an answer apologized and sent us into the bowels of the airplane. We will not fly with Sunwing again.

We flew from Toronto to Montego Bay. Even though our flight was booked only 2 weeks in advance we had three flight changes before departure. First our flight to MoBay was re-routed through Montreal extending our trip to over 7 hours and effectively taking away a vacation day. Second we were supposed to fly back at 9.40pm but our return flight was moved to earlier in the day. Third change came moving our flight to 11.20am with a different flight number effectively cutting another day of our vacation. The trip we originally booked was more expensive but we were supposed to get almost a day and a half more. When I asked for their supposed "price match guarrantee" I was told that the trip I have after the changes is not being sold so I'm not entitled to the "price match". But that trip was not what I booked in a first place.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
Travelled from Toronto to Montego Bay return. We were pleased that our flight departed on-time in both directions but that was the only good part of this airline experience. The plane was very old cramped and filthy. The seats couldn't have been more narrow and there was no leg room at all. If the person in front reclined their seat it was about 10 inches from your face. Don't get fooled by the $40 upgrade option. We paid this to get more leg room to sit in an exit row but our seats didn't recline. This airline boasts that they provide champagne service and food at no extra charge. However the champagne was served in a pill-cup and the microwaved food was barely edible. I hope we never have to travel on this airline again.

We took a family vacation to Varadero Oct 22-29th. Paid for in July. 3 generations should be simple right? 8 adults 4 children. The youngest grandchild was not yet 2 years old but was charged for a seat. She didn't get a seat either direction. So her parents had her on their lap for a 7 hour flight. We have not got a refund a month later. Seriously thinking Sunwing will not be our choice next time going to try WestJet.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
Was a frequent Sunwing passenger until recently. Booked a flight from Toronto to Punta Cana. An additional stop over in Puerta Plata was added. We were required to deplane while the plane was cleaned. Passengers boarded and after 11/2 hours boarded the plane for the trip to Punta Cana. On the return flight the flight crew failed to give a drinks service coffee and tea was not served and the staff were very rude and inattentive to the passengers. Sunwing was once a great airline but unfortunately things change sometimes for the worse. My wife and I will no longer book a Sunwing flight. Sad but true.

Toronto to St.John's NFLD. We were scheduled to leave at 6:15am  upon arrival at the Toronto Airport we found out our flight was going to be delayed 8 hours until 3pm and still did not get out until 4pm. we arrived in St. John's at 10:30 pm because of a stop over in Gander and another one hour delay . This was one full day lost off our vacation and all we got was a 20 dollar coupon for food. No reason was given for the delay. The flight itself was good actually enjoyed the box pizza if you can believe that! Would I fly Sunwing again? undecided really I guess I would if it fit the budget & dates I wanted.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
Delayed for almost 8 hours in Las Vegas to Toronto. Apparently our plane was sent to Edmonton. Disappointment is lack of communication from any Sunwing representative. Waiting to check in we heard the delay from fellow passengers who had checked in. With significant delay would have been nice to have rep update us.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
Do not fly with Sunwing! We arrived at 3 am to check in for our flight at which time they told us we were delayed by 6 hours forcing us to kill time in the airport on no sleep. There should be notification of such changes this is unacceptable. We finally boarded a filthy plane and thus missed an entire day at our resort. Awful experience.

My mother and I flew to Nassau Bahamas on August 29 returned on September 4. Both flights were on time and all Sunwing staff were very helpful and friendly. We didn't have any problems with the service at all.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
We had an early morning flight (6.15) and were delayed due to an inflight computer problem. There were no coffee or tea served on the flight because the equipment was not working. The ground staff do not enforce their carry-on baggage rules which mean some people are going on with numerous pieces of luggage or luggage way larger that the specified sizes. If you follow the boarding procedures and are the last group to be called your chances of being able to put your carry-on in the overhead bins are very slight because of amount of carry-on luggage other people have put there. The seats are very tight with minimal legroom so when you have to stow you carry-on under the seat in front of you it just adds to the discomfort. The return flight was equally as bad for most of the same problems.

September 20 Vancouver to Puerto Vallarta flight 527. September 27 Puerto Vallarta to Vancouver flight 526. I will never fly Sunwing again. Seats are ridiculous with no leg room at all.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
We went from Toronto to Dominican in April for my 30th birthday booking about 3 months in advance and also paying $40 a person to pick our seats so the 4 of us would be sitting together. The day before our flight when we got to check in we notice that now it says Toronto to Montego Bay Jamaica and that our travel time went from 4 hours to 7. We called the airline they said that we have to stop first in Jamaica now drop people off wait while people board and then fly to Dominican! We get to the airport and we are all seated apart with me being by myself away from my friends. While at the airport we talked to several other people just as annoyed about going to Jamaica first and that this is common with Sunwing. We flew to Jamaica had to wait about an hour and 45 minutes on the plane then wait for people to board and finally fly to Dominican. Going home it was the same thing except the people coming back from Jamaica got on first and were the ones that had to stop in Dominican to wait for us. I've been to lots of all inclusive trips before and I have never had something like this happen. Would never ever fly them again. The planes are old no in seat entertainment everyone has to watch the same thing on these TV's hanging from the ceiling.

Just returned from a 1 week vacation in Cancun from Edmonton. We had no issues at all flights were on time crew were friendly food was fairly decent for airline standards flight was uneventful (in a good way). I didn't notice any cleanliness issues on the plane. The seats were quite cramped but what airplane seats aren't? Overall it was very average but no complaints.

My flight to Cancun was delayed 6 hours! You can imagine this is huge when you are only going on vacation for 1 week. We were supposed to arrive in Cancun at noon and have a full day of sunlight. Instead we arrived after dark and wasted a whole day. We were initially told that the delay was 4 hours and then kept changing it. We didn't know when to head to the airport - it was a nightmare. All Sunwing gave us was a breakfast voucher at 11am. Obviously a $10 voucher does not make up for a full day of all inclusive in Cancun.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
Flight from Las Vegas to Toronto Sep 12 2013. Upon arrival told that flight was delayed by 2 hours and given a $5.00 voucher to placate. Upon my own inspection of airport departure/arrival monitor saw that the incoming Sunwing flight from Toronto was not scheduled to arrive until 12.15 which would actually be over a 3 hour delay. Sure enough our plane did not arrive until 12.15 and then after cleaning refuelling etc. we did not board until 12.45 which was almost a 4 hour delay from our original departure time of 9.00am. No explanation given by Sunwing. Intentionally deceived us of real departure time. Upon arrival in Toronto Sunwing did not post the carrousel for our luggage. Took another 10 minute wait in line up for Sunwing Baggage questions to find out the carrousel number. This employee was very irritable. The best part of this flight was the movie!

We travelled August 2013 and the only reason we flew Sunwing was that it was the only choice for the dates we needed. Cabin crew meals cleanliness were all sub standard. Plane was filthy and cramped. Paid for extra leg room seat at emergency aisle and they don't tell you the seats don't recline. Poor. Delayed both going and coming totalling over 6 hours again with no explanation. Crew were uncooperative.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
We flew the champagne flight to Cuba. This meant we got the emergency seats as upgrade seats and a bit of lukewarm sparkling wine in a plastic cup. We were told our upgrade also included meal selection. So did everybody. My husbands entertainment center control (music and movie) was removed. The emergency exit seats were sold at a higher price and mostly to obese persons. This meant that the man that sat next to me was also sitting half way in my seat. The gentlemen in front of me also in an emergency exit seat had problems walking and boarding due to size. He would have been a hindrance during an emergency exit. Never Sunwing again so many better airlines.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
I will never fly this airline again. They delayed us 1.5 hrs on the way to Punta Cana without any explanation and then 3 hours on the way back. Flight attendants had no customer skills and it seemed as if they did not want to be there. Yes this airline might be cheap but I will pay $50 more and fly with other airlines. It seems as the other airlines appreciate my business more.

Departed Toronto for Punta Cana July 19. Flight an hour late departing. Inflight service and food were ok certainly better than flying AC. Resort was pleasant. Transport to airport scheduled to arrive at 7.30am for an 11.30am departure July 29th. Transport had not shown up by 8am. Told flight was delayed until 9.30pm airport shuttle to pick us at at 5.30pm. Of course our connection to Vancouver was lost. At 5 pm told flight delayed another 2 hours shuttle to pick us up at 7.30pm. At the airport had to stand around waiting for Westjet staff to get their act together. Checked in sat around a mostly shut down airport. Plane departed Punta Cana at 40 minutes past Midnight. Captain came on the intercom with a story about a bird strike in Nassau. Cabin crew started regular service as if everything was normal by pushing round the duty free cart to sell us stuff. No offer of free drinks or extra meals nothing. Will never fly with them again.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
Flew from Toronto to Los Cabos June 2013. We had upgraded to the 'larger seats' when we booked our all inclusive holiday. My husband needed the extra room after having had a knee replacement 3 months prior to the flight. We were assured the aisle seats we asked for were booked. When we got onto the flight the seats were not aisle side by side rather the bulkhead seats with a 'wall' in front so we were not able to extend our legs at all. When we asked the flight staff they told us they could not move us as all seats were taken. Outcome was my husband stood for most of the 5.5 hours it took to get to Cabo. When we got to Los Cabos airport ground staff said they had not request from Sunwing and that they could not give us different seats. Again we were on the same bulkhead seats and were unable to change seats. We will not fly Sunwing again!

July 31 - August 7 (Toronto - Cancun). Overall I found that the flight heading down and coming back were both very good. On both flights the plane either left on time or early and arrived at the scheduled destination on time. The staff were very friendly and knew how to do their jobs very well. The food was ok not great but it did hold me over for the 3.5 hour flight. I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised by how professional and smooth the whole travel experience was for me and my family.

Total 12hrs delay. July 29-Aug 2 2013. Outbound flight delayed 10hrs. Vague reason of "managerial decision regarding technical difficulty". Flight crew very rude with plenty of warning from pilot that "not our fault we only work here no tolerance etc". Not woken up for food drinks or snacks. Insulted with $75 voucher for future use. Return flight 2hr delay no apologies no explanation. First experience with Sunwing - not a good one.

Just returned from a trip to Cuba July 19th to 24th. A short vacation with a supposedly short flight. We were delayed out of Pearson originally 1 hr 20 mins and then due to bad weather another 4 plus hours. On the way home our flight was delayed over 3 hours and then had mechanical difficulties and was further delayed. This is not the first negative experience with Sunwing.

Edmonton Alberta Canada to Mexico just a little over a month ago. Trip down was average flight was on-time leaving and we even landed a little early. Flight attendants were alright on the way down but on the way back was a different story. Flight was 4 hours late getting to the airport but even before that the complementary service that took us from our resort to the airport got us there another 4 hours early. Spent 8 hours in the airport waiting for the flight. Once we finally were boarded we took off promptly I understood that everyone was tired but it is the flight attendants job to still be courteous and friendly which was not the case. The food was what we expected it to be on a plane and the "champagne flight" was actually a 1/4 cup of champagne in a little plastic glass that was only served on the way to our vacation not on the way home. Overall the trip was excellent one we got to our resort but the trip to and from there was horrible and I would defiantly not recommend flying with them nor would I ever fly with them again.

Vancouver - Puerto Vallarta July 12 return July 19. No delays. First flight out. Plane was not cleaned properly candy wrappers on floor dirty tray top dried liquid stains under seats crumbs on seats. Vancouver cleaning crew at fault? Could not check in on line 4 hours before - flight did not exist. Could not do self check at airport or the same reason. 4 am check in staff arrived 15 minutes late. Have never paid to book a seat before and was pleased with assigned seats.. Very little leg room. My big safety concern was no one sitting in an emergency exit row (no one willing to pay the $40). I would feel safer if they moved young able bodied people into these seats. A young fellow asked to sit in one seat and was told he would have to pay. Safety issue. First time flying this airline and I would use Sunwing again for the little extras they provide.

We flew Vancouver/Calgary to Varadero and return in late June 2013. Aside from a one hour delay leaving Vancouver the trip went well. The flight back even arrived 45 minutes early in both Calgary and Vancouver. The airplane going to Cuba had definitely seen cleaner days but the one coming back was fine. The meals they served were quite good. Inflight movies were OK. I travel a lot on business and I have to say that tight seats and so on are the norm and maybe some of the complaints about these kind of things are from people who's expectations are higher than their budgets. If you are more than 5'6" pay for the extra leg room! If you want to sit together - pay for the seat selection! With a smaller charter airline they don't have as many options when something slips as one of the bigger carriers - make sure your schedule has some wiggle room in case of problems.

Vancouver to Toronto and back. Was an excellent experience right through from check in to landing. Very professional crews and caring. I was travelling with a 17mth old who is teething so was in discomfort. The crew were always checking up on us as well as they tried to accommodate us to a better seat so our son would be comfortable.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
Our 5.5 hour flight turned into 10.5 after having to stop for fuel twice before reaching our destination. They blamed the first stop on strong headwinds and the second one on thunderstorms despite the sky being clear above the airport where we were supposed to land. The whole plane was starving by that time as they had only served a very light breakfast. On the return trip as soon as we were seated they announced that we would be delayed again by having to stop for fuel due to strong headwinds. After reading the other reviews about this airline I believe that they advertise flights as non-stop to get the seats booked knowing full well that they will have to stop for fuel. As if this wasn't bad enough the plane was absolutely filthy with gum and food all over the seats and it was clear that the bathroom hadn't been cleaned for some time. Avoid this airline at all costs.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
My husband one-year-old daughter and I flew Sunwing the week of May 25 2013 to a friend's wedding in Jamaica. We had an extra bag that we were quite willing to pay for - but I didn't need the long drawn-out lecture from the check-in agent about it. Paid $120 return for our extra piece. Check-in agent said she was going to put a note in our account that we had paid for the extra piece. Once we got to Montego Bay Sunwing's transportation to our hotel was disorganized and haphazard. When we arrived at the airport on our return and went to check in there was no note on the account saying that we paid for the extra piece of luggage. I was not impressed in the least. Thankfully the counter staff at the Montego Bay airport were excellent and competent. They agreed to take us at our word and not charge us again. My husband finally found the receipt we received from Sunwing showing that we paid for our extra luggage. Instead of lecturing me about my luggage maybe the Toronto check-in agent should have ensured that she put the information into our account. The flight attendants were good. The plane was cramped. The washrooms weren't as big as a closet. Those things I can understand from a budget airline but make sure your staff are competent.

Flew out of Montreal to Puerto Plata via St Maarten round trip April 21 to 28 seats were tight but comfortable the food was good the flights were on time. My only complaint is that the 3 landings were the roughest I have ever experienced in many years of flying.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
I was on my way to Cuba (Santa Clara) for a vacation departed on May 21st from Toronto at 6.20am. Boarded and left early 2 hours into our 3 hour flight the captain came on the PA and less than an hour from our destination we turned around and went back to where we started. Flight crew were sympathetic but Sunwing didn't offer anything other than an apology. Nothing for being 7 hours late to a destination. I had a tall person in the seat behind me who had no choice but to put her knees into my seat back. On the return it was worse. The airport at Santa Clara is a free for all. Of course it was a full flight and there were no seats left for us to sit together. Upon informing us of this offered an "upgrade" for $25 per person. Upon saying no he then offered us $20 pp. I have never heard of an airline offering a bargaining system like this. Upgraded seats known as "Elite Plus" are the same uncomfortable seats as the rest of the plane however you now have the legroom of any other standard plane in North America. Flight crew were rude. Forget about a blanket as "Sunwing does not stock us with blankets". In the future I will change my travel plans or even pay a little extra to avoid this airline at all cost.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
Flew out of Edmonton. Flight delayed for hours. I should have checked here first! The flight attendant was sympathetic. Flight was ok. Food was horrible. Flight back was delayed again no reason. Had to pay for extras at airport. Would not recommend. With all the delays and problems it is a joke airline.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
Flown with Sunwing 3 times have always had good experiences. Flights always been on time good flights informative pilots who let you know of weather updates/inform of upcoming turbulence flight attendant's have always been kind and willing to help! We just flew with them again May 8th-15th from Toronto to Cayo Coco and had another good experience. Our flight attendant was sweet and we had some good laughs with her! We upgraded to Elite this time and well worth it and will definitely fly Elite from now on not so much for the extra baggage but the leg room is well worth it! Always happy with their service and will continue to fly with them. Not saying complaints aren't valid but until I have a bad experience will continue to fly with them.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
On May 22 we travelled from Edmonton to Cancun. Our party included 4 adults and 1 baby. We left at 8am but before we left we fed the baby at a restaurant. We had snacks with us for her. About 1pm she became extremely hungry and we could not settle her. I asked if there was something I could buy because our baby was hungry. Told me no and that I should have packed something. She wouldn't even give us the breakfast they served because it was old so bringing something on board with us would not have been great either. I asked another who gave us a fruit cup but that didn't last long. Eventually given cheese and crackers which settled our baby. 5.5 hours is a long time for a child especially a baby. You cannot give a baby junk food when they are hungry.

Seats are not comfortable. My friend and I were separated on our flights we couldn't sit together there and back. Staff on the plane were not friendly and they were very rude to passengers nothing changed there and back.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
My family and I (a group of 13) travelled with Sunwing and I was extremely disappointed. First and last time with the airline. Flew from Toronto to Punta Cana. Staff in Toronto were not friendly and we all had different staff serving us. The seats were not comfortable and there was not much leg room. The food was good but that's about all I can say about this airline. When we came back from Punta Cana they wanted to charge me $40 for my carry on which was exactly the same weight as when I flew out. I ended up having to take clothing out and they would not let me put it in my suitcase. Staff were rude. Flight delayed 1 hour with no explanation and they did not bother to tell Westjet in Toronto that there were 13 of us who needed to catch the plane to Calgary as soon as we arrived. We ended up missing our flight in Toronto to Calgary.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
Flight out was fine. but flight back was delayed by over 8 hours. Was issued $150 for use on next flight but now they do not operate flights from Gatwick to Toronto. Still trying to reclaim $150 ca dollars to use for next flight to Canada.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
First and last time. The planes still have signs on the overhead bins in Slavic. To depart we were delayed 4.5 hours. Toilet problem. Like no one noticed that on the return flight the night before? They wait until the morning to fix it. No space for your legs or even to rest your arms. The TV screen popping out of the ceiling are the size of my cell phone. Seats were dirty and decorated with chewing gum. Staff going were not organized coming back a bit better. If you look at the trip over all and the extras you are dishing out for seat selection larger seats and all you may as well travel with a classier airline!

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
A great experience from the beginning to the end of our trip to Orlando. This airline is to be commended for its very low fares and no charge for baggage. The flight crew was courteous and the trip was very fast. The fact that this was a direct flight puts it above the other airlines where long stopovers at another airport are very common. We will indeed fly with them again.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
Took a trip to Dreams Riviera Cancun May 6-10 with my wife and 6 month old child. How can an airline book separate seats for husband and wife plus infant? Sunwing staff agent at Montreal Trudeau airport were more concerned for collecting 200$ from us on excess baggage charges and rushed us to our gate not informing us of the surprise we were to receive boarding the plane. We had to pay another $38 to ensure that we didn't run into another seat booking issue. Upon our day for return Sunwings bus transport was nowhere to be seen an hour later finally a transport van showed up. Get to the airport and again we had to pay 100$ for excess baggage. Sunwing was so disappointing! Never again will I book with such a sub par vacation airline.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
I travelled to Mexico twice in the last month with Sunwings and I will never book my trip through that airline again! First trip the airline crew was not accommodating. First flight down was delayed 4 hours. Told we were going to receive a $50 voucher towards our next flight with Sunwing. Still waiting on that voucher. The second trip I took the crew down were horrific! I was sitting with my infant daughter in the first row and the stewardess kept hitting me with elbows etc and I was tucked in to my seat and so was my child without body parts hanging out. There was absolutely no control over passengers by the crew. There were a few passengers that opened their duty free bottles and were drinking them on the plane. Nothing was said or done. I had 3 young children on the plane that didn't need to be subjected to that. The planes were horrible! Tiny aisles broken parts in the washrooms etc.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
Just returned from a trip to Cancun Mexico with Sunwing. I have flown Sunwing for many years and have always found them to be an exceptional company. I just recently recommended them to my sister for her trip to Cuba. When she returned just a week before we left she told me about there terrible experience on their return flight. I had booked our flight many months in advance as my husband has a disability and we prefer to sit at the back of the plane so that he can board first and get off last. Also he needs a direct flight as he doesn't do well with long periods on the plane. We also prebook the seats to insure our seating. Much to our surprise the flight down had originated in Calgary with the plane half full when it arrived in Vancouver okay it was still direct from Vancouver. On the return trip the plane flew to Calgary first after. A one hour delay. In Cancun where they changed our departure gate just before boarding offering my husband no assistance to get there. Then we all lined up in a big jumbled mess to board a bus they crammed to the fullest to drive to the plane where we had to climb a staircase to board the plane in the crush of all the people who had no concern for disabled or families with small children. It was a gong show! When I said those exact words to the flight crewone woman rolled her eyes at me! When we finally reached Vancouver we discovered they had lost one of our suitcases! Two days later we still have not had any contact with anyone from Sunwing as to where it is. I have been a loyal customer for many years probably will not use Sunwing in the future!

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
Cannot believe how poor the service has become. We have using Sunwing to fly to Puerto Plata for years. In November we were delayed at the POP airport for 5 hours. They gave each of us a $10 food voucher for a particular restaurant. The food was terrible. We recently travelled to Puerto Plata at the beginning of April. We specifically booked the flight which arrived at our hotel by noon. Three weeks before departure Sunwing advised us that the flight times had changed and we were being re-routed to POP via Jamaica. So a 4 hour flight turned into 7 hours and we arrived after dinner at the hotel. Unfortunately before departure I became ill with extreme nausea and a fever. During the flight my husband asked the stewardess for a cold cloth as I was about to pass out. Her only help was to inquire if I had breathing problems. My husband had to go to the washroom to get the cloth. It was a 7 hour flight from hell.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
This is the 3rd time that my flight has been delayed. First flight was flying to Dominican Republic as soon as we got to the airport we were told our flight was delayed 8 hours. Given a food voucher for 20 dollars but only for a specific restaurant and the food was terrible. Now I'm flying back from Mexico to Toronto and I was told that my flight is delayed 6 hours. When they post their All Inclusive vacation they try to make the flight schedule more attractive of course most people would not want to arrive 2 am in the morning. Once you're booked all of a sudden your flight schedule is changed and there's nothing much you can do about it. I should have learnt my lesson.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
Our flight from Montreal to Cayo Coco was between the 7th and 14th of April. Outbound and return flight was on time in fact we arrived ahead of schedule. We have flown many times with Sunwing and have always been pleasant good food with wine and great service with a smile.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
My family and I flew from Deer Lake to Punta Cana. We had the elite seats which we paid extra for. We travelled with our 10 month old baby. Leaving Deer Lake we were delayed over 3 hours. There was no pre- boarding. No one to help us. On the way back there was no pre-boarding or elite boarding. I was stuck in a massive queue with my baby. We were on the plane for over 2 hours waiting no complementary drinks. On top of it all they had all of our bags going to the wrong place. Finally made it to Deer Lake. A 5 hour flight took us 12 hours.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
Flew from Halifax Nova Scotia to Varadero Cuba on April 5 2013 return April 12 2013. The staff both going and return were great. Food served on the plane was surprisingly good both times. My only complaint was that both leaving Halifax and return we were close to an hour late for no apparent reason other than the fact that they delayed the boarding. Returning we were supposed to be taking off at 8.55 Varadero time and they didn't even start boarding until 8.50. But having chronic back pain issues I was just glad that we weren't sitting on the tarmac for the hour delay and that I was still generally comfortable in the airport.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
So it appears with other reviews our flight was delayed from Calgary to Cuba by almost 4 hours as well with the crew joking that they had no idea why? We had flown Sunwing for years however the decline in service is so drastic that this will be our last trip with Sunwing.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
Elite Plus means you pay more that is it. There are no signs at airport in Calgary to let you know where to go as an Elite member. The food is done for choices by the time you get yours towards the middle. Trying to get a hold of someone if there are issues with your luggage is near impossible. No vouchers were given to us even though we were supposed to get them at check in and after that no one knew anything about them even though it showed on my confirmation slip what was supposed to happen. Plane was delayed from other city so was 7 hours late. The whole airline feels like a money grab and once they have it they couldn't care less what service they provide.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
We flew out of Halifax Mar 27 early morning to Cuba. On time flight attendants were friendly and helpful. This flight had many children on board and all received attention from staff. Food service was very good! Received free headphones but make sure to keep them for the return flight. Movie and music was enjoyable. I would not hesitate to use this airline again in the future.

Flew from Edmonton to Huatulco with no problems at all. On time and arrived early. When we left the flight was delayed by 20 minutes but we arrived right on time. Entertainment was great going down but coming home only 1 movie with 2 shows. Not very good for a 5.5 hour flight. Coming home turbulence was the worst I have ever experienced. The pilot and flight crew did their best in those conditions. Excellent hot meals and snacks. Upgraded to the Elite Plus and would do so again. Overall the best airline we have flown with so far.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
I went to the Bahamas over the Easter weekend with my family and our flight was delayed 2 hours so we spent 5 hours in the airport. On the way back from the Bahamas our flight was delayed again by 2 hours and got to spend another 5 hours in the airport. Don't think that this is acceptable I can understand being delayed once but to do it to the same people twice was not acceptable.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
Flew from Toronto to Las Vegas return. The flight there was ok only delayed by a few minutes. Only downside was that the cabin crew were not very responsive. However the flight back was delayed by close to 4 hours and passengers were only given a $10 fast food voucher. No explanation as to why the flight was delayed. After getting on the flight the staff were rude and they just don't care about passengers. The meals were awful.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
I travel regularly for business and recreation and have not had an experience quite like Sunwing. You can't use their web check in until 4 hours before you fly what's the point if you need to be at the airport 3 hours ahead of time. Before we left for the airport I checked the status of the flight which was supposed to be on time. When we arrived at the airport there were no Sunwing reps at the check in desk which was odd. We checked in using the kiosk and went through security. An hour and a half before we were to start boarding the flight from Toronto to Cancun was updated to be 7 hours delayed. No announcement and no Sunwing reps anywhere to be found. We were given $25 coupons for food which doesn't go very far at the airport and considering we lost a day out of a 5 day vacation didn't seem quite appropriate.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
Vancouver to Santa Clara and back. In both cases the planes ran out of fuel and we had to make re-fuelling stops which were not scheduled. Both times the crew made excuses. The crew were nice though. The air- conditioning worked poorly. No inflight entertainment whatsoever. The only positive thing is the option of paying an extra $40 and getting a seat with more leg room. I cant imagine how people manage in the regular seats.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
Cincinnati to Cancun flight delayed 2.5 hours. Week later Cancun to Cincinnati flight delayed 5 hours. Bathrooms were the most disgusting I have seen and I was the first to use them as I was in the last row and first in line. We got one drink on a 3 plus hour flight. Crew not friendly after they were so late taking off. Other airlines are worth the extra money. With others you get there on time and you are hydrated when you arrive. Sunwings needs some serious improvement. This flight was $638 Will gladly pay more for a different provider.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
Calgary to Cancun flight delayed 12.5 hrs due to 'no crew available'. We were not notified of delay until we arrived at the airport at 6 am only to be turned away and told to come back for a 10pm flight which was also delayed. Were given food vouchers for the airport when we arrived again in the evening after we had just eaten dinner at home so they were useless. A minimal value non-transferable coupon for a future Sunwing vacation within the next year as "compensation" is also completely worthless. An entire day of our week's vacation was wasted.

Feb 23rd 2013 3 of us flew from Ottawa to Punta Cana. I paid premium for the bigger seats I had the bulkhead seat which when there was a queue for the toilet passengers would get in between me and the bulkhead. When I complained I was scorned by the flight crew they told me that they had a right to be there. The crew were also apparently bilingual the girl reading the pre-flight instructions could barely make it with the French part. This was also called the champagne flight the champagne cup is the size of a pill tumbler.

From Edmonton touch down in Regina to Jamaica. Well that's what is was supposed to be. It was Edmonton to Regina sit on runway for 3 hours then 2 more hours to Toronto sit for 1 hour then 5 hours to Jamaica. No alcohol served until the final leg to Jamaica and they ran out of alcohol before making it half way through serving the plane so people at the back didn't get anything.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
Terrible customer service! We were delayed coming back from Punta Cana. Not a Sunwing rep in sight at the airport. All signs showed on time even after we had been delayed a couple of hours with no explanation. Had to walk out to the tarmac not so bad to do in Punta Cana but not so nice when arriving back in Moncton in a snow storm. Make sure you're wearing proper shoes and bring a coat back with you. Luggage was damaged during the non-stop flight from Punta Cana to Moncton. The Sunwing reps are not being helpful in expediting compensation for that. Once they have your money you're on your own. Don't expect any help!

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
Trip to Orlando waited 2.5 hours in a line-up then waited another 2.5 hours before boarding. Because there were only 2 ticket agents on with 2 flights going out we missed clearing customs in Canada and after arriving in Orlando we waited 2 more hours to get through customs and had to wait another 1.4 hrs to get luggage. Waited 8 hours for a 3.5 hour direct flight. Return flight waited 2 hours in line up to get to ticket agent. Time change now flight is delayed 1.5 hours. Plane was sitting at the airport so why the delay? They blamed US customs. Arrived in Halifax we had to wait one hour to retrieve our bags from the plane. I am a frequent flier and thought I'd try out their direct flight - never again. I could make two stop-overs and still get to Florida quicker.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
My wife and I purchased the "Elite" package for flying. The only thing that we received for the $100/person was the extra baggage weight. The occupants in seat 1 abc and 2 abc are very cramped yes you can stretch your legs out but the seats are "very" narrow. If in seat 1c as I was you can not stretch your legs as your feet go into the aisle leading into the stewardess station. We found the stewardess very unpleasant.

Plane broke down while refuelling in Saskatoon on our way to Vancouver so 4 hours sitting on the runway until they decided it couldn't be fixed easily. Then 2 hours in a line up for a single Sunwing rep for 184 passengers to get a hotel voucher for the night. Was 4am by the time we were in our room and asleep! They insisted we come back by 10am - the plane wasn't fixed and ready for another 2 hours! All in all was a painful return.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
Our family vacation from Calgary to Cancun Mexico got off to a bad start. Our flight was scheduled for 9.30am but got delayed 12.5 hrs without any explanation. We were given voucher for taxi to go home with all of our luggage and to come back in the evening to try again. We lost almost 1 day out of our 1 week vacation. I understand that delays are bound to happen from time to time but a 12.5 hrs delay without good reason/explanation is not acceptable.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
Vancouver to Havana Cuba via Varadero - trip down and all local connections were on schedule and as advertised. Simple and clean service at Cuba customs and immigration. Return flight was the usual nightmare. Some delay in departure but advised of a re-routing through Saskatoon for refuelling. Some mechanical problem caused further delays. 4 hours on the tarmac further delays then deplaned to spend the night in Saskatoon. Only one attendant handing out vouchers at 3am. 1pm departure the next day became 3pm. Flight Saskatoon to Vancouver and landing were uneventful. Can only be taken by people prepared for 24 hour delays. Bring your own food prepare to camp out at airports and on planes.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
Toronto to Las Vegas during March Break 2013. We got in early on the way to Vegas. I chose Sunwing for the daytime flights. All other airlines have overnight flights to Vegas. Plane was a bit delayed on the way back coming in but the actual flights were great considering the time of year. Yes it's cramped in the plane but that's what charter is all about. I don't know any other airline nowadays that gives you free checked luggage food drinks twice plus snacks for a 4 hour flight.

My husband and I flew Elite Plus with Sunwing March 6 2013 to Cancun returned to Calgary on March 13 2013. Both flights left a couple minutes early. Both ways we received excellent service at check in counter elite plus counter was great as their was no line priority seating. We hardly stood in line at all more leg room and roomier seats are definitely worth the money. Flight attendants were friendly. Food was basic but decent - I've had much worse. Morning flight to Cancun I chose the French toast which was okay and then on the way home I chose the Honey mustard chicken with rice which surprisingly was good came with crackers and cheese and a brownie for dessert. Complimentary wine was good. They played one in flight family friendly movie each way. No Complaints whatsoever will fly Sunwing again.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
Terrible experience coming back from our vacations. It took almost 4hrs standing in line just to do the check- in in Puerto Vallarta. They had 2 full flights leaving within 20 mins of each other and wanted to process all passengers at the same time but they weren't able to do it of course. Delay was attributed to a computer network malfunction. To add insult to injury once we were checked in they told us in a rude manner to hurry up to the gate if we didn't want to miss the flight! It's too bad we had to go through that because overall the rest of the flight services were good.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
Flew to Punta Cana from Saint John New Brunswick on March 4 2013. Flight was on time with no problems. The captain was great informing us where we were during the 4 hour flight etc. Return flight on March 11 2013 was a different story. Told by our Sunwing rep. that the flight was delayed 5 hours so we stayed at the resort for the extra few hours. Decided to cab it to the airport to avoid the long line-ups at the check-in counter. We were the second couple to check in and were told that we could not get seats together which was probably a language issue since the staff couldn't even speak English. We received a $20 voucher for Wendy's I assume for the delay. On the flight home I asked if they were going to pass out the Canadian Custom forms for us to fill out before we got there. The answer was "they didn't have any". A girl in front of me asked for ear-phones and was told she was supposed to keep the ones she was given on the flight down. No champagne on the flight back. I guess "champagne flight" means one glass on the departing flight only. There was a huge line-up for Customs once we arrived because 180 of us had to fill out the forms in the airport. Finally got home at 4am Tuesday morning. We were originally scheduled be home about 10pm Monday night.

Our trip was booked from Toronto to San Jose Costa Rica (direct). They changed it to non-direct via Panama (added 3 hours onto our travel) and noted that this would not be compensated. Flight home from San Jose was delayed 4 hours. Once on the plane it was further delayed by 2 hours - as we had to stop in Cozumel for fuel. None of it was compensated (not even a free beer).

My husband and I flew to Cancun in February 2013. Great flight no delays and friendly staff. This is the second trip with Sunwing since 2012 and we have no complaints. I read lots of complaints about delays etc. however some delays cannot be avoided i.e. mechanical problems weather. We intend on going back again next February and it will definitely be with Sunwing.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
We flew last year with no complaints however this Feb we flew to Cuba. The flight down was fine our return flight from Varadara we had to fly to Holguin Cuba. I understand mechanical problems happen but very little information was given to us and our 3.5 hr trip turned into 5.5 hr trip which I found very uncomfortable. We always try to buy duty free on the plane but they never have enough stock on board.

Flight 420 from Toronto to Punta Cana delayed 7.5 hours on Friday March 1/13. Weather was no issue. 5 out of 7 Sunwing flights were delayed that day from 4 to 7.5 hours. Spent first full day of our vacation at the airport. They said a bird flew into the engine and it had to be replaced so they were renting a plane. Must have been a 'big' flock of birds that took out 5 planes! Rental plane had long washroom queues due to broken toilet. Return flight delayed 1 hour 22 minutes! They kept apologizing for the 'short' delay.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
We flew with Sunwing this past Feb and our experience is much the same as everyone else. Delayed delayed delayed. Excuses and rude staff - not acceptable. We lost a full day off the beginning of our Cuba vacation and the weather was perfect for 2 days prior to departure. We were told they couldn't get crew to fly our plane. Very bad communication vouchers are garbage read the fine print. Never again will we trust Sunwing with our hard earned vacation.

March 3 WG 510 Cancun to Toronto. 8 hours delay. Flight supposed to leave around 2.30pm and left close to 11pm. Nobody gave any reason why flight was delayed. The only statement from the captain was that this plane came around 5 pm after being delayed on some other flight. He had no further details. Ironically there was an incoming flight from Toronto which landed around 2 pm. Either way the policy of disinformation was only topped by rude and unfriendly hostesses. Not heating the plane must save money. Everybody sat there in their sweaters and coats. Solution next time it's another airline.

Our flight on Feb 28 from Varadero Cuba to Windsor was delayed 7 hrs There was various explanations given from Sunwing Reps but still don't know the real cause of the delay. Once we were in the air we were told that due to mechanical problems our flight would be diverted to Toronto. We were reassured that there would be another flight to fly us from Toronto to Windsor. Once we were deplaned we found out it was all a lie and that there was no plane available to fly to Windsor. After a 3 hour wait we were loaded onto Greyhound buses and were subjected to a bumpy 4 hour drive down the 401. We finally arrived in Windsor On March 1 at 4am. This was a 14 hour delay in our arrival time. Sunwing has offered no compensation. Will never fly Sunwing again!

Will never fly again with this airline. Flight going to Punta Cana was delayed 3 hours. I understand things like this happen. However the return flight was delayed a whole day and the only way we found this out was when the airport shuttle didn't show up to pick us up at the resort and we called them. They then moved us to another "resort" for the night. Then after we had to get up at midnight to meet the shuttle the flight continued to be delayed and we had to sit in the airport for hours. We did make it back home a whole day later. Don't let the cheap price fool you.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
Delayed from our original departure time of 3pm out of Toronto on February 16th due to a snow storm. We were on the tarmac ready to go when we got called back. The pilot announced there would be a 2 hour delay before the weather broke however he also told us that because we were an International flight and at a domestic gate we could not leave the plane and also that we would be refuelling. After 30 mins we were allowed off the plane and walked into the "International terminal". Given a $30 voucher for food only. I will not use this airline again. We sat and waited while planes with scheduled departures after ours left. Our plane left at 4.45 am getting into Aruba at around 10.30. We essentially lost an entire day of our vacation.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
Flew to Mexico on Feb 21. Upon check in at Pearson no notice was given that our flight was delayed by 2 hours. At the end of our trip while waiting for shuttle pick up (which was assured to be on time the day before) we waited in the resort lobby for 6 hours after checking out of our room because of a flight delay our Sunwing rep was nowhere to found and when reached by phone had no information as to why we where left stranded. After finally getting to the airport around 6pm instead of noon. Only to find the flight has been delayed even longer. In short we were to be back in Toronto on Feb 28 at 7:30 pm however arrived back at 4:00 am March 1. No apology given until deplanning. Worst airline service I have ever experienced will not be using Sunwing again.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
My wife and I flew 8 February. Day of our trip arrived and there was a snow storm. An hour before the flight I asked if we would be getting out I was assured we would be going that night. 2 hours after scheduled departure we were told the flight would be delayed - delayed not cancelled. An hour later told to get our bags and go back through security. We would be waiting until morning to depart. They escorted us through security and dropped us at baggage claim. Our bags eventually showed an hour later. We headed for the ticket counter to see what could be done - ticket counter was closed and nobody from Sunwing was in the airport. We spent the first night of our vacation on the floor in the terminal. Air Canada brought us snacks blankets and water. Finally as 'compensation' we were given a letter offering $150 off a future booking to be used within a year. On our return told our flight was delayed 3 hours. Sure enough we arrived at the airport and there was no plane we sat there for 4 more hours finally starting to board at 2am.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
Extremely disappointed with the flight to Montego Bay Feb 10 supposed to leave 6am. Eventually left at 11.30 return flight supposed to leave at 11.20 am. eventually left at 9.55pm. No good reason was given for either delay. The plane itself was dated and on the outgoing flight only one toilet worked this for over 150 passengers. The seating and comfort on the plane was cramped and on the return flight one enormous passenger forced the central passenger in a 3 seat row to leave his wife and find another seat. The on-line flight service up to leaving time stated that both flight were on time considering that one had to be at the airport 2-3 hours beforehand only exacerbated the situation. Sunwing's poor departures spoiled what would have been an excellent vacation and a $75 credit voucher does not make up for the poor service.

Flew to Punta Cana from Ottawa on February 2. Plane left at 6 am got to the airport at 3.30 am. First shock there was a huge queue and only 2 boarding agents. Next shock the plane itself. An old Czech 737 a 28-row plane with 32 rows. I'm 6'3" the seat was almost painful. Crew members were cheery. The real horror story was the flight home supposedly on the 9th. Told to be ready for pick up at the resort at 9.30 am. While waiting told a storm in the US Northeast had caused a delay that we were to be picked up at 11.30 pm. Then advised the plane was going to leave at 6.15 Sunday morning. Picked up at 3 am taken to the airport checked in got to the gate - our flight was delayed until 12.30! No one from Sunwing was there of course. Finally a plane landed at 6.00 and we boarded the sardine can and flew home. Got to Ottawa 22 hours late.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
Very disappointed flight delayed more than 12 hrs - told snow storm in Calgary. Check live weather feed and clear and sunny and no snow. Offered $150 off next vacation with Sunwing to be used in the next 12 months. They don't care now that they have your money.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
Flight to Cancun on February 2 2013 went well. Was impressed by the Flight Attendants' service. Flight and service back home was very disappointing and very frustrating. Delayed 16 hours in Cancun. Confusion disorganization and no Sunwing Representative to explain anything. Will not travel Sunwing again!

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
Very disappointed. Departure flight to Cuba was delayed more than 12 hours and the return flight was more than 4 hours. Worst customer service ever experienced - would never pay Sunwing for a vacation in the future.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
Ottawa to Varadero Cuba and return. Both flights were delayed. Ottawa to Varadero was supposed to leave at 5.15pm Saturday delayed until 6am Sunday. Received notice that it was only supposed to be delayed until 3.50am Sunday. Had to wait 6 hours at the airport. No clear explanation given as to why there was a delay. Same thing leaving Varadero except no notice. Flight scheduled to leave at 10.15pm Saturday flight delayed until 12 pm Sunday - 13+ hour delay. No announcements no explanation as to the delay. We had to go through customs in Cuba twice because of leaving to go to the hotel they provided. They were so disorganized by the time we got checked in we only had 3 hours of sleep. We arrived back in Ottawa at about 4pm.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
We were delayed 10 hrs from Jamaica Feb 17 2013. Never told until we got down to check out at 5am that we were delayed until 9.30 pm. Rep was no help said didn't know what was going on we sat in the lobby all day until at 6pm a bus finally came for us. No empathy at all from this airline or their reps when we were there. Not one persons story matched the others cannot feel we can trust this airline for any help so do not see ever flying with them again!

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
First and last time we will use Sunwing Airlines. Trip to Cuba delayed on Feb 4th by over 8 hours. Return flight home which was supposed to be on Monday Feb 11th at 5pm didn't take off from Cuba to Vancouver until Tuesday Feb 12th at 6am (a 12.5 hour delay). Again no real explanation as to why? This airline needs to shape up I know they're a charter airline but they don't seem to care about their passengers.

Going to Puerto Vallarta Feb 3/13 to Feb 10/13. Stood in line for 1.5 hours to get checked in. They told us flight was delayed but couldn't tell us for how long. They gave us a $15 food voucher and sent us to wait. Flight was 3 hours late. Interestingly on the departure board all Sunwing flights were delayed. Got on plane and none of the headphone outlets worked in my row of seats therefore couldn't watch or listen to anything. The other problem I have with Sunwing is their baggage allowance. All other airlines I've flown with give you a 50 lb baggage allowance but Sunwing only allows you 44 lbs. Big difference especially if you are travelling for more than one week. Plus the 5 kg carry on allowance is ridiculous. Our empty carry on suitcases (new hard shell light weight) with one pair of shoes was 5 kg so I travelled to Mexico with 2 virtually empty carry ons. I wouldn't recommend this airline especially if you have to make a connection. I would be worried about their problem with flight delays.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
Horrible experience on more than one occasion and destination with this airline. I will choose to pay extra and have a stop over to avoid flying them again! I will only fly them again if there is no other choice. The only reason I am giving the airline a 2 and not a 0 is because I had decent flight attendants and was served a decent meal. People at the check in counter both in Calgary and other countries awful as well. Not willing to help and each person you talk to will give you a different story.

The blizzard in Halifax on February 9th shut down the entire airport and we were sure our vacation was ruined. Sunwing flew their plane in switched crews and got us to Cuba with only a couple hours delay. The only plane to get out of Halifax last weekend. The crew were friendly kept us informed we had meals and champagne.

I recently flew to Bahamas Feb 3rd from Toronto my first time flying with them and will be my last. On the way to Bahamas we had a 6.05pm flight which we found out last min was delayed - they said 3 hrs no explanation. Asked the Sunwing Reps and they said they had no idea why it was delayed weather was great that day. They gave us a $10 food voucher. Check in was very slow they only had 2 people working and they had to hand write everyone's vouchers. Took off a 9pm which got us to Bahamas at midnight arrived at our resort close to 2 am. Return flight also delayed 4 hrs it was scheduled to leave at 10.30 pm but left at 2.30 am no explanation at all! At this time of night the Bahamas airport was basically closed down no food or water. We were signed up to get email notifications of any delays we received nothing! Disappointing.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
Used Sunwing vacations for a trip to Puerto Vallarta on Feb 1 2013. Flight delayed 4 hours leaving Ottawa. Not only was there no explanation but they only told us that at check in. Leaving Mexico the same thing happened. After saying it was on time the plane was 2.5 hours late and again they only told us at the airport rather that let us wait at the hotel were we could eat drink and relax. The seats are so small if you have a larger passenger next to you you'll have to sit at an angle in order to fit. I'll never use Sunwing again.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
Recently flew back from Jamaica with Sunwing and was very disappointed. Their representatives in Jamaica were not helpful in any situation. As for the airline itself all I can say that they have very poor communication skills. Our flight got delayed a few times during the day until finally we board the plane just to get off again in a few minutes. Very disorganized - they did not give us any reasons. The one day delay would not have been just a big deal if we would have been told from the beginning. On top of the run- around since they knew from the night before that they did not have any food for us on the plane no one told us to get something into us before we board. It was 7 hours without food. We did get a $150 voucher for our next trip really?

We travelled back from Punta Cana on February 2nd actually February 3rd as our flight was delayed for several hours. Checked out of our resort on Saturday morning for a 12.30 flight only to be told by the Sunwing rep that the flight was delayed until midnight no real excuse given! At around 6 my husband checked the board again went to the Sunwing rep and found out the flight was further delayed. The plane was delayed for another hour when we finally boarded we were served a dinner menu at 7 in the morning! Not provided with headphones even though the movie was playing. The plane was so small I am a small person but could not even move my legs! Never ever again would I fly this airline. We were re-imbursed the $49 for the hotel room. As far as I am concerned this airline is just providing a shuttle service back and forth to these resorts and it is only to make money customers do not matter to them!

Feb 1 - Feb 8 Ottawa - Puerto Vallarta. Flight out was 5.5 hours late due to late departure from Cuba and slow service in Ottawa. Were given meal vouchers and waited. Flight was fine elite seats with extra leg room was nice but seat mates who sprawl aren't. Entertainment system wasn't working properly - sound kept dropping out. Service was fine. Return was 1.5 hours late but was on day of major storm in Canada that saw many stranded but not us. Flight was fin. All in all no worse no better than other charter airlines.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
Sunwing flight to Varadero was only delayed by an hour and a half due to weather (de-icing). Flight crew was great food was ok and included wine. This was from Windsor on Jan 31st. Return flight on Feb 7th was equally good. I have heard of delays but most of them are weather related and flyers have to be aware that safety is first priority.

### Sunwing Airlines customer review
I booked with Sunwing for Feb 13 2013 going from Toronto to Las Vegas. It was a 3.30pm flight. The plane pushed back from the gate right on time and headed for the runway. Once there it turned around and headed back to the gate. The pilot said there was a slight problem and it would only take an hour to fix. We sat on the plane for 1.5 hours and then de-boarded. I asked at the gate if there was a chance that the flight would be cancelled and was assured that we would be departing. Finally at 9.30pm they cancelled the flight. No explanations no apologies nothing. I was told on the return flight that Sunwing doesn't even own their planes. They rent them from different airlines all over the world. The plane we were on for the return trip was from Czech Airlines. I will never fly Sunwing again.

We were to fly Jan 14 from Calgary to Cancun at 10.15am. When we arrived at the airport there was a notice - flight delayed until 8.50pm. Given a voucher for a hotel room but no food. Later told when the flight from Cuba arrived we would take this plane. However our flight crew was sent elsewhere. When we arrived at 5.50pm checked luggage without incident cleared security and off to have a drink. 1.5 hrs later we hear one announcement for Sunwing. No reps to be found Westjet employee advised us that the flight was cancelled and would go tomorrow at 11.45 am. Collected the luggage got in yet another queue for hotel and food vouchers. Minimal staff present to answer questions. The next morning we check in again and learn the plane we are taking to Cancun was to go to Huatulco. There is poor management starting at the top lack of organization possible poor maintenance on airplanes and huge lack of service. We lost 26 hours of our vacation. I will not recommend Sunwing or fly Sunwing ever again!
