### "inferior business class"
Having arrived at Azerbaijan Airlines lounge at GYD prior to my departure on J2809 I was informed that due to technical issues with B763 (mm a substitute A320 will perform the flight. I discovered that this A320 was configured as all economy 186. AZAL offered to compensate the difference which would have been rather small. As I chose to fly with AZAL because of the 170 degree lie-flat 763 seat, I refused. Ground staff organized a hotel, and I departed next morning on an A320 with a significantly inferior business class. Lounge and ground crew were as friendly as they could,

### "lost my suitcase"
Azal Airlines lost my suitcase during a connecting flight. Despite repeated attempts to get an update, they’ve provided no clear answers about where my luggage went. I’ve been left in the dark. Their incompetence and disregard for customer care are shocking.

### "it was a good flight"
Offered sandwich and drinks at this very short flight. I love flying on Embraer planes in a short regional flights as they are very comfortable. Staffs were OK both on ground and on board. All in all it was a good flight in terms of schedule, service & ticket price.

### "disappointed with ground staff"
The airline staff at Baku airport were not friendly and their mismanagement resulted in missing one of our original flights. They did not bother if we stayed in the Baku airport the next days as the other flights were booked. So, the ground staff charged us double for another closer city (Tbilisi). We used this airline for our summer travels from London to Baku  and Baku to Batumi and return. Overall, we flew four times and were very disappointed with ground staff and old aircraft (e.g. faulty entertainment screens).

### “Extremely unfriendly”
Extremely unfriendly. No smile on the face of the staff. It looked like they were forced to work - a drudgery. They blocked the middle passage with a food trolly for nearly 90 minutes and would not allow a senior citizen to pass towards the lavatory. When he got desperate and a little angry the steward Ahamad shouted at him. The lady staff member would hide he name and when I tried to read it she pointed at the camera and threatened me. The food too was nothing to write home about. The omelet was dry. No in-flight entertainment or wi-fi. Did not get any boarding pass online when I reserved my seat despite giving my cell number and email. Next time I'd rather fly Indigo to Baku via New Delhi.

### “cabin was too warm”
The cabin was too warm which made this short flight rather uncomfortable, also it was a rather turbulent one. They served a good sandwich with complimentary drinks which in my opinion is a very nice gesture. Legroom was premium as were the seats.

### "expected us to wait in Baku airport for 2 days"
Not Verified | We had a flight from Dubai to London Heathrow with a 2-hour transit in Baku. Due to the over 7-hour delay from Azerbaijan Airlines in providing the flight to Baku, we missed our next flight which was from Baku to London, and their next available flight from Baku to London was in two days. After 30 minutes of the departure time, the Dubai Airport staff at the boarding gate informed us that there is a delay but they do not know how long the delay would take and so we should purchase another ticket at the airport. As the next flight from Baku to London was in two days, we had to purchase another super expensive ticket at the airport just to arrive at our destination to be at our work on time. Now, not only they do not refund our first tickets which they could not provide the services for, but they also do not refund the full cost of the new tickets.

### "Refusing to do a refund"
I will never purchase a flight ticket from them again as they are irresponsible. Refusing to do a refund now and they're telling me they can't find me in the system. Basically lost my money and voucher because it is expired.

### "cannot hold our money for that long"
We were planning to fly from London Heathrow to Baku on 20th March 2020 but we had to cancel our flights due to the global pandemic. Azerbaijan Airlines responses is "Refund can be processed after the regular flights' resumption" This has been the answer since 2020 and it has been more than 2 years. All  other airlines got back to their normal flights but Azerbaijan Airlines. I totally understand this was an okay excuse in the beginning but after 2 years it cannot be accepted. They cannot hold our money for that long.

### "refusing to refund our tickets"
We were due to fly from London Heathrow to Baku on 9th July. Our flight for 3 adult tickets was cancelled due to the global pandemic. Azerbaijan Airlines are refusing to refund our tickets and the complaints e-mail is never answered. Our onward flights with Air Astana were refunded in full and they could not have been more helpful, the difference between the 2 airlines is profound I resorted to sending a cross e-mail to all the global offices of AZAL, plus putting messages on Facebook in the vain hope of eliciting some sort of acceptable response but it had no effect.

### "have only offered a voucher"
Not Verified |  We had a flight booked to Baku for the 4th June and this was cancelled due to Covid-19. We had booked the flight through Expedia along with the hotel. No issues with a refund from the hotel but the airline has been a different story. They advised Expedia that they refuse to offer a refund and have only offered a voucher. We disputed this as unlikely to be flying to Azerbaijan any time soon but again, told this was not happening and we would only be offered a voucher. Our credit card company have got involved and they have been told the same thing. I understand they have a no cancellation policy but surely the exceptional circumstances the whole World are in at the moment should be taken into consideration?! Not impressed in the slightest and will not be booking with them again!

### "Azerbaijani food was delicious"
My first trip ever on Azerbaijan Airlines from Baku to Istanbul. The fare was surprisingly competitive. The plane was an older A319 with no individual PTV screens, it still had ash trays in the arm rests. But the leg room was generous in economy. The cabin crew was efficient with good English proficiency, but hardly a smile to me. A full dinner was served which was Azerbaijani food and which was delicious. Overall not a bad experience on Azerbaijan Airlines and I would fly with them again in the future.

### "seats and leg space were very good"
First time to fly Azerbaijan Airlines on a short break from Dubai to Baku, A319 and A320 aircraft were used. Both planes were a bit older and looked tired however seats and leg space were very good. No entertainment only the overhead screens which was showing some programs but yet couldn’t used earphones as nothing can be heard from the audio set. Food was on the good side. not the best quality but nice for 3 hrs flight. The crew were very friendly and helpful. Both flights left on time and arrived earlier than scheduled. Overall a good experience especially with a very good price as well.

### "service was exceptional"
Not Verified |  Dubai to London via Baku. The service was exceptional. We were pleasantly surprised at how nice it was, one of the friendliest airlines I have flown with. Everything was straight forward from the check in to the flight itself. I have never experienced such friendly and up beat staff for the whole flight.

### "All expectations exceeded"
Delightful flight from Moscow to Baku. The ground staff and cabin crew were all smiles and very professional. Excellent food onboard - wonderful selection of cheeses, great salad, superb meat and delicious desert. For the first time in months ate everything served on a plane. Entertainment was good for such a short flight - enjoyed a funny movie and several music channels. The flight was on time, seats comfortable, plane quite new and very clean. All expectations exceeded, hope to fly Azal again.

### "very impressed with the service"
Dubai to London via Baku with Azerbaijan Airlines. I was very impressed with the service and the whole experience in general. I would rate the airline 10/10, but 5/10 for airport staff at Baku who took 20 minutes to verify the visa!

### "service is really good"
Baku to Istanbul. Although they are economy class tickets, the food they give, and service they offer is really good. Although somewhat narrow chairs

### "The flight was great"
vBerlin to Tehran via Baku. The flight was great. Much more than what I expected. The food was delicious and served several times. Flight was on time. I was completely satisfied. The legroom was enough. Baku Heydar airport is very beautiful, modern, and comfortable. I had a 5 hour stop there, but was not tired and bored.

### "accepted he was wrong"
Baku to London. I was flying back home to London from Baku being 29-30 weeks pregnant. Read all airline policy about pregnant women restrictions in advance before buying tickets. When flew from London to Baku there was no issues and i signed a declaration on the way in. On the way back from Baku, was stopped by Airline representative dressed smartly and talking very politely without knowing the policy trying to tell me that my letter from midwife expired and i cannot use it anymore. He suggested to go to local hospital, do the scan and come back with fresh letter. I asked if that can be justified, he couldn't find it and obviously after more than an hour wait and stress (being pregnant), airline representative embarrassingly accepted he was wrong and let me fly. Unprofessional representative without any experience - poor service.

### "made a wonderful flight"
New York to Tehran via Baku. I arrived to check in desk at 7:30 am and explained what seat I desired but unfortunately the guy on front desk was in training and issued a boarding pass with uncomfortable seat which I didn’t expect at all. When I entered the plane and found out about my seat, I asked the crew to change! They said the flight is full and couldn’t change the seat - however a crew changed my seat and made everything comfortable and pleasant to destination. During the flight the crew worked hard and made a wonderful flight for all passengers.

### "airline is one of the worst"
Baku to Dubai. This airline is one of the worst in the world. They ruined the New Year holiday for our family. Our daughter was supposed to fly as an unaccompanied minor, she flew like this in August, so we knew the procedure. In August we arranged everything through our travel agent. This time they changed their rules, and didn't allow our agent to do everything, saying that her parents needed to be in Baku in person. A question, if her parents are in Baku in person why would we want to arrange the unaccompanied minor service? A very incompetent staff, I was on the phone with them since 10 o'clock in the morning until 5 in the afternoon, and not one could list me all the documents required. I've spoken to 6 different representatives and all 6 gave me different information. At the end of the day, we had to cancel her trip, because it seems impossible to obtain whatsoever information from the staff. Very rude, incompetent, not caring staff. Absolutely useless, only thinking about the company, and not caring about their clients at all. Before we also had very bad service from the air stewards, but this time they outperformed themselves. No rules, no clear procedures, nothing. Be careful, and do not fly with them! Also be careful when you do the online booking, or book the premium seats, because you will not have those, and there will not even be a booking of those! You will never be able to prove anything to them, they do not care about anything.

### "outstanding comfort and relaxation"
This was my 2nd trip on Azerbaijan Airlines, had a previous trip in December of 2015, New York JFK - Baku - Tbilisi - Baku - New York JFK. On all 4 legs of my trip it was a fantastic experience as both the Cockpit and Cabin crews did an outstanding job and provided an outstanding comfort and relaxation. Baku and Hayden Airport are world class with very friendly people, my family and I will always travel to Tbilisi via Baku all the time as we always get a fantastic flight with a very professional crew all around hands down. Thank You for a great experience again as we traveled on September 25 2017 and returned on October 28 2017. I encourage other family and friends to fly Azerbaijan Airlines whenever they travel towards Georgia and other points in the region.

### "a little lacklustre"
I had high expectations of Azerbaijan Airlines, after reading reviews on the internet. Unfortunately the overall experience was a little lackluster. The IFE did not work and the crew seemed to be moody and unwilling to do anything. When it came to food, although hot it did not taste very nice at all, I also put a 'wake me up' sticker on my seat which involved a member of the crew shoving my bag a few times in order to wake me up, then quite literally be rude and ask chicken or beef (limited food choice). Towards the rear of the aircraft all the arm rest seats were broken, this was annoying as the flight was not full and being a solo passenger I had a row to myself which I could not use. The return leg was marginally better, a full flight due to a cancellation the previous delay. The IFE was awfully outdated and very slow to load. I did manage to watch something which was good. The crew here were more attentive and actually seemed to enjoy bring on the flight. I would only recommend this airline if you prefer to flight direct to Azerbaijan.

### "I will recommend the airline"
Lviv to Baku. I bought ticket 5 months earlier and it was cheap price (84EUR return). When we arrived at Lviv airport we've realised that our flight is the last flight of a day, so airport wasn't busy at all. Boarding was quick and comfortable, cause there wasn't much passengers on this flight (more than half of seats was unoccupied). Flight took about 4 hours, and because of low occupancy I can lied on 3 seats in row, so I slept about 2,5h-3h of flight. Stewardesses were the most polite and friendly airplane stuff I've ever met. There were absolutly no problems with getting additional blankets or something to drink (free of curse). In flight entertainment system was headphones with sort of a MP3 player in armrest and TV screen for every 6 seats. It was surprising, because I've never seen on such short flights IFE in economy. The only one problem was that wifi didn't worked at all. We landed on time at Baku airport (about 4am). It not took much time to get out of terminal and enter bus that took us direcktly to city center. Interesting thing about this airline is that on wide body jets AZAL have strange numeration - on the left seats are ABC (like normally), but on the right they have letters JKL (where normally is DEF) - this made me a little bit confused (first time seen something like that). Ending, I honestly can say that I will recommend the airline to enybody - it is great quality for cheap price.

### "no smiles and not friendly"
New York to Dubai via Baku. It's good in general. Crew works hard, but no smiles and not friendly. Seats were comfortable but the cabin was very hot. I was getting hot and sweating. I asked the crew to turn the aircon down and they did at a minimum level, which was OK. They gave lots of food.

### "suitcases had zippers destroyed"
Kiev to New York via Baku. Worst airline I ever flew with. Flight attendants stressed, staff ran out of food twice during the same flight and the majority of ground staff is plainly rude. But the worse came when we picked up our luggage in JFK (it was a Monday at 9:30am): both suitcases had their zippers destroyed, which meant we couldn't use them any more. When we approached their ground staff at their check-in counter, they threw a fit. One lady yelled at us saying it was useless for us to complain, that it was the Baku airport security's fault. Really not the outcome we expected when we paid for our tickets. The manager gave us an email address for us to direct out claim. We sent pictures of the suitcases and our boarding passes, plus a detailed explanation of what occurred. It has been a week and no response whatsoever. Maybe it was just a way for him to get us to leave the check-in counter as soon as possible?

### "Seats were wide and comfortable"
Flew with Azerbaijan Airlines from Moscow to Baku and continued to Tbilisi. I had high expectations based on previous reviews. They were all met and exceeded. I had to call to AZAL office in Moscow to sort out a problem, which was resolved quickly and friendly by AZAL. At Moscow Vnukovo airport check-in staff gave tips how to pack luggage to minimize the excess baggage fee by using "two/three items become one"-method in packing service. Ticket desk lady of AZAL taking the excess fee was also friendly. The cabin crew was great, well groomed and cheerful. All spoke Azeri, Russian and English. Seats in economy class were wide and comfortable, seat pitch great (I am 195 cm). Punctual departure. Inflight entertainment had common TV-screens and additional selection of music channels. Earphones were provided. I liked their service concept. Free delicious Azeri-style hot meals with spices, salad and dessert, and beverages. Cabin crew was generous, proactive and were present in the cabin. Because the flight was operated as "low-cost" brand (AZAL has not experienced real low-cost) passengers had opportunity to buy Azeri wines, spirits and snacks for low prices 1-2€. Luggage was on the belt when we came to arrival hall. Baku Heydar Aliev Airport is superb - facilities are great. I have never seen an airline having so many staff at the airport as AZAL. Again check-in lady advised how to make excess baggage fee less. Nice and cheap Azeri tea ceremony at airport café. Boarding 45 minutes before departure, aircraft again comfortable. In-flight service same - free meals and beverages.

### "flight is consistently good"
I have started to fly with Azerbaijan Airlines over the last 2 years from Heathrow direct to Baku. The flight is consistently good with its cabin service, food and flight entertainment and you can even upgrade to business as boarding. The plane (Dreamliner) is always in very clean condition including the toilets. The only minor drawback for me is the the flight times to Baku (night flight) and 20 hour online check in prior to flight, otherwise I can highly recommend.

### "food quality is very good"
Baku to London Heathrow with Azerbaijan Airlines. Good VIP check-in service in Baku. Lounge is okay for a short stop - the decor is nice but it has little to offer over a longer period. Departure on-time - it was disappointing to have the older B767 on this flight rather than the better B787 which has flatbeds. However, the angled seat is more than adequate for an early evening flight and in any case I did not need to sleep. Good boarding service and service begins promptly after take-off. Food quality is very good and there is plenty of it - they even offer a plate of snacks before landing which I declined. Believe me you will not go hungry over the 6-hours. Staff seemed a bit inexperienced and some of the service is a little clumsy but they are friendly and enthusiastic. AVOD available and content is okay - certainly not the best I have seen but enough to keep most entertained for this short-ish flight. A few minutes late into Heathrow and a long taxi to Terminal 4 but overall a fine experience and would use again.

### "is the worst experience"
I booked my flight Dubai to Baku return some days back. 8 days before the flight to Baku, someone from the call center of this company called me telling my that my flight was cancelled without explaining the reason. According to aviation rules thay have to compensate me for this. The only thing they propose is to have a full refund. So I asked for a full refund requesting an official letter / mail for this cancelation. The only thing I received was an email stating that the refund is in process and I will get my money in 33 working days. Imagine this. I did several follow up calls and e-mails with no result. This is the worst experience.

### "good service onboard"
I was travelling from Heydar Aliyev Airport to Antalya. Was a able to book very cheap ticket in March for flight in July. Allowed cabin baggage was 10 kg - great for solo travelers. Comfortable flight, good service on-board, no delays and friendly staff. Recommend and will choose next time.

### "crew is polite and professional"
Baku to Istanbul. The tickets were far cheaper and flight times were more convenient (daytime, not too early in the morning). I did mobile check-in but I also used the counter for luggage check-in. On way forward I checked-in my luggage for 30USD fee (my original ticket did not have luggage included). I had an allowance of 10kg cabin luggage, so I chose not to check-in my luggage on the way back - 10kg is really plenty (especially for business trips). The plane was new, clean and comfortable. The crew is polite and professional. I did not expect to receive free meal, but this airline provides catering and for IST-baku leg I got a very tasty hot meal plus selection of alcoholic drinks. On the way back breakfast were provided. Coffee and tea service is also provided (only downside - there is no milk/cream for coffee). I would not hesitate to fly this airline again.

### "surprised how good this airline was"
Istanbul to Baku. I decided to fly Azerbaijan Airlines instead of another airline and I was very pleasantly surprised how good this airline was. I had 10kg cabin luggage allowance which was really plenty! The plane was new and clean. I also did not expect the free meal service, but it was excellent - hot meal with alcoholic drinks. Food was really fantastic. I would not hesitate to fly this airline again.

### "a very pleasant experience"
New York to Tel Aviv via Baku. A very pleasant experience. I originally selected Azerbaijan Airlines for its low price alone. I was not expecting a great experience and that was OK for the money saved. However, the flight was very pleasant overall. There were no delays, the planes were clean and well kept, the food was good and the air crews were friendly. Heydar Aliyev airport in Baku is beautiful. Clean and looks new. If you are willing to put up with a longer overall flight to Tel Aviv from NYC in exchange for a lower fare, Azerbaijan Airlines is a very good choice. The only downsides are no in-flight wifi and the entertainment selection could be more current. On the plus side, the 787 that they fly for the long haul to Baku does have individual USB ports to keep a phone charged so you could download a movie you want beforehand and watch it without your phone dying. The B757 that you transfer to to go from Baku to Tel Aviv is pretty basic but they do feed you and that leg of the trip is short.

### "very comfortable seats"
Tel Aviv to New York JFK via Baku return with Azerbaijan Airlines. Excellent service and also the plane. Kosher food is not special. Very comfortable seats on the Boeing 787 aircraft. Flight entertainment quite okay, flight attendants with excellent service. And wait in Baku pretty good.

### "food was tasty and pleasant"
This was my first time with Azerbaijan Airlines flying from Dubai to London Heathrow via Baku and I was pleasantly surprised. All the usual expectations of an airline on long haul, reclining seats, variety of TV channels / films (OK my wife's didn't work but she had her book anyway) etc. The food was tasty and pleasant. Staff, seemed helpful and friendly, but to date (5 weeks later) we are still no further sorting the APD refund that is due following the UK Chancellor's decision to scrap APDs for U16s (my son) and stating refunds from airlines would be refunded. Well Azerbaijan Airlines to date don't seem to want to know.

### "no clear explanation"
I came from Tbilisi to Baku with Azerbaijan Airlines on 16/2/2016 and my flight delayed 4 hour 20 minutes. There was no clear explanation about the delay and when I asked a staff member they told me that they did not know why there was a delay. They did not offer any food or drink during the long wait. Finally when they took us to plane I asked  for a coffee which they told me that I needed to pay for. An awful experience.

### "the seats are not lie-flat"
Azerbaijan Airlines from Baku to London. I was a little confused at Baku airport as I couldn't find any Business Class check in but the regular desks were quiet so no big deal. No priority baggage tag. The AZAL lounge in Baku is comfortable with self service bar and a few snacks but no hot food. The aircraft is quite new and Business Class was arranged 2-3-2. There were only about 8 passengers in the cabin on my flight. The crew were very attentive and friendly. I usually enjoy AZAL food but this flight's food was dry and not very tasty - though you do get a lot. Good bar service with lots of choice. The IFE on AZAL is pretty poor. I found there was lots of leg room but the seats are not lie-flat and by the time I got to London, I'd had enough! Flight arrived on time and the luggage was off the aircraft fairly quickly. All in all a good flight, though not exceptional, and much cheaper than BA's business class tickets on this route.

### "fly with them again"
Istanbul Ataturk to Baku with Azerbaijan Airlines. Despite having high prices AZAL offers good product especially on this route. AZAL does not allow you to purchase tickets online (with plastic cards) if it is not issued under passenger's name. They also stated "AZAL holds right to check authenticity of plastic cards during check in and/or boarding". In my case my parents wanted purchase this ticket but according to this they could not do it online. They personally went their office in Baku and purchased it. And AZAL added office fee. This is user unfriendly rule - Online check in was smooth. The flight was half empty so I could choose seat 12A. I had bicycle to transfer to Baku. According to AZAL's rules passengers can carry 1 piece sport equipment free of charge. In Ataturk airport staff seemed not to know this rule. I argued a bit then they take my mountain bike free of charge. It was handled gently which made me satisfied. The flight scheduled to depart at 12:20. This period used to be pretty busy at IST airport but we departed on time. The flight was operated by 5 years old Boeing 767-300er. The aircraft was showing its age but perfectly maintained. Seat was comfortable and legroom was ok for 2.5 hours flight. Seat next to me was empty which gave me more comfort. Cleanliness of lavatory was fine too. Crew distributed hot towels and headsets before take off. Complimentary food and drinks served onboard. Drink service started shortly after take off. They offered different soft drinks, biscuits and crackers. Lunch service followed. They did not have menus. Lunch consisted of buckwheat and meat balls with tomato sauce, fresh vegetable salad, 3 pieces of cheese, a piece of cake. Soft and alcoholic beverages also served. During lunch they also served tea with lemon. Usually Azerbaijani people prefer to have their dessert with tea. So very nice touch by AZAL! Inflight entertainment well below my expectations and general standards. Seat pocket items were just safety card and Azerbaijan Airlines magazine. The magazine mostly contained articles about BAKU2015 first European games which is not so fun for those who do not have any interest to sports just like me. I had a seat-back screen but it did not entertain me that much. IFE contained pretty old movies and screen was sometimes not sensitive at all. So IFE was the worst part of flying experience. We landed on time and I had my luggage shortly. I would recommend AZAL and would fly with them again. But I hope next time better cabin crew and IFE will be there.

### "pleasant service throughout"
Azerbaijan Airlines ran a very smooth service from London to Baku. Check-in was straightforward and they arranged for me to have an emergency exit seat with superb legroom. The staff were very friendly and provided pleasant service throughout, not disturbing me on an overnight flight. The drinks offering lacked good wine sadly, but this did not detract from the overall experience. The kosher meal I had was virtually a banquet, and the quality was excellent. We landed ahead of schedule and had a very smooth visa registration process in Baku. I was pleasantly impressed by the service and would gladly travel with AZAL again.

### "service was impressive"
I flew Azerbaijan Airlines from New York to Tel Aviv via Baku. Check in was a bit slow but friendly staff. Plane was full and it was my first time flying a 'Dreamliner'. The cabin crew (although they never smiled) were great and the service was impressive. The plane was comfortable with plenty of legroom and big windows. We were given an amenity kit which was a great little extra. Before our first hot meal was served we were given heated serviettes to freshen up with. A choice of chicken or beef was offered served with a salad, cake and a starter. It was lovely and fresh. Drinks of course and their wine was really nice. Then we were given a snack. Inflight entertainment was ok, good choice but older movies mostly. The screen was a good size, touch screen larger than average, with a charger for your phone. Leg room was good and I found the seat comfortable with a pillow and blanket. Duty free came round and was very cheap so good to note on that route, half the price of offers in JFK Airport. It was a 10.5 hour flight, and a couple of hours later we got a sandwich, and snacks again. After a few more hours we were served another hot meal. I had omelette and roast potatoes and veg. It was well presented with again rolls etc, and drinks. Smooth flight, and 3D tracking of route which was interactive which kept you well updated. Fantastic landing in Baku. Smaller connecting flight to Tel Aviv with very much the same great service and none of cabin crew minded how much you pressed for service on both flights.

### "a very good experience"
JFK to TLV via Baku with Azerbaijan Airlines was a very good experience. Nice plane (A340) with plenty of leg space. Comfortable and the kosher food was also very good. They have to work on the transfer process in Baku, because it takes so long for the security, and you have to go through this about 5 times before you get on your connecting flight.They should work on it.

### "seat, meal and staff were all great"
Flew Business class from Heathrow to Baku on one of Azerbaijan Airlines Boeing 787's. Check in, lounge (Gulf Air lounge T4 Heathrow), seat, meal and staff were all great. Only exception to this service is the limited inflight entertainment. Using this flight regularly, the IFE has not changed in months. Come on AZAL, everything else you do is up with the best I have flown, please get some new movies/TV programs.

### "staff are attentive and helpful"
Took the option of Azerbaijan Airlines basic business class which gives a good seat, reclining rather than lay flat, plenty of space, excellent food and drink service. Azerbaijan Airlines Boeing 787's have only been in service this year, and are very comfortable. The staff are attentive and helpful however, they need to take charge of passengers who just up and wander around the cabins from economy to business and just change seats, and those who get on, recline and drop the tables etc and leave them there for take off. Other than that, only "issue" is that having flown this route 4 times in the last 3 months the IFE menu has not changed and the choice of movies etc is very limited, hardly what I would expect on a new Boeing 787. ⚑ Azerbaijan Airlines Ranking

### Azerbaijan Airlines customer review
Both flights (PEK-GYD and GYD-LHR) were on new Boeing 787 with 3-3-3 seating. Beijing-Baku flight was full, and I was randomly allocated seat 21C on the front row of the rear section, so I had no trouble at all with legroom. Baku-London flight was about three-quarters empty, so I had plenty of space to lie across the row of three seats (23A). The seats themselves are fairly comfortable for economy class. The attendants on the first flight were particularly friendly and attentive, although I have no particular complaints about those on the second leg. The meals were very good on both flights, although I had requested a vegetarian meal (out of slight preference rather than insistence) which was not available. While this was not a huge disadvantage for me personally, it will have been a problem for more resolute vegetarians. My main criticism is the lack of content on the entertainment system. The interface works very well, but there was no interesting material to watch/listen to. I had a long layover in Baku, but the airport itself is outstanding: nice modern design, clean, efficient, sofas to sleep, and chargers. I did not buy anything at the airport, since I heard it would be overpriced, and I do not know if this is true or not.

### Azerbaijan Airlines customer review
AZAL offers a great meal and good seats. Today's flight was on an A319. The seats were big. The plane landed at the new terminal. Overall a nice flight experience!

### Azerbaijan Airlines customer review
I flew from JFK to Israel via Baku and had very positive experience with Azerbaijan Airlines. JFK-Baku the plane was a quarter full so I had 4 seats to myself. It was a new and clean airplane. I was served kosher food even though they say on their website it's not available on that flight. The airport in Baku is brand new, free wi-fi, again almost empty.

### Azerbaijan Airlines customer review
Flew from Ankara to Heathrow via Baku. 1st leg business 2nd leg economy. At Baku the check-in clerk asked us for extra money (for him) or else he would not be able to seat us together as the plane was full. We declined and were given seats nowhere near each other. However the plane was at least half empty including the seat next to my husband and 2 seats next to me! His actions did not reflect well on the airline which was otherwise very good. Staff on board very good but terminal staff not so. Have tried to complain to airline but keep getting sent round in circles.

### Azerbaijan Airlines customer review
Living in Baku Azerbaijan Airlines is often the cheapest and they code share with Qatar & Pegasus. Flights to My son and I flew from NYC USA to Aktau Kazakhstan and back on this airline. It was an excellent experience. The staff were professional no lost baggage issues. Meals were fantastic. I highly recommend using this airline.

### Azerbaijan Airlines customer review
Living in Baku Azerbaijan Airlines is often the cheapest and they code share with Qatar & Pegasus. Flights to Dubai quick and easy - although they seam to gate at the furthest gate in Dubai. It usually takes 2 hours to go through customs. There is always some kind of hot meal with local cheese. They usually have wine but not other alcohol. Flying to Tbilisi you are sometimes lucky and are put on the Qatar flight that flies Doha-Baku-Tbilisi. When using AZAL to connect to Pegasus (a large low cost carrier out of Istanbul) run to the transfer desk as AZAL does not ticket you through and everyone on the plane will need a transfer ticket. Also be aware that when you come back to Baku you will have to wait at the AZAL desk. People are seldom connecting to AZAL and on both occasions I have been the only one waiting at the transfer desk with no personnel for about 20 minutes. Don't plan any short connections as AZAL will not ticket you through on Pegasus. I have tried multiple times to register for their frequent flyer program online but it makes little sense and I have been unable to figure it out. You fly AZAL because it is usually direct and less expensive. I would hesitate to take them on a long haul flight. They are adding new planes and the new airport is incredible.

Passengers' comfort should be the priority. I found on many occasions too many distractions from other passengers family members or friends visiting the business class section frequently. There should be a certain protocol like on all other airlines I have taken whereby visits to business class or the first class cabin are very restricted. I observed a certain irritation and anxiety with many passengers during my last trip when we had children running into the cabins from the other cabin and family members greeting chatting openly to friends or acquaintances in the business class cabin throughout the journey. Most business travellers pay a premium to get their rest or sleep and the constant movement within the cabin is most disturbing. The cabin crew needs to be given more authority to maintain it. Otherwise a very good Airline with great potential.

IST-GYD-IST on B767 very nice and spacious aircraft for such a short flight of 2hrs 40mins. Good selection of food 3 choices of veal / chicken / fish. Professional (I would not say friendly) and helpful staff. Nice IFE with good selection but a little outdated. On the return (morning) flight was fully booked. Breakfast had 3 selections of omelette / sausages / pancakes. Good experience but limited destinations of the airline. I would use them if they offer the destination that I would want. Soon they will start Beijing with A340-500.

DXB-GYD on AZAL 757. An old and well used aircraft but perfectly comfortable for 2.20 flight. Crew very friendly. Only downside was the on board food which wasn't good at all but I had fairly low expectations and ate in the airport before the flight so this wasn't a problem. I wouldn't actively seek out an AZAL flight over other airlines but equally if they were the best option I wouldn't have any issues flying with them again.

I fly frequently London-Baku-London Baku-Ankara-Baku and find AZAL very comfortable and a fair price in comparison with BMI. Cabin crew friendly business class service and overall experience is very good. Flights are mostly carried on times and with great professionalism from the pilots. I'll continue using AZAL in future.

We booked the flight via Air France as a codeshare. For some reason we were not in the Azal system. While the staff were kind it took a while to resolve this and there were some moments where we weren't sure we would be allowed on the flight. Azal needs to work on their codeshare process with Air France. Once our problem was resolved and our boarding passes issued everything was great. Kind cabin crew very clean plane and meals served onboard.

We flew between Paris and Baku return. The service was excellent. The food (hot lunch on the way to Baku and hot breakfast on the way back to Paris) very good to excellent much better than on North American airlines. It was our first time on this airline and I would fly them again.

Baku to Tehran and return. The first flight was a pretty old ATR-72 which looked quite scary from outside. Inside was not bad and relatively comfortable. The flight was pleasant and on time service on board was correct. The return leg was very unpleasant. The flight was supposed to leave at 2:20 am but due to the late arrival of the aircraft from Baku it was delayed of 1hr. Then when the moment to board came we didn't have any news and the Azerbaijan Airlines ground staff disappeared. Just after 1 more hour a staff member was found by the other passenger and was obliged to give a public statement just in Farsi announcing that due to heavy fog in Baku the plane was delayed without indicating the exact departure time. As I'm Italian I could just get this information from another fellow passenger who translated to me. At 7am the mob almost attacked an Azerbaijan Airlines staff member and obliged him to give some news : he made a phone call and after 10 minutes the we suddenly started to board. Finally we left at 8pm and the flight with an A319 went fairly well. Bad weather is a standard inconvenience and flying with fog is not safe but the behaviour of Azerbaijan Airlines was simply not acceptable. We were all left for hours without any information any drink and any apologize.

LHR-GYD. If travelling business ask to be checked into row 1 or 2 - rows 3 onwards are sometimes used for business class but have ordinary economy seats. Generous bar large dinner with typically Azerbaijan cuisine. Cheerful attentive flight attendants. The reverse journey (LHR-GYD) is overnight.

I have flown AZAL from both Paris and London to Baku but mainly from Gatwick as it was convenient for me. I flew Business class for approx 2 years and found inflight service was normally very good but preferred the old 757's to the new Airbus as the old aircraft had individual wide seats whereas the newer 757's were 3 economy seats divided into 2. My only criticisim would be at the main AZAL office in Baku where I had to chase up my frequent flyer Silver Card - which I still do not have. I also lost my wallet with the original blue card and when reporting it for a replacement AZAL "fined" me 25% on my air miles. Security at Baku was always thorough but fair. I also used BA and BMI to Baku but would recommend AZAL as they are normally cheaper and the Baku flight had plenty of seats from Gatwick to Baku.

Tupolev 134 used from Baku to Nkhchivan interior was plastic - the curtains hung with wires in front of the windows. The air conditioning poured steam out of the ventilation. The backrests of my seat was damaged. The table had to be held in place because the fastening to the seat in front of me was damaged. The landing was careful and there was free water served during the long ground stay before we got in the air.

LHR to Tehran via Baku. Planes were clean and appeared newish and food mostly good although sandwiches dry and dull. Service was fair at best but would fly Azerbaijan again as it was the cheapest.

### Azerbaijan Airlines customer review
Tbilisi-Baku and Baku-Tbilisi with ATR (prop) aircraft. Most days they have two flights in each direction one on the ATRs and one on 737s. The ATR plane was good clean fixtures and toilets in fine shape. Inflight service for these short hops consisted of small sandwiches (think a small round sliced bun with sliced chicken breast and mayo inside) plus drinks. Passengers all ordered non- alcoholic drinks but I assume alcoholic drinks would have been available. The flight attendants were professional and polite though not bubbly-friendly. Crew all spoke English well. The return GYD-TBS flight had a friendlier smiling flight attendant. Overall I’d say the airline gave quite a good service.

My worst flying experience in 11 years of former Soviet Union travel. On January 13 2008 the airport in Baku was closed because the airport is not equipped with any modern snow cleaning equipment. Personnel checking us in in Tblissi in Georgia without telling us anything with a delay of 7 hours in order to not let us return the tickets and book an alternative route through Kiev. No food no drinks no apologizing. Arriving in Baku after midnight no information whatsoever a crowded airport without any modern facilities. No airport representative ever turned up. No food no drinks no apologizing. Finally with a delay of another 17 hours check-in at the departure lounge we were forced to wait for 2 hours without being allowed to go out and use the toilet. Aggressive unfriendly personnel at the airport. The aircraft was covered with snow no cleaning equipment was at hand to clean away the snow from the top of the aircraft. Other passengers told us they already had similar experiences when flying from Moscow through Baku. Stay away from Azerbaijan airlines if you can.

Moscow (DME) to Baku and it was a great flight. The plane was newer than many I've been on in the US and very clean and comfortable. The service was good even in economy class and food was generous and quite tasty. The next flight Baku to Tblisi was also comfortable with excellent cabin crew.

Dubai to Baku & return. The plane was an A320. It was full as usual. Food & service were basic but acceptable. It is important to note that economy passengers can only have 20 kgs booked luggage and they weigh your hand luggage (nothing over 10 kgs). Excess baggage charge on the DUB- Baku was quite expensive. On the return flight I was offered two ways to pay the charge - the fast way (in cash to the nice check in man - $20 which he pocketed) or the slow way by going to the excess baggage counter & paying $50. I always choose the fast way when in the old Soviet republics.

I have flown AZAL two times from Moscow - Baku - Moscow. The plane was clean and the crew friendly and helpful. Food was good - not very much different from other airline food. No delays everything went smooth.

### Azerbaijan Airlines customer review
I flew Azerbaijan Airlines from Tel Aviv to Baku and it was my worst flight experience ever. It could not be worse. The cabin attendants did not know very simple things about the better service and airplane crew. The food was awful only half-cup drinks the smell from the cabin reminded the one from a public lavatories in the University of Baku. The seats of the plane were nasty and dirty. The crew was rude and during the flight never announced basic information about the flight. Their English was terrible. In a word you easily get lost in the Azerbaijan Airlines flights!

### Azerbaijan Airlines customer review
My first trip with Azerbaijan Airlines was second to none! I experienced warmth from the crew added with an ease of confidence and individuality totaling unique!

### Azerbaijan Airlines customer review
I flew with the airline to and from Baku in early December 2004 and was pleasantly suprised. The comfort food service and entertainment was superior to many major airlines. The aircraft was a 757 and on time both journeys. I have no complaints only praise for value enjoyable flights.

### Azerbaijan Airlines customer review
I have used Azerbaijan Airlines a number of times between Istanbul to London Gatwick; the fares are consistently cheaper than for other airlines (even in busy times it is possible to get a return flight from Istanbul to London for less than $300) and the flights are always on time. They also leave at convenient times. The airline uses a Boeing 757 on these flights with an in-flight film (more than on Turkish Airlines or BA on the same route). The comfort and food are satisfactory (it is probably time for the cabin to be spruced up) and the service is very good with drinks provided regularly throughout the flight. I would recommend this airline especially those who might be dubious about flying on an airline from a former Soviet republic.

### Azerbaijan Airlines customer review
The gentleman in their London office I dealt with on the phone when making the booking was extremely helpful in explaining the various options to me. On the security front I was comfortable as x-rays and sniffer dogs were employed at the departure gate. Both flights departed and arrived on time and were comfortable. The food especially on the return flight was more than passable. The onboard service was excellent - nothing too much trouble for the cabin crew - even when dealing with the incessant demands of the "spoilt brat" male passenger in front of me who I would happily have throttled. These were the most pleasant flights I have made in years.

What a rickety airline - I flew it twice in December 2003 and thought we were going to fall out of the sky. The flight from Baku to Kabul was on one of their typical Russian built aircraft that creaked and groaned the whole way. The return flight was not much better. At Kabul Airport we literally had to load our bags from a pile of luggage just dumped on the tarmac - it was total chaos. Had it not come at the end of a tough visit to Afghanistan it would have been scary - the guy in the cargo hold was just flipping bags everywhere with no regard for weight distribution - I hope I never have to fly this airline again.

### Azerbaijan Airlines customer review
I flew in April/May 2003 and I must agree with the gentleman from 2002 - the service was excellent and the food wasn't half bad for airline food. The plane I flew was a little older than most American-owned planes I have been on - but it was well maintained. The number of flight attendants was the biggest surprise for me - probably 10 - compared to a comparable U.S. flight of 4. And they are definitely attentive. When I flew there was a film on how to go through customs at the Baku Airport (in English) so that was a great help to me.

### Azerbaijan Airlines customer review
I sat down and waited for about 45 minutes until the crew announced they are starting to board the aircraft. Oh boy" I said to myself and "the journey of your life is beginning" I thought to myself. I must have been judging it before I even boarded the plane which by the way had one of the cleanest salons I have ever seen. But their professional level service and quality shocked me since it was so much better of what anyone would have expected from a top airline. I mean a small Airline company of a small Eastern European country has reserved a spot in my top 5 air travel experiences. I wanted to make sure that I wasn't focusing on myself and was evaluating my opinions based on what I have been seeing around me. The crew didn't seem make a difference between passengers. Everyone seemed to be equally important whether they were French Azeri English American or Russian. I asked their hostesses for a bottle of water and some wine several times and I would get the same answer: "Of course! When they were serving food I wasn't sure what they were serving. The hostess gave me a natural smile and showed me the samples of servings and explained what was in them. In major airlines that I have flown the crew would be as robotic as a person can get totally dehumanized. I felt culture in that although watching an original Hollywood movie with Turkish subtitles felt kind of odd. They must have understood one of them if not both. I know from my experience with airlines that no matter how big they get the only way to judge them stays the same - Quality of service (including security and assistance) is what counts.
