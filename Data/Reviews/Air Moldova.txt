### "cancelled the flight with 4 days notice"
Not Verified |  Do not book with this airline. Booked to go to Baku for the f1. They cancelled the flight with 4 days notice, offered no alternative. so was forced to book another flight at a much higher cost to get to Baku. Air Moldova know they cannot run their flight schedule, but sell tickets anyway. They then cancel with late notice, and do not offer any refunds. I have called, emailed, tweeted, FB messaged etc, no reply. This is a very simple scam, and very common, beware and do not use them.

### "€70 penalty to take cash refund"
Not Verified |  Air Moldova cancelled my flight 3 days after taking money out of account. I found it really difficult to get anyone to engage with me and eventually they offered me a voucher to the ticket price. I refused this as I do not intend to use the airline ever again. they said there is a '€70 penalty' to take cash refund so I would only receive €6!

### "decided not to let me board"
I tried to fly from Istanbul to Lisbon as I received a job offer. I had in hands: house contract, work contract signed from both parties, invitation letter from the company and even a document from the Portuguese Consulate authorizing my arrival. But yet, they have decided not to let me board with the excuse I need a visa. I am Brazilian, I don't need a visa anywhere in Europe, let alone Portugal. I've waited for about 4 hours until they decide to officially not let me board. The counter guy was absurdly unprofessional. The manager wasn't so bad. But then they tell me I need to contact an email or call some weird number that never picked up. And No one ever replied to my email attempts. I called the offices in Istanbul, Lisbon and Chisinau and none of them helped with anything. 230 euros on the trash. So trust me: they will coast you more than any other more expensive but trust able ticket.

### "they will never refund you"
Don't buy a ticket with them, they cancelled my flight a week before my travel offering me to fly 4 days later. I asked for a refund and they told me that they would refund 27 euro out of 112 euro (wonder why only 27 euro), anyway they never refunded me anything. Sent them at least 50 emails, they never replied and tried to call them, same problem never answering the phone. I have been waiting 1h on the phone and no one never answered. Don't buy a ticket with them. No help at all and no customer service and the worst is that they will never refund you.

### "I will never book them again"
Not Verified |  
Prior to flight it was a struggle to book mobility assistance for my half blind mum. Eventually I booked it and received confirmation. No assistance was provided in Chisinau for her to catch connecting flight with only 40 min to do it. She struggled on her own. I will never book them again.

### "I had the worst experience"
Tel Aviv to Chisinau. They can cancel your flight any time, and if you will ask for a refund they will not accept. Try to avoid them, they only care for money. I had the worst experience with them, I waited at the airport 13 hours to take another flight instead. I will never ever fly will them again.

### "not possible to change booking"
Not Verified |  Very inflexible in giving me the dates I wanted to reschedule because of the Coronavirus pandemic, when I reschedule the dates I wanted to they gave me the dates I didn’t want to go, and I ask them for the dates I wanted and they said it was not possible for me to change the booking for those dates.

### "thanks to the staff"
Not Verified |  Chisenau was our layover stop between London and Krasnodar and our plane with Air Moldova was delayed for a substantial amount of time, leaving us worried that we would miss our next flight. However, we were able to board our plane to Krasnodar, thanks to the staff at Air Moldova. Knowing that we, along with a couple of other passengers, were getting close to missing our next plane, the cabin staff ensured that we were the first to disembark the plane. Once at the Chisenau airport, staff took us directly to our next plane, which would have taken us much longer if the kind staff had not taken us via the quickest route. Without them, we would have definitely missed our flight.

### "Awful customer service"
Chisinau to Paris. Awful customer service! Because the autofill on the pc had a mistake in my name and they told me that the correction is €90 that I understand but the lady got moody and said that there are no more seats. If i want to leave magically they will find an empty seat if i pay the full price ticket €250, and they gave me the same seat that i reserved at the beginning. I literally saw in my ticket after they printed it that they charged me for the name correction €90 and the charged me for an upgrade that I didn’t ask €160 - because otherwise they will not allow me to board.

### "the problem was solved within minutes"
Moscow Domodedovo to Chisinau. I've been using services of Air Moldova already for 3 years and I have a very positive impression. Airplanes are in good condition, come on time and the service is great. Especially, I would like to point out excellent work of online help service of Online Booking. I made a mistake choosing the date of flight and noticed it only after order has been placed. The operator gave me a fast reply to my email and was very friendly and helpful, so we could correct the date to the right one. So the problem was solved within minutes. Excellent work! Totally recommend to use this airline.

### "Horrible, lousy airline"
Dublin to Istanbul via Chisinau. Horrible, lousy airline. Will never travel with them again. Massive delays and they cancelled my ticket that I had paid for and left me stranded in Istanbul. Still in it as I write this. Trying to get home.

### "horrible customer service"
Chisinau to Frankfurt. I bought a ticket allowing hand luggage and a bag. I have been asked at the check-in to take out 700grams from my hand luggage (it was 8.7kg, exceeding 700grams) and for the my bag they said I have to change from backpack to purse. Crazy strange rules and horrible customer service. I took 700grams out of my hand carry in luggage and took put all my staff from my backpack and put them in my purse. Altogether it has to weight probably 2kg and this created lots of inconvenience. In all other countries I flew in or flew from, I have never had this kind of situations.The experience is definitely bad, especially the staff just repeating "these are the company rules". So for those travelling with Air Moldova from Chisinau be careful to not exceed the weight and have the right type of luggage. I would recommend to call them in advance prior to your flight and ask very specific questions. Otherwise you may have to leave luggage at airport especially if you are not living in Moldova or returning there. If I could, I would avoid flying with this company.

### "airline is so abysmally bad"
Frankfurt to Chisinau. This airline is so abysmally bad that I can’t believe that it exists! I have a high tolerance for poor service and run-down planes, having flown in many third world countries, but Air Moldova takes the cake. Rude service - I was late in arriving at the gate thanks to a delay (not my fault) at Frankfurt security. The gate agent - apparently incensed that she had to hold the plane for me - literally started shouting at me when I approached and refused to even let me quickly pack my bags (which I had to grab of the belt at security without repacking In order to run to the gate) before I had to go down the stairs to the bus. When I say shouting, I mean it. She went beyond just poor customer service to literally hostile customer service as she was yelling “Boarding pass. Run down planes - The plane seats were torn and the plastic was actually yellowing. The plane was a 737-500 and thus had to be at least 20 years old. Poor safety measures - There was no safety card  in English. Forget that, it was not even in Romanian (the native language) or Russian. It was in Armenian. Why? Because they apparently leased the plane from an Armenian carrier and couldn’t even be bothered to swap out the safety cards. This strikes me as a major breach in safety protocol.

### "decent, professional airline"
Stansted to Chișinău. Pros: friendly and helpful staff, quick, easy check-in at airport, free hold baggage and generous cabin baggage, tasty & fresh complimentary food and wine on-board. All far better than I expected. Cons: plane was over an hour late - although the staff were very apologetic. I think their timetables simply aren't robust enough, don't have enough slack time, and airport turn-around not sufficiently efficient. Our flight was a late evening flight, and having looked at their flight history in general the earlier in the day the flight is, the more reliable it seems to be. It's also relatively expensive, but then there's not much competition on flights to Chișinău from London! Overall: This is a decent, professional airline that looks after you well. But it has some scheduling issues to sort out to improve punctuality.

### "professional and prompt"
Chisinau to Brussels. Bought an Economy Basic ticket for a family member but at the last minute had to suspend it due to emergency situation. It ended up being that we no longer needed ticket suspension and it was restored via emails with customer service. There was no extra charge and customer service representatives were very professional and prompt in their response. Thank you!

### "is very unprofessional"
Stansted to Chisinau. Rescheduled flight with no prior notice. Very poor ground team management. Flight was delayed on 12th of July from 14:40 to 21:10 without any notice provided prior my arrival to the Stansted airport on the day at 12:30pm. Was in contact with customer service on the 12th of July 1pm and was told "my only option was wait", which is very unprofessional as the overall waiting time is now over 6 hours! At this stage the airline has to offer refreshments and phone calls for every 2 hours of delay, in addition to a full refund that I am legally entitled to. Yet I am told my only option is wait!

### "Very badly organized company"
Moskow to Florence via Chisinau. They changed twice the flight to my wife and just few days before the departure and in the airport of Chisinau they didn't provide the assistance due according to the regulations. Very badly organized company! It's very hard to communicate with them.

### "surprised by the quality of service"
Paris to Chisinau. I have maybe flown 10 times with Air Moldova. I was surprised by the quality of service provided by such a small operator, and my trips with them have always been very pleasant. Lately, to avoid taxes, they decided to switch from Paris Charles De Gaulle to Paris Beauvais airport. At first, I was a bit disappointed, because it seems to me less easy to fly from Beauvais, but after few tries, I got to understand that there is no huge difference reaching Beauvais or Charles de Gaulle airports when you live far from Paris. I highly recommend Air Moldova.

### "they remain silent"
Air Moldova are hiding behind 'flight cancelled for safety reasons' to avoid delay compensation for a faulty engine leading to a 3 day delay which requires compensation to be paid under UK law. Despite numerous emails they remain silent on this matter.

### "my ticket cost very little"
I flew Air Moldova from Chisinau to Vienna. Flight left and landed on-time. Onboard service consisted of 2 large and tasty sandwiches, accompanied by drinks (including alcoholic, which are rare on some European airlines). The seats were comfortable, plane was clean and the cabin crew were kind and helpful. My ticket cost very little.

### Air Moldova customer review
After a 3 day delay my replacement flight was still late departing and arriving. In flight meal was a sandwich cheese and salami, no options, a small alcoholic drink and good range of juices and tea/coffee. Seating was cramped - made worse than Ryanair as seats recline, it then depends on how considerate passengers are in front of you.

### Air Moldova customer review
I checked in quickly and was airside for my 08.20 departure on Saturday. The boards then showed a 70 min delay and some while after showed gate opening in 905mins and then 835mins. I found an Air Moldova staff member and was taken landside and explained to that the flight was tech and rescheduled for 21.30. Given meal vouchers and rooms at Radisson but at 15.00 told flight was cancelled. Recovered my bag by 16.30. I am now rebooked for Tuesday. Have to say staff were polite and helpful but in the dark and they were not pleased with late cancellation as rerouting customers late in the day via Heathrow was going to be a problem. Wait and see what Tuesday brings.

### Air Moldova customer review
On June 9 2015 my wife and I were returning after a Business trip in Chisinau on flight 9U 895. We had purchased a direct flight from Chisinau to Barcelona. Once boarded we we were told that the flight was going to make a stopover in Lisbon. A surprise because at check in no one had informed us. The captain of the plane did not inform us and apologized over the intercom that the plane had to make a stopover in Lisbon. During the trip from Chisinau to Lisbon the crew gave us a sandwich for lunch and a drink. The stopover in Lisbon was nearly two hours, the crew did not give us anything to drink. On the way from Lisbon to Barcelona the crew did not give us anything to eat, and they did not have any still drinking water. We arrived in Barcelona with a 4 hour delay and we had to wait an hour to collect our bags.

### Air Moldova customer review
I very recently flew from Frankfurt to Chisinau and I was once again extremely pleased with all aspects of the flight! My flight was operated by an Airbus A320 and was fully packed with passengers. The seats were very comfortable a warm breakfast was served excellent both in quantity and quality! The aircraft however lacked in-flight entertainment. Flight attendants seem to have significantly improved their command of the English language and are also very kind and helpful! The plane took off and landed on-time. The Captain of the flight kept us informed about flight conditions several times throughout the journey. Finally I would definitely recommend flying Air Moldova.

### Air Moldova customer review
Moscow - Chisinau - Rome and back. I chose Air Moldova because of the low price and very good connections. Unfortunately all flights were delayed (from 30 minutes to 2 hours) with no apparent explanation or apologies. The connection in Chisinau was about 1 hour 20 minutes both times but due to delays we had to practically run to get on the next plane. The Chisinau Airport was fine though much better for short transit that some of the other world airports. The airplanes are really old (I could see duct tape in several places) seats are very tightly packed and also falling apart - I could not recline my seat because the button fell inside the armrest. Inflight meal consisted of a cheese bun which was okay but not sufficient at all. I have to say that wine was served which was quite good and certainly a plus. Crew seemed surly and disinterested although this varied from flight to flight. The biggest problem is on the way back my luggage did not arrive to Moscow. Would I fly Air Moldova again? Maybe if the price is really low (it usually is) but I will keep everything in my cabin luggage.

### Air Moldova customer review
KIV-OTP on an old but presentable Em120. Flight was on time with good service (sandwich) for the short 1 hour flight. Steward was very friendly speaking good English. We were lucky that day only the flights with Em120 and Em190 were on time. Flights with A320 had 5 to 7 hours delays.

### Air Moldova customer review
STN-KIV-STN by Airbus 320. Flight was over two hours late leaving Stansted around 20 minutes late leaving Chisinau. Check in was fine. The really bad aspect of the flights was the lack of leg room. Absolutely awful. The inflight 'meal' was a cheese stuffed pastry. Not nice. Staff were fairly friendly but hadn't yet caught up with real customer service. If you over about 1.60 metres tall you will never walk again.

### Air Moldova customer review
FRA-KIV-OTP with Air Moldova. The first leg was operated by an Embraer 190 aircraft. Flight attendants were attentive throughout both flights. On the first leg the meal included a choice between chicken or beef which was fantastic. On the second flight a warm chocolate croissant was offered for the 45-minute hop. Second leg was an Embraer 120 aircraft which made the second leg of my trip entertaining. I was impressed by the quality of both flights will fly them again!

### Air Moldova customer review
KBP-KIV. The check-in at Air Moldova was very quick as there was no line. Baggage weight allowances were very strict since we were flying on a small 30 seater Embraer 120 Brasilia. Onboard we were offered complimentary drinks and croissants and even though the plane was small the seats were very reasonable. The flight was kind of shaky but it made the plane ride down to Chisinau very fun. We promptly received our baggage after clearing customs. In conclusion Air Moldova is a fantastic airline!

### Air Moldova customer review
LGW-KIV on Embraer 190. Departed on time and arrived a little early. FA's were polite and efficient. Catering was a sandwich and a choice of Hot drinks Soft drinks and Moldovan Wine. No IFE but not a problem on a 3hr flight. Only strange aspects were the very stocked duty free trolley coming through the plane but with absolutely no price lists or catalogues so I had no idea what they were selling and that the cockpit messages to staff were in Romanian which surprised me as most airlines now do them in English. Just one quick note be prepared to be locked in the airport for a while. My luggage actually came through first but when I cleared customs and headed for the exit I could see my friends waiting for me but the doors taking me landside were locked after much rattling around 10 mins later a staff member came and pressed the button to let us out! I would gladly fly with them again and the direct flight makes this the best option on this route.

### Air Moldova customer review
KIV-FRA-KIV. The plane was an Embraer 190 in spotless condition. Tasty hot meals both ways and a good selection of alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages. Flights departed and landed on time. Connecting luggage arrived safely. Gate staff friendly and courteous. Onboard flight attendants looked a bit tired and could smile more.

### Air Moldova customer review
Was scheduled to fly IST-KIV on June 12. Learned 5 days before the flight that the service on that day was cancelled. Was offered a seat on the next day's flight transfer from/to airport and free hotel accommodation. A big thanks to the Air Moldova representative in Istanbul Sinan who was super helpful in arranging the details of my overnight stay in Istanbul. He accompanied me to the hotel met me at the airport the next day and was extremely friendly throughout my dealings with Air Moldova. Onboard the service consisted of a cold meal and a selection of alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks. FAs could learn to smile more. Plane a new spotless Embraer 190 with comfortable pitch and leather seats.

### Air Moldova customer review
VIE to KIV. The experience was quite odd like going back into the Soviet days as they were using a Yak-40 on the flight. Staff friendly and relatively professional although it felt almost like a charter flight. The meal was quite good and flight was on time. The cabin layout was really bizarre with something looking like a couch near the front of the plane and little leg room in my seat. The fact that they didn't de-ice the plane (it was snowing hard at takeoff) freaked me out a bit too. Not sure if they're still using the Yak-40 but if you happen to get on this one it's certainly a unique experience if you're up for it.

### Air Moldova customer review
OTP-KIV-IST return. OTP-KIV canceled due to fog instead put on the TK service to IST. For the IST-KIV on well maintained Embraer 190 with friendly and professional FAs. KIV-OTP delayed 1.5 hours but they kept passengers informed. Boarding was a bit chaotic as they could not figure which plane should depart first. They used a fairly old but clean A320-200 and staff were nice. For the price paid attentive service and helpful staff.

### Air Moldova customer review
Business class Moscow to Chisinau. I was the only business class passenger. Good condition A320. Flight was on time FA was smart pretty smiling and hospitable. Cabin service was fine - a full breakfast served and service was attentive. I was pleasantly surprised.

### Air Moldova customer review
OTP-KIV return on new Embraer 190. The flight was quick and the little snack was more than ok. Flight Attendants were only interested in some passengers and didn't really care at all for the others. I felt sort of unsafe as no particular attention was brought to passengers calling on cellphone or using electronic devices during take off and landing! My return trip was with the small Embraer 120 for KIV-OTP flight. This very old little plane of 30 seats only was comfy and I felt safe. The single cabin crew who was working was smiling kind and hospitality was great. We left and arrived on time.

### Air Moldova customer review
OTP-KIV Embraer 120 Economy Class. The airplane is old and uncomfortable. Whilst waiting in Bucharest had to approach the information desk and ask for explanations with regard to the late opening of the check-in counter. In fact with 20 minutes before scheduled departure the check-in hadn't opened. No announcements or apologies from the airline staff. Tarom-operated flights on this route are a better alternative. The only good thing about this flight was the responsive attitude of the FA on board. Otherwise Air Moldova needs to get its grip together if they want to retain customers.

### Air Moldova customer review
Flew Air Moldova on the Chisinau - London Stansted route. Check-in efficient and quick boarding. The Airbus 320 was in good condition and crew very welcoming. Once on-board offered a cold meal and one round of drinks. Air Moldova makes a technical stop in Paris to drop-off and pick-up passengers on this route. Given that total flight time to London including the stop in Paris is over 5 hours I think it does make sense to serve a hot meal and at least another round of drinks. I guess this was the only disappointment with Air Moldova.

### Air Moldova customer review
Route FRA-KIV-FRA. First flight was an unmarked MD operated by SkyWings. Service and food were average at best. Return flight turned into quite a nightmare mostly for passengers who had a connection flight from Frankfurt to another city. The flight was scheduled at 0805 first postponed to 0900 then to 1000 and finally to 1230. In the end our flight took off at 1340 nearly eight hours late. There was hardly a word of excuse except a roll and a bottle of water handed to each passenger in the departure area.

### Air Moldova customer review
FRA-KIV-FRA. This route is now run by an old MD-82 leased from Sky Wings (Greece). This plane has no markings and my seat had no tray table. Parking is at the furthest stand from the terminal so you will have a very long ride to/from Terminal 2. FRA-KIV meal was OK as was the service. KIV-FRA breakfast was great. No in-flight entertainment either way.

### Air Moldova customer review
I'd give it a solid average rating. It seems you can never get a uniform service though; sometimes you can buy a bottle of wine other times you are told wine is not sold or available or wine is served with the meal and sometimes there is none. The flight attendants are perfunctorily friendly something expected from a former communist mentality (customer service-wise). Air Moldova offers the cheapest airfare I have found and the only direct flight from Frankfurt.

### Air Moldova customer review
KIV-FRA-KIV. The airline currently uses A320-200 former Ansett Australia airplanes. Service was average. Food pretty simple and included sliced ham and cheese a bun and salad tea or coffee and dessert. Service average but the good part is the Moldovan red wine they serve on board! Flight attendants friendly but disappeared soon after the empty food trays were collected. Air Moldova is the only non-stop option between Chisinau and Frankurt and in terms of price much cheaper compared to other Air Moldova routes.

### Air Moldova customer review
I used to regularly fly Air Moldova and could see a huge improvement for the last years. The service on flights to Western Europe was always rather very good. Even if in the beginning nothing was different from a regular Aeroflot plane commodities (Tupolev 134) the air hostesses were very attentive and tried their best (speaking English as well as Russian and Romanian). Recently they got Airbus 320 and the flight is a real pleasure. Air Moldova has added lately their entertainment TV program in flight. That is also a change to the horrible comedy Russian shows they used to air before.
