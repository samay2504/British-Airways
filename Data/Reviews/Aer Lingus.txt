### “terrible customer service”
Not Verified | Absolutely terrible customer service. Tried to upgrade from economy to business. Impossible to reach a person who could help, let phone ring for 52 minutes and gave up. Chat was just as bad as the AI could not help. Fortunately will never have to fly them again.

### "no agreed refund in record"
I and my wife flew Aer Lingus from Toronto via Dublin to Berlin to visit my son. After arrival, we decided to stay longer and needed to change return flight date. We went on Aer Lingus website to change return flight. Unfortunately they only allow to change both outbound and return flights together, not just the return flight only. We googled to find their only contact being a telephone number at Berlin Airport. Called, but nobody answered. On next day, My son told us that, through quite an effort on previous night, he was able to get Aer Lingus to have our return flight changed. I checked my credit card account and noted that Aer Lingus had already withdrawn the charged money. The amount was significantly higher than I expected. Now my new air fare becomes 1.52 times of my original. Sensed something was wrong, I went on Aer Lingus website to practice changing flight again. Comparing their posted price for the same return date against my original ticket, the actual cost for price difference should be only 60% of the amount they charged. The other 40% was actually the price difference for the outbound flight which has already completed (you can’t change a flight you have already flown). One day later we found out we can call Aer Lingus in Dublin from Berlin. We called and disputed the overcharge. Their agent went to consult her management and came back to inform that they agreed to refund. We were told to wait for email from Aer Lingus in one to two weeks. After two weeks, we called again to inquire status. Different agent answered still on queue. Asked to wait for five more days to one week. On the third call, agent claimed that there was no agreed refund in record. All that agent could do was to escalate my case to higher level and wait. After returned Toronto, called fifth time. No progress. Gave up calling since. After waited for almost three months, finally received a very short email simply said “That’s the price we informed you”. Of course we knew the price you informed us. But we are disputing that you overcharged and we only asked refund for your overcharged portion (40%) based on your own posted price on your website. Two days later we replied to their email asking for an invoice of their pricing details. We quickly received a no-reply email from them on the same day claimed this case has been closed.

### “delayed by just under 3 hours"
Flight delayed by just under 3 hours, missed our connecting flight through to Melbourne. The customer service we received was atrocious. For example, we were offered a flight to Sydney but we would have had to make our own way to Melbourne at our cost (redeemable). We arranged overnight accommodation ourselves and have yet to be recompensed. We cannot get in touch with customer service via their online channels and emails go unanswered. Emails to their CEO and head of customer service fail to be delivered. Very poor service. We do not recommend using this airline and we will never use again.

### “planes have certainly seen their day”
Aer Lingus is one of the airlines I fly with within Europe and always to my satisfaction. Unfortunately, long-haul flight with Aer Lingus changed my view of the airline. The planes have certainly seen their day, ripped carpet, outdated, cheap looking. There was a very sad and old looking pillow on the seat, blanket had to be requested, if needed. Nothing else provided. Entertainment had very poor choices. But for anyone with a certain type of diet, you don’t always get what you requested. As a vegetarian, I had requested Vegetarian meal well in advance, received an email confirming the meal. Someone obviously didn’t do their job properly as I wasn’t served a vegetarian meal. Luckily, it was one of the options on the menu, otherwise I would’ve been left starving. Strangely, there were people in front of me who received the meal, so it was just the case of an incompetent staff member. If you have to fly with Aer Lingus while having food restrictions, bring your own food to be sure you get fed, I wouldn’t be relying on the airline. The whole experience felt amateur like. The crew didn’t seem to have much experience or customer service skills, more interested in each other’s personal lives than paying customers. I was sitting in the last row so could hear them discussing very loudly their lives and having a little party time for themselves. For such flights I would expect experienced and well-trained crew of a high standard. At the same time, behaving like little generals when talking to customers and enforcing their obnoxious rules. You are not allowed to charge your phone during take off/landing. I’d understand if that was a safety issue, but flying with other airlines, charging phones was not a problem. And they even encouraged people to feel free and charge their phones once they take to their seat. So that’s just an Aer Lingus rule, another way to bully their customers. Overall, I’m very disappointed with Aer Lingus. The flight certainly wasn’t cheap to have such a cheap experience justified. I’d understand if it was a budget airline, but paying almost €600 for a one way flight from Dublin to NYC, while getting below par service. I think Aer Lingus should concentrate on flights within Europe and leave long-haul flights to the professionals, instead of ruining their name behaving like a low-cost airline.

### "£175 for our carry on bags"
We get to the airport having checked in online and go straight to bag drop. We check out luggage in and then we see a sign that says if we don’t check our carry on luggage they will charge us 35 pound for each bit. I have never had to pay for carry on luggage under 7 kg (which is what it says the limit is). We are a group of 6. Who just paid £175 for our carry on bags! Told we can’t take the travel pram, can’t take the car seats, it just gets worse. We follow the never ending trail of hapless flyers to an abyss called gate 332-335 at Dublin airport. Only a Starbucks down there. We wait 3 hours past our departure time without any notifications. Finally the call for gate 333 comes. It says those in rows 1-10 board first, good luck with that. We were in row 1, an exit row. In Australia the seats in exit rows always have the luggage compartments cleared for those travellers use as they can’t have anything around their feet. Not this plane. Someone from halfway up the plane put their bags above us. Flight attendant didn’t give a fig. Told me to hold my coat etc etc. we arrived in Dublin. Mayhem, people jumping up, getting their bags etc. the mystery bag owner comes up and retrieves his bag. Then he pushes past everyone else to be quickly off the plane.

### "need my bag or reimbursement"
My bag disappeared into the abyss of their care, and weeks later, I’m left with nothing but their hollow promises echoing in my ears. Their customer service  call begins with empathy, sprinkled with reassuring phrases like, “We’ll escalate this immediately.” Spoiler alert: immediately is Aer Lingus code for “never.” I’ve given up hoping they’ll find my belongings — I'm now just curious if their lost luggage department is a black hole where all the unclaimed bags of the world congregate for a wild party. Aer Lingus, if you’re reading this, I don’t need another scripted apology. I need my bag or reimbursement.

### “flight was very smooth”
This was a ok flight. At the airport my bag got stuck on the baggage belt and then a worker hit it really hard but thankfully I had nothing that fragile in it. When we were boarding there was a delay because a seat was stuck reclined and they had to bring an engineer on-board. The flight was very smooth and the cabin crew were very nice although not as nice as their biggest competitor Ryanair. The landing was really good and the pilot kept giving us information about the flight.

### "Perfectly satisfactory flight"
Not Verified |  Perfectly satisfactory flight. Lounge food offerings were fairly basic, but access is given to “advantage “ passengers (premium economy?) Boarding through the North Gates is a bit messy, could the bus not go directly to the aircraft? Check in was fine and security was reasonable.

### "put us in separate rows"
I paid $150 extra to reserve two seats together for my husband and I on our return flight. Instead, Are Lingus put us in separate rows and sold our seats to other people. I was told at the gate that I had paid to reserve the opportunity to request the seats. This is the most deceptive business practice I have come across with an airline. At no point when I was picking seats and paying for them was I told that I was not guaranteed the seats. The person at the gate also told me I could just email Aer Lingus when I arrived in Boston and they would refund me the extra fees I had paid. I have emailed the company four times so far with NO response. I strongly discourage anyone from flying with this airline.

### "Horrible customer service"
Not Verified |  I called customer service on 14 Nov 2024 because I wanted to buy my daughter who is 22 months old her own seat. The website would not allow it because a child under 2 is considered a lap baby. The first customer service rep I spoke to told me to “buy a single seat for myself and then call back and customer service would add my daughter and I could pay over the phone ”. I did as instructed (but when I called back the second time a seperate customer service agent said she couldn't add my daughter to my original reservation And that I would have to buy my daughter her own separate single ticket on the website and then call back to combine the tickets . I hung up and tried to do as instructed . Only Problem is you can't buy a single ticket for anyone under the age of 18 - so I had to create a birthdate that made my daughter an adult to buy a ticket which created a whole new reservation (23X4UJ) Then I called back for a third time to combine the tickets and to fix my daughters birthdate. This customer service agent said that it was impossible to combine the tickets and that she couldn't fix the age and it would have to be done at the airport at check-in. I asked if she could just cancel both tickets and then I could repurchase correctly. She said no because my tickets werent refundable and I could apply for a voucher. Even though I just brought both tickets under the advice of two customer agents and simply wanted to rebook to combine the tickets so both passengers would be under one reservation - and would save me Time trying to explain to gate agents what happened. She refused And that there was nothing she could do. Horrible customer service - your reps do not know what they are doing - misinformation left And right. I wasted an hour on the phone talking to three reps who after each call made my situation worse. When the First rep should have told me to simple add a year to my daughters age And I would have been able to have both of travelers on the same ticket vice two reservations now.

### "Rather dismayed"
Rather dismayed, especially as the IFE screens showed 4 star airline. The seat was good and leg room good for an economy seat. There was a drinks service (only one). This was in a ten hour flight. I don’t drink alcohol but there is an extra fee for this. Quite a shock for a so called 4 star airline. Acceptable on the return night flight for one drink service as it night time but during the day? I asked for two mini cans of coke and kept one for the meal. The meal was inedible and the starter disgusting. This was accompanied by tea of coffee. Then that was it, just a nice mini tub of ice cream. Then crew vanished into thin air. The galley at the back was completely empty and unattended. Then just before landing a warm filled roll (cheese and tomato). I was very disappointed they could have at least done another drinks service - it made Virgin look amazing. Virgin do two bar services and are always visible in the cabin and passing through with orange of water to keep you hydrated. The service onboard should at least match that of BA, after all they are owned by the same company.

### “lovely staff on board”
Not Verified | Very pleasant flight. On time and lovely staff on board, smiling faces and welcoming. We flew into a storm in Dublin but the pilot (Ciaran/Keiran) brought the plane down beautifully with hardly bump. My only gripe is the seats are tight and hold luggage fees very dear, other than that nice flight.

### "crew were just apathetic"
Not Verified | I flew business class with Aer Lingus from IAD to LIS via DUB. On the IAD to DUB route with their A330, upon entering the plane on both ways; the pillows were dirty, used and have hair on them. I informed the FA and they just shrugged and handed me new pillows. The flight was delayed, so the FAs have plenty of time to replace the pillow but evidently, they just don't care. The lie flat seats were narrow and cramp but the worst part is the foot rest. I do not have giant feet but when you lie flat, you can barely fit your feet into the wedged shaped foot rest, which made it hard to sleep. The food and drinks were fine. We just had champagne and water. The crew were just apathetic in their attitude just like the typical economy class ones. The IFE have standard selections. I believe it have the same selections as the economy class ones.

### "Aer Lingus left my luggage"
Not Verified |  Aer Lingus left my luggage and the luggage of over 2 dozen people. They still have not bothered to return it. They simply claim it is out for delivery. This cannot be true. It is only 2 hours 10 minutes from Dublin to Galway. They could have delivered it 5 times by now. They even lied claiming it was the first item on the list, first stop that would be made.

### “seats are disgusting unfortunately”
The seats are disgusting unfortunately. I was in row 28 and my seat felt like it was about to collapse. The coffee and tea stains all over the tray table were also very visible. This is a 07:20am flight out of Dublin. It will be its first flight so clearly the plane was not cleaned over night. I moved to row 27 as it was not occupied. And all 3 of these seats were even more filthy. The tray tables all disgusting with coffee and tea stains. Clearly not cleaned or disinfected. The safety demonstration card had gum attached to it and every duty free magazine is gross. Page edges all curling up and the edges are dark from so many people touching them for months. The variety of A320 types are also disappointing. Ironically the older A320s have better seats. More leg room and adjustable headrests. The new A320/321Neos are extremely uncomfortable. No adjustable headrest and no seat recline.

### "we were denied boarding"
Not Verified |  We recently had a very frustrating experience with Aer Lingus on flight EI429 from Pisa to Dublin on 18 August 2024. Despite arriving at the gate only three minutes late, we were denied boarding, even though the plane was still on the tarmac, near us, with the stairs down and the door open. The ground staff refused to let us board without even checking with the crew, which was completely unreasonable. To make matters worse, the staff showed no willingness to assist or explain the situation. They ignored our requests for clarification, even though we later discovered that the flight left with a delay of over an hour. This made their decision even more unacceptable. We have contacted Aer Lingus multiple times via email to seek clarification and assistance, but have received no response. The lack of customer service and basic communication is shocking. Due to this situation, we had no choice but to take four different modes of transportation (taxis and trains, all at additional cost) to reach Milan, where we finally managed to depart in the late evening, having to purchase new tickets once again with Aer Lingus I strongly urge Aer Lingus to reconsider how they handle customer situations and offer timely responses. Based on this experience, I cannot recommend this airline to others.

### "Economy Flex offered lounge access"
Our second leg on this plane. The first was from Manchester to Belfast. There is no business class available for this flight but Economy Flex offered lounge access. We were allocated row 1 A&C which sounds great until you realise that the only passenger door, aside from emergency exits is at the rear of the plane. Consequently, we were almost the first onboard but the last off. Not such a big deal as the aircraft has only 72 seats. There is a trolley service on this one hour flight but we didn't bother, there seemed little point in paying for overpriced snacks and drinks. No IFE or Wi-fi on these flights. Cabin crew of two were pleasant and professional and that is about all you can say.

### "never fly with Aer Lingus again"
This airline is still living in the 20th century. Their app doesn’t display changed bookings, the app displays incorrect boarding & gate closure times, and the app doesn’t display your gate at all. That’s just the tip of the iceberg. Our first flight out of Chicago was delayed by an hour. They first said it was due to sanitizing the plane, but the pilot later admitted the aircraft had brake issues. Fine. We got to our layover late due to this (again, fine - these things happen). But there were no Aer Lingus personnel to be found anywhere near our gate that just closed to our connecting flight around 8am local time. We walked down past several gates and found an Aer Lingus gate agent that was just standing there. She asked us to wait so she could walk us to claim our baggage and take us through security again. 25 minutes passed before she called us to follow her. This was a red flag - a normal airline would have had us booked on the next flight immediately. Anyway, she walked us through some doors and asked us to wait there for her. She never came back! After 1/2 hour, we took it upon ourselves to find our luggage and go through customs to do so. Only one of our checked bags was found, and they had transferred it to our new flight that was already booked. Remember, this agent had us waiting around and walking all around the airport for no reason. We finally got on our next flight and landed in Rome another hour later than the rebooked flight was supposed to land! What a terrible experience. And not only that, but our three hour flight from Dublin to Rome didn’t even include a complimentary snack or water! Everything was at a cost. My God, What terrible service. We then spent hours at the luggage help desk and on the phone with Aer Lingus in an attempt to get our lost luggage. Their call center was clearly overseas and they were pretty useless. Luckily we had an AirTag in our luggage so we knew it made it to Rome. We sent proof of this to Aer Lingus per their request and they said they’d find it and send it to our resort. We called daily for updates, and each agent knew less than the previous. Luggage never arrived. We bought all new clothing. At the end of our trip, we asked a Rome airport agent (not Aer Lingus, just an airport agent) if we could check the lost baggage area. She let one of us in and we found it immediately. Needless to say, we’ll never fly with Aer Lingus again. Horrible, horrible airline.

### "my worst travel experience"
On August 24, 2024, my Daughter and I attempted to travel from Amsterdam to Seattle via Dublin. The flight, EI605, was scheduled to depart Amsterdam at 1:15 pm. We arrived at the Aer Lingus counter to check in at 10:30 am. There were already 25-30 people in front of us waiting in line and no gate agent insight. By 11:30 am, there were at least 200 people waiting in line to check in. When I called the Aer Lingus number for the Netherlands and asked where the gate agents were I was told, “They usually show up 45 minutes before the flight departs”. At 11:32 a single gate agent showed up and started checking people in. 20 minutes later, a British Airways gate agent who had finished checking people for a British Airways flight next to us, walked over to an empty counter and started helping. By the time a third gate agent arrived it was 45 minutes before the scheduled departure time and there were still dozens of people waiting in line. Everyone was extremely anxious at this point because there was til the airport security line to get through. We arrived at the departure gate at 1:30 pm. Once onboard someone announced that the airline had decided to delay the departure so that all passengers could make the flight. Due to the delay, we missed our connecting flight to Seattle in DUblin. We arrived at gate #418 in Dublin, a gate agent was still present. She told us since we missed the flight we would have to go back to baggage claim, pick up our bags and proceed to a ticket counter to book another flight. She neglected to tell us we had to be escorted by an Aer Lingus employee to baggage claim. After about 30 minutes of looking for some help we finally met a very helpful woman named Loraine. She was kind enough to escort us and others in the same predicament to baggage claim. After retrieving our bags we went to the Aer Lingus “Ticket Assistance” counter. There a gentleman named Sean described our travel options, booked a flight for the following day and told us Aer Lingus would pay for a night in a local hotel as well as dinner. When we arrived at the Carlton Dublin Airport hotel, the people working the front desk told us the hotel was completely booked. When I asked if there were other hotels nearby I was told, “We’re a 4 star hotel, we only deal with other 4 star hotels and they’re all booked full as well”. We caught a ride back to the airport. When we arrived back at the Ticket Assistance counter and told our friend Sean what had happened he disappeared into a back office for a few minutes. When he returned he said, “Since all of our contracted hotels are booked, your only option is to obtain your own lodging and send us the receipt for reimbursement”. I called at least a dozen local hotels without success. By this time it was 6:30 pm and our flight to Seattle was scheduled to leave in 12 hours. We decided to spend the night in the terminal. To add insult to injury, when we arrived in Seattle my Daughter’s suitcase somehow failed to make the flight. We’re still waiting for it. I have been a professional pilot since 1987. This was by far my worst commercial airline travel experience ever.

### “staff were not friendly at all”
This is honestly one of the worst airlines to fly with. The boarding took forever to start. We were flying at 17:30 and we were already late boarding. This was the same for our flight from Dublin to Toronto. The food was absolutely garbage and the staff were not friendly at all.

### "two of our bags failed to arrive"
Aer Lingus is not a 4 star airline. We chose this airline because we assumed by its rating here we would receive a good standard of service. It is important to us, as we were travelling with a physically challenged passenger. The actual onboard product was ok. They used older planes, but clean and functional. They had fairly good food and ok in-flight entertainment — would give it a better rating if the sound was improved. Their strength was their cabin crew. They were very good. Friendly & attentive. Where is all unravels for these guys, however, is their customer support & communication. Like mentioned, we traveled with a passenger that requires special assistance. I had communicated all the special needs months ahead of schedule, yet upon arrival at airport I learnt not all the information had been passed on. This is not totally abnormal unfortunately, but in this case, I couldn’t even call regarding the matter. I was reliant on an extremely slow & disorganised email service. In fact, we have already returned from our 3 week trip and some of the emails still haven’t been answered! Thankfully the cabin crew were able to help us when onboard, yet even they were frustrated with the lack of communication. On this trip two of our bags failed to arrive in Toronto and a bag was missing on return. It took 7 days to be reunited with one of our bags in Toronto, and when we got it, it was wet inside. In that process, the airline blamed Canadian customs. Canadian customs explained it was a typical ruse for an airline to blame them when they made a mistake. On this return leg, we have been waiting 4 days. There no real way to contact them to find out what the updates are. All we know is that it was loaded into a container in Dublin. As there are at least 2 Aer Lingus flights to Amsterdam per day, I can’t imagine what they are not doing. Possibly waiting for it to get totally soaked again?

### "six days getting reunited with our luggage"
Day 1 - 10 AM : upon landing in Lyon (France) after flying from Toronto (Canada) through Dublin (Ireland), we find out our checked luggage are missing. Report and destination address submitted immediately through the kiosk, and confirmed with relevant luggage agent onsite. Are assured our luggage would get sent directly to airport closest to our destination (Turin, Italy) and delivered to our door, with a likely turnaround of 24 to 48 hours. Day 3 - 6 PM : our luggage lands in Turin (Italy), after flying through Lyon (France) and Frankfurt (Germany). That route contradicts what the onsite luggage agent had told us and added one extra unnecessary day to the initial delay. Day 5 - 5 PM : Turin Airport Lost and Found office advises our luggage is now in their possession (at this stage, it had already been in Turin Airport for nearly 48 hours), and notifies that we would have to fill in a customs form to allow them to proceed with our luggage shipping to our final destination, with an estimated delivery time of an additional 24 to 48 hours. At this stage, it could mean a full week for Aer Lingus to gets us reunited us with our luggage after they have located them (in Dublin airport) and were provided with our destination address. What took them an additional two days, adding to the previous unnecessary delay. Day 6 - 2 PM : we retrieved our luggage from Turin Airport Lost and Found office, despite the 3.5 hour drive involved. When asked how long they have been in Turin Airport, Sagat Handling claim “they don’t know, and are too busy to find out”. To summarise, my partner and I waited six days before getting reunited with our luggage, while anyone could fly from Dublin to Turin and back in a single day. After the sequence of mishaps and miscommunications that led to this outcome, you would expect some acknowledgement from the airline. I unfortunately had further opportunities to test Aer Lingus poor customer service tools and processes (offering no visibility on case history, status and next steps) and interest (simply receiving standard replies and templates - not addressing our case specifics), and escalated the saga to the highest executive level at Aer Lingus. Despite multiple attempts, none of them showed more professionalism or interest in customer experience satisfaction. How does that align with your mission statement (“Our mission is to make every journey count. We do this with care and consideration for people and planet”),

### "Seats are comfortable"
Not Verified |   Aer Lingus is the airline I have flown on the most in my life and the majority of my flights have been top notch. Seats are comfortable, aircraft are clean, food is good, flights have been on time and staff have been friendly. I was flying from Faro to Dublin on an A330-202 on the 10th July 2024. The aircraft is 22 years old so I knew the cabin was going to be a bit aged. However the IFE was quite outdated and my seat felt thin. The IFE had no modern headphone jack, still had physical buttons on it and used the old Aer Lingus shamrock on the screen. One re-occurring issue I have with Aer Lingus is with the IFE system's map. It is primitive and is completely un-interactive. Apart from this the IFE is great. It is fast and has a good choice of movies, TV shows, audio, info and games.

### "being difficult about reimbursement"
We flew from Cleveland, OH to Chicago, IL then Chicago to Dublin and finally to Glasgow. We had the most amazing flight attendant on our way from Chicago to Dublin (Casey-Jade)! When we got to Dublin we found out our flight to Glasgow was delayed twice for 3+ hours. We had issues at the airport from Aer Lingus on what gate to be at, making us go back and further from two gates that were rather far apart. When we were boarding the plane on the tarmac I saw our luggage out on the tarmac to be loaded onto the plane. After boarding the flight, my mom could see from her window that our luggage wasn’t being loaded onto the plane and then the baggage carrier loaded our bags back onto his car to drive away. My mom brought this to the flight attendants attention. Others on the plane then notices the same thing happening to their bags. We asked the flight attendant to do something about this but neither did and the male flight attendant was rude when speaking to us. After continued questioning, the male flight attendant did open the door and asked the man on the ground if all bags for were loaded on the plane, he said yes. Obviously, the baggage carrier on the ground wouldn’t think he missed bags to load. This was all either flight attendant did to help prevent our bags from not making it to our final destination. While the male flight attendant was visibly mad and spoke to us in a very aggressive manner the whole time. We then arrived in Glasgow, without our luggage. We were 2 of 8 passengers who’s luggage weren't loaded onto that flight. We filed the claim at the desk. I explained to the representation that my mom and I were on a guided tour trip and we would be moving from one hotel to the next each day – we would not be at the same hotel for the first 3 or 4 days of our trip. I called to speak to a representative later that day to see if our bags made it on one of the multiple other flights out of Dublin to Glasgow that day. The person I spoke with could not answer this. I asked for a supervisor and was told they needed to call me back. Conversations like this went over for an additional 2 days. I had explained to every single person I spoke with the severity of our situation and urgency in which we needed to get our luggage. I got the run around from every customer service representative and supervisor from the lost baggage team. I could never get a clear answer on what was happening, where my bags were or when they would arrive. No one seemed to care, at all. It was an awful experience and feeling. I finally saw by checking the online form that our bags were picked up. They were picked up by Aviation Operations. They weren't delivered that day. I called Aer Lingus’s customer service again and couldn't get an answer as to why they were not delivered or when they would be. So I reached out to Aviation Operations myself. They initially informed me that they would be delivered the next day which would then put us at a different location, again. After more communication, they told me that having my request upgraded to ‘express’ could get them there the same day. I was appalled to hear that after everything I had communicated to the customer service front line and supervisors that NO ONE had marked this as express already. We did finally get our bags due to my persistent effort but now Aer Lingus is being difficult about reimbursement for all of these issues.

### "passport was about to expire in October"
Not Verified |   Very disappointed with Aer Lingus. My flight was on the 22nd June to Turkey. Supposed to be flying with my partner and 4 kids but unfortunately myself and 3 kids had to stay behind and only 2 people make the trip. I have made a check in over 2 weeks ago and there was no problem whatsoever with the passports I have made the check in both ways for all the group. We were at the airport and we done everything as we  supposed to do. Went through all the gates and security's till we got to the final check right before thy were letting people on the plain. My sons passport was about to expire in October so he wasn't allowed to go and so myself and all 3 kids had to stay behind. That was nightmare. Trying to explain little children that holiday is now not happening. We had to get back to the airport and collect our suitcase. Which wasn't easy either as you can imagine.

### “quite rude and unhelpful”
Not Verified | I recently flew from Malaga to Dublin with  Aer Lingus on May 16th. Unfortunately after landing I discovered my suitcase had been badly damaged. There were pieces broken off it and scratches all over it. I tried to search the website to see how to lodge a baggage complaint but it’s very difficult to find what to do. So I tried to contact their customer service on May 18th but I could only get a chat bot. I explained everything and this chat bot said someone would contact me as soon as possible. I waited for a phone call or email but nothing came. So on May 27th I called the customer service team and got speaking to a man who told me you have to search for after flight services and then he told me what to do to lodge a baggage complaint. So I did this and I received back a reply stating that I didn’t lodge the complaint in the correct manner within seven days so my claim was void. I explained how I was waiting as I was told someone would contact me however this fell on deaf ears. On May 31st I called customer service again as nobody was replying in my claim. They were quite rude and unhelpful so I asked for a supervisor to contact me which I was told would happen in a few days. I called back on June 5th as nobody rang me. I was told a supervisor would contact me within 24-48 hours. I again called back today (June 10th) as nobody called me. The guy I spoke with today told me the other agents forgot to put a request in for a supervisor to call me but he has done now and one will call me within 24 hours. I feel like this is awful customer service and that Aer Lingus policy seems to be to ignore the customer who has a complaint and hopefully they will just stop calling. The worst service I have ever received.

### "broke the wheels off our luggage"
Not Verified |   My wife and i flew Aer Lingus on the 12 of May 2024 out of Seattle to Dublin. Worst flight we have ever had. Flight crews were verging on being down right rude and acted like they didn't even want to be there. Not a smile or happy employee on the entire plane. Couldn't understand any announcements from the flight deck the speaker system was so bad. The food was just barely edible and breakfast was just awful. Cold sandwich of some kind. I asked for some extra sugar for coffee and you would have thought it was asking for gold. I hoped the return flight would be better. It was not. We received the same treatment on our return flight on the 24th May out of Dublin to San Francisco. We also booked a flight through Aer Lingus to Scotland from Dublin and back to Dublin one week later, on their connector airline called Emerald Air. On the return to Dublin emerald air broke the wheels off our luggage and split the cases beyond repair, not just one but 2 of them. Filed a claim with Aer Lingus and still have heard nothing from them about the damage. Never fly with Aer Lingus or their partner Emerald air, Its just not worth the money at any price.

### "not part of any alliances"
Comment on Lounges is based on one lounge in Dublin airport and even that when compared to one world or Star alliance lounges offers the very minimal in refreshment. Call centre for any support is based in Bulgaria and they offer no support just refer to web forms which are ignored. Aer Lingus is not part of any alliances such as one world or star alliance so offer none of the benefits of other airlines owned by IAG, it's a simple point to point airline. Their loyalty club Aer Club offers no benefits such a express security lanes etc when in other non Dublin airports or across Europe and only budget lounge access. Water is not free on flights, Wifi is capped and only available on transatlantic flights.

### "10 kg of luggage can be checked in"
Aer Lingus is probably not a low cost airline, but that is probably the case when it comes to on-board service. Check-in was quick and easy. The flight was on time and the luggage was delivered very quickly. What's good is that 10 kg of luggage can be checked in with no extra charge.

### "my flight is cancelled"
Not Verified |   I booked the ticket 10 days ago I called the airline yesterday as i was unable to do the check in online. They said i can do it online I came to airport 3 hours before my flight and i was surprised by the fact that my flight is cancelled by the storm. They didn't bother to send email tell us that. It was a bad experience for me and my kids. I came with uber and i spend 80pound going and coming back to and from airport. No costumer service to help and guide in the airport. .

### "way back from Rome was awful"
Not Verified |  My way back from Rome was awful. I filed a complaint and called. I heard nothing. When leaving Rome 3.27.24 they held up the flight calling people to the front to "see our passports one more time". Then we got on a bus that took 45 minutes. Very hot crowded bus. We get to the plane and are left on the tarmac - flight attendant said the engine was "broken" and we need to wait. No explanation. No air and then he wouldn't let anyone use the bathroom because we might take off. Then I asked female flight attendant if we could get off early because we might miss our connector. She said your sitting close enough someone will be there to help when we get off the flight. No one was there. The people of the desk were so mean. First they said we missed it then I said we still have 35 minutes and she said well customs closed it I was wrong. Then said we cant get back until the next day go see hotel desk. No one helped us we finally found someone and desk wasn't even marked. Never did we get an apology or any offer for financial reimbursement.

### "Worst customer service"
Emailed schedule change but no details. Waited 3 days - nothing. Phoned CS - no idea what was about - will let us know promptly (within a week?). Anxiety sky high. No communication. Phoned again - cheerfully told they had cancelled our inbound flight but that we could get a refund - but only for that flight as outbound still flying!? Just unbelievable. Of course we had accommodation car hire etc booked. Asked re alternatives. Not to worry was told Aer Lingus will ensure we can get an equivalent flight - no problem. Only there was as no flight possible on that date. Was offered similar on next day. Told that Aer Lingus would reimburse us for any additional costs. Said would phone back next day to give time to discuss. Didn’t. I phoned them again. Was told by different person would be reimbursed for costs. No alternative but to book. Asked for confirmation that they would pay additional costs - claimed they were unable to do so as no outgoing mail allowed. Had to redo accommodation (move for one night ): car hire: insurance etc. A lot of hassle. Return a nightmare. Given wrong seats at Check in Orlando. Had to change at gate - tried to give us economy seats instead of Business then did issue Business but not in our names! Had to go back to sort out! No priority for embarking - had to complain -twice - before they would let us on. Shambles. On return submitted extremely modest claim - even ate in the Hotel buffet where they give 25% discount for seniors - which was immediately rejected. They say they have no obligation towards us as they gave us sufficient notification of cancellation. I have been fighting this since but am getting nowhere. They are not affiliated to any ADR so you are basically on your own. Worst customer service - absolute misnomer - ever. They lie and deny. If you have another option take it. I have had to give an overall rating of 1 but it would be minus for all the anxiety and upset they have caused

### “Incredibly poor customer service”
Not Verified |  Customer service? They don't know the meaning of customer service. Literally pulling my hair out trying to even talk to them. They’re a shambles, don't have a clue what there doing and don't care for their customers at all. Cancelled our flight (which was pre booked 9 months in advance) they cancelled it with less than 12 hours notice and this flight was very important to us as we had paid for a very expensive 60th birthday party for my mother which cost over £3000. Hence why the flights were booked 9 months in advance. However Aer Lingus cancelled them not even 12 hours before we were due to fly. They refused a refund at first. Refused to compensate anything at all. Told me they couldn't pay for any hotel expenses etc (when they can as they refunded a friend of mine for her hotel) so shows they don't stick to the rules and discrimination comes to mind as they pick and choose who they want to refund. In the end after more than a month later and endless amounts of emails and I even wrote to them in person and paid £10 to send everything by air mail from England to Dublin. They still haven't provided the refund apart from £26 for extra baggage we paid for. Said the other £216 is on its way, still not received more than a month and still arguing with them over it. We had to pay an extra £700 for alternative flights due to Aer Lingus behaviour. We didn't get an apology or refund or nothing back. They cost us a lot of money. I would not recommend them to anyone and I will never ever use Aer Lingus to fly again. And we are regular travellers who fly every couple of months and always at least 4 of us. Sometimes groups of 10 of us. So they have lost a lot of loyal and genuine customers being my whole family just because they could not acknowledge what they did wrong or even provide a refund for our cancelled flight. Incredibly poor customer service. Also a complete lack of empathy from their staff as to my situation, it clearly just shows the contempt that Aer Lingus have for their customers. Stay well away.

### “they do not value their customers”
In September 2023, I faced a situation with Aer Lingus that I feel compelled to share, as a stark warning to others considering this airline for their travels. After circumstances beyond my control forced me to cancel a flight I had booked, which cost me over 700 Euro, I was plunged into a customer service nightmare that left me feeling cheated and disrespected. Upon contacting Aer Lingus to discuss my options, I was informed that I would only be eligible for a refund of the taxes, amounting to a paltry 50 Euro. This was a shock to me, given the significant amount I had paid. Seeking a more reasonable solution, I requested a voucher for the full value of the ticket, hoping for some flexibility given the unforeseen nature of my cancellation. However, this request was met with an unwavering refusal, accompanied by a cold explanation that it was “too late” for such considerations. The interaction with Aer Lingus’ customer service was not only unhelpful but also distinctly unkind. At no point did I feel heard or understood; instead, I was left feeling like a mere statistic in their booking system, devoid of any human empathy or understanding. The rigidity and lack of accommodation displayed by Aer Lingus have convinced me that they do not value their customers or consider the complexities of real-life situations that may affect one’s travel plans. This experience has been deeply upsetting, not just because of the financial loss, which is significant, but also because of the realization that Aer Lingus is not an airline you can trust to treat you with fairness or compassion. Their unwillingness to provide reasonable solutions or exhibit a basic level of customer service decency is alarming. I urge anyone considering flying with Aer Lingus to think twice. There are numerous airlines out there that value their customers and understand the importance of flexible policies and compassionate service. Unfortunately, based on my experience, Aer Lingus is not among them. This is not just about the money lost but about the principle of treating customers with respect and understanding, qualities Aer Lingus has demonstrated they sorely lack.

### “provides a low-cost experience”
Not only specific to my most recent flight but the general experience, and degradation thereof, of Aer Lingus. An airline that charges premium / luxury fare but then provides a low-cost experience, sometimes even worse. From the "lounges" on offer at their various locations and lacking in options, to the lack of any type of useful customers support over the phone and online. This is an airline that doesn't know whether its coming or going. The one saving grace I would say is staff on location are by and large very helpful and supportive.

### "Totally unexceptional experience"
Not Verified |  Totally unexceptional experience on our return journeys. On time flights, slow check-in especially in Geneva. Boarding was fairly slow. Seating was satisfactory. Flight attendants & trolley service were fine. Baggage delivery was punctual & all arrived safely

### "lost a long time customer today"
Disgusting service from start to finish, treated like an a piece of garbage at the gate for their mistake of not printing priority boarding on my boarding pass. And then told it was not their fault. Well, then whose is it? Also purchased Heathrow Express tickets through them and never received them, they blamed it on Heathrow Express and I was told to ring them. I will never fly this airline again, complete buffoonery and third rate service since pandemic. You lost a long time customer today.

### "Cabin crew were very friendly"
Disgraceful experience in Munich. Only one person at the desk and there was a huge line people waiting to check in bags. And at the last half and hour another person came and we went to her and done everything but there were queues at security and if that wasn’t enough the boarding pass didn’t scan at security so I had to wait to get my boarding pass back. But onboard it was a great experience. Cabin crew were very friendly. And even during turbulence the pilot was talking on the intercom to say it’s fine. And on Lufthansa that I just flew water was free on Lufthansa but on Aer Lingus you had to pay three euro and they are not supposed to be a budget airline but one thing that was great at the airport was that they waited for everyone.

### "aircraft that is in horrific condition"
Flew on EI-EIL, an old aircraft that is in horrific condition. Seats broken, inflight entertainment broken, no Wi-Fi, no charging facilities. Aircraft shouldn’t be in operation.

### "doesn't care about clients"
My girlfriend and I had a 9 hours flight without TV and WiFi. The food on board was ok with the meal they served but after the meal you can order only crisps, for 9 hours. Insane that they pretend you should have only a meal and crisps, if you want a sandwich you can get after 6 hours. The cabin crew was ok, on board nothing works. Looks like Aer Lingus doesn't care about clients.

### “cabin crew exceeded all expectations”
Not Verified | The check-in staff at Manchester gave me incorrect information regarding my baggage. I was told it had been checked-in to Phoenix but that it was necessary for me to retrieve it in Chicago and place it on another conveyor belt. This was NOT true. My baggage went directly to Phoenix, but it caused me a lot of unnecessary anxiety. Having said that, the cabin crew exceeded all expectations. They were the friendliest, kindest and most helpful cabin crew I have ever flown with. This makes a huge difference. Thank you Aer Lingus.

### "worst airline I have flown on"
Aer Lingus is the worst airline I have flown on. They cancelled a flight to Manchester at midnight and abandoned more than 140 passengers at Barbados airport with no help to find transport or hotel rooms. There were no Aer Lingus staff on the ground and the flight crew and Captain vanished and went to a nearby hotel. The same thing happened the following night when the second flight was cancelled at 10pm. The passengers were treated with contempt. Since then it has been impossible to get any help. The overseas Contact Centre is diabolical. They say they are unable to handle complaints and can't contact anyone senior at Aer Lingus or even the Customer Relations team because they "have no phone numbers for them," This airline gives a bad name to the whole industry and is a disgrace to Ireland as a country.

### "To say it was rude was an understatement"
BHX-BHD-BHX (7 Oct - 9 Oct) Check-in counter at Birmingham Airport was quite friendly and jolly and appeared happy to speak to customers. My luggage including my friend’s were lumped into one since I had a 23kg baggage allowance. Flying back from Belfast to Birmingham on EI3646 on the 9th of October, however was the complete opposite. This review is not entirely about the baggage but the appalling attitude of the woman behind the check-in desk. I have now flown over 59 airlines in total from 5 star airlines to 2 stars and over a hundred airports around the world from a small airport in Dunedin in New Zealand to the likes of Heathrow and Changi in Singapore, but the attitude of the check-in agent for Aer Lingus at BHD is something that I haven’t encountered anywhere. I’m also a BA Silver Executive Club member (nearly gold now). To say it was rude was an understatement. She treated us like we haven’t flown before. My mate and I were trying to explain that at BHX, they’d let us combine our check-in baggage, but this woman won’t let us and she was argumentative. It looked like her other colleague felt embarrassed in her behalf. She was not a good representative of the airline. It added to our frustration that the flights were delayed out of Belfast. I was lucky that I have got a Dragon Pass Premier and able to use the lounge.

### “The airline is absolutely terrible”
The airline is absolutely terrible. Our flight was canceled because the engine was broken and we were given no other option than to fly into a different city and take busses. Everyone was rude and we were treated very poorly. The planes were disgusting, the food wasn't edible, the seats were tiny, the planes are clearly not well maintained and everything was broken. I know the flights are cheap, but you may be taking a bus and traveling overnight unexpectedly. I suggest paying a little more to not have to be treated like a ticket instead of a person.

### "Excellent service from the cabin crew"
Not Verified |  Flew Manchester/Belfast/Manchester. Both flights were on time and indeed early. Excellent service from the cabin crew for such a short flight. Drinks available both ways. Smooth disembarkation.

### "don't check any bags"
The service onboard and the flights themselves were ok, but the circus before and after were criminal. Returning from Manchester started with confusion and delay. Granted, some of it could be attributed to the airport but the delay and luggage problems were all Aer Lingus. Dublin was another big delay which was good otherwise we would have missed our flight. Arriving in Chicago we waited for our luggage only to find that 4 pieces had not arrived. There was no one to there to talk to and just a sign with a website for instructions. The next 10 days and hours and hours on the phone were excruciating as our next assignment was fast approaching. We had to replace many of the tools of our trade. Then when we sought refunds for the things we needed replaced and had no assurance of ever seeing before we left. Their system was so broken down that even though I sent all the needed documentation, they refunded only a portion of what they premised. If you are going to fly Aer Lingus, don't check any bags.

### "Such a lovely cabin crew"
Not Verified |  I would just like to say the landing both going to and coming from Dubrovnik 18th - 25th September was excellent. Such a lovely cabin crew especially Daniel & Rebecca they were exceptional. Both a credit to your airline.

### "Should have flown Ryanair"
Not Verified |  Should have flown Ryanair. Female agent at check-in was rude and sarcastic. Booked 2 seats up front only to find our loading in pouring rain from rear of plane- too cheap to pay for a sky walkway onto plane. Seats uncomfortable as heck and service bad. At Dublin unloaded again in rain 15 minutes from Terminal - too cheap to unload on a sky walkway. Paid for an Airport Lounge pass in Glasgow but guess what - no lounge! For the price about 100 pounds more per ticket than Ryanair. Yet even less value than Ryanair which is hard to imagine.

### "the crew were good fun"
Any airline at 50% occupancy is going to be a bonus and this is especially true out of season on the holiday route from Manchester to Orlando. We had room to spread out, the crew were good fun and the food wasn’t bad. Alcohol is paid for, which is very anti-Irish but the entertainment selection was decent too. Not sure I’d like a full flight full of screaming kids but this was a good one.

### "we will definitely fly you again"
Not Verified |  This was a short flight, but a very meaningful one because we were leaving relatives in Dublin and going to meet relatives for the first time in Frankfurt after searching for over 54 years. I was a nervous wreck because I hate flying. It scares me to death yet I keep doing it. This flight was pleasant upon boarding so we were off to a good start. I had my usual, initial fear on takeoff, but the flight attendants were absolutely amazing throughout the flight from beginning to end. The seats were full and comfortable with a rounded headrest that was amazingly soft. The cost was great (points) the flight attendants were superb, and there was legroom and comfortable seating. What more could you ask for? Thank you Aer Lingus, we will definitely fly you again. Madeleine and Hunter from Maryland in the United States.

### "3rd tier airline that continues to disappoint"
Not Verified |  Unbelievable service, they lost one of our bags. Cannot get any help from online service or staff at airport. We arrived on the 17th and have finally heard that our bag was now at the Cleveland airport since Monday. Cannot get anyone on the line to get a delivery. This was good news to get Aer Lingus to Cleveland with direct service to Dublin. Unfortunately, we now know that they are a 3rd tier airline that continues to disappoint.

### “They’ve lost 17 customers”
Aer Lingus lost the baggage for an entire tour group! And they have done absolutely nothing to help facilitate finding the luggage and getting it to us. My bag has a locator tag in it. I’ve told them where it is. They still can’t find it! They have managed to ruin a vacation for 17 people. Bags have been missing for 3 days! Customer service is rude and keeps passing us off from one person to the next. I’ve been traveling for quite a few years, and never have I experienced such horrible airline service. They’ve lost 17 customers and they clearly do not care!

### "Absolutely dreadful!"
Absolutely dreadful! I made the mistake of saying I was too hot, the plane was very very hot, was given some water and the air hostess then said she wanted me to see a medic, pilot came to see me and said he was happy to fly me home but air hostess decided she wasn’t happy. I was asked to go to the back of the plane to get some fresh air and see a medic, no medic boarded the plane and whilst I’m sitting there quietly the air hostess appeared with my bags and took them off the plane, I was then told to leave the plane and someone from Aer Lingus would meet me. I was dumped at a doorway and told to find my way to arrivals! Lucky for me a member of Dublin Airport staff took pity on me and assisted. I then discovered that the air hostess had not actually put my kindle paper white back in my bag and even though there was no passenger in the seat next to me, my kindle was never found. Medics were I later found out told to stand down as were no longer needed (so much for passenger care) and the desk when I finally got there was closed. A lovely man called Paul did his best to help me but ultimately I had to find somewhere to spend the night and then had to book a flight with Ryanair the following morning to get home as I should have been at work and could not get home with Aer Lingus. As none of this was my fault I asked for my money back as not only had I paid for a flight that I was not given I’d even paid to upgrade my seat that I wasn’t allowed to use. I have been told I’m not entitled to a refund even though Aer Lingus have taken money for a service they have failed to provide.

### "Mediocre experience"
Not Verified |  Mediocre experience. First the good: the plane left and arrived on time and they did not loose my luggage. Now the bad: the temperature was frosty, at least in my section of the plane, which was the very first row of economy, so much that I was freezing with 2 blankets on me, and it was the same for the person next to me. The seats are narrow and very hard. There was no entertainment, no screens and no movies, zilch. In theory, you could use their WIFI to watch something on your laptop, but the WIFI did not work. Most transatlantic flights offer free wine but not this one. An annoying detail: the attendant insist you keep your window cover closed, even if there is light out, this was around 6 pm, yet the neon lights are on all the time in the attendant's station. The meals are very small portions. The attendants seemed distracted, I had to ask 3 different people for a morning beverage and wait 20 minutes before getting it. All in all, I would not advise to fly with them.

### "the experience was disheartening"
I booked a ticket with Aer Lingus for my first trip from Athens to Boston via Dublin with a layover. The cost was $800. On Flight EI 441 from Athens to Dublin, with a 12:55 Greek time departure, we experienced a one-hour delay and departed around 14:00 Greek time. After about 4 hours of flight, we reached Dublin airport. Despite assurances from the flight crew, we were informed that we missed the Boston flight. The staff's behavior was rude, and they provided false information. They booked me for a flight the next day from Shannon, not Dublin, with a layover in New York. Other passengers faced similar issues. After hours of lies, a staff came to our aid and admitted there were no rooms reserved for us near Shannon. Eventually, rooms were found, but the experience was disheartening. The following day, my Shannon to JFK flight went well, but the JFK to Boston flight with DELTA was delayed by an hour. I arrived in Boston on August 25th at 20:15, missing my original arrival time of August 24th at 18:50. To add to the trouble, Aer Lingus lost my suitcase.

### “isn’t much better than Ryanair”
It isn’t much better than Ryanair. My tray table was dirty but my tray table on Ryanair was clean. And I prefer Ryanair cabin crew as they were really nice. But on Aer Lingus they weren’t that nice. The only reason we fly with them is because Ryanair messed up our booking (I wrote a review on that) and that they don’t operate that route.

### "for compensation they denied everything"
Aer Lingus was almost 2 hours late into Heathrow which caused all 5 of my family members to miss our United Airlines connecting flight home. Our flight was 100 feet off the ground from landing at Heathrow and then suddenly took off and we circled for over an hour. We were already 30 minutes late taking off. The crew did nothing to help those with connecting flights get off the plane first. Aer Lingus customer service at the airport was going to rebook us and pay for the new flights but couldn't find any flights for 2 days. The service rep at the airport recommended we book our own flights if we could find any and send in for compensation so that's what we did. She implied we should get some kind of compensation for the flight, hotels and other expenses. We had to stay the night in Heathrow and booked our own flights out the next day. When we submitted everything for compensation they denied everything. I tried 3 times to get them to cover at least a portion of our expenses but they did nothing. also, you cannot talk to customer service, everything is thru email. I have had several flight disruptions over the years and have never had an airline not compensate us for something. This was the worse flight disruption I've ever experienced and cost us over $10,000 to get back home. Aer Lingus kept throwing some flight regulations at us on why they don't have to

### "good representatives of their airline"
On 20th August 2023, I flew with Aer Lingus from Cork to London Heathrow on a very busy Sunday evening. The check-in agent was very helpful and friendly! My bag had suffered damage at Heathrow a few day earlier and the agent at Cork Airport was very informative and supportive and told me how to make a complaint. Boarding was orderly and efficient and the cabin crew on this short flight of just under one hour were not only professional but very good representatives of their airline and indeed country. I saw several people with children and an elderly gentleman being assisted unprompted by the cabin crew. Disembarkation was quick and the luggage arrived promptly too. My only gripe is the high cost of this flight in relation to the distance flown. The A320 is perfect for this short route, it was clean and in good order.

### "have some training in how to speak to customers"
On the morning of 18th August 2023, I flew with Aer Lingus from Heathrow terminal two to Dublin. I had to leave home very early for the check-in as this flight departed at 640am. The queue for check-in and bag drop off was very poorly managed from a range of perspectives and created a very poor first impression of the airline. Firstly, there was a visible disagreement between 2 uniformed staff members. A member of staff was unable to use a computer and had to call one of her colleagues for help. This employee was not only unable to use the computer but was unnecessarily abrupt with customers and contradicted herself in the instructions she barked out. She could see one of the bag-drop machines was broken and sent 2 young people and an elderly couple to the machine in question and then ignorantly shouted at the elderly couple when they told her for the second time that the machine was broken. When I used a self-drop off machine, I was rudely spoken to by a man. Passengers ended up helping each other as the staff were of no help. Boarding was functional but not well organised. On this busy flight the staff were almost invisible. When the aircraft arrived into Dublin there was a delay as another aircraft was at the gate. The positive side is that the flight was punctual. Aer Lingus need to make sure that their Heathrow staff have some training in how to speak to customers in a civil manner.

### "Cannot praise them enough"
Out of all the overseas carriers, we were able to snag 4 tickets for $3800, baggage and seat selection included on both legs, in the summer. Check in online and dropping off baggage was a breeze. Plane was older but relatively clean with seat back entertainment working as it should and tasty meals. Smiling, courteous, professional flight attendants on all flights we took. From Toronto to Heathrow via Dublin and back, flights on time, but I booked properly and allowed up to 3 hrs of layover when needed. If it wasn't for Aer Lingus we would not have had a memorable once in a lifetime family trip. There are always issues it seems nowadays, but we experienced none traveling through this busy season. Cannot praise them enough.

### "Completely disgusting and disrespectful"
Not Verified |  I canceled my flight due to my mom's funeral. On the website they write that is very simple, fill the form with a proof of death and that is it. In reality is it completely different, they used to ignore my emails, and change the conditions to make everything possible to not proceed with a refund. The top was, that I have to send a copy of the death certificate through the post, signed and sealed. Completely disgusting and disrespectful towards someone’s grief. I had in the same period a flight with easyJet, they refunded the money with this reason within a day. Will never buy again a ticket with them, and highly recommended to everyone to not choose a company that has this attitude.

### "Delay after delay after delay"
Delay after delay after delay, I begged the agent to rebook us at Heathrow airport or on the later flight from Dublin. Based on math, 7 minutes didn’t seem like enough to make the connection. The flight attendant assured us no we’d be fine, and said she would make it. Incorrect. We did not make it. Now we had to go through customs. We waited for (I’m yelling in this part) ONE HOUR AND FORTY FIVE MINUTES for our luggage. We couldn’t rebook until after we retrieved our luggage. I could have dragged it from London faster. They told us to wait until 3pm (2 hours) to find out if we’d get on stand by to Chicago. We didn’t get on standby. The only option was New York the same day or Chicago the next afternoon. We do not live in New York. We can get you to New York but you’re on your own from there”. WHAT? So my option is to spend money on a hotel and Ubers in Dublin while extending my childcare another 36 hours or spend $842 getting myself home from JFK airport. I reluctantly chose the latter, because I would’ve done a lot worse to get there. I feel disgusted. I am now so late to get home to my 1.5 year old who is eagerly waiting for me. I now will arrive home 10 hours later than planned with $842 less. Thanks Aer Lingus. Never again.

### "Worst lack of care"
Not Verified |  We flew Aer Lingus last summer Seattle to Dublin to Edinburgh and then back Edinburg to Dublin to Seattle. Our plane left quite late from Seattle with no explanation and we ended up getting into Dublin several hours late missing our connecting flight. No one there to help, an hour bouncing around to different Aer Lingus staff in the arrival terminal w/o one person helping us. We finally ended up outside back at check-in in a long line of rebooking passengers who were told we wouldn’t make the next Edinburgh flight as it was booked, last one out that day. The staff were unwilling to book us on Ryan Air which EU regulations say should happen as they had plenty of seats. A supervisor took pity on me and somehow got me on the last flight but we arrived in Edinburgh 5 hours or more late outside of the EU regulations with no food or drink offered or available. Aer Lingus has denied the EU regulation payment saying it’s not covered since  unforeseen circumstances on first rejection and then it was a us domestic originated flight so it isn’t covered (not true since it started in Dublin and arrived late into the States). On flight to Dublin they lost my wife’s suitcase and it didn’t get to us until the 2nd to last day in Ireland, over 72 hours when it’s considered a lost bag, we filed a claim, and not once has anyone acknowledged this reimbursement owed for the modest clothing she had to buy. I’ve been on hold with their customer service for hours, sent many inquiries, and tried to escalate this but no there cares about us. Worst lack of care for us we’ve seen from an airline.

### "its service with a shrug"
Please beware that the entertainment system on the St MacDara aircraft Dublin to Orlando is not operational. What that means is that most of the seat screens are not working so even though you have paid a lot of money for your seat you had better have downloaded your own movies/music and games on your own equipment prior to the flight. Also the WIFI is not working. Aer Lingus state that it is a 'compatibility issue' but its actually that the plane is old and most of the equipment such as the controllers for the screens have been broken and not repaired. They are also serving freshly brewed iced coffee just before you land, even if you want hot coffee. All in all its service with a shrug.

### "Very efficient, pleasant staff"
Just flown Alicante to Dublin. Very efficient, pleasant staff at check in and on board the aircraft. Even had a yarn with the pilot who did a super soft landing. Highly recommended.

### "delayed by more than an hour"
Not Verified | Depart: delayed by more than an hour, no explanation. In flight: 90 minute flight, paid for extra leg room, not worth it, last off the plane. Shuttle from end of airport to terminal to get bags. Deplaning: They neglected to inform any of us (who waited for an hour) that they had to leave 40+ bags in Southampton, due to overweight on the plane. I was the first bag to be checked in at Southampton and have not yet received my luggage! It's been 3 days, and all I get on the tracer app is, still looking.

### "inefficient with their check in"
Not Verified |  They're so inefficient with their check in even airport security and marshalls were joking about it. The queue to get checked in was so long as the staff never pitched. The long queue disrupted other airlines from checking their customers through. I will avoid this airline. I booked British Airways, but they seem to codeshare with  Aer Lingus.

### "will never fly with them again"
Not Verified |  Delays leaving Dublin caused us to miss our connection and they did nothing to help book our hotel room in Heathrow for the night. They dodged paying compensation and made it as difficult as possible to file for a reimbursement of out of pocket expenses. Eventually claimed they sent us a check but months on, no check and they refuse to respond to our case claim anymore. Their “refund” call center doesn’t actually exist so they can simply ignore your online claims. I suspect we will be left footing the bill at this stage. Feel helpless, Mad as hell and will never fly with them again.

### "they tell us flight closed"
Not Verified |  We arrived over 2 hours before our flight was to depart from Dublin to Philadelphia and checked with ticket assistance when we saw a line in ticketing that was very long. The ticketing assistant told us to get in line. No mention of 75 minute flight closing time or that we should go to a "special flight closing counter" if the 75 minutes was close to expiring before we got to ticketing counter. We get to ticketing counter and they tell us flight closed, too late. Then when we go back to ticketing assistance counter, they blame us for "not listening to the announcement" that the Philadelphia flight was closing. We never heard such and announcement and asked the ticketing assistant why they did not tell us about all of this when we initially approached them and questioned them. They continued to blame us. Very poorly managed airline based on my experience, and the attitude of the employees who dealt with us was not a reflection of poor management.

### "staff are very rude and unprofessional"
Not Verified |  The staff at Dublin airport are very rude and unprofessional. I was 3 hours early for my flight from Dublin to New York. I needed help at the Dublin airport. I asked 5 different Aer Lingus staff for help and was told 5 different answers. I even spoke to a supervisor who was the worst of all the staff. In the end I missed my flight and had to reschedule. For Dublin to be the home hub for this airline they were the worst people to deal with. The hub in New York at JFK airport was must nicer and professional. The WIFI did not work in the plane and only half of the screens worked. The plane staff even made an announcement about the screens freezing up while watching a movie. The lady in the seat in front of us had a broken seat. It only reclined.

### "a sad excuse for an airline"
Not Verified |  Aer Lingus is a sad excuse for an airline. Not a single of our four flights was on time. We were almost twelve hours late to Paris and had to sit in the Dublin airport all day. There were no employees available to discuss flight details or compensation for delays. The flights also either said they had Wi-Fi but didn’t, or just said flat out they don’t have Wi-Fi. Disastrous airline and I will never fly with them again. Steer clear.

### "Easily one of the worst airlines"
Easily one of the worst airlines I have traveled with. First, the connecting flight did not wait for us even if the origin flight arrived at Dublin on time. Ticket purchased at Aer Lingus, so they have the responsibility to await other connecting passengers as all other major airlines do. Second, and surprisingly the most irritating they never answer the phone of respond to emails. I waited for close to an hour on the phone and 1-1/2 hours waiting for an agent on Chat.

### "This airline is a joke"
Got on the plane and it is so old that there is no USB or outlets. We are burning up because they have no air flow, and we were informed the entertain doesn’t work. It is a 7hr flight. This is outrageous for the price I paid for this ticket. This airline is a joke and I would never recommend it to anyone. First and last time I will fly this airline.

### "involuntarily denied boarding"
Not Verified |  We booked our flight 7 months out and checked in 4 hours early. We were involuntarily denied boarding, causing us to lose 2 days of our vacation. They violated federal policy twice by not including a verbal or written reason as to why we were selected for IDB, and by not asking for volunteers to take a later flight in exchange for compensation. We were thankfully refunded the maximum amount for our flights ($1350 each). However, one of the checks bounced, causing us to incur an additional fee from the bank. Customer service hung up on us after an entire hour on hold and then did not call back. We were last told to open a ticket for the bounced check. We will not be flying with Aer Lingus again.

### "Very positive experience"
Cork to Dubrovnik return. Comfortable aircraft , Cork based crews very chatty and engaging. Legroom good. Cheapest fare allows 10kg checked luggage. This means very few suitcases on board. No fighting for locker space so no mad rush for boarding. Very positive experience at a very good price.

### "customer service is non existent"
Not Verified | If you have to book with them and have no other option please consider buying air tags and if you are traveling with someone make sure you mix the clothing and belongings so that you don’t end up having to buy an entire new closet for your trip. They lost our luggage and it’s been 4 days now without our stuff and the customer service is non existent. I think that maybe a group of mice could better figure out how to locate a lost bag better than these humans. I will never fly with them again and will warn others in the NYC area to do the same.

### "not had a refund 18 months later"
Had booked back 2021 to fly from Manchester to New York via Dublin in September of that year, Aer Lingus then cancelled the flight from Manchester to Dublin and we changed to the direct service that was due to start in November 2021 which was also later cancelled. We opted for a refund and after hundreds of emails and phone calls I have still not had a refund 18 months later. This airline is useless and will never fly with them again!

### "ashamed and embarrassed"
A lovely flight from Dublin to San Francisco - could not fault it. Things went rapidly downhill after that, and Aer Lingus complete lack of regard for paying customers became all to apparent. Our luggage went missing and Aer Lingus have been rude and unhelpful. As a customer I am so disappointed in the customer service provided by my national airline. As an Irish person I'm ashamed and embarrassed to think that other people may be subjected to this treatment. This is not the image I want my national airline to be portraying of Ireland and Irish people. We have a short six day holiday in San Diego; Day 1 is now gone because of Aer Lingus complete and total lack of regard and concern for paying customers. We paid €2808.50 for our flights (2 people) and it is disgusting to think that once they got our money they no longer care. Shame on you Aer Lingus.

### "Lost luggage nightmare"
Not Verified | WORSE THAN SPIRIT AIRLINES! Lost luggage nightmare! This is easily the worst and least helpful airline I’ve ever dealt with. I’d even recommend Spirit Airlines over Aer Lingus. They lost our bags on our recent trip and have no desire to help us get them back. Their customer service is a joke and they are incapable of providing any answers to help us understand when we can expect the bags. Besides this nightmare we’ve experienced, the planes are also small and uncomfortable. Will never fly with them again!

### "would certainly use them again"
Our outbound flight was excellent with no issues and on 10 June for our return flight, I have one big issue and some niggles. For the whole flight, the cabin crew locked off one of the two available toilets. There was nothing wrong with it as the cabin and flight crew used it. Keeping a toilet exclusively for crew use is, in my view, unacceptable. The seat on the A330 is comfortable and I had the best 4 hours of continuous sleep I have ever had in the air. The food offering was, for me, poor except for the snack just after take off with the first drink service. It comprised a pack of five mini, savoury biscuits and a little tub of onion chutney to dip, both of which were delicious and very different from the nuts or pretzels others offer. On the outbound flight, we were offered the traditional juice or champagne prior to take off but no attempt was made to offer this on the inbound flight. The Asian-style beef at dinner had little of the Orient about it. I didn't try the dessert or either of the starters. IFE was available but very limited choice compared to many other carriers. Finally the complimentary wi-fi was somehow not available on this leg but you could pay. Outbound no problem a voucher was given shortly after boarding. Okay, quite a bit of whinging there, and apart from the very comfortable seat the only other positive was that despite delayed take off on both legs the plane arrive on time or a little early. I would certainly use them again for this route though as too few Manchester to the USA options are available.

### "Never again will I fly Aer Lingus"
We booked a ten-day tour of Ireland thru Trafalgar Tours. The tour started 19 May 2023. We wanted to arrive early and see some of Dublin before the tour started so we booked an Aer Lingus flight from Orlando Florida to Dublin on the 17th of May. Our flight was due to depart at 8:30 PM and arrive in Dublin at 9:30 AM on the 18th of May. (Aer Lingus Flt. 120). We were told that the incoming equipment had been delayed and that we would depart at 9:30 PM. The incoming aircraft arrived shortly after 9 PM followed by a fire truck! We were told we would depart at 10;30 then, 11:30. this went on till 2 AM on the 18th. They said the flight was canceled, but we would be boarded in the morning as soon as the aircraft was repaired. Imagine 300 people scrambling to get their checked luggage and make their way to the check in desk to get a hotel voucher (we found out that they booked the hotel rooms at 9:00 PM that night), madness. We got to the hotel at 4:30 AM. We had three hours sleep and returned to the airport to see if our plane had been repaired, it hadn't. we were told we would be boarding Aer Lingus flight 34 for Manchester, England at 5:45 PM. We arrived in Manchester at 7:20 AM on the 19th of May. Our connecting flight (Aer Lingus 3327) to Dublin did not leave till 5:45 PM that night. We arrived in Dublin at 6:40 PM. We arrived 33 hours late. We had paid for a hotel room in Dublin for the night of the 18 that we didn't get to use, and we missed the complete first day of our tour. We filed a claim with Aer Lingus for $ 600 each for me and my wife per EU rules. We also asked for $220 for the hotel room we had paid for, $174 for meals and $800 for the first day of the tour that we missed out on. They have offered us $147 in total compensation although they are responsible for our losses. Never again will I fly Aer Lingus or say a good word about them.

### "Aer Lingus the new Ryanair"
Not Verified |  Had a connecting flight from Heathrow to Shannon. Flight was suddenly cancelled. I was told very rudely, you have 2 options, sit in the airport for 17 hours until tomorrow or move to Dublin. But you will then have to have a 3 hour bus journey to Shannon. What is so frustrating is this is a very regular occurrence, receive no apologies, then was made sit on the runway for 2+ hours without being able to purchase so much as a chocolate bar. I have been running from gate to gate like a headless chicken and have has no time to stop for some food. I'm starving. No we cannot give you anything to eat/buy until we are in the air". Waited ages for flight then bus to take off, rushed again, no toilet on bus or time to run to shop. No where to charge phone to arrange a lift. 3 hour cold bus journey starved after that. Awful experience, will never fly Aer Lingus again. Obvious lies all the time, excuses for everything that were not even good ones. We got a free plastic glass of water from a 2 litre bottle and at no stage when people complained did anyone say 'Sorry'. Ryanair has become the new Aer Lingus and Aer Lingus the new Ryanair. Lots of extras costs to be as a result. Aer Lingus will regularly cancel Heathrow to Shannon on a Monday if the flight is not full to save them some $. Unethical!

### "didn't deliver what I paid for"
Not Verified | I booked round-trip from Boston (BOS) to Amsterdam (AMS). Then I paid $500 extra to change to round-trip from Hartford (BDL) to Amsterdam (AMS) when Aer Lingus started flying out of BDL. Six hours before the flight, Aer Lingus cancelled BDL and had me fly out of BOS. I asked them to change the return flight to BOS since my car would be parked there. They said that would be another upcharge, which I refused. I requested a refund of the $500 since they didn't deliver what I paid for. They rejected the request. So on top of the $500, I had to buy an Amtrak ticket from Hartford to Boston to get my car and pay for two extra days of parking at BOS. This is unacceptable. I urge anyone considering Aer Lingus to reconsider.

### "absence of an apology"
On May 6 flight , I was flying in Business Class from Dublin to Boston. I had expected an exceptional level of service, comfort, and attention to detail. Regrettably, my experience fell far short of these expectations. when I received my meal onboard. To my dismay, I discovered a disturbing bug in one of the dishes. This discovery was not only highly unappetizing but also raised serious concerns about the hygiene and quality control standards. Such a glaring oversight in food preparation is simply unacceptable. What adds insult to injury is the complete lack of acknowledgment or apology from any representative of the airline. I was astounded by the disregard for customer satisfaction and the absence of any effort to rectify the situation or offer an explanation. The absence of an apology or any form of follow-up after such a distressing incident further compounds my disappointment.

### "have concerns over the baggage fees"
Aer Lingus – Flight E1 178 on 4th June 2023. Dublin to London Heathrow. I shall start this review by firstly referring to the online booking experience. While the website is clear the added on fees such as seat selection and charges for baggage leave a bitter taste. I was livid to see that some passengers brought aboard bags larger than the one I paid to have in the hold based on the online information. Boarding was not efficient as there was no priority boarding for needy categories of passengers. Moreover the person checking & scanning the boarding pass did not even make eye contact and was using her mobile phone with one hand while scanning boarding passes with the other! This is unprofessional and something I have not seen before! Most of the cabin crew had a low profile with the exception of one very hard working lady who went above and beyond to assist and elderly couple. It was nice that some announcements were made in the Irish language as well as in English. The flight arrived ahead of schedule and disembarkation was efficient but again cabin crew other than the same hard working lady were invisible. The flight was operated by an A320 neo. This was ideal for such a short but very busy flight. The captain made clear announcements and safety was taken seriously. I would use Aer Lingus again but have concerns over the baggage fees.

### "this airline is horrible"
They didn’t put our golf clubs on our flight on both legs to and from Edinburgh to Dublin. They lied and said they were on the flights when asked. We watched them unload them. We took photos of this. We had AirTags in our bags and were able to track. They constantly lied to us about them looking for them. They make you fill out a report and you never hear from them again. Through a third party we were able to have our clubs picked up, without the airline even knowing. The customer service staff is ignorant and unhelpful. Very unprofessional all the way the senior person who just couldn’t be bothered and didn’t care. There were 8 of us and this happened to 7 of 8. Worst flying experience. Everyone we spoke to in Edinburgh said this was a regular occurrence with this airline. If we didn’t have the AirTags we would have been out our clubs. Find another option, this airline is horrible.

### "My flight was delayed by 3 hours"
My flight was delayed by 3 hours which made me miss my bus home which is 4 hours from Dublin. I then had to wait an hour after arriving in Dublin to get another bus that wasn’t even going to my home, it stopped 40 mins away so I had to arrange for someone to pick me up from there. I’m very disappointed with there service and have never been as stressed in my life and I didn’t think I was going to make it home.

### "over 12 hours of delay"
Our flight from Chicago to Dublin was delayed and our connecting flight to Zürich did not wait in Dublin. No big deal, we thought. Usually airlines would route us to the final destination without much fuss. Not the case with aer Lingus. Aer Lingus doesn’t have relationship with most major airlines. So you are presented with very limited choices. Our best case alternative routing presented was over 12 hours of delay from the original time. We even asked for a direct connection the next day but they didn’t have flights to Zürich on Sunday. So the next flight was two days away. We took the alternate route they provided. We were not provided any compensation or voucher. We had to take the checked bags out at Ireland and go through immigration to get the rebooking done and had to check in afresh again. They provided boarding passes only until Amsterdam and not to the final destination Zürich. The baggage tag was also to Amsterdam. I raised concern over that. The agent said we should collect our bags again at Amsterdam and recheck and collect boarding passes at Amsterdam at KLM counter. The flight to Amsterdam was delayed by two hours. When we reached Amsterdam, we had to go through immigration and collect the bags again. We did that and when we went to check in the bags, we were told that their system doesn’t show that we paid for the bags and we have to pay again. We paid for 30 kg check in bags. Due to Aer Lingus's fault, we now have to pay again for the baggage (55 euro) and an excess baggage fee of 75 euro. Not only that, we had to visit six different counters to get this issue resolved. We spent well over four hours going from counter to counter with kids and bags. Klm staff asked us to pay them and seek reimbursement from aer lingus. When we contacted aer Lingus via them WhatsApp business account, they asked to register a case at their website and provided a link. After filling out all the details meticulously, the form crashes with a server error. Wow. Please don’t ruin your trip / vacation flying Aer Lingus.

### "Amazing customer service"
Amazing customer service at the gate. I missed my original flight though my own error and the gentleman at the gate couldn’t have been nicer put me on the next flight to London with no hesitation and no judgement. I’m so appreciative to have been treated this way. Thank you Aer Lingus.

### "our luggage has not been located"
Not Verified | There are lots of choices when booking a flight. We happened to be celebrating a milestone wedding anniversary and booked a trip to Italy. The flight itself was fine. We arrived at the airport in Naples and were the only passengers on a flight of 300+ people to be standing at the baggage carousel when it shut down because all the bags had been picked up by the passengers except for us. Our bags were missing. So now we head over to the missing baggage window and fill out a missing baggage claim form. This is Sunday morning. We make our way to the hotel with the clothes on our back for a week long stay to celebrate our anniversary not sure where our luggage is. We are tired. We have been on two flights for 10 hours. We wake up the next morning and put on the same clothes we arrived in to get breakfast. Never mind that there are new outfits in our luggage that we purchased for this trip that are floating around somewhere. After calling Aer Lingus multiple times and being told our luggage is out for delivery, we logged on to their missing baggage website only to learn our luggage has not been located yet in spite of Aer Lingus agents lying and telling us on the phone our bags were on the way. Was this so we wouldn’t go out and purchase necessary items to change into to keep Aer Lingus lost baggage costs lower. We are now in our 3rd full day in Italy and Aer Lingus still stands by their claim that one bag is out for delivery, when the truth of the matter is they can’t specify where it is en route. This saga will probably continue for us long after we depart Italy in two days. To add insult to injury, Aer Lingus cannot tell us what is acceptable and necessary that we can purchase while we wait hopelessly for our luggage. Talk about being given the run around, reading from a computer screen that the bags are in route, escalating our calls to supervisors who only read the same script on a screen. My Advice to Everyone out there - DO NOT BOOK YOUR FLIGHT through Aer Lingus if you value the peace of mind that you are entrusting a company that values it’s customers and will make a sincere effort to correct an error in a timely and honest manner. Let’s face it, a lot of people are like us, we don’t travel all the time, we spent thousands of hard earned dollars, and to be in Europe for going on four days in the same skivvies we arrived in should not be tolerated by customers - so book with another airlines if you value peace of mind.

### "I am happy to spend money with them"
Not Verified |  I travel a lot for my job and have lived in several different countries and so regularly use many different airlines. Although Aer Lingus are not always perfect, in my opinion they are one of the better and more reliable airlines today. They are reasonably quick to refund when there has been a problem, reasonably fair in their assessments of grievances and generally better at professional communication than most. There's definitely room for improvement but overall I am happy to spend money with them as I have seen they care about the quality of their services when it matters the most, i.e. when there has been a problem.

### "we are left to our own devices"
Welcome to post covid travel! I can accept many things, especially because of covid. Airline flights cancelled, lack of full staff, the list goes on. So, for this summer expect a whole lot of cancelled flights. So lets look at what a cancelled flight looks like in this post covid era. First off you'll get a message that your flight is delayed. Ok, so we'll just hang out in the club lounge a little longer, have a bite to eat, a beverage and just relax. Maybe an hour later check on how the flight is going and oh my! The gate looks like a scene at a border crossing: Its humid, its hot, there are people laying on the ground, babies are crying. Real hell on earth...well back to club for me! Then 3 hours after our plane should have left they announce flight cancelled. I go the gate and again see a scene of human misery, that's passengers I'm talking about, not Aer Lingus employees, they've booked it for the exits and gone home (probably high-fiving each other with, 'great job today!'). So we are left to our own devices and somehow all wonder to check-in like zombies out of a horror film (and the babies are still crying). An hour passes (it's now 10pm and we have been at the airport since 3pm) and word filters down that our luggage is in baggage claim. Off we all go to pick up our luggage (picture zombies trudging with a suitcase (and I wonder how those zombies with babies picked up their luggage?) Again we are at check-in with no Aer Lingus staff. Finally at 11pm someone who is not Aer Lingus starts to sort through this misery and give us direction, hotel, call this number, etc. And now for the zinger, not once, not at any time did any Aer Lingus staff show any humanity for the 3 or 6 month old babies that were crying. I saw one mother patiently comforting her baby in stoic solitude, showing her character and instilling in her baby what true character is. This is what I saw and learned that night and what I saw from Aer Lingus? Not a damn thing!

### "shoddy customer service"
The security is amazing so quick it's almost worth the way you are treated on the flight, almost. Going from Dublin to LA we had a engine fault. Totally get it - it could happen to any good airline. We were trapped on the flight for one and a half hours before air conditioning could be turned on. Then we were freezing. After a two hour delay we were off. This was my first long haul with Aer Lingus post covid - a lot has changed. The bar came round once! What you are not told is there is no complementary wine with your meal just a tiny tiny cup of water. Luckily for me I ordered two drinks to see me through to past dinner. Food was OK - as soon as dinner was served the cabin staff disappeared and I mean disappeared! I found them all about 5 hours later literally hiding in the galley. I asked if I could purchase a bottle of water ( gone are the heady days when someone quietly came round the cabin asking if anyone required water on an 11 hour flight) no we have no bottles I was told. Some one took pity on me and gave me one from business class. As a walked back to my seat clutching my bottle other travellers gasped with cracked lips "where did you get that" that was going to LA on way back exactly the same issues only I told the line to buy water before boarding. We landed in Dublin to something described as a breakfast burrito (it was hell on earth) and to add insult to injury we were not even offered a coffee! Shame on you Aer Lingus, shoddy shoddy customer service - in case anyone is wondering it was a £750 ticket. This is definitely what I would call a no frills air line. Funnily enough I was offered a coffee to purchase from Dublin to Edinburgh. Too little too late absolutely shameful.

### "I felt like I was in economy"
Never again. Paid megabucks for business class. No welcome on board drinks, e.g. champagne, orange etc offered. No drinks trolley coming round offering drinks throughout the flight, the only drink I was offered was with my meal. No duty free offered. No food came around until about one hour into the flight, it seemed as though they heated one meal at a time. Slow is an understatement. On our outward flight, of the 30 seats in business class, there were only 13 seats occupied, yet I still could not have the meal I wanted as they had run out? Food was bland and uninteresting. The staff seemed to be just doing as little as possible, not interested, not friendly at all to anyone really. Got a code for free wifi in Business Class, it did not work, so no free wifi. At JFK when we were boarding our flight, which was delayed by an hour and forty minutes, a ground crew member attempted to open the barrier to allow economy class ticket holders with buggy/prams to board before anyone else did, until another staff member told her that business class passengers should be boarding first. Apart from the roomy and comfortable seat, I felt like I was in economy. Note to Aer Lingus....take some lessons from Virgin and BA, they are not brilliant but miles better compared to the joke that is Aer Lingus. I will not be flying in business or any other seats with them ever again.

### "ground crew was rude beyond imagination"
Not Verified |  They have gone downhill since Covid. I used to be happy with Aer Lingus pre Covid. But now this airline is a complete waste of money and time. The plane was dirty. The tables have not been cleaned, butter and coke was sticking on it. There was no pocket on the seat. But the biggest failure were the staff at Dublin airport. The ground crew was rude beyond imagination. The woman at the gate yelled at me and others, ripped my boarding pass out of my hand and was really disrespectful. That was not what I was paying for. The other staff were fairly disinterested in service of any kind. Felt like they have a miserable job so anyone else should have to suffer. This was the last time for me traveling with Aer Lingus. There is no value traveling Aer Lingus anymore and I strongly recommend choosing a proper airline. Sorry Aer Lingus, but it is in your hands.

### "complete rudeness in general"
Complete dog water brain of an airline. Unprofessional ground AND air staff. User interface on airline app is shocking. Completely unprofessional behaviour of staff. Treat customers like cattle on the airplane. Literally had a stewardess push her whole body behind me saying 'please quickly take your seat' when there was clearly other passengers in front of me. Ground staff - on top of being completely incompetent, always have a 'I hate my job and my life so everyone else has to be miserable too' type attitude. Completely disregard customer personal space and complete rudeness in general. DO NOT RECOMMEND

### "Cabin crew and boarding team are not professional"
Crew in the airport were not helpful at all, I arrived to the airport 1h before my flight on 10/5/2023 because of an emergency, but the Aer Lingus boarding staff in Dublin airport terminal 2 didn’t understand or try to help even though I had no bag to check in, basically all I had to do is to head directly to the plane, but he didn't want that to happen. I had to pay 300GBP extra to buy a new ticket and the new flight got delayed. Cabin crew and boarding team are not professional at all, rude and not helpful. Not recommend at all and you can‘t compare them with any other respected air lines like Emirates or Qatar.

### "Very pleasant staff"
Just flown Dublin to Alicante. Couldn't find a fault. Very pleasant staff on ground and in the air, but I still think hold luggage costs are are pure theft.

### "they've gone so downhill"
Not Verified |  I use to recommend Are Lingus pre covid they had amazing customer service. After COVID they've gone so downhill that it is insane! I flew with them last summer our flights were an absolute mess! They rearranged our seats without our permission, contacted them and were told it was fixed back took hours but it was fine. Ended up being rearranged again again without our permission again had to call in and were told it was fixed. When we arrived in Dublin for our transfer one of the family members was put on a completely different flight at a completely different time. The staff in Dublin were rude, they said there was nothing they could do at the gate and we'd have to leave the gate and go to the main desk at the office. After waiting for almost 2hrs because two other non-related flights got cancelled and they only had two people working the desk we were told there was nothing they could do and they don't know why one person was switched even though we had our email confirmations and they could see all the previous flights made. I followed up with their customer service team because this was ridiculous after months they offer a mediocre voucher for our experience. It is been 7 months and I've yet to see this voucher. I've called multiple times and each time they say there's an open case but no supervisor is available to address it at the moment and they'll leave a note on the file.

### "the online booking is a joke"
Not Verified |  I am flying in May, but after dealing with the airline I have great doubts about it. First off the online booking is a joke because they do not update their fares so by the time (5 minutes) you try to pay...you are unable to. Then you try to do it via the phone and all you get are non native English speaking "service reps", who can not understand you and you can't understand them (FYI I flew as a second office on a regional so I know my diction is good). I am fully expecting the same on the flight.

### "announcement spoken too rapidly"
Not Verified |  Very efficient, friendly. Only comment I would like to make is that the announcements by Cabin Crew were not clear. Each announcement was spoken too rapidly. As if there was a race on.! No sense of style. Just rush, rush, rush. Diction was very difficult to understand, particularly with male cabin crew on London /Shannon. Each word rushed into next. Just could not decipher what was being said. The spoken word can be beautiful, even if it is an instruction. A few seconds to pronounce what one is saying can make a difference I believe.

### "No value in this airline"
cAircraft wouldn’t start at Gatwick resulting in a two hour delay and missing my connection to Orlando. I was then rerouted via JFK which was also 2hrs behind getting me into my hotel at 02:30 instead of 9pm. On the return trip from Orlando to Heathrow via Dublin again the flight was 2hrs late resulting in a missed connection again and a late arrival into LHR. I paid extra for legroom and window seating which I lost on two legs. When I asked about the seats they said send an email!! Their check in staff at Orlando spent more time on their cell phones than dealing with customers. Even though the lines were long they didn’t care. No value in this airline at all don’t waste your money.

### "Absolutely shocking service"
Absolutely shocking service. If I ran my company the way they did, I’d be out of business. Our flight was due to leave at 18.05, they waited until 18.25 to say the flight was cancelled and couldn’t get us on another flight until the following day. We were then told to head back to baggage collection to collect our cases, and proceed to check-in to arrange the hotel. This would have been straightforward if they hadn’t made us wait 2.5 hours to get our bags back. We then had to make our way to the hotel, most of that was guess work, only to find out our so called food voucher wasn’t available for use in any of the hotel restaurants. They tried to palm us off with either fish or curry in a separate room and it wasn’t being served until after 21:30. Travelling with children, this really isn’t a fair deal. We were then informed we had been transferred onto the 06:30 flight the following morning, I mean come on, not eating until after 21:30 with children, then trying to sort cases etc and be up for 03:30 the following morning to make the flight, absolute joke! To make things even more hilarious, my friend was travelling on the Aer Lingus flight to Glasgow around the same time we were due to fly, they were 20 mins from landing and they turned back due to a technical fault. So travelling back 40 minutes was safer than the 20 mins to Glasgow!! Clearly they don’t want to have a plane stranded in Glasgow, as it would cost more than the inconvenience to the full flight of passengers.

### "Scam airline"
Scam airline. Announced 1 hour before departure that the airplane had a “technical” problem. Though clear to us that there weren’t enough passengers. Miraculously, enough seats available on the Boston flight 2 hours later - except for the very unlucky 8 people at the end of the line, who got a hotel voucher and big sorry. Basically they are canceling transatlantic flights and stuffing other flights.

### "I will never fly Aer Lingus again"
Not Verified |  I have used Aer Lingus for decades and my last 3 experiences has been extremely bad. Me and my wife flew back for a relatives funeral and upon or return Aer Lingus canceled our flight and changed our flight with out notifying us. I paid extra for a direct flight, almost double to be exact, and they forced me on a connecting flight to Hartford, Connecticut, and we had to get a bus from Hartford to Newark. I was told it was only going to take 2 hours and because it’s under a 3 hour delay they would not comp us on anything whatsoever. The supervisor at Dublin airport was not helpful, just had an attitude when I tried to explain or situation and would not give us any alternative flights. I will never fly Aer Lingus again they don’t care for customers.

### "a low-cost basic experience"
There was nothing wrong with the flight itself per-se - it took off and landed on time, generally calm. Terminal 2 security at Heathrow was calm, although amenities and shops quite poor - since Boots closed, you can't buy water anywhere for less than £2 which is extortionate. Boarding felt a bit early, but we didn't take off at departure time as it was quite slow - this was because there was only one gate agent checking in everyone including premium passengers and those requiring assistance, although automatic gates were used. Seats were above average comfortable for short-haul, on the way our was old-style so more padding and quite comfortable but on the way back was slimline but fine for an hours flight time - strangely the seat pocket in front had been sewn up so no where to store small belongings, which felt a tad low-cost despite the premium prices charged for this flight. Cabin-crew weren't especially warm and friendly and seemed rather unmotivated, they did pass through the cabin quickly offering the buy-on-board snacks and drinks but no menu was offered and it was almost like it was just a formality and seemed a bit surprised or put-out that some people actually wanted any like my neighbour in my seat. Buy-on-board products didn't look good quality from looking online, felt very expensive for what they were in comparison to other carriers. My biggest issue though is Aer Lingus charge quite a premium to fly with them against the only other carrier they compete with between the two cities, so they're not anywhere near cheap - yet it feels like a low-cost basic experience. I think even a complimentary snack and some water is the least the should offer as their sister airline BA now do in short-haul economy given the premium charge. I would fly with them again only if they were the only better option as on this route.

### "FAs were helpful but firm"
Not Verified |  Nothing to write home about. Seats were a bit cramped, food tasted bland, no free alcoholic beverages on my flight (which I had previously assumed was standard on trans Atlantic flights but maybe I am mistaken). FAs were helpful but firm, IFE options left some to be desired. We got these tickets for ~$400 less than the closest competitor however, so I suppose we definitely got what we paid for. Dublin airport transfer was painless and second leg (Dublin to Paris) was a short breeze.

### "So unprofessional and unethical"
I pay GBP412 for 4 passengers - Heathrow to Belfast - this fare includes 63 pounds for extra legroom seats and 112 pounds for 25kg checked baggage x 4. Aer Lingus can no longer provide this service - they booked us onto a British Airways flight but on the 'cheap' seats - with hand baggage only, to the value of approximately GBP150 pounds for all 4 of us. There were checked baggage options available as I asked BA and it still would have only cost 215 pounds compared to the 412 I paid Aer Lingus. Now Aer Lingus reuse to refund me the extra legroom and checked baggage fees. I have to pay again to BA to have 25kg checked baggage x 4 and extra legroom seats are now not available. They take your money, can't provide a service, refuse a reasonable request for refunds, book you on a third of the price seats/flight and pocket my change. Their terms and conditions are the seats/tickets are non refundable - I understand this however my seats / tickets with Aer Lingus are non existent so how do these rubbish non refundable terms and conditions apply to a non existent service? As you can imagine - they can't or WON'T answer that. Their email to me said an alternative flight or refund - I requested the refund and of course was ignored. So unprofessional and unethical and such poor customer service! You should be ashamed of your greedy selves.

### "shockingly bad customer service"
From the moment we purchased tickets, we had the most shockingly bad customer service. Be aware: you can do nothing online, including book or change seats and must call Customer Service for everything. They do not respond to emails, customer service is outsourced to overseas Indian or Eastern European countries where some do not speak English well enough to answer your query. They always say you have to email but you never receive a response (this after 24 emails over 3 mths and no responses). We flew business and they ran out of food. They offered economy meals. Flight attendants clearly did not like their jobs. The food (when you did manage to get any) was horrible and it was next to impossible to get a second drink, even water. Finally, we arrived in SFO to hear my husband's name called - they put my bag on the flight from Dublin but not his. We were leaving and checked through from Paris. They promised it would arrive next day, next flight. 10 days later it is still listed as tracking and in Dublin. We phoned several times to be told it was still in Dublin as far as they could see. We went several times to the airport and checked Lost Luggage -also finally went a 3rd day to see the same flight coming in and found a helpful man on security who phoned around. He left to go to an 'office' and came out with our bag. Fully tagged. It is still listed as 'being tracked'. We have contacted Aer Lingus to advise this but still listed as being in Dublin. . This has been one of the most horrible airlines we have ever flown.

### "notorious for losing people’s luggage"
Not Verified |  Aer Lingus have lost my luggage, not once, not twice, but 3 times! All 3 times I have flown on them from Washington DC to Glasgow, they have lost my luggage while transiting Dublin. I arrived in Glasgow on Wednesday morning, and I still haven’t received my luggage today, 4 days later. I leave the UK on Thursday 1/12. Just ridiculous, when I call the number for missing bags, I got through to a woman who was completely unhelpful and vague as ever. She told that my bags were out for delivery and have been out for delivery for 24 hours now, and they still haven’t arrived. Aer Lingus are notorious for losing people’s luggage

### "Never fly with Aer Lingus"
Lost my luggage, dishonest and ignored. Ruined a family Christmas in New York. You can see from other reviews, losing luggage has become a habit with this airline so you would have hoped that they would have a better way of dealing with it by now. Unfortunately, there is no help whatsoever and they couldn’t have cared less. We return to the UK tomorrow. Who knows if we will ever see our luggage again. Never fly with Aer Lingus.

### "I don't have my luggage"
Not Verified |  I travelled from Canada to Birmingham via Dublin. Worst worst customer service .At the airport we found all our luggage was lost, we were asked to file the missing luggage form, and was told we might get it the same day. No further instructions. Until today 2days after, I don't have my luggage. Calling airport, customer service no reply, line busy but never got through. Worst airport and airlines. I am pregnant and I have a 2 year old kid. My medication and my son they are all in the luggage. No clothes to wear, have to do some shopping on my own expense . I was not told anything if I can claim or whatever. I have travel insurance but was told by the officer at the airport no need to claim. I am traveling to another country tomorrow but still no luggage. This is so unprofessional. I wish I read reviews before booking with this airlines. Never travelling with them nor will I refer them.

### "still haven't received the refund"
Not Verified |  I was flying back to Raleigh from Spain on Aer Lingus with stops in Dublin and Boston. However when I got to Dublin Aer Lingus had a system failure so all their EU flights were canceled but they were still pushing out the flights to the US. My flight got delayed 3 times however we finally boarded but about 30-40 minutes after boarding and right when the air hostess were giving the safety instructions they got a call from the pilot and couple minutes later the Pilot announced that the flight couldn't take off because he would go over the amount of flying time he can legally complete. When the flight was canceled it was around 11 pm and they promised to give us a hotel and reimburse us for finding new flights. They did not find us new flights we had to find them ourselves and they didn't provide us with accommodations. I ended up sleeping on the floor of the airport over night and spent at least 30 hours in the airport because of this whole ordeal. To this day I still haven't received the refund or the reimbursement for finding a new flight and it is now 2.5 months later. I understand that they would have been understaffed and thrown off guard when the system crashed but no staff member that I talked to seemed like they wanted to help. I reached out to their customer service about rebooking my flight they didn't get back to me 2 days after I got back to the states about rebooking my flight.

### "Wouldn't fly them again"
My experience with Aer Lingus was not very good. The airline was a step above a budget airline. Here's what was average the seats, the onboard service, and the entertainment options. The airline meals were tiny and hardly filled you up. The wifi did not work on any of our flights. However, it was upon arriving in Dublin that our problems began. We had a three hour delay due to "weather" despite the fact that the sun was shining and there was almost zero snow or ice on the ground. It took hours for them to de-ice the plane which is the airlines responsibility. The ground crew never told any of the passengers what was happening or how long we could expect to be delayed. The zero communication was very frustrating. The short flight to London had no complementary beverages of any sort despite the long delay. On our return flight to the U.S., in the Gatwick airport there was a single gate agent checking in 80+ passengers. We stood in line for almost an hour. Why Aer Lingus? We almost missed our flight despite arriving to the airport two hours early. The airline's apps and online website never worked and we were unable to check in before we arrived to the airport which meant we were confined to the very last row on the plane. Wouldn't fly them again unless it was super super cheap or there were no other options.

### "couldn’t care less about customers"
Not Verified | Could not check in, thanks to an aggressive, dismissive, I couldn’t care less about customers employee. This employee refused to make a small correction on my boarding pass that others have done before without any problem. She was aggressive, stated several times that it was not her job to help customers, she didn’t have time to waste and did not care. Missed my flight, my business meeting and had to buy another ticket from another company. Avoid at any cost!

### "avoid Aer Lingus at all costs"
Not Verified |  Just a general warning to avoid Aer Lingus at all costs. Their planes are very old, felt like I was in a 70’s film. That didn’t bother me at all but just thought I’d note that. The main problem was the constant delays. Sure there was a issue with ice when the plane was en route to Chicago so it got delayed which is understandable. However this delay was not made known to anyone on the flight and after the gate changing 3 times and 4 hours after the plane was supposed to take off did the counter staff arrive and make an announcement of the delay which would cause my partner and I to miss our connection on Aer Lingus as well to Portugal. I called customer service 4 times, waited on hold for a total of 3 hrs only to be hung up on all 4 times and told to call Alaska who we booked through, though each time Alaska told us Aer Lingus has to make the changes and Aer Lingus refused to make the changes when Alaska told us Aer Lingus had to do it. Ended up having to make the change in Dublin airport. Overall awful experience.

### "Flight was delayed multiple times"
Flight was delayed multiple times, at first it was going hour to hour then two hours. Ticketing agent disappeared for hours with no one to ask about updates. All tracking information for the flight disappeared from all trackers leaving the entire passenger list to wonder what the hell was going on. We were told the delays were due to weather but planes have been coming and going from this airport over the last 6 hours I have been waiting to board this flight. Would be nice to provide an update at least hourly.

### "Uncomfortable seats with very small leg room"
Flight got canceled, re routed with a long stop over. Luggage got misplaced, I was asked to report later. Uncomfortable seats with very small leg room and I’m not even a tall guy.

### "refused to issue a refund"
They canceled the flight a day before departure, then refused to issue a refund, not once, but twice. Awful airline, avoid at all costs.

### "cabin crew are just awful"
Not Verified |  Having had our fight cancelled from Shannon on the 19th Nov 2022, we flew from Dublin the following day. Aer Lingus were very good about the cancellation and looked after us well though communication was not great following the cancelled flight. The cabin crew served the most awful food I have ever had on a flight. The chicken meal I asked for was only lukewarm and since I didn't want to risk being ill on my holiday I decided not to eat it. Later they served coffee, I asked a cabin crew member for sugar and he completely ignored me, I assumed he didn't hear me and repeated my request, he immediately said I am dealing with something in a rude and aggressive manner, I was so embarrassed, even the people sitting next to me remarked on him. We flew back to Ireland on the 28th October on the 18.55 flight. We got a cereal bar and orange juice for breakfast, my husband asked for coffee following breakfast and was told that the captain said coffee was not to be served due to turbulence! We were certainly not advised about turbulence. We will never fly Aer Lingus again if we can possibly avoid it. Terrible. The cabin crew are just awful, rude and have complete disregard their captive customers!

### "telling me I would be fully reimbursed"
Not Verified |  Atrocious. +6 hour delays. Left stranded in the connecting airport due to the delay, causing us to miss our connecting flight. No customer assistance in getting to our final destination. Had to book my own alternate flight on my own dime. Awful customer service. Still haven't gotten my money back 2 months after the flight, despite all the airline people telling me I would be fully reimbursed while I was stranded. The planes are old with broken infotainment systems.

### "disgusted with this airline"
Absolutely disgusted with this airline. The pilot allowed a group of drunk people on board - utterly ridiculous decision. After sitting around for 2-3 hours, the flight was cancelled, at 23.55. No staff available to provide help/support to customers. Alternative flight not offered. Earliest flight I could get was with Ryanair at £644! Lost a day's income. Aer Lingus offered EUR 87! Not nearly enough to compensate for loss of income/cost of flight, cost of taxi.

### "Absolutely disgusting airline"
Absolutely disgusting airline. If I ever had to use them again I would sooner not go on holiday. Food not good. Lack of snacks, only soft drinks included, no wine List goes on. That’s before I start on the delays.

### "doesn't give a damn about customers"
Not Verified |  London to Dublin with Aer Lingus on July 09, 2022. Arrived in Dublin, no luggage to be found. Baggage area was utter chaos as dozens of people were searching for their luggage. Submitted online baggage claim forms as directed. No airline personnel around to assist anyone. Subsequently made clothing and personal item purchases....nothing extravagant, just enough to get through the week. Via e-mail was directed to screen shot receipts for reimbursement. Seven weeks later, reimbursed for less than half the amount and was informed via e-mail there was a minimum by law. Really? The amount was shameful, not to mention no reimbursement for lost items in luggage. It is now October 22, 2022. No further communication rom Aer Lingus electronically or by phone. I wrote a hand written letter to the airline customer vice president in Jericho, NY a month ago - no response, same to the V.P. in Dublin. No response. This, sadly, was the only overseas trip I have ever taken in my life and it was ruined. Aer Lingus simply doesn't give a damn about customers.

### "nothing like the old Aer Lingus I loved flying"
I booked and purchased tickets for an Aer Lingus trip in October 2021. BOS-SNN-LHR June 15 22 Returning from Paris CDG-DUB-BOS on June 28 22. The outward flights were uneventful. usual 30min delay in Boston, poor quality food in coach. I liked the new A321NEO to Shannon much more comfortable than the old 757. However the return was hell. We arrived at the counter at CDG to total chaos after waiting in line for an hour we got to to an agent a contractor (Swissport?) she told us we didn't have a reservation so I gave her our number she then said the BOS flight is cancelled. But I pointed out that the previous customer is on the same flight and they got passes for both flights. She then said our reservations were cancelled by Aer Lingus and we would have to make our own arrangements to get home. I asked for the duty Manager who told me the same thing and suggested I call customer service. I made her call customer service and she got us on a BA to LHR and AA to BOS the next day. But No hotel or meals. I had to find a hotel on my own using a tablet on airport wifi. When we got back I submitted a claim for EU261 Compensation with Aer Lingus on July 1 Ref #8333779. I got an Ack for this the next day and have heard nothing since although I have inquired of status several times by Email. eventually I got thru to someone who said they are still working on the issue and to expect to hear soon - this was on Sept 30-still waiting. I have a Vacation home in Kirush Clare Ireland So i guess I will be using Delta or Icelandair in future. In conclusion you have to be crazy to fly this airline. They are definitely nothing like the old Aer Lingus I loved flying.

### "pay for drinks on transatlantic flight"
Worst customer service ever, my food was disgusting and had to pay for drinks on transatlantic flight. Cabin crew were rude to me. Worst airlines ever

### "Terrible airline and service"
Not Verified |  I couldn't believe there was only 1 working bathroom with over 150 passengers and also every flight was asked if I would like a beverage I said a coke and after she opened the can she asked for a 2.50 payment. I was under the impression that beverages were complimentary since I paid 1500$ for this flight. Terrible airline and service.

### "customer service is trash"
Checked in both of us for our flight the next day via the app. No issues obtaining my husband's boarding pass, however for some reason mine was completely inaccessible both on the app and website, and the agents available via Chat on the Aer Lingus website may as well just be bots, given they clearly just copy/paste template excuses rather than actually making any means of an attempt to help customers. No semblance of an explanation or effort given to help, whatsoever. Now when we get to the airport in the morning we'll be forced to wait in the check-in line for absolutely no good reason in addition to all of the others. Way to punish a paying customer for your own site and mobile app's shortcomings, Aer Lingus customer service is trash.

### "avoid at any cost"
Not Verified | Worst Airline I have ever traveled with. I travel extensively internationally and have seen it all. They left 45 minutes late due to baggage loading issues (no other explanation provided). Our connecting flight from Dublin to Edinburgh was delayed by 1 hour no explanation provided. Our bags never arrived - they somehow were sent to London! The luggage counter in Edinburgh is not manned - it’s subcontracted out to another company who makes you fill out a form but no one seems to know what next! Finally figured out a web based link for reporting missing bags etc. when we landed in Dublin from an overnight flight from Philadelphia no breakfast/tea or coffee was served! I won’t travel Aer Fungus even if were free. No respect/accommodation for passengers - avoid at any cost.

### "I have not received any refund"
Not Verified |  I had to cancel my tickets and I have not received any refund, though I was promised an 85% refund. I have to wait two or three hours on hold for their customer service staff. After the long wait, I receive no real information about the status of my refund. I was told that it will take two weeks to receive the refund. Another time I was told that it will four to six weeks. It have been 9 weeks since I cancelled my tickets. The last time I contacted Aer Lingus customer service, I was promised that the "refund team" would contact me via email within 24 hours. That did not happen. I have requested the refund using the Aer Lingus web site also. No one has acknowledged that my request has been received.

### "terrible customer service"
Delayed bags and terrible customer service. First and last time I will ever fly Aer Lingus. Medication‘s in the bag they’ve supposedly been out for delivery for two days but nobody can give me any real information because the folks are in call centers in Asia. I’m solo traveling I don’t have my medication I’m supposed to check out today and take a train to another country so now I don’t know whether to spend my own money to stay wait for my bag of course getting refunds for any of this is probably going to be impossible. Do yourself a favor learn from my mistake and spend more for a better airline

### "don't get how much the quality of service differs"
Not Verified | I just don't get how much the quality of service differs. I flew out to Lisbon on Tuesday and back today. I booked the Aer space seat and was really impressed with the quality of the lovely cabin crew on my flight to Lisbon. They offered me drinks and a snack. Today however was a different story and on my return leg in the same Aer space seat was good except a crew person who was not shall we say as lovely as the former crew. Said person didn’t even offer me the snack and only when I asked if I could have it they said it wasn’t much! So not impressed

### "lack of customer support"
The worst ground service of my life. They took away my carry on guitar. Then, instead of giving it to me at the gate, as they were supposed to do, they lost the guitar by sending it through the conveyor belts when I had to take a connecting flight. Then, they lost both of my suitcases. I have not been able to contact anyone from the airline, even though I have been calling and emailing daily for 4 months. I am tired of dealing with their lack of customer support.

### "I would never use them again"
Not Verified |  Flight was overbooked on first flight and flight delayed one hour with no updates to passengers. Return flight also delayed one hour with no explanation at all. Flight attendants were neither friendly nor helpful. System went down and could not generate boarding passes for 51 flights. This airline is the worst I have ever used in 12 years of international travel. I would never use them again.

### "Worst customer service ever"
Worst customer service ever. My flight from BHX to DUB was cancelled due to system crash on Sept 10, so I also missed my connection back to America. At the airport we were told to leave (after hours of them continuing to add another one-hour delay). There were no Aer Lingus employees at the airport by then (they left when the computers crashed). No help, no hotel voucher, no re-book assist, etc. It was impossible to get through on their phone line. I paid out of pocket for another airline to get me home (someone at the airport said you could book on own and they would reimburse). 2 emails to Aer Lingus for refund and still no reply.

### "Aer Lingus refuses to provide the voucher"
Because of the current horrible airline situation world wide, we cancelled our flight to Ireland, England and Scotland. We didn't want to get stuck because of cancelled flights. I called a month prior to our flight to cancel. I was told I would get a voucher for the value of the tickets good for five years. I understood a refund couldn't be offered because I didn't purchase a refundable ticket. The voucher was fine. The agent checked the timing of the cancellation and said it was well within the period necessary to receive a voucher. I was also told that I would be after my flight was originally schedule before someone could get back to me since they were very busy. I received the following email confirming the refund. Dear Mrs. Ruppert, Our sincere apologies for the delayed response. Your voucher request was approved; however, we do not currently have the ability to redeem vouchers for travel on other airlines, and your original ticket included travel on A A Airlines. As a courtesy, until this is remedied, we will offer a refund. Kindly reply to this email to confirm if you would like to proceed with the refund, thank you. Kind regards, Customer Service Agent. Now Aer Lingus refuses to provide the voucher they promised in the confirmation email. My next vacation will not be to Ireland.

### "Seats are too close together"
Not Verified |  Food is bad, service is no more than they have to do, not very friendly. Seats are too close together, half of the screens don't work. I think it is time to update your aircraft.

### "I'm not using this airline again"
Never again. I fly every week & I'm not using this airline again. My 3.20pm flight has still not left & it is now 5.36pm. The engines have not started up yet & the communications have been appalling on the continued delays all afternoon! I had booked assistance, and stupidly thought, it would not be required as it’s such a short flight. I’m now in agony, very stressed & not so much as an apology from the Airline. I’ll be taking my regular business travel elsewhere.

### "left 9 hours in the airport"
Not Verified | Geneva to Dublin. Airline's IT systems went down and I was left 9 hours in the airport with zero updates from the company or staff. Was eventually accommodated in a 4 star hotel nearby at midnight but extremely poor service and I will be flying with Ryanair in the future. I had to book a flight home the next day for 200euro with another airline but still haven't been compensated for anything.

### "leaving their customers hungry"
The service on my flights from Washington to Dublin, and back to Washington from Dublin, was minimal. There was one full drink service meal at the beginning of both flights, but only a small snack later. There was no second drink service at all on the flight to Dublin, and only a coffee and tea service on the flight to Washington. The lack of a second drink service was especially bad on the flight to Dublin, since there was a long line at Immigration and I couldn't get my morning caffeine fix until after I claimed my bag and was in the public area of the airport. Aer Lingus is a little bit cheaper than other airlines, but it's still not that cheap - for paying more than $600 roundtrip, I expect that they can offer some coffee and tea or another soda before landing. I think Aer Lingus needs to decide if they want to be a low cost carrier where nothing is free but everything is available for a price, or a full service carrier with commensurate service. The middle ground they are occupying now is leaving their customers hungry and under-caffeinated.

### "Aer Lingus has fallen a long long way"
When changing this flight from its original booking I had a problem with the price of the rebooked flight. Their advertising states no change fees. This was not true. I decided to call customer service to resolve the issue. After waiting on hold for 3 hours I gave up and went the chat bot route. Really slow and after 6 hours of basically giving them my details, PNR etc I got a message to call customer service again - after a couple of hours on hold I managed to speak to the agent and explained my issue. He was no help and when I said I wasn’t happy with his answer which was the opposite of their website info, he hung up. On the flight they ran out of meals. When I suggested they get me something from business class the answer was a flat no. I will never use Aer Lingus again for any route out of Dublin where I live and will use alternative airlines. Aer Lingus has fallen a long long way and has all the characteristics of the very worst budget airlines. A real shame for a once great airline!

### "I was denied the full refund"
Scheduled to fly to Rome on September 13, 2022, with my wife in business class. unfortunately, on September 8, 2022, I was diagnosed with COVID. I notified the airline and was told I could either obtain a voucher or get a credit refund. I opted for a credit refund. however, even after submitting a claim with my covid results, I was denied the full refund of $8300. Their reason of course was that i did not cancel prior to the 14 days requirement. Obviously if I knew I would come down with COVID I would have cancelled with the 14day requirement being met. However, I could not have known I would contract covid less than 1 week before the flight. I find the very quick response denying my full refund to be an absolute bureaucratical decision, without any thought process being given to the extreme circumstances. I returned their email asking the person, if they would prefer that I travelled on their aircraft knowing that i had covid. to date I have not had a response. Terrible customer service skills and a terrible decision. They will now refund the $8300 minus 15% admin fees. Guess who will never use Aer Lingus again.

### "short staffed and unwilling to assist me"
I missed my DUB to LAX flight due to the mismanagement and lack of staff at the Aer Lingus ticket counter at the Dublin Airport. I had allowed three hours between my incoming flight from Oslo and outgoing from Dublin. However, we got stuck at the gate for a half hour before ground crew could even wheel a staircase to the airline! After retrieving my suitcase, I headed to the Aer Lingus ticket counter only to discover I couldn't retrieve a boarding pass from the kiosk. I went to the "Ticket Assistance" counter and was told to stand in line with about 120 other people to check in and get a boarding pass. I attempted to check in online but never got through on the website. I was in line for at least an hour. There were only three personnel handling the 100+ passengers who also could not check in. Consequently, by the time I got to the counter and handed over my passport, the assistant actually left the counter for a few minutes! She then told me there was no time for me to catch my 5:15 flight. I went to the "Ticket Assistance" counter again and was told that because I had booked my ticket through Alaska Airlines (which is incorrect), they couldn't help me. Apparently, if you purchase your ticket from any site other than Aer Lingus, you're screwed. When I inquired as to my options, I was told the next flight out would be the next day at the same time and it would cost me $800 (one way). I paid $800 for a round-trip ticket from LAX to DUB and that also meant I had to find a hotel room for the night, which cost me another 239 Euro. All because Aer Lingus was short staffed and unwilling to assist me.

### "there are some frills missing for a business class product"
Not Verified |  Flew business class to JFK and return from Dublin. The seats are comfortable and good for sleeping. The crew are very friendly. The food is good but there are some frills missing for a business class product. The menu is on a flimsy piece of paper, no wine or drinks list is offered, the table is not covered with a linen cloth as on most other airlines, breakfast on the flight from JFK to Dublin is awful, and no choice is offered other than a terrible bacon roll, awful coffee and freezing fruit plate, this needs to be sorted as most passengers don't order dinner, as they wish to sleep so a nicer breakfast would be much better in my opinion. It's a solid product but has room for improvement.

### "my baggage was lost by the airline"
I took off from Paris with a 20 hour layover in Dublin. The flight was delayed for over 2 hours. Upon arrival to Dublin Aer port I went to retrieve my baggage. Unfortunately it was lost. Before I checked this bag in in Paris I had told the check in lady that I do not want to check in my carry on. This was literally a small carry on that had no business being checked in. The lady said that the plane was full and that I should just check it in. This made absolutely no sense to me once I reached the inside of the aircraft which had an insurmountable amount of space for my carry on. Unfortunately I ended up checking in the baggage and once I reached Dublin my baggage was lost by the airline. Now I have no information on the status of my package. Only thing I can do is wait on them to find it and ship it to me. I had very important work related things in that luggage.

### "best airline I’ve flown"
Aer Lingus is the best airline I’ve flown. They have comfortable seats, good food and a wide range of content on their IFE systems. They are responsive, modern and quick. The staff was helpful and friendly. I had one bad experience with a flight attendant who was short and rude with me. That is the only negative thing with Aer Lingus.

### "It was a nightmare"
San Francisco to Paris via Dublin. Do NOT use this airline. It was our first time using them and it will definitely be our last. Both flights to our destination were late, putting us behind by about 2 hours on our arrival to Paris. A little annoying, but fine. However, the trip home was absolutely wretched lol and I cannot emphasize this enough. To start, when we arrived to check in (2 hours before boarding) there was already an announcement stating the flight was delayed by 1 hr. Once boarded we sat for an additional HOUR on the tarmac, causing us to miss our connecting flight home (amazingly the only flight of theirs that left only 15 minutes late). They re-routed us to Seattle, which meant an addition 2.5 hour layover before boarding the connecting flight. There was no offer of food or beverages even though we were missing our in-flight meal service. Once we boarded the connecting flight we AGAIN sat for 1 hour and 45 minutes in the tarmac. No offer of snacks or food. Mind you we are about 4 hours past when we should of had out meal service so we were starving. Thank god our last flight from Seattle to San Fran was with Alaska Airlines as they were great. So to sum things up, we were originally to be home at 3:30 pm on 9/2 but we didn’t arrive until 9/3 at 12 am and of course our baggage was still in Dublin, adding an additional 30 minutes in the airport to submit a claim for the lost bags. It was a nightmare and I will never ever use them again.

### "Only 3 bathrooms worked"
The airline personnel were wonderful; however, the plane was horrid. Only 3 bathrooms worked and two of those ran out of water in flight. Most people had no entertainment because their system was frozen and no WiFi was available. There were no recharging ports on the plane. I was with a tour group, and I will recommend that the group never again uses Aer Lingus! I know I will never make a personal reservation with them!

### "stranded in Europe for another day"
On the way to the UK the flight the TV’s in the headrests were non-functioning. The way back was where the pain comes from however. Got a subtle little text at 4 am (of the morning of my flight that my flight home had been canceled. Their website was non functional and I couldn’t call their customer support because after waiting for an hour on hold they hung up on me. I got to Gatwick airport and there were no Aer Lingus employees. Some poor man from Gatwick was handling an entire flight of people who had been cancelled, not rebooked, and shunned by the company. After calling the customer service again I was able to reach someone who reluctantly helped me change the bookings, however due to their screw up I could not make their connecting flight back to the states. They refused to give me a voucher for another airline and informed me that there was nothing they could do and I would be stranded in Europe for another day at least. When I finally did get to board my flight to Dublin from London they only released the gate location 15 minutes before takeoff. When I arrived at the gate we waited for another 30 minutes as the plane had yet to taxi to the gate. Once finally through the boarding pass check we were herded into the loading area only to have to stand there, cramped like sardines, as they informed us that refueling had to happen and now we must stand in the boarding area.

### "cabin crew were courteous and efficient"
Not Verified |  The flight was on time and arrived ahead of schedule. The cabin crew were courteous and efficient. One piece of my checked in luggage did not arrive and one of the flight attendants personally assisted me in filing a report. Despite all this I was able to board a bus departing 30 minutes after my scheduled arrival time. Thank you Aer Lingus

### "left a very bad taste in my mouth"
Not Verified |  When my wife and I checked into the desk, we were told that they were not able to seat us together. The employee at checking said that he would see what he could do. When we boarded the plane, I asked one of the cabin crew if he could help us get seats together and he assured me that he would try. Needless to say, this did not happen. I was seated beside a lovely woman from Ireland and she felt sorry for me so she switched seats with my wife 5 rows back so that we could seat together. I thanked her profusely for her generous offer. After we took of from Toronto, I became aware of an isle seat (what the Irish lass had given up) was vacant. I had to ask the cabin crew to ask this lovely lass to move to this seat. Why could a big airline such as Aer Lingus be so damn ignorant to their passengers? Having said this, we will neither fly or recommend this airline. It left a very bad taste in my mouth.

### "no flight attendant is going to dictate to me"
I had paid $50 in advance (on top of my airfare) to reserve a window seat in Row 14. I was reassigned to a center aisle seat near the rear of the aircraft with no explanation given. I have contacted the airline but they have refused to refund my money and now I have to go through the authorities. IFE systems did not work properly on the DUB-ORD leg of my flight. No free alcohol was served on either leg. I'm not sure if this is a new policy specific to this airline or if it is industry-wide. The cabin looked reasonably clean, and the food was fairly good but they ran out of my preferred meal choice (chicken) by the time they got to my seat near the rear of the aircraft. The beverage portion sizes were very small: 6 oz. (160 ml). cans of soda. Flight time (wheels up to wheels down) was 7 hours and 51 minutes. Once we reached cruise altitude, flight attendants marched up and down the aisles demanding passengers close their window shades, and then the lights were dimmed to a lavender color. I walked up to the galley and confronted the purser to demand an explanation, and his response was that they did this to allow passengers to sleep. Most people do not ant to sleep on a flight in the early afternoon. What's the point in paying $50 for a window that you don't get to look out of? By the time I landed back home in Chicago at 2:00 in the afternoon, I felt terribly drowsy when I should've been wide awake and readjusting to Central Daylight Time. I can tell you this much: next time I fly, if I'm seated at a window, no flight attendant is going to dictate to me whether the shade is up or down.

### "charged me 100 dollars for a carry on"
When we checked in at Chicago they charged me 100 dollars for a carry on they claim was too big. My daughter had the same carry on, but a solid green. On the return flight out luggage made it to Dublin, but hers did not make it onto the flight to Chicago. It has been over 72 hours and they are still unable to locate her luggage. Aer Lingus has not been helpful in trying to locate her luggage.

### "managed to lose 3 out of 4 of our luggage"
Not Verified |  The plane and airline itself is very average. Decent quality television, meals were alright, however. The part that makes me give this airline below a 1 star is the fact they managed to lose 3 out of 4 of our luggage. As a student, the 2 most important items I lost were my laptop and clothes. It's been 12 days since, and my family has only gotten luggage with mattress linens, nothing important. We filed a claim, and have been ignored completely. Even if we did get reimbursed, there's data on my laptop that simply cannot be retrieved without the hard drive and the data was critical to my work as a student. Today, I found out that there is an entire facebook group called "Aer Lingus Complaints Action Group" with hundreds of people sharing this same experience, noting that Aer Lingus will not do anything unless you file a DOT complaint. They will ignore you, leave you on hold for an hour just to hang up, if you do not file a DOT complaint.

### "I will never get on this airline again"
Not Verified |  Aer Lingus is a partner airline of Alaska Air. I am a million mile frequent flier of Alaska Air and have family in Manchester, UK. This means Seattle and Manchester is a frequent route for me and my family. I agree with other reviews that there are frequent delays - this month 3 hours from starting airport with no explanation or acknowledgement that it has even happened. As we were landing in Dublin we were told that there would be staff to meet us to sort out what to do since we were too late for connections - the last 3 trips this has not been true. There were 14 of us for one connection 2 weeks ago- no one to help, no one to book onto next flight and we were told the connecting flight waited for the first class connecting passengers and then left. The Aer Lingus staff are stone faced and unhelpful when we asked for another flight to get to our destination. We had to collect our bags go all the way out to check in and line up to speak to the single agent for all the Aer Lingus passengers with issues. Again not one acknowledgement of a problem the caused. Most of the passengers had to overnight in Dublin. After 3 return trips I will never get on this airline again nor would I let a family member go through it because it takes travel experience to know what to do to repair the trip.

### "My experience has been disgraceful"
My experience with Aer Lingus has been disgraceful and I would not recommend flying with them. I travelled from Auckland to Belfast to see family with Emirates and my last leg (London to Belfast) was with Aer Lingus. They lost all my check-in luggage for the duration of the trip and I spent much of my two week trip home in call waiting queues, which I was regularly on for over an hour and half at a time, only to be cut off and rushing around buying clothes and other essentials. I have sent emails, filled in their website forms and on my second to last day managed to get through to a person at lost baggage services. I told them so send my bags back to Auckland as I would be leaving the address that they had on file for me in Belfast, so wouldn't be there. They delivered the bags to the address I had already left and managed to ruin that day too. Its been 7 weeks now, I have sent many emails, tried calling loads of times even tried their online chat services and they don't respond - nothing, you are just sent in circles all the while they are taking other peoples money and running a shambles of an airline. I of course understand that bags do get lost from time to time, but the utter contempt you must have for your customers to not even respond to calls or emails for nearly 2 months is totally disgraceful. This company not only ruined a 2 week trip to the other side of the world but they have cost me a small fortune in international call (on hold from NZ for an hour a time) and in purchases replacing items that they lost. The level of incompetence and lack of any care for their customers is breathtaking. I will never fly with these people again.

### "Absolutely disastrous"
Absolutely disastrous. Not expecting much from Economy, but a modicum of service would have been appreciated. Original outbound flight delayed by ~2 hours with no explanation. Lateness required an additional leg (DUB to London, then on to final destination)--arrived many hours late. After paying ~$1000 per ticket RT, I would have thought that a bottle/glass of water might be complimentary, but it costs 2 Euros for intra-Europe legs. I noticed that seating for 3 families (not ours though) was messed up (e.g., mother and 2 kids of ~2 years were assigned separate seats). International flights priced as premium airlines but services are low-cost airline quality. The savings of up to 20% for any Aer Lingus flight is not worth the savings. You have been warned.

### "never recommend this airline"
Absolute worst airline I have ever used. I am a member to the Global Entry Trusted Traveler Program and stunned that Aer Lingus does not participate. To find out why I did not have TSA precheck on my boarding pass I had to wait in the Aer Lingus line for almost 2 hours and then another 90 minutes in the TSA line. Once onboard I never received the special meal I ordered. I was also denied a refill of water. I got off the flight dehydrated and feeling dizzy and weak. The Aer Lingus app is also completely worthless. Would never recommend this airline to anyone. Amazed that Alaska Airlines recognizes such a cut rate, customer unfriendly airline as part of its frequent flyer program.

### "basic competence as an airline"
Not Verified |  The very worst travel experience of our lives. Flight from O'Hare was late to leave, which caused us to miss our also-Aer Lingus connection in Dublin. Flight staff was snippy and unpleasant. When a later-day flight to Amsterdam finally got us there, Aer Lingus had left our luggage in Dublin. This left us trapped at Amsterdam until the day's third flight brought our bag. All in all, what should have been an easy flight with a connection turned I to a 32 hour travel day, most of which spent waiting for Aer Lingus to either show up, find our bag, or otherwise demonstrate basic competence as an airline. Never again.

### "unsure if my kids will sit with me or my husband"
Not Verified |  July 28th, 2022 - secured my seats with Aer Lingus to ensure my daughters (minors) were seated with a parent. Agent provided seat numbers and confirmation. August 10th 2022 - Checked app the day before flight to see no seat numbers. Jumped on a chat with Aer Lingus. They didn't have any information even after I provided the detail and confirmation. They just said go online at 9:25 to book the seats. That didn't confirm my kids were with me. They didn't care at all or take ownership for dropping the ball. Waited on the phone for over an hr to be hung up on by the agent. No one helped. No one cared. No one took ownership despite me being responsible weeks in advance. Still unsure if my kids will sit with me or my husband tomorrow.

### "change the ticket you have to pay the difference"
The ticket is pricing low earlier and goes up significantly over time. It says free of charge to change the ticket but you have to pay the difference which is almost $1000 more when you change your flight on the last days. You end up to pay a higher price for low quality of flight. The baggage was missing and you have to fill out form and pick them up a couple of days later. The return flight was a few hours late and ended up missing the second flight and waiting in the airport 5-6 hours more for the rescheduled flight.

### "impressed with Aer Lingus on this occasion"
EI 722 From Cork to London Heathrow on 8th August 2022 was a showcase of what an airline can do well on a short flight! Check-in online worked a treat and the bag-drop at Cork Airport was made speedy by machines and a very helpful and professional mature lady who went out of her way to help an elderly gentleman and then a family with a disabled child. This staff member is an absolute credit to Aer Lingus. Boarding was orderly and well managed and I noted how the crew were very well turned out and clearly took pride in their work. The female pilot made clear and precise announcements and the cabin crew gave a serious safety announcement and then made sure passengers were compliant with safety measures. During the flight the crew served “to buy” drinks and then duty free items. The flight arrived ahead of schedule and disembarkation was again orderly and well managed by a professional crew who are a credit to Aer Lingus and to their country for that matter. My gripe with this flight was the rather high fee charged for one small bag of 13kg I checked in online. In all other respects I was impressed with Aer Lingus on this occasion. It was nice too to hear Irish used by some of the crew.

### "a rather unpleasant experience"
EI 155 on 5th August 2022 from London Heathrow to Dublin on an A321n. This was by any measure a rather unpleasant experience. The check-in / bag drop was very badly organised indeed. Although I had checked-in online I had to join a mixed queue combining several destinations with this airline. There was one rather rude female employee who bizarrely pushed and I do mean push 6 passengers behind a yellow line. She said that the queue started behind the yellow line the people she pushed included two very frail elderly gentlemen. There was no apology from the staff member and she then allowed a group of teenagers to queue jump! I approached the foreign staff member who did not even have the manners to answer me and she then walked off. Several bag drop machines did not work and so I assisted several elderly people including an non-English speaking couple to use the machines. This was not good enough to state the obvious. I shall add that boarding was not well managed with certain passengers allowed to carry far too much luggage onto the flight. The aircraft was modern with inflight entertainment but the seats were thin and uncomfortable. There was a delay taking off and very poor communication from the crew on a very full flight. Once the flight arrived in Dublin there was no gate available for over 30 minutes the captain did not communicate this well and several Americans were worried about not making their flight on time. Disembarkation was like a rugby scrum. The luggage took a rather long time to come through in Dublin and there was little help at hand for passengers and only a few machines on which to log a complaint! This was a shambles and a poor quality experience for a rather expensive short flight. What a poor impression this creates of this Airline and indeed of Dublin. One has to ask why they cannot employ civil people who speak English clearly rather than surly eastern Europeans with a poor attitude?

### "Absolute shambles from start to finish"
Not Verified |  Absolute shambles from start to finish. Dreadful experience at Manchester Airport. Staff were rude. Check in staff checked all of our bags under one travellers names, which has caused complications. One bag did not arrive at Orlando. Subsequently tried to get help from Aer Lingus, which is non existent. Case reported as missing but no updates provided. Call centre staff don't understand when you phone them. No one replies to e-mails. The plane itself was scruffy.

### "Nobody is there to support"
Not Verified | Frankfurt to Dublin. I lost my luggage, I travelled on July 6th 22. Till now I have not received it. Very bad experience with Aer Lingus. Nobody is there to support.

### "a poorly run budget airline"
I received an email several hours before the flight saying the flight would be delayed an that if I had a connecting flight before a certain time, to call the airline for rescheduling. After 15 minutes on hold I was told to come to the airport and they would assess the situation at that time. Upon arrival at the airport, I was told that there was no way I could make my connecting flight. After considerable research, they told me the best way to get to my Paris that day would be to go to London and take the train to Paris, I would then submit the train and any related expenses for reimbursement, Well I submitted the expenses 7 weeks ago and have not had a formal response, I call customer service repeatedly, usually with 30 minute hold times, and am consistently told to wait as there are a long line of claims ahead of me. I am never given any way to escalate the issue or any idea of when the case will actually be heard. I opened a case with small claims court this week. The issue of the missed connection is understandable. I perhaps should have avoided that, or at least picked one with more room for error. But the problems with customer service, both at the airport and in the claims handling, are unforgiveable. Aer Lingus used to be a premier airline back in the day. Now they are a poorly run budget airline. Avoid at all costs!

### " treated very poorly by the baggage claim staff"
I flew with Aer Lingus with 2 different flights. Both flights were an hour delayed, but that happens. However my baggage was lost on 6/12 going from LHR to DUB (it is now 7/28) and I have still not received it nor heard back from a single employee even though I’ve left many messages. Not only was my luggage lost but I was treated very poorly by the baggage claim staff at the DUB airport. I asked questions on the process of getting my bag back and the employee responded “this is what’s wrong and annoying with Americans, they always want to control things and are always so mad about their missing luggage” Obviously anyone who’s luggage goes missing wants it back? Basically this man brought me to tears and couldn’t care less about how rude he was being and denied my request to personally pick up my luggage, where if he let me, I'd have my luggage by now. It’s been 6.5 weeks.

### "rented a budget airline’s plane"
Not Verified |  Aer Lingus cancelled my original flight on Sunday, which included a layover of 1.75 hours at Dublin from London. They booked us on a replacement flight for 16.40 on July 26. They clearly rented a budget airline’s plane. It’s extremely sub standard compared to the ones normally used for this flight. Obviously need to catch up from stranding customers from Sunday so they’re piling everyone on top of each other. The usual configuration for this flight has 31 inches of legroom. In these seats my 5’9” slim frame barely fits. I did not pay $1,100 per seat (7 of us) for this. Boarding process was another piece of utter chaos. Almost no announcements to tell us they couldn’t work out how to open a couple of doors. I was expecting flight entertainment in the seat back but there isn’t any. No Wi-Fi either.

### "this airline is not worth the frustration"
After having to cancel our trip due to Covid, we are finally going this year. Because I had a voucher from AerLingus I had to call to arrange my flight. It was a nightmare. It took at least 4 phone calls (Avg wait time was 60 min) to finally get it scheduled. On one memorable phone call, after waiting an hour to speak to someone, the Rep hung up on me. Now that the day has arrived, when I try to check-in online (because they didn’t give me a seat assignment), the website said I can’t check in until 7/28 - which is two days after my flight leaves. During an online chat with Support (another 45 min wait), the rep said “that’s when you can check in, sorry for the inconvenience” and the disconnected from the chat. Trust me, this airline is not worth the frustration, pay a little more if you have to, choose another airline

### "no free alcohol on board"
Not Verified |  Probably the worst airline in Europe. JFK to Dublin was uneventful, the food was lackluster but edible, and the IFE worked well. Dublin to Vienna and back was no frills. Dublin to JFK was a nightmare: The flight was 2.5 hours late. The food was disgusting, no free alcohol on board, not even beer/wine. Only 1 six-ounce soda per passenger, no refills, not even water. No TVs on a 7 hour transatlantic flight. The seats were tiny (9 abreast instead of the usual 8), and rock hard. And the broke a wheel off my luggage. I will never fly EI again.

### "flight canceled on short notice"
Not Verified |  Terrible flightS with Aer Lingus. Traveling from Lyon to Dublin : 2 flights canceled on short notice (20h) two days in a row. Coming back to France, flight canceled (on short notice 24h) and postponed 2 days later. I had paid for direct flights but was forced to do a layover in Nantes. Not a big deal for me, but arriving in Nantes from Dublin on my way back home, Aer Lingus had not purchased the 2nd ticket. I had to call them (in Ireland) to make them buy the ticket. I made a complaint on their website, to receive a compensation for the 2 hotel nights I had to pay + food. They said I'd get an answer within 14 business days. 30 days later I'm still waiting. Called the Customer Service, and they laughed at me for expecting quick answers!

### "One of the very best transatlantic experiences"
Not Verified |  One of the very best transatlantic experiences I have had in many years of travel. The staff, on the ground and in the air, were pleasant, efficient and courteous. We were met at Dublin airport after the overnight flight, escorted to our new gate, and politely told when we needed to return to board our connection (ninety minutes). We were also told where we could find a bureau de change. The clincher was that about three hours into the Toronto to Dublin leg, the young couple just ahead of us had to deal with a new and very upset baby; nothing seemed to work. Along came a senior lady staff member who took up the baby (obviously much experienced!) and within a minute the baby was quiet (and reluctant to be given back). In May 2023 we shall take Aer Lingus again to Dublin and back from Gatwick, with much pleasure. It is our Number One airline for Europe.

### "I'll stick to Ryanair in future"
Not Verified |  2 months ago we decided to go to Lanzarote and we decided to pay extra to choose Aer Lingus and also extra for the early flight, got an email 24 hours ago saying the flight is rescheduled by 7 hours and just 10 minutes ago another e-mail saying Privilege airlines are taking over our flight. Obviously decided to read reviews online and they're shocking. They have 4 aging airplanes to boot too. I'll stick to Ryanair in future.

### "I will be looking to fly another airline next time"
Not Verified |  Although the plane is comfortable, the staff are very attentive and friendly and the meals are good, they lost my luggage on my connecting flight in Chicago. Getting a hold of their customer service is impossible. I filed my missing/lost luggage but was unable to track it online because I didn't have a reference number that the website would accept. I called all the listed phone numbers and they would continually hang up on me over and over. I used Facebook IM per their way of "contacting" them and I was either ignored or just told that they would get me to the correct person to help over and over, which felt like a run-around. I prefer this airline to the others because my first experience with them was very good but since then, they have cancelled my flight and left me to sleep in the airport on the way to Ireland then lost my luggage on the way back. I will be looking to fly another airline next time.

### "Cabin crew were friendly and efficient"
Not Verified |  When BA cancelled our BA flight we opted to take up their offer to pay a little more and transfer to an Aer Lingus flight that was much more convenient than the alternate BA flight that was offered. This was organised on the BA website, which gave us no information about the baggage limits on the Aer Lingus flight. The Aer Lingus website didn't recognise our BA booking reference, so no information could be obtained there either. When finally we were able to check in 24 hrs before the flight, it appeared that our BA 23 kgs allowance had been reduced to 10 kg. It took 30 mins on the phone to Aer Lingus to establish that our baggage allowance had only been reduced to 20 kgs. BA and Aer Lingus should have a better interface, as they are both part of the IAG group and sell each other's tickets. The flight itself was comfortable and on time, although the boarding process was very slow due to a faulty scanner. Cabin crew were friendly and efficient. Aer Lingus' policy on cabin baggage was effective in reducing congestion during the boarding process, and was fairer on people bring a reasonable amount of cabin baggage.

### "A disgrace to Ireland and the aviation industry"
The EI should stand for eternally inferior to most other airlines. Horrible food, only 1 drinks service for a transatlantic flight, getting a whole can of soda was like pulling teeth, then the FAs disappeared for the rest of the flight. European flight was no frills, LCC. A disgrace to Ireland and the aviation industry.

### "frustrated by this airline"
Not Verified |  I am frustrated by this airline. They have lost my bag in a direct 1 hour flight. It was scanned in the airport and since then, missing. I've not heard back from them unless I push them aggressively to call my from live chat, and even after that I hear the same status. I have tried everything, calling, filling forms, nothing has worked. Horrible customer service and horrible airline I've ever experienced. My bag had all my essentials and it was a relatively new bag itself. They are doing nothing to help me. I feel defeated.

### "our luggage is missing"
Not Verified |  I hate that I must write a negative review because there are many things I liked about the flight. However, they flew our plane from Paris with almost no luggage loaded, on a full flight, and two weeks later the airline has yet to contact us to even show that they are aware that our luggage is missing or that they know that they need to be looking for it. The system for processing claims has completely broken down and the airline should be ashamed of this lack of competence. I understand that here are problems with volume and strikes involved, but after 2 weeks, all that we have received from the airline is an automated message that someone will process our request within the next 14 days.

### "no way to check in electronically"
First there is no way to check in electronically before arrival at the airport. And there was no way to contact the airline as we tried to find out if there was a luggage weight limit. And because we were booked on Aer Lingus, we could not check in electronically for the 2 united flights to follow. Second, we arrived 3 hours early for our flight, 5:30 am, but check in desk does not open until 6:30. So I could have slept another hour. Third and the most important we were given wrong information. The lady at the check in desk at Aer Lingus said she could only give us the boarding pass for the flight on Aer Lingus from Glasgow to Dublin. All of our flights were booked through United, United is the one that put us on Aer Lingus. She said she could not issue our boarding passes for the connecting flights from Dublin to Chicago and Chicago to LA. She told us we would have to go through the "transfer center" in Dublin. When we got to Dublin, there was an area for people to scan their boarding passes and continue on. We only had our passes from Glasgow to Dublin, so when we scanned the pass in Dublin, it rejected it and would not let us pass through. The people working there (Dublin airport employees) told us we would have to go through customs, downstairs and go to United check in desk, When we got through Irish customs and to the United desk, the lady said our flight was closed. She worked on her computer to get us on and we were given our boarding passes for Dublin to Chicago, and Chicago to LA. Her co-worker told us we might not make it to the gate on time. But then we had to clear Irish customs and security again, and then we had to go to USA pre clearance- security and customs again with long lines for all of these. I was very upset and anxious the longer it took, it seemed like one line or queue after another. I was picked out for advanced screening which took even more extra time. Our layover in Dublin was only 2 hours and we almost missed our flight. We were finally cleared and ended up running across Dublin airport to our gate. I was anxious, upset, tired, in physical pain and it caused stress between my husband and I. By the time I boarded the plane, I felt ill. (I am disabled) It all could have been avoided if we could have gotten our boarding passes either at the Aer Lingus check in gate or she could have told us to go to United at that time or allowed to check in electronically ahead of time, but United and Aer Lingus don't talk to each other.

### "zero customer service"
Brussels to Toronto via Dublin. By far the worst company I have ever experienced. There is zero customer service. Not only they lost our luggage but it seems like they are not even dealing with the issue. We tried to reach out to the company (and the airports) by phone and by email dozens of times every single day for the last 7 days but no one is even answering. This company seems to have a massive operation issues with a lack of staff. Such a company shouldn't even be allowed to operate. If you think that Ryanair is the worst Irish company, trust me: you're wrong.

### "They did not offer to help in any way"
My flight to Dublin had some issues with connecting partners. It took 35 minutes to get an agent on the phone to correct my connecting flight. My flight home I wanted to change. For some reason the only option online was to cancel. I didn’t want to cancel just to make some changes. I have since been on hold three times totalling 9 hours. So I went to Dublin to make the change in person. After a 2 hour wait I was told the change could only be made online or by calling. They did not offer to help in any way. I was literally crying and they didn’t care at all. So I called again. Now the simple change is $1,200. But I only learned that after another 2 hour call. How does an international company not let desk agents assist all customers? And what is the executive team doing to assist the call centre. I have wasted three mornings, one evening, and one night of my trip just trying to change a flight.

### "Very positive experience"
Milan - Los Angeles via Dublin. Very positive experience, fair rate, smooth boarding, good service on board. The preclearance check at Dublin airport for US immigration is quite useful, when you arrive in the US you are considered as a domestic traveller. Just pick up your luggage and go. I really would recommend Aer Lingus.

### "there is no important communication"
First and only time I will ever take this airline. While the staff are friendly, there is no important communication. Both flights were delayed with no explanation. We can’t use online check in for no reason at all. The seats will require you to make expensive chiropractic visits. Our seats didn’t recline. The head rest made my neck not be aligned with my head and shoulders. Plus it was freezing, like shivering, even with a blanket. Our connecting flight did not post the gate it was leaving from, we had to run through the airport, not just jog, but flat out run for a mile even though the flight attendant told us it was a small airport and we’d be fine. Our flight changed at the last minute with no warning at all. Then we sat on the plane after running a marathon, just sitting around, no explanation. Warning seriously. I’ve flown a lot. It’s not worth saving a bit of cash for this.

### "supportive and human attitude"
Very good flight attendants, cheerful and understanding young passengers (under 3 years old) needs. Very supportive in terms of helping to get to and from aircraft without buggy left at the entrance of airplanes area (as new rules stipulate). Essential team for helping me, a single parent, travelling with a wobbler, a toddler, and back-bags. My words cannot say enough about your supportive and human attitude. A big thank you!

### "neither respect or care for customers"
Not Verified |  I am sitting at home writing this review. I should have landed in Barcelona 30 minutes ago. I perfectly understand that operational matters can ground aircraft which according to Aer Lingus was the case with EI564 on the 25th June. However the manner with which a cancellation took place showed neither respect or care for customers. Notification of the cancellation arrived on my cellphone 3 hours and 30 minutes from departure. This did not allow me time to make any alternative arrangement. If you are dropping a bag arrive 3.5 hours before departure. Informing me on the way to a chaotic airport in free fall did not allow for this. The lack of joined up thinking is disgraceful. The alternative given to me was a pitiful attempt to retrieve a bad situation Aer Lingus offered this rerouting alternative. Dublin to LHR 1400 on the 26th June. An onward connection on the 27th june LHR to BCN with BA at 6AM. Make your own arrangements in London.

### "such a small cramped plane"
Flight EI 127 on 11 June 2022: Ridiculously small aircraft for such a long journey, it was cramped and pokey, unfriendly staff and no bar service offered. Going to the loo was a real joy & we were told not to when the food service trolley was on its way. Flight EI 126 on 20/21 June 2022: same problems except the staff were much better, friendlier & more helpful. Why such a small cramped plane for a transatlantic journey? I regularly travel to Spain on Ryanair on a similar sized aircraft but that's only a 3-3.5 hour journey. Unless Aer Lingus up their game, I certainly will not be using them again for long haul flights.

### "they are wholly unreliable"
Aer Lingus have friendly, professional staff on board, the planes are modern. Those are the two positives I can take. But they are wholly unreliable. I could give several examples that highlight this but my trip in May 2022 is ongoing (it's now June 24th): they lost my bag for 48 hours. Eventually it was delivered, but, aside from ruining my limited time in Manhattan the number I was given to call at the airport simply didn't work. No emails were ever received (which they assured me would be sent). My $354 of expenses have never been reimbursed, worse, I have wasted hours sending emails (the form generally says 'something went wrong' after 30 minutes of inputting receipts and bank details) - but even if accepted no-one responds. The telephone for baggage simply goes to a recorded message, I have called a half dozen times no-one has ever called back.

### "Service was abysmal"
No sense of urgency at any stage! Plane was delayed however, no apologies or update on departure time. Service was abysmal. Crew more interested in chatting than serving customers. Service did not start until 1 hour after take off, on a 1.5 hour flight that is useless. Not a Ryanair fan in general, but at least the get these things right most of the time!

### "gave us only two seats together"
Our problem began when they cancelled our flight, we spent hours upon hours on the phone trying to get new flights but they transferred us time after time and we were on hold for hours at a time. When they fixed our flights they said they couldn’t give us seats together but to talk to them when we check in and they promised it would be resolved. We were with 2 children (one only 7 and the other 11), and one child with epilepsy. When we checked in they gave us only two seats together and the others scattered across the plane. We explained that we at least needed three sets of 2 seats together since we were traveling with children and a persons with a neurological disorder. Again, they were rude unhelpful and passed it along again and told us to talk to the gate attendant before boarding and they again promised it would be sorted. The third woman was the rudest I’ve ever experienced, she finally told us we could ask the people on the plane. Luckily two people were willing to switch.

### "unfriendly and rude service"
It started already from the time we checked in, they checked in the wrong persons and gave us boarding passes for persons who did not fly with us. My son and my daughter did not travel with us and instead of matching our passports with the reservations they just printed out the boarding passes randomly checking in my son and my daughter instead of myself and my friend. When I realized their error, the luggage was already on its way to the airplane with tags attached matching my son and my daughters' boarding passes. The lady at the desk was not able to change the error and had to call another flight attendant to fix the boarding passes but instead of checking my son/daughter out again they checked us in additionally without matching the luggage tags/tickets to our names/boarding passes. Long story short the luggage was unloaded since my daughter/son did not travel with us. During the flight the flight attendant forgot our row to pass out drinks and when I asked her politely if I was able to get a drink, she was angry and extremely rude telling me to get back to my seat and wait my turn. She then ran after me yelling to give her the seat number which made me lose my desire to get something to drink. However, I had a terrible headache, the flight was 10 hours long and I did need some water which I eventual got. She did apologize blaming her Irish accent for the misunderstanding however I have Irish friends and I know the difference between simply being rude or just having a charming accent. We also never got any blankets on the flight, and I was afraid to ask since I knew it would trigger another rude reply from her. Needless to say, we all will avoid this airline in the future. It started with pure incompetence and ended with an unfriendly and rude service.

### "took no ownership of their mistake"
Absolutely terrible, we missed our flight and they didn’t make accommodations. Missed our connecting fly due to our Aer Lingus flight being delayed. Got to Boston spoke with a representative and basically said “sorry there’s nothing we can do” and sent us on our merry way. Absolutely took no ownership of their mistake. Screwed up and just let it screwed up. Will never fly them again. Rate 0 out of 10.

### "I will never fly with them again"
This was an absolute disaster. They lost my luggage and said they would contact me, but they didn't. I had to contact them and they told me the bag was on the way to Dublin, so I went to the airport to collect the baggage. On the spot, I had to wait 4,5 hours until someone helped me, there was a huge shortage of staff and no one could help me. In the end, it turned out that the bag wasn't even there and that I had wasted my time. They told me that "the fact that the bag has been loaded onto the plane doesn't mean that it will arrive". A week later they finally called me to say that my bag would arrive in Berlin on the next day. To my question if they would deliver the bag to my address, the least they could do to compensate for this nightmare, they said it depended on how much work there would be at the airport in Berlin. A week has passed since then and no one called me, emailed me and no one's picking up the phone. I still haven't received my bag. This airline is a nightmare, I will never fly with them again.

### "made our experience an absolute nightmare"
I am a mother traveling alone with my infant son, and Aer Lingus has made our experience an absolute nightmare. I called to request a bassinet seat for my baby to be able to sleep on the 7 hour flight from Chicago to Dublin (8 hours on the way back), and I was told to contact Special Assistance through their website, which I did. I was then told via email that I was assigned row 30 on flight EI122, and was told this was a bassinet row. When I boarded the plane (which was two hours delayed), I arrived at my seat, baby in my arms, to discover that row 30 is a bulkhead row but nota bassinet row. The only bassinet row on the aircraft I was on is row 9. The flight attendants told me not much could be done, but finally we begged to switch with someone in row 9 and someone was kind enough to do it. However, I had to move back before landing so that the original passenger in row 9 could alight the plane first, so had to lug myself, my infant son, and all our stuff back and forth three separate times. While onboard my flight to Chicago, I discovered eventually that my seat's media system was broken, the remote for it did not work, so that even though the screen seemed to be fine, I could not control anything/make anything play on it. This meant I could not watch anything, could not listen to anything, could not even call the flight attendant, turn on my own light. When I was finally able to alert a flight attendant and let them know, they brushed me off and said they would make a note of it, offering nothing else to help or compensate. I had no media available to me after I was able to get my baby to sleep in the bassinet they provided, which, by the way, is a beat up cardboard box lined with airline pillows, and airline blanket, and strapped in with straps that go above the baby's feet and right above the baby's head. Far from a nice set up. On the day before my original flight back from Dublin to Chicago, I tested positive for Covid 19. While I've been asymptomatic, I understand that the US requires negative tests to re-enter the country, and while it was an unfortunate situation, I anticipated being able to handle it. I did not  anticipate that Aer Lingus would have no policy for dealing with this kind of a situation. I once again waited on hold with them for over an hour to be told that in a situation like this, all they can offer is for you to change your flight for a large sum of money (over 450 euro in my case). They offer no flexibility which is impossible for a situation like this one. I can't imagine I am the only one (I'm probably one of hundreds if not thousands) who is having to reschedule their flight because they will not be let into the country due to unexpected test results. But Aer Lingus offer no sort of flight credit or flexibility, even though I have no way of knowing when I will test negative and be let back into the US. It could be in two days time, it could be in twenty days time, and Aer Lingus only seeks to make you change your flight over and over again, charging you more and more money each time, even though this is something completely out of the passenger's control. I finally booked a flight seven days away, and just hoped and prayed I would be negative by then, also knowing I would miss a good amount of work and income by being out of the country

### "The flight was comfortable"
After the total shambles in Manchester Airport, we were able to board our flight almost 45 minutes after the scheduled departure time. The staff were welcoming and we were seated with a revised gate departure of 54 minutes delay. The flight was comfortable with a pleasant and professional attitude from the cabin crew. The food was as acceptable as most airlines provide. Nothing spectacular but, considering the ticket price, was fine. Alcohol had to be purchased but a low cost airline doing so is no surprise. We arrived into MCO two minutes late. Good flight overall and I felt satisfied that our return to the UK would be no different than this outbound leg.

### "a terrible experience"
The cabin crew were atrocious on our flight back from Dublin to JFK. They were, inattentive, rude and disrespectful. As we were taking off in the late afternoon, I decided to catch some sleep after takeoff. I was jostled awake by a flight attendant as my seat’s position was reclined too far for dinner services to be served. This attendant’s words were, “I’m going to need you to return your seat to its standard position for inflight meal service.” There was no, excuse me. To make matters worse, neither me nor my partner were offered meals. They forgot of our existence. All in all it was just a terrible experience.

### "They served terrible food"
They served terrible food from Dublin to Toronto, and from Berlin to Dublin, they didn't even provide a bottle of water, and if you wanted anything, you had to pay. They broke my luggage. I claimed at the airport but they refused without any apologising.

### "total nightmare working with them"
Not Verified |  The crew was great. Working with the company was a total nightmare. Two of my older daughters tested positive for Covid at the airport. Aer lingus employees refused to even help them. By the time they finally could get in touch with an Aer Lingus employee, they basically said tough luck. Said that they had missed the refund window by 5 minutes. So they ended up booking flights on a US airlines several days later for a lot of money. The rest of us tried to book flights on Aer Lingus several days later when we would test negative. One of our travel companions spent 3 hours on the phone just to get the flight changed for several hundreds of dollars. It has been a total nightmare working with them. That is if you can even get in touch with them. And don’t even get me started about the check in at the Dublin airport. It was horrible.

### "will avoid in the future whenever possible"
First time with Aer Lingus, will avoid in the future whenever possible. No words can explain just how terrible, lacklustre, unprofessional and disinterested the on-board service was despite the flight being not so full. The cabin crew were frowning the whole duration of the flight, no smile, no nothing, very snappy and looking like they didn't want to be there. It took them 2hrs 30mins and 5 requests for me to get a glass of water. The crew at the back galley refused to help and asked me to ‘ask the forward galley, as it’s their shift’. Even Europe’s most hated low-cost airline has a more decent service than Aer Lingus. 4-Star Airline? How much are you paying for that label? You’re not even worthy for a 3-star label with that kind of service. My wife’s dietary restriction request was not entertained despite having requested it online way in advance. 4 out of 5 drinks I asked (that were listed in the on-board menu) were not available. My food was bland. Seat was okay, my table tray kept coming loose. Some parts of my seat were dirty. IFE: the screen is small, and the unnecessary onboard notification after any announcement (after the pause when it’s made) is annoying. The flight departed 40 mins late but caught up and arrived on time.

### "Horrific check-in experience"
Horrific check-in experience. I have always known Aer Lingus is not the best, but they were, at least, funny and polite in the past. Business-class ticket, priority check-in desks - there was something that I assumed is an issue with their App and thus I was waiting in line vs using the baggage drop-off (which was faster in economy). First I realized that the new so-called Platinum Service by DAA, is utilizing the Business Class check in desks, then I realized there are only 2 of them available, after probably an hour of waiting I got to the check-in desk and was told I need to fill out another form (which I had already done, and I was able to provide with veriFly another app, however, the lady kept on telling me I need to show email verification. I gave her all my information and never got email verification. IMHO she was doing this so the DAA stewards of the Platinum offering can keep on using the check-in, or she was misinformed/ trained on the virtual check-in process.

### "A disappointing trip"
A disappointing trip. The good points are that the flight was on time and the ground service was good. However the food was atrocious. They started serving from the front and back but mysteriously stopped serving from the back after four rows. A pasta meal was thrust at me and when I asked if there was an alternative was available I was curtly told that they couldn't plan for everybody. The pasta was almost inedible. There was very little drinks service. This was a single aisle plane with only two toilets at the back which meant the aisle was often crowded and could explain why the drinks service was poor. I would question the wisdom of this type of plane on this route.

### "Horrible service"
Not Verified |  Horrible service. I have a severe gluten allergy, I wasn’t accommodated for even after sending in my allergy weeks prior. The woman who first helped me was amazing. She got me fruits and snacks as an accommodation but during breakfast, the other attendant threw down a breakfast sandwich on my table. When I told her I have an allergy, she questioned me about if I had told the airline, I told her I did, she took the sandwich and said “I guess you’re only getting tea then”. Then for our connecting flight to Scotland today, we were left in the cold for over an hour, got on a rickety plane, and then were forced to return to Dublin due to technical issues. I’m currently still in Dublin, I haven’t eaten properly in two days, I haven’t slept, and I’m not in the right country.

### "overall a good option I find"
Not Verified |  Speedy boarding, friendly staff and cabin crew. They offer a good price alternative to Ryanair and the experience overall is much nicer. It's overall a good option I find when flying out of Ireland.

### "horrendous service"
Dublin to London. The staff at the front desk was incredibly rude after I left my bag at the baggage claim area. They told me it would be several hours before someone could retrieve my bag and the woman had an extremely unfriendly and nasty tone. She told me I would not be able to speak to a manager because everyone was “too busy” -  horrendous service I will never fly with them again.

### "This is not service at all"
Check in at Gatwick was slow (average 15 mins per passenger - there is a clock; at least one had to wait 25 minutes and a family had to queue 3 times to get check in) that although I was issued boarding passes and went directly to security the machine refused me entry because the flight was closed. The check in staff were a sub-contractor and there was no Aer Lingus representative at the airport. Calls to Aer Lingus took at least 30 mins wait and several attempts. I was charged a $200 change fee and had to spend GBP28 to bus to Heathrow. Now my calls for recompense do not go through, nor does online chat get any response despite being online for several hours. This is not service at all. It is effectively a shut out.

### "don't care about its customers"
Aer Lingus lost my baggage on March 26th. The lost baggage was located the same day (March 26th) in Paris. For 14 days Aer Lingus has been unable to simply put that bag in a plane and have it flown to Toronto. After about 20 phone calls and 3 emails Aer Lingus stills says to be apologetic about my situation but the tone of voice of every single baggage claim representative says different. Aer Lingus doesn't offer a phone number to escalate claims nor give the option to email anybody. At this point i am willing to even email the CEO of he company but Aer Lingus is careful not to provide that information. Aer Lingus is a company that simply don't care about its customers and will treat with utmost disregard to every single customer asking for their assistance.

### "A321Neo is not a transatlantic plane"
The A321Neo is not a transatlantic plane. One aisle with bathrooms at the back causes major traffic jams between cabin crew and passengers trying to get to the bathrooms. Overhead luggage is very limited. Will never fly this plane again transatlantic. This is a shorthaul plane and should never be flown to destinations over 2 hours.

### "One of the worst airlines"
One of the worst airlines I've experienced. First, the customer service does not exist, I've tried to call for four days, waiting for over three hours before giving up, so I had to drive to the airport to ask a few simple questions! Chat was not available. Then on our flight back from Dublin, instead of extra leg room sits in the first row, 8a and 8c, that I paid separately over $400, we were assigned a second row, 9a and 9c and when before boarding I asked why, they told me that it's ok and I'm still on the first row because the layout of the plane was reconfigured. When we boarded the plane, they just said sorry and offer to move us to even worst seats, next to 3 month old baby. The final insult was when the guy came to us and offer some left over wine from the business class 30 minutes before landing. In my list of the worst airlines, Aer Lingus has the solid second place (after Spirit of course...)

### Aer Lingus customer review
Incompetent and exhausted airport staff took 60 minutes to process a paid upgrade just to make a mistake and put me on the wrong flight. A totally thoughtless airport design, pathetic business class Aer Lingus lounge with piled up dirty dishes and no food, closed Fast Track, and careless attitude permeate this third-rate airline. Never again!

### "terrible customer service"
London Heathrow to Dublin. Aer Lingus is the flag carrier of Ireland. God help Ireland! I sent an email over a week ago with my Etihad booking reference, asking 2 simple questions and still no response from Aer Lingus. Q1. What is my carry on baggage allowance (I'm flying via a partner airline) and Dublin to London is my final leg with Aer Lingus? Q2. What do I have to do when transferring from a partner airline arriving at Terminal 1, then departing from Terminal 2? Do I need to collect my checked-in baggage at Terminal 1 and then recheck in for the Dublin to London flight? Simple questions. No response. What terrible customer service.

### "this airline is preying on people"
Not Verified |  Flew from United States to Dublin fine. Their customer service is the worst, usually 60+ minute wait each time you call, sometimes they pick up and disconnect right away, start process all over again. If you're lucky they pick up in 40 minutes. My wife and I booked business class seats for our flight back. While in Ireland we contracted Covid three days before our departure. Immediately called the airline to explain the situation how we couldn't leave on our original date, we simply wanted to change our departure date to a later date. After again a 60 min. wait on hold for customer service we were told that not only did we have to pay $500 each ticket to move our departure date, our business class seats were not refundable, transferable, or eligible for voucher. Thousands of dollars straight to Aer Lingus without them showing any empathy, courtesy, or willing to help in anyway. Simply "its our policy" and if I wanted to speak to a supervisor one could get back to me "within 72 hours". During a global pandemic this airline is preying on people with no regard for their customers, just are completely fine stealing their money. So sick in another country, spending money on extended hotel stay, and losing thousands of dollars to Aer Lingus and they simply did nothing, nor cared. Dealing with this airline or worse than having Covid itself.

### "Rude staff, very hit and miss"
Rude staff, very hit and miss - sometimes nice sometimes so abrupt and unhelpful. They changed our aircraft type after we paid extra for business seats, no notification and no refund - Nothing! They’re 3 star at best on Atlantic service and 2.5 in Europe.

### "I was denied boarding the flight"
On my flight today from Washington DC to Brussels, I was denied boarding the flight. Despite just a connection flight and less than a 2-hour layover in Dublin, they wanted me to have an Irish Transit Visa. I am a permanent resident of the United States and have a valid Schengen visa. Since I have an Afghan passport, so had to obtain a transit visa. While I was booking my tickets, I provided all my documents and details (passport, green card info, and visa) to the airline. They send me the link to Verifly to submit all the required documents for my trip, they never informed me about any transit visa requirement. The Aer Lingus representatives on the counter were rude and even didn't care to even provide any information. This caused me a considerable financial loss. I have continuously tried to connect to their customer service line, but couldn't succeed in being on hold for more than an hour. I will never book any tickets with this airline and would never recommend them to anyone.

### "customer service is appalling"
Not Verified |  I booked to go in to Seattle and out of San Diego business class in June 2022. They sent a simple email saying the Dublin Seattle leg was cancelled. Then begins a bizarre sequence of attempts to try and work out exactly what I was going to do. Is the San Diego Manchester leg still active? Do I get a reasonable refund? Try and call, no business priority line despite paying for business, just a line with no indication of how long you will be on hold at 9p a minute. They recommend you use messenger. They answer once a day. How can I have a sensible conversation like that to resolve my concerns. I also travelled to Chicago from Manchester. There was no business class Manchester to Dublin so you are treated as an economy passenger. All fine once you get to Dublin but is poor before that. Overall there is no way to get hold of a person and have a sensible conversation, if it works it’s fine but if it goes wrong customer service is appalling.

### "Would recommend"
Not Verified |  Very quiet flight with only 5 passengers in Business Class. Service from staff was great with lots of attention re drinks and a nice meal. Would recommend.

### "ground staff are not very knowledgeable"
I booked my flight to Calgary (Aer Lingus EI105 - 11:35AM + WestJet WS1681 via JFK New York) with Trip.com. I checked the COVID test requirements for Canada (my final destination) in the days leading to my flight and read that I needed to have a negative PCR done within 72 hours of flying. This I did 2 days pre-flight. When I arrived at the airport at 8:00AM, the Aer Lingus check in staff queried my COVID certificate, but I told her that my final destination was Canada, not US, and I was told that my COVID certificate was then "fine". My baggage was checked in, I got through security, US customs and border protection, and all the way I proceeded to the boarding gate. When I approached the boarding gate staff at 10:40AM, I was asked to fill out a form for US clearance stating that I had a negative test within the last 24 hours. I couldn’t sign this and told the ground attendant that my final destination was Canada. He told me to wait aside. After all the other passengers have been boarded, he told me that I could not board the flight to New York since I didn’t have a negative test taken within the previous 24 hours. At that stage, it was then too late for me to get an antigen test. The other ground attendant told me the luggage would be off-loaded and I will have to collect them in carousel 6. He tried to rebook my flight, but since I had booked with Trip.com, he said I should contact the travel agency as he couldn’t change it. I was escorted to the exit leading to baggage reclaim and told “You know if you hadn’t said anything, we would have never noticed it. That’s what you get for being so honest.” I contacted Trip.com and the rep said she will forward an urgent flight change request to Aer Lingus. I then got an email stating “the airline said that according to the policy they cannot operate the change. Your ticket is non-changeable after departure, it is all up to the airline company.” At that stage, my options being extremely limited, I rebooked my flights to Calgary at a cost of 644 euro plus I had to get another PCR test for 69 euro. I managed to fly next day but to add insult to injury, all the luggage that I paid for went missing and did not arrive with me. If I had been told at check-in on my original flight that my COVID cert was invalid for the US, and if my luggage had not been checked through, I would have had time to get a negative antigen test, I wouldn’t have been denied boarding and wouldn’t have incurred the extra expense (644 euro flight + 69 euro PCT test). I have written to Aer Lingus and they initially "offered" to refund the flight. However, that also seemed to be the end of the conversation from them. I submitted multiple follow-up requests using their case update portal but haven't received a single response since then. Trip.com will refund me but they cannot proceed as Aer Lingus has not refunded them yet. What happened to me was an avoidable mistake by the ground attendants at the airport. Aer Lingus' ground staff are not very knowledgeable, are complacent, and don't have a sense of accountability with regards to the current guidelines on COVID testing and travel requirements for passengers.

### "enjoyed my flight with Aer Lingus"
I really enjoyed my flight with Aer Lingus. The ground crew at Orlando were rude, however they weren't Aer Lingus employees, but this did slightly impact the experience. The on board crew were lovely, and were chatty and making sure we were ok. The food was very tasty and plentiful. My biggest complaint comes down to the IFE - there was a disappointing amount of TV shows and Movies, and the map was an old school one that you couldn't move yourself. This wouldn't stop me flying with them again, however. The value for money was there.

### "The Verifly app will not work"
The hassle if you don't have Verifly at the boarding process is nonsense. Verifly wouldn't accept my vaccination certificate or recovery certificate, or my partner's picture. We get greeted at the boarding gate by a woman shouting 'Verifly boarding only' over and over at us. We had priority boarding - that counted for nothing. The queue was chaos with people unable to understand what was going on, or people scrambling to do the Verifly process thinking they wouldn't be allowed to board without it. The Verifly app will not work with an Irish/EU recovery certificate, and given the number of recent cases that renders it useless. Staff on board were great, but this was so much more hassle than Ryanair, Air France or KLM have been recently.

### "unable to allocate seats on the JetBlue flight"
Not Verified | Beware  using Aer Lingus connections with JetBlue. They are unable to allocate seats on the JetBlue flight. This resulted in my wife and I being allocated middle row seats 12 rows apart on the jetblue flight. Aer Lingus business class mediocre at best in comparison to rival airlines. Very poor food and cheap poor wine selection. Cabin crew the only redeeming element of the modern Aer Lingus.

### "Absolutely horrible experience"
Absolutely a trash experience coming from Dublin to Chicago. We ended up waiting on the plane for other passengers to board when it was way past our expected take-off time by over an hour. We were not compensated for this lost hour in any way at all. People who can’t show up on time need to be left behind in order to keep the responsible people on schedule. Absolutely horrible experience and I’ll always be telling people about it and how awful it was. My time is valuable and I didn’t appreciate how inconsiderate Aer Lingus was regarding it.

### "they don't really seem to care"
I wanted to go to Ireland to shoot woodcocks. I brought my shotgun with all the related paper work: European firearm pass and Irish certificate. It was all validated at Paris CDG by the Aer Lingus team. And then they simply forgot to put my shotgun in the plane to Dublin. And even worse, they seem to have lost it. It has been more than 10 days now and they cannot find my shotgun. And the worst is they don't really seem to care. Their call centre has a terrible connexion, and the operators keep on saying they are sorry but they are unable to locate the firearm which is under their responsibility. I will never ever fly Aer Lingus again.

### "could only refer me to do another test"
Came to Chicago O'Hare with a negative PCR test to fly back home to the Netherlands and declined, apparently University of Chicago is not acceptable? They could only refer me to do another test at the airport (20 minutes away) for  240 dollars! In the end we agreed on a rescheduled flight for September, but up till today I am still waiting for my new ticket. Luckily the KLM check-in desk was next to Aer lingus so I was still able to fly a day later without any problems. Many emails have been send in which a generic response and as of today I have finally received an email.

### "I can now no longer take one of the flights"
I booked my flights home for Christmas four months in advance to minimise the costs. Aer Lingus have informed me that they have taken the liberty of changing the times of both flights by more than 12 hours. I can now no longer take one of the flights, as I had booked for 10pm because I have a job, and they moved the flight to 9am the same day. There were multiple other flights the same day they could have moved it to, that were closer in time to the original flight. Because of their seemingly random choice, my options were either rebooking onto another flight and paying the difference (around £300) or cancelling the original flight and rebooking onto another airline (£230). Surely if you cancel the original booking, the passenger should either have a choice of when to rebook, or you should move them to the nearest flight.

### "rather uncomfortable and disappointing flight"
Short hop across the Atlantic. But rather uncomfortable and disappointing flight. Cabin crew were not groomed particularly well and this set the tone of their service. They gave an impression of not wanting to be there or perhaps even tired. Food service was fine and speedy drinks bar service with reasonable prices. I don’t use IFE. But a cramped single aisle plane with only two toilets is not suitable to be honest. People sleeping with legs in the aisle made going to the bathroom at the back an epic journey. I think IE could do a little bit better particularly with its crew, grooming, and set the tone a bit better. Not a cheap one way ticket either.

### "not fly with this airline ever again"
Not Verified |  This company has offered daily tickets to different destinations all over Europe at affordable prices during, and after, the COVID 19 pandemic restrictions. Their strategy was to cancel those flights right before the 14 days period that the EU 261/2001 law stipulates. They would, after, offer you 3 options: full refund, Flight reallocation or voucher from company. I chose to get a full refund and, well, turns out that Aer Lingus Customer Services are one of the worst I have dealt with. I created an application form for the total refund of my flight tickets, which was never replied to. I have tried to call them several times with no answer. I have written several emails with no reply. And after all, they kept sending me emails re allocating my flight (the one that suppose to be cancelled for at least 14 days). Nowadays I am still trying to get to them, but no response. This seems to be the way they have been operating lately. I will not fly with this airline ever again.

### "they were selling tickets on a flight that they had already cancelled"
Not Verified |  Last March I booked above flights to Dublin and then received an email to inform me that the flight was cancelled due to Covid. Further informed that no refund was available but a voucher would be issued in next 6-9 months. I then booked a second flight the following week to same destination and again, received an email shortly thereafter informing that this flight was also cancelled due to Covid. And again the same process of no refund, voucher months later applied. It smelt like a scam to me so I retried to book my original flight - dates, times etc.. and would you believe, the original flight that Aer Lingus had cancelled on me was still available to be booked on their website. So they were selling tickets on a flight that they had already cancelled. Only recently I did receive a refund of approximately half what I paid for the flights. They said it was fees that made up the difference. What a disgrace of an airline. Never again Aer Lingus.

### "not credited to the original voucher"
Not Verified |  While I have no problem with the fights themselves, I have a big problem with the way they have been dealing with the vouchers which they issued in lieu of cancelled flights. Our flights to and from Munich in March 2020 were cancelled because of Covid and I was given a voucher number immediately but I didn't get a pin code for the voucher until December 14th 2020 and in the meantime I had to pay for Aer Lingus flights in July 2020 because I didn't have access to the voucher. This year we again had flights to and from Munich and I did finally get to use the voucher, the outgoing flight was cancelled but the cost of this flight was not credited to the original voucher, so it seems that we've lost this money. Just yesterday I tried to add a 20Kg, bag for our return flight using the voucher and while it took the cost of this from the voucher it didn't book the bag, and I've spent 40 minutes waiting to talk to customer services, without success. The system is a complete and utter shambles.

### "staff on both flights were incredible"
Not Verified |  My son and I flew from Chicago to Dublin, Ireland on June 23rd returned Dublin Chicago July 23rd. We flew to see a sick parent and their flights were reasonable. I wish Aer Lingus flew from Atlanta (we had to fly from Atlanta to Chicago) to Dublin - they are incredible! The flight going to Dublin was so comfortable and the food was lovely but the staff on both flights were also incredible. The staff couldn’t do enough to make the trip great! The captains and assistants flew us safely and checked in during the flight. Also want to mention Dublin Airport for friendly staff and especially Martina from Duty Free - she was incredibly helpful. Security was thorough and friendly also. Keep up the great work Aer Lingus!

### "Six weeks later and no refund"
They offered a steal of a deal during the pandemic. I knew I was gambling on most of the ticket fee, since it wasn't refundable, and I ended up having to cancel because hotels weren't open in Dublin at the time. They still owed me the $80 refund of the government fee. Aer Lingus claimed they had 'unprecedented volumes' and were overwhelmed. If they had half a brain they'd know that by offering all these flash sales during a pandemic they'd need to be able to handle cancellations and rebookings. I emailed them 3 times, no response. Six weeks later and no refund. Needless to say, I'll never give them any more of my money.

### "Impossible to contact Aer Lingus"
Not Verified |  The flight was cancelled by Aer Lingus. Based on the Aer Lingus policy I am entitled to get a refund. Waiting for weeks now. No reaction at all. Apart from e-mails from "no reply" mail box. Impossible to contact Aer Lingus by phone (over 45 minutes waiting time).

### "I have yet to see my voucher"
They cancelled a flight, I requested a voucher in Oct. 2020, and it is May 2021 and I am still waiting. I contacted them per email, and on Twitter, and I have yet to see my voucher. They have promised to issue it several times, but they just want to keep customers' money. So I am back to travelling with Ryanair, because although their service could improve a lot, at least they are honest and upfront about every single expense.

### "not care about their customers"
Not Verified |  I was flying from Edinburgh to Dublin to Boston in 2020. The weather was bad, so after two scary attempts to land us in Boston, they landed us in a small airport in Hartford, CT instead. This is fine-being safe. Once there, they sent a representative to talk to us. They were going to bus us to Boston, MA, which would mean my connecting flight to Raleigh would be missed (I had booked this separately). I spoke to their representative numerous times. (Oh and they had lost one piece of my luggage too, which they were able to find a few days later). The plan from Aer Lingus was to bus us to Boston and we would arrive between 1 and 2 in the morning. We were told that the airport would then be closed, but we might be able to get a cab to a nearby hotel, but they were not sure if any were running. Their plan was to dump us outside of Boston Airport at 1 or 2 in the morning. Remember, this is after 2 extremely turbulent attempted landings and a diversion to a different airport. I asked if they could put us up in the Hartford Airport hotel instead. I was told yes and that I would be reimbursed, but the fastest way was to pay it myself and ask for reimbursement later. I also asked about having to rebook my connecting flight that was missed, and was told yes, it would be reimbursed. I was lucky enough to have enough to pay for an unexpected hotel and extra flight, but not everyone may have been so lucky. I filed a request for a reimbursement through Aer Lingus website as told to do. It took over a month for a response and was told that they could not help me because I showed them bank statements and no the original receipts. I got the original receipts and sent them in. I was denied at that point because "there responsibility was to get me to Boston, not to pay for connecting flights or hotels. So-even though I was told directly by their representative that I would be reimbursed, and that their plan was to drop us off at a wintry cold airport at 1 or 2 in the morning with no accommodations, they feel they held up their end of the deal. Ridiculous experience. They do not care about their customers. Pilot and flight attendants were great people though. Sorry the company is under par.

### "refuses to refund me"
I had booked a flight with aer Lingus but then the travel ban came into place around Christmas time and I couldn’t travel. Aer Lingus refuses to refund me and when I’ve queried this, I get emails about how I agreed to the terms and conditions. Absolutely no help or hope of getting my money back even though there was a government travel ban. Ryanair  gave me a full refund for my flight going the opposite end way but Aer Lingus have left me high and dry and made it very clear that they don’t care about me or my custom. I don’t intend to fly with aer Lingus again

### "You have lost a customer"
Booked Q4 2019 for flight in August 2020, Covid struck and Aer Lingus pushed people to take a Credit Voucher with time limits that were not fair. Credit Voucher took so long to arrive (Jan 2021) and customer services stalled with will expedite, in final processing for months and months. Eventually I gave up and contacted my Credit Card company and requested a 'Charge Back'. Luckily you have 120 days after the flight was meant to have occurred. I ended up getting a 100% Refund thanks to my Credit Card company. Be warned Aer Lingus - You have lost a customer for how you handled me and this event.

### "Airline not willing to extend credit"
They just got away with my $897 without offering an option of alternative. I booked a ticket SEA-MPX-SEA in February 2020, with outbound date June 2020. Due to COVID I cancelled they trip and got, through Expedia, a credit. Credit will expire tomorrow. Airline is forcing to book between January and February (2021) since credit from original ticket was purchased on February 2020. However, no flights are available in between both months. Airline not willing to extend credit to purchase tickets beyond February 2021. Also, not willing to move expiration date of credit from 31/12/2020 (tomorrow).

### "6 months waiting for vouchers"
6 months waiting for vouchers. Rang them multiple times but they keep telling me it's not their department. They won't put me through to the correct dept. or give me contact details for them. Just keep putting me off.

### "went far beyond the call of duty"
Not Verified |  My husband took a turn and was poorly he couldn't get onto the aircraft by himself the cabin crew organised help who where absolutely amazing they also organised help when we arrived at East Midlands. The staff and cabin crew went far beyond the call of duty and exceeded our expectation. I cannot thank them enough. When I asked for help they wanted to ensure we were well looked after and we were 110%. The ground staff and cabin were the best I have ever experienced.

### "Aer Lingus is basically getting away with theft"
Not Verified |  Like many other complaints here - Aer Lingus is basically getting away with theft - for myself - I requested a voucher almost 9 months ago in Mar 2020 and nothing. Pretty sad and sickening to see them using COVID-19 as an excuse to keep people's hard earned cash. There are quite a few complaints where we are talking thousands of dollars/pounds/euros. I have also been reading from other complaints - that even when people get the voucher after waiting many months that the voucher is being denied.

### "I have never been so appalled or angry in my entire life"
Not Verified |  Absolutely disgusted! Booked a few days away in Edinburgh a few months back as a birthday present for my partner. Had rang around 2 weeks before my flight date to cancel as both Belfast and Edinburgh had went into a further lockdown. The advisor told me even though I couldn't get a refund as the flight hadn't officially been cancelled, that he could move the flights to the same dates next year due to "exceptional circumstances" free of charge. He then advised me to wait until 24 hours before my flight to do this as there was a chance I could get my money back in the event that the flight was cancelled. This was not the case however and when I rang to get the dates changed I was told by another advisor that there would be an additional charge of £168.00 on top of the £150.00 I had already paid. When I disputed this and told him about the previous conversation he became quite blunt and rude and told me to wait until 2 hours before my 7am flight to see if they were going to cancel it if I wanted my refund? Not usually one to write reviews at all, but I have never been so appalled or angry in my entire life, I think in the middle of a global pandemic, where people are struggling enough as it is, for an airline to blatantly rob people is beyond a joke! Basically, the fact that there's a lockdown means nothing when it comes to travelling, even though some people can not afford to take a further 2 weeks isolation period off work. I have handed Aer Lingus £150.00 of my money for nothing and have been refused a refund even due to the circumstances or even the basic courtesy of a flight change 1 year in advance. I have never heard of anything this disgraceful happening with an airline and I certainly will not be travelling the thieves again, and will be advising others not to either.

### "This issue made me feel really uncomfortable"
I had a flight from Edinburgh to Belfast this evening (Oct 26th, 2020), I wore a pair of gloves since I have a skin issue, too much hand sanitizer directly to my skin will cause bad eczema. However, before I got off the plane, a crew member at the gate suddenly spoke to me: “just a suggestion, you don’t need to wear gloves just washing your hands more frequently will be fine!” This made me feel offended and been judged by her, first of all she doesn’t know the reason behind, secondly I’m not here to seek her opinion, she really should keep her very personal opinion to herself! This issue made me feel really uncomfortable!

### "My flight was cancelled"
My flight was cancelled for some reason; the airline didn’t even had the courtesy or system in place to notify the customers. I came to know when I tried to go through airport security as they couldn’t locate the flight. The airline company sent no email, text message or updated the information online so that customers are aware. I was put on a flight 25 hours later. I missed my work and had to figure out my myself the place to stay in the interim. I had to pay out of my pocket for the stay. When I called customer service they refused to help. The online customer service refused to help or compensate for cancellation as well. Now I wonder why would anyone with sane mind ever use such irresponsible airline company.

### "Customer service has been absolutely appalling"
Not Verified |  After months of sending emails and requests I finally received an Aer Lingus voucher for a flight cancelled in May. It now transpires that I cannot even use this voucher to pay for an outstanding balance on changing flight dates with Aer Lingus. Customer service has been absolutely appalling throughout.

### "flight could have been much better"
Not Verified | The cabin crew were polite although not so attentive. Before takeoff, they went through the safety procedure talk although it wasn’t very clear and from where I was sitting I couldn’t really see what they were demonstrating. Some other passenger was wearing headphones while takeoff and was sleeping. They were told to take them out but as they were sleeping they didn’t hear and the crew member didn’t even look to see if they did it. A bumpy landing in Dusseldorf. I love the livery but this flight could have been much better. Also, the drinks service was too late and I didn’t have time to finish my drink.

### "no in-flight service whatsoever"
Not Verified | We flew from Belfast to Edinburgh and return on Aer Lingus Regional, operated by Stobart Air. On the plus side both flights were both on time. On the negative side the fares were expensive compared to a competitor or the route, although we liked the convenience of flying from Belfast City so were prepared to pay a premium. Also, we had paid for a checked bag as our cabin sized bag was too large for Aer Lingus Regional’s tiny cabin baggage allowance. However, when boarding many other passengers were allowed to bring on all sorts of larger cabin luggage on board with nothing said by the ground staff or cabin crew. The cabin crew, while polite, just went through the motions, there was no in-flight service whatsoever which was disappointing as there was nothing open in the airport prior to boarding. The crew blamed Covid-19 regulations, but other airlines are managing to offer a service.

### "a splendid representative"
Not Verified | A big shout out to Margaret who was working on the Aer Lingus ticket desk on friday last 28th August. You dealt with my sister Debrah who was flying to Boston that day. We had a race against time to get extra paperwork. The code of conduct, customer service, empathy, understanding and compassion were second to none. I always knew Aer Lingus  were known to treat their customers with care and thats exactly what you did, you proved that right. Aer Lingus this lady is a splendid representative of your company and she should win employee of the year.

### "haven't tried to get in touch or respond"
Not Verified | Booked flights from Birmingham to Dublin, Aer Lingus rescheduled the flights from Heathrow instead, a month on and they haven't tried to get in touch or respond to my request for refund. They're coasting along on government grants and ignoring their customers completely. Disgusting.

### "a mediocre airline"
Not Verified | Aer Lingus is a mediocre airline. The economy class seats are old and could use some refurbishments on the A330. Also, the seat is tight and there is very little room to have a good sleep. The food was  mediocre. The IFE had a decent selection of American content with the majority being Irish shows. The in-seat universal power had hard time holding an iPhone charger. This issue was brought to the cabin crew by many passengers but the only response I got was that the old A330s had so much wear and tear that the outlets didn't work.

### "the person hung up on me"
Not Verified |  I applied for a voucher because my flight was cancelled due to corona-virus, I received an email to say they had received my voucher request on 23/03/20. I have made two phone calls to Aer lingus the first one said they would escalate my request. In my second call they said they had no record of my earlier (two weeks previous) escalation. I was given an escalation number and I asked if nearly four months of waiting is long enough, the person hung up on me after getting through and her putting me on hold took about forty five minutes.

### "I can not wait to move my money elsewhere"
Not Verified |  So so bad. Customer service is so poor it feels an intentional act to make you give up. You get through to a call centre somewhere in the Americas where the line is so faint and scratchy that communication is hard, compounded by staff who do not speak English as their first language and mistakes are made frequently. Their website is almost not worth having or using as it's so unstable, unreliable and random that you can not trust it at all. I've even tried contacting their head office but they just ignore you. I've only used Aer Lingus out of necessity in lock down and I will move my weekly commutes back to Easyjet or anyone else as soon as possible - I can not wait to move my money elsewhere.

### "Waiting for voucher refund"
Waiting since 24th March for voucher refund, after a lot off emails they said it was emailed to me approx end off May but I never received the voucher. Since then no response to my emails and customer service is a disgrace. My rating is based on customer service only.

### "trying to get upgrade fee returned"
I was forced to cancel my trip to Dublin due to the coronavirus. The Aer Lingus system would not allow me to cancel my reservation online. Because I had bid on an upgrade that had not yet been processed I wanted to make sure to cancel before that bid processed. after many hours over several days trying to get through to their reservations department I was charged the upgrade fee. To cancel my flight I resorted to an email. I have spent the last several months trying to get the upgrade fee returned to no avail. I would not recommend this airline. Their actions during a global pandemic indicate they care about nothing but making money.

### "would have preferred a refund"
I booked my flights through Aer Lingus and put in the bids for upgrades. The first flight out was on 12th  march and the upgrade bid was accepted and paid for. Unfortunately within a few days of travel the holiday was cancelled and we were advised to return home. Aer Lingus offered free change of flight but price difference would apply. The change function on the website and app were not working. I received a message telling me to contact direct by phone. I was surprised by this in such an age of automation, and a little disappointed. But I was given no other option by Aer Lingus. I called as advised and was on hold for a full 2 hours, I then spoke to an agent who advised my change of flights would be €435 as this represented the fare difference. I accepted and was asked to wait so he could set up payment, then he hung up without taking payment. I was not called or contacted by this agent despite him confirming my phone and email details. So I called again, and again on hold, this went on for 90 minutes when again, having not spoken to an agent, the line was hung up. I called again and after 1 hour the same occurred. That now made it close to 5 hours and no change of flights possible, the frustration at this lack of basic functionality in such a company I found staggering. With the global situation going from bad to worse and the fear of being trapped in the states with no medical insurance and all the other problems a lock down or illness would bring, we had no choice but to book completely different flights to get us home. Again we went with Aer Lingus and this cost us €1577.76. Although I was glad I could get us home, and in the knowledge that I did not have to use Aer Lingus again, despite being so frustrated at the lack of service, I did. But would have been a lot happier if the same ease to book new flights could have been matched by the process for changing existing flights. I received a mail 18th of March to say that I could cancel my flights for the 23rd and would receive a credit in the way of a flight credit plus 10%, again I would have preferred a refund but, was happy to cancel the flight and take the credit to be used later. Then I received a mail to say that my upgrade for my cancelled flight home had been approved and a further €980 had been debited to my card. I now make that a total of €2,5557.76 that I have paid Aer Lingus for flights I should have been able to change for €435. A staggering €2,122.76 cost difference because Aer lingus could not provide basic functionality to change a flight during an emergency. since then I have sent a number of emails looking for clarification and have been replied to by different people each time. the latest tells me that no vouchers apply for flights before the 21st of March. my flight was on the 23rd and I have provided all the documentation they have asked for on this. In my latest call to them, after a further long wait, I was told that this would have to be dealt with by a manager and I was promised a call within 48 hours, this has not happened. I know they are hoping that I get tired of this and just walk away, but I won't.

### "Horrible customer service"
I had a flight leaving March 15th 2020. My flight left at 930pm. A travel ban went into effect at Midnight that same day, 2.5 hours after my flight was to leave. My tour was cancelled, hotels closed, and I could not travel, or I would of been quarantined either in Ireland upon arrival or United States upon returning. With no tour we had to cancel flight. I was in a group that was to appear in the St. Patricks day parade in Dublin, which was also cancelled due to Covid-19. Aer Lingus wanted us to rebook our flight, and fly there by the end of the year 2020. We have no vacation time left. The tour company in Ireland refunded our fare. Aer Lingus wont, saying they will only refund our taxes. Horrible customer service. Unrealistic expectations to fly there this year with the virus spreading globally, including Ireland. All essential travel is on hold. How can anyone even realistically plan a  trip like that at this time.

### "displeased with customer service"
Not Verified |  I am thoroughly displeased with customer service. I filed for a full refund in March when the travel bans were established. If I did not get a full refund, I intended to take the voucher. However, Aer Lingus only refunded my taxes and fees without notifying me. They still have yet to notify me that they closed my case. I called back as soon as I noticed the partial amount in my account. The first representative was very helpful and offered to send an email requesting a full refund since I was not told my options. However, when I didn't hear back, I called again. The next representative was very rude. She kept interrupting me and told me it would be denied and that I was at fault. She said my case was closed and they are not returning my money even though the flight is cancel. My main issue is my account was closed without my consent and without being told my options. I would have never taken the taxes and fees over a full price voucher. Now I am being shut down because they closed my case. They also will not send me any documentation to send to my trip insurance. I still have not received an email telling me my account is closed and why I was only refunded taxes and fees. Now they have profited over $800 from me on a service they are no longer providing over a technicality and loop hole of a situation.

### "Irresponsible airline"
Not Verified | Dublin to Chicago. Irresponsible airline! My wife and I had a “bucket list” vacation planned to Ireland including a return flight from Dublin to Chicago on Aer Lingus. Unfortunately the coronavirus pandemic rose and we decided to do the the responsible action and cancelled our trip . Another airline we were taking and all of our hotels were very cooperative and totally refunded our reservations. Not so with Aer Lingus as they refused to refund our money. Very disappointing from an industry that provides the vehicle for such a pandemic to occurr in the first place . I feel we were penalized for making a responsible decision to cancel

### "not possible to get any response via email or phone"
Not Verified |  London to Dublin with Aer Lingus. Not the worst airline I have ever used, but the one that I would least recommend. Even though I should have been able to rebook my flight to a day later, it was simply not possible to get any response via email or phone. in the end, I was forced to the flight I didn't want to take. PS: I did get a response to my emails. Stunning three weeks later.

### "Shame on this airline"
Not Verified | Prague to Dublin. Shocking behaving during coronavirus crisis. Despite coronavirus shutting down my country/borders I cancelled all my flights with Aer Lingus and they refund only 10 % of the price. Shame on this airline for not helping people during a global crisis and national emergency.

### "would not refund our booking"
Not Verified |  Shannon to Edinburgh. Terrible customer service. Despite Coronavirus shutting down our country / borders and cancelling all events Aer Lingus would not refund our booking. Shocking and appalling. Shame on this airline for not helping people during a global crisis and national emergency. Will never fly Aer Lingus ever again.

### "crew were so pleasant"
Not Verified | Dublin to Chicago. Aer Lingus was very understanding and flexible during the coronavirus pandemic. We needed to change our flight once the UK and Ireland ban went into effect. They were helpful and quick with the change, at no extra fees. The flight attendants and crew were so pleasant and happy to help during our flight which helped ease our stress levels. I would recommend Aer Lingus and continue to fly with them in the future.

### "I want an immediate refund"
We are due to fly from Dublin in April to Izmir. Aer Lingus are offering a reschedule to an unknown date in the future and waving the admin fee or a voucher. I want an immediate refund.

### "refused to refund or exchange"
Chicago  to Dublin. Due to the pandemic I decided not to fly to Dublin tomorrow as planned. Aer Lingus refused to refund or exchange my ticket. I understood that was the case when the ticket was purchased last November, but under the circumstances I would think the airline would work with us. However, they refused to do anything and said it was our choice not to go on the trip. Why would we travel when everyone is advising against it. I'm very sad to cancel my trip but Aer Lingus is making it worse by not refunding our money. I was told if my ticket was purchased after March 6 I could get a refund. Who buys an international ticket that close to a trip date? My flight is scheduled for March 15. I will never recommend this airline to anyone.

### "imposed a 100$ fee to change flight"
Not Verified |  The response from this airline to the Coronavirus is highly unethical. I had a flight to Dublin, yet the government of Ireland announced the country was going to be on lock down due to the virus . I was not willing to get stuck there nor risk my health, yet the airline imposed a 100$ fee to change flight and the change difference ranged from 300-800 for different dates. They are offering no options to customers other than forfeiting all amount of the trip, knowing there is an epidemic. Most of the other airlines at least have offered to cancel fees for changing dates. This is the worst airline and obviously have no human values within their company.

### "they offered no flexibility"
The response to the COVID-19 situation by Aer Lingus has been lackluster to say the least. Aer Lingus has literally not a single mention of "COVID" or "coronavirus" across their website, even as they have shut down all flights to and from Italy. Also, despite the "Avoid Travel" warnings from the US CDC and State Dept, they offered no flexibility in terms of changing my existing flight to Rome, but once I was here, they axed all flights to and from Italy. After they had cancelled my flight, I called them, and found they were unable to accommodate me in a flight from Geneva, which they serve, and is the nearest location they serve that's accessible by train. Also my understanding is they would have charged me any fare difference for such a flight. RyanAir saved me in this situation with a direct flight to Dublin, and honestly they are leagues beyond Aer Lingus in terms of response to the COVID situation. The Aer Lingus cabin crew are excellent however, shame the leadership at Aer Lingus has done such a bad job planning and responding to the COVID situation.

### "most airlines are allowing changes"
Toronto to Dublin. It is astounding that Aer Lingus is not allowing people who have existing bookings (ours is for tomorrow - Mar. 11) to change them without the per person / per direction change fee, which is not cheap. They have announced that new bookings can be changed with no fee, but are not making this policy change retroactive. I'm not even asking for a refund - a credit for 12 months would be acceptable. I live in Canada and have always flown Air Canada internationally, but decided to give the flag airline for the Republic of Ireland a try this time for our first trip to Ireland. Friends of ours have gotten credit from Air Canada, so I guess I have learned my lesson. My understanding is that most airlines are allowing changes with no change fees. We are so disappointed to have to cancel our trip to Ireland - our daughter was in tears. We feel very badly for the small businesses in Ireland, like B&Bs and hotels, but they were all willing to give us a refund, even when rules should have prevented it, but not Aer Lingus. If Aer Lingus won't offer flexibility, we won't be using Aer Lingus in the future, and I will actively recommend to anyone who will listen that they shouldn't either.

### "would not waive their change fee"
Not Verified |  Boston to Dublin. We had to cancel our flight due to the virus outbreak and they would not waive their change fee of $600 to change our flights to the Summer, they will waive all change fees for new customers only, clearly sending the message that they do not care about their current customers while whey are trying to entice new business. It is times like this that a company shows its real corporate morals and what they really think about their customers. This is not how one builds customer loyalty. We will never book with them again.

### "Disappointed with their unsympathetic response"
Not Verified |  Very dissatisfied with Aer Lingus’s customer service and policy concerning flight change charges due to corona virus. Disappointed with their unsympathetic response, especially since other airlines are waiving change fees due to this crisis. Am of course willing to pay the additional charge for a summer flight, but at this point, will never use Aer Lingus again and advise family and friends to look elsewhere. Not customer friendly.

### "great flight with Aer Lingus"
Dublin to Los Angeles. Had a great flight with Aer Lingus. Comfy seat with plenty of leg room, and even better having a row to myself. Food was ok, edible. IFE was average with an okay choice of TV/ movies however the touch screen was really responsive. I must give a special shout out to Rachel (cabin crew) on my EI145 flight on Feb 21st who went above and beyond taking care of me. I advised I was slightly nervous flying and she did all that she can to make me feel comfortable. Had really great chats also and she always had a smile on her face when walking through the cabin. I would definitely fly Aer Lingus again and would recommend their transatlantic service. Pre clearing US customs in Dublin Airport is also the best thing ever.

### "last experience with this airline"
Arrived in Dublin for return flight to Amsterdam. We had no issues with the inbound flight. Ticket counter insisted that we pay for baggage when it was included in the price of the ticket and we weren't charged inbound. After calling for assistance it was straightened out but with an attitude. They treated us as if we were trying to scam them . The flight was canceled due to weather in Amsterdam. We were offered to fly to Brussels in 3 hours and take a bus to Amsterdam. They assured us aer lingus staff would assist in Brussels. We flew to Brussels. Nobody works there from aer lingus. No staff to assist. By the time slow baggage was received the bus left . We were directed to the swissport counter and were given a taxi voucher to Amsterdam for the 2 hour drive. When I asked where the aer lingus staff were who were promised to assist they laughed and said there is no staff they just say that. Weather happens. You can give timely gate announcements and rebooking without an attitude that it is the passenger's fault. You cannot assume every passenger is lying about baggage and then have an attitude when wrong. I believe this will be the last experience with this airline.

### "Pleasant experience"
Dublin to Rome-Fiumicino. Pleasant experience. Checkin was seamless and well organised and as we were a group of 20 they took our bags free-of-charge which made travelling through the airport an easier experience. However, boarding was quite a long drawn out process. Long walk, then lift/stairs to an eventual bus. Checkin is through Terminal 2 but you end up getting bused to a mini satellite terminal (South gates) where gate 335 is located before actually boarding the plane from the tarmac. Infrastructurally, this issue lies with DUB airport as opposed to AL itself. Onboard the staff were very friendly, courteous and operated efficiently. The first 45 minutes of the flight including takeoff were quite shaky and turbulent but cockpit provided plenty of info en route. Very nice flight, staff exellent but disembarking took some time as all passengers had to get off via front of the aircraft even when stairs were provided at the rear. Overall, I’d recommend Aer Lingus but a little more attention to the details: boarding and disembarking required.

### "Overall I enjoyed my trip"
Not Verified |  Manchester to JFK via Dublin. Overall I enjoyed my trip to New York with Aer Lingus. The cabin crew were very polite and the airline  held the plane because our Manchester to Dublin flight was delayed. Aer Lingus let themselves down when they out us on a late flight to Dublin, this left us with a half an hour gap until the plane to JFK departed. This meant we were rushing through American customs and we only just made it. It would have been better if we were out on an earlier flight so this could have been avoided. The inflight entertainment was not the best with only a few films which directed to my age range. The food was quite nice and was served about 2 hours into the flight.

### "Excellent customer service"
Dublin to Chicago. Excellent customer service today from Leah on the Premium check-in desk. Her infectious good humour set us all up for a great start to our US holiday.

### "I did not receive a wheelchair"
London City to Philadelphia via Dublin. I had to take an emergency flight back to the states because my father passed away suddenly. I searched on skyscanner and Aer Lingus was the cheapest so I booked it. I am a disabled passenger so requested wheelchair service, as I cant walk or stand for very long. I did not however receive a wheelchair at any point of the journey. And I wasn't pointed in the right direction to get one. I flew out of London city which is a small airport so I was able to make it through security and to the gate. When I got to Dublin I waited for everyone to leave from the plane before I did, as it's easier and less of a pain standing and waiting behind people. There was quite a long walk to get down the plane steps and into the baggage area to then find my way to my connecting flight. I noticed on the baggage belt there was a suitcase similar to mine, it was in fact my suitcase! They were supposed to have transferred it onto my next flight to Philadelphia. Luckily I had seen this because who knows if it would have made it there. Anyway after trying to find someone to take my luggage I noticed a desk and I explained the situation and said they'd personally make sure it made it onto my next flight Between my connecting flight I had to go through security again, which annoyed me. At security I hadn't put the tray on the belt straight so staff called me back to do it. It was very condescending, when she could have easily done it herself. Once on the plane, it was very spacious as I was lucky enough to have both seats next to me empty, which made the trip very pleasant. My flight home was easier than the trip I had there. I would like to warn people not to purchase the wifi. I have never had an issue purchasing wifi on a flight before but to spend £6/€6 on what I thought would last longer than a couple minutes, I think is disgusting (They confirmed it lasted 4.4mins) I have disputed this and they refuse to refund or do anything about my complaint. Also they ran out of the choice of food on the plane, con of sitting towards the back end of the plane I suppose, but I don't think this should happen. Landing in dublin, it was early hours of the morning I again struggled to get to my next gate. I walked for what seemed like miles without having the wheelchair assistance I had requested at the beginning of my booking. I finally made it to my gate after several rest breaks, and had a smooth ride back to London.

### "experience was quite pleasant"
Amsterdam to San Francisco via Dublin. I booked the airline on Skyscanner because it was $300 cheaper than others I found and was puzzled as to why it didn't show up on other sites like Travelocity. Afterwards, I checked reviews online and began getting worried as the common theme seemed to be that staff was horrible, planes were cramped, and they lose luggage often. With those images in my head I went to the airport in Amsterdam hoping for the best but expecting the worst. The staff at the counter was pleasant and although there are no boarding groups everyone got on the plane free from incident. The plane wasn't any more cramped than other budget airlines. After US preclearance in Dublin, I boarded a larger plane from there to San Francisco. The plane was about half full which gave us our pick of open seats and the flight attendants were surprisingly pleasant. In fact, one gave me an extra meal saying I "looked like a growing lad". Unfortunately, the food was terrible. I only had carry on baggage which was not scrutinized for its size. All that said,Aer Lingus like most other businesses gets reviewed based on whether the customer is lucky enough to get a happy crew or a grumpy one. My experience was quite pleasant and based on that I would recommend the airline.

### "disorganization in Frankfurt"
I was flying from Frankfurt to Boston via Dublin. At the counter in Frankfurt I and about 20 other passengers were told by Aer Lingus staff that they would not check us in because Aer Lingus flights that day from Dublin into the US were cancelled. They did not give an explanation as to why although later I was told that it was 'operational problems'. We were sent to a separate desk with generic airport booking employees unrelated to Aer Lingus for rebooking. These airport people had to call the regular Aer Lingus hotlines in order to be able to rebook anyone, but these hotlines were busy for more than an hour, and the Aer Lingus people in those call center were only allowed to process 3 rebookings in a single call, drawing this whole process out unnecessarily. During this time the flight to Dublin had departed and the original Aer Lingus front desk people had disappeared. It took 3 hours until my rebooking was looked into, at which time most alternative transatlantic flight options for that day were gone. So were all the options with any of their partner airlines with which they allow free rebookings (of which there are few in the first place). So I was told to take a hotel and wait for a flight the next day. I instead had to book a flight for the same day via British Airways via London on my own and had to pay over 2000EUR for that. Most of that money I now have as a loss, but at least according to EU regulation Aer Lingus owes me a compensation of 600EUR which would at least pay for a part of it. In phone calls and mail communication they have now started to claim that the flight had not been cancelled it had only been delayed and they don't owe me compensation. I checked the flight history on Flightaware and saw that EI0139 on 1/7 did indeed fly. The reason for this mess up I can't fathom. In any way, since they barred me from the flight, they owe me 600EUR regardless if the flight in the end would have been possible or not. While I'll eventually get the 600EUR, the time and money wasted so far both with the situation during the trip and dealing with them in the aftermath is enormous. And greatest is the disappointment with Aer Lingus. I have flow with them a couple of times and from those experiences had thought them to be a half way solid airline. But the level of disorganization that they have shown that morning in Frankfurt dwarfs anything I have ever seen before.

### "highly recommend this airline"
Not Verified |  Lisbon to Seattle via Dublin. It was my first time with Aer Lingus, and everything went great! It is a long route to accomplish, and all flights were on time which is crucial. Also, their mobile App has a very good user interface, flight staff is very friendly (which is expected, coming from Irish people). The plane was well maintained and clean, it was not a new plane but that’s normal. The food was not so much to my taste, but not bad. Personally food is the least important aspect of a flight .. so overall I highly recommend this airline. I’m sure I’ll fly with them every chance I can!

### "service was flawless"
Paris to Chicago via Dublin. First time traveling with Aer Lingus. I really enjoyed my flight specially on the way back because of the leg room I had. First the price was unbeatable and they let me chose my seat when I bought my tickets. From the check in at the airport to the flight attendants service was flawless.

### "Had a good flight"
Had a good flight from Dublin to Amsterdam and great staff on board the plane. The cost of hold luggage with Aer Lingus is robbery as far as I am concerned. I was then travelling onward to Izmir and my flight to Izmir included seat choice, 30 kg hold luggage and food. It was far cheaper than the Aer Lingus flight from Dublin to Amsterdam. I had to use Aer Lingus is I had no other choice and that's the only time I use them.

### "Excellent business class"
Glasgow to Toronto via Dublin. Weekend in Toronto for a bit of work and a birthday party, husband and I would normally fly Transat Club or Icelandair Saga. Also frequent BA Buusiness customers. After flying with Aer Lingus, we will never fly with the other carriers again if we can avoid it. From business check-in, to streamlined security and clean, well-serviced lounges - even the pairing with KLM in Toronto was excellent. Polite, well-mannered cabin crew - who could not do more for you and were friendly without being overbearing or annoying. Excellent business class seats with a massage function that reminds me of Delta First before the refurb. Could not more thoroughly recommend the Aer Lingus premium product. The entertainment suite is also excellent

### "would not use again"
Not Verified | Dublin to San Francisco. First time flying Aer Lingus long haul. Had been told it was the best way to the USA with pre clearance at Dublin. The day we travelled in October must have been Dublin Airports worst day as it took a full 2 hours in a queue to reach the immigration desks. My question is - has Dublin and Aer Lingus expansion into even more US cities started to affect the smooth running of this service? So needless to say everyone was stressed and flight departure times looming so hungry and thirsty we raced to our aircraft 1/4 full and an hours delay. No refreshments offered to those on board waiting and no interaction at all from crew. We had a relatively new A330-300 on our outbound journey which was generally pleasant and clean. Entertainment system poor. 1 hour into the flight we got a soft drink, only non-alcoholic beverages were complimentary. We then got our main meal and 3 or 4 hours in a small tub of ice cream was delivered. No other soft drinks service came round. Everyone kept walking up and down the aircraft trying to get water. I have never travelled long haul and had such poor service. The return journey was on an older A330-200 which was noticeably poorer. Bad sound on the entertainment system. Smaller screens and even worse if not poorer service. As it was a night flight the crew were even more absent and we felt like we were in a desert having to beg for liquid refreshment. Both journeys you get a 'snack' before landing. Aer Lingus seriously need to look at their catering as both legs it was vile. With all the problems we had, I would not use Dublin Airport or Aer Lingus again. Other carriers provide a much better product and service.

### " Overall really good airline"
Not Verified |  Dublin to Milan. Pretty decent, definitely better than Ryanair. It was on time, food was delicious but a bit expensive, it was 5 euro to get a can of soft drink. The seating was comfortable and I had lots of legroom. Overall really good airline.

### "had to buy wine or beer"
Los Angeles to Dublin. The planes was old and appeared tired and worn out. The service was minimal similar to a low cost airline. I had to buy wine or beer to have with my meal. Breakfast was bistro bun in a box. There was little interaction from cabin staff. The entertainment system had a limited choice of old movies. It was a sad reflection of Ireland national airline.

### "The seats are cramped"
Dublin to New York. The seats are cramped beyond belief, the website for checking in is atrocious, the policy of not issuing seats if a flight is booked 72 hours before takeoff is a disaster if travelling with children, and the 'lost and found' service has been outsourced in a way that makes sure that items of value are never 'found'. If there was a way to avoid Aer Lingus to get to Ireland, i would take it.

### "tried to cancel one of the hold bags"
Dublin to Amsterdam via Belfast. I overbooked hold luggage for a flight in January 2020 Dublin to Amsterdam. I tried to cancel one of the hold bags and get a refund as we wont need anywhere near the load I bought. Can you do this? No chance! There is no facility on their website to do this. We haven't even flown yet.

### "a big inconvenience"
Madrid to Chicago via Dublin. I came to Chicago for a very important meeting for the Thanksgiving weekend and my luggage was delayed. The meeting took place in Gainesville, GA. I had to leave Chicago the next day, November 27th, 2019. Due to the fact that my luggage was delayed I had to buy new clothing and all the necessary items needed that were in my luggage. This was a big inconvenience for me since the meeting I attended was 4 days long. I had to buy 6 extra outfits on top of toiletries. The luggage arrived at the airport 2 days later. At that time I was already in Gainesville, GA. The delivery company had called me while I was in the meeting. I got out of the meeting and I spent 20 minutes on the phone trying to find one of the host's neighbors to receive the luggage at 10PM. This, as well, was a big inconvenience. I asked for a different timing for the next day, but I was denied. When I called the claims department to make a complaint about this incident I was told I should have called earlier. I came from Spain to Chicago for a meeting that took place in GA. My schedule was very tight. I called the claims department as soon as I was available to call. At this point I am very disappointed how everything was handled. A luggage has to be with the passenger at all times. I understand that the luggage arrived 2 days later, but it was too late for me. I was out of town already without clothes and other necessities. The meeting was the highlight of my trip. The host's neighbor wakes up early. They can't be staying up to receive my luggage because the delivery company didn't want to accommodate the delivery for the next day. The neighbor wasn’t obligated to do this for me and if he hadn’t done it, the luggage could have been waited outside for a while. The agent from the Central Baggage Services has told me that I should have called earlier. I haven't traveled to the US to spend all my time on the phone, and I had to use the host's phone being in a different country. I travel every year and I used airplanes before, but this was one of the worst experiences I had! During the flight I didn’t receive food as promised. I wasn’t speaking English, so nobody stopped by to ask me if I was hungry or not. Nobody from the personnel was speaking Spanish. How shameful! I asked for a refund and they tell me they can't give me a refund because they didn't sell the ticket directly with me. They expect the agency where I bought the ticket from to give me a refund. The agency didn't do anything wrong. They just sold a ticket. What should they give me the refund?

### "unacceptable customer service"
Leeds to Boston via Dublin. Due to weather, other airlines made changes to itineraries but Aer Lingus published the flight as being on time. They never provided any updates and said there was no one available to help. The display boards in the Leeds airport said “update at 12:00” then “update at 12:30” then “update at 12:50” then finally after 1:00 the boards displayed “report to gate #“ We reported to the specified gate number to find complete confusion. After standing there for some time with no information, someone from Aer Lingus appeared and said we were being put on a bus to the Manchester airport. It took some time to get everyone loaded onto the bus then the same Aer Lingus person came to the front of the bus and made an announcement. The Aer Lingus person told us an airplane was waiting at the Manchester airport to take us to Dublin and said an Aer Lingus person would meet us at the bus upon arrival in Manchester and escort us. She also asked us to each call Aer Lingus at +353 1 761 7844 to get re-booked on the Dublin to Boston part of the trip. She added that if we couldn’t fly on to Dublin on Sunday that we would be put up in a hotel. It took about 80 minutes for an Aer Lingus representative to answer. A man finally came on the line and said he had no idea what I was talking about and he said he was sitting in New York and wasn’t sure how he could help. He did confirm that there was no way an airplane was waiting for us in Manchester and he finally booked us on a Dublin to Boston flight for Monday. We arrived in Manchester after a long bus ride to a complete customer service disaster. There was no one there to meet us as we got off the bus to escort us as promised. We weren’t sure what to do so we made our way to the Aer Lingus desk where they didn’t have a clue what was going on. They told us to use our original Aer Lingus boarding passes to get through security; obviously, after trying several times we realized that was impossible. We had to go back to the Aer Lingus desk and after another long wait, we were finally booked from Manchester to Dublin. When we arrived in Dublin, there was no one there to help us as promised. After a number of inquiries, we were told there’s an Aer Lingus customer service desk in the baggage claim area. We made our way to the Aer Lingus desk and again no one knew what we were talking about and no one had a clue how to help us, even though we were told this had all been sorted out. An Aer Lingus man didn’t know what to do so he called the Carlton Hotel and over the phone arranged for us to spend the night there. We took the shuttle and arrived at the hotel for the night. This ordeal took 14 hours with Aer Lingus lying multiple times along the way - totally unacceptable customer service, not to mention lost wages and the extreme anxiety their lies caused.

### "calculated indifference"
Seattle to Birmingham via Dublin . I booked a three-segment flight to Birmingham, UK, following the route SLC to SEA, SEA to DUB, DUB to BHX. The first segment was an Alaskan Airlines codeshare. I go to the Alaska Airlines counter at Salt Lake and check-in, as I could not check-in online due to the international segments. They check my luggage through to Birmingham, and tell me to print off my Aer Lingus boarding passes in Seattle. No big deal, I think. That's not an uncommon issue with codeshares. I land at Seattle, 6 hours in advance of my next flight's departure. I exit security and make my way to the Aer Lingus ticket counter. Which, as it turns out, isn't staffed. No problem! I think (foolishly). I'll just check in at a kiosk. Oddly enough, kiosk returns "Flight is not open for check-in. Okay, fine I go to check-in online. But my record locator isn't working, so I call customer service. I inform them I can't print my boarding passes. They give me a record locator and tell me to try checking in online. I try, and the "Reprint boarding passes" button is greyed out. Let's try the mobile app - nope, "No issuing boarding passes" error is returned. I call customer service again. Unapologetically, they tell me to just wait until they start staffing their single ticket counter at Seattle. They also tell me to try calling my travel agency (AmEx Global Travel, in this case, who I'd booked through). I call AmEx. They apologetically explain that they don't even have an agency dial-in to Aer Lingus; they can call Aer Lingus but will get the same runaround as I did. The AmEx agents are always good people. Fine. I decide to chat with an Alaskan rep, who is friendly and tells me "Yeah, Aer Lingus has a tendency to annoy a lot of travelers with their customer service approach. This is 2019. Printing boarding passes" is sort of a fundamental thing. The second rep I talked to on the phone told me "We're going paperless," which would be great if literally any of their IT toolkits worked properly. The agents didn't know when the kiosks would be available for check-in. Nor could agents release the flight for me to check in again, or authorize re-fetching my boarding passes, or email them to me, or send them via SMS, or authorize their access with their mobile app. If you look at Google Reviews, you'll see that Aer Lingus has a well-deserved 1.2 stars out of 5 at SEATAC. I won't fly Aer Lingus again. Basic customer service can't and shouldn't really be ignored - due to them, I spent 3 hours sitting outside the security zone at SEATAC because none of their agents were either trained or had permission to actually distribute boarding passes. This is senseless, and moreover *easily corrected. * This is not complex work, and not something any other transatlantic carrier operating in North America has issues with. 0/10. Failures happen. I'm not going to judge an airline by its errors, but by how it attempts to remedy them, which in this case, appears to be a determined course of calculated indifference.

### "my luggage was damaged"
I travelled from Toronto to Barcelona via Dublin. The flight was delayed in Toronto for an hour, when I got to Dublin i have to run to catch my connecting flight to Barcelona, when i reached the gate it was boarding already. I waited for my luggage for an hour, I approached the airport personnel who’s responsible for the lost luggage and was told to wait as they are still unloading. I waited patiently for more than 30 mins, my luggage never arrived. I was the only one waiting and the ground personnel left the office without checking if i got my luggage or not. The information desk at the airport made several phone call for the guy to comeback to assist me with my lost luggage. It took him more than 30 mins to comeback, he did the processing for the lost luggage and I was told that I was going to get an email but never did. Customer service was useless, I had to call more 10 times and used up all my minutes. The customer service are giving me different information every time I call. They even until my told me that my bag was delivered already but it was a lie. They told me they call me but never did no help or whatsoever. After 35 hours my luggage was finally delivered and to my surprise my luggage was damaged. My sister submitted a claim on my behalf (due to the time difference & international calling fees) and the only reply was for me to look for a repair shop which is impossible. First, it beyond repairable. Second, my itinerary is so hectic. I asked my sister email/phone again and until now no response. Losing & damaging my luggage & my struggle with customer service is ruining my trip.

### "don’t care about the bigger picture"
Dublin to London. I guess this applies to most airlines and not just Aer Lingus. I arrived at the airport early because I had a meeting cancelled. I saw there was a flight to LHR leaving an hour earlier than my flight to LHR. I went to the gate and asked if I could get on this earlier flight and they said no sorry it is full. So I went across the way and bought a snack. I then heard them paging five passengers for the flight as it was closing. I went up and asked again about getting on this flight and the person said it is not his call and pointed at another person who just looked at me and continued what he was doing. I left again and they then paged twice more for the missing passengers. I then went up again and asked if I could get on this flight as these missing passengers will likely want my seat on the later flight. He looked at me and said he cannot as he closed the flight five minutes ago. I said do you would rather have it go with a few empty seats? He said I can’t do anything I closed it already. It really baffles me why an airline would not do everything it can to go full and to have had an extra seat for these missing passengers who would likely need it. Not to mention the carbon footprint of not having a full plane. It seems that people at the gate were empowered to act for the best and now they just tick the boxes and don’t care about it look at the bigger picture. Rather sad.

### "lost my checked bags"
Toronto to London via Dublin. Tried to change my ticket the morning before my flight (added an extra 3 hours of layover). I managed to change it back thankfully. Delayed on the runway for an hour in Dublin, lost my checked bags. Customer service was useless, I had to call in 2 or 3 times a day until my bags were returned to have them fix the descriptions of the missing bags (completely lacked any form of common sense - listed all my bags as golf bag at one point?). Finally delivered all my bags three days later, and broke my expensive hiking backpack. I submitted my receipts a month ago and I have heard nothing from customer service about my reimbursement for interim expenses & backpack repairs (have ignored four emails now, I've only been able to make one phone call due to the time difference & international calling fees) Losing all my luggage & struggling with customer service to get it back completely ruined my trip. With so much of my gear & hiking bag missing, I wasn't able to do most of the excursions I had planned, and had to spend a good deal of time waiting around for my bags to be delivered. I understand that everyone is human, and mistakes happen during busy travel seasons, but this is over the top. I asked for the fee I paid to check my bag back (as well as reimbursement for the perishable goods that expired while my bags were missing), and they declined that as well as any other remedial gesture for their lack of competency. I went with Aer Lingus because the ticket was a little less expensive, and I don't mind a layover, but I know to never fly with this airline. It's not worth the $50 saved. Total mess.

### "it was a good flight"
Not Verified | Dublin to San Francisco. Cleared U.S Customs in Dublin, the plane was boarded in seat rows which was a bit of an inconvenience but luckily we were round row 15. After boarding, we spent another 40-60 minutes waiting for something. I was already a quarter through Toy Story 4! You were provided with a small comfy pillow, a blanket and a set of earphones. When we were airborne. An hour or two later, lunch came. Chicken, beef or a veggie option. I am not sure what the veggie option was but I think the beef was some meatballs. The Chicken which I had was this mushroom and chicken lasagna? Let’s just say I didn’t eat it. Down to preference though. There were some nice movie and TV selections. The screens were big too. The main problem was that after you had flown over Greenland, they forced you to put your window down so others could sleep. Now, we took off at around 11:30 AM in Dublin. This was around 13:00. After an hour of this, everybody was wide awake and it felt unnecessary. People would lift it up for a minute to look at the scenery so clearly people wanted to look outside. Fast forward a few hours, we are about one hour away. They serve this interesting pastry which I'm not sure what it was. It was okay. We were finally allowed to open the window blind when we started our descent. But apart from that, it was a good flight.

### "never had a problem"
Not Verified |  London to Belfast City. A smooth journey with Aer Lingus both ways. Check-in and boarding expertly handled and swift. Both flights on time (on the way back we arrived ahead of schedule). Cabin crew were friendly, professional and nothing was too much. I have been travelling to and from Northern Ireland for nearly 25 years now and have never had a problem with Aer Lingus. Long may it continue.

### "staff seemed to be on a go slow"
Not Verified |  Dublin to Izmir. Spent two hours queuing to check in. Staff at the check in desks were extremely slow and gave no apologies to anyone for the two hour queuing times. The check in staff seemed to be on a go slow and speed was beyond their ability. We all experienced this type of long waits, ten years ago not in 2019. It is embarrassing to see that an Irish company, such as Aer Lingus has not upskilled their staff in many years. We will now try and avoid flying with Aer Lingus.

### "experienced outright unfriendly behaviour"
Overall a passenger experience you would expect from a cheap budget airline. Staff at checkin and onboard generally procedure-focused, ‘must do this’, ‘cannot do that’. Several times I experienced outright unfriendly behaviour, but as you don’t want to be denied access, you’re better off accepting it, is my sense with them. Seat space on board very limited, drinks and food only offered for sale. Every time I fly Aer Lingus, I realise that you don’t fly Aer Lingus for any other reason than when you have no feasible alternative.

### "seat socket was not working"
This flight was a last-minute Thomas Cook caused replacement, therefore an expensive long flight from Dublin to Los Angeles. In the air, I discovered the headphone jack was the two-plug type and therefore could not be used with my 3.5 mm headphones with no adapter available, instead we were given headphones much like those sold in the dollar store. The second problem was that one of the two seat sockets was not working. So not only was the sound quality poor, I was only getting it through one ear. I called it to the attention of the flight attendant who checked and found that there were no other two seats together for me and my companion. So, in response to my 10-hour problem, she said, "I can give you a free drink..." Problem solved?

### "their behavior is just disgraceful"
On 3rd October Aer Lingus cancelled my flight from Dublin to Verona (I discovered it at the airport since they sent a cancellation email less than 2 hrs before the flight). They said that it was because of the storm Lorenzo but I'm sure it was just an excuse. How is it possible that all the other flights that were going to Milan, Bologna, Venice etc., that are not far away as the cow flies from Verona, departed without any issue and mine didn't? Aer Lingus just didn't want to spend money for a flight with only 40 passengers so they cancelled it and, luckily for them, they also had the perfect excuse that day, the storm. I was supposed to fly out at 12.55 pm and instead I flew to Milan Malpensa at 07.30 pm because also that flight had an hour delay, and in Milan we arrived to Verona airport at 02.30 am by a coach organised by an Aer Lingus representative. After that I had an additional hour to reach my home. I arrived home at 03.30 am after I had been waiting at Dublin airport since 11.00 am of the previous day. A trip that should have lasted maximum 8 hours took actually 17.5 hours and bevause of that I got sick during my holidays and now I'm back at work still sick. I have filled out their form to receive a compensation for this awful experience and they denied it! And in the email they also expect me to book with them again? I hope they are kidding! Their company and their behavior is just disgraceful, I'm never ever going to book with them in my life again.

### "They do not put their customers first and it shows"
Aer Lingus is a very poorly run airline. They encourage you to book your domestic and international travel through their website and then leave you to the wolves for your domestic travel. I booked a flight for work from Nashville, TN to Shannon, IR. Aer Lingus stated that I would be able to select my domestic travel seats directly with Jetblue. After booking I discovered that I cannot book a seat with Jetblue until 24 hours before the flight since I booked through a 3rd party (as in Aer Lingus). Also learned there were only middle seats left and I was out of luck. When I called Aer Lingus's US reservation center I was greeted by two very rude agents who treated me like I was disturbing their day. They informed me that they were unwilling to do anything to help. When I requested to cancel my domestic travel they said I would loose the entire fare and only get the government fees back. When I asked to talk to a supervisor they told me that were all busy and would call me back, never got the call! I encourage every international traveler to seek any other airline than Aer Lingus. They do not put their customers first and it shows!

### "worst airline I've ever flown with"
Not Verified |  Terrible! Absolutely terrible! Do not fly this airline. They're extremely rude, spoke down to both my wife and I, did nothing to fix the fact they were late upon arrival which made me miss my connection flight so I had to pay out of pocket a crazy amount of money for a hotel and taxis. The manager at Newark airport has no idea how to perform a good guest experience. And all you get when you try to contact their customer is service is "we're very sorry. That does nothing for me and my scenario. Do yourself a favor and fly any other airline you can no matter how much more it costs, I promise you'll be better off. Aer Lingus is the absolute worst airline I've ever flown with.

### "non-functional entertainment"
Zurich to Los Angeles via Dublin. It was the worst airline experience I've ever had. 1. Rip off during online check-in. They make you pay for a regular tourist class seat. I had to pay 65USD just for having a seat 2. Extremely poor, outdated and non-functional entertainment system. 3. Very unfriendly cabin crew 4. Very dirty cabin and toilets 5. Greasy, non-tasty meals 6. Wifi not working 7. Uncomfortably cold cabin temperature. Everyone was wearing jackets and hoods. No blankets available. Overall experience: This airline is overwhelmed by its operation. It feels like they don't know what they're doing.

### Aer Lingus customer review
Dublin to Seattle. My luggage was lost on Aer Lingus flight 143 to SEA on 9/26/19 - the reps at the carousel were clueless, they had no access to know if baggage was delayed, they could barely fill out the claims forms (which were very poor copies of an original so faint as to be unreadable). We waited almost an hour after bags starting arriving for them to confirm no more bags remained. I was given no reference # and they said someone would contact me in 2 hrs with the status of my luggage. No one ever called. I called back 5 hrs after the flight landed using the number on the claims form  - it was a off-shore call center (as confirmed later by a rep) but Aer Lingus waas not listed as one of the airlines for service - I used one of the other choices and the rep said they could help - now, 3 hrs after filling the claim i was told they had no record of the luggage and even though it was not in their system, it would arrive on the next day's flight. Next day, 3 hrs after that flight arrived I called again, and was again told they had no info - the rep this time told me in might have been delayed because the plane was "full" put me on hold while he 'contacted the airline. when he came back he said they had no further information - after additional questioning he admitted he had not actually contacted anyone and had no information confirming even the current location of my bag. 3 hrs later i called and was told the luggage didnt arrive but would be on Sunday's flight since they had no flights on the 28th. I asked why they didnt send it on another airline and was told that was not possible. I called again sunday night, 9/29 and the rep said my luggage had been 'expedited' but again he couldn't tell me whether it was on that flight or even where it was. Then he told me it had been scheduled to arrive either 9/27 or 9/28 on another airline - but he could not tell me what airline that was!

### "no service options"
Not Verified | Antwerp to Toronto via Dublin. Aer Lingus had a problem with the plane on the departure from Antwerp. Rather than ensure that connecting passengers to North America had some assurances that every effort would be made to access a connecting flight, they went silent. And they stayed silent after the email that advised us the plane was finally flown in from Dublin about 2 hours late. Aer Lingus has no portal on their web site that allows anything other than purchase, upgrades and changes to existing flights. They have no service agents available online or by telephone. If you call they will loop you through various options but when you choose a service agent they just start you in the loop again. The cabin staff will not discuss these matters and assure you that you will be dealt with in Dublin. In Dublin the staff just advise you to book a new flight after you are required to retrieve your baggage and not directed to any possible service centre other that one for those wishing to purchase tickets. So after a couple of hours of wasted time, you finally have to force an agent to assist you and she really just wants to book you sometime in the future and give you a hotel credit. And getting there is up to you. The problem with Aer Lingus is that they have no service options online or via telephone and the staff at Dublin is set up to sell tickets, not service victimized customers. I will never fly this airline again. They are a regional carrier that is trying to present itself as a real international carrier. Even now, 6 days after we landed back in Canada, they have not responded to any of our concerns. There is no one to do that.

### "The seats had poor pitch"
Dublin to London Heathrow on Aer Lingus. Having checked-in on line and traveling with carry-on only, I went straight to their lounge which I paid €30 to access. The lounge had very limited food on offer for a noon departure and one of the two coffee machines did not work. The staff were getting agitated as they constantly had to tend to the faulty coffee machine and the passengers were lining up to get served. It was a total waste of money as I would have had access to much better options in the terminal for the price I paid to enter the lounge. Boarding was orderly but commenced late resulting in a late departure. As I was boarding, the gate agent stopped me to tell me my carry-on had to be checked in which I went along with. Once on-board, I watched other passengers come through with more items and much bigger carry-ons than mine. The seats had poor pitch and I was glad I had paid extra for exit row. FA’s were pleasant but the service offering was abysmal with everything from water to coffee costing extra. It felt more like a discount rather than a mainline carrier. My seat pocket had a plastic cup left in it indicating cleaning was haphazard. When I pointed it out to the FA, she simply shrugged as if to say it was not her problem. As anticipated, the flight landed late. It was my first experience with Aer Lingus and hopefully the last.

### "they do not guarantee seats"
Not Verified |  Buyer beware! We flew out on September 5th, the flight was supposed to leave at 7:00 p.m. but did not leave until after 9:30. We were in the airport for 4 hours waiting. Then we did not get the seats we paid extra to get, even though we were the first people who booked that flight and chose our seats specifically. I chose the seat specifically so I would not bother anyone else. The poor guy next to me, I felt bad. When we got to Dublin, I talked to a ticketing agent who told me I would receive a refund. Since we had a long wait in Seattle, there were 3 of us traveling and I decided to book us into the Aer Lingus Lounge so we could have a comfortable wait. What they don't tell you is that the Lounge is before Customs. So we cleared Customs and went to the lounge and the girl told us you had to use the lounge before Customs. So, I sent an email to Aer Lingus and they told me that they do not guarantee seats and Administrative Fees are non-refundable. Never use this airline if you can avoid it.

### "haven’t got a clue where my baggage is"
Seattle to Edinburgh via Dublin. Flight was delayed for 4 hours. Baggage was lost and no one took any responsibility. Instead, they suggested I speak with their contractor, Menzies. I was on hold for 20 minutes and when I asked to speak to a supervisor the agent hung up. After 4 days and multiple phone calls they still haven’t got a clue where my baggage is and care little to find out. They’d rather just pay the lost luggage fee.

### "did not reply to my claim for refund"
Boston to Faro via Dublin. Aer lingus gave me the worst travel experience I've ever seen in over 30 years of frequent flying. tldr: Last minute flight cancellation, no reroute options, rude and slow customer service and non transparent and misguiding compensation and refund policy. Details: I booked a flight from Seattle to Faro connecting in Boston and Dublin to attend a wedding. The flight was supposed to land in Terminal 2 at 7 AM which as per the Irish department of justice website will not require entry into Ireland. Unless your arrival flight and onward connecting flight is in Terminal 2 between the hours of 0400 and 1600, you will need to go landside to make your onward connecting flight". First, my initial flight from Seattle was cancelled hours before departure. I accidentally checked my email before heading to the airport and found the notification. I called their customer support and was kept on hold for 90 mins, the customer service agent was rude and offered a reroute that arrives 2 days after my initial arrival date, which meant I will miss the main purpose of the trip and attend the wedding I am supposed to. When I asked him for an earlier option, he placed me on hold again and phone was disconnected after a min. I called again and waiting around 60 mins on hold again before I was automatically disconnected again. I called for a third time and finally got to an agent after almost 80 mins. She gave me another ticket that exchanged my 12 hour flight for a 24 hour flight with 10 hour wait in Boston. I accepted the offer since I had no other choice. Second: I did fly to Boston through a JetBlue flight and the agent did check me in and routed my luggage directly to Faro airport. I arrived in Boston and waited the 10 hours during which I checked in again with an aer lingus agent who checked my passport and gave me a boarding pass and explicitly marked "Visa OK" on it after asking me a number of time where my final destination is. At the gate, the agent asked all passengers to check in at the desk to confirm luggage. I did and he checked my passport and issued me a new boarding pass . An hour later, I was not allowed to board to the plane by the aer lingus agent as I don't have a transit visa to Dublin. I spent the next hours running from Jetblue agents to Aer lingus agents who exchanged blame in a rude and humiliating manner. Even calling Aer lingus support line didn't help. Eventually they offered to return me back to Seattle using my $1360 ticket. As a result, I missed my vacation and didn't attend my best friend's wedding, I lost the $1360 ticket and $2000 of hotel reservations, car rentals and other arrangements After almost one week, Aer lingus did not reply to my claim for refund or compensation, although the regulations mentioned on their website explicitly mention my right for compensation in case of one side cancellation.

### "didn't let me on board"
Amsterdam to Cork. Although there was a huge queue for the passport control at Amsterdam Airport and had to spend 45 minutes in security lines, I managed to get to the gate 15 minutes before departure time, but the assistant didn't let me on board, as the door was already closed. They ruined my birthday weekend with my family. They refuse to give any refund, the customer service is not available during weekends and during weekdays after 20 minutes waiting time they hang up if they receive a complaint.

### "My luggage was lost"
Los Angeles to Edinburgh via Dublin. Absolutely terrible customer service. My luggage was lost by Aer Lingus on 16/8/19 on the flight from Los Angeles to Edinburgh and despite chasing them up almost everyday I still do not have my luggage 11 days later! I keep getting promised a call back and nothing happens. Do not use them.

### "One of the best airlines"
Dublin to Lisbon. One of the best airlines I had the pleasure to fly with. Everything is well organized, with a good attitude and it actually functions similar to its flag country. In this company cabin crew matures well and become more professional and better hostesses. Well done.

### "a most pleasant experience"
Dublin to Bologna. I shall start by saying that I booked the flight many months ahead of my planned holiday. I booked with a travel agency and because of this Aer Lingus would not let me access their site to reserve a seat of my choice. Due to a medical issue I like an aisle seat. Eventually the Aer Lingus call centre let me pay for a seat. I was able to check-in online a few days before departure. The bag drop in Dublin was efficient and worked well. At present, Dublin is undergoing expansion and building work. I found myself placed on a transfer bus from one building to another and then entered what looked like an annex at the far end of the airport to stand number 35. So because of this passengers for this flight formed two sets of queues consecutively. One then had to walk towards the aircraft and passengers were left waiting in an exposed area for almost 15 mins. I did not see any assistance for elderly people, the frail or disabled people. The cabin crew were friendly, they made sure they presented the safety routine with a sense of purpose. The interior of the cabin was spotlessly clean. During this flight drinks and snacks were available for purchase. It was nice to see a native Italian speaker on the crew as most of the passengers were Italian people. The flight was just over 2 hours. During this time the captain only spoke twice and on both occasions he spoke so rapidly nobody could understand a word he said! There was no route map and the inflight magazine was ripped and tattered. The lavatory was clean. I noted that 2 of the cabin crew sat at the back of the flight for the duration of the journey and did little and allowed their colleagues to do all of the work. Disembarkation was quick and efficient. This direct flight is very convenient. There is a cheaper alternative with another airline. However. Aer Lingus has a more convenient departure time and by buying well in advance the price was reasonable for high season travel. Overall a rather reasonable experience. My concern though was the experience in Dublin airport and the lack of visible help for mobility impaired passengers. With all the building work going on better signage is needed too. A nice touch quite a few passengers commented on was the use of the Irish language. This is important in promoting Irish culture and heritage by the Irish national carrier. The aircraft used was an A320 and it was in the lovely dark green Aer Lingus colours rather than the new cut-back livery. I recommend Aer Lingus for their friendly and hardworking staff but with the proviso that they improve their communication in the airport. Overall it was a most pleasant experience.

### "big suitcase went missing"
We flyed from Tenerife to Dublin on the 06/08/2019. We arrived to Dublin on the 07/08 at 12:30am. Our big suitcase went missing. Now is 72 hours and still nothing! We filled Up the form on the airport with a very rude lady from aer lingus. I calling them every day since,but nothing. I called Tenerife airport and they confirmed that my bag leave Tenerife with me on the aircraft heading to Dublin. What else I Can do? Unprofessional service on the ground and aircraft as well.

### "Aer Lingus lost our baggage"
Aer Lingus lost our baggage on a flight from Dublin to Edinburgh 7 days ago. We did everything we were asked. We gave the address to the hotel where we were staying but the baggage never arrived. We requested that the baggage be sent to Glasgow Airport and held until Friday August 2nd Where we would be flying out of next and Aer Lingus representative agreed to do so and we have a confirmation. Once we arrived in to Glasgow Airport we were told the baggage was sent back to Edinburgh for some unknown reason. We have traveled without personal belongings for 7 days because the team has lied to us and been unprofessional. After many phone calls, emails, and claims on their website we still are unsure where the baggage is or if we will ever see it again. We have requested that the baggage be mailed to our home to which they agreed. As of this morning however they can no longer locate our baggage. This is bad communication, bad service, and overall unprofessionalism.

### "our flight was cancelled"
Gatwick to Knock. Flight number EI 911 on the 10th july at 17.25. Arrived at Gatwick at 15.00 pm checked in. Sitting on plane at 17.00 to be told there was problem with air traffic computer and we could be waiting a while so at 19.00 we were told our flight was cancelled. We were told to collect our luggage and go to check in desk to arrange our flight and to sort out accommodation. Arrived at check in desk behind a very long que which I stood on for over 2 hours to get to the top and be told there is no seats available to knock until Saturday 13th. I could not wait an extra 3 nights took a flight to Dublin which was also delayed for 2hours. The time was now 22.00 and we were not offered as much as a bottle of water. No Aer Lingus ground staff were to be seen. Sat on flight to Dublin for 1hour 30min before flight took off. Arrived in Dublin at 02.00 the following morning to be told there was a bus to take us to Knock which is a 3 hour 30min drive away. I was not getting a bus at that hour as I was exhausted and would not have been able to get to my home from knock at that hour so got a taxi to my friend and the next day had to get a bus to knock so I arrived in knock at 22.35 on the 11th 28 hours after I should have arrived at knock airport. I have tried to get compensation and they have told me I will not get anything as I got the flight to Dublin however they will refund me the 28.60 I paid for a taxi but not my bus. I should have been offered something for all the inconvenience.

### "a very positive experience"
Bilbao to Dublin. Very reasonable fare at €84 for Summer. Full flight but cabin baggage dimensions seemingly not an issue as none were checked. Plenty of overhead space despite a full capacity flight. Passport check (non-Schengen) lead directly to gate and due to a long line here boarding was therefore immediate. Gate staff were warm & friendly. Flight crew were courteous, smiling & friendly. Spotted one particular cabin crew doing her utmost to reseat a female passenger who was separated from her group. Flight departed on time and we had regular & very precise routing info from the cockpit as we flew to Dublin. Very informative. Arrived 15m ahead of schedule though we had a short delay to stand as “gate” area was occupied by outbound flight. This was the first time ever arriving into Dublin & having to be transported to the main T2 building by bus. Though this is an airport capacity issue more than Aer Lingus’. Overall, a very positive experience and look forward to flying with them again.

### "terrible experience at every level"
7/12 ready to fly home from Edinburgh to Hartford CT via Dublin. We were told the connector from Edinburgh to Dublin was late and we couldn’t fly to Hartford. We were re-routed to Heathrow and then to Boston and were told by Aer Lingus that we were ‘on our own in Boston’. We had to wait at he Edinburgh airport for 5 hours before boarding the flight to Heathrow and were given a measly 5 pound credit for food. When we complained about being stuck in Boston at 9:30p.m. They said this happens all the time. Basically they couldn’t get rid of us fast enough. A terrible experience at every level.

### "now our flight is delayed"
Not Verified |  Chicago to Amsterdam via Dublin. This review is a long time coming. I’d like to start off on a positive note. Betty and her colleagues working at the check-in desk at O’Hare on the evening of June 27, 2019 were life savers. These women went above and beyond to help me get on an earlier transfer flight, and deserve to be acknowledged. Unfortunately, all other circumstances surrounding my trip were nightmare-ish. I chose to fly them again due to the cost and convenience from Chicago. During my last trip with Aer Lingus my luggage was lost during a connection from Dublin to Rome. Hours and hours were spent on the phone with essentially no help. The only reason I recovered my bag was pure luck. I went to the airport to see if miraculously my bag made it on the same flight the next day and it did. Albeit, it was sitting in the middle of the airport and no one ever contacted me that it had arrived! I received zero compensation for this inconvenience despite submitting a claim to the airline. I booked with Aer Lingus again after the last disaster because the price was significantly less, and the in-flight experience is not terrible compared to some airlines. First, plans changed prior to my departure and the customer service line was worthless. Prepare to be on hold for an hour and then speak with an operator that is prepared to do nothing to assist you. If you must fly this airline and run into an issue with your departure, the only option is to work with personnel at the origin airport directly. Additionally, the check in process at every airport (aside from O’Hare) has been run with zero efficiency. At my recent check in departing from Amsterdam back to the USA, there were two employees working the desk. A family was dealing with an issue and it held up the line for an hour. It would have made much more sense to have them step aside and work with them after the majority of passengers had checked in. The line system itself is also ridiculous. There were two lines marked “check in” and “bag drop” but since most flyers were unable to check in online (another annoyance), it was unclear if there was any differentiation in the line. This created much discord between the passengers waiting and arguments as to whose turn was next. Although I arrived at the airport with almost three hours to spare, given the check-in snafu, I felt I had to rush through security and customs. As such, I did not check my boarding pass and only realized while arriving at security that the agent did not print out a boarding pass for my transfer flight. I rushed to the gate to inquire whether they could print a pass there because of the error at check-in. They told me that they could not assist me and my only option was to re-check in at the Dublin airport. I have an hour and 35 minute layover and also have to go through US customs, so how will this be feasible? Further, now our flight is delayed and there is a very solid chance I will miss my connection back to a Chicago. All in all, do your best to avoid flying this airline at all costs. The consistent terrible service and inefficiency you will encounter every step of the way is not worth any amount of savings.

### "try a different airline next time"
Boarding was chaotic - they cram all the passengers on one bus for a lengthy wait and then drive to the airplane. The plane itself is tiny and very old, with the seats very close together - you can feel the knees of the passenger behind in your back - and for some reason they filled up every seat toward the front and then left rows of empty seats in the back of the plane, nearest the one exit. There were two flight attendants, one  was very rude, and another who spilled some kids milk all over me and my iPad as she was carrying trash down the aisle. I’ll give it a 4 out of 10 though, because at least it got me to my destination and it flies to/from Newquay which is a brilliant little airport, but I will try a different airline next time. There are alternatives with newer planes and more/better service from Exeter. Sadly that means not using Newquay.

### "pathetic and unacceptable"
Boarded 10.45 flight EI891 Lisbon to Cork on June 29th 2019. Have to say never boarded a flight that smelt so bad in my life! The staff did not acknowledge this when I brought it to their attention!!! Sat for 2 hours before disembarking due to a wheel problem which needed a new wheel to be flown from Dublin the following morning. This part I get, unexpected things happen. To be honest, though, a spare wheel must be available on site. I don’t know much about flying a plane but it would seem pretty basic to me! Communication and clarification were sparse at best. Lost sheep - I know what they are now! No hotels booked, no details of the alternative flight, no plan made for any person in that flight (except the Aer Lingus staff who headed off to their pre-booked hotels). I will add that those on the flight included the elderly, infirm and wheelchair bound. It’s 1 am and entire flight left to our own devices to survive a late night in Lisbon. About 50 people slept on the airport floor, no water, no blankets. An €18 meal voucher received at about 1 pm on June 30th. Email confirmation received for 1 pm initially, then corrected to 2 pm, later ”confirmed” for 8.05 pm. This is farcical. It’s not what I expect from our national airline! The level of customer service is pathetic and unacceptable. I am annoyed that we could not have been told last night to arrive at a more reasonable hour. According to Ground Force in Lisbon there was never a slot available to fly at 2pm. In all of this time, there was no sign of any Aer Lingus staff. Ground Force may be contracted by Aer Lingus as airport admin but to be honest, we would deserve better than this! Aer Lingus did issue a message saying that air traffic control had restricted their ability to make a departure at 2 pm. Lisbon airport ground control told us there was no such slot available! Why can’t people tell the truth? Seemingly no slot was available and so I find myself sitting unnecessarily at the airport unable to even check in! Very, very poor reflection on Aer Lingus as a company. I understand perfectly that flights are delayed. I understand perfectly that things don’t always go to plan. I do not understand how events like this are handled so badly. What a pity as this is what defines an organisation. Frustrated, annoyed and tired.

### "worst customer service"
Not Verified |  Dublin to London. I had a flight booked as a stop over with another airline. I flew Aer Lingus just to transfer airports to the actual airline I booked through. Because of this third party booking I could not use the kiosk to print my boarding pass. I asked the woman at the kiosk for help and she told me to use the kiosk, when I explained the issue she told me that the kiosk was the only way to print my boarding pass. I tried to get help at the ticketing counter and was told they could not help because I had already purchased a ticket. By this point I was an hour and fifteen minutes into the process. I then stood in another line to get help from the baggage drop. Two people in a row went on break as I got to the front of the line leaving one person to help close to 200 people still in line. Then she shut down her line to help priority board the people who’s gates had closed. Finally got my boarding pass print after almost two hours in line. I then tried to check my bags in the automated line and was flagged because I was flying to the United States. I waited almost 5 minutes for someone to notice the big red light over my bags and come assist. No one did. I asked the man sitting in the empty line next to me for help (business class assistance line) and he told me that he would not help and that I needed to go find someone who would help me. Finally managed to find help. All in all it took over two hours to print a boarding pass and check my bags. I emailed customer service to simply make them aware of these issues and they have been more than unhelpful. She told me she could not help because I would not give her a valid booking number even though I have explained several times that I do not have one for her airline since I did not book with them to begin with. She also decided to assign a gender role when speaking with me. When I corrected her mistake and explained that I was offended by her presumption I was told it was my fault for not providing my gender when filing my complaint. I was so shocked by her response that I felt the need to address it with her supervisor. I asked twice to be transferred to a supervisor and in response they have stopped responding to my emails. All I wanted to do was let this company know about the problems I experienced. Instead I have receive some of the worst customer service of my life.

### "my luggage was misplaced"
On the 13.06.2019. I had my flight with Aer Lingus from Dublin to Lyon. I purchased two hour lounge access with it for EUR 30.00 as i had a good experience with Dublin Airport lounges in the past. This is the most pathetic excuse for an airport lounge i have ever seen and i been to a lot of them. The selection of drinks was limited. The place was dirty, there was no food. Next door, there is a far better lounge. After that my flight was delayed but nobody cared to communicate this to us. Then on the 16.06.2019. I could not view my boarding pass even though i had checked in the day before. I had to go to the counter to check in. We arrived a little later at the Dublin airport, where my luggage was misplaced. I spoke to the ground staff and reported luggage as missing. Asked the ground staff on how to proceed next, and was advised they will find my luggage within 72 hours. 72 hours later still no luggage but an SMS to call them. After speaking to an associate for 30 minutes and not getting anywhere i asked for a supervisor and was promised a supervisor call back in an hours time. 20.06 filled out lost baggage survey and called customer support as i did not receive promised supervisor call back. Was transfered to a supervisor who told that this will be resolved in 5 days. I asked him what will happen if not, he said that this won´t be the case. That if not found they will consider it lost! 21.06 in the late afternoon called them again. Spoke to another person telling me that they found my luggage and will deliver it to be today or tomorrow. 22.06 late afternoon called again as i haven´t received my luggage. was advised, that they are still checking if this is my luggage. Then on the 25.06 i called again asking for an update. They said they still don´t have one. I asked to talk to supervisor and was promised a supervisor call back within an hour. At 07:00 pm i called again insisting to speak to a supervisor and spoke to the most incompetent supervisor i have ever dealt. If a customer doesn't have their luggage for several days has spend hours on the phone you do not sigh at them. I also escalated to Aerlingus via fb while they were quick to respond, no body took accountability for the action. Nobody from the complaints department reached out to me to find out what happened.

### "said that they are too busy"
My wife is in the airport carrying her luggage and our baby boy in a car seat, since Aer Lingus lost our buggy which she would attach to car seat. She asked the Aer Lingus staff at the airport to help her to carry the babyseat and surprisingly they said that they are too busy. I cannot believe that there were not at least 1 staff that could help my wife to carry our baby in the car seat to the bus station, which is 3 minutes from the entrance door. My wife just needed 5 minutes of your time ok? The "busy" staff. Never had any complain about this airline, they are really good. Please get your ground staff in some customer service training to handle this situations.

### "staff was helpful and nice"
Dublin to London City. Good services at Dublin airport, the Aer Lingus staff was helpful and nice. Staff was sufficient in number, queue was small and managed properly. Slight delay possibly because of weather.

### "Bad communication on flight delay"
Amsterdam to Dublin. Bad communication on flight delay - basically none, arriving plane only landed 10min before planned take-off still no information. Yes, planes are delayed all the time but a minimum of straight forward communication should be possible. Also very unfriendly personal randomly picking hand luggage to be checked in and somehow picking exactly does people who then had their hands full of stuff like batteries, Computers and such that are not allowed to be checked in. Seriously needs to improve staff training and communication procedures.

### "nothing to help me retrieve bags"
Brussels to San Francisco via Dublin. I have never in my life experienced such poor customer service. I booked a flight from BRU to SFO, but due to weather and slow ground operations at DUB airport I ended up missing my connection to SFO. I got rebooked onto a flight from DUB to JFK and JFK to SFO. Not only did this add 15 additional hours to my trip; they also managed to lose my bags in JFK. When I finally arrived in SFO at 3am after 30h of traveling, all 3 of my bags were missing. Additionally I had made a bid to upgrade to business class, based on the information I was given: a flight from DUB to SFO. However when I got rebooked, I got downgraded to economy for the second leg of the flight. And of course, availability isn’t always there, but when I raised this issue with them, they refused to compensate me or give me a partial refund. Over the course of 4 days I made over 16 phone calls, filled out multiple complaint claims, reached out to them on twitter. But they did nothing to help me retrieve my bags. I kept getting the same standard answer over and over again: As American Airlines were your final carrier they will need to trace the missing baggage. In our industry, it's the final carrier's responsibility to return the delayed baggage. They will work directly with us on your behalf to return the bags to you as soon as possible. And indeed, they tried to work with Aer Lingus. They put in 3 requests to get the bags transferred onto their system. But Aer Lingus was  unresponsive. I also reached out to Aer Lingus’s own delayed baggage department, who also put in a request and sent 2 emails to raise this issue. Yet again, not a single response from Aer Lingus. As a result, my bags are still being held hostage in the Aer Lingus terminal at JFK. After yet another attempt to raise awareness with Aer Lingus on twitter, I got shut down without any meaningful response. This seems to be their thing: making customers go away as fast as possible while providing zero help. Filing a complaint on Aer Lingus has been designed to frustrate and infuriate people. Of course, things won’t always go according to plan, and often there’s not much that can be done about it, but a company like Aer Lingus should have a proper system for dealing with complaints in a timely manner, supported by caring staff. Putting customers through the same form over and over again is only designed to make them go away.

### "I just want my bag returned"
Dublin to Seattle. Airline refused to check my bag all the way through to Denver and said Air Alaska was not partnered with them. Flight was 2 hours late leaving Dublin. Had no time to get bag and go to Air Alaska and recheck through. After arriving in Denver filed a complaint for last luggage. It’s been 3 days and not a phone call to me from Aer Lingus. All my info address and phone number are on my bag. They will not answer the phone when Air Alaska calls. My travel agent and Air Alaska keep trying to reach them and no response. I have filed a complaint with the airline with a response they will contact my in the next 14 days. I just want my bag returned. I’m very frustrated with the lack of care or response as from the airline.

### "Meal service slow"
New York to Dublin. Boarded 40mins before take off. Champagne offered and accepted. It was served at room temperature. Not offered a top up. Entertainment system did not work initially and took about 20 mins to get it up and running. Meal service slow. Other side of cabin completed before our side served. The cabin manager usually takes the left side facing forwards but they did not make an appearance for the meal service. When the food was served it was lukewarm and I had to ask for a wine top up. My wine glass was empty for 40 mins through the meal service. Having travelled with EI to the States in Business about twice a year, I have to say the trend in not good. The WiFi service out and back from the States was broken (not the same aircraft). The seat prices are on the high side but out of loyalty (Concierge member) I have stuck with them. But no more. I’m going to see what the American carriers are like on the route. Having recently travelled with Qatar, EI Business is simply not in the same league.

### "situation was handled poorly"
On May 5th, 2019 my husband and I had a flight going from Naples to Dublin, Ireland (with Aer Lingus), then from Dublin to New York JFK airport, NY (Aer Lingus) and then from New York to Tampa with Jetblue. Our flight from Dublin, Ireland to New York (JFK) on May 5th was supposed to take off at 4:20 PM (16:20), however it did not take off until approximately 10:00 PM (22:00). We landed in New York, NY at 11:05 PM (EST.) We were supposed to arrive in New York, NY at 6:55 PM (EST.) When we arrived at the gate in Dublin there were no employees available to speak to. After some time, they announced the flight would be 15 m delayed. Approximately every 1-1.5 hours they continued to push back the time the flight would leave without any explanation. Finally, they announced it was delayed because of technical difficulties. We were also told that we would not be told if we would make it to Tampa that night until we landed in New York, NY. When we exited the plane, we were given a printed ticket with a time for 9:54 AM the next morning  to arrive in Tampa, FL at 1:00 PM pm May, 6th 2019. We were originally supposed to be in Tampa at 11:18 PM on May 5th, 2019. We were not able to get into the hotel until 1:30 AM including time for waiting for customs, shuttles, and long line at the hotel. The next morning, we arrived 3 hours early at the jetblue gate (on the email it instructed to check in at jetblue and we could not check in online.) While at the Jetblue checkin, the jetblue employee told us that Aer Lingus had not finished completing our booking, and that there was nothing they could do about it. She also told us the flight was almost full, and we may not be able to get on the flight. At this point we were beyond frustrated and upset. We called Aer Lingus and told a representative our problem. She put me on hold for approximately 20-30 minutes. She then said Aer Lingus had not finished the booking and then she finished the booking. We were then able to get our tickets. Our flight to Tampa was also slightly delayed due to fuel issues. We landed in Tampa at 1:30 PM (a total of 14 hours and 10 min after the original arrival scheduled time.) We were given 16 euro worth of vouchers at the airport for food in Dublin. This delay in the flight caused both me and my husband to miss work until 3 PM on Monday. The situation was handled poorly without little information and not booking our tickets.

### "onboard service is excellent"
Flew on the EI934 at 13:10pm Belfast to London Heathrow. The check in process at Belfast George Best Airport is a lot to be desired as staff are really not interested in the best interest of passengers. To them it is mere a task. The boarding process goes by priority boarding which you have to pay for, however this was good and the boarding process was good and quick. The onboard service is excellent, although you have to pay for snacks and drinks they are served fast, efficiently and with a smile. The aircraft left Belfast on time and arrived in Heathrow on schedule. The baggage was also delivered very quickly in London. I note that the Check in and ground staff in Belfast George Best Airport are not Aer Lingus staff and that might explain the lack of professionalism and customer care.

### "all the crew members were very unfriendly"
Conclusion: avoid Aer Lingus if you are traveling as a family. They do not respect the value of family and no one is willing to take any responsibility after our horrible experience with them. What happened: We booked a returned flight from/to Toronto to Frankfurt. We were traveling with our 9 month old baby. Right after we booked and paid the tickets, we called the agent to request a baby bassinet and priority seats both ways immediately. We flew from Toronto to Frankfurt with bassinet, no problem. But the agent said we need to make another call before our return flight to reserve the bassinet. 48 hours before our return flight on April 1st, we called the Aer Lingus office in Germany where we would board the flight. They told us they have no access to the seating system and asked us to go to the airport counter for requesting the bassinet. We arrived three and a half hours before the scheduled flight time to check in and to request the bassinet (We were the second in line after the counter was opened). The person on the counter told us, she has no access to the flight from Dublin to Toronto, which is the long flight after our first short flight from Frankfurt to Dublin. She asked us to request the bassinet seat when we transferred at Dublin airport. I asked her, there will only be less than 2 hours transfer time, wouldn't the seats all be taken? What if we do not get a bassinet seat? She said she cannot help and we can only go and find out there. We arrived at Dublin airport, when we went to check in for the second flight, which is going to be 7 and half hours long from Dublin to Toronto. The lady at the counter said there is no bassinet seats anymore and she cannot help us. She told us rudely that there is nothing she can do and we can only go board the plane and ask the cabin crew for the seat change. We boarded the plane EI129, and of course it is full and there was no single crew member who was willing or able to help us at all. We were sitting in the middle seats. Carrying a 9 month old baby at hand. No extra seats or spaces were beside us. And all the crew members were very unfriendly to us. One of them told us it was because there was a last minute cabin change so two families with babies could not get the bassinet seats including us. They even told us: sorry this happened every week I saw many families always left without their requested prioirity seats in the end especially for Sunday and Monday flight. During the whole 7 and a half flight, we did not feel well at all. No one helped us, no one cared about us. Even when my husband was standing beside the hallway to rock the baby and tried to let her sleep because our seats were so tight and small she couldn't nap, one of the crew member came to us and said we cannot stand there. (The seat belt sign was not on at the moment). The baby was crying nonstop because she was so tired but kept getting disturbed by these actions. We asked to speak to the cabin manager three times, and throughout the whole flight not once he came to communicate with us. We felt deeply sad about the unfortunate experience. We contacted Aer Lingus customer service and no one is willing to take responsibility and respond to us.

### "service was nice and reasonably priced,"
This flight was operated by Cityjet for Aer Lingus. It started off badly with London City Airport being closed, and severe slot delays. Our flight eventually left from Dublin 2.5 hours late to come and pick us up. However, about 15 minutes before the plane landed, they cancelled the flight, despite the plane now being on the ground. However, there was a flight meant to be 55 minutes later, which was also an hour late, and they arrived within 15 minutes of each other. So we now had 2 flights worth of people to fit onto 1. But the staff were very calm and professional, despite clearly not having a good day. They asked everyone with a connecting flight to come forward to be rebooked first, and despite my onward journey being on a different airline, they let me on first. Onboard the plane, the cabin was very tight. The service was nice and reasonably priced, and the flight itself was uneventful. Just like most of my flights, I did this one just for the type of plane, the Avro RJ85, which was a real highlight, and I really enjoyed being able to fly on this plane. I loved it, and would do it again before this type of plane gets retired. If you are a plane geek, I highly recommend this flight. If you aren't, then maybe not.

### Aer Lingus customer review
London to Baltimore via Dublin. The flight was so frustrating with no enough details what causes the delay. A very poor planning and disorganised way to cater a disruptive flight. Passengers were sitting inside the airplane for more than 2 hours. No instruction was made from the airline crew after the late arrival in Dublin. We were not made aware on how and where to find our next steps. It was chaotic and exhausting day for everyone. This causes missed flight connection without alternative flights on the same day. We were queuing for more than 4 hours in the customer service area with only 2 staff rebooking the flights for the following day for more than 20 passengers.

### "upgrades were not refundable"
I naively offered $50 more to upgrade when they sent me an offer. A day or so later, I got a message that my offer to upgrade by $840 had been accepted. I got on the phone and email immediately. I wasted six or so hours (when I needed to be getting ready for the trip) trying to straighten out what I at first thought was a misunderstanding. I finally heard from guest services, who apologized for the inconvenience, but said upgrades were not refundable. I wrote back that it wasn't a matter of inconvenience, I couldn't afford the charge. I didn't hear back. I contacted my credit card company to dispute the charges. When I got to the desk in New York, I said I wanted my seat in economy, the one I'd paid for. One clerk was helpful, but a supervisor came and said an upgrade was not refundable. I said, "My credit card company is disputing the charge. He looked at his screen and found me a seat in economy. At first I was grateful, but later felt miffed that I, the customer, had no one's ear, but mentioning the big credit card company finally got someone's attention. At least my return flight would be no hassle, that remained an economy ticket. Two nights before my departure, I got a note saying I had been upgraded again, for $890 this time. It said, "Do not reply to this note. My phone didn't work in Europe. I sent guest services a note, much less polite this time, ordering them to restore my economy ticket. I didn't hear back. I didn't fly home with Aer Lingus. I missed my connection, and by then believed it was futile to try to get through to that airline, so flew home with another airline. It is a horror trying to get through to them.

### "frequent flyer service is shocking"
Not Verified |  Flights are OK. However the aerclub frequent flyer service is shocking. I have had several flights that have not shown up on their system. After filling in an online update nothing happened. Since then I have spoke to 5 customer service reps, confirmed and verified missing dates, raised 2 concerns and Still nothing has been done, I now should be Silver Tier and fly next week. My concern is now over 6 weeks old, last week ago I sent yet another polite but factual email requesting them to address the problem and requesting a reply and explanation of why their has been a delay, and also to offer help leaving my phone number, email etc. Guess what heard absolutely nothing. I have never dealt with a frequent flyer customer service this poor..... ever!

### "crew was polite and attentive"
Paris CDG to Dublin. Nice trip with space for my legs, the seat was big enough but i was too cold in the cabin. The crew, despite it was just the end of the night was polite and attentive to all my requests.

### "a very comfortable flight"
I was one of the thousands stranded by WOW airlines abroad. A lot of articles suggested Icelandair had you open a case, send all your personal information to prove you had paid already & told you to call to get a discounted rate as a rescue fair (the fair provided to me would have caused me to miss my flight within the states back home and been more than I could purchased for a normal flight on the open market through other carriers). I called Aer Lingus and asked if they were giving discounted rates, they where sympathetic, got me on a flight and gave me a discount with out jumping through hoops. They really were there for the stranded passengers abroad. I had a very comfortable flight from Dublin to Newark. I highly recommend this carrier!

### "An appalling experience"
London to Cork. An appalling experience at the hands of the call center over a simple query requesting a seat change to sit with my 9 year old son. When I politely requested to be put through to a supervisor / manager because of how poorly he was handling my request, the agent hung up on me. Absolutely disgraceful!

### "our tickets changed twice"
Edinburgh to Miami via Dublin. Had our tickets changed twice at short notice ending up with a whole day sitting in Dublin Airport with young children. No apology, just get on with it. Try emailing guest relations which is a joke as they are simply not bothered, I presume due to the extremely high number of complaints. Yes its cheap but without a doubt at a high price when it comes to service.

### "friendly and very helpful"
Not Verified |  Dublin to Toronto. Flight staff were friendly and very helpful. The inflight meal in economy class was pretty decent, and the seats were comfortable as well. Flew for less than what other low-cost carriers charge and got way better service and comfort.

### "should clean up their flights"
Brussels to Dublin. I fly quite a lot and have flown with Aer Lingus before but on my last couple of flights I arrived to my seat to find it covered in rubbish from the previous flight, including food and used tissues on the floor. Other than that I usually enjoy my flights with them but they really should clean up their flights.

### "flight was enjoyable"
Düsseldorf to Dublin. Boarding started on time and the plane started on time. The whole staff was friendly offered help and was in a good mood. The tea was good. Seats are modern and the legroom is above average. The whole flight was enjoyable.

### "there was very little leg room"
Dublin to Tenerife. Selected two economy class seats for myself and my partner on Aer Lingus flight to Tenerife. We were dismayed to find there was very little leg room, much less than the other rows, and the seat backs could not be reclined. The seats were in Row 11 which was immediately in front of an emergency exit. However there was no indication on the online seat selection plan that there were any issues with these seats - the fact that they were shown as available to reserve at the same price as seats in adjacent rows surely implies they would be of the same standard. My partner was particularly upset as she suffers from arthritis and severe back pain - it would have been intolerable for her in these seats on a four hour flight. We asked a steward if we could move, and he said we could once the plane had reached safe altitude. However there was no apology. We did move then, to seats which were perfectly satisfactory, but we were lucky that there were such spare seats available! Aer Lingus appear to be selling sub-standard seats under false pretences. You might say that we should have checked first with Seatguru but it should be clear from the airline website. Also the flight attendant staff often appear to have little regard for their customers who they seem to view as an inconvenience and a restriction on their ability to continuously chat with one another.

### "the flight was very smooth"
Easy flight with no complaints. Cabin crew were nice and the flight was very smooth. The flight felt a bit long and there was no in flight entertainment. A very average experience.

### "the worst flight experience"
Shannon to Edinburgh with Aer Lingus. By far the worst flight experience to date. Our flight was delayed over 5 times with no information given to us. All they gave us were 5 dollar vouchers to buy a drink which obviously does not equal the amount of time wasted and stress that was caused because of the 6 and a half hour delay. The flight was quick but the ATR planes are extremely noisy and you could really feel how small the plane was inflight. Not a pleasant experience.

### "they were absolutely fantastic"
Manchester to Los Angeles via Dublin with Aer Lingus. I took ill on the return flight from LA to Dublin. The air stewards had been most attentive and friendly all flight but when I became ill, they were absolutely fantastic. I cant praise them enough. Also the paramedics at Dublin airport.

### "I managed to get to the gate"
Frankfurt to Toronto via Dublin. On my ticket the departure terminal was Terminal 2 and my flight arrived at T2. After a long wait in airport bus they took us to flight connections at T2 and there they told us our departing flight would be from T1. So I had to walk for 20 minutes to get to T1. There, on flight information boards the departure gate for my flight was 307E. Finally I could catch one of the airport personal and he told me that must be wrong on board and it has to be 307A since there was no 307E. Finally I managed to get to the gate as last passenger or so. I told the crew a bit of what happened and the only thing they said was :” oh”.

### "suggested we seek a refund online"
I booked a Boston to London via Dublin flight for me and my wife on the Aer Lingus website. The fare I chose included 1 checked bag and 1 carry-on per person. When I reached the payment stage, instead of confirming that I had already purchased a checked bag because it was included in my fare, the website asked if I wanted to purchase a checked bag and warned that it would be more expensive to do so at the airport. So (unbeknownst to me) I purchased another checked bag. When I checked in for the flights online the day before the flight, the website again asked if I wished to pay to check any bags and warned that it would be more expensive to do so at the airport. Again the website did not reflect that I had actually already paid for 2 checked bags! This was misleading at best and fraudulent at worse. At the airport my wife and I checked in with two carry-on bags and one checked bag. The check in attendant indicated that we had paid to check 4 bags. The attendant refused to provide a refund and suggested we seek a refund online. I submitted a claim and received no response.

### "refused to help me"
Aer Lingus staff in the airport refused to help me in any way. I missed a connection booked by Aer Lingus due to delay of previous Alaska Airlines connecting flight. I was redirected by another airline through Chicago, London (with 8 hour unwanted layover) then Belfast. It took me 46 hours to complete the trip and my luggage took 80 hours to arrive. I submitted complaint form to Aer Lingus and as yet have had no response. I have made numerous attempts to contact them via Facebook page and once again have received no help. The journey cost me over £300 in additional expenses. No mention of compensation or acknowledgment of my complaint. I did not actually manage to even get on an Aer Lingus flight at all and can therefore not give them any rating for service.

### "seats denied on both flights"
Dublin to Newark. Nightmare flights to and from Ireland this Christmas. Being disabled with and severe limited mobility, bulkhead seats that I booked and selected online were denied on both flights. For the outbound, I was told there was a aircraft change and so the seats were to bumped to middle of row in front of the bulkhead, with no recline. I made sure to call Aer Lingus twice during my stay to ensure we had the correct seating for the return journey. Both times we were guaranteed that our seats were correct and it also reflected “extra legroom” in the Aer Lingus App. On our return flight, I decided to check with the gate agent on our seating. He started off by stating that is illegal for someone like me to sit in those seats and said authorities may have to be called. I tried to correct him by say that these were bulkhead seats and not an exit row. He stated that disabled folks have no extra rights on a plane and that babies will always come first. I was stunned at this. Then comes the boarding and not once were people with mobility issues invited to preboard. So we were again seated in middle seating.

### "good value for money"
San Francisco to London Heathrow via Dublin. Overall cost around 500 euro which I thought was good value for money. The flight from SFO to DUB boarded on-time and the check-in was straightforward, although the flight was delayed for 1 hr on the ground due to the poor weather. However, once we got airborne this lost time was made up. The seats were comfortable, but there is not a lot of space and if the passenger in front you reclines their seat it is not really possible for eat your meal as the tray-table will be too close to you. The in-flight announcements were very frequent and sometimes disturbing. They were also very loud compared to the in-flight entertainment and they were often startling and uncomfortable to listen to. This flight left at 5pm local time and arrived at 12pm in Dublin (so was overnight). Unfortunately the first meal was not served until 4 hours into the flight and so I was very hungry by then (it being 9pm departure time). Additionally, I would have expected more than one meal on a flight of 11-12 hours, as has been my experience on other airlines (British Airways, Lufthansa). The seatbelt sign was frequently left on for hours at a time for seemingly no reason, but it was not enforced by the cabin-crew, which left me confused as to its purpose. The flight from DUB-LHR was on time and the cabin-crew were polite and friendly.

### "Good value for traveling"
This is a review of two connecting flights through Dublin. The first flight from Zürich to Dublin on an Airbus 320 was truly bare bones in terms of in-flight service. No complimentary snacks or drinks (not even water) and no in-flight entertainment of any sort. Duty free items were available for sale but the choices were very limited. Cockpit announcements traced the flight route. The flight from Dublin to New York JFK left on time and arrived at the gate in Terminal 5 over 30 minutes ahead of schedule. With immigration and customs checks for the U.S. having been done at Dublin - I just disembarked out of the plane and walked out of the airport as if it was a domestic flight. No duty free shopping is available on U.S. bound flights from Dublin as customs clearance is done by U.S. Customs in Dublin itself. On this flight a full dinner was served with choice of a beef or chicken - no vegetarian - option. Soft drinks, tea and coffee are complimentary but not beer, liquor or wine. A small but decent selection of movies was available on the individual back of the seat entertainment system. - I was able to watch two movies on this relatively short flight of less than seven hours. Flight attendants were friendly. Too many announcements, even for a fleeting turbulence, was annoying and interruptive. Leg space was tight and when seats were reclined it was a challenge to watch a movie, read a book or eat your meal. Good value for traveling from Zürich to New York though, obviously, it took much longer.

### "quick and efficient"
Dublin to Gatwick was quick and efficient. I arrived at Dublin airport and put my bag on the scales / bag-drop. I needed to check-in my baggage. This was a simple self-service process. I then made my way to the bar and waited to board. The flight was busy the seat 1F was fine. A little tight but good for economy class. The staff were good and I had a nice guinness pie for the short flight. We arrived in London on time. The baggage didn't take too long to collect and I made my way to the train which was quick and only two stops into Clapham Junction. Overall a quick and easy way to London and less busy than Heathrow.

### "refused to refund additional fees"
Los Angeles to Dublin. We initially booked economy round trip for 2 and added assigned seats, baggage fees, upgraded meals and lounge access. The added fees for seats, bags, meals and lounge totaled $551. During the online booking a passenger middle name was place into the last name field, Aer Lingus charged $157 to correct it. We subsequently self upgraded to Business Class which includes normally includes everything we paid additional fees for. Aer Lingus refused to refund the additional fees, stating that was their policy. Also the outbound flight was delayed over 3 hours and my bag was lost on the return trip and took 1 week for it to be delivered even though my name and phone number and address were on my bag. Telephone customer service is almost non-existent, everything has to be processed through their web site. In flight service and comfort good is but before and after the flight is terrible.

### "they lost my suitcase"
Not Verified |  Amsterdam to Hartford via Dublin. Flying business class and they lost my suitcase. Claiming your suitcase and contacting the missing baggage department is handled somewhere in India (call center). Total not capable people who answering like robots. Compensation, never heard of and irritation to the top on my side. Cheap, amateurish and no service at all when you want to find out where your suitcase is when you call, sent mails etc. I want to have compensation for my ruined one week stay in the USA.

### "departure has been delayed"
Aberdeen to Dublin. Having flown multiple times on Dublin > Aberdeen route in the last months, on at least 60% occasions the departure has been delayed. Not sure how such praise has been given when from my experience the stated departure / arrival times do follow the stated times.

### "Would definitely recommend"
Not Verified |  London to New York via Shannon. Great airline! Would definitely recommend to family/friends, the cabin crew took great care of us. Unfortunately I have a nut allergy, the cabin crew on board made our day when the she went into her own supply of food and gave me her sandwich and cake bar, because I couldn't be sure if i could have the food on-board. The recline in the seat was great, comfy and fitting to my figure. The IFE wasn't the best but had a great selection of movies. Highly recommend.

### "they are my favorite airline"
Philadelphia to Dublin. The staff in PHL gave us each a water bottle as we boarded. Even though the plane was 20 years old, every seat had an IFE screen and USB plug. There was no power socket or WiFi. The IFE had many hours of entertainment. The only problem was when the earbuds were plugged in, it only played through one bud. I had to push it in with one hand the whole time. The food was the best. It was simple Irish beef stew, but it was some of the best food I’ve eaten. Flight Attendants were the best crew I’ve ever experienced. We landed in Dublin an hour early at 4:45AM. Over all, they are my favorite airline.

### "how helpful they were"
Not Verified |  Dublin to Boston. I had a very stressful experience as when I got up to the counter to check in the lady informed me that my esta had been deleted by the American embassy. I was already running late so the lady told me to go to the side and get a new esta. I was so panicked as I really didn’t have the money to book a later flight and then the supervisor came over I can’t remember her name and I explained my situation and she could see how upset and worried I was so she called a girl over to help me. The lady who came over to help me had the patience of a saint she practically did the whole esta for me she couldn’t be more helpful! We finally got my esta done and the supervisor brought me through fast track so I made my flight. I can’t thank the Aer Lingus staff enough on how helpful they were with me really really nice people.

### "shocked at his attitude"
Dublin to Gatwick. I have a shoulder injury and find it difficult to put even a lightweight bag up into the overhead locker. I asked a young male cabin crew member to assist me and he refused. Furthermore he told be he had a back problems which I am surprised he shared and in an "I dont want to help you" way. I responded - Ok I will wait for assistance and he just walked away. Another passenger when asked kindly helped me. I was shocked at his attitude to customer service and lack of concern or interest. I will not be choosing this airline again.

### "I was very disappointed in them"
Flew Dublin to Malaga. This was my first time flying Aer Lingus, and I was very disappointed in them. They don’t even offer complimentary water during the flight, I can understand paying for drinks alcoholic or non-alcoholic, and food but water, a necessity to life. We all know flying dehydrates you so not to offer free water, well I don’t think much of this airline. I am a world frequent traveler and never have I seen this.

### "a terrible disappointment"
Berlin to Toronto via Dublin. What a terrible disappointment. The layover in Dublin was deliberately scheduled so as to make it impossible to get to the connecting flight in time, given the way shuttle buses and passport control operate there. The only reason I (and many other passengers) didn't miss our connecting flight was that an airport staff member escorted us past the regular line. Then Aer Lingus lost my bag. I won't even go into the long bureaucratic back-and-forth I had to engage in to get it. Most importantly, I was informed at the airport that I could buy some necessities and Aer Lingus would reimburse me. I did (spending a mere 35 dollars on clothes and a toiletries) and submitted my reimbursement claim through their website. They acknowledged receipt and said they would transfer reimburse me. That was over three months ago. The only message I from them since then, despite repeated attempts to contact them, was that they supposedly couldn't transfer the money to my Canadian bank account. (I live in Germany and don't have a Canadian bank account. I have indicated my account details in ev ery communication.) Since then, they have not responded to any of my messages, or transferred the money. I booked a flight with a BA number and didn't know it would be operated by Aer Lingus at first. From now I will make sure never to fly with them again.

### "crew tired and disinterested"
Dublin to Heathrow. Firstly, I booked my ticket via a travel agent and later found out the price I paid the agency was not for all I needed. I had to use the Aer Lingus website and then pay extra online for my luggage and preferred seat. I was not at all impressed with this side of things. I am a frequent flyer with 2 major airlines both of whom are supposedly partners of Aer Lingus. Whenever I have used EI on this route I do not receive my frequent flyer points and this is a major cause for me to not use them in the future. I was able to check-in online in advance of the flight. Bag drop was efficient but there were no uniformed staff around to help at all. There were elderly people and a non-English speaking family struggling to use the automated bag drop. I assisted 2 elderly people. This is not good enough. Boarding was not well organised at all and no announcement was made with regards to making a queue and / or the boarding order. Passengers were allowed far too much hand luggage and there was no consistency in how this was managed alas. The cabin crew failed to assist an older lady with her bag with regards to accessing an overhead locker. Announcements from the captain were robotic and the crew seemed to be rather tired and disinterested. I had one empty seat next to me and an otherwise very full flight and the window seat was occupied by a passenger clearly under the influence of alcohol. To my astonishment the cabin crew sold this person more alcohol during the flight! Landing was efficient and disembarkation slow and chaotic as luggage had been dispersed all over the plane by passengers with too much luggage. I am not at all pleased with Aer Lingus on this occasion and think they should be far more diligent and responsible than was the case on this occasion. I shall add that the hidden prices and inability of this airline to process my frequent flyer programme have put me off booking my next trip with them. A once proud national carrier should do better.

### "baggage not loaded on to my flight"
Flew on the Aer Lingus flight EI37 from Heathrow to Belfast. Boarding in orderly as was the service onboard. We were a little delayed in leaving London due to ATC and landed on Belfast just before 21:00pm. Can't say too much about Aer Lingus other that you get what you pay for. However, for the 2nd time in just over 6 weeks I again was left in Belfast without my baggage as it was not loaded on to my flight. I went to the lost Baggage counter and spoke with a lady who was totally disinterested in my plight and mechanically went through the process of filling out the forms. There is no one from Aer Lingus at the airport that you can speak with and calling the numbers that the lost baggage lady provided me even though the number is a Republic of Ireland number you are transferred through to a call center in India. I eventually got my Baggage the next day at 16:35pm without any apology from Aer Lingus, need less to say I will not be traveling Aer Lingus anytime soon.

### "not the service I pay for"
I was refused entrance to the Heathrow lounge despite being a full flex fare traveler, in possession of lounge invitation and being a silver aerclub member. The Aer Lingus staff on the desk refused entrance because I didn’t have a plastic aerclub card and refused to either look it up my aerclub and booking details on the system, despite the aerclub member number being clearly printed on boarding pass etc . After 20 minutes arguing with you staff I got in. But this is not the service I pay a premium fare for.

### "late arrival by 3 hours"
Newcastle to Chicago via Dublin. Late boarding and late arrival by 3 hours, two excuses by the pilot (First Officer delayed by a car accident and a technical inspection of aircraft - so which was it?). Another delay coming home from Chicago. Lost baggage in Sept 2017. Won't use them again. Last three trips we've had issues.

### "Charge for everything"
I have flown Aer Lingus 6 times this month after deciding to take advantage of their non-stop flight from Hartford to Dublin. The convenience is great, and Dublin is an ideal airport for connections. I fly over 150,000 miles per year, and have experienced all of the major airlines. I am shocked to see Aer Lingus highly rated. This airline quality on all 6 of my flights this month was below all of the major airlines and on-par with lower tier airlines like Air Europa. Even though I had a 3 hour layover in Dublin, they lost my luggage. The customer service related to lost luggage was the worst I have seen, and the staff immediately came out and said "don't expect to see your luggage this trip". They could not provide any information, and simply seemed not to care. The seats are extremely uncomfortable on the transatlantic flight. The 757 is old, and the seats extremely hard. It is an extreme problem being a vegetarian on this airline. The vegetarian option is horrible, and I have had the same meal for my flights and snacks. The website is the worst I have used. They do not allow you to change seats online. I broke a rib, and wanted to change to an aisle seat, but this could not be done. I was told to talk to people at the gate, and it could not be done at that point. Frequent Flyer program is horrible. I have flown 6 times across the Atlantic in the psat 2 months, and I am no where near Silver. Their program is much worse than competitors. No drinks, water or coffee are provided on the Inter-Europe flights. Asking for a cup of coffee during the trans Atlantic flight is like asking the flight attendant to move to first class. Service is below the standard on other airlines. Dublin is ideal for transfers. Able to clear customs prior to the trip. No Wifi (even for purchase on long haul flights). Charge for everything (even water and coffee) While I love the convenience, the negatives have me looking again for another airlines.

### "exceeded my expectations"
I was pleasantly surprised by the superb quality and care that Aer Lingus provided to me and my fellow passengers during my flight from Gatwick to Toronto via Dublin. My review is solely based on the longer transatlantic flight from Dublin to Toronto. I appreciated the meals frequency and the amenities provided in the flight. From a complimentary earphone to pillows to snacks and food to the variety of programs in the inflight entertainment (including games and puzzles) to  cleanliness of the plane, Aer Lingus certainly exceeded my expectations. The ground crew in Dublin airport are very attentive and readily helpful. Overall, I was pleasantly surprised by this airline, and will be using them for my future transatlantic bonanzas !

### "Most efficient transfer service"
New York to Amsterdam via Dublin. Most efficient transfer service that I've ever experienced in Dublin - it took 5 minutes to complete the transfer into lounge and then I waited for 1 hour for onward flight to Amsterdam - brilliant. The Dublin transfer is a real option for USA - Europe connections, even when there is a direct route. The lounge in JFK was decent, although a few jaded materials and lack of attention to detail let it down - the lounge is quite new but some of the materials are worn, decal notices peeling, etc. The lounge should be continually touched up. The A330 business class is one of the better business cabins I've experienced but again it needs a deep clean. IFE is very good and user friendly but would benefit from a greater movie selection. In flight WiFi connection was best I've experienced, it actually worked and was fast unlike most other airlines. Dublin transfer was excellent as summarised. A320 connection to Amsterdam was good, no business class cabin but decent seat in front of aircraft and efficient in flight service/friendly staff - for a business class connection, however, I think you shouldn't have to pay for refreshments but not a big criticism. All in all a very good experience and only criticism is that the JFK lounge and A330 could benefit from a deep clean as they look more jaded than their age should reflect.

### "was a booking error"
Dublin to Boston. There was a booking error on our return trip. Customer representative charged 4 of us more than double the original round-trip price for the return change, telling us that this was the best we would get, take it now or leave now. We took it, and upon checking, we could have saved on Aer Lingus if we had left the return as it was and just booked a separate flight. In my over 55 years of flying different airlines, I have never been treated so unfairly.

### "abandoning their passengers"
Dublin to Dusseldorf. Weather was bad. Checked on Flightaware and Aer Lingus website. Both said plane was on time for 5:30pm Departure. At 6:15 were told departure 6:45. Started boarding plane. At 7pm flight was cancelled when half of passengers had already boarded aircraft. Communication after that was atrocious. Not sure whether flight was cancelled due to crew working hours limit. Passengers spoke individually to Gate Staff and asked them to communicate over the intercom to the whole group which they wouldn't do. No written communication was given. Issues which had to be resolved without any guidance from Aer Lingus were a) How to rebook to a later flight (24 hours later earliest available) b) How to exit airport as we had passed through passport control c) Where to get our bags d) Accomodation options e) Compensation options according to EU law No food vouchers or accomodation vouchers were given. Tried to ring Aer Lingus at 3am hoping it would be quiet. Was put on hold for 30 mins with no indication of when call would be answered. Filled in a complaint form on their website. Response was "A member of our Guest Relations team will review your request and personally reply to you within the next 60 business days" That's almost 3 months. Aer Lingus has to do some serious work in the customer relations area if they don't want to go out of business. As this would be a semi regular occurence it would have been helpful to get a handout showing what to do and covering a-e above. A good airline is one that handles the situation rather than abandoning their passengers when a flight is cancelled

### "did not provide solutions"
Amsterdam to Miami via Dublin. Due to the storm our flight was delayed several hours. My friend and I had a travel time over 30 hours. The Aer Lingus Customer Service Desk had only 1 person behind the counter when the incident happened and other 5-6 counters were empty for several hours. The managers told us that the Customer Service desk will be closed at 8pm, and there was nothing Aer Lingus can do at the moment. It would appear to have been more helpful if the managers took charge and provided a solution, looked for solutions, or provided some helpful constructive customer service. We were given breakfast tickets and were later told that the breakfast ticket was unusable in other venues and only usable by the cafe, which claimed to open 24 hours but didn’t have any food for us and Aer Lingus had closed already. So we also used our own money later to buy snacks. Then we found out that there was a difference between a meal ticket (which was apparently able to be used at any restaurant/supermarket in the airport) and a breakfast ticket (which was only to be used at the cafe). Since we connected the flight from Amsterdam to Dublin early AM, the entire day we were with Aer Lingus. Nothing was done, every response from our were questions were brushed off with unhelpful response. I believe this airline failed to remember the fact the only food they provided was a pack of cookies, therefore we couldn’t use the tickets and was given only 1 pack of water. I would like to highlight that this complaint is to the fact that Aer Lingus did not provide solutions nor notify us of the differences between the 2 tickets. I do not think I will ever fly with this airline again, I understand that weather conditions affected the flight patterns and caused delay but the customer service was horrible. The employees behind the ticketing booths and the managers were all very rude and accepted no responsibilities.

### "Never fly them again"
Our Aer Lingus flight from Ireland to Boston was cancelled due to "technical issues. They re-scheduled our flight to go from Ireland to New York JFK airport and then another flight to Boston airport. Due to the longer flight, we missed our connecting flight home to Denver. Now its 8pm and no flights out until 9am the next morning. My wife has bronchitis and a horrible cough. I asked them to help us with a hotel for the night and they said, "There is nothing we can do. Cheapest hotel is $400/night. So, now my poor wife is sleeping the night in a chair at Boston airport! They are very willing to take your money but not willing to take responsibility when they blow it. They were completely responsible for us missing our connecting flight home. Heartless airline company. Never fly them again and I would highly suggest you consider your choices. Aer Lingus is horrible.

### "not travel Aer Lingus again"
Not Verified |  Glasgow to Dublin. The check in and flight itself was good. On time and reasonable. I am a cyclist and scientist and traveling for conference and training. I booked and paid for a bicycle. However, on return my bicycle carry box was damaged externally. I have had no offer of acceptance/not of liability, letter etc. When home (Glasgow), the bike frame had be damaged, which would have required a heavy force e.g. dropped form back of plane, heavy baggage dumped on top etc. The frame was unridable and needed replacing. I fly about 40 flights a year and have done for over 5 years with bike in this format with zero issues (mainly Air New Zealand and other Star Alliance carriers). OK. so occasionally some handling error may occur, this is life. However, I called, wrote, filled out online forms as recommended by AerLIngus. Replies were short and noted "please wait out team is reviewing it". I followed up 9 times over 2 months and still no response. I have now moved to my travel insurer for recovery of damage costs. Aer Lingus' baggage-ralated customer services is appalling 0.5 out of 10. It left a very sour taste and I would not travel Aer Lingus again nor can recommend this airline. If you do value your baggage and must travel with this poor airline, ensure you have it fully insured. reading other comments here, the airline has a baggage handling issue to sort out. Cheers.

### "Never flying with them again"
Not Verified |  Terrible customer service, rude and unhelpful. Flew Dublin to New York (Aer Lingus) and New York onto Las Vegas (jetblue) on 2 July. Bags never left Dublin until the 10 July and never received any bag for entire holiday. Supposedly bag arrived in Las Vegas sometime after this. On return to Dublin tried to trace bag whereabouts and was told by Aer Lingus that despite their mistake they would take no responsibility for the bag or helping find it and that it was jet blues issue, in saying this they were incredibly rude and unhelpful. Jet blue have then said they returned the bag from Las Vegas to Aer Lingus and said contact them to return it to Ireland. Now Aer Lingus refuse to say anything other then contact jetblue, but jetblue saying Aer Lingus have the bag! This is going on for 2 months and the time and money gone into trying to get bag back, nothing about the ruined holiday or the cost of additional clothing on holiday. At least jetblue try to help and have good customer service. Aer Lingus are just so rude and unhelpful and it was their mistake! Never flying with them again.

### "staff handled it very poorly"
Chicago to Amsterdam via Dublin. My flight was cancelled and staff handled it very poorly, no one received anything. They gave us a sheet of paper with the wrong number/number that didn't exist. After asking around and searching their website we had to call a phone line that took 4+ hours to talk to someone and had a choice between rescheduling the next flight with them which was two days out or refund of the cancelled flight which means you have to pay expensive last minute flights with other airlines.

### "overall great airline"
Not Verified |  Dublin to London Heathrow. Overall great airline. Self Check in a bit laggy, needed assistance from staff, handled it great. Staff great, legroom average but seats very comfortable. We were on time for our return flight and this. Good job Aer Lingus.

### "totally disappointed"
Flew on the EI037 August 16th from Heathrow to Belfast. Boarding Process was reasonable and flight itself was ok, however after arriving in Belfast on schedule I spent 25 minutes waiting for my baggage, which never arrived. I went to the lost baggage counter where I met a person who did not care about my situation and went through the mechanical motions of giving me the registering forms. I then had to log on to a website to follow up on where by baggage was. I finally got data on line that my bag would be arriving in Belfast midday August 17th, however I did not get any calls or e-mails from Aer Lingus updating me on the status of my baggage. I eventually received my baggage on August 18th @12:40am. Totally disappointed in Aer Lingus service and follow to advise the status of the lost baggage.

### "seats were unacceptably tight"
Toronto to Dublin. On both legs of this roundtrip flight (a journey I am very familiar with), the seats were unacceptably tight. I am 6'3". It is a health hazard to cram patrons in substandard seating. With my knees jammed against the seat in front of me and not even an inch to squirm around, I and every taller patron  is at risk of injury.

### "website is a disaster"
London to Cork. The flight service is reasonable for the money, they charge for everything, bags ,meals and all seats with charges depends on the class. But the booking through the airline website is a disaster, I booked my flight online where for 1st time after completing the booking process including the payment the the window took long time look like loading or processing and surprisingly the window back to where all the flight details again and I have to start all over again. I waited 10-15 mins when I did not receive any confirmation email as well as I have created account where it did not show any booked trip, so I went back and booked my flight which is urgent and I needed to confirm the booking for my company. When I received the bank statement I found out they charge me twice where there is only receipt of one flight and one person. Calling the customer service did not help as nothing in their system Proof this duplicate payment so I have to fill the online form for refund where the only proof is the bank statement that is made me look like i took advantage of the company money and the investigation in the airline in the email said they may take up 60 days! What kind of poor service is this

### "worst place for a transfer"
Dublin to Chicago. Worst airline/transfer experience to date. On the way back from World Cup Moscow I connected in Dublin for Aer Lingus flight 125 back to Chicago. It took nearly 3.5 hours to navigate Dublin airport from my arriving Finnair flight (1381) in Terminal 1 my to the departing Aer Lingus flight in terminal 2. Upon arriving in Terminal 1 you're directed out through security/customs to the street, a quick 3 minute walk outside to terminal 2. Ensuing 90 minute wait for a ticket agent as the kiosks weren't working. Then security again to enter terminal 2. Then security again in terminal 2, then customs. None of which is an issue caused by Aer Lingus, just terrible airport design and the worst place for a transfer I've ever encountered. We boarded the plane parked at the gate, A330-300 a newer plane by Aer Lingus standards (equipped with USB charger at each seat at least). At the end of the boarding process we were told to deplane as our aircraft was going to be sent to Boston instead. After a nearly 2 hour delay we reboarded a older A330-200 (the equipment normally assigned to the route). No USB, no working power, no working video and my seat pocket was held together with peel & stick velcro. Needless to say everyone missed their connecting flights in Chicago. I'm assuming some algorithm decided in was more cost effective to put those 4 extra rows to use in Boston than Chicago. In all, flight crew adequate, food below average, equipment extremely old. Pathetic management. First and last experience with Aer Lingus.

### "does not leave on time"
Knock to Gatwick. I am just onboard my very late return to London. I dread the flights as it does not leave on time. This is a budget airline charging a premium. This set of flights cost over £400. Ryanair cost half but for me fly into the wrong airport. I was kind of hoping the cost would mean quality but no. Far from it.

### "Staff would not help"
Dublin to Orlando. Everything was fine with the flight except the lady in front of my husband decided to put her seat back and refused to move it, even when he was served his snack. Staff would not help. Did not ask her to sit upright until the very last minute before we landed, even though everyone else had been asked to do this half an hour before in preparation for landing. You get what you pay for and next time we will pay for Virgin. It is worth it!

### "Terrible customer service"
Terrible customer service. I needed to make some last minute changes to my itinerary. I was given a quotation for the changes which Aer Lingus later advised was given in error but they refused to honour. I had to pay nearly 3 times the original quotation. They also made errors on the amount they charged my credit in Euros and have so far refused to resolve the issue. The flights themselves were uneventful but disappointing. The planes were old but had maybe been refitted with new seats in recent years. The inflight entertainment is basic and I found it hardly worth watching. My USB charger point did not work and only one earphone worked. I ordered 2 kids meals and 2 gluten free meals 48 hrs in advance and did not receive any of them. The final insult was having to pay for alcoholic beverages on the flights.

### "Service was wonderful, personal"
London to San Francisco via Dublin. Once boarded on the long flight to SFO, things were great - even got a few hours sleep so i arrived home feeling good and had hardly any jet lag, even with daylight all the way over from Europe. The lounges could be better, even BA's Terraces has champagne on request and several hot dishes. It's weird flying in very basic coach from London to Dublin, where they wanted to charge even for a cup of tea - but a kind flight attendant found me a completely empty row so I got to look out the window plus had easy aisle access for that short flight. Service on the long leg was wonderful, personal, friendly and efficient and they had Peaky Blinders on the IFE! It was great to bypass immigration and customs at SFO (having done that at DUB), but someone forgot to open the door to the area where our bags were being delivered, so we lost a fair amount of the time saved.

### "hey lost my luggage"
Not Verified | Zurich to Toronto via Dublin. Both my flights were delayed by over an hour. They lost my luggage - which was only returned days after. Impossible to reach customer services on the phone to track this luggage. Customers have to pay for meals on European trips. Vegetarian snack was just a tub of salad and a tub of fruit.

### "my flight was cancelled!"
Hartford to Dublin, I booked this August 2018 flight for my honeymoon back in December. When I went to go through my itinerary for my entire trip one last time my flight was cancelled! I received no notice of this I had already been charged and my fiancé and I spent over 10  hours on hold starting Friday afternoon and did not get in touch with someone until Sunday morning who said no one could help us over the phone it had to be done through email! At this point we were in a straight panic and had to rebook so now we have paid twice for our honeymoon and frankly are too frustrated to even be excited about it. Still have not received any response from numerous emails sent and numerous claims submitted through their website. Not to mention I booked directly with Aer Lingus thinking that would put in the most secure position for my honeymoon travel plans!! !

### "United Airlines ruined the plans"
Not Verified | Booked 12 tickets for my family to go to my daughter's wedding. After a flight cancellation on the last 10 travelers and later flight delay on United, our Aer Lingus flight was missed. (Aer Lingus booked the first 7 tickets but said they were out of seats on the United flight, so they had me book the last 5 directly.) 4 Tickets were rebooked on United but since Aer Lingus refused to release the tickets for the last 5 travelers, they were left in Newark. Had to purchase new tickets on Norwegian the next day. Aer Lingus left a family with a special needs child at the airport and refused to help. Customer service was non existent, wouldn't provide a person to talk to and said the only recourse was to file a complaint on line. The answer to the complaint was United Airlines ruined the plans, but Aer Lingus is not responsible.

### "punctuality is horrendous"
Dublin to Amsterdam. The aircraft and service is okayish for short haul, although all quite dated. However, Aer Lingus punctuality is horrendous. The last two months, none of my Aer Lingus flights were on time, always delayed 45+ minutes. As a frequent business traveler, I would rather avoid this airline and pick someone else where you can, otherwise you'll be arriving late almost guaranteed.

### "never fly this airline again"
Los Angeles to Dublin. Made a reservation and bought an exit row seat for $70. A few days before my outbound flight I checked my flight details and found that they had changed my seat to a regular seat. I called and got it changed back. On the day I left they changed it to a regular seat again and I had to fight to get my exit row $70 seat back. Crooked behavior! Then at check in they refused to check my back through from Dublin to Leeds on an Aer Lingus flight because, I bought the ticket from Expedia? They told me if I wanted the convenience of checking bags through I had to buy the ticket directly from them. They do not participate in the TSA or Global Entry programs so I waited 1 hour 23 minutes in security at LAX which is always absolute chaos in terminal 2. In flight crew were at best indifferent and mostly just rude. One very small meal two hours after takeoff then not even a snack for 10 hours. Wine outrageously expensive and water was not offered once for 10 hours. When I went back to the galley to ask for water the curtain was drawn so no passengers welcome! Arrival was chaotic (jetway was wrongly placed). I would never fly this airline again. They said that the $70 seat got me priority boarding and at the gate they told me, no you wait till your row is called! Today I was supposed to fly from Leeds to Dublin and then from Dublin back to LA the Dublin flight so far is delayed over 5 hours. I have been waiting 2 hours to even talk to someone about getting rebooked but no one available and again, they refused to check my bag through to LA because I booked the Leeds to Dublin flight through Expedia even though both my flights are on Aer Lingus. Absolute chaos with delay, no one has a clue what to do. Avoid this mickey mouse airline at all costs. Not only are they horribly inefficient but their personnel are either very rude or worse, indifferent.

### "Staff were useless"
I had a terrible experience trying to get on my flight. Staff were useless and gave me wrong the information and were telling me I couldn't get on my flight because they couldn't print my boarding pass, despite confirming that I was checked in on the flight and the flight hadn't even started boarding yet. They sent me to flight reservations to book another flight because they couldn't print a boarding pass. I sensed this was ridiculous and went to another check in desk and they printed it for me then and there immediately. I had lost about 40 minutes hitting brick walls with Aer Lingus staff and the Aer Lingus app and trying to get up to security and back down to check in. It meant I had to run through security and for about 10 minutes to the far end of the terminal to make my flight. I was soaked in sweat and really uncomfortable getting on the flight. It was an example of a catalogue of bad processes and negligent don't care attitude staff. I checked in online and took a screenshot of my boarding pass. I went to the airport for about 1 hour before boarding and tried to print my boarding pass at the terminal. It wouldn't allow me. I went to the Aer Lingus concierge and she said it was odd but the screen shot I have will do. Security couldn't accept the screenshot because it wouldn't scan. I downloaded the Aer Lingus app but it wouldn't give me my boarding pass. I went back to the check in desk and they wandered off to check something and came back to tell me they can't print boarding passes because it's within 45 minutes of the flight. This was incorrect and I finally got someone who knew what they were doing.

### "neither excellent, nor bad"
Flew Dublin to Milan. I have flown with Aer Lingus several times, the result is always the same, neither excellent, nor bad, the crew are always kind, the airplanes are clean (even if a little old), food and drinks on board are paid (crazy for a company so big), the seats are not very comfortable, but the prices are often good and overall I recommend.

### "become my favourite airline"
Toronto to Dublin. I have flown between Canada and Europe with them on three separate occasions now, and frankly they have become my favourite airline. Tickets are always under $700 CAD return (my last ticket cost $540 return!). Planes are modern, clean, and spacious. There is plenty of overhead storage in the cabin unlike many other airlines (they don't bug you about slightly oversized carry-on items either). Meals are average, but not the worst for plane food. They also provide snacks. Staff is friendly. Seats are comfortable and wide with excellent leg room in Economy. Entertainment has standard 3.5mm audio jacks (use your own headphone) The only negative things that I've noticed is that boarding can take forever and sometimes the plane leaves late (for the most part the pilot makes up the time in the air and I've always arrived as scheduled). The in-flight entertainment system also has as limited selection, so I recommend you bring books or load you phone with media. In conclusion, this airline delivers a similar service to other well-renowned European airlines (KLM, Lufthansa, etc) and at a borderline-budget price too! Obviously things can go wrong, just like any other airline, however I urge you to give Aer Lingus a chance. They are by far better than any other airlines that lean towards budget costs.

### "lateness of flights"
Not Verified |  Flew from Dublin to London in late May. The plane was delayed for 45 minutes but caught up 30 minutes and arrived in London 15 minutes late. However we were boarded on time even though they knew that they had no landing slot in London. Very uncomfortable on a hot morning but crew excellent and information updates regular and informing. Flight ok. THe return trip was a disaster. Arrived early to Heathrow and placed on an earlier flight which was constantly being put back and eventually took off 20 minutes after the departure time for our original flight. We had been checked in but couldn't board the plane because the crew had not arrived. Passengers were held standing for about 30 minutes in a very small area. The crew were fussy and over officious and spent alot of their time correcting individual passengers. The intercom communications from flight staff were incomplete as they managed every time to cut themselves off and were totally indistinct. Overall an unexpected horrendous experience as previous flights with Aer Lingus had been consistently good. Probably will be slow to fly with them again due to consistent lateness of flights and staff issues.

### "pros are not worth the hassle"
Seattle to Birmingham via Dublin. This was my first time flying through this airline. The transatlantic flight from Seattle to Dublin was delayed, awfully dirty and the seats wouldn't recline. The staff was impolite. The domestic flight from Dublin to Birmingham was worse; it was delayed and the management was a mess. As I was getting through security, the airline updated the monitors that the flight had left, whereas they hadn't even started boarding. The also lost and damaged my luggage and were always unaccessible whenever I reached out. This flight was cheap and the food (on the transatlantic carrier only) was good but the pros are not worth the hassle. Their organization is a mess and they are unreliable. If you do decide to fly through them, get travel insurance and cover your bases.

### "quality for the price was good"
Seattle to Barcelona via Dublin. The overall quality for the price was good the international flight had good food and surprisingly good entertainment, but where we ran into some major problems was when it came to luggage and flight times. Both flights were quite late by about an hour (SEA to DUB and DUB to Spain) While this is rather common for a cheap airline it is nonetheless annoying, and probably something to be expected from Aer Lingus in the future. The biggest issue and really the reason I even chose to write this review is that they lost our luggage. The only reason we took this flight and the connecting one was because it was exclusively through Aer Lingus and we figured that with a 6 hour layover in Dublin they would have time to move our bags from one plane to the other. This was too much to ask, however, and despite being told they would transfer the bags they did not. (I am speaking for me and my friend) Once in Spain we learned that another passenger that flew from the UK and then connected to Barcelona from Dublin had the exact same issue, however his story was even stupider since he actually happened to see that his luggage had been unloaded and placed in the carousel in Dublin airport. Keep in mind this was just by chance, he grabbed his bag and told the staff that Air Lingus was supposed to have taken care of this and should have put it on the Barcelona bound plane. Despite him correcting this mistake and giving them another chance to fix it, they till forgot his bag in Dublin. That is pure incompetence. So now me and my friend are in Barcelona for a two month long study abroad, havent heard anything from Aer Lingus and have literally one change of clothes and nothing else. Maybe other peoples' experiences are better than ours, but this airline although has some promise of being sub-par, is simply not worth the risk. Spend the extra money, I know I will next time. Side note: legroom was pretty good and me and my friend are both 6'4".

### "crew member hadn't showed up"
Philadelphia to Manchester via Dublin. This was one of the worst flights I have flown. We were unable to check-in online the night before and without i=forming us, we were given seats that didn't recline, for the 8 hr trip. The food was appalling. The return flight wasn't much better. After having the same issue with checking in, I called the airline to try and check in the day before so we wouldn't get stuck with bad seats again, and they informed us that even though we had an Aer Lingus Reference Number they couldn't help us because it was booking through Expedia. After getting to the airport and waiting at the gate, boarding time comes and an announcement is made that the flight is delayed because a crew member hadn't showed up yet. No updates were given, and a supervisor was loud with some of the passengers that were just looking for an update. You would think that Aer Lingus would have back up crew members. Unable to even board the plane, a full flight was waiting on the punctuality of a single crew member. After an hour of waiting the single missing cabin crew member shows up and we can finally board. The plane was freezing cold, I asked for a blanket two times from the flight attendant and never received one. Customer service is appalling, seats uncomfortable, plane was outdated and food disgusting.

### "planes were vintage 1970s"
We flew from Philadelphia to Dublin and on to Heathrow, return. The planes that carried us across the Atlantic (ASL Airlines) were vintage 1970s. My seat arm rest fell off. On the return flight, the seat backs were not attached to the metal frames and the seat cushion had not 'cushion' or springs or whatever makes them comfortable for 7 hours. The toilets smelled like urinals in some very dank Dublin pub - disgusting! The food was not edible. This was the worst airline experience we ever had - and that includes flying in countries that are not considered "first world. In addition, it is impossible to talk with someone at Are Lingus-1 hour and 45 minutes on hold with Irish music was enough to count as torture. Never actually talked to anyone. I even called the Dublin telephone number and got the same hold and music. And they charged for water on the flight from Dublin to Heathrow - Really?

### "changed my seating arrangement"
Toronto to Barcelona via Dublin. Awful first flight with Aer Lingus. It was delayed for an hour and a half, which forced me to lose my connection. On top of that, they changed my seating arrangement without prior notice. I had paid for a seat with extra leg room. When I showed up, I had been moved to another spot with little room for a 6’3 guy. Not good for my knees or hips.

### "Appalling customer service"
❎ Not Verified |  Dublin to Chicago. Appalling customer service. Due to airline delay by 2 hrs we ran into a storm in Chicago which forced the plane to divert to MKE. Then proceeded to be held on the tarmac for more than 5 hours under the pretense of refueling. After refueling was complete the flight crew had run over duty hours. We then could not go on to Chicago. However, that decision was only made after many hours on the tarmac, even though it was quite obvious that by the time we were refueled the flight crew would be over hours. This led us to get to the baggage area around 2AM. There was no support staff to talk about further plans. We were told the airline would contact us. I was forced to find an alternative route to Chicago. However, I received no communication from the airline after this disaster. After waiting for approx 48 hrs I made multiple calls to the airline, receiving incompetent support staff answers. Still have not heard from the airline after this disaster.

### "plagued with operational issues"
Orlando to Dublin. Flew Aer Lingus from Birmingham to New York via Dublin. Delays out, more delays on our return by as much as up to 3 hours. We also had prepaid exit row seats with additional legroom and due to a problem with a change in aircraft we were moved from these seats to standard economy so I’m now chasing for a refund. A 3 hour connection back in Dublin on our return turned into a 5 minute race to our transfer flight. This airline seems to be plagued with operational issues, faulty aircraft which are causing these delays. Food was ok but you have to pay for alcoholic drinks! Even though we paid full whack for our trip to the states. First time flying and possibly the last even though they advertised clearing immigration faster you actually end up spending more time waiting for the plane to take off! You could have cleared immigration twice with their delays!

### "this is the worst experience"
Dublin to Chicago. I was one of the unfortunate customers that was on the EI125 flight May 2nd. We were diverted to Milwaukee due to thunder storms in Chicago and the Captain and crew tried to keep us informed as much as they could. We sat on the runway in Milwaukee for 3 hrs waiting for the storm to pass but at that stage the crew could not fly it to Chicago so the deplaned us and we were told we would be looked after in the Terminal. When we got in there was one gentleman telling us they were printing forms with our options and he was going to collect the rest of the people off the flight. We never saw him again of Aer Lingus staff. We were left in the terminal to sort out our own arrangements. I have been trying since yesterday to find my bag that was on that flight. I have been flying Aer Lingus for years and this is the worst experience I have had -  over 200 people in a terminal and not one Aer Lingus person to take care of them?

### "Guest Relations a disaster"
Hamburg to Dublin. No Priority Boarding service offered - Guest Relations a disaster. Having paid priority boarding fees for our group of four, the service was not offered at the boarding gate. When questioned, the sole Aer Lingus agent on duty shrugged and claimed that the microphone on the adjoining desk was broken and so was unable to make the announcement - not sure of the relevance of his comment as he was able to use his own microphone to call a very full flight - very much a case of put up with it. On boarding, I mentioned it to the cabin supervisor who advised that she would include it in her flight report. I filed a complaint and a refund request with the euphemistically/optimistically named "Guest Relations" dept on 31/3, and followed up on 11/4 and again on 23/4 and have been assured "that we will do all we can to address your request" plus the promise of a personal reply within 30 working days! Presumably the interest on our priority fees and those paid by other passengers on the flight, is compounding nicely in Aer Lingus  favour. Kindly get on with it  and process.

### "an online bid to upgrade"
We flew from New York to Dublin and then from Shannon to New York. We made an online bid to upgrade our original economy class tickets to business, and successfully purchased them for a very reasonable price. A newish A330 on the outbound leg, with very comfortable lay-flat seats and impeccable service with perfect menu selections of both food and drinks. Very smooth flight too. The only complaint is that they limit your complimentary WiFi to only 400MB of traffic, and it was excruciatingly slow at times. The flight from Shannon to JFK was a complete opposite, and it really felt like we were flying a third-world airline. For some reason, Aer Lingus chooses to fly 20 year old 757-200's on this route that clearly show their age both inside and out. We were delayed departing out of SNN for about 50 minutes although this is not a very busy airport, and there was departure hold. About 1.5 hour into the flight we hit a patch of very rough air, and spent some very uncomfortable moments wondering if this old bird would make it through. The rest of the flight was smooth. Out of three lavatories in Economy, only two were operational, and boy, did they reek of urine! The seats were old-style Recaro and not too uncomfortable with decent leg room. My family's three seat backs had trouble staying up, and there was no WiFi available. On the positive note: the food in Economy was very good with decent-sized portions. Alcoholic beverages were available for purchase.

### "cabin staff were extremely professional"
Flew Aer Lingus from DUB-CDG and return 22 March - 26 March 2018 with a 60-strong school group. Outbound flight was hassle-free, checkin was fast and fluid with staff dealing with flights for all over Europe and North America. Bags were checked in free of charge. Though, slightly fed up at this stage of having to proceed to a T1 departure gate after checking in at T2. One of our party was quite ill on the way out and the cabin staff were extremely professional, calming and reassuring. Flight landed 15 minutes ahead of schedule. Inbound, CDG-DUB was somewhat less hassle-free. Not sure who AL’s agents are at CDG but Check-in was extremely slow with staff blaming the computer but there was no sense of urgency even thereafter. A trainee then arrived to take over from a more senior agent which slowed things further. On the plus side, bags were again taken free of charge. In the end, It took well over an hour to check us all in. Flight arrived at DUB 15 minutes ahead of schedule at 22.25 However, this time we pulled up at a T1 gate and had to wait to be bused to T2, delaying our ultimate arrival home further. T2 was opened in 2007 and I just don’t understand this practice of then having to go back to T1 for the flight.

### "appreciate being treated well"
The flight crew was professional, the flight also left on time. The seats were a bit cramped, however the in-flight amenities more than made up for this. The food service was on point, I opted for the Shepard's Pie, which was quite tasty and chocolate mousse for dessert was outstanding. My only complaint was the price of the beverage service. I felt that at least one round of drinks should be complimentary for an international flight. In flight entertainment was satisfactory, with an engaging selection of movies. I did not purchase in-flight WiFi access. It was in the range of about 35 Euro (or somewhere thereabouts), which I think is ridiculous for less than 6 hours of internet access. I am giving the ground service an average rating. The announcements were difficult to hear, as the gate agent seemed to be whispering into the microphone. The gate agents also called people to the desk at random, which can make one nervous about being "bumped" from the flight. If you are going to call individuals to the counter at the gate, at least announce the reason, then request the names. This would give all of those waiting some more peace of mind. Also, I purchased Aer Lingus club passes during on-line check-in the night before. Apparently, our club passes for JFK were not processed due to the lounge being full, according to the agent there. It would have been nice if Aer Lingus had posted at least a note of caution on their website, that if the lounge is full, passes will not be honored. At least my credit card was not charged for this. The agent operating the lounge could have also used a lesson in professionalism. So, I have good news and bad news. Let's start with the bad news: Gate agents who needed additional training. Lounge pass policies which were not made clear, and in-flight beverage service which needs some help. I appreciate being treated well, especially as an Economy Class passenger.

### "No sense of urgency"
We checked in at the airport in Edinburgh to no line and the attendant at the counter checked our bags. We were not asked if we wanted the bags checked through to IAD and the flight was the next day at 12.55. The previous flight EI3255 was just landing at Dublin. We had no bags, but because we were staying the night, we had a reservation at the Radisson. We have been sitting in the Dublin airport for 2.5 hours so they could find our bags. This is terribly inconvenient and I will go out of my way not to fly this airline again. No sense of urgency.

### "Would fly Aer Lingus again"
Shannon to London. Fantastic service on my flight, Cabin crew were welcoming and smiling. Seats were comfortable and plenty of leg room. Captain gave frequent announcements which were nice to hear. Boarding in Shannon was very smooth and once landed, I was off the plane and on the tube in under 10 minutes! The new terminal 2 at Heathrow is great. Would fly Aer Lingus again.

### "no idea what we were to do"
Overall, my experience using Aer Lingus airlines was very disappointing. I flew from New York JFK to Dublin with little problems. We were able to check in on time and fly on time. The leg room was much less roomier than most other planes I’ve flown on and the seats were not comfortable. However we did depart and arrive without any problems. The problems occurred when our flight from Dublin to New York JFK was canceled due to a snow storm. I totally understand why the flight was canceled and am fine with that. What upsets me is that I called Aer Lingus at various times throughout the day, being on hold for about an hour each time, and when I called Aer Lingus customer service would tell me there was nothing they could do each time. Aer Lingus customer service said to go to the airport and wait until they put us on a flight. Aer Lingus closes at night until 9am eastern standard time when they were unable to get us on a plane because they were not open for phone calls. I do not understand how an airline closes customer service for phone calls in general, but especially when they cancel a flight late at night leaving passengers with no sense of when they are arriving home. In Ireland, the time is 1300 hours, at 0900 hours eastern standard time, which means we were kicked out of our hotel with no idea what we were to do. Luckily after finding an outside source from a travel agent, we were able to get a flight to Connecticut, on Friday (we were originally leaving Wednesday), which then we had to drive 3 hours to New York. Without contacting this outside source we would most likely still not have any flight home. We had to pay for two more nights for hotels, which I understand there was a storm and flights were canceled, however Aer Lingus would still not have us on a flight. Aer Lingus never emailed us or called us one to let us know the status of the plane, we had to call each and every time. Besides being upset about the customer service telling us they couldn’t help us and closing until 9am, we were very upset with the staff at Aer Lingus airport in Dublin. We went to a Aer Lingus desk to ask a question about where the lounge was and the lady behind the desk said she couldn’t help us because we were not at her gate. This was a simple question of where something was as anyone who worked in the airport could help us, but this lady who worked for Aer Lingus could not spend one second to even point in a direction. The gate she was at was not boarding and no one was on any type of line to speak to her. Overall, I am very upset with Aer Lingus, and do not have any plans in the future to use their services.

### "worst customer service"
Orlando to Dublin. They cancelled our return flight home and left us stranded for 5 extra nights. Directed us to their website which didn’t work. Spent over 6 hours on the phone and got “disconnected” over 12 tines. Was directed to go to the airport and they sent us away. The worst customer service imaginable. They are only after their bottom line and could care less about people.

### "Good experience with Aer Lingus"
Good experience with Aer Lingus from Dublin to Miami. We treated ourselves to business class on the way back. Both flights were on time, I booked a seat with extra leg room but that wasn't such a benefit. You have to be a size zero model to squeeze into the seats as they are narrower in the emergency aisles. Fortunately I was able to swap into an ordinary economy seat. The way back was great, comfortable seat, entertainment, and the food was excellent. We managed to catch a few hours sleep. It was a nightmare going through Miami security took over an hour, chaotic and poorly organised. What a contrast with the flight from Dublin, 10 minutes and we were through even though my wife was marked down for special security

### "Very bad experience"
The flight from Dublin to Lyon was rescheduled from Friday to Saturday due to bad weather conditions. On Saturday we had to leave at 11.40 in the morning. We waited 9 hours in the airport and in the end our flight was deleted without any reason. At the airport there wasn't the snow anymore and lot of flights left during the day without any problems, including Aer Lingus flights. I'm asking for compensation but I can't for bad weather conditions as this is not true. The assistance was very bad at the airport. Very bad experience.

### "cancelled flights for no reason"
Dublin to Hamburg. There is nothing wrong with the crew or aircraft but the airline itself is now terrible. A frequent flyer club that doesn’t work, customer service email never replied to, and cancelled flights for no reason. The pilot was sick, a major airline with no back up crew?

### "needs to read this feedback"
Dublin to Faro. I booked a family break at a fairly ok price back in 2017. Punctual on both legs with a fairly standard service on both outbound and return and nothing out of the ordinary. On the way back the plane still had rubbish from the previous flight that came in from Dublin. We didn't buy anything on board as we are frequent fliers and understand that the prices are too inflated. My biggest issue is the way that Aer Lingus do not make it clear that their policy is to seat families together. They don't tell you this as they want you to book the seats together for 9 euro which is a complete sham and hopefully the Civil Aviation Authority will stop this money making deception. If you wait 30 hours before you fly you can all sit together for no cost as long as you don't mind where it is on the plane, But what if you don't have access to internet for the return flight? For example Faro airport does not accept the e tickets? As I said I booked this flight for a fairly decent price, I didn't buy anything on board and did not book a seat ( by 5 persons return this would have inflated our holiday spending by 90 euro). It was a standard service by an economy airline trying to make a few extra pounds off their customers. I would have been happy to fly with Ryanair on this route but EI was slightly cheaper and the times were good. Aer Lingus needs to read this feedback and stay in touch with the customer base.

### "service experienced was highly frustrating"
I am so disappointed to have to write this review of Aer Lingus. I fly regularly with them 3-4 times per year, but now I will have to reconsider. I had no success in trying to change the date of a return flight, despite availability on the return flight I wished to avail of. I called the company and they refused to do it over the phone. In addition, I tried through their online system which would not permit it. At this point, the service experienced was highly frustrating. Having wrote to "Guest Services, which is their inappropriately branded customer complaint department, they provided me with a three line vague response that didn't correspond to my complaint in any way. I found this experience bordering on arrogant. Having returned an email to them outlining this, they chose not to reply. I tried to engage the company on social media, no reply either. When I had a great experience with Aer Lingus about two years ago, I wrote to the company outlining how grateful that I was. At that time I had backspin and they upgraded my seat to accommodate me. Within hours, I had received two emails from the company about how delighted they were. On this occasion however, there wasn't a word from the company for five days after my email was sent, and the customer services rep on the phone was short and unwilling in any way to help me. I will not fly with Aer Lingus again!

### "flying very old Airbus aircraft"
. This was my second time in two years to fly transatlantic flights with Aer Lingus and it appears they are still flying very old Airbus aircraft, the video screen usually dont work in half the seats, they are very small and very unresponsive. Staff try repeatedly to reset the system and then tell you "sorry its not working in your seat, I can try to move you, away from your partner". The staff admit the planes are old and decrepit leased to the company by a middle eastern finance group. In my recent four transatlantic flights with the company on 3 occasions the entertainment system did not work for most of the journey. The customer services department ignore complaints, wont take phone calls and reservations department wont put you through to them, they dont have external phone lines, very poor attitude, best avoided on longer flights.

### "lunch was Ireland on a plate"
Dublin to Chicago. I do so wish that airlines would reflect their nationality in their food. Asian airlines do, to an extent, and i suppose Alitalia and Aair France serve something that identifies them. But sadly most airlines don’t. Chicken or fish, you get the idea. But on Aer Lingus a small revelation. An unpromising main course was “chicken in a savoury sauce” but the entire lunch was Ireland on a plate. Soda bread, a salmon starter, irish cheese but the entree sang out, “ this is Ireland” I can’t explain it more. The whole flight was very pleasant- service, seating, all pretty good. But that simple lunch will stay in my memory for a long time

### "Crew very good both ways"
I flew Dublin To Boston return with Aer Lingus on an A330. Pre-clearance at Dublin is great as one then arrives in US as a domestic flight. Left an hour late due to TSA hold up. Return flight 90 minutes late leaving, minor mechanical issue. Had exit row seat and no one next to me on return. Crew very good both ways.

### "such a bad experience"
Los Angeles to Brussels via Dublin. Beverage choice was very limited. Food was disgusting, seat was not comfortable and the entertainment system was not working. I had to request the flight attendant to restart 3 times the screen in my seat without success. A 10 hour flight in this kind of conditions is very difficult. The crew was gentle but they can’t help the customer in this kind of conditions if the equipment are poor. Such a bad experience never again.

### "the service was one of the worst"
For an economy class ticket (bought well in advance), this was by far one of the most expensive tickets I have bought to fly within Europe, and yet the service was one of the worst. Comparable to bare bone low cost companies, with the addition of outright rude and disrespectful staff. Both inbound and return flights were delayed. They barely acknowledged the 35min delay on the inbound flight as though this is something usual for them. The return flight was 1h30min late. This could happen to any company, however they did not bother to give any information until 5min prior to boarding. The staff were stressed and they rushed the passengers. If any passenger dared display any sign of discomfort they were both dismissive and outright disrespectful. In my case, the rude behavior came when I tried to explain to the young man who simply stuck a tag to my very modestly sized carry on luggage to check it in for a lack space in the overhead compartment, that I had made sure my bag fits under the sit in front of me. But, he did not have time for a 10 seconds conversation. He stubbornly continued to harass me at the door of the plane and refused to hear a word. I did not give him way and ended up peacefully placing my bag under the sit in front of me. After that, they finally explained to us while in the plane that they had to change planes and we would have to sit in this plane another 40min before being allowed to take off. All this stress, the rude behavior, the rush to board so we can sit wait in the plane. It's one thing to be late, it's another thing to inflict such chaos and discomfort to customers. Aer Lingus just joined my very short list of airlines to be avoided completely. I highly advise to stay away.

### "great care and attention"
Dublin to Paris. I had the opportunity to travel with my family and a group of other families who have special children on various treatments. We travelled to Disneyland Paris. Check in was a little bit disorganised but we ended up sailing through security as a designated area had been kindly provided. Onboard on the out ward journey, we had great care and attention by our cabin crew member who was so nice to all the children and the parents. I hope that if the company are reading this they can pass on our sincerest thanks for the care and attention we received by her. She had a natural warmth and empathy that was the style of the old Aer Lingus and that's what used to set EI apart from it's rivals. We arrived on time and it was nice to hear the cabin crew wishing all the children a pleasant stay in Disneyland as they hare a very special bunch of people. Back to Dublin we had a fairly standard service from the crew. Again arrived on time. I would be delighted to fly EI again but it would be nice to see more of the genuineness and friendliness that we experienced on our outward flight. It costs nothing but it makes a difference to those travelling.

### "still waiting for compensation"
Edinburgh to Dublin in August. Terrible. I only fly Aerlingus if I have no choice due to work. Aer Lingus didn't put my suitcase into the hold, along with 20 others due to space issues. Even though I paid £20 for the baggage. They then lied to me several times about the location of my luggage, which contained all my business clothes and medication. Eventually they delivered my suitcase after 4 days, just before I was leaving Dublin to fly home. I was forced to buy new clothes, toiletries etc at expense to myself which I am still waiting for compensation on after nearly 4 months. Aer Lingus ignored my complaints several times now and eventually promised to send me compensation, which then didn't appear - been waiting 6 weeks now for that.

### "Ryanair here we come"
Dublin to Gatwick, Sunday 3rd December 19.10 flight. It seems to be run for the benefit of passengers known to staff members. A stewardess appeared by my seat and announced I would have to get up to let in two passengers. Not excuse me - no manners displayed. These had been brought up from the back of the craft to better seats as apparently friends of someone. They also had free drinks as known to this special someone. I paid for my seat - like a few around me so this did not go down well. We sat for ages whilst staff members chatted and laughed and finally decided that the plane should fly. It did surprisingly land on time - which is a first - whereupon there followed a bun fight to grab cases and shove people out of the way merely to get on coaches. Ghastly. Ryanair here we come.

### "same as US domestic flights"
Washington to Dublin. The Boeing 757-200 was the same as US domestic flights and the plane was also very old. I cannot believe I am flying on southwest style airline internationally! Do not fly this airline if you are used larger planes for international flights.

### "Leg room more than adequate"
Business day trip to Cork and back. The flight was marketed as Aer Lingus Regional operated by Stobbart Air. Check in online. Free seat choice 24 hours before. 72 seat propeller aircraft configured 2-2. Outward - Very orderly boarding - from the rear only - so the rear seats were seen as 'preferred' and as such cost more to choose. I was in 4D aisle - I always prefer to be in front of the engines on a propeller plane. Leg room more than adequate and better than a lot of planes. Good sized overhead lockers. Inflight service consisted of snacks and drinks to buy - nothing special but fine for a short flight. Cabin noise was fine for a prop - but I had my noise cancelling headphones to help. On time performance and speedy transit through Cork - There was a passport control - which surprised me. Passports were not checked on the return. Photo id is needed to board. Return flight similar, except push back was 7 mins early and due to favourable tailwinds we arrived 25 mins early. Full flight - but despite narrow seats, I was comfortable. Disembarked Terminal 1 via a bus which took us to the UK domestic arrivals - so no passport control. Overall an enjoyable flight. So much better than the Flybe service to Belfast on the Dash 8 Q400. The ATR 72 seems a better plane.

### "service was excellent throughout"
I traveled onboard Aer Lingus flight 136 to Dublin last night. The experience was excellent and professional from check-in to landing into Dublin Airport. The ground crew were excellent. The onboard experience was wonderful with fantastic cabin crew who warmly greeted all passengers as they boarded the aircraft. My seat of 11-C was very comfortable with plenty of legroom. The service was excellent throughout the flight. Beverages kept flowing throughout the flight. The meal service was excellent. I have to say it was the best flight I have had and I greatly appreciate flying with my country's flag carrier. Aer Lingus, please keep up the great service.

### "I recommend this airline"
Dublin to Düsseldorf. Great flight. The boarding was perfectly on time and because I had a checked bag priority boarding was free also the seat selection for every seat on the plane, so I chose the seat 1F which included extra leg room. However the was no included free drinks or snacks on board and because I booked last minute the flight was quite expensive. Otherwise I recommend this airline!

### "I am glad I upgraded"
Dublin to Los Angeles. The airline has less frills than most but I experienced economy outbound and inbound business. I would have to say business class is much better. The flight attendants in the business class cabin are attentive and helpful when you need something. The food was fine but I think the second meal could of been improved. The choice of wine was good. Flat seats were comfortable as most business class seats go. I am glad I upgraded and was able too. Aer Lingus staff are very helpful at the check in Kiosks.

### "customer service was atrocious"
My review isn't about my Dublin to Stuttgart flight last week but about my experience on my return yesterday dealing with Aer Lingus Representatives in Stuttgart airport. Time of flight 16.10 EI0359. I arrived at gate 337 at 15.45. I was delayed going thru security as there was a very big crowd and the lines were going very slowly. I had a tub of hair conditioner and my bag was checked and tube removed. After I was refused entry I was told by german staff to ‘go down and out’ I was asking to go to customer services. Eventually one staff member showed me an exit and I went down to customer service. They just said gate was closed. Later I rang Aer Lingus and explained my story to a pleasant staff member. She asked me if they said anything about going on standby which they didn't. They didn't make any effort to make any other arrangements or explain about the extra €75 to book another flight which is posted on your website. I feel the experience was shocking and customer service was atrocious. I then had to book another Aer Lingus flight costing €158 to get home next when it should have only cost €75. How was I supposed to know if there is no one willing of able to tell me. I feel that I got a raw deal and no help. If you are operating flights to/from there you should have some decent representative who can advise when a mini crises presents. Up until this my experiences have been good with Aer Lingus.

### "definitely recommend Aer Lingus"
San Francisco to London Heathrow via Dublin. Very good transatlantic flights with Aer Lingus. Outbound from London to Chicago via Dublin, returning from SFO. Turned up early for the outbound flight at LHR and was immediately asked if I wanted to be bumped up to the earlier departure to DUB, which I was grateful for as I had a fairly tight connection and was transiting via US Pre-clearance there. I was impressed by the standard of amenities onboard and the professionalism of all crews. The food was of a very good standard, better than most I've tried and the crews on both long haul sectors ensured that beverages and some snacks were also available at all times from the galley. IFE on the A330's is excellent, works really well and has a wide selection of content. All of the aircraft were clean, modern and comfortable. Would definitely recommend Aer Lingus.

### "Leg room is about average"
Toronto to Dublin. A very respectable transatlantic offering. Decent seats and IFE. Leg room is about average and food service is relatively good. My only complaint would be that you can’t select seats if you’ve booked through an agency. Seems like a missed opportunity to charge for exit row seats or other upgrades.

### "Really bad service"
Amsterdam to Hartford via Dublin. Very dissatisfied with the way Aer Lingus handled my lost luggage. After returning to Amsterdam noticed my luggage wasn't there. Contacted Aer Lingus who told me they would take care of it and that I would be reimbursed for 60 euro per day. After two days finally got my luggage. Since then (februaru 2017!) I have been busy with getting my reimbursement. Tried it through multiple email and even more phone calls. Every time the same answer: "we are working on it, you will here from us" what never happens. Really bad service and the reason I will not fly again with Aer Lingus.

### "they have lost the bags both times"
Dublin to London Heathrow in Flex class, connecting to Bahrain. Flight delayed by 40 minutes due to slot delay. Arrived to LHR and made up some time with a 90 minute connection time from T2 to T4. I will say the crew were great with the Cabin supervisor being very efficent, friendly and professional. Arrived Bahrain no bag, this is the second time I have flown Aer Lingus and they have lost the bags both times. Not good enough if you paying nearly 400 euro for a ticket on such a short flight, Bag has just arrived to Bahrain but alas late for my meeting so I am sitting here in jeans and a T shirt. Last time I fly them as per last time bags went missing for 3 days on a 4 day trip and got zero response or compensation from them. Also as per many others avoiding LHR like the plague for connections.

### "staff was pleasant and welcoming"
Budapest to Dublin. Our flight was fully booked. Check-in was slow, but boarding was easy and we left on time. The plane hadn't been cleaned properly. There were papers on the floor and my travel magazine had a wad of chewing gum in it. The cabin staff was pleasant and welcoming: the flight itself was okay. However, the airline does not offer free refreshments, and one must pay over 2 Euros for even a bottle of water.

### "people sitting behind us were drunk"
Dublin to Alicante. To start I decided to bring my wife on a short break of 5 nights to Alicante for our upcoming 10 year wedding anniversary.I thought that I would book a holiday with 2 of our friends and without the kids which is the first time ever. We booked flights to Alicante flying from and back to Belfast for the 21-26 Sept 17 only to be emailed that due to operational commitments that the flights are cancelled. We got compensated and sorted things out, no big deal. We book for Dublin and arrive that day nearly 4 hours early only to be told that due to technical faults our flight was delayed by nearly 2 hours give or take. We got over that as going on a holiday even though we knew that because of their delay we were going to miss out on a full night in our apartment. The real mess started when we boarded the plane. To start we were on the same row 13 with 2 of us on each side. The group of people sitting behind us were drunk when they were allowed on board and they sat directly behind our rows about 3 to 4 rows on each side and the worst was sitting right behind my seat. She was in her mid 40’s and I couldn’t believe the filthy language coming out of her mouth in such a small enclosed area. She was making constant burping noises, cursing, everything that she had to say was shouted or screamed and constant sexual remarks to the male passengers across and behind her. The head flight attendant knew these people were full of drink because before the flight even took off they were shouting and roaring so she comes down a row in front of us and starts telling them that she can take anyone she wants off now who are acting to loud or she has the power to divert the plane at any stage if she feels fit and then disappeared straight away and left the customers to listen to the filth for the rest of the flight (Unbelievable). Just before take off another flight attendant asked me was I ok and I turned around and said to her was she kidding me and with that also disappeared. Again same thing happened during the flight. So we keep there the whole flight listening to this when 10 mins before landing the head flight attendant comes down to me and says are we ok which I really couldn’t believe just 10 mins to go so I tell her everything and said that it was a disgrace and she then says that people who were sitting 2 rows up from us that she moved them to the front of the plane because of the noise and brutal language. This I couldn’t believe as we were directly in front of the noise which I let her know. During all this my wife starts to cry infront of this attendant because of how upset she was that we were left there for the flight listening to all that was going on. In getting off the plane I also let the captain know and told him that it was a joke that he let them on the plane in the first place. I pointed out that if we had reported the noise to the flight attendant (Which she knew was going on) that next thing we would meet this group in the terminal or at our resort and end up getting harassed or worse.

### "agents abroad can be rude"
Dublin to Brussels. As said elsewhere a no frills airline pretending to be more. No business class to Europe but they will sell premium tickets for front seats (six across as economy) priority lane security and lounge access. The lounge is just OK with limited choice of food. Aer Lingus is the most delayed and highest cancelled flights airline I have flown, to the point I have stopped using them unless they are the only option. On my flights to Brussels from Dublin both legs were late, for Brussels you are emailed a pass for the BA lounge before your flight but unless you ask at check in your boarding pass won't be stamped for the priority security lane. As our flight was delayed and the lounge is that of IAG partner BA we were thrown out after the last BA flight left. The only upside was that the flight crew and Dublin ground staff to their credit are for the most part professional and pleasant. But Aer Lingus agents abroad can be rude -  that I was told by their agents in TLS since (on a flight my daughter was taking) "we don't do customer service if you have a problem with that complain to the police". I'll stick to Air France and change flights in CDG on EU short haul routes in future, at least they have customer service and know what it means.

### "this is a no-frills airline"
Toronto to Gatwick return via Dublin. My lasting impression is that this is a no-frills airline trying to put on a show like they aren't a no-frills airline. Everything was pretty much lack lustre, but they did get us from A to B to C and back again, on time. Positives: The four planes we travelled on were clean, tidy and comfortable. Cabin crew were very friendly and professional. They've got some good and experienced people working for them. We travelled in peak season so the flights weren't cheap, but outside of that time, they are one of the cheaper long haul airlines. Terms and conditions were made very clear during booking and check in. Connection through Dublin was easy and clear if a bit convoluted. Negatives: Pre-flight customer service was poor. Booking and online check in allowed for no seat selections to be made. At no point in the booking/check in process were we able to select seats, which was important to us due to the age and health of the travellers. Only through extended negotiation with contracted check-in staff at airport, who could see our needs, were we able to secure appropriate seats. Which left for a nerve-wracking build up to travelling. Special meal selections were inaccurate from booking - luckily we called up in advance to confirm. Food on outbound leg was good, but they ran out of the chicken option very quickly. Food on the way home was terrible. Entertainment selection is okay. The technology is poor, though. Had to reset my or my companions' screens at least once on each leg. Several functions did not work. Baggage handling is poor. Had a 2.5 hour wait at Toronto for baggage to come through. One lost bag. Despite which party was at fault, it was very poor customer service from Aer Lingus from that point on, with nobody to speak to at the company, and given telephone numbers cutting out upon connection. Seemingly there is no customer service department. Very few representatives on the ground. Would travel with them again given the cost, but with low expectations.

### "has no customer service team"
Our flight from Berlin to Dublin was diverted to Belfast due to fog. We then were delayed for 5 hours in Belfast (partly stuck on plane, partly in airport) with no information from Aer Lingus. When we finally did get information at approx 6.00 am (7 hours after planned arrival time) we were offered the choice to wait for buses to Dublin which would take two hours or pay to make our own travel arrangements and be reimbursed, we were told to keep all receipts due to this. Myself and my partner opted to get a taxi as we both had work the next morning at 9.00 am. We arrived to Dublin at 8.00 (8 hours delay). I started to try seek reimbursement as promised from Aer Lingus the next week, they have not provided me with this reimbursement and will not respond to me. They said they will not reimburse us despite the agreement that was made on the day. Unfortunately I cannot recommend an airlane that makes false promises and has no customer service team.

### "seat selection price put me off"
Dublin to Verona for the annual summer holiday 2 adults, 3 children. It had been some time since I had travelled Aer Lingus as normally they are out of budget for me. I booked the tickets in December. I was shocked to see that we had to pay 8 euro a head to be assured of sitting next to one another. This is significantly dearer than Ryanair. In the end it worked out ok. I think 30 hours to allocate seats is a bit too short notice. On arrival DUB T2 was mental and the automatic bag drop was brilliant and really user friendly. Boarding was done in a very relaxed manner by courteous staff and the flight itself was lovely. Really friendly staff with a bit of banter thrown in and plenty of updates from the flight deck. I would love to travel again with Aer Lingus especially with the children. It was a good product and the company should be very proud of its staff but the seat selection price and the 30 hour window really does put me off.

### "service onboard was swift and crew friendly"
Dublin - Lisbon. Evening flight out of Dublin (18.50) on 13th July delayed by over an hour due to late arrival of aircraft from Verona, Italy thus it was almost 8pm before EI486 took off. Crew apologetic. Boarding was well-organised despite a long queue forming before flight was ready. There was no surge of passengers rushing towards the gate as can happen with other airlines. Gate staff segmented passengers with priority and zonal boarding. Flight otherwise was pretty uneventful. Staff service onboard was swift and crew friendly. Despite the very late departure flight landed into Lisbon only a half hour behind schedule at 22.10 however relatively long wait for baggage arrival at belt after paying €35 to checkin the bag.

### "crew utterly professional and friendly"
Santiago De Compostela to Dublin with Air Lingus. Crew utterly professional and friendly from the word go. They engaged with passengers and freely struck up conversation with travellers, most of whom had been there to complete the Camino de Santiago. Boarding was well organised and swift, even with only one Iberia gate agent. There was a huge amount of cabin baggage, some of which exceeded the allowance, but the air stewards did their utmost to accommodate all bags and therefore avoided bags having to be placed in the hold and ultimately delay the flight. Flight left and arrived on time. Pilots provided flight information on a couple of occasions. I always enjoy flying Aer Lingus and the crew are a credit to our national carrier.

### "lose a day of our vacation"
Washington to Dublin via Boston. Aer Lingus partners with JetBlue for connecting flights in the US. Unfortunately if there are problems with the flights they both point fingers at the other and neither wants to step up and provide compensation. Our JetBlue flight was an hour late departing because they were "servicing" the plane causing us to miss our flight to Dublin. Three of us stood and watched the Aer Lingus flight in a queue, though apparently sitting in the queue was more important than waiting to board their three missing passengers (we were at the gate at departure time). Aer Lingus was unable to book my husband and me on another flight until the next evening causing us to lose a day of our vacation. The third gentleman didn't get out until much later. I have asked both airlines to provide some type of compensation. Both have refused and we don't qualify for compensation through the European rules because we used Aer Lingus's partner. So, beware of "partners. This arrangement seems to allow each to avoid responsibility.

### "definitely a no frills offering"
I fly between Dublin and Manchester most weeks. With Aer Lingus, the flight is usually reasonably comfortable - the arrival process is often a nightmare. Arriving at Dublin late at night, the aircraft usually parks away from Terminal 2 and there is a long long walk through a labyrinth of internal corridors. As noted by another reviewer, if it is an Aer Lingus regional flight, a compulsory bus tour of Dublin Airport is added to the experience. Arriving at Manchester on Aer Lingus also involves being bussed around that airport. Last Monday, the ground crew decided to economise on the number of buses. Our bus took an age to get to Arrivals. A hot day and severe overcrowding on the bus caused some passengers to panic. Not a pleasant experience. Aer Lingus does not speak to passengers. I could not find a phone number and I am told that Customer Services doesn't have a phone. Very good for cost control and efficiency, I am sure. Not so good if they want repeat business. Aer Lingus advertises itself as Ireland's only four star airline and I think it likes to portray itself as a traditional full service airline. Where UK/European flights are concerned, I think it's definitely a no frills offering.

### "Excellent flying experience"
Excellent flying experience from Dublin to New York return. Aircraft was nearly new, usb socket at seat, great IFE, decent leg room and recline. What stood out most was the exceptional crew, so friendly and helpful. A passenger behind me was feeling poorly and I overheard a flight attendant offering to make this passenger hot water, honey and lemon. That speaks volumes. The only issue was lost baggage which does happen frequently I believe but even still I rate the flight and airline 10/10.

### "friendly, helpful, cheerful"
We were delighted with our flights from Chicago to Dublin and then Dublin to JFK on the return leg. Boarding went smoothly and the aircraft was clean and in excellent condition. On our Chicago to Dublin leg the A330 was less than one year old. Entertainment system was excellent with many music and movie choices, which kept both adults and kids entertained. The newer aircraft on the first leg included a USB charging port at each seat. Food was surprisingly good, with a nice roast chicken entree offered on the DUB-JFK leg. Alcoholic beverages were about 6 Euros; no free booze in Economy. Seat comfort was actually quite good. I had plenty of leg and knee room despite being over 6 feet tall. Seat padding is a little thin, so if you are sensitive to that you might consider one of those airline seat pads. We were thoroughly impressed by the cabin crew - consistently friendly, helpful, cheerful. Unlike on the American carriers, they did not simply serve the meal and disappear. They were very helpful with our young children as well. Flights left the gate a bit late but arrived on schedule. The captain made such a soft landing at JFK that the whole plane clapped! And I should add the fare we paid was about $500 less than what AA and United were charging. The only negative was the WiFi, which I paid for on the first leg but only worked for about 30 minutes.

### "I pay more for Aer Lingus and I expect more"
Aer Lingus fly to Marseille terminal 2 which can be best described as a shed. It's the worst airport I've ever experienced. I fly to Lagos regularly which is not a good airport but Marseille is much worse, you are herded like cattle through the most utilitarian halls and corridors. Only budget airlines like Ryanair and Easyjet use Terminal 2, I pay more for Are Lingus and I expect more. On the return flight they ran out of food and cabin crew said that there were more people than expected on the flight - she couldn't answer when I said that surely they knew the return load factor before they left Dublin. Finally we disembarked at pier B and had an unpleasantly long trek to T2. Overall experience was poor - I don't fly with budget airlines because I want more, I pay more for Aer Lingus and I expect more.

### "crew were extremely friendly"
Chicago to Brussels via Dublin. Check in and boarding were efficient. Had use of the British Airways lounge in Chicago and the Aer Lingus lounge in Dublin. Both were OK, some beverages and snacks, very few power outlets. The flight from Chicago to Dublin was on time. Cabin crew were extremely friendly and provided good service. The food was pretty good. The WiFi worked well and was complimentary in business. The entertainment system works well, with a nice big and clear screen, but the movie selections were not great. The seat does go all the way flat, but it is difficult to adjust how you like in between that and upright. For some reason, there is no independent control just for recline. There is plenty of space for stuff you want to use during the flight so you don't need to keep reaching for the overhead bin. The flight from Dublin to Brussels was less good. There is no business class on this flight. Even though my end-to-end ticket was for business class, on this flight they don't even provide water or tea for free. This flight was also significantly delayed, by ATC, so that really wasn't their fault.

### "cancelled flight from Chicago"
They cancelled a flight from Chicago to Dublin due to weather, and diverted the plane to Detroit, a city in the path of the storm. This was a stupid move, but by the end of this review you will see this was actually the least of their mistakes. So upon cancellation, we are instructed to collect our luggage and stand in an incredibly long line. Eventually, you learn from others that the line is only to receive a hotel voucher, and that they are providing no help in re-booking flights, with some excuse that it's not their expertise. By the time you learn this (hours into the line their customer service call center has closed for the night. They run out of hotel vouchers by the time you get to the front of the line, but that's irrelevant. As soon as you do get them on the phone, (at 2:30 AM) you are told they cannot help you because you booked using credit card points, and you must call your credit card. They were supposed to help you; they cancelled the flight, its their responsibility to re-book. They later refuse to book me on another flight because they say I lacked a transit visa for Canada. Going on the Canadian government website and pointing out that US citizens do not need such a visa doesn't help,  because their goal is to avoid helping. These lies delayed our re-booking by hours, and we watched as flight after flight filled, pushing our departure back day after day. Their blatant effort to avoid having to pay another airline to re-book us has cost me the opportunity to be in Dublin for Bloomsday.

### "cancelled flight last minute"
Amsterdam to Newark via Dublin. They cancelled my flight last minute without me receiving an email. I got to the airport and I looked for their counter for 20 minutes and they told me that they don't have a counter so they use whatever counters are available. I spent 2 hours waiting for them to book a new flight ended up leaving 4 hours later than my original flight with another airline. Now, I'm taking my flight back home and I will like to upgrade my seat to economy plus or business and the lady was so rude. It does not make me want to spend my money in whatever upgrade I made in this airline.

### "we don't have an alternative"
Izmir to Dublin. Herded like cattle in walkway to board plane. Hot and smelly with some drunk passengers making a racket. We were in tunnel for near 20 minutes then there was a 30 minute delay before the plane took off. Decent fight home but had to walk down steps from plane. Walk across tarmac and then a 1/3 mile hike up and down and across the airport to get to passport control and baggage collection. Bad enough for us but a disaster for elderly. Or infirm to make this horrible journey. Aer lingus hold baggage costs are very high but they put our hand ouggage in hold free of charge yesterday? Hold luggage charges are obviously a great revenue generator for Aer Lingus. We only fly with them because we don't have an alternative.

### "pick any other than Aer Lingus"
I was traveling on Vacation from JFK to LIN, and this was my very first time using Aer Lingus. I don't plan to ever fly with Aer Lingus again. Some things are understandable and are outside of an airline's control. Many of the issues I had experienced were purely poor customer service. Upon arrival at JFK airport, I was immediately turned off at the fact that Aer Lingus is not part of TSA-Pre, meaning I had to go through the standard security check which takes a very long time. So I finally make it to my gate, and I am waiting to start boarding the aircraft. Our flight was supposed to depart at 17:30. 17:30 rolls around and I had to go up and ask the attendant at the gate to find out the plane wasn't cleared to land and had to continue flying past JFK to Boston? I've never heard of this happening before, but I wasn't too irritated as my connecting flight didn't depart until 0700 Ireland time. Well, the flight delay went on for over two hours, and I ended up missing my connecting flight. The delay was understandable, and I assume not the fault of the airline, but communication in regards to the delay was nonexistent. Here is where the real frustration and poor customer service begins. A chaotic, disorganized line forms at the customer service counter to arrange for new connecting flights. This line is so poorly organized that many people were waiting in the wrong line for a half hour, and the flight attendants were the ones who directed them to those lines! Exhausted after an over two-hour delay as well as a 5-hour flight, I wait in this line for 4 hours. This is not an exaggeration but timed. Finally, we get to the front of the line and are told we can't fly out until tomorrow, causing us to lose a full day of our vacation. Aer Lingus in no way compensated us for this inconvenience, or loss of a vacation day, or even offered us one of those $5 drink vouchers, nothing. They sent everyone to the same hotel that couldn't fly out overnight, which was then overbooked and many had to leave that hotel to find accommodations for the evening. This isn't the end of my poor customer service experience. Arriving at the airport for the flight back, with two hours leeway till our flight leaves, we get into a line that wraps around the check-in counter and stretches all the way down through part of the hallway. Aer Lingus had 1 check in counter. There were three desks and only one attendant. I got to my gate right before they shut the doors. I could not imagine what I would have done if I missed that flight and was stranded in another country. Last but not least, the chance to leave feedback to Aer Lingus ended the day I landed back in JFK. I guess they expect me to rate my experience while I'm flying with them. All in all, pick any other than Aer Lingus, and I pray no one else has to go through what I had to go through and have travel completely ruin their vacation.

### "unpleasant and unprofessional "
New York JFK to Dublin. This is in reference to my flight with Aer Lingus El108 which was scheduled to depart on Tuesday, April 18th from JFK to Dublin, Ireland. Prior to departure I received an e.mail advising that the flight was delayed from 8:50 pm to 10:45pm. On arrival at the Airport my family and I were greeted by non Aer Lingus staff and handed a piece of paper apologizing for the disruption to our travel plans - the Flight had been cancelled and no explanation was given as to why. Included was an “800” number (800-585-0672) to call and rebook or get a refund. I immediately started to call the 800 number which constantly rang with no response - some people were put on hold for a considerable amount of time and had to end up hanging up. When I approached a representative from Aer Lingus, who was constantly on his cell phone and not very approachable, I was basically told they couldn't guarantee that I would get on another flight on April 19th (the next day). Our travel plans were time sensitive since we were attending my niece’s wedding and my sister was acting as the mother of the bride since my niece’s Mum has passed away. I had no choice but to rebook flights with another carrier so we were guaranteed to at least attend the wedding! I called Aer Lingus the following morning and finally got a response to find out that all Aer Lingus flights were already booked out. In addition, I was told that the representative at the Airport should have informed us that they would do all in their power to get us on a flight the next day. In this case Aer Lingus should be responsible for the extra charges that was imposed on us because of their lack of responsibility. I returned from my two week trip to discover that Customer Service didn't have the common courtesy to respond to my email nor had they refunded, as promised, the money for the flight that was cancelled. I had to waste my time and energy dealing with their incompetent customer service and had to explain my case again and demanded a refund. I finally got an email of apology about the cancelled flight and the importance of reliable and safe travel and that I'm in total agreement with, however, I have a difficult time dealing with disinterested staff who appear not to care about their customers. Since Aer Lingus did not make any effort to resolve this issue, in a timely fashion, I will no longer consider Aer Lingus as a carrier of choice, nor will I recommend Aer Lingus as a travel option to others. Quite honestly Aer Lingus lag behind their counterparts when it comes to inflight courtesy and customer service. In this competitive market who would want to subject themselves to such an unpleasant and unprofessional environment.

### "have lost the personal touch"
Lanzarote to Dublin. I have flown Aer Lingus for many years and always found them to be very helpful and caring towards the passengers. My opinion changed a couple of weeks ago when I got horrible call while in Lanzarote that my mother was very sick and I needed to get home ASAP. I phoned Aer Lingus explained my situation. And after spending 40 mins on the phone to them they offered to change us all (myself, wife & 2 kids) to the flight that evening for nearly €2000. I kept calm and decided to go alone at a charge of €303 having to leave my wife and 2 kids to follow the next day. They said if I provide a Death Cert they'd return the change fee. Thankfully my mother is still fighting. But very disappointed in Aer Lingus that they have lost the personal touch they had and now like the others seem delighted to rip you off when they can. Especially when the availability was there to get us all home.

### Aer Lingus customer review
Fly Leeds to Dublin return nearly every week with Aer Lingus. Flight prices vary massively depending on journey and when I book but not in a way that makes sense. Staff are nice and efficient, seats are ok for a short flight. No complimentary food or drink but that's fine for such a trip. Leeds Airport is not very nice so I never board happy and the busing out and back to the plane at Dublin is shambolic. I have complained a couple of times and been told to contact Stobarts who own the flight (I hate that kind of buck passing response to a complaint). But the plus points are worth the hassle - almost always on time and in one piece.

### "crew were efficient and friendly"
Flew Aer Lingus return from Manchester to Dublin. Both flights departed and arrived on time. Although the flight is only a short hop across the Irish Sea, the seats 2F and 3F were very comfortable and leg room satisfactory. Cabin crew were efficient and friendly. Chose this flight because, with baggage it was cheaper than Ryanair. Would travel with Aer Lingus again.

### Aer Lingus customer review
travel between DUB and Frankfurt each week. Lately I am beginning to think about Lufthansa or Ryanair as my preferred carrier due to the following. Prices for flights have crept up considerably and it is now costing €130 on average more for a return flight than 6 months ago. I am a member of Aer Club and the roll out of this frequent flyer club has been a shambles, a situation that continues 5 months after the establishment of new scheme. Outstation lounges tend to be mediocre. Crew on short haul not that friendly. Aircraft are dirty as no cleaning done on turnaround.

### "Really great experience"
Hartford to Dusseldorf via Dublin. Really great experience! I've only flown transatlantic a few times now but this is the first time on Aer Lingus and I was very pleased. Only a few hiccups but the crew on board were some of the best I've experienced, and the price is fair relative to others. The meals, for airplane food, were really good. Will definitely consider Aer Lingus for any next overseas travel.

### "I was very happy"
I arrived in London 10 hours earlier than expected, due to changes in my flight from Bangkok. I arrived there around 6am and I was suppose to arrive at 4pm. I decided to try and went to Aer Lingus customer service in Heathrow Airport, explained the situation and asked if they could change my flight so I could travel earlier. Surprisingly, they said yes and they put me in the next flight at 9am, free of charge. I don't know if it was my lucky day but I was very happy. The staff was very friendly and flight was great.

### "was 23 hours delayed"
My Business Class flight recently from Boston to Dublin was 23 hours delayed. I asked for compensation but had no response from Aer Lingus for weeks. As a result of the above, Aerlingus did not capture my tier points for my Aerclub frequent flyer account. This was a system error on their part. Despite having written to them several times, they refuse to recognise the points added and upgrade me to the next tier even though the missing flight would take me to the next tier. This is customer care of the worst kind (absent, and even outright refusing to care). Response times are long, and the replies tend to be unhelpful and off the point.

### "will not choose Aer Lingus again"
Frankfurt to Toronto via Dublin. Pros: economic pricing, staff was generally friendly, movie selection ok Cons: old aircraft, baggage delay handled really poorly. No bags still after 48h, no contact from airline. Tried all channels, phone number on website only leads to baggage handler at the airport who doesn't have proper information and no authority to do any compensation. Social media does not publish comment, no answers to any of my emails other than an automated reply. I will not choose Aer Lingus again. It's not worth saving $200

### "both trips were superb"
I flew Aer Lingus from Chicago to Geneva via Dublin on February 11, 2017, returning from Geneva via Dublin to Chicago on March 6 in Business Class. This is the second year I have flown with Aer Lingus and I plan to make it an annual event. From the service onboard to the lounges and service on the ground, both trips were superb. The Business Class cabin from Chicago to Dublin on the A330 is spacious and very comfortable with lie-flat seats. The left side of the plane consists of single seats, and I was happily ensconced in seat 3A. The middle section is double seats and the right section is a mixture of double and single seats. 99% of the seats have aisle access. The movie selection is less extensive than on other airlines, but there are still good choices. The food is excellent, the linens and cutlery very attractive and the FAs were smiling and helpful throughout the 7 hour flights. The Aer Lingus arrival lounge in Dublin is comfortable and had enough amenities to make the 2 hour layover on the way to Geneva very refreshing. There is no Business Class on the European flights but international Business passengers can select the premium seats at the front of the plane. Unlike British, Swiss and others, there is no charge for seat selection on Aer Lingus if traveling in Business. A few years ago, I paid $90 to have a window seat in British Airways' Club World cabin and have fumed about it ever since. Returning to the States is the best feature of Aer Lingus as you pass through U.S. Customs in their U.S. Pre-clearance area in Dublin and do not have to go through customs or passport control upon arrival in the States; you simply collect your luggage and leave the airport. The new Business Class lounge after U.S. Pre-clearance is superb. It is called 51st and Green and has a view of the runways from every seat and table. There is an excellent buffet, superbly stocked bar, terrific coffee and desserts, lounge chairs, shower room, and the staff is efficient and pleasant. I cannot recommend Aer Lingus for travel from the U.S. to Europe more highly. Their rates are lower than any other airline's Business Class if you buy at least 30 days in advance and, in fact, are competitive with full Economy fares on some of the other carriers to Europe.

### "treated with respect"
❎ Unverified |  Dublin to Glasgow. I was delayed through ill health and numerous road works from Limerick to Dublin. I arrived late for boarding. The staff from Aer Lingus were wonderful. I cannot thank them enough for their mindness and compassion and of course their professionalism. Being disabled I have been badly treated while travelling but all the staff I had assistance from were wonderful. It was lovely to be treated with respect.

### "in general a very poor service"
Dublin to Orlando. Aircraft and seat in general were very good. Seat cushions a bit hard but everything else about seat and amenities offered were very good. Inflight entertainment choice was ok, but not great. Where Aer Lingus let themselves down in this case (flown them before in business class and service was good) is their crew and sloppy / poor inflight service. I don't know if it was the route and they were not used to business class being full. Crew member was rude, uncaring. I had to get up and get my own drink as they forgot twice. Waited 20-25 mins between courses. Second meal service not even offered  (to me). Just in general a very poor service.

### "I find the baggage fees to be too expensive"
Flew from Dublin to London Heathrow. The Aer Lingus terminal is a pleasure to use and very modern with helpful uniformed staff at hand. Check-in was nice and easy and a uniformed staff member offered to assist. She was very pleasant and chatted to me this setting a good impression. Boarding was managed reasonably well but as is often the case the passengers were allowed to carry far too much luggage creating a sense of chaos. I was not impressed with the luggage issue nor with the rather rushed safety instructions. I bought a cup of tea during the flight. The crew were neat and tidy, As I left the flight I said thank you and good bye in Irish and was surprised when the cabin crew member frowned at all. The ticket price was reasonable but I find the baggage fees to be too expensive.

### "curious to see how it had evolved"
Dublin to London Heathrow return. I was planning a day trip to London, and as I hadn’t travelled through Heathrow for over two years, I was curious to see how it had evolved since 09th July 2014 when Aer Lingus moved their operation from Heathrow Terminal 1 to Terminal 2. At the time, four main benefits arising from moving to T2 were heavily publicised:  Public transport within 15 minutes of landing. Luxurious Gold Circle Lounge within minutes of check in. State of the art facilities. A seamless faster security and check in process. In addition, this was my first booking since the introduction of Aer Lingus’ loyalty programme, now named “Aer Club”. The booking process on Aer Lingus website remains broadly the same. The three fare types are now named Saver, Plus & Advantage with each earning a different amount of tier credits. One benefit I noticed is that when selecting the Plus fare, all seats are now included as complimentary: heretofore the front rows had to be paid for. As I was travelling within the 30 day window, I was able to check in immediately and print my boarding passes. I arrived at Dublin Airport at 7.00am for my 0845 am flight. I wanted to enquire about changing my seat on the outbound leg, and I called to the Gold Circle check in desk. Staff greeted me with a smile and within seconds had issued me with a new boarding card, and wished me a pleasant flight. My current Aer Club tier is Silver which includes fast track security. Only two people were in front of me and I was airside within a couple of minutes. I had a quick look around the bookshop and made my way to the Lounge, where I was greeted by the same staff with whom I dealt at the Gold Circle desk. We joked about the speed with which she moved from the check-in area to the lounge. Definitely the complete antithesis of the fabled lounge dragon! At approximately 8.20am, I made my way to gate 409 where boarding was underway. There are two separate boarding lines: General and Priority (for Aer Club members, flexible ticket holders) and it works very well. While walking towards the airbridge, passengers sitting in the rear half of the aircraft are directed towards steps at the rear door, and the front half board via the airbridge. This speeds up the boarding process, particularly on busy flights. The A320 was clean , and cabin crew warmly welcomed passengers. After a safety briefing and flight information from the Captain, we were underway quickly. During the flight, I indulged in the Irish Breakfast. Not the cheapest at 10 euro, but very tasty indeed. We landed on time in Heathrow, and after a short taxi were on stand at 11am. We deplaned quickly, and  I was sitting on the Tube at 11.15am.

### "passengers who require assistance should be allowed to board first"
I have used Aer Lingus twice now and I cannot thank the staff enough. I was traveling with my 80yr old father who required assistance, the OCS staff were so helpful especially in Ireland. Dads wheelchair was waiting for him and we where taken to our departure gates with no problems. On our flight from Hartford an air stewardess went above and beyond helping us, she was kind and considerate making sure my Dad was ok offering him tea and checking that he was comfortable. My only issue was when departing Ireland to go to Glasgow an announcement was made that anyone requiring assistance was allowed on the bus. So we went on the bus, however that was a mistake, we had to wait until all the passengers boarded and that took a while and it was freezing, then once we got off the bus we were not fast enough to get to board first, we where actually the last passengers to get on the flight, my father was cold and having difficulty standing. I would suggest those passengers who require assistance should be allowed to board first.

### "good punctual service from Aer Lingus"
London Heathrow to Shannon. Check in at the Aer Lingus Transfer desk (after transfer from Stockholm) was quick and efficient, as soon as I had checked in the flight was due for boarding. Terminal 2 in Heathrow makes for a quick efficient transfer. Upon boarding the flight was only about 70% full, so the seat next to me was free, which made for a comfortable flight. The seat itself was the new Blue colour leather ones with the adjustable head rest, seat pitch was reasonable for the hour flight to Shannon. After a quick taxi and take off, the crew started the in-flight service with the buy on board cafe, I ordered a hot toasted sandwich and tea, which was okay and filled a spot but not much more. Crew were the friendly and engaging with the customers on the flight and the flight crew kept us up to date. Overall good punctual service from Aer Lingus.

### "Cabin crew friendly"
Gatwick to Dublin. Efficient, friendly and early, with a spare seat next to me. Cabin crew friendly, boarding quick, departure on time. If only every flight was like this. Despite warnings of dire weather and freezing conditions we arrived early at Dublin.

### "everything went smoothly"
Boston to Gatwick via Dublin. A great experience and everything went smoothly. Inflight entertainment was very good. My only complaint is they seem to keep the seat-belt sign on even during smooth sailing. I suppose this eliminates a lot of people crowding the aisles but it makes me uncomfortable and hesitant to use the restroom. Flights both left on time and arrived somewhat early. The coffee was awful and I paid GBP3 for it. Small thing but still.

### "the experience was a mess "
Aer Lingus is a nightmare. I purchased a trip to Madrid from Boston with an hour layover in Dublin. Both legs of the journey were run by Aer Lingus. However, the gate distance and short time frame provided made it physically impossible to make the flight connection. I ran to the gate and they had already closed it-- I can't believe Aer Lingus sold the tickets as if it would be possible to make the connection. I rescheduled at the sales booth (this is why they get one point-- the woman working at the desk was super friendly and kind) but the next flight was not until 8 hours later so I had to stay in the airport. To top it all off they somehow managed to lose one of my two checked bags and it took them 3 days to get it to me in Madrid. The experience was a mess - avoid this airline at all costs if you can.

### "plane was incredibly uncomfortable"
Boston to Dublin. I hoping to find an alternative to my regular route through London with British Airways. I was really disappointed with Aer Lingus because the plane was incredibly uncomfortable. It was the first flight in years where actually sitting in the seats was deeply uncomfortable. And I do mean seats. I had to move twice as my first seat had a broken headphone connection, the second seat was in a weird location with fixed sides so I couldn't move my hips at all and twisted my back. I was surprised by how many people had major issues with their entertainment screen and I was surprised by how poor it was. The touchscreen was more like "hit it 4 or 5 times" screen and watch it go to the wrong thing. I had to use the remote to navigate and it still did not register after 3 times of hitting the button. I gave up after one show because the headphones (a double prong jack so I couldn't use my own headphones) sounded like people talking into a tin can. Everything felt so outdated. I spent a good time out of my seat toward the end of the flight trying to help my back recover. Another bizarre thing was how often they interrupted the entertainment system (or in many people's case sleep) to give inane commentary or play an advert (!) for something Irish or a charity partner. That's find at the end of the flight but in the middle of the night over and over again? It's such a shame as the connection through Dublin was lovely and the short hop to Berlin was just fine, but I just won't be putting my body through that again for long haul.

### "clearly see the drop in standards"
Emerald one world member. Dublin to Amserdam one way on a fully flex ticket cositng 340 euro. EI 606 our flight was cancelled at the last minute due to fog. Of course this is out of the airlines control but the follow up on service is where an airline shows their true colours. The ladies in the lounge were helpful and pleasent and gave us options, being wait and see for a later flight or take Brussels and take a train at our own expense. We decided to wait and the EI 608 was then departing. I was asked then to go to arrivals hall collect my luggage and recheck it in departures which I did. We lost the seats we had paid for on exit rows and recieved the last seats on the plane seperated, not an issue and glad to get to AMS but we do not get any refund. We boarded and were then delayed a further 90 minutes due to slot retrictions. Very full flight and the crew were if anything regimental, not one smile out of them. On landing we arrived to no bags, others were in the same situation and were told as the aircraft was full bags were off loaded and they would be on the next flight . we waited 3 hours and of course no bags. We chased the bags, no one knew where they were for two days when they finally arrived on the last day of our holiday. To add insult to this they then inform us that we have to send all receipts by "post" to Dublin for refund. A nice sly trick to put people off trying to claim for their incompetence. Since British Airways bought Aer Lingus you can see very clearly the drop in standards and staff moral. Just like BA, has gone down the tubes with service.

### "the worst flying experience"
Dublin to Fuerteventura EI770 on December 27th with my wife. Seats 5a and 5b. We waited until after the food and drink service finished before reclining our seats. The people behind were kicking and pulling the seats for quite a lot of the way. About 40 mins before landing the man behind just pushed my wife's seat forward aggressively several times. We called the cabin crew, and the CSD came down to us. Despite the couple behind being quite drunk, and very aggressive, her way of dealing with the situation was to ask us to put our seats upright. We complied with her request and then had to put up with our seats being kicked and loud comments for the remainder of the flight. This is the worst experience I have ever had on any airline, and it was compounded by the way it was dealt with. At no point did the CSD speak to them and ask them to calm down, nor did she ask them to stop disturbing us. It felt like we were being punished by the airline, and that the most aggressive passengers were being rewarded. If they were that drunk over three hours into the flight then it had to be due to drink sold onboard to  them, and this is unacceptable. I appreciate that the CSD did what they felt would easily diffuse the situation, and we complied with her request. However she should have made appropriate requests of the other passengers, and she did not. When we landed and had just left the runway, the drunk guy behind stood up in the aisle and proceeded to get his luggage down, we were on the taxiway, they just left him alone despite this being a safety issue. I received a form response from Aer Lngus, and I thought they would at least give us a complimentary drink on our return flight, but nothing. I have to give this the lowest possible rating as it was the worst flying experience in my life, including customer service.

### "impossible to get comfortable"
Newark to Dublin. Haven flown Aer Lingus in the past we decided to spend a little extra to go with them over the competition (United) as our last long distance flight was good with them. On this occasion however that faith was misguided. Their A330-200 aircraft looked good until we sat down and found the seats to be very hard. Was impossible to get comfortable in them. We took off over an hour late and got in about 30 mins late into Dublin. First a drink was served, only soft drinks are free, and you get a small bag of pretzels to go with them. Then dinner was served. By the time they got to us they only had the beef left. Which was the worst airline meal I have tasted, no flavor at all. The inflight TV the map was broken and half the movies were coming soon - very poor choice. I decided to rest for a bit but couldn't sleep as the headrest would not move to my height - I'm only 5 foot 7. When it came to asking for breakfast when they were serving it, I was told we only have breakfast for 60% of the flight, too bad for you we ran out, not even a drink was offered. Service on Aer Lingus has gone downhill.

### "onboard service has improved"
Shannon to Boston: Booked with Aer Lingus as it was a direct flight to Boston from Shannon, getting through Shannon was a breeze with little or no queue at check in or security and the added bonus of clearing US immigration before you leave Ireland. The flight was only over half full so there was plenty of room to stretch out, particularly in the back cabin, as most passengers were up in the middle cabin. The seat was comfortable for the flight, with the only downside compared to United is Aer Lingus don’t have a headrest that you can adjust to your height. After takeoff the crew handed out a small lunch menu and then offered a drink and packet of pretzels (there was a charge for alcoholic drinks but soft drinks were free), this was followed by the main course. I chose to upgrade my meal on my booking to the steak meal, which was worth it as it was served before the rest of the cabin, was on Porcelain with a bottle of wine included, this was then followed by a tea/coffee after dinner. There was a decent choice of movies and tv shows provided on the AVOD system, and prior to landing a sandwich and a Butlers chocolate bar were handed out. I found the crew on the flight friendly and responsive to customer requests throughout the flight. The flight landed ahead of time into the Jet Blue Terminal in Boston, which is more cramped than Terminal E, which they previously used. Overall a good experience with Aer Lingus, their onboard service has improved over the last time and I used them and the crews I found friendly and helpful.

### "Not a good day for Aer Lingus"
We were loaded promptly at 11.50am and the seat was comfortable enough and reasonable space for the short flight to Dublin. The seats were leather  and the flight was full. Once onboard the captain announced a delay in our flight and said that we had been given a slot for 13:45. As we were on the plane, there was no option but to sit and wait. I don't know why they do this. Why board us? On arrival to Dublin, there was a last minute gate change, which kept us on the tarmac for a few moments longer as there wasn't an airport marshal available at the gate to guide the aircraft to stand. Once at the gate there wasn't any OCS personnel available for my wheelchair assist and I had to sit and wait for a full 35 minutes longer, whilst they arrived. Not a good day for Aer Lingus.

### "cheapest option for my dates"
Heathrow to Manchester via Dublin. This routing provided me with the cheapest option for my dates. The first leg was on a very comfortable A320. I had hand baggage only so through security and dashed to gate 21 in time for boarding. At the gate priority boarding had begun and it was nice to see this being enforced. The pilot and first officer (both females) provided routing information several times during this short 52 minute hop to Dublin. The cabin crew provided their onboard service with a surprisingly large uptake, however sitting in row 15 I was one of the first to be served a tasty Irish breakfast for just €10. I whipped around T2 in Dublin via flight connections and was soon back in the departure lounge for my 12:15 flight to Manchester. Boarding was announced from gate 337 for 10:45. A little early if you ask me and it didn't actually get away until 12 so lots of sitting around but plenty of seats. This flight is operated by Stobart Air but everything is very similar except the aircraft. They boarded by row numbers this time so sitting in 13D I waited till last. The flight was not full but the plane was old. The crew brushed over the safety demonstration and we didn't hear from the cockpit at any point but we soon were up late and after 22 minutes were safely on the ground. The crew weren't very good they just offered the bare minimum. Overall the A320 was very good with professional service however I don't think I will be recommending their regional partner anytime soon.

### "crew helpful and attentive"
Shannon to New York with Aer Lingus. We travelled as a family of 4 with 2 young children, 3 year old and 1 year old. We had a good flight on way to New York. On the return flight my 1 year old was tired and ratty, we were travelling over night, the flight crew were excellent, so helpful and attentive, it made our journey much easier, definitely should be complimented on their good work.

### "staff were extremely nice and helpful"
Overall we had a good experience flying Aer Lingus from JFK to Dublin for the first time. It's better to get two seats on the sides of the aircraft. The middle section does not have a lot of leg room and can be a bit uncomfortable during a long flight. Unfortunately, you cannot pick your seats when booking. The staff were extremely nice and helpful.

### "poor relative to today's expectations"
Dublin to Washington with Aer Lingus. A dire experience - more akin to flying transatlantic 20 years ago. The food required cross-checking to the menu to see precisely what you were being served. They charge for even the first alcoholic drink. The entertainment system represented a selection of programmes/music from the 'bargain bin' of a now-defunct high street shop. There was a pathetic amount of leg room which, when you upgrade for more space - you get the joy of sitting next to the inflatable chute, and so get less space. Perhaps no surprise, the plane was 17 years old (according to the stewardess) - meaning that the overall appearance was in keeping with the experience, though was so poor relative to today's expectations.

### "no longer consider to be an option"
Chicago to Dublin. My travelling partner had pre-arranged a wheel chair. On one segment of the flight of the flight, she had to be lifted onto the plane via the equipment used to load the food. It was apparent that no one was aware that she could not use the exterior steps. Upon arriving in Dublin after initially departing from Chicago, there were no personnel with a wheel chair. We had originally ordered one for myself as well, but chose to opt out. I had to carry my own bags while pushing her in the chair as assistance was unavailable. Those were my primary concerns, but in addition the food was sub par to say the least. What marketing person decided that a ham and cheese sandwich would make a gourmet breakfast? In summation, we will no longer consider Aer Lingus to be an option when travel plans include overseas flights.

### "will book Aer Lingus again"
Dublin to Heathrow. Over the last few months I have travelled quite often for business and family purposes. This flight stood out. I had a very early check-in and found the staff on the check-in desk to be remarkably friendly and helpful too. Boarding was for a change, organised and well managed and the cabin crew were very welcoming too. One cabin crew member remembered me from a previous flight and went out of her way to make a conversation with me. I appreciated that. Drinks and snacks were for sale and the staff worked very hard to make the flight enjoyable and memorable. The crew of this Aer Lingus flight won me over and I will book Aer Lingus again in the future.

### "I will avoid Aer Lingus"
Boston to Dublin. For a trip to Ireland I selected Are Lingus and had high expectation. However, this was one of the worst overseas flights I have been on. Food service was poor. The portions were tiny and not very tasty. They managed to make a bland chicken curry. No complementary beer or wine, in fact on a seven hour flight they have you one chance to buy a drink about half an hour before dinner service and announced that if you wanted a drink with dinner this was you one and only chance. Getting water was a challenge and what they gave you was a tiny sealed cup. The worst of all was on the flight to Dublin. It was a morning arrival and they passed out little snack boxes. When asked for coffee we were told they don't serve coffee on flights that get in in the morning - no morning coffee is unbelievable. When they finally picked up after dinner trash they has a large cardboard box on a serving cart they pushed down the aisle. Coming back there was a 90 minute delay, after the plane was towed to the gate. You would think that after that long a delay the cabin would be clean and ready for a seven hour flight - it was not. There was prior flight paper trash in the seat back pockets and the carpet looked like it needed a good cleaning. Flight attendant were efficient, but not very friendly. I plan to fly to Ireland again in the next year or two, but I will avoid Aer Lingus.

### "far too much luggage allowed into the cabin"
Aer Lingus, Dublin to Heathrow, 27 October 2016. This flight was a connection flight following on from a transatlantic flight with a different airline. This flight was delayed due to the inbound flight also being late arriving in from London. The delay was almost 1 hour which was tolerable. Boarding was not well managed and there was far too much luggage allowed into the cabin. The cabin crew seemed to rush the safety announcements and during the flight the priority seemed to be to sell as many drinks and snacks as possible. Disembarkation was also not well managed. I will however state that the ground staff and cabin crew were polite and civil. The hot drinks are far too expensive.

### "only the highest praise"
Boston to Dublin with Aer Lingus. From check-in staff to onboard flight attendants I have only the highest praise. At the check-in desk staff was so pleasant and helpful by putting in my air miles and apologising that they had to charge me $100 for my extra bag that I almost felt sorry I had made her have to be sorry. The plane was not a full flight and there were adequate staff onboard. The flight attendants were the best I have encountered in my many Aer Lingus flights. One in particular went out of her way to ask was there anything we wanted. Not only to my husband and I but the passengers around us as well. It's not only the cheaper flights, good destinations and comfortable planes that makes Aer Lingus the great airline it is. It is more importantly crew.

### "ATR42 well worn inside"
Commuter flight from Dublin T2 to Doncaster (UK) on ATR42. Functional waiting area with coffee and snacks available, before being bussed to the airplane for an on-time departure. The airplane was a 16 year old ATR42, and looked decidedly tatty and well worn inside. Interior panels were scratched and faded, seats were worn and had loose stitching. Only one FA for about 40 passengers raised safety and service concerns, but as I was in Row 5, at least I got my coffee (€ 3) quickly. No complaints about the flight, service, or anything else. Everything ran to time, and Doncaster airport is a breeze - land, step into terminal, and 5 minutes later you are outside.

### "nothing wrong with the service"
Evening flight from Leeds to Dublin on ATR 72-600. This 3 year old airplane was in immaculate condition. Departure 10 minutes early. Friendly service from two very well turned out FA's. Captain's pre flight introduction was perfunctory to the point of being rude. Didn't introduce himself, his first officer, or the FA's. Unusual for Aer Lingus, and noticed by the senior FA, who immediately followed the captain's announcement with another of his own, in which he gave us all the names. Absolutely nothing wrong with the service, flight, or anything else, but the fact that the captain followed up with a further equally perfunctory announcement grated a bit.

### "excellent onboard product"
Dublin to New York JFK. The experience prior to boarding was pretty poor - unable to check in via the app, then once checked in online unable to collect a boarding pass from a self service kiosk, so had to queue for a boarding pass at the business check in, even though I was taking hand baggage only. There were only 2 people in front of me but they both seems to have issues checking in so it all took far longer than it needed to. The next drawback was being called from the lounge before they were ready for boarding at the gate, so all of the business passengers were left hanging around for 10 mins or so at the gate unnecessarily. However, these issues were largely outweighed by the excellent onboard product. Great seat (albeit a bit uncomfortable when sat upright), attentive service with good food and drinks, and a good entertainment system, although the movie selection is a bit limited. Overall a good experience, but some better attention to detail needed on the pre boarding elements to create a smoother overall experience.

### "greatest benefit is the choice of terminals"
A320 aircraft retrofitted into the classic colours of Aer Lingus legacy Aircraft. The short hop of 60 minutes to Dublin from London has few areas to distinguish itself from its competitors of Ryanair and BA but it still managed to. As a frequent flyer the greatest benefit is the choice of terminals. T2 at Heathrow and T2 at Dublin which are undoubtedly better then T1 at Dublin and Luton, Gatwick, Stansted of Ryanair and on the same par as T5 of BA. No free drinks or food like BA though.

### "usually run out of hot food"
Dublin to London with Aer Lingus. Flights are often delayed. One hour delay for a flight that is only 40 min long. They usually run out of hot food and sandwiches as the crew don't have time to refill the kitchen. Buying extra luggage costs a fortune. Will never fly with them again.

### "frustrating end to a great weekend"
Dublin to London Heathrow with Aer Lingus. Extremely disappointed with quality of service. Very frustrating end to a great weekend in Dublin with an hour delay flight on Sunday evening. It is unacceptable for a short destination flight to be delayed for that long. The reason given was the aircraft still being in the air on the way from London. The airline is trying to squeeze as many flights as possible and clearly this does not work as they are constantly late.

### "well worth the 120 euros"
We flew Aer Lingus from Dublin to Alicante as the ticket price was 40 euros per person one way. It was cheaper than normal, as a last-minute ticket buying. The flight was at 4:30PM and we arrived at Dublin Airport at 2:30PM, so had plenty of time to head through security and to get a bite to eat. The plane started to board a couple minutes early. Flight Attendant showed us our seat and welcomed us nicely. There was plenty of legroom on the A320 and the seat reclined nicely. When they were giving out food and snacks to buy, I ordered the ham and cheese melt - by far the nicest meal I've got on a short-haul flight. The cabin crew were very friendly and I would recommend Aer Lingus. It was well worth the 120 euros for the 3 of us to go on that flight to Alicante.

### "no complaints from efficient service"
Dublin to Doncaster. Commuter flight operated by Stobart for Aer Lingus on ATR 72. Efficient check-in, bus to airplane at remote stand. For a short flight (around 50 min) the ATR 72 is comfortable, and quiet. Seats are standard economy with reasonable pitch. Mostly business travellers, so cabin crew had an easy time. Not much time for food or drink, but coffee was served (extra charge), and it was nice and hot. Cabin crew were friendly and efficient. Doncaster offers a quick pass through customs, and as most travellers were probably going out one day and returning the next day, there was no queue at baggage claim. Overall, no complaints from this efficient service.

### "we are very disappointed"
In September 2015 my wife and I booked tickets with Aer Lingus, departing March 31, 2016 from Toronto to Dublin, connecting to Bristol. Our return was with Aer Lingus, departing from Geneva April 23 to Dublin, connecting to Toronto the same day. We booked our tickets 7 months in advance to take advantage of the lower ticket prices. However, on Feb 3 (five months after our booking date and, weeks before our departure) Aer Lingus agent called to inform us of our return flight change. Our departure time from Geneva was changed from 10:40 am to 4:05 pm. This meant we had to stop overnight in Dublin and, take the connecting flight the next day to Toronto. I asked about our overnight stay in Dublin and, the agent told me that we had to arrange for our own accommodation or, we could cancel our tickets at no cost. Cancellation was not desirable because the ticket prices had gone up at this time due to start of high travel season. The next day my wife called Aer Lingus Customer Service about our expenses in Dublin and, she was told that, on our return we could submit our expense bills to Customer Service for reimbursement. At the Aer Lingus check-in desk in Geneva airport we asked the supervisor the reason for cancellation of our Flight departing 11:50am. The supervisor told us that, for many years he had been working there, the flight always left Geneva in the afternoon. As such, we gathered that Aer Lingus had sold us tickets to a flight that never existed! It appears that, Aer Lingus sells tickets for non-existence flight so to get the customer but, later close to departure time informs the customer under duress of the flight change with option to cancel! The Aer Lingus supervisor in Dublin airport told us he could have put us up at Carlton hotel but, because we had had arranged for our own accommodation at Clayton Hotel, we had to pay for our hotel and meals and then, submit our bills to Aer Lingus Customer Service for reimbursement. After returning to Toronto, we forwarded the bills for our accommodation and meals in Dublin as well asking for reimbursement of our expenses in Dublin but, Aer Lingus refused to compensate. We are very disappointed with Aer Lingus.

### "pleasantly surprised at the level of service"
LHR to Shannon return on a rather cramped small plane. I was pleasantly surprised at the level of service, as I had heard this airline referred to as "Air Fungus! It was an enjoyable flight, and the FA's were friendly and attentive. I enjoyed the Captain's announcements in Irish Gaelic, even though I couldn't understand it, but he repeated it in English. The gent next to me ordered a toasted sandwich, which took so long to be delivered he had to gulp it down as we were landing, and even then he only had time to eat half of it. A pleasing alternative to using that "Other Irish Airline". My only other quibble, and it's a nit-picky one, is that the female FA uniform contains too many varying shades of Teal/Aqua, and doesn't quite gel together, but I'm no fashion expert. I would certainly fly Aer Lingus again.

### "behind their American counterparts"
As an Irish citizen living abroad, the sight of the Aer Lingus plane at the terminal fills me with a sense of home. I chose the airline for a return trip Dublin to San Francisco and back via Phoenix. I regret to say that it'll probably be the last time I fly with them transatlantic. They lag far behind their American counterparts for basic service and in flight entertainment. Also, the food is very poor. The staff are unapproachable and give the impression that they hate their jobs. The movie choice is limited. The food was shocking on both legs. The return leg from Washington to Dublin was cramped and overheated. Having flown extensively from Schiphol to the USA, I can recommend KLM, United or Delta over my own national carrier.

### "low prices are the only thing they have going for them"
Got a very good deal on flights from New York JFK to London Heathrow, and Barcelona back to New York JFK, now I know why: their low prices are the only thing Aer Lingus have going for them. On the trans-Atlantic legs, you only see the drinks cart roll through once the entire flight, shortly after departure. Drinks are not served before or after the meal, as is common on most airlines, unless you actually demand a soda or something with your meal, which was awful both to and from JFK to Dublin. Also, sodas come in 6 ounce/150ml cans, and you get an angry glare from FAs if you ask for two, you must also be insistent that one tiny can simply isn't enough. The inflight entertainment system is very glitchy and often freezes, and the headphones are the most uncomfortable kind, and literally fall apart mid-flight. As not even water is ever offered the rest of the 6+ hour flight, you have to go back to the galley and literally demand or beg for something to drink during the flight. And on the intra-European flights, even a glass of water is offered only grudgingly, otherwise anything else comes at an added cost. Can't see why or how this can be a 4-star airline, and even with their low prices I wouldn't want to subject myself to EI ever again.

### "re-evaluate their meal service"
I recently flew Aer Lingus from Frankfurt to Boston VIA Dublin with my two young children, to take advantage of their US Preclearance. The flight was fine, the staff were friendly, and the process of going through customs and immigration in Dublin rather than Boston was excellent. For this reason I would recommend Aer Lingus, with some reservations. They lost my bag on the return flight, and took over three days to bring it to me, which was quite a hassle. I have never waited that long for lost luggage. The one major problem, though, was the food. I don’t expect airline food to taste good, but on our first flight both options were spicy, and by the time they reached us, they only had a very spicy chili. One of my children didn’t eat it at all (luckily there was at least a little bread), the other ate a little, and then vomited a few hours later. I ate most of our three meals, and felt quite sick for the rest of the flight. For the return flight I ordered children’s meals for all three of us, and even these were somehow too spice for the kids to eat. I don’t know how or why anyone needs to make chicken fingers and potato puffs spicy, but these were. It is unconscionable to have only spicy options on a flight, and to worse to serve food that makes your passengers sick. Not to mention the fact that the airline clearly knows how many children are on a flight, and could easily provide children’s meals for any children flying. Icelandair provides children’s meals that are well thought out (food kids actually like), and brings these meals immediately, as soon as the plane takes off, so the kids and parents can stay calm and happy – and Iceland Air doesn’t offer complimentary meals, so this service goes above and beyond what passengers might expect. Aer Lingus has a lot of good points, but they need to seriously re-evaluate their meal service.

### "experience was not a good one"
Flew Aer Lingus with my partner as the it provided the most direct route between Edinburgh and Dublin. Despite travelling together and checking in together we were seated separately. On arriving at the gate we approached a small group of ground staff who were chatting to see if there was any possibility of sitting together. The gate agent was rude and dismissive stating "if your flying to Dublin go over there and sit down". After trying to discuss our request she was quite dismissive stating that the previous nights flight was cancelled and she was not prepared to move another passenger to help us. Just appalling behaviour. The flight crew were average with one crew member unable to generate a smile for the entire flight. The lavatory on board was filthy, so dirty I didn't want to touch any of the surfaces. This despite the fact that the cabin crew found plenty of time to sit and read. My overall experience with Aer Lingus was not a good one and will not be using this airline again.

### "I barely made the flight to Chicago"
I recently flew Aer Lingus from Edinburgh to Chicago, changing flights in Dublin. The scheduled layover was 2 hours, but the originating flight from Edinburgh was more than 45 minutes late leaving the gate. When I realized how little time I was going to have to make my connecting flight from Dublin to Chicago I asked a member of the ground crew at the boarding gate desk in Edinburgh for assistance in changing flights in Dublin. My right arm was in a sling due to a broken shoulder and I was walking with a walking stick, carrying a purse and pulling a rolling backpack. The boarding gate attendant told me I would have plenty of time and no problems and refused to procure any assistance for me. Long story short, I almost fell on one of the many escalators that I had to use in the Dublin airport (it is pretty challenging to get on and off an escalator while pulling and carrying the aforementioned articles with one good arm and the other arm in a sling) and I barely made the flight to Chicago. At no time during my frantic transfer through the Dublin airport, although I was clearly handicapped, did any member of the Aer Lingus ground crew offer any assistance. In fact, I don't remember any opportunities to ask any ground crew for assistance (after the initial refusal from the boarding attendant) as ground crew were largely non-existent. The flights themselves were pretty pleasant and I commend the pilots for smooth takeoffs and landings and flights. In-flight food was decent and flight attendants were businesslike and efficient. Don't use this airline if you need any assistance within the airport. They are clueless. I cannot give them a rating any higher than 2 because the lack of requested help within the airport almost caused me to further injure my shoulder.

### "do away with the Boeing 757"
Boston to Shannon. Aer Lingus needs to bring the A330 to/from Boston and do away with the Boeing 757. Boston is a very busy route for Aer Lingus travelers and having this Boeing 757 aircraft is a punishment. Absolutely no legroom on this single aisle aircraft. For a 5 hour flight from Boston and a 6.5 hour flight from Shannon flying this aircraft is torture. Service on board was very good on both directions with the flight attendants making sure the passengers were looked after well. There were several beverage service runs and constant delivery of water to all passengers. Aer Lingus flight attendants have always provided exceptional service on board. The downfall is the meal service was just average and they ran out of chicken before they reached our row (don't they have a passenger count of meals, not acceptable to run out of meals so quickly). Overall, both flights were excellent except for the legroom on the Boeing 757.

### "entertainment is totally inadequate"
Newark to Dublin with Aer Lingus. I normally fly with United on this route but changed to Aer Lingus recently when they started flying out of Newark as it was my impression that Aer Lingus generally provided a better flying experience. I was wrong. First, especially on an overnight flight, the constant intercom announcements for no good reason is annoying (e.g. announcing dimming cabin lights). The extra cost for their so called "Choice" seats in economy is definitely not worth it. Also their flight attendants are not adequately trained in how to get desired results. They came across to me as mini dictators. The entertainment system is totally inadequate in that the selection is substandard and limited.

### "best airline to London from Dublin"
Dublin to London Heathrow with Aer Lingus. The best airline to London from Dublin for a few reasons. Firstly they depart from T2 Dublin which is a better terminal than the old and scrubby T1. Secondly they arrive at T2 Heathrow which is a lot closer to the underground and bus terminal and main roads to London. Service friendly and accommodating but no free drinks compared to BA. Only disadvantage is that they only board from the front door compared to Ryanair who boards from both rear and front doors and subsequently board and depart quicker.

### "much to learn about customer service"
Manchester to New York JFK via Dublin. Very poor experience with ticketing and schedule changing. Aer Lingus changed my connecting flight a couple of times and finally cancelled this, meaning I'd not be able to make the transatlantic connection. Offered a full refund, but this hasn't arrived (a week later) and I've been told to expect 'at least 28 days' for this to happen. Aer Lingus customer services are impossible to reach on the phone and booking guys are not able to help. No offer of any assistance made to help us reach our destination other than to transfer to inconvenient flights. These guys have much to learn about customer service and I have made a note never to fly Aer Lingus again.

### "multitude of steep hidden fees"
London to Dublin with Aer Lingus. Multitude of steep hidden fees (particularly luggage fees) that are not mentioned during the initial booking process. $60 for 20kg, and that's half price because I booked online. Not at all nice to be slapped with that unexpectedly. Passed up a different flight because this one was cheaper - don't make my mistake.

### "FAs were simply amazingly"
Dublin to Toronto with Aer Lingus. Attempted to make changes to my reservation on the Aer Lingus web site - impossible. The online features are useless. Called the call centre to make a seat selection. I had to wait over 25 minutes before getting answered by someone who was not willing to help. Had a hard time understanding me, and nothing could be done. Not possible to add a frequent flyer program, not possible to make a seat selection for the return flight. At the airport, no one from the ground staff seemed to know which airline Aer Lingus cooperates with, as far as mileage accumulation. Qantas lists Aer Lingus as a partner on its website - so will try to handle later. The lounge in Dublin is spacious and well equipped. Good internet connection for work. The saving grace is the quality of the flight and inflight service. FAs were simply amazingly nice. The food and drinks were of quality and the seat quite comfortable. I used the single seat option available on this aircraft for rows 1 and 3. Arrival into Toronto was a bit delayed due to a delayed departure. Chaos to recover luggage at YYZ T3 - but that must be the airport's fault not the airline. Overall, if Aer Lingus fixes some issues with ground staff and call centre (more training required obviously), the product has great potential. Can't wait for them to rejoin Oneworld.

### "no one ever contacted us"
A few weeks ago I flew from Madrid to Louisville,  stopping first in Dublin and then Chicago before arriving at my final destination. All of the segments of the ticket were on one ticket and the whole ticket was under Aer Lingus and the last segment was under Aer Lingus but operated by United. My wife and I flew together and we each checked a second bag. We paid the fee for the second bag in Madrid but our bags were not checked all the way through even though we had one ticket. In Chicago we picked up our bags and went to recheck them at the United gate and they told us that United had no relationship with Aer Lingus,  and that as a result we would have to pay again. Basically they did not give us a choice, they said pay and go to the gate or go back to the international terminal and speak to Aer Lingus which would mean missing our flight. I can´t believe what happened. The next day we called and spoke to someone with Aer Lingus, gave all our information and receipt numbers and no one ever contacted us. So we called again and and again. My wife spoke to at least 4 different agents. One told her that other was dealing with our case and then another who she spoke to after, had no idea. Finally after about 6 phone calls and hours wasted she was told to send our receipts to prove that we were charged by both United and Aer Lingus. We´ve sent all this information on August 5th an till this day no one has even contacted us. Every time she called she would ask to speak to a supervisor, and was never aloud to speak to anybody apart from a regular agent who had no control over anything. Every time she spoke to an agent they would promise that someone would call and nobody has.

### "very poor on ground service"
Aer Lingus from Milan Linate to Dublin return. Check in at Milan Linate was one of the worst of my life. Very slow and with one employee that seemed to be drinking a cup of tea. The same staff, when we were still queuing, left because they finished the duty! !Aircraft clean with godd legroom, no free service on board. Check in in Dublin very confused with automatic machines and a few employees to help. All in all, Aer Lingus has been ok inflight but very poor on ground service.

### "cabin was spotless"
Dublin to Gatwick. Terminal 2 in Dublin is a superb new facility. I had to use and automated check-in system and an automated bag drop. This was tolerable but there were very few uniformed staff around and I saw elderly people and a young family struggling. Boarding was efficient with a female pilot and co-pilot who made clear announcements. The cabin crew were friendly and helpful and offered drinks and snacks for sale. The cabin was spotless and the use of the Irish language is appreciated. Leaving the flight was reasonable but one had to use a transfer bus followed by a series of staircases none of which would be suitable for elderly people. There were no staff at hand to help. I will happily fly Aer Lingus again.

### "you didn't win me over"
I was pleased to read that the airline had been upgraded to a 4* prior to departing, so I had high expectations of the flight. I liked the configuration of 2x4x2 as I was able to sit with my partner; I also liked to leg room available. The food was good, not a huge amount, but what we had was tasty. However, I object to being charged for alcoholic beverages and snacks. Surely if this airline wants to convey a 4* image this needs to go. The inflight entertainment was a joke, the touch screens are not responsive and the selection is poor. Staff are okay - better than my recent flight with United. Aer Lingus, you didn't win me over.

### "not trust them with checked bags"
Flew Aer Lingus from Amsterdam to Dublin this June. Flight experience was standard economy experience. No entertainment on EU flights and must pay for all beverages (even water) - pretty standard for a budget airline. Aer Lingus lost my checked bag at Dublin on flight arriving June 18. Despite submitting the appropriate documentation, now almost two months later, I did not receive reimbursement for my lost bag and am still waiting for a letter for my travel insurance stating that my bag was lost so that I can be reimbursed by them. It has been very time-consuming and overall terrible experience. After this experience I will never fly Aer Lingus again and would not trust them with checked bags.

### "very comfortable 2x2 seating"
Outbound flight with Aer Lingus crew and aircraft from Dublin to Bilbao. Slight delay on departure explained due to late arrival of aircraft from Düsseldorf. Flight very pleasant, seemed like a relatively new aircraft. Staff were friendly & engaging. Carry-on backpack but plenty of locker space despite it being a very busy flight. Food good & reasonably priced. Smooth landing into Bilbao. Return flight from Santiago to Dublin was operated by BA crew and BA Cityflyer Embraer aircraft with a very comfortable 2x2 seating configuration. Food was from buy onboard cart and opted for the tasty breakfast baguette. Crew pleasant and all-in-all a great flight home. Great job by both airlines.

### "couldn't rest properly"
We are a family of four (two adults and two children) and we were flying from Madrid to New York (with a 4-hour stop in Dublin). The flight was awful and the service was really bad. My seat was broken and two arm-rests too, we couldn't lift the arm-rests so that our children would be able to sleep more comfortably on this long flight. I called the flight attendant and she just told me that they were broken and she was very sorry. When food was served, we asked for chicken but we were told that they had run out of chicken and only had chilly beef. There were a lot of rows behind us so the rest of the passengers couldn't have chicken either. I can't eat beef because of my medical issues, and my children couldn't even take a bit of chilly beef as it was very spicy. When I asked the flight attendant to bring something at least for my children to eat, she said she told her supervisor about the problem but she/he said that they couldn't do it about it. Our children didn't eat anything and couldn't rest properly during the flight. We were very disappointed with the flight and the service.

### "great customer skills"
A really good flight to Gran Canaria from Dublin and return 2 weeks later with Aer Lingus. Treated with great customer skills from high quality staff - it knocks most "bucket and spade" flights out of the ring. It was a 4.5 hour flight, and we had to pay for food/drinks etc - but nevertheless it was better than most flights of its type.

### "would highly recommend"
My husband and I flew from Orlando to Dublin on Aer Lingus on 2 July last. Boarding was quick and the aircraft was clean and the crew welcoming when we boarded. The food was actually quite tasty and my duty free shopping was delivered to me promptly and within minutes of me ordering my items. My only complaint was that the arm rest in the middle of the two side seats does not lift up all the way so having the two seats to myself was of no benefits because of this, I understand this is most trivial but it would have been lovely to have been able to get a few hours sleep before we arrived in Dublin. We had some light breakfast and some much needed coffee. I would highly recommend Aer Lingus on this route and hope that sometime in the future they consider this small change in their aircraft as it would make flying much more comfortable for most of us.

### "displeased with this airline"
I booked my flight from Chicago to Geneva via Dublin in December 2015. I occasionally got reminder e-mails from the airline, and two days ago I received a "your trip is in two days" e-mail. Aer Lingus allows you to check in 24 hours before departure, and when i went on last night to check in it told me my returning flight had been cancelled and my connecting outbound flight in Dublin had be changed, creating a 7 hour layover when I originally had an 1h45 one. As soon as we saw this, we tried to call Aer Lingus but their hours of operation were over. We called as soon as possible the next morning, and they confirmed that my flight had been cancelled. They did not notify me of this prior to, and had I not tried to check in online ahead of time I wonder if I would have found out before leaving the US. They told me I could catch a flight from Dublin to Chicago on late in the day on July 30th, but my flight from Geneva to Dublin would still be on the early on the 29th. Hence, I would need to find transportation to and from a hotel. Both of these would not be covered by the airline. Otherwise they suggested booking a return flight through another airline. The only good thing was they offered us either a full refund if we decided to cancel, or half a refund if we decided to book another return flight. We found another round trip all together that leaves tomorrow (thank god) and were able to book that (although it did come with a much heftier price tag, but I would have paid it anyway with transportation and a hotel that extra night in Dublin) All in all, I am incredibly displeased with this airline.

### "staff were neatly presented and friendly"
This review relates to the return portion of a flight I made to Ireland to attend a funeral. Cork airport check-in was a pleasure to use as the staff were friendly and efficient and made a very professional first impression. The departure was on time and it was nice to hear the Captain use the Irish language. I had a comfortable seat and found the seating to be ideal for a relatively short flight of around 1 hour. Announcements were made during the flight and a range of snacks and other items were also available. The staff were neatly presented and friendly. I saw one male cabin crew member go out of his way to help an elderly lady. However, I also saw a female crew member stand by as another elderly lady struggled with her bag. I intervened and helped the elderly lady with her bag as the crew member looked on. Arrival was on time and there were no issues at all in disembarkation. I hope to use this airline again. However, as a QANTAS frequent flyer it was disappointing that I did not earn points on this flight.

### "cabin crew immaculate, polite and professional"
London Heathrow to Cork using the superb services of Aer Lingus to attend the funeral of my mother. I was very upset and a member of the cabin crew was very kind to me. The same cabin crew member was very helpful towards a young mum and baby too. The ground staff were very pleasant and professional and the cabin crew were immaculate and above all polite and professional in carrying out their duties. The flight left on time and the catering was fine. My only gripe was the steep price of the ticket.

### "pleasant and helpful"
Excellent Aer Lingus flight in all aspects. Great ground service in Dublin, comfortable seats, acceptable selection of food for a plane. Great that they have stated new Tuscan route, a more relaxing option than choosing Ryanair. On the return home slight delay but crew kept us informed and were so pleasant and helpful.

### "could do much better"
Flew Aer Lingus from Paris CDG to Dublin. I have no complaints about the flight apart from for the food. There was a short period where one could get something half decent (I seem to remember fruit salad). I ordered a cheese and coleslaw sandwich which was inedible (I'm not a fussy eater) and a coffee. I understand the constraints with pre-packed food but really they could do much better than this.

### "flights were excellent"
Flew Aer Lingus from Chicago to Naples with connection through Dublin. The flights were excellent. We thought the staff from check-in, flight attendants and particularly the handicap assistants were outstanding. The food was acceptable but were surprised that we had to pay for all drinks, even on the international leg. Our positive reactions were strained on our return flight from Dublin to Chicago. The flight attendants were more interested in their own interactions than customer service. The food was horrible. Limited beverage service with nothing but water during dinner service and only tea or coffee when given the boxed sandwich (poor quality). When my husband asked for a coke, was told that they ran out. Not acceptable!

### "pre-order option has vanished"
London Gatwick to Dublin. A pretty uneventful trip. Used and enjoyed the No1 Lounge beforehand which Aer Lingus uses for Gold Circle members, Nice hot food available and decent selection of drinks. Boarding delayed and a pretty full flight but the crew did well and every one was offered in flight service, although noticed that the pre-order option has now vanished. Seems to have been a development with security - I usually just travel with my driving licence on Aer Lingus flights from the UK to Ireland, on this occasion I was asked to show my boarding pass as a flight from Germany had also just landed at Passport control so I showed him it on my phone - I was advised that this was not acceptable as proof from where I had flown from, and the airlines were using it for their convenience. Eventually let me through but thought it might be worth flagging.

### "I still like to fly with them"
Dublin to Brussels on Aer Lingus 06.40 flight. Only gripe is checked in terminal 2 and was advised at checkin flight was to depart from terminal 1. A pleasnt flight, very nice crew, pre-ordered breakfast was served very promptly. The selection from the buy on board menu is really terrible, no fruit salads anymore, poor selection of sandwiches. I don't understand this as it's the one area an airline can boost its customer feel good appeal. I notice other travellers have been expressing similar views , but overall I still like to fly with them.

### "seats not very comfortable"
New York JFK to Dublin with Aer Lingus. All is low cost except the price. The entertainment system is old and the sound was not working. Seats are not very comfortable and food is a disaster. They should really update their planes with new Economy cabin and upgrade the food during the flight. Norwegian is better than Aer Lingus on long haul.

### "they offer no explanation"
My daughter (and her roommate) were stuck in Dublin on March 20 when a French air traffic control strike forced Aer Lingus to cancel their return flight from Dublin to Barcelona. Aer Lingus told them they had to stay in Dublin for at least 3 more days before the airline would be able to get them back to Barcelona. As that was not acceptable (they are students and had to get back to classes in Barcelona), I booked them on an Aer Lingus flight next morning (March 21) from Dublin to London Gatwick airport at a cost of $400 (each), and then on a flight from London Heathrow (a $70 taxi fare from Gatwick) to Barcelona on Iberia, at a cost of another $278 (each). Despite Aer Lingus's website saying under "Flight Disruption Info" that if flights are affected by a disruption, you can change your dates of travel free of charge and free of any fare difference, I have been unable to get Aer Lingus to refund any money at all. They offered to refund the unused portion of the round trip fare from Barcelona to Dublin (about US$120), but have not done so (it's been 2 months), and they offer no explanation why they will not honor the statement on their own website about allowing change in date and fare when there is a trip disruption. I'm not even asking them to refund the Iberia fare from London Heathrow to Barcelona, just the $400 I paid (times 2 for the two girls) for the fare from Dublin to London. Getting nowhere at all. Should I have the opportunity to fly into/out of Ireland in the future, I will never use Aer Lingus.

### "very poor quality"
Flew Aer Lingus from Dublin to San Francisco. The biggest downside is the food. Very poor quality. Only one meal was provided during the first 8 hours of the flight. No snacks or beverages provided without extra payment. Other than that the seats were comfortable with lots of leg space. Love wifi on board which helped me to be productive.

### "seats very comfortable"
San Francisco to Dublin with Aer Lingus. Very good aircraft. Seats were very comfortable with lot of space for legs. Short time waiting for boarding. Everything is perfect with Aer Lingus except for the food which in Economy class is of low level, especially breakfast and coffee.

### "terrible selection of food"
Faro to Belfast, and a terrible selection of food. Have used this airline for over 10 yrs with no issues as I'm a vegetarian. No veggie sandwich/toastie options, only a snack pack or scone which they ran out of before my row. I was in row 2! I travel with them several times a year and was so disappointed this time, never had any issues with my vegetarian needs before. No issues with flight or staff, they were as super as always.

### "courteous, friendly and helpful"
Birmingham to San Francisco via Dublin was my first international flight with Aer Lingus and I would fly with them again. I became aware of them by chance when seeking flights to San Fransisco to visit my daughter. Usually I fly from one of the London airports which is not very convenient, flying from Birmingham via Dublin with connecting flights was seamless with Aer Lingus. Another advantage was pre-clearing American Customs and Immigration at Dublin airport, again seamless and extremely well managed. The flight in economy was in my opinion as good, or better than other major carriers and the price was very competitive. I found Aer Lingus Staff, both on the ground and the cabin Staff to be courteous, friendly and helpful.

### "very good value"
Very nice flight from Leeds Bradford to Dublin. Left early and arrived early. Nice crew who were pleasant. Dublin Airport is very easy to manage. Would fly again as felt it was very good value and an easy company to deal with. I also noticed that check in at LBA was straightforward and I was through to departures with ease.

### "seats are very cramped"
Flew Aer Lingus from New York JFK to Shannon. The 757 product is not as good as the A330. The seats are very cramped and I'm only 5' 7" tall. The In-flight entertainment is sub-standard. Meal service starts in the front and rear of the aircraft, so you are stuck with chicken in the middle. The price was OK, but you get basic transportation to Shannon. Will try Delta, which flies a B767-400.

### "attendants were nice"
Flew Aer Lingus from London Heathrow to Belfast City. It was very timely getting on the aircraft, and the cabin was pretty empty when we were all on board. The luggage hold above the seats was incredibly cramped though. The ascent and descent were actually incredibly painful to the ears, and as it was such a short flight, there was no time for the ears to adjust. I do not know if this was a difficulty among everyone but as well as I, there were two ladies sitting to the left of me with the same difficulty. The attendants were nice, though, and there were plenty of food options, and although I didn't get anything, the ladies to my left did and it looked pretty good. It was, however, a relief to get off the plane.

### "always pleasant and helpful"
I have flown with Aer Lingus a few times to cross the Atlantic, the staff are always pleasant and helpful. The food and service is also great. Economy leg room isn't great but not the worst I have seen. The inflight entertainment on the aircraft I was on - EI-EWR was terrible, the videos constantly froze and didn't work at all which was a first for me as on other Aer Lingus planes I have been on the entertainment worked fine. The wifi service however did work fine during the flight, there was a slight interruption of coverage but it was fine otherwise. My flight was to Boston with Aer Lingus then onward to Detroit with JetBlue. I booked it all with Aer Lingus. Overall a great airline as expected from the national Irish airline.

### "cabin crew were pleasant"
Dublin to Chicago with Aer Lingus. Excellent service from check-in at Dublin T2 through to arrival at Chicago. US Preclearance at Dublin ensured a prompt stopover at ORD before connecting onward to YYZ. The cabin crew were pleasant and accommodating. The entertainment selection was adequate for the short trip across the Atlantic. Food and beverage service excellent. I would definitely fly with Aer Lingus in the future when traveling from Europe to North America.

### "food menu much improved"
Recently travelled Cork to Malaga return. Ground staff service good, flights were punctual and the cabin staff friendly and helpful. Was in row 1 and had the usual hassle with lack of space in overhead lockers although the relatively new concept of priority boarding was a help. You still had to get onboard first to get to the lockers, there is very little row 1 locker space. Flight deck kept us up to date during the flight. New food menu much improved. Baggage retrieval at both ends quick and efficient.

### "a wonderful experience"
Liverpool to Dublin with Aer Lingus. Can't express enough my thanks and appreciation for making my first ever flight such a wonderful experience. The cabin crew were excellent and once they found out it was my first flight at the age of 71, they went out of their way to offer me reassurance. They even offered me a local newspaper and provided me with a glass of proseco. I would highly recommend the cabin crew and Aer Lingus for their professionalism and making my journey pleasurable.

### "crew were very good"
Flew Aer Lingus from Dublin to Madrid to Dublin, Feb 5-7th. Flights were packed but I was delighted to see the introduction of "priority boarding" which comes if you purchase certain seats at the time of booking, found it very handy. Crew were very good on both flights, however the new in-flight menu has virtually nothing on it, no fruit salad and my colleague who is vegetarian could order nothing. Both flights were virtually on time, but it would be worth it if Aer Lingus reviewed their in-flight buy on board menu - remember Ireland has a weath of culinary riches.

### "staff very professional"
Our flight was with Aer Lingus from Dublin to London Heathrow, they were brilliant with my son, who is an adult on the autism spectrum, so he was happy just to be on the plane. The seats were very comfortable for an A320. Loved that they played good music whilst we were waiting and the captain kept us up to date as to when we would leave. Inflight the food service was good, staff very professional and made you feel welcome on board. I would fly with them again.

### "chewing gum and dressed scruffy"
London Heathrow to Cork. What a disappointment! After travelling half way around the world, being exposed to some super airport and inflight service, to finish our journey on our own countries carrier Aer Lingus, should have been great, how wrong we were. Staff at the check in desk chewing gum and dressed scruffy set the tone, very poor. Called to check in and then made stand for 40 minutes just past the check in desk? Why check in passengers and make them stand in a small area, when the plane hasn't disembarked it's previous passengers? This shows a total lack of regard for the elderly, people not in full health and people completing long journeys. After 40 minutes of standing we went back past the check in area to the seats so the kids could sit comfortably and complained to Aer Lingus staff, not that they seemed to care as they were to interested in chatting amongst themselves. And why does it take 6 staff to check in a small plane? Unfortunately things on the plane weren't much better, poorly dressed staff looking tired and rough, we couldn't understand the lady on the mic reading the safety statement, neither could the girl demonstrating this as they were in and out of sync, lack of professional refreshment service provided as the first thing they were asked for off the menu seemed to confuse the stewardess and she dissappeared for a while and returned with a no we don't have that. It was only a sandwich that was requested by another passenger. Obviously there are good staff with Aer Lingus also, but this is spoilt by a poor few and bad practices. I would recommend management in Aer Lingus should get on a Singapore Airlines flight to see how it should be done, very well dressed staff throughout a long flight, very attentive and polite to any need or request, each one of them asked the name of our kids and used it when talking to them (Aer Lingus staff didn't bother to ask, the chewing gum was obviously in the way), very well organised at check in time even though dealing with a great deal more passengers and it didn't take six of them to do it either! Come on Aer Lingus staff you can do much better than this, and it wouldn't take much, just a better regard for your customers and some manners.

### "never trust Aer Lingus"
We, a family of 5 including 2 children and an infant, was supposed to fly from Toronto to Kochi via Dublin. Toronto to Dublin leg was to be on Aer Lingus. When we reached the Airport to Check in, the agent said that we could not fly, because the flight was cancelled and asked us to call their booking agent to rebook our tickets. Their agent, after hours of waiting, said that she has booked us on Emirates for the next day. So we went home. Then when we checked the Emirates site, there was no such booking. We called up Emirates and they said that, Aer Lingus had only made a reservation but had not ticketed it, so it got cancelled automatically. So we tried calling Aer Lingus again and after hours of being on hold, Aer Lingus finally said that we were booked on Air Canada for Jan 8th. So we went to the Airport and at the check in counter, the agent said that she could not find a ticket for our baby. So Aer Lingus, when re-issuing our ticket had re-issued only 4 tickets instead of 5 and had missed out on our infant. So we called them again to try to fly on the next flight, but they said that they could not do anything. Then we again went home at 10.30pm with the 3 children and all the luggage. The whole night we kept trying to call Aer Lingus and finally in the morning, they said that we had to buy a fully fresh ticket for our baby and that they would reimburse it. So we went to our agent to buy the ticket and somehow they fixed our infant's ticket for us. But later while returning, when we checked with Etihad, our original carrier, they said that Aer Lingus would not have been able to reimburse the ticket fare, since it is not their ticket that we are buying - and it is Air Canada's ticket. So even that was cheating from the side of Aer Lingus. So my personal advice to anyone out there is to never trust or travel on Aer Lingus.

### "cabin crew were brilliant"
Manchester to Dublin return on A320/ATR 72 (ops by Stobart Air). Outbound was on time with friendlyish crew. Had seat 11A which ended up with 3 seats to myself on the row. Seats were comfy but seat belt was quiet small. Cabin was filthy with coffee cups and sugar sachets on the floor and in the seat pockets. Good, regular updates from the pilots and landed a few minutes early. Return was on the ATR - just 2 cabin crew who were brilliant. Had seat 7F which was bigger than I thought and a proper sized seatbelt! Just watch your head as the cabin isn't the tallest! Paid £35 return for the day. Usually choose Ryanair for £19.90 return but wanted to try EI for a change so for the extra £15 it was worth a gamble.

### "minimal legroom"
Some really good and some really awful aspects to this journey with Aer Lingus from Heathrow to Belfast. Good things included the Aer Lingus lounge in T2 which was open to me because of my BAEC membership. The lounge is quiet and well appointed, making it a perfect spot to wait for the flight. Second good point is the cabin crew who were excellent. The bad bits - the mobile app for choosing a seat and retrieving a boarding pass. Second bad thing is the seating which is tightly stacked together for minimal legroom whilst the backrest is inclined at an unusually low angle. This combination pushes the whole lower part of the body forward and this further exacerbates the lack of legroom. Aer Lingus could be a great airline if they just sorted out some niggles, especially their mobile app.

### "customer service is horrific"
Decent airline with friendly, helpful cabin crew and ground staff. Have flown with them extensively throughout Europe for work (so lots of commuter flights) - generally never had a problem. But their reservations dept and customer service is horrific. They made a mistake and over-charged me on a reservation late last year. Despite acknowloging that it was their mistake, they never once reached out to me to resolve it. I had to chase them up with 4 or 5 calls over a period of 1 month and still the problem was not resolved. It's the low-cost mentality - the customer service reps I spoke to on the phone told me they are not allowed to return calls or even send emails, and each time when I pushed on this issue (that I should not have to chase them up for their mistake) the response was that maybe someone would get in touch in a couple of days. When I asked to speak with a manager, I was told each time that none was available. I was repeatedly told me to wait a week and then call them back to see if it was resolved. There is also no way to escalate an issue. I tried sending a complaint via email and a month later got a generic response along the lines of "blah blah blah, verz sorry, blah blah, hope you will fly with us in the future" and yet they did nothing to resolve the issue (they even managed to address the email to the wrong person. The way they handled me puts me off ever wanting to fly with them again. I am 700 Euros out of pocket because of it. To be fair, they offer a decent product for the price, but on the rare situation where you might have a problem I doubt you could get worse service, even from Ryanair / Spirit.

### "very good for price paid"
Dublin to Chicago with Aer Lingus. Business class product very good for price paid. Food and service excellent. Clearing US immigration at Dublin makes a big difference as you land as a domestic passenger and are outside terminal in a few minutes. Would recommend this airline.

### "airlines have such inconsistency"
It's a shame Aer Lingus are coming off this route soon, as they provide an efficient and friendly service at keen prices from London Gatwick to Belfast City Airport. Both flights out and back departed early and arrived early. Outbound seat 15F was not good, with very poor legroom, like a Low Cost Carrier. On the return, on the very same aircraft EI-EPT, seat 8A was much better, with roughly 3 inches more legroom. I can’t understand why airlines have such inconsistency. Onboard catering has to be purchased, and £1.90 for a still water to take my medication with was shameful.

### "overall was very easy"
I flew with Aer Lingus when I had booked my flight with SAS from Stockholm to London, and from there, I flew with Aer Lingus to Dublin. Very friendly staff, I asked a few questions and it was no problem there. The journey overall was very easy. I traveled without any checked in baggage.

### "routine and unremarkable"
Dublin to Geneva, returning Zurich to Dublin with Aer Lingus. Outbound was mid-week mid-morning, and about 50% full. Entire experience was routine and unremarkable. The return flight was full and on-time. Check-in was poorly handled in Zurich with too few staff for the first hour leading to a long and frustrating queue. There were also quite a number of food items sold out on this return leg, otherwise a satisfactory flight.

### "a great airline"
New York to Shannon with Aer Lingus, and a great airline. A very friendly crew and advance reservation meal service very important for those with food allergies. The website is good, could be updated but in all a great service. The rates are competitive. I made the mistake of leaving a medical device in the overhead compartment and the Aer Lingus staff made sure I received it quickly. These folks understand what customer service is!

### "experience was absurd"
The pre-trip Aer Lingus service was terrible. Flight details were entered incorrectly, yet they would not accommodate. Firstly I was continually told that someone would call me back within the day. They wouldn't and I would call again only to be told someone would call me. Again they would not. This happened 6 times. Then they insisted on charging $600 change fee (plus other flight costs) to correct flight to the one we wanted. Would come to over $1,000 to make the trip. They would not budge at all or even accommodate in any way despite that clearly this was a simple mistake. Never resolved. The entire experience was absurd and maddening.

### "experience was very good"
Paris CDG to Chicago via Dublin with Aer Lingus. Seats were a bit uncomfortable, the plane was old from the outside but pretty new on the inside for the A330, the A320's are a bit old and smelly. The overall experience was very good and the Dublin airport is very well organised. The cabin crew was very nice too.

### "go through immigration in DUB"
Boston to Barcelona via Dublin with Aer Lingus. The food was rather limited and not a decent amount of it. The staff varies a lot, some are friendly some are not, so just hope to be lucky. Seat was okay for transatlantic flight and enough legroom. Dublin connection was the very best experience, because you go through immigration in DUB, so no need to undergo those big lines when you get to the US.

### "won't be flying with them"
Never got a chance to fly with them on planned Boston to Vienna via Dublin trip. I had a family emergency, booked through American Express and when I asked for a voucher, credit, refund or even a portion they told me I needed to pick a date right away for when I want to go to Europe - obviously wasn't able to do that fast. Its a big trip. Ended up with nothing and wasted $865. No call, no email or anything. I won't be flying with them ever.

### "most seats have aisle access"
I find Aer Lingus business class really good across the Atlantic, spoilt in some parts by turbo prop connecting flights. Most business seats have aisle access. Food and good quality service makes a difference. From the UK mainland they are consistently cheaper. Other advantage is clearing US immigration and customs at Dublin which means at US destination you can be kerbside quickly.

### "not expecting a charge for coffee "
London to Belfast flight with Aer Lingus was affordable and cheaper than most flights in the States. However, the legroom for a 6'3" man was not good. Felt squeezed in and had to twist around to get in and out of seat. The flight was relatively empty. Airline could remove a row or two and give everyone a few more inches. I was also not expecting a charge for coffee or a soft drink. Those beverages are customarily complimentary in the States.

### "fairly well priced"
Aer Lingus from Chicago to London Heathrow via Dublin having flown on the outbound flight in December. All flights were comfortable, on time and the service on the ground and in the air was pretty good. The check in at Chicago had no queue and staff were friendly and polite. Plenty of drinks served (all alcoholic beverages are chargeable which makes them appear more of a budget airline). Planes in good condition and seat space was good. -Inflight entertainment was limited. There was a limited collection of movies (some new releases) and screen size was quite small. However good headphones provided and good music. A330's have wifi which was a decent connection, but costs a fair bit and severely limits the data you have available. The online check in is useless. There were three of us flying. It showed no availability for seats (other than once available for upgrade). We booked through expedia but individuals booking through Aer Lingus can select the seats and all others have to wait until check in. As a result, on the outbound leg, we didn't all sit together. They mucked up our meals on the inbound leg from Chicago to Dublin. We requested vegetarian meals on the return leg. However none were available. The crew instead gave a small basket of fruits as a substitute that was wholly inadequate. So if you have a meal request, make sure you are travelling with some food (or confirm at check in). In general however, food was of average quality on the way out. The flight was fairly well priced for the time of the year though so can't complain too much.

### "worst airline I've flown"
Gatwick to San Francisco via Dublin and Aer Lingus are the worst airline I've flown. From a shoddy website and customer contact numbers pre-flight (no way to check in) to having a bassinet seat for our baby on the plane, which once in place meant we couldn't get in or out of the seats or access our tray tables or TV. Food on the flight that could only be described as disgusting and a non existent drinks service (on a 11 hour flight!). Rude check in staff at London Gatwick and to top it all off, losing all the luggage from passengers connecting through Dublin back to London Gatwick (and apparently the Manchester flight too) from SFO. The lost baggage took over 2 hours in the airport to sort out (took an hour to find someone to help us). We were never contacted with reference numbers to track our baggage and the Aer Lingus duty manager at Gatwick was rude with no clear explanations of what was happening or what the process was to get our baggage back. We are still waiting for information as to when our luggage will be reunited to us.

### "I'll avoid Aer Lingus"
Dublin to Lisbon. I usually fly based on the cheapest ticket price and that usually is not Aer Lingus - but on this trip they were the only choice so I was looking forward to the experience. Big mistake. Aircraft on outbound flight had not been cleaned. Dirt and leftovers in seat pocket. Seat needed replacement. Staff like a group of teenagers (and believe me they were not) catching up with the latest gossip. Badly groomed and tired looking. Inflight food mediocre and pricey. Return flight much the same. Tray table dirty. Staff like a group of giggling teenagers with each other, and a pack of defensive sourpusses when dealing with customers. Unexplained delay at Dublin waiting for the airbridge and when it did arrive no announcement to that effect. Passengers standing in aisle, overhead bins emptied, heat increasing, babies crying - you get the picture? Staff seemed oblivious. Although not their fault, at least interact with their customer and keep them updated. I'll avoid Aer Lingus at all costs in the future.

### "a careless attitude"
Aer Lingus are never proactive with complaints as they live in the past of customer service market thinking they can do No wrong! So do not expect to get a reply or remedy! Yesterday, 26th December, started off with rude check in staff accusing me of jumping the line. I had lined up as requested and was sent to this ticket agent and had to argue why I was at this desk. Finally the agent conceded to check me in. I had only carry on luggage. Terminal 2 was busy and there was restaurant trash piled up everywhere, which is very unhygienic. Gate agents were unfriendly and when asked questions about customs in Toronto were unable to answer these questions, although on the Toronto route service. The aircraft had a musty urine smell which had to be endured for 7 hours. Toilets were poorly maintained which probably added to the problem. Meal service was poor with 30 to 40 mins between a drink and meal. The flight attendant forgot to give us a meal and eventually we got leftover trays without full content of meal on tray. The meal was in poor condition to be serviced. Very poor. A sandwich would have been more welcome. Cabin crew were junior and had a careless attitude. Valet hand luggage got checked with "check-in" luggage. This messed up my travel plans. I was told that my bag would be at the gate at time of disembarkation but instead I had to go to the baggage claim to retrieve my luggage. I am a seasoned traveler and have decades of travel under my belt both for business and pleasure. But this flight experience was an all time low. Delta will be getting my business fron now on.

### "fairly comfortable"
Flew Aer Lingus from Dublin to Zurich. Reasonable fare, booked many months ahead, but charged for baggage and food. Check-In was fast in Dublin but a bit chaotic in Zurich. Both flights on time and fairly comfortable. Snacks reasonably priced. The experience was professional, competent and unhurried.

### "cabin was filthy"
Check-in at EDI was a bit of a hassle, since there was only one person assigned to check in a flight full of holiday passengers with holiday luggage. Our regional flight from Edinburgh to Dublin was delayed, which caused us inexplicably, given our itinerary and the time we arrived to the airport in the first instance, to nearly miss our long haul to O'Hare. Security and US Pre-Clearance in Dublin were a horror show (not the airline's fault), which is all to say that we were already quite flustered by the time we boarded. This airline used to provide quality service and decent in flight amenities, but they've cancelled their complimentary bar service on international flights (and all complimentary beverage service on regional flights), and the food was markedly poorer than in the past. We received about a quarter of a cup of water with our meal, and tea service was impossibly bad. Entertainment was mediocre. Add to this the fact that cabin crew was also noticeably stressed and you have a recipe for an all-around poor flight experience. I overheard one cabin attendant say that he was looking forward to a day off, and I don't blame him. The cabin of the plane (A330) was filthy and poorly maintained. My son's seat came apart during the flight, and the lavatory looked and smelled as though it hadn't been cleaned properly. We fly from Edinburgh to the States with some frequency, and we've always chosen, if possible, an Aer Lingus flight on this route, which used to be consistently friendly, efficient, and pleasant. My understanding is that the IAG (British Airways, etc) acquired Aer Lingus - well, they've absolutely trashed it.

### "very good experience"
Recently booked a return trip from Shannon to Boston for a short visit to the US, Aer Lingus was the best priced and the benefit of a direct service. Check in was quick and efficient (there was only one person ahead of me); security at Shannon was quiet and I was through security within 15 minutes, another benefit was the US pre clearance which saves time and hassle on arrival. The flight was on a Boeing 757-200 in a 3x3 configuration, seats were comfortable and a decent choice of movies and shows. Soon after takeoff a drinks service was offered (they charge for alcoholic drinks), followed by the meal. I upgraded my meal on the way out, which is worth the extra money as you are served first, the meal was served on china and included a bottle of wine. Tea and Coffee is served in paper cups, which is a big improvement over the light plastic cups they used to use. Prior to landing a snack was served, which again has improved since I last used this route. The cabin crew were polite and friendly and made passes through the cabin throughout the flight. Arrival was ahead of time into Boston, however the new arrival process (which looks and I hope is temporary) is a bit of a maze through the terminal. Overall a very good experience with Aer Lingus.

### "fantastic cabin attendants"
Recently flew from BOS to SNN rountrip economy class. Excellent flight with fantastic cabin attendants, always ready to be of help. Throughout the flight the attendants constantly moved up and down the aisle checking on their passengers. Food was very good and seats quite comfortable. I'm not a great fan of the Boeing 757, but the configuration used by Aer Lingus was very spacious. Aer Lingus is always my first choice when crossing the Atlantic.

### "seat comfy when reclined"
Dublin to New York JFK with Aer Lingus. The seat is comfy when reclined, and is good for relaxing, but when you have the seat in the take off and landing position, it rocks a bit and almost feels unsecure which did not make me at ease. There was free wifi and the flight crew were very polite but lacked character and seemed to be more focused on being efficient and not engaging in a proper chat. The inflight entertainment was dire. The annoying thing was that on the way back there was a much better selection of films, but as a night flight I had to sleep. Food was not too fancy but it tasted great, they were lacking a bit on drinks, specifically champagne. I would have liked a wider seat and larger duvets, as I found them to be too small. Overall Aer Lingus offers an amazing business class product if prices are taken into consideration.

### "Great way to the US"
Gatwick to Chicago via Dublin. As a regular flier to Chicago from London, Aer Lingus is a great option. Short flight to Dublin was fine. Easy connection and pre-clearance at Dublin. A330 has very comfortable lie flat seats in 1-2-1 configuration. Lots of personal space and cabin less crowded than the equivalent BA club product. IFE very good, but movie choice a bit limited. Cabin crew very friendly, attentive and provided excellent service. Food and wine excellent. Difficult to fault and the fares are generally much cheaper than BA. And in flight wifi too, enabling me to post this review from somewhere over Canada! Aer Lingus and its Dublin hub deserve to succeed. Great way to travel to the US.

### "crew friendly and chatty"
Manchester to Chicago via Dublin with Aer Lingus. Best value transatlantic business class. Flat bed seats, sufficient entertainment options, really good food and champagne. Outbound crew a little stand-offish, and the cabin wasn't clean - found someone's sock at my seat. The return crew were friendly and chatty and landed feeling thoroughly looked-after. Also, free wi-fi was welcome. The lounge at Dublin is not up to par with other transatlantic business class standards, feeling more like a regional pay-per-use lounge than a main hub. The inflight experience was competitive.

### "don't believe Aer Lingus"
Don't believe Aer Lingus if they say they will refund any costs for a cancelled flight! Fog caused cancelled flight (not their fault) but from there on service was atrocious! Kept waiting at the airport for 2 hours until someone said what would happen, then offered a taxi home (great!). However when I tried to reclaim the costs got the following response. Aer Lingus will not cover accommodation or transport costs if a Guest opts for a refund following a flight cancellation. This will apply only if the Guest retains their booking, and reschedules for a later date. £275 taxi costs now borne by my company - its a joke! Shame I cant give a minus number.

### "next trip will not be Aer Lingus"
New York JFK to Dublin return. We always enjoyed flying Aer Lingus to Dublin almost once a year, and went out of our way to book it. We paid an extra USD240 round trip to get extra leg room. They had reconfigured the seating and I could not straighten my legs out and the seats were narrower. The cabin crew was rude and sounded like a bunch of teenagers when hanging out in the galley after lights went out. I complained to Aer Lingus on 16 October and received a confirmation number. I have not heard anything since. Next year's trip will not be booked on Aer Lingus.

### "the experience was terrible"
Flew back to the US with Aer Lingus. Once I heard they were re-instating their direct service to Ireland from SFO, I was very happy. Unfortunately the experience was terrible. Outbound to Ireland, both mine and my wife's seats were faulty and my inflight entertainment screen was loose and would not hold position for best viewing especially when the passenger in front reclined. Mentioned it to staff, no adaquate response or help. Inbound to SFO it was the same aircraft, no high expectations then. Again our seates were both faulty, I could not stop the recline on mine so at take off, I was in the guy's lap who was sitting behind me, very safe! Again, no empathy or even a free beverage from staff who really could not care less. Aer Lingus need to upgrade their service and aircraft, Next time I'll take the inconvenience of making a connection, versus flying an old, unmaintained aircraft. Aer Lingus do not know what type of service they're offering, it's not low fares, nor is it standard like most other transatlantic carriers.

### "recommend if you get a good deal"
Dublin to New York JFK return in business class was an excellent experience. Food very good, crew very pleasant, seat was very comfortable and good for sleeping. The only downside are the Aer Lingus lounges both in Dublin and JFK. The lounge food offerings were not great particularly in Dublin, in JFK you can pre-dine, however the food on board was far superior to the pre-dine option. Would recommend if you book well in advance and get a good deal.

### "regret that I am flying with them"
London to Chicago via Dublin. I actually haven't flown with Aer Lingus yet and I regret that I am flying with them. My ticket is a part of a multi city itinerary and I  am disappointed with my online travel agent for using them. One gets suspicious when you have to pay for alcoholic beverages and extra snacks. No wonder Aer Lingus is pushing a business class seat onto me. They only have a 20kg baggage allowance as opposed to Emirates and Qantas the other airlines I'll be with.

### "worst international flight experience"
Worst international flight experience ever. Unhelpful staff, terrible food and an additional charge for drinks (something I've never experienced on any other international flight). At one point on the return journey I asked an air hostess for a blanket. She told me to go search for one myself on one of the empty seats. It was dark onboard and I couldn't see a thing. I again went to ask another air hostess for a blanket and she also told me to look myself. When I explained it was dark and I didn't want to go rummaging around peoples seats she went to look but had a terrible attitude. They had the same limited movie/tv selection on the return flight as the flight over. I have never felt compelled to write a review of a service before, but I feel others should know before booking how below standard Aer Lingus are when compared to other airlines. I would definitely recommend going for Virgin atlantic or British Airways. If you're travelling from Ireland, this will mean getting a connecting flight from London. But it is worth it if you value comfort on a long haul flight.

### "underwhelmed with Aer Lingus"
I am very underwhelmed with Aer Lingus. I have flown international a few times and this is the first time we had to purchase a glass of wine and pay for coffee! Then the worst came when we very unfortunately missed our flight from Rome to Dublin because of a massive traffic jam getting to the airport. I can't tell you the stress we were under and we tried over and over to call customer service, we were on hold without ever getting through. We were using precious cell phone minutes with no luck. Once we got to the airport, the counter was closed, we tried again, over and over to call, still no luck. So there we were with 4 adult flights that couldn't be honored. We had to rebook on another airline and spend another 10 hours via Germany to get to Dublin. This was at a great cost to us. We had a baby with us and my husband with a very serious heart condition. It was a very difficult situation which was made worse to not be able to communicate with anyone from Aer Lingus. If it were not for the help of a woman at the airport in Rome who finally connected with someone, we were told we were out luck. There's one flight out of Rome and tough luck if you miss it! Then once we were in Ireland and needing to check in, it was impossible. The website was difficult and again we couldn't get through to customer service. My daughter probably spent a few hours on the phone without ever reaching anyone. This is so unacceptable. I have been on buses that were more comfortable! I'm sorry for all my complaints but Aer Lingus did not make traveling very enjoyable.

### "would fly them again"
Boston to Dublin with Aer Lingus. Everything was standard for a coach seat. We paid extra to get a better seat location but there was no more leg room than usual. Flight was on time both ways. Service was a little slow but overall a good experience. I would fly them again and recommend.

### "doubt I would fly again"
I flew return Dublin to Brussels, having flown with Aer Lingus many times previously and have been happy with the service before, however this time I was extremely disappointed. We arrived at Dublin airport around 5am and there were long lines for the Aer Lingus check-in desk even though we had checked in online we were shown to the main queue. A member of my group was using crutches and so standing in the line was uncomfortable. A member of Aer Lingus staff who was directing passengers to the various desks was extremely rude an was shouting at many of the passengers. We had pre-booked assistance for the member of our group using crutches but we asked the at the check-in desk there were steps to the plane - to which she told us that it was definitely an air bridge to the plane so accessibility wouldn't be an issue. We arrived at the gate to find that there was no air bridge to the plane and there was stairs down to the tarmac. To which a lady here was helpful but the member requiring assistance would have to wait behind. When the other staff scanned the passports there was a computer issue with one which the staff couldn't figure out. As my passport already scanned and I waited for my family member I was rudely told to "Just go and board the plane!". As I went down the stairs I was met by several different doors/corridors with no signage or member of staff to point us in the correct direction. After spending several minutes lost, myself and a few other passengers finally made it to the tarmac where two members of Aer Lingus ground staff were standing chatting then were again somewhat rude while taking us to the steps. Onboard we waited for the member of our group who required the assistance to get on to the plane. As she made her way down the aisle to sit beside us, she was told to "just sit there" in a row by herself about 5 rows away from us. Because she was not seated beside us we were not able to help getting bags/crutches from the overhead locker and no staff helped. The return flight was no improvement on Aer Lingus part. As the flight was full we couldn't place the crutches in the locker, after trying to get the attention of the crew and being ignored, my family member had to sit with the crutches upright in front of her for the whole journey - which wasn't even remarked upon by cabin crew doing the usual "tray up, bags away safety check". Furthermore, staff were extremely rude. As this flight was departing late in the evening and was delayed a lady in the seat across the aisle from me had fallen asleep before takeoff. A male crew member then proceeded to stop during the safety demonstration, stomp over to her, nip her arm and shake her quite aggressively, rudely telling her pay attention! I was shocked and the lady seemed upset at this. After years of happily flying Aer Lingus I doubt I would again unless no other alternative.

### "passengers seriously affected"
Aer Lingus EI120 scheduled for departure Saturday 14th November at 2045. Cancelled at 1am due to APU problem. Re scheduled as EI1120 for Sunday 15th at 2359! Cancelled again around 2am. Replacement Aer Lingus aircraft arrived via Boston with a scheduled departure as EI2120 at 2000hrs. Finally departed 2115 Monday 16th. Nearly 300 passengers seriously affected. Aer Lingus communications consisted of one email and one text over 3 days. Had to phone Aer Lingus in New York for updates. Passengers are entitled to compensation for cancelled flights under EC 261/2004, with flights over 3500km results in compensation of €600 per cancellation.

### "such horrible treatment"
I flew Aer Lingus from San Francisco to Venice via Dublin return. I have flown most of the major airlines and I never experienced such horrible treatment, especially on transatlantic flights. When I got in my seat for the Venice to Dublin flight there was a paper cup left in the pocket from the previous traveler. On the flight from Dublin to SFO, a 10.5 hour flight, I was given a meal in the first hour of the flight and what might be considered a sandwich the last hour. In between the cabin crew turned into concession sales people peddling the most atrocious snacks. After the initial beverage service the cabin crew did not come around once to offer water. If you wanted water you had to go to the "concession stand" and ask for it. Then, I received a feedback survey from Aer Lingus and the survey didn't come up. It read could not find the server. Nice to know that they really don't want to know how their service is, with the way they run their airline. I wouldn't want to know either, unless I was really interested in improving.

### "business class seats are great "
Chicago to Dublin with Aer Lingus in Business class. Excellent service from attentive cabin crew, food and beverages were excellent. The new business class seats are great and recline flat so a decent sleep can be had. Wifi worked and at a decent speed throughout flight. Only criticism is the number of movies and TV shows available on IFE. Choice seemed limited

### "no email received"
Aer Lingus flight EI120 from Orlando to Dublin due to leave Orlando on Saturday 14th Nov at 2045 cancelled due to technical problem and the crew going out of hours. Passengers put up in hotels between 4 and 5 am! Aer Lingus issued email on Sunday morning 15th Nov stating the flight would depart Orlando at 2045 on 15th Nov. However on looking at the Aer Lingus flight information page it stated the flight would now depart at 2359. Flight is now EI1120 (original flight number EI120). No email received about this change. Dublin Airport arrivals information has the arrival of EI1120 for 0950 - this being the original scheduled time for EI120? Got onto Aer Lingus in New York and it was confirmed the time of departure from Orlando is 2359. But any mention of the flight has disappeared from the Aer Lingus flight information page! Why? In this day of instant communications Aer Lingus has shown itself to be rather pathetic and they obviously did not communicate the revised departure to Dublin Airport flight information people. I hope passengers realise they are entitled to compensation of €600 under EU rules.

### "another enjoyable flight"
Dublin to Boston return with Aer Lingus. Immigration pre clearance in Dublin a big plus. Boarding procedures strictly but pleasantly enforced. Outbound flight delayed due to removal of unruly passenger by 45 mins. Flight not full so plenty of space as adjacent seat not occupied. Seating typical for economy, would have felt cramped if flight was full. Booked fillet steak meal for additional 25 euro. Well worth it and thoroughly enjoyed. Crew were friendly and efficient. Arrived in Boston slightly ahead of schedule. Only issue I had was on arrival. Passengers arrive into airside departure area of Logan airport and it was confusing where to go to exit. On return check in took minutes and security was not too busy despite all the usual demeaning orders from homeland security. Flight home also half empty so plenty of space to stretch out. Even slept for 2 hours. Crew friendly and efficient. Upon landing in Dublin only had to wait about 5 minutes to get bag. Well done Aer Lingus. Another enjoyable flight.

### "flights are always late"
Staff turned up late at the gate and then proceeded to get people to check their hand luggage in, and they could get on the plane first. Those who had paid priority and club class had to wait. Plane loads from front only so therefore the flights are always late as no one seems to have the time or inclination to do anything about it. Usual bad manners from some other passengers. To be frank no different from Ryanair. Room for improvement.

### "will use this service again"
Birmingham to Orlando via Dublin. Travelled with Aer Lingus several times in the last couple of months. The crew are polite, happy and offer good quality service. We chose the upgrade food on both flights and both hot and delicious and snacks on arrival. One good thing is the service at Dublin for pre clearance is fantastic, waiting time 6 minutes. Overall excellent will use this service again.

### "no space to eat it"
New York JFK to Rome via Dublin. We had a third party lounge available to wait out the 2+ hours until departure. We arrived at the gate as they were just boarding. Things went smoothly. We had ordered the Bia upgraded dinner and were concerned that the flight attendants wouldn't have a clue. About 40 minutes after takeoff they came by with trolleys and identified us as having ordered special meals (hooray!) which they served promptly. The food was good. Problem was there was no space to eat it! We were literally doing yoga - one of us would cut the meat and while they were eating it the other would cut theirs. I mentioned to the FA when they were serving drinks that we had ordered the special Bia meal that came with wine. So, she gave me one. There just wasn't enough space to enjoy it in the seat we were in.

### "may as well have been Ryanair"
Toronto to London via Dublin. I was looking forward to this flight. Transatlantic flight with a national carrier and an Irish one no less, sounded great. I may as well have been on Ryanair. Sorry, but a transatlantic flight with a national carrier should offer free stuff including the odd beer in my opinion - call me old fashioned but there you go. Very average meal, no free drinks. Won't be flying with Aer Lingus again. Cabin crew were polite enough, but the trip was terrible in comparison to British Airways and Emirates flights I have taken.

### "a do it yourself clean"
I traveled from Amsterdam to Dublin on the 3rd November and it was the most revolting experience! Aircraft a relatively new looking Airbus A320 was filthy on boarding. I was greeted at my seat by used newspapers, a coffee cup and sweet wrappers all over the seat. The seat pocket was overflowing with rubbish. When I moved the rubbish and dropped the tray table it looked as if a child had emptied an entire carton of ribena all over it, it was sticky and there was no way that anybody could use it. I had paid 435 euro for the flight, so its not as if it was cheap. I thought the cleaners must have missed a row. I alerted one of the flight attendants, who informed me that Aer Lingus have decided to remove cleaning? They were very apologetic, but had stated they had received numerous complaints already from their new policy. I travel weekly for business and use numerous different airlines and have always regarded Aer Lingus as a good quality carrier. It was never a first class experience, but it was never dirty and off putting. However I do expect to be able to sit down without having to wade through rubbish and use my laptop on the tray table without having the remnants of the previous flight on it. I travel frequently with Easyjet and Ryanair and even their aircraft are in a better state. Shame on you Aer Lingus and if you continue this, with what I can only assume is a "cost cutting exercise" then you have lost a customer. If you do decide to travel with Aer Lingus make sure you bring a packet of wet wipes and a bin bag, as it seems to be a do it yourself clean.

### "praise the cabin crew "
I recently flew from Boston to Dublin alone with my 6 month old daughter. I have to highly praise the cabin crew on both flights, they were terrific and really helped me out with my very active non sleeping 6 month old. I am Irish and travel home a lot to see family and friends and after the wonderful experience I will not be nervous to travel alone with my daughter again. I've already booked my flights home for Christmas and wouldn't dream of travelling with anybody but Aer Lingus. Thank you so much.

### "great food and staff"
I have flown with Aer Lingus to the USA to visit my girlfriend in December 2014 and in June 2015 to return to Ireland in September 2015. Being Irish I wanted to go on a flight with my national carrier. An A330-200 in December from Dublin to Boston. Return to Dublin 10 days after aircraft A330-300  also very comfortable. Although I flew on A330-200 in December which was fine the return trip lots of people were having issues with the in flight entertainment system mine was ok but lots of people's had to be re-booted which I thought was quite poor for Aer Lingus. The food has been good giving that it is provided free on these flights. Great airline food and staff, good planes 2-4-2 config seating, the only issue I have is the entertainment system the touch screen is horrible on all these planes and lack of content to watch they need to upgrade a lot. The in flight WiFi was great but it should be included in your ticket since you do pay quite a sum for a flight to the USA - or reduce the price.

### "good onboard service"
Dublin to Munich return with Aer Lingus. Full flights, good onboard service, friendly crew and informative pilots. Staff were efficient and chatty. Flights on time. Highly recommended.

### "commend a flight attendant"
We flew with Aer Lingus from Dublin to Orlando on 22nd October. We requested a seat near the toilets for our daughter who is wheelchair bound and cannot stand, and we ended up 4 rows away which is a big distance to carry her along the isle. This happened because the plane was changed at the last minute. I would hope we are near the toilets on the way home. I would like to commend a flight attendant who took over the situation and tried to get us moved closer but to no avail. She assured us there was a wheelchair onboard to take our daughter to the toilet and that she would gladly assist us. This set our minds at ease and I would like to thank her very much for her help in the situation. My overall rating is because we did not get the proper seats on check in.

### "staff extremely helpful"
Very short Aer Lingus flight from Manchester to Dublin. Completely full and delayed by about 30 mins. Turned it around quickly at Manchester Airport. Easy and helpful check in. Cabin staff extremely helpful especially the purser with good announcements. Prices can be high best to book early to get the best deal.

### "unable to modify trip online"
I made Aer Lingus reservations online. I was unable to get a boarding pass online. I was unable to modify the trip online. I had to fly back early because of a medical issue. I could not get the information for insurance online or over the phone. Flight was acceptable, but seats are narrow, the touch screen on the toy on the seat backs are faulty, you have to hope the person behind you doesn't bang on the touch screen.

### "very confused and sad"
I had a trip to Barcelona and returned back to Toronto yesterday (Oct 18, 2015) by Aer Lingus. Instead of sharing to my friends of my great time in Barcelona, I have to share my terrible experience with Aer Lingus. I took EI0563 from Barcelona to Dublin and then EI0129 from Dublin to Toronto, the layover is 80 minutes. However, EI0563 arrived at Dublin about 30 minutes late so there was no much time left for the long line up security check and get to the gate for EI0129. When I finally got on the plane EI0129, the overhead storage bins were full. A flight attendant told me he would help me to find a space for my baggage and took it away. After a while he came back with a Baggage Identification Tag telling me that when I exit the plane I would get my baggage with the tag. When the plane arrived at Toronto airport, I showed tag to a flight attendant and requested by baggage back. However I was told to get my baggage at pick-up area. I was confused as it was a carry-on, not a checked-in baggage. I went to baggage pick-up area and got my baggage. It had strong smell of wine. I was shocked after I opened it : it was full of broken glasses of bottle wine which I bought at duty free store in Barcelona airport, broken porcelain souvenirs which were very valuable and bought from several cities in Spain, and clothes soaking in red wine. I was very confused and sad for what had happened. The flight attendant should have known the carry-on baggage was not suitable for checked-in baggage for a variety of reasons. They never checked with me what was inside and if it was appropriate to send it to checked-in baggage area.

### "disappointed in my plane ride"
I thought the service and the quality of Aer Lingus left a lot to be desired. The crew were snippy and not real helpful on our trip to Dublin - on our return we had a more seasoned crew and they were more helpful with things I didn't know how to do. TV would start then stop and not restart, tried numerous movies never finished a one as couldn't get it to move. Arm rest would not go all the way up so it stuck in my side for 6 hrs. I don't pretend to be five ft five and 130 lbs but I do believe you could at least fix the arm rests so those of us that are bigger would not have to have them sticking into our sides the whole way. It made me apprehensive for my return trip, which I have to say was a little better then going. I'm very disappointed in my plane ride and would be very apprehensive to fly Aer Lingus again.

### "comfortable A330 layout"
Chicago to Geneva via Dublin with Aer Lingus. The good: clean modern plane with comfortable A330 layout, two aisles and 2-4-2 seating. Great seat comfort with top-line Recaro seats in economy. Tight seats but very good back, bottom and lumbar support and I think a foot rest. Overweight passengers have a difficult time fitting into these seats. Seatback TV worked well in one direction and poorly the other. Food was poor from Chicago to Dublin but good from Dublin to Chicago. Very good prices when booked months in advance. Dublin airport is an outstanding connection point. Took only 10 minutes from leaving first plane to going through passport control and reaching second plane's gate. On return trip from Europe to USA, truly amazing and complete USA passport and customs pre-clearance at Dublin airport. When deboarding at Chicago O'Hare, went straight to special luggage carousel and out to the street in only minutes! Highly recommend Aer Lingus and Dublin airport for flight connections from USA to and from many cities in Europe. The bad: they charge for everything including transatlantic wine, coffee and water.

### "no hesitation flying again"
Short hop to Dublin from Newcastle with Aer Lingus. First time I've flown with Aer Lingus, on an ATR72 and was happy with both. Comfortable cabin, given it was a lot smaller to what I've have experienced before. Flight on time and quick return of bags in Dublin. Would have no hesitation flying again.

### "baggage policy is not enforced"
Having taken time to purchase cabin baggage of the appropriate size for Aer Lingus regional flights we were very disappointed to note that other people had ignored this requirement and that the policy is not enforced. As the flight was fully booked some luggage was stowed in the hold at no cost. This added time and hassle to our travel experience. Why bother having a policy if it is, in effect, meaninglessness? Staff were friendly and we had no other issues that were negative.

### "the staff were friendly"
A very good Aer Lingus flight from Dublin to London. The seats were comfortable and the staff were friendly. The flight overall was very smooth and had no problems at all. Out of the three airlines we had flown with for our holidays in Ireland and Canada, Aer Lingus was the best. Would fly with them again.

### "I was stunned. paying for water"
The Aer Lingus staff was extremely professional and courteous on our arrival and return flights. Our route was from Chicago to Dublin to Rome. The seat room was surprisingly adequate. The flight was comfortable, and the pilot did an amazing job landing on arrival to Rome, and on the return flight. The food on the way to Dublin from Chicago was ok. Normally on international flights, wine is complementary with meals, but not with Aer Lingus. That is fine. But if I am paying $6.00 for a little bottle of wine, it should be a good wine and not in a plastic bottle. I never waste wine, but in this case I could only drink half. We were served dinner, and a snack prior to arrival in Dublin. There wasn't coffee service, one had to get up to get it. There was coffee service on the return flight. From Dublin to Rome return we had to pay for any beverage or snack. I was stunned. Paying for water or soft drink is unacceptable. The dinner on the return flight was chicken and rice, with 1 chicken strip. I feel bad writing this because the staff was so friendly, and go out of their way to make everyone comfortable. But unless one is going to Dublin only on transatlantic flights, I can't recommend this airline, sorry.

### "service onboard was excellent"
Paris CDG to Dublin on a Sunday evening, paid for a flex fare as it was a short notice flight and there wasn't much of a difference between all the fares listed. Access the ICARE lounge in CDG, small but with free drinks and refreshments and wifi; bit of a depressing room though. The flex ticket grants you priority boarding which was fantastic as I was sitting at the front of the plane (row three) so was able to find space in the overhead locker for my bag. Boarding was a bit chaotic. The service onboard was excellent, crew were in great spirits chatting away and serving efficiently. The onboard menu or rather the quality of the products is ahead of Ryanair. I would say though that they should possibly think of branching out in their selection of pre-order meals and that maybe pax paying the flex fare should be entitled to free drinks and snacks onboard. All-in-all, a great flight.

### "brilliant experience, thanks to friendly crew"
Manchester to New York via Dublin with Aer Lingus. Left the miserable staff of Manchester airport for the smiley staff of Dublin airport. Strolled through security and immigration without problem. Boarded our flight, greeted by lovely staff who couldn't do enough for us, and this went on for the whole flight. They dealt with a gentleman who took ill as we were taxiing and had to leave the flight with such care and professionalism. The wine choice was very good as was the food for inflight dining. The cabin was clean and fresh with plenty of room and wifi! On arrival at JFK our luggage was there within minutes, and we left the airport without that awful standing in line to clear immigration you normally have. Return flight overnight on Sept 22nd another brilliant experience, thanks to the friendly crew who carried out duties with a focused attitude. We were extremely impressed with the overall experience. Well done Aer Lingus and Dublin airport. As soon as we trade in our BA air miles we will become Aer Lingus customers.

### "preposterously tight seats"
We boarded on time, about half an hour before departure, and then sat and  - in preposterously tight seats. With a Kindle in the seat back pocket my knees were hard up against the seat in front and I do not have long legs. We were told by a flight attendant that there was a "technical problem". After an hour or so they came round with drinks. After two hours they were looking like they might bring more drinks but we overheard two flight attendants talking and they said it couldn't be fixed. A few minutes past two hours late they decided the aircraft was fixed. All they said was that there was a bad sensor. Something near three hours after we boarded the aircraft we finally pushed back and started up. One drink in three hours doesn't seem like they met their obligation in the USA to feed and water us when delays exceed two hours. After departure they finally fed us. I had requested a dairy free meal. What a disaster. Basically it was vegan, but vegan with zero imagination. Mostly dry pasta with some tasteless veg on top. The sweet was an oily cake. Awful food. I had to walk around several times to deal with the pain in my knees from tight seats. Other than that the flight was uneventful, just uncomfortable and unpalatable. The entertainment was nothing to brag about.

### "the worst airline I have been on"
Chicago to Dublin return with Aer Lingus, and this is the worst airline I have been on. The food was terrible but worse were the seats. The aisles are so small that you must carry your purse in front of you. It won't fit on the side. Space between the rows is so small that when the person in front leans back, you cannot move at all. My husband is tall and was so miserable, but I am very small and I had to crawl out of my seat. We paid a great deal for these economy seats and literally could not walk after we arrived in Dublin. Leaving Dublin was even worse. There is one line for all passengers, no matter which AerLingus flight they are on. We were in line for 1.5 hours before we had to go to the line for security - which is done twice. It took 3 hours to get to our flight. By the way, there is a sign that suggests you bring your bags the night before to the airport. If you are only visiting for a week you can enjoy your vacation at the airport.

### "cabin service was professional and attentive"
First trip in the new Aer Lingus Business Class, flying Dublin to Chicago. Airport check in was quick and easy and the business class/gold circle lounge offered a good choice of drinks with some snacks and had good wi-fi connectivity. About 90 minutes before departure we were invited to clear US immigration and customs in Dublin and boarding commenced about 45 minutes before departure. Once onboard the cabin was a big improvement over the previous version. I was seated in 3K which was very private and spacious. The seat was easy to adjust and offers a comfortable lie flat sleeping position (I'm 6ft1). There are plenty of stowages for small items adjacent to the seat as well as the overhead bins. The seat also offered a power outlet compatible with UK/US devices. IFE was good and offered a reasonable choice of on demand entertainment but was a bit short of new release movies. Business class passengers are offered complimentary wi-fi which worked well for the majority of the flight. The cabin service was professional and attentive and the inflight meal was good quality. Pre departure drinks were offered and after departure there was a canapés service followed by the main meal service. The crew were on hand for anything else throughout the flight and there was an afternoon tea service about an hour before landing. I had ordered a gluten free meal which was rather unimaginative but the standard meal options looked good. Arrival into Chicago was on time and having cleared immigration and customs in Dublin you can get from the aircraft to baggage claim and out the door in minutes.

### "say thank you to Aer Lingus"
I'm writing to say thank you to Aer Lingus for looking after me on a recent trip. On 21st July, I had a 6:20pm flight booked with Aer Lingus from Dublin to Birmingham. Unfortunately, I arrived at the airport late and, to make matters worse, I misplaced my carry-on luggage in the duty-free shop, which meant I couldn't make my flight. Not only did the helpful ground staff reassure me and find my case for me, a manager provided a seat on the next flight free of charge. This is the kind of service that goes above : a sympathetic and generous solution to what could have been a very stressful situation. My sincere thanks to everyone at Aer Lingus.

### "crew on board so helpful and sweet"
On my Aer Lingus flight to Chicago I became ill, suffering from motion sickness. The crew on board are so helpful and sweet to me. During the flight, they were constantly checking on me and moved me up to the business class so I can recover. I wanted to thank the Aer Lingus staff from that day!

### "will never book Aer Lingus again"
Aer Lingus flight Dublin to London was comfortabe enough, plenty of legroom but the service on plane left a lot to be desired on both outbound and return flights between Dublin and London. When providing snack service the gentleman beside me was asked if he required anything, whilst I was not given the same courtesy, with them walking off without any acknowledgement. Same situation with duty free. Asked while quickly walking down the aisle if anyone wished to make a purchase, and continued walking without looking at passengers to see if they required anything. Thought I would get duty free on return flight instead, only to push my attendant button, as requested over the speaker to do so if wanting duty free. However, this was ignored and when I managed to get hold of someone to directly tell them I was waiting to order I was advised we were landing and could not do so. Worst service received and will never book through Aer Lingus again.

### "staff on flight were friendly"
In transit from JFK I was a little nervous about having Duty Free, as there was no transfer route open and we had to go out and check in again. The sealed duty free bag worked perfectly and me and my hand luggage were soon inside the Business Class lounge at Shannon, which is lovely - if lacking in food stuff - with delightful staff. Staff on the flight were friendly and Irish breakfast was soon on my tray table. The orange juice had a strange fizzy taste on drinking and sadly would appear that it was off. The new coffee offering also doesn't seem that popular - sharp and bitter tasting and I noticed quite a few customers sending it back untouched. Arrived into Terminal 2 in time and checked bag collection took 10 minutes. A nice flight, despite the breakfast disaster.

### "A very pleasant experience"
We checked in early at JFK for EI110 to Shannon, and the process was quick and painless. Terminal 5 is well organised and went through Fast Track security. The new Gold Circle Lounge is around Gate 26 which is a bit of a trek away from the departure gates. Aer Lingus offer a dine before you board facility in the lounge, but it's not that bi, and the selection is not that great - the sandwich options were a better option. Boarding on time and we soon relaxed in seats 2F and 2D with a glass of champagne before take off. Two very nice crew looked after us on the flight which seemed busy - Business Class was full. The seats were different on this flight (an Aer Lingus branded plane it was a Boeing 757 operated by Air Contractors). There was no difference in crew service and quality of catering. After take off drinks and canapés offered which were great. The senior crew member in Business was polite and friendly and interacted well. Dinner with a choice of Herb Crusted Loin of Lamb, Roast Chicken Breast with Ricotta Cannelloni, and Roasted Cod with cabbage and fennel. This was followed by a cheese plate. My partner had the vegetarian meal which was stuffed ravioli and thoroughly enjoyed. PTV screen wasn't as big as the outward journey but selection of films and TV was around the same. The seat more or less was flat, and was comfortable enough to grab a cat nap. Breakfast was served around an hour from Shannon - fruit plate, Hot Irish Bacon Roll which was delicious, and coffee. A very pleasant experience that I would happily repeat.

### Aer Lingus customer review
I fly Birmingham to Dublin regularly, used to fly Manchester to Dublin many times a year. Seems that they reduce the frequency on these busy routes in the Summer to deploy aircraft on seasonal routes. Schedules in Winter are much better and have just booked five flights for the next few months from Birmingham. Interestingly every one of them was cheaper than flights on same dates at similar times with Ryanair. I always fly Aer Lingus over Ryanair unless there is a huge difference in price. The aircraft are usually clean and trolleys well stocked. I say this because it seems on Ryanair they stock the trolleys in the morning and sell out on later flights. A benefit of flying Aer Lingus is you arrive and depart T2 Dublin. Aer Lingus has been marketing itself as a low cost airline, and they charge for food and drinks. Overall always happy with Aer Lingus.

### Aer Lingus customer review
Hadn't flown Aer Lingus for a while so was interested to see what the London to Dublin hop was like these days. As had an onward connection was given a Gold Circle Lounge pass - the lounge is well appointed in Terminal 2 and nicely decorated although found the food offerings slightly lacking. The flight was delayed by 30 minutes but we were kept updated and boarding was prompt and efficient. We were seated in 12E and F and sound the amount of legroom ok. The captain was keen to try and make up time so the service inflight was pretty rushed with the Bia trolleys not reaching all the passengers. Crew coped well though and were polite and friendly throughout. A nice flight that arrived in Dublin only 15 minutes late compared to the 30-40 minutes late departure from LHR.

### Aer Lingus customer review
I hadn't travelled Aer Lingus Business Class for about 15 years and was looking forward to a trip down memory lane as I used to do the Dublin to JFK route regularly. The trip had been planned for ages, and I had checked and double checked the arrangements with the Airline about 4-5 times as I had booked through an agent and all seemed in order. Arrived Saturday morning and had a painless check in and bag drop and soon found ourselves in the T2 Business Class lounge which is nice and well appointed. The food offering is nowhere near as good as other lounges with limited cold stuff available. We were called to go through Immigration at 09.30 and the idea of doing this in Dublin rather face the queues at JFK is still pure genius. This was quick and efficient and couldn't be faulted and we were in the boarding area within 15 minutes before being called to Board the EI105 at 10.00. We were greeted by the Cabin Service Manager who showed us to our seats in 2H and 2K. Jackets were taken and we were offered a drink by the lovely Senior Cabin crew member who looked after us throughout the flight. Take off was on time. Shortly after take off we were offered drinks and a smal dish of canapés. I was a bit surprised that my Vegetarian partner was offered the fish ones, and at this stage we discovered that the many times confirmed Lacto Vegetarian meal had not been loaded. The crew said not to worry and they would sort something out. The lunch menu offered a choice of starters of Chicken Liver Pate or Burren Smokehouse hot and cold smoked salmon which is pictured. My partner was offered the cheese plate from the dessert offering. I had the Salmon which was great. Mains were a choice of Collar of Irish Bacon, Lambay Island Irish Lamb Stew or a Luxury Crisp fish pie - the crew recommended the bacon which is pictured and was delicious. At this point my partner was advised that the Vegetarian meal had been found (looked like in economy) and it was just the tray that was missing. He was served a Vegetarian pasta dish which he said was fine Dessert was a choice of Lemon Tart or Cheese Plate both of which wee good and there was a rather nice Sancerrre on offer with lunch which was also good This was the new style business class but it would appear that Aer Lingus has ditched the idea of dining on demand as this was not offered. The new seat is brilliant though a massive lie flat bed, that is really comfy, together with a big screen to enjoy a decent selection of television in demand, and free wifi for business class customers. There is also a selection of snacks in the galley now - crisps sandwiches fruit - that kind of thing. About an hour before landing we were served a rather odd Super Power Salad of quinoa, courgette and feta cheese which wasn't the tastiest thing I had ever had on a plane, but the scones that accompanied it were great. We landed in JFK at 13.15 and we were out of Terminal 5 and in Terminal 4 with bags at 13.35 which was absolutely superb. All in all, despite the meal mix up, this was an excellent Transatlantic crossing that left many other bigger airlines in the shade, and given the favourable price, one that I would happily recommend.

### Aer Lingus customer review
Full flight, left and arrived on time. Did not purchase any refreshments on this short journey.

### Aer Lingus customer review
Aer Lingus has lived in my memory fondly for years, primarily due to their past excellent service on both transatlantic and regional routes. No more. This short flight was enough to convince me that the Irish government was foolish in not allowing Ryanair to buy out the "flag carrier" and put it to its well-deserved death. Dublin Airport is one of the worst there is - long foot travel, very few conveniences, unhelpful staff, generally a frenzied dump of an airport, and this swaps over onto Aer Lingus, too. The former proud little airline hit hard times and sought to revive its fortunes as "ultra low cost carrier", thus taking on Ryanair head to head - what a stupid idea. Legroom is so tight. There is no inflight entertainment of any kind, the cabin was not fresh, and absolutely everything - from water on down, must be purchased from sometimes surly staff. British Airways has just bought Aer Lingus, possibly to establish its own low-cost brand, but I am hoping against the odds that they will actually invest and restore Aer Lingus to what it once was and used to be - a decent airline with happy employees and excellent service to and from Ireland.

### Aer Lingus customer review
Chose Aer Lingus primarily due to low fare compared to more established airlines which fly Germany to the USA. You have to pay for your beer or wine. Otherwise, the on-board service was top and the food quality very good. Economy seats had more legroom than many other airlines. However, the main advantage is going through US Immigration in Dublin and landing domestic at terminal 5 at JFK New York. In my previous experience, immigration in NY or SFO often means standing in line for up to 2 hours.

### Aer Lingus customer review
Flew with Aer Lingus Regional operated by Stobart Air from Dublin to Manchester. At Dublin Airport boarding was efficient and relaxed even though we were bussed to a remote stand. The 70 seater ATR 72-600 is in a 2-2 seating configuration so I found the smaller aircraft more relaxing than an A320 or B738. The aircraft was modern (2 years old) and clean. Seat comfort and legroom were reasonable enough. Drinks and snacks were sold on this flight even though it was very short. The two cabin crew members were very friendly. The flight arrived on time in Manchester and we were bussed to Terminal 1. If you are flying Aer Lingus Regional from Dublin I advise going through security at Terminal 1 as the walk to the gates is shorter.

### Aer Lingus customer review
After flying Ryanair for the past 7 years, I found a cheap fare for Aer Lingus, I didn't hesitate to book the flag-carrier for my return leg. Boarding was a shambles to be blunt about it, like cows walking into a barn, just banging into each other and no order of a queue. This was due to handling agents at Venice and not EI crew. The departure was speedy and comfortable, the crew were very smily and friendly upon boarding. The captain have numerous updates throughout the flight about delays and our ETA. Meal service was excellent. Although slow, this didn't matter on the 3 hour flight. The food was so fresh. I could tell the scone was baked recently and the bread on my sandwich was so soft. The best inflight food I've head in a while to be honest. Although it's not free, it is reasonably priced. The approach was very quick and we landed 10 minutes ahead of schedule after departing 20 minutes late which was nice. De boarding was nice and a big farewell from the smiley crew. A very enjoyable flight.

### Aer Lingus customer review
The third Aer Lingus European flight I've taken in the space of 3 weeks, with excellent and experienced crew. Baggage delivery in Dublin super fast. Only let-down seems to be their agents and  handlers at their European bases. This time, passengers were left queueing at the wrong checkin area, some for over an hour, before discretely telling only some passengers it was changed to another area and everyone started running leaving many disgruntled customers and tense exchanges in queues over who was ahead of who. Lastly, check-in only commenced 1 hour 50 minutes before scheduled departure and not the 2 hour 30 minutes indicated on their website. Aer Lingus reputation being seriously compromised by uninterested and unprofessional ground agents in some Airports.

### Aer Lingus customer review
Twice in the past two months, the online check-in service was not working several hours prior to check-in - neither on the phone or on the PC. (I travel often with AL along with Ryanair and Air France and I know what I am doing). Aer Lingus has been making a big thing in its advertising how you can be "smart" by using their different ways to check-in. Well I had to check in at the airport and arrive much earlier, like other passengers. That was quite disruptive. Worse still, the Aer Lingus customer service (in two separate messages) does not reply in response to this matter. A pity, as otherwise a good product. I've never had this disruption with Air France or Ryanair.

### Aer Lingus customer review
12.00pm flight, Sunday 2nd August, however we weren't airborne until 12.40pm due to aircraft arriving late from Dusseldorf. Big queues at Check-in/bag drop in T2 but managed well by Staff. Only major complaint here is the extortionate €50 to Check-in a bag at airport (one-way) as I'd forgotten to online. Flight itself was staffed by an excellent crew who willingly engaged with passengers throughout. Service was relatively quick for such a packed flight and prices very reasonable. Bags in Lyon took 1/2 an hour to start delivery, for whatever reason as the airport seemed quiet, which inconvenienced my getting the onward train connection. All in all another decent job by AL.

### Aer Lingus customer review
Having flown several times from NY to European countries I immediately noticed a significant difference in quality. The aircraft seemed old and somewhat threadbare, the cabin (not individual) A/C was much too cold for 7 hours, food was of poor quality and the sound from the entertainment system was inaudible.

### Aer Lingus customer review
EI134 (06 July 15) and EI135 (27 July 15) were Omni Air International 767's with non-Irish crew. In-flight entertainment was startlingly bad in first class on EI134 (chunky hand-held viewers with three or four tepid films) and non-existent on EI135 (even fewer films and shows repeated on tiny seat-back screens hourly, as in the 1990's). There was no in-flight wi-fi, so good thing I brought a book. First class inflight meal (EI134) was good, but first selection (beef) was unavailable. Inflight meal on EI135 was positively inedible except for the roll - not even dressing for the salad. First choice of meals on EI135 (chicken) was unavailable again. Second choice was tentatively identified as "beef". This was a shabby performance by Aer Lingus and I have come to expect much better.

### Aer Lingus customer review
Travelled with my 2 sons ages 4 and 7. Had ordered 2 children's meals and found out at service their meals weren't on board. Due to being delayed my son's went 8 hours without a meal and I had to feed them chocolate throughout the flight. Also the inflight entertainment did not show one children's movie. Awful customer service, they won't let me talk to a manager or Senior member of staff and have forced a travel voucher upon me I did not wish to accept.

### Aer Lingus customer review
Arrived somewhat early for the flight and had to wait an hour for check-in to open as the queue continued to grow. However, check-in staff were friendly and quickly got through the line. A full flight so boarding was a tad chaotic moreso due to passengers not obeying the gate announcements. The flight closed up 25 mins after scheduled takeoff time (8.35pm) and consequently the pilot informed us we missed our slot and could not be airborne until 9.50pm Luckily, the situation improved and we took off at 9.30pm arriving in Dublin only 15 mins behind schedule. The senior cabin manager was delightful, accommodating and always smiling. Nice flight, efficient inflight service, cockpit updates and baggage delivered very quickly upon arrival. All in all a very good experience despite the initial delays.

### Aer Lingus customer review
Was delayed in Dublin, flight cancelled to Jersey in the end, but put in marvellous hotel, provided 3 course meal and prompt transport back to airport in the morning. Greatful thanks to Aer Lingus and taxi service they provided.

### Aer Lingus customer review
I had a connection in Dublin for 2 hours, which stresses me out the most. During the JFK-DUB leg, the crew was the most hospitable crew I have met. My seat was broken, making me recline without pressing the button, and the IFE had a pretty poor choice of movies, but other than that, Aer Lingus left me with an impression. Dublin Airport is clean, and when I was there for the connection, we were the only outbound flight, so the terminal was empty. Would fly with Aer Lingus again, especially with their incredible prices.

### Aer Lingus customer review
I was positively surprised when I recently in July 2015 flew with a friend from London Heathrow to Belfast City Airport and back again. I booked tickets several weeks in advance and got a good value flight. The website was clear with what one needed to pay extra. With the flight only an hour, I didn't want to pay extra for premium economy seats that would've guaranteed a more comfortable flight for a tall person like me (2m). Yet, I hoped that if the flight wasn't fully booked the staff would be flexible and allow me to sit in an exit row. Years of flying have continued to confirm to me that if you want service and flexibility, go with the "legacy" airlines, as opposed to the "low-cost" ones where you have to pay for everything. Once again, I politely asked and the Aer Lingus staff happily obliged - on both trips. As such, I was very pleased for the quality I got on this short-haul flight within the UK. I've not flown Aer Lingus long-haul, so I can't comment, but based on this experience I would be ready to try Aer Lingus transatlantically if they offered a good price and connection.

### Aer Lingus customer review
Flown this week and if any doubts left, clearly a low cost airline. Nothing for free not even water. Both planes in a poor condition with different seats. Even the announcements which are programmed were different which indicates to non homogated fleet. Flight attendants with poor attitude towards passengers.

### Aer Lingus customer review
Arrived in plenty of time for the flight only to be told it had been over-sold. I was told I must go on standby, with no option otherwise. I was assured that my baggage would be on the next flight out (4 hours later) which I caught. On arrival in Dublin sure enough, no baggage. This is hugely inconvenient as I am away on business with no change of clothes etc. The staff at the desk were overstretched, and not very helpful. I travel a lot with Aer Lingus and I have to say that their service is getting worse each time I fly.

### Aer Lingus customer review
The flight attendants were very rude, and the media system was broken which didn't help an 8 hour flight. Kept asking for updates about it and the flight attendants didn't acknowledge it. They only came around with drinks once. Food was inedible, and the leg room was small even for an airplane. I've flown internationally many times before and Aer Lingus was the worst in my opinion.

### Aer Lingus customer review
Very good experience. Check-in and boarding were quick and efficient. The airplane is very clean and the cabin crew were friendly and helpful. There is a good variety of food sold on the airplane.

### Aer Lingus customer review
Flew from Belfast to Gatwick, the plane was oldish and not very comfortable, I felt really squashed where I was sitting. Plane took off on time and arrived a few minutes early on the other side, so no complaints there. Boarding was relatively quick and the cabin crew were personable, one passenger complained of being ill during the flight and was attended to with care and attention. A hassle free trip but they do need more space between seats on their planes, this is a national airline, not a budget one.

### Aer Lingus customer review
I had a very pleasant experience flying with Aer Lingus. Although the business class is not up to par with most other airlines, it is far from bad and the service was great - Irish hospitality at its best!

### Aer Lingus customer review
SFO-DUB, LHR-DUB-SFO. Ground staff excellent. On time departure. Flight staff were just going through the motions and seemed as though they couldn't care less about the passengers. Seating was tight, but bearable. Inflight entertainment was pretty good. Meals were not so good and beverage service was below standard. Had issues with passenger behind us that allowed their child to continuously kick the back of our seat. We asked the mother once of the problem yet the child continued. Asked again to please have your child stop the kicking. Third time was enough and flight crew intervened and helped settle the problem. A cookie for the kicking child and a glass of wine for us. Very odd situation but handled OK by crew. Overall the flight seemed short handed, stressed and just did not want to do their job. Return flight back was like night and day. Our baggage was well above the limit but nothing was said and they checked us in with no questions. Both flights were on time. Ground staff friendly and helpful, cabin crew were friendly, helpful and outgoing. Meals were actually tasty and there were non-stop beverage runs. The crew came across happy and willing to please the passengers. I got on the plane dreading the flight but departed with a positive attitude. Seating is tight though. I recommend Aer Lingus as an alternative airlines if you are looking for a budget alternative to flying.

### Aer Lingus customer review
Excellent friendly service. Able to fly in and out of Cardiff when other flights were cancelled due to fog. Maybe more expensive than alternatives, but reliable. Preferred airline on the Cardiff-Dublin route.

### Aer Lingus customer review
JFK-SNN-LHR, FCO-DUB-JFK. The first leg of this trip, JFK-SNN, was operated by Air Contractors (I actually think this was the best flight out of the 4). The Boeing 757 cabin was clean. There were pillows and blankets on each seat. The IFE was sufficient for a ~5 hour flight. There was a meal 1-1.5 hours after takeoff (Chicken or Beef). It was okay and what one would expect of an airline meal. SNN-LHR and FCO-DUB were on A320s. The planes were clean but the seats were a little bit tight. There were no IFE on both flights and they charged for food and beverage. DUB-JFK on an A330 dual aisle plane. No pillow and blanket at my seat but they had blankets available for the passengers. The IFE was again sufficient for 7 hour flight. There was a meal after takeoff and a light snack before landing. The boarding process on all 4 flights were effective and all 4 flights left on time. The flight attendants were friendly and attentive. The check in staff at FCO T1 was not but can't really fault them on that.

Boston - Dublin May 15 flight 138 - was supposed to be an Aer Lingus aircraft but apparently several days out they had to charter a plane from Omni International - which is generally used as troop transport - that was filthy crammed to the gills with the maximum seats. There went our prepaid extra legroom seats no air controls no Aer Lingus staff no individual seat TVs nothing - it was horrible and the worst part - no prior notice. Then - coming back Aer Lingus Shannon - Boston May 31 flight 135 - supposed to be a double aisle aircraft - you guessed it - Boeing 757 - one aisle - 6 hours and no explanations. Yes I understand the airlines can substitute aircraft - but (especially on flight 138) a comparable and comfortable substitute should have been made. I was appalled (and I am a regular traveler to Ireland).

Boston – Dublin. Flight EI136. Dublin – Naples. Flight EI450. I last traveled on Aer Lingus in 1977 as a child. The service was excellent and the food was great. So when I booked our trip in May 2015 to Italy through Dublin to Naples I was excited. I could not have been more disappointed. The service was terrible. There was only 1 flight attendant that gave a faint smile (and that was on all legs of the trip. A British staff member was on board for the final Dublin to Boston flight via Titan Airlines. They were a breath of fresh air and were very pleasant and actually smiled). The food was bad. The plane was pretty clean though. This was the cheapest airline I have flown on. They kept charging for everything. On the flight from Dublin to Naples they charged for every single thing even water. Not one thing was distributed for free. I could see if I paid very little for my flight but this was not a cheap rock bottom fare. Frankly I was ashamed of being Irish after I took the first leg of the trip. We were traveling with 10 other people and all agreed that they would have no interest in traveling to Ireland for a future vacation. So Aer Lingus - you might be saving a lot of money but you are obliterating anyone's desires to travel to Ireland in the future.

10/5 Sunday flight Dublin to LHR. Went to book luggage in and was grabbed and asked if I wanted to be put on the earlier flight which was good. I had previously paid for a seat upfront but only got row 9 in the reorg which was odd as there were spare seats on the earlier flight. Bad news - loads of planes leaving at that time so really only gained about half an hour but hey not their fault. Usual problem though - people with too much luggage and no idea of how to stow on board. They did weigh some and grab some but I feel they need to monitor this when people get on the plane as some people really are quite selfish and clueless. Also Aer Lingus passengers take forever getting on or off a plane which actually does matter if you have trains and buses to get. However cheaper than Ryanair and quite pleasant.

We flew Dublin to Paris on May 13th 2015. From the start we were greeted with disinterested and unfriendly staff at check in. Even though I checked in with my husband we were not seated next to each other even though the plane wasn't full. I moved myself over to sit with him before take off but why would they seat us apart? The cabin crew were miserable. Finally they rush through with the tea and coffee and snacks that you have to purchase and staff didn't even bother to ask us if we would like something. The plane itself was disgustingly dirty with drink stains spilled on the seat. The back of the seats holding the magazines was vile with what looked like a mixture of spilt drink food and mould. We will never fly Aer Lingus again.

### Aer Lingus customer review
I traveled from Munich to Boston in early January 2015. The experience at Munich airport was very poor particularly the passport control line which was 45 minutes of unrestrained and uncontrolled pushing and shoving. Probably not Aer Lingus' fault but still a poor start. I had paid for a business class ticket over the internet. Did not find out until getting on the plane that the first part of the trip (Munich to Dublin) was economy as there are no business class seats on the plane. Typical economy experience. The actual business class portion of the trip (Dublin to Boston) was excellent. However the fare (which looked reasonable initially) in retrospect seemed far too high given that 3 hours of the 9 hour trip were actually not business class. I had a medical issue that caused me to book the business class ticket so I was really horrified at the unexpected 3 hours in economy which I had bought the business class ticket specifically to avoid.

On a return journey to Dublin from Lanzarote (flight 779) I had fallen unwell 15 minutes post takeoff. The urge to throw-up a feeling not welcomed by most especially not at 30000+ altitude was overwhelming and a sense of unwanted panic set in. Luckily I was accompanied by my boyfriend whom along with the diligent and empathetic flight crew got me back on track for the remainder of the flight. Frequently asking if I was ok or whether I needed anything was a small but oh so grand gesture which made such a positive difference.

April 15th flight 108 return 26th Apr flight 105. My mother and I flew from JFK to Dublin and return. We were in economy from JFK to DUB and in Premier class on the return trip. Both were great experiences and on Aer Lingus new A330. The food was excellent in both cabins. We opted for the succulent steal ($18) in Economy and it was delicious. Crew were lovely. On return we were in the new Premier class cabin. The crew the food the service was terrific. You really could not ask for more.

Sunday flight 18.00 from Dublin to Heathrow. Late boarding apparently due to inbound plane being late which is odd as it arrived on time. Then the most ridiculous shambles of boarding that took forever. If people have paid for seats then they should get on first especially as some people are greedy with hand luggage and seem incapable of stowing it correctly. Finally after a good wait I got to get on the plane to find the lady on my row had blocked an entire area by putting her case in the wrong way round! Why is this not monitored? Its about time this boarding procedure was improved upon. Its the same old story. If its a full plane supervise them and get people to board both front and back!

When I arrived to Brussels airport I had pre-booked my seat a week beforehand. There was a problem with the system and my seat was given away to someone else. I asked then for a window seat and this was not given. I was seated in the centre of the plane in an aisle seat so I had no view of the scenery as we were departing and landing. The cabin crew were friendly. I had pre-booked a hot meal leek and cheddar quiche which was forgotten.

### Aer Lingus customer review
Flew from Rome to Dublin with Aer Lingus on Friday 10th April. Very slow check-in with a huge queue. More importantly I can't understand why Aer Lingus make you check-in in Terminal Three and then make you walk the whole way back to Terminal one to board plane to Dublin - this is a long trudge from Terminal three through terminal two to terminal one. You would need a up to an hour to do this walk. (including long security check line). When you fly into Rome you go into terminal one and can exit there. When we finally got to gate the staff insisted on taking carry-on bags from some people (but not all) because the flight was full. In the end the overhead lockers were half empty but some people had a long wait for their luggage. Aer Lingus need to improve their ground facilities in Rome and move the check in desk to terminal one adjacent to the gate.

From London to Dublin. The short haul flight was on time. Take-off and landing were very smooth. Cabin crew were friendly and helpful. Ground staff at Heathrow should improve their skills. She asked me to check-in my big suitcase at the boarding gate because she could not print the luggage tag for me - it was too late. I went back to the check-in counter at the time she announced. Finally I was stopped by security due to the liquid in my big suitcase. I missed the flight and I was o/b the next flight.

Travelled MCO-DUB with an infant. Check in all ok at the airport but once on the plane the partner of the man seated next to me in row 2 made a huge fuss about my son (who was sitting quietly and minding his own business) being in the cabin to which the female crew member replied 'I agree but there's nothing I can do about it'. The other male crew member was 'too busy' to bring an infant lap belt once the doors had closed and I was offered neither a drink or a meal. Really poor service added to an outdated seat I wouldn't recommend Aer Lingus.

### Aer Lingus customer review
Boston to Dublin on March 18 flight EI 0138 and Dublin to New York on March 30 flight EI 0105. What a bunch of cold flight attendants. I have never experienced anything like it. A smile must cost them a million or cause them a lot of pain. Maybe it's these ugly uniforms. The service is minimal with one meal on a transatlantic flight and most of the flight you could not find the flight attendants other than in the galley. I have also never experienced a flight with so many passengers with bladder problems. Of course they don't go to the airport bathrooms to them it is much nicer to go in the plane so minutes after take-off they start to go and go and go. Make sure you sit far away from the bathrooms or better yet fly a better airline.

We flew from Ireland with our 9 month old baby and I was 29 weeks pregnant the staff were great we had flown to Ireland with a different carrier but because of the lack of facilities for our little one we decided to let our return trip expire and book new flights with Aer Lingus there is nothing bad I can say about this airline they make you feel comfortable and were so good with our little one we were even given a bassinet for him to sleep in. I highly recommend to anyone with small children.

29 March 2015. I was booked to go YYZ-DUB yesterday. Flight was cancelled. I checked in at 3pm and left the airport at 12.15am after being added to same flight today. Checked in today at 3pm the line was packed with passengers enough for two flights. The staff checked in all but 9 of us who happened to be from yesterday's cancelled flight. A long time later they managed a flight to London Heathrow tonight with Air Canada boarding at 10.40 pm. I'm going to arrive in Heathrow at 11am and board an Aer Lingus flight for Dublin arriving at 2.45 tomorrow. I'm really not sure what to do when travel goes pear-shaped but Aer Lingus oversold the flights and nine of us unrelated and obviously not aggressive or over-assertive ended up in a horrendous nightmare. I've spent two day times in Pearson airport.

Flew back from Dublin to Orlando on a less than satisfactory airplane (previously used by Iberia Airlines). The plane was very cramped with seats very close to the seats in front the width of the seats were very narrow! My seat didn't recline at all. It was loose and broken. The staff were rude and inefficient etc.. All this hell on an 8.5 hour journey at least.

### Aer Lingus customer review
I fly LGW-DUB-LGW every fortnight. The crew are always extremely friendly considering it is 06.50am and 20.50 on the return. The service is great and they always smile & welcome everyone on board unlike the other Irish airline. However one major concern from the end of March '15 the 06.50 flight will cease to operate and the first flight of the day to Dublin will be at 09.10 which is useless for those of us going to work in Dublin.

### Aer Lingus customer review
Flew Dublin Boston with 3 month old two year old and husband. Having informed infant travelling and confirmed bassinet seat boarded plane to be told sorry not bassinet row after all. Plane change the previous evening and row numbering differed with new aircraft and bassinet rows were not allocated appropriately for new aircraft. We were lucky that kind passengers (with no accompanying infants) eventually gave up their bassinet row seats. Contacted Aer Lingus before the return leg of the journey to request bassinet row for the journey home - customer service response was poor in relation to the matter. When we checked in on flight home and we requested to be sat together if possible we were informed there were four children travelling in bassinet seats and my husband would have to sit in row behind me (my 3 month old) and my two year old. We were fine with this as we understood priority to be given to adults with accompanying infants but once we boarded flight it became obvious one bassinet row occupied by 2 infants (our row) and the other bassinet row given to adults with no accompanying infants. It would have made our trip home a little easier to have been seated together as anyone with children knows. We travelled from the UK to Dublin to support Irish company but we will not fly with Aer Lingus again. Previous travel for us with British Airways to US was predictable and turned out to be superior. It is a pity.

Economy flight return from Dublin to New York. No complaints about either flight. Both departed on time. Arrival in New York as a 'domestic' passenger is a real bonus. Flight out was on an Airbus with a 2-4-2 configuration which was nice. Return flight was on a 757 with an Air Contractors Shannon based crew (according to the announcement). Seating was not as good but as it was less than 6hrs back not an issue. Entertainment channels were fine. Food served was perfectly acceptable.

Flights FRA-DUB return. Overall a good experience with Aer Lingus. Flights were on time seat comfort ok and staff very good. Food and drinks only for purchase but prices are fair and quality is good. Had a pre-ordered Irish breakfast on my flight to Dublin which was very good. Only minus was the cleanliness at my seat on the return flight to Frankfurt my table was full of chocolate and the window was dirty too.

### Aer Lingus customer review
Overall surprisingly a great experience - emphasis on the surprise. Flying Boston to Edinburgh with a layover in Dublin. Checked in online was almost immediately sent an email and text informing me my flight was delayed 40 minutes. Arrive at the airport and am continuously informed of further delays. The plane was late getting in and they flipped it as quickly as they could somehow managing to get fresh blankets and pillows in every seat although they did not have time to get fresh headsets on board before takeoff. By the time we got off the ground we were 2 hours behind schedule. Despite this we were informed that we would only be half an hour behind schedule due to favorable weather. This was not the case we were over an hour late. Upon arrival in Dublin almost everyone on the plane were given tickets for new flights since literally all of us missed our connections due to the delays. I was booked on the next flight out of Dublin (which was still a 5 hour wait) and given vouchers in 5 euro increments for breakfast as compensation for the inconvenience. Everyone with whom I spoke during the delay the confusion and the ticket transferring was absolutely a joy seriously one of the best customer service experiences I have had while flying. The food on the flight was great for airline food and in the course of a 5 hour flight we were given a beverage and snack service dinner coffee/tea and morning juice. For the price you really just can't beat it.

### Aer Lingus customer review
Dublin to JFK. The pre US clearance actually makes the flights more confusing as you have to give yourself over 2 hours to clear that area then find the appropriate gate. This is NOT printed on your boarding card and the distances in this airport are lengthy. Business class desk woman was extremely rude and so were the 2 customer service desk attendees that I dealt with to change my flight. Internet has never worked on these flights for me my vegetarian requests have been missed 4 out of 5 times and the general level of Irish customer service is extremely low. They speak to you as if it is a privilege to pay them to fly with them. Do not fly with Aer Lingus if you need to ask a representative for anything. They are understaffed and the employees are not helpful in general. Fend for yourself with this cheap airline.

DUB-JFK - December 2014. Third time flying Business with EI most flights are economy and this was a treat for our wedding anniversary. From Dublin - check in efficient lounge pleasant US immigration took minutes. Boarded first and welcomed with a glass of champagne. Crew chatty and attentive. Lovely meal and a few hours sleep on the near flat beds. I understand this year they will move to fully flat. Arrive in JFK as a domestic passenger so seamless to public transport or a cab. Flying back was excellent too. Slept most of the flight. Crew in good spirits but not as good as the crew out on the 17th (4pm flight). Overall top marks.

### Aer Lingus customer review
SNN-BOS: I booked the flight on the Aer Lingus website and the cost was very reasonable. Check in was quick and efficient in less than 5 minutes same with security and US Immigration which is a real bonus. The flight was operated by Air Contractors for Aer Lingus 757 which is a smaller aircraft to the traditional A330 Aer lingus used to use on the route. I chose to sit in the back cabin of the aircraft as most people were sitting up at the front and the middle of the aircraft the few of us at the back had a row of three seats each. The seat pitch was fine (and mush better compared to the Qantas A380 which I was on two weeks prior). The pre order meal is well worth the extra money especially for the west bound flight it includes wine and has proper cutlery and is served on porcelain and the meal is served individually before the standard meals. In-flight entertainment was touch screen (there was no remote and the head sets is plugged into the side of the screen) with a good choice of movies: there are some new releases and a good few classic movies with the usual array of sitcoms music and the in-flight map. Crew were friendly and professional throughout the flight chatting with the passengers throughout the service. There was a small snack of a large flapjack with tea or coffee before landing. Overall a good service comfortable aircraft (despite the smaller size of the 757 there was a nice area near the aft restrooms to stretch your legs) good seat pitch (I am 6 ft) and it is well worth upgrading your meal.

City break to (CDG) Paris just before Christmas. Friendly crew who handled the flight in an efficient no nonsense manner. Both legs departed and arrived in time. Approx 75% full with a mix of business leisure and Disney visitors. Buy on board food is reasonably priced and the pre-order Irish breakfast was delicious. Fare was just €100 return. Recommended.

EI 774/775 Dublin-Agadir-Dublin. Travelled 20 December - aircraft named the St Albert found the crew in both directions excellent. However the aircraft was old grubby and very tired looking it seems to be used on "leisure" destinations (a bit like the old charter style operations) the seat pitch is definitely narrower than their other aircraft and there was no seat pockets I'm accustomed to not having them on Ryanair and don't mind but on a 4 hour flight it's awkward. Ordered pre-order meals - they were ok I'm still not a fan of Clodagh McKennas inflight menu but it filled the gap. Unless you are in the 1st 3 rows they don't generally have much left when they come around. As I had booked wheelchair assistance for my mother I wasn't surprised that on arrival Swissport who do the handling do not have any lifts to take the passengers off the flight this is a regular occurrence at Agadir out of Aer LIngus's remit I reckon. Overall Aer Lingus is continually good.

JFK-DUB - First time flying Aer Lingus transatlantic and being Irish was looking forward to the service having previously flown Delta BA and Air France. I have to say I was pretty disappointed. It may be a good service to those who haven't flown other airlines long haul. I found the seats cramped and uncomfortable. The PTV touchscreen was very unresponsive. They went around and gave one measly plastic cup of soft drink and advised those who wanted to "buy" wine for dinner they better do so now. Dinner arrived around an hour later (way too late as on a night flight everyone wants to get some sleep). By the time dinner came everyone had obviously finished their drinks and couldn't get another one with their dinner. The cabin crew didn't look too happy. When dinner was handed out and rubbish collected they disappeared for the rest of the flight. No water nothing. In comparison I flew Delta out and they were miles better complimentary wine with dinner (and a second and third if you wanted it). They came around with free drinks very soon after take off and dinner promptly after that. They served drinks with dinner and were very attentive throughout the rest of the flight handing out refreshments. They were also very friendly. I will not fly Aer Lingus transatlantic anymore when there are much better options. Management really need to look at what the competition are offering charging for things and being scabby on long flights is not really on in this day and age.

### Aer Lingus customer review
Recently travelled to Ireland via Heathrow on ANZ then partner airline Midland to Dublin. After 2 very enjoyable weeks in Ireland travelled Dublin to Edinburgh with a party of 20 on Aer Lingus. 16 had an extra bag booked and all those were well underweight. One person had an extra bag not overweight but not booked for which the additional charge was 320 euros. This was negotiated down to 270 euros and we were advised that the charge would have been wiped had we flown into Ireland using Aer Lingus. To put the extra charge in perspective the price of a return ticket plus bag on the net that day was 119 euros. This experience detracted from our visit and does not seem a good way to engender goodwill towards the airline.

### Aer Lingus customer review
First time Aer Lingus trip. SFO to DUB (and back this is a review of both trips). Ticket was over 1000USD so I was very surprised that drinks and snacks were not free except soft drinks and a tiny bag of pretzels. I have never experienced this on an international flight before. Food was pretty bad mostly tasteless slop for the main meal and an insulting muffin and coffee/tea for "afternoon tea" which was literally thrown at some people. We could watch movies/TV free but the headset quality was atrocious we couldn't hear clearly (same for announcements which could be a safety hazard). I switched to my own headset so I can confirm that this was an airline problem. Attendants were inattentive - on the night time outbound trip they disappeared so no water could be had overnight (there was no-one at the back of the plane). They were also curt and unsmiling - except when I tried to board when they stopped the passengers immediately ahead of me and went into a whole "Irish" routine which went on for a while. The waiting masses were rolling their eyes at this. The seat-belt sign was on the whole trip so in the end we just ignored it. All in all I will try to avoid Aer Lingus from now on.

Glasgow to Dublin on Friday returned Sunday. Booked and paid for seats at the front of the plane only to find that the only exit is at the back. Not a major issue but annoying plus a complete waste of money on what was already an expensive flight. Delay on way back as gate was late opening all kept waiting at gate in absolutely freezing conditions. Cabin staff on way out were very friendly and gave lots of great advice on shopping in Dublin.

### Aer Lingus customer review
LHR-DUB-LGW was pretty good both ways with the outbound being delayed and inbound arriving early. Flight staff were always very nice and welcoming. Since this was a short flight the low-cost carrier side of the airline revealed itself quite a bit. Didn't experience any problems and would definitely fly with them again.

### Aer Lingus customer review
Dublin to Paris CDG return. I paid for a flexible ticket which costs more than twice the ordinary fare. By right this should be equivalent to business class fare. However Aer Lingus operates an economy only seating on this route. It used to include 2 checked bangs of 20 kgs each. Not anymore as you only get one 20kg bag now. With this fare you get lounge access but you still have to purchase food and drinks on the plane. Outbound flight was largely ok. On the return trip I was very annoyed to discover that the overhead bin was full and as I was on seat 1C there was no front seat I could put my small carry on luggage under. Eventually the stewardess managed to squeeze it in an overhead bin above the seat behind. I find this unacceptable as obviously no proper checks were carried out allowing people to carry disproportionately more stuff on board and thus depriving others from getting their fare share of space. It irritated me even more that I had paid over the odds to discover that there was no space for my small carry on luggage above my seat. I have to agree with strict policies regarding carry on luggage as is with Ryanair. I guess I will still continue flying Aer Lingus as there are not too many options on this route but Aer Lingus should probably have a small business class cabin so that those who pay more get that bit more for the extra they fork out for their ticket. Alas I am unlikely to see this in my lifetime. In summary I think the worst thing an airline can do is combining a low cost approach while still charging extra for which you don't get much more. If Aer Lingus wants to be a real low cost airline that's fine but don't charge more and give nothing much in return.

### Aer Lingus customer review
I recently flew Aer Lingus from Malaga to Dublin and then on to San Francisco again with Aer Lingus from Dublin the following day. I have never flown with Aer Lingus before but cannot fault either the flights or their customer service. We booked the enhanced meals on our return flights from Dublin to San Francisco and my only comment would be that although the outgoing meals were superb the incoming meals appeared to have been a little overcooked. Without exception all flights left on time and arrived early.

Flew EI111. Service I will admit was bad. I fly maybe 4 times a year with Aer Lingus on its European network and some people need to remember that we sadly have left the era of luxury air travel like the Great Swissair. Even flag carriers now have to cut costs. What you pay for on Aer Lingus is very cheap for the service compared to another low cost Irish airline.

We travelled Newcastle-Dublin-Chicago early October and chose Aer Lingus because of the option to do Immigration in Dublin. What a disappointment. At US Immigration in Dublin we were handed Customs Forms. The guy handing them out had no idea what they were for or who had to fill them in. The Immigration process however was fairly straightforward and much quicker than we've experienced in the US. Once on board what a disappointment. We waited almost two hours before the flight attendants came around with the drinks trolley. They only came around once in an eight hour flight. And we had to pay for the drinks. This is the first time we've had to do this on a Transatlantic flight. They never came around with complimentary water or juice. I asked the attendant for some water which she brought to me but when the lady in front asked for water she was told they'd stopped serving drinks!! Lunch was pretty grim and afternoon tea was a flapjack - pretty hard to swallow when you're thirsty! On a positive note when we landed in Chicago we collected our luggage and were on our way pretty quickly. The return overnight flight was no better then our flight from Dublin to Newcastle was delayed because of an incident in Dublin airport. We were sitting in a very cold aircraft for over an hour. The pilot said he would start the engines to warm the plane up - the propellors turned twice! When we got home I had a query and needed to speak to Customer Service. I filled in a Customer Service form - 4 weeks later I'm still waiting for a response.

LHR to DUB. Flew out of T2. As a Gold Circle member I used the lounge. The views and ambience is far superior to the old T1 lounge but the food is still pretty pathetic the exception being the coffee - there is a machine as well as a percolator. The flight was fine with one exception the seat pitch was incredibly tight. This is a refurbished plane with the magazine rack at eye level. I am only 5ft 4" but I still found the space very tight.

October 16. Business Class Orlando to Dublin and economy class connecting to Amsterdam. It is difficult to fault this airline. The quality and attitude of the flight attendants is remarkable. This was true even on the connecting economy flight to Amsterdam despite the seating being very tight and the flight was packed. Flights departed and left on time. Boarding was more chaotic as patrons waited while families with infants and those in wheelchairs boarded early but brought with them large extended families as well to take advantage of the early boarding. October 25 the return flight from Amsterdam only allows check in with KLM but Aer Lingus passengers find out too late that they cannot print boarding passes from the hotel but only at blue KLM machines in the airport. On return to Orlando in the time it took to walk for the gate to baggage Aer Lingus already had the bags on the conveyor belt. Now that's a first.

### Aer Lingus customer review
For an international carrier it must rate as the poorest value. The audacity of them to charge for alcoholic beverages and the gall of them to recommend you spend €18 odd on what they call a decent meal when most national carriers provide the same free. I was travelling with some friends from Australia and they were taken aback by the frugality of the meals and beverages. Not my favourite airline and would only travel with them if it was absolutely necessary. As the Irish have a habit of mimicking every other country don't know why they cannot take this on board.

3/10/14 London Heathrow to Dublin Flight EI155. I am fed up with the Aer Lingus bashing on this site. Whilst conceding that I am Irish and could be accused of bias on the number of occasions over the last few years I have flown with Aer Lingus I can truthfully say that the overall service has been outstanding. Flight delays are usually outside the control of the airline. The crews without exception have been warm friendly and totally professional. I have enjoyed flying with Aer Lingus and look forward to doing so again.

### Aer Lingus customer review
Flew CWL-DUB-JFK and YYZ-DUB-CWL business class. Had the opportunity to bid for upgrade which we did and was accepted. The flight from CWL was on Stobart Air new plane and surprisingly quite a bit of leg room and seat comfort. We chose this route so we could clear immigration in DUB which was very easy to do and then sit in the BC lounge until ready to fly. The trip over was great comfortable seats which laid flat wi-fi 5 course meal on real plates and a tasty snack before we landed. The cabin crew were delightful nothing was too much trouble. The IFE was ok I mainly listened to music which had some great artists on there and some relatively new releases. I did not watch a film as I was too busy playing email tag with friends taking advantage of the wi-fi. Arrived at JFK on time and breezed through the terminal to collect luggage and to meet our waiting transfer. Return journey YYZ-DUB-CWL. Business lounge in YYZ airport is run by KLM massive lounge with great selection of food and drinks. The return plane was a different configuration and older so BC was not as comfortable in my opinion. There were only 12 seats and 2 were empty we were in row 1 and the screen for the IFE was so far away I could barely see it. One member of staff to care for our needs she was rather offhand and sourfaced not like that smilers we had coming over. Dinner was served it was ok but not to the standard of the outward flight and the seats were not as comfortable due to the fact that when you did use the recline/lie flat you were placed at an angle that made you feel as if you were about to slide on the floor. During the flight I asked for a cup of coffee (I dont sleep) and she said I will be serving breakfast in 30 minutes would you like yours now I said no just the coffee. When she served breakfast she did not give me mine so had to ask when she replied "oh you said you did not want breakfast". When we arrived at DUB we had to go through security again despite having just gotten off a plane and only being in transit. Due to the plane being slightly late we only had 15mins to get to our gate. Our bags were scrutinised and my friends duty free was checked to see if the seal had been broken and the receipt matched with the label. Very irritating we did end up being slightly late to our gate (we had our boarding passes) but it was stress we could have done without. The flight back to CWL was with Stobart Air packed but no problems. All in all not bad for the price we paid as the outward journey balanced the return.

I flew from Chicago O'Hare to Dublin and from Dublin to Amsterdam and Amsterdam back to Dublin and Dublin back to O'Hare and I must say I was pleased with the airline. The food was good the entertainment was good and the leg room on the flights was great. Only issue I did have was from Amsterdam to Dublin because we arrived 30 minutes left and nearly missed our connecting flight from Dublin to O'Hare however we made it on time with all of our belongings. Will definitely use Aer Lingus again on any future trips to Ireland.

Kerry-Dublin-Kerry on 14th October. Flight is Aer Lingus Regional operated by Stobart Air. Flights departed and arrived on time and were relatively smooth. Transit through Kerry and Dublin airports (with no luggage) was easy. The aircraft was uncomfortably hot during the early morning flight from Kerry. Food was dreadful - a rock hard scone from 'Clodagh's Kitchen'. Not Clodagh's best bake! These are relatively minor though easily resolved quibbles in what is a very useful service.

Used the BHX-DUB flight taking about an hour and just wanted to say what a pleasant experience it was compared to the competition on this route. No check-in queue or problems even though I was late due to a delayed train. A relaxed and pleasant experience throughout. No being herded onto stairwells so that the airline can stick to its tight schedules - just walked straight onto the plane after a short wait. The plane itself was a newish ATR 72-600 with an easy-on-the-eye light grey/blue interior - not the oppressive yellow and blue of the competition. Also no jarring announcements or being pestered to buy scratch cards. National carriers are also often a small window on the country to which you are travelling so it was nice to have staff that were actually Irish. Terminal 2 in Dublin is also much easier than T1. A relaxing experience and good all round - well worth the extra few euros (although actually cheaper than FR for this particular trip).

Aer Lingus Flight 111 from Shannon to JFK on 1 Oct 2014. We found the flight attendants to be aloof and unprofessional. Several passengers asked for different things and the flight attendants would just "yes" them but never followed through with their requests. It was like they were playing a game - just yes them and don't deliver. Will look for alternate airlines on future flights. I have been flying for over 30 years and never experienced anything like this before.

### Aer Lingus customer review
The flight from JFK to DUB was good the food was very nice however the entertainment is very lacking compared to other carriers - old choices and not a big selection. On the return trip the cabin was freezing and delayed by an hour food wasn't good on way back and entertainment was the same.

Flew from Belfast City Airport to Palma. The flight was delayed on the way out although it was confirmed that this was due to the airport the plane was leaving to come to Belfast to pick us up and in the end it was only just over an hour due to a speedy turn around by Aer Lingus staff. The aircraft was clean and tidy and not at all tired looking a good job especially given the short turnaround time that staff had. Flight was comfortable with a decent enough level of leg room although the cabin did feel a little hot on both out and inbound flights. The food selection was decent and of a standard a little higher than I would have normally expected although perhaps in the grander scheme of things like most airlines a little pedestrian. The return flight was much the same no problems and nothing to further stress my wife and I while travelling with our toddler for her first time on a plane. Also a few days after landing I contacted Aer Lingus as we seemed to have misplaced a new pair of shoes we had bought in Palma airport for our daughter. Usually some airlines are impossible to deal with after the fact however Aer Lingus were helpful and really gave the impression they went the extra mile to see if they could locate our misplaced shoes.

Two flights the first EI 564 DUB-BCN and the other EI 739 PMI-DUB. The first took off late due to the late arrival of the aircraft which was the truth (refreshingly) as the aircraft only arrived 20mins before we were due to depart but the time was made up with a fairly quick two hour flight to BCN. Not a full flight so we had space to move and didn't have the usual cabin baggage issues. Took the cabin crew a while to get going with inflight service but they had everything we asked for. The crew were nice if a little robotic. Plane wasn't spotless but they were in a hurry to go again so understandable (it wasn't filthy either). The flight back was packed and the airport in Palma is awful one of the warmest airports I've set foot in. The usual issues with pax and their cabin baggage while this is not the fault of the crew it should be dealt with or pax should know how to stow their luggage efficiently. It seems to rather aggravate the cabin crew that they are reduced to baggage handlers and rightly too. Otherwise there were similar crew-bots to the ones on the way over. Did everything by the book and kept the lights low for anyone who wanted to sleep. As per usual the bags took an age to arrive and this seems to be quite a regular occurrence now. But as an experience but flights were absolutely fine and pretty good value for money.

### Aer Lingus customer review
Booking experience is horrific. We've flown with this airline 8 times this year and each time there are many mistakes in the booking process. Their website is worse than useless it throws a litany of errors and seemingly holding parts of your information input which confounds the website next time you access it. This last booking it lost seat reservations and despite many emails are unable to get a simple request like sitting together right. They charge for meals and don't provide them. Onboard all is well nice friendly staff on clean planes. Food is just acceptable. Best way is take your own and have a picnic. All our flights have been on time. Avoiding massive queues on arrival in US having immigration in Dublin makes flying to the US better than any other route. Advice? Book early and be prepared for a slow process.

### Aer Lingus customer review
Flight was from Toronto to Dublin. Seats were small and cramped. Drinks took forever to be served and were chargeable (on a transatlantic flight). Crew were very pleasant but there weren't enough of them and service was slow and poor. Food quality was poor - army standards. I am sure there are better airlines doing a better job - WestJet or Air Canada.

### Aer Lingus customer review
19th September flight out - People were loaded on quickly and efficiently - same old problem with baggage. Didn't book a seat on this occasion so ended up in row ten which is noticeably smaller than the first 5 rows. Unbelievably the woman in front reclined her seat (its a short flight) and reduced my space even further. Plane more or less on time however landed at terminal one and walked miles to terminal 2 - no logic. 21st September Sunday flight - Queuing had been slightly addressed but loading was held back because of there only being one member of staff instead of two checking in and people just being slow. Arrived late which led to a few people having to run the length of Gatwick to get to their trains. Its about time Aer Lingus loaded people from the front and back of the planes.

Flight #134 from Boston to Shannon on 9/1 and Flight #135 from Shannon to Boston on 9/9. We took Aer Lingus 757 contracted by Air Contractors. The price was right but you get what you pay for. The food was worse than TV dinners the stewardesses were so unfriendly (on both flights) and the TV's did not work on the flight back so we could not watch movies. My friend took the Aer Lingus airbus and said the food was fabulous and they had a wonderful experience. We could not say the same. Next time we would take the airbus.

We travelled from Orlando FL to Edinburgh via Dublin on 2 Sep 14 (FLT 120) and returned to Orlando on 13 Sep 14 (FLT 121). Both flights were the worst that my wife and I have experienced. The flight attendants were rude inefficient unprofessional inattentive and were completely aloof to what was going on around them. For example I pushed our flight attendant buzzer at least 10 different times to no avail. We were completed ignored. The food service was a farce and disgrace. One passenger wanted a blanket asked for a blanket but never received one. Another passenger asked for a cup of tea several times and after 30 mins or so it finally arrived. At times you could not even find a flight attendant. We will probably never fly Aer Lingus again.

We travelled from the Boston US to Ireland on an emergency trip. We flew on August 21 and returned today Sept. 5. Staff were excellent on both flights. We are traveling again in December and we look forward to much of the same. This was a short notice flight so it was a little pricey.

Recently travelled BOS-DUB RT. Love the airline but cost cutting is making the experience disappointing. Very tight seating with poor recline. Entertainment system not up to par with other transatlantic carriers. Flight attendants were exceptionally kind and friendly.

Sunday 31 Aug flight DUB to Gatwick. Completely amazed as on time! The usual nonsense over passengers having far too much hand luggage - and despite being the posher version of travellers - not a single ounce of common sense with how to put luggage in overhead bins prevailed with the over-made up chef stewardess threatening to place a case in the hold.

### Aer Lingus customer review
YYZ to DUB to EDI return. Transatlantic flights were excellent good IFE system pleasant staff and acceptable food. Big problem was connection in Dublin long walk through terminal and had to clear security again even though we were in the flight connection route. This does not happen at Heathrow so not sure why Dublin can't fix it. We were running to make the Toronto flight as security had only 1 of 3 lanes open.

### Aer Lingus customer review
I travelled business class from Orlando to Dublin. The seats do not recline fully and you are in close proximity to your seatmate. The food is coach class. Do not sit in first row as the attendants go in and out of galley but always fail to close the curtain when they go in and out. Returning to Florida and had to go through JFK and connect to JetBlue who does not have business class so you are in the way back in coach . You can pay extra for a seat closer to the front with extra leg room but of course Aer Lingus does not arrange that. Basically paying for 3/4 business class.

### Aer Lingus customer review
LHR - Shannon A319 - Aer Lingus bought these aircraft from Portugal and promised to reconfigure the seating but have not done so. Seat rows after 9 are extremely uncomfortable for any one over average height. Flight crew were aware of this but according to discussions multiple customer complaints have not had any impact. Select a forward row for comfort.

### Aer Lingus customer review
Well what to say a single Business Class flight to JFK from Dublin. Ordinarily I would hate such flights but the price and nature of the Aer Lingus flight was exceptional the cabin crew were dedicated and tended to my every need providing a friendly a fun flight to New York. The seats were very comfortable and I was greeted with champagne upon arrival the inflight entertainment was highly varied with some real classic films as well as many block buster movies and TV shows. The flight departed on time. The only slight drawback currently is the fact the seats do not lie completely flat that being said you still have more than enough room to relax. When I raised this with staff they discussed how their will apparently soon be changes made to put in place those seats that do lie completely flat as other airlines have begun to put them into place. Overall the flight was incredibly relaxing and I would book long haul with Aer Lingus in a heartbeat for flying out of Dublin the service is exceptional and business class was an unforgettable experience.

Have flown with Aer Lingus round trip from Boston to UK 3 times prior to our flight in August. The return trip from Dublin to Boston was not what we usually experience with Aer Lingus. The flight attendants were not helpful. They were slow distributing the snack which turned out to be only drinks didn't offer anyone a snack. They did not hand out blankets. Told passengers to get them themselves. Distributed the meal slowly and it was well into the flight before we ate. Ran out of choices so we got stuck with a beef meal that was inedible. The flight encountered some turbulence so seat belt naturally went on. Yet the pilot took his time turning that sign off when the turbulence cleared. It seemed like we were confined to our seats for most of the trip. That also seemed to make the attendants happy. They did not appear to enjoy their job at all that flight!

### Aer Lingus customer review
Went back to US on an 11.50 am flight from Dublin to Boston. Worst flight I have had. 3 out of 6 hours of my flight was spent having to listen to a toddler with his non-stop and very loud crying which the parents didn't exert much effort to stop on top of a seat that doesn't recline. My back hurts so bad. This is just one of the minor things the airline should have a regular maintenance check on to provide more comfort to their customers specially for a long flight.

Travelled from Birmingham UK to Dublin on Flt EI263. This flight was strictly ok and seemed like one of cheap airlines. It was a short flight but the passengers were very loud noisy but our connecting flight from Dublin to SFO Flt EI147 was a nightmare. After two security checks and a very slow US immigration Customs we went to the gate and the flight was delayed 90 minutes. Once on the plane it was freezing cold and there were no blankets on the seats for passengers. Cabin crew kept saying the heat would start soon but that never happened. We were travelling with kids and they were shivering. After repeatedly complaining the staff gave us some extra blankets which helped a little bit. We had ordered Hindu Vegetarian meals but we were given meals with chicken as they had no veggie meals onboard and nobody was apologetic. On this long flight we were given only one tasteless meal that the kids hardly ate and one snack bar before landing. No snacks or treats for kids during the flight. Vowed never to fly Aer-Lingus again.

NCL-DUB-NCL (Operated by Stobart Air). Short hop across the Irish Sea. By far a more preferable experience to that offered by Ryanair: no check in queue pleasant staff on-time boarding and departure and arrival into the new Terminal 2 at Dublin airport. Bags also delivered rapidly at both ends. On-board the (brand new) ATR aircraft the seats were comfortable and spacious. A bar and snack service (for cash) was offered. The only slight niggle was the ridiculously long Aer Lingus check in queue on the return home (Sunday evening). 50 minutes from start to finish. They do have a 'late check-in' desk and regularly have to announce flights that are closing and direct people to this desk to avoid missing flights!

Flew from Dublin to Palma Majorca. Flight left at 7.30am about 6-7 drunken young men allowed to board. One fellow spent the whole 3 hours of the flight yelling back and forth to his buddies swearing every second word it seemed and there were small children sitting right in front of him. Everyone around very uncomfortable. Three hours of drunken louts around us and staff incapable of dealing with them they continued to serve them alcohol. He wasn't met at the arrival gate by security like he would have been in most places. After the horrible flight our luggage did arrive but it did take almost an hour to arrive at luggage collection so not sure if that was Aer Lingus or airports fault. No onboard flight entertainment (3 hour flight would have been nice) and food was all to be paid for but that's ok since it wasn't a long flight. Flight was cheap so would recommend airline for that reason only. But the other low cost airlines we flew on were all cheap too and better.

My wife daughter and I travelled from Gatwick to Chicago via Dublin on 23rd July. The flight to Dublin had 'no frills' but was more comfortable than a recent flight on another Irish budget airline. The 3 hours transfer time at Dublin was partially taken up with clearing US immigration and the rest with sitting waiting for the on time flight to Chicago. The cabin crew were mature and efficient and the meal was very acceptable and served two hours into the flight. When we arrived on time in Chicago because all the paperwork had been done we were able to walk out of the airport without hassle after collecting our baggage. The return flight on 14th August had a younger cabin crew who provided a more lively friendly but equally efficient service. The Beef meal was very tasty and the cheese and ham croissant just before landing was welcome. A word of warning during the transfer at Dublin outbound and inbound further scanning was carried out on our hand baggage. The duty free bottle was accepted as the seal on the bag had not been broken and we had the receipt but a small bottle of wine from the aircraft which I had kept to drink later was confiscated even though it was unopened. I had read some of the 'horror reviews before flying but our experience did not match them and we would happily fly with the Aer Lingus again. The moderate inconvenience of transferring in Dublin was worth it to save at least £200 pounds each on a direct flight.

We flew Aer Lingus for our trip to Europe. We are a family of 4 with extensive travel experience. The tickets were not very cheap to begin with. We wanted to fly into London and fly out of Paris. For this the fare difference between Aer Lingus and Virgin British Airways was about $25-40 per person. Having flown with them I have now decided it would have been better to have flown with BA or Virgin. The flight from SFO to DUB and back is a long haul flight. On this flight we were offered one meal and one breakfast bar. The staff don't ask for Water or any other beverage from time to time. I saw other passengers bringing their own food drink etc.. They are probably used to traveling on this airline and are adequately prepared. The quality of entertainment is poor and the system they use is slow to respond. From time to time it hangs and we had to ask the crew to reboot the system. I guess we have been used to superior service from BA Singapore Airlines Cathay Air New Zealand and were disappointed even though the difference pricewise was not much. Speaking for myself and family we will not fly Aer Lingus again even if they offer a cheaper price.

### Aer Lingus customer review
Sunday flight 19.00 17/8. I dread going home with Aer Lingus as there is usually a scrum to get on the plane as the regulars do not understand the meaning of the word queue and the staff don't control the amount of luggage each passenger takes onboard leading to the ritual scratching of heads when their oversized hand luggage doesn't fit in the overhead locker and delay as bags have to be stowed. Why does this continue? When eventually the passengers were on board (it takes forever as many cant count) we then had to listen to the captain boasting about how he was going to get us there early - of course he didn't. Cut the showing off - control the passengers hand luggage and teach them and the staff some manners. Far too expensive for this nonsense - get professional.

### Aer Lingus customer review
Firstly do not be tempted to sit in seats 31 E D F G or 29 A C H I on the Dublin to Boston route the Aer Lingus website will not show that these seats do not recline. I flew Aer Lingus DUB-BOS-DUB in August 2014. It has good staff reasonable planes and routes. But it is really badly let down by its archaic web site with no access to your booking or seat selection before check in tacky interiors with seat pockets hanging off cramped seats some the worst airplane food I have ever had the misfortune to eat. On my transatlantic flight I ended up sitting for 6 hours on the way out in a seat that didn't recline with the person in fronts seat wedged in my face. On the way back I was determined not to let this happen again so chose a middle aisle seat with apparently (on the online check-in website) had seats behind and in front However instead I got a lovely seat beside the toilet which didn't recline as there was a bulkhead behind not shown on their plan. Online check-in is worthless as you still have to queue up in Boston and your carefully printed ticket is torn up and binned. Overall the whole experience was so poor I would much rather go with an airline that actually wants to give passengers a reasonable experience even if it takes a few hours longer to get to my destination.

### Aer Lingus customer review
I use to fly with Ryanair back and forth from Dublin every few weeks. After Ryanair changed their flight times to Dublin which did not help me I changed to Aer Lingus. The staff are friendly and always smiling the planes are comfortable and the times of the flights are fantastic. The prices are always a little higher than the other company's but I would not change back.

First and last time I will fly Aer Lingus. Returning from New Zealand I flew Air NZ Premium Economy to SFO (normally I go All Air NZ AKL to SFO/LAX to LHR-Belfast). However this trip I availed of Aer Lingus' new service from SFO to DUB to cut out a flight. Seats were incredibly cramped and uncomfortable with very small seat pitch and minimal recline which the passenger beside me commented on also as they boarded. Food was utterly disgusting my alleged beef Stroganoff actually tasted worse than it looked which was no mean feat I didn't even attempt a 2nd mouthful. Wine was extra $5USD. For a long haul flight costing over $900USD one way I think this is a bit mean "breakfast" was a joke a cling film wrapped ham and cheese roll and about 100ml of water in a foil sealed plastic tub tossed out. The whole experience just felt like a cost-cutting exercise. IFE was average/poor small selection of mostly dated material. I would advise anyone going for a long haul fly out of London on one of the better carriers.

### Aer Lingus customer review
Our flight on July 31 was a very poor experience. Passengers on flight 661 from Vienna to Dublin were left stranded at the gate for close to two hours past the posted departure time. Monitors in the area claimed the flight to be on time. There we absolutely no Aer Lingus or any other airport employees in the gate area during this time. The security personnel-the only non passengers we could access - refused to assist the passengers as we all became increasingly frustrated at the lack of information. We made phone calls to the Vienna airport (they must share the blame for this debacle as well) and Aer Lingus. No one offered any help whatsoever. Aer Lingus has apparently trained their employees to respond to any question or concern with a very irritating reply: "We understand that you are frustrated". This is all we heard from Aer Lingus employees throughout this flight. Not one Aer Lingus employee responded with appropriate action. At check in we were promised help with a seating request that I had tried to manage multiple times before arrival. No help was ever provided. The hot meal was frustrating as well. Many passengers were left with no option for the meal. This is no way to respect paying customers. We will avoid Aer Lingus in the future as it is apparent that they are in no way interested in appropriate customer service.

Berlin SXF - Dublin on 31st July another delayed departure due to passengers bringing oversized wheelie bags into the cabin and then struggling to find space and in some cases lift them into the overhead lockers. I saw one lady bring on a case large shopper and two large plastic bags! I had checked in a bag and placed a duty free bag in the overhead bin asked to remove it and place it at my feet so a passenger could place a large case in there - flatly refused. This is not the first time this has happened and ruins an otherwise usually pleasant journey compared with the other main airline operating out of Dublin. Come on Aer Lingus get tough with those bringing on excessive amounts of baggage and stop trying to penalise those of is who pay to check in luggage.

Dublin to San Francisco return. Outward journey via Boston (second leg with Jetblue which was great) as the direct flight was sold out for days around my date of travel. Thankfully got one of the last seats on the direct flight on the return journey. Business class wasn't in the budget for this trip but the seats in economy were fine (I'm 6'0'' tall). I ordered one of the special meals for the Boston flight which was well worth it had the regular meal from SFO to DUB which was fine and you could help yourself to drinks and snacks from the galley at any time. The service is consistent the aircraft's always immaculate the personal entertainment has plenty of choice and the staff generally very friendly and helpful. You can select most seats on the aircraft for free at time of booking. Lets hope AL go daily on this route in 2015.

More or less the same on the way back but T1 at Heathrow looking tired. Although I'm happy to use Aer Lingus again in the near future and will be great to see the end of T1 at Heathrow when they move to the new terminal!

### Aer Lingus customer review
We have been flying with Aer Lingus since 1999 and until last month we always considered it our favorite airline. The flight crew and planes have always been first rate and the food while never great was at least passable. On our flight (EI-111) from Shannon to JFK we were served a meal that was quite possibly the worst we have ever been served on any airplane. We opted for the chicken "dinner" that came with some sort of rice as well as something called "Spicy Salad" if I recall correctly. The salad was inedible. If this is the type of food we can expect from Aer Lingus in the future I can assure you that we will be looking for a different carrier on our next trip.

### Aer Lingus customer review
BRU-DUB. I am regular flyer on this route normally on 10.20am flights. What is going on with the re-instated check-in / bag drop queues at Brussels? I say re-instated because after online check-in finally came to BRU airport there have never been any issues with this flight in either checking in or dropping bag lines in Brussels. However last two times in June and this morning there were huge queues on both the Aer Lingus check-in line and bag drop/Gold circle line. And they both seem to advance eternally slow. Why does it seem to take so long per passenger to simply drop off a bag? I ended up getting fed up and bypassing altogether and brought my bag through security and got it checked at gate which is an added nuisance but one time I had skipped breakfast and really needed to get past security to eat something before collapsing. I am not sure what is causing the problem but there seems to be some ambiguity about the queuing lines for the check-in and bag drop / gold circle and people just seem to pass no heed of which is the correct line and join one or the other whichever is shorter. I think they need some better identification or barriers between the two to snake the queues to make it work better. Or a staff member guiding people correctly.

Have taken Aer Lingus from the US (Chicago and NY) several times and am very impressed. The planes are new the seats reasonably comfortable (good leg room and we are tall people) the food fine and good selections on the personal TV/Movie screens. No problems with being on time staff was friendly and efficient. I was especially impressed when we got into Dublin a bit late and were personally escorted through the lines in order to make our connection on to Paris. Never had that happen with any airline before! I would fly Aer Lingus again.

LHR-SNN 17th June 2014. I used to travel Aer Lingus on this route quite regularly however since experiencing the leg room on the A319 I see no reason now to chose Aer Lingus over Ryanair when travelling from London to Shannon. I am 6'1" and I literally could not fit my legs in to the seat. Luckily I was in the aisle however kept having to squeeze my legs in when the trolley came past. I am aware these are former Iberia aircraft hence the reason for the difference between the leg room in the A320 and the A319 however I feel Aer Lingus should have reconfigured the A319 to provide a consistent product between aircraft. I travelled in row 7 on the outbound leg of this journey (which was the former business class area for Iberia) and had more than enough leg room. Beware of travelling in the rear of the aircraft on the A319. Very unpleasant flight and I just about managed to put up with it for the hour duration of this flight. I could not imagine sitting in these seats for any longer.

Flew from JFK to Shannon then Heathrow on June 7/8 then from Gatwick to Dublin to JFK on June 22. My husband is a retired Air Traffic Controller and said we were flying Aer Lingus or Icelandair only so we flew Aer Lingus. Loved it! The stewards were very nice and the crew were funny even in announcements. We did not upgrade the meal but they were great except on the way back I asked for the beef dish and she gave me the chicken which had curry and I can't eat curry. After finally getting her to stop and listen they were out of beef. I slept most the way anyway.

Flew BRS-DUB-YYZ then YQG-YYZ-DUB-BRS in June 2014 as it was convenient to fly from our home airport rather than drive to London for a direct flight. Could not check in online as we had not booked directly with airline which meant an early start at the airport and no seats together. BRS-DUB with Stobart and a tiny noisy twin-prop as you might expect for such a short flight. DUB-YYZ plane looked brand new - think this route had only just started flying - and was full. 3-3 configuration felt very cramped. Drinks and food OK but not served until about 2 hours into the flight and no pre-landing snacks left by the time they got to us on the back row - we were offered a selection of biscuits instead. Service was fine apart from this. IFE selection limited and touchscreen system somewhat temperamental. Not a full-service airline so alcoholic drinks had to be paid for (we were prepared and brought euros just for this). On return YQG-YYZ sector by Air Canada - checked bags through to BRS for us. YYZ-DUB was a night flight but drinks and food again served after 2 hours water on board not working so no tea or coffee (or water in the toilets) lights not dimmed at all though a blanket and pillow were provided. Flight seemed to be on time leaving but arrived 30 mins late though no there was no mention of this or apology from the crew. It was only on the very long walk from the gate that we realised there'd been a delay and had to run then be fast- tracked through security just getting to the gate for our connecting flight as it closed behind us. Needless to say our bags didn't follow us for a couple of days. You get what you pay for and Aer Lingus were a little cheaper and a lot more convenient than other airlines for us. For a 7hr flight they were fine and I might be tempted by the convenience of the DUB US immigration pre-clearance to fly to NYC or Boston with them but I wouldn't travel any further.

### Aer Lingus customer review
A comfortable flight crew were pleasant but not much seat room. A little costly compared to other airlines with no direct flight from Toronto to London. Baggage amount was reduced to regional amount on way back to Toronto as we flew from Newcastle yet it was International amount from Dublin to London didn't make sense.

Belfast City to Heathrow on 24 May and return on 8th June A319 both ways. Found the seats hard and the leg room constrained compared to several flights of similar length on Bangkok Airways A319 in late May/early June. Would not like a three or four hour flight on these aircraft. Would only recommend if no alternative unlike EI long haul which I consider good.

BHX-DUB-JFK. We booked Aer Lingus because it was the most cost-effective option to New York from Birmingham with a short connection time. I was apprehensive above flying Aer Lingus based on previous reviews. The BHX-DUB sector was on an Aer Arran (now Stobart Air) ATR which was practically empty with overhead bins that accommodated carry- on's but the aircraft was very noisy. DUB-JFK was an A330 in 2-4-2 configuration. Seats and leg room were ok. Seat back TV entertainment was limited and not the most user friendly. Alcoholic beverages have to be paid for and there was only one round of soft drinks. The meal was mediocre and the pre-arrival snack was a flapjack. The crew constantly seemed in a hurry to distribute meals and drinks to the point where they practically chucked it at you before moving on. The crew then disappeared not to be seen until arrival. Whenever I fly transatlantic in economy I always seem to be disappointed. Nothing beats the middle eastern carriers on service. The only benefit of flying Aer Lingus is leaving from a local airport and the US pre-immigration clearance in Dublin which enables one to arrive in the US like a domestic passenger and avoid the lengthy immigration queues. Price however is comparable to other carriers.

Our return flight to the US from Edinburgh was not a good experience. We waited in line 55 minutes while one employee handled baggage and check in for the flight. While she assured us that we would make the flight it was a harrowing experience after we arrived at the airport 1 hour and 20 minutes early. At the gate one employee handled boarding and she had to check a number of bags because the overhead bins were inadequate for a typical carry on. We paid extra for upgraded meals which were terrible and I hate to think what those that did not upgrade had to eat. The attendants from Dublin to Orlando were no shows except for the meal service and a laughable cookie snack. I would never recommend Aer Lingus to anyone.

Airbus 330 Dublin to Orlando June 17th 2014. The A330 would be comfortable for a trip that lasts 4-5 hours tops definitely not as long as 8 hours. The Dublin to Orlando journey was very uncomfortable the seats are far too narrow the leg room is a minus and the arm rests are far too narrow. All in all a horrible journey. The flight was very smooth. The air hostesses were abrupt while trying to accommodate everyone. I will think twice before I book another long flight with Aer Lingus.

### Aer Lingus customer review
Flew from AGP-DUB on EI585 (A333) paid a bit extra to sit in Business class not sure how comfortable I'd be lying 'down' at that angle for a long period of time or if it's worth it. The entertainment screen can be pretty difficult to see if the shade is left up. EI should maybe roll out a business 'lite' for this route and throw free something or other into the mix but really it's quite a short flight so not hugely important but might be a nice touch. Bought a breakfast quite nice and filling. Crew the usual brand of EI pleasant. Usual happened on landing and has happened the last few times it's almost like someone has a peek out of a window and wonders what a plane is doing there as if it's a surprise. Waited an age to get on stand even though multiple were empty equally as long for a land bridge and then another 20 mins for luggage. Fine in the air but the ground needs work. Recommend all the same just don't be in a rush after landing.

### Aer Lingus customer review
I flew business class to Ireland for my vacation and I can say it was the best flight. It was all I thought it would be on Aer Lingus. The business class seating and all you get is worth the value in all areas. The service from the crew was great always seeing if you needed something if you were doing ok and keeping you updated.

### Aer Lingus customer review
Travelled LGW-YYZ business class. My first trip with Aer Lingus long haul and I was not sure what to expect. The experience was just perfect. Business cabin has only 12 seats plenty of room for storage. I had no neighbour making feel well isolated for a quiet flight. Sleeping was comfortable although the not fully flat bed is a bit tricky to handle at first. Food was one of the best I had on the many airlines I've flown with. Finally staff were very careful smiling and professional. I would definitively fly again with them. The only point to improve would be a better dedicated business check-in at LGW.

Boston to Shannon March 9 (E10134). Shannon to Boston on March 18 2014 (E10135). I have been flying with Aer Lingus since I was a child and am never disappointed with the food service and hospitality offered. The planes are well kept and clean. The crew were so attentive - they define Irish hospitality.

### Aer Lingus customer review
Very disappointed Aer Lingus cancelled our flight from Dublin to Boston on May 30 and treated us very poorly on the rescheduled flight on June 2nd. I am in full support of the labor action by the crew but I will never recommend Aer Lingus to anyone. We were not seated together so we could not help each other with our bags and the crew could easily have rectified this at boarding. A six hour flight sitting eight rows apart! This was not necessary. We paid over $500 in extra expenses because of the strike and the best the cabin crew offered was an extra cup of tea which was very nice but not quite enough. Avoid Aer Lingus.

### Aer Lingus customer review
Flew with Aer Lingus to Boston on flight EI 139. Economy. Flew on the A330 to and from. Excellent plane. The cabin crew were very helpful and friendly. The meal on the plane going over was excellent it was off their new sky menu. I got the steak it was lovely. It was first class dining in economy class. It was well worth the €17.50 because that included a glass of wine. I would recommend getting this. Unfortunately I couldn't get this meal on the way back sold out. However the meal we got was still lovely. Overall would like to fly with Aer Lingus in the future again. Would recommend them.

### Aer Lingus customer review
Travelled on the Aer Lingus Regional ATR DUB-BRS-DUB return on Sat morning 7th May. Excellent service overall. Flights departed on time arrived early. The return was on one of the new aircraft. The Aer Lingus lounge in T2 is excellent and well worth the short detour. Only point to note is that all the Regional flights take off from the one gate in Dublin T2. You proceed downstairs onto the same level as US pre clearance through gate 412. I almost missed the bus over to the morning flight only for the fact that a ground staff called out 'anyone else for Bristol'. The screen at the gate advised next flight was the BRS flight and the Glasgow was boarding first. So perhaps they need to look at that or advise that there is a short bus ride over to the aircraft. Otherwise well recommended Vs the competition and the fare was excellent value for a short flight.

### Aer Lingus customer review
Using the Manchester-Shannon route weekly when it 's working it's great and staff are good - but reliability is patchy and when things go wrong Aer Lingus customer service is dreadful to non-existent. Last week reached Manchester 6 hours late following an unscheduled stop at Dublin. Technical difficulties again! No sense whatsoever of Aer Lingus trying to minimise the effect on passengers. They need better more reliable planes or much better customer service or perhaps if it wouldn't be too much to ask both!

### Aer Lingus customer review
Dublin to Cardiff return. I have used the Friday evening and return on Sunday night frequently over the last two years. They have recently had more new planes (ATR 72) prior to this the flights were invariably a few hours late. However they are now mostly less than one hour late. Service from the crew is good for a one hour flight. Parking at a remote stand in Dublin then having a bus transfer plus a lengthy walk to Arrivals. Would be good if Ryanair returned to this route.

### Aer Lingus customer review
Flew from Bristol to Dublin for the Giro D'Italia using Aer Lingus Regional (Aer Arran). Boarding on the outward and return was calm and civilised and the ATR aircraft clean and comfy enough for a short hop. Check-in staff and the crew onboard were polite and there was an adequate range of snacks and drinks for purchase onboard. Terminal 2 at Dublin was smart and stylish. The only drawback was the long lines for check in and bag drop on the return flight but there were a large number of people travelling that day - many returning after the Giro.

### Aer Lingus customer review
Flew Barcelona-Toronto via Dublin. First time on Aer Lingus and the biggest draw was the excellent fare. Having said that I won't recommend except for bargain hunters. BCN-Dublin is basically a low cost flight curiously more comfortable than the 757 they used for the transatlantic leg. This must be the narrowest twin-engine plane around very narrow seats (and I'm on the slim side) and little legroom on top of that. I heard many people commenting on the lack of space. The personal entertainment system is not bad although only a few recent releases plus some shows and documentaries and music and maps. Food on the outbound flight was awful and made me ill afterwards so I avoided it on the inbound and brought my own food. Drinks service is seriously cheap no free alcohol and just water orange juice or Coke/Sprite available. Crew was friendly but never followed up on the one occasion (each flight) I went to the galley to ask for something even though they said they'd bring it to my seat. Transfer at Dublin was easy but with a lot of walking. I won't fly this particular route with them again.

### Aer Lingus customer review
I myself am a frequent flyer. I live in Paris but my family lives in Cork. Aer Lingus is the only airline to offer a direct link to Cork from Paris. The staff always have a smile when you travel. Food is nice their is no In flight entertainment screens but its OK for a 1 hr 40min flight.

### Aer Lingus customer review
I have travelled with various airlines out of Dublin in the past haven taken a break from Aer Lingus. However recently I flew with them to Munich and have to say I was very impressed overall with the service. I checked in on my mobile presented my boarding card on my mobile and had no problems using it getting through security. The aircraft was an A320 I was seated at row 12a which was an emergency exit so I had plenty of leg room on way out. Food was of good quality although I would have liked even a complimentary tea or coffee instead of 2.50 but only a small negative. On my return home the journey was a little more eventful which ended with me collapsing in the middle of the cabin. I can not commend the cabin crew enough for looking after me and administering the necessary first aid etc to ensure I was safe and comfortable. The crew were professional calm and reassuring which now looking back on it is what some other airlines are missing. I will definitely be a convert back to Aer Lingus.

### Aer Lingus customer review
Staff at airport and staff on plane all very professional great seats comfortable plenty of leg room and food lovely. I travelled with my 3 grandchildren from Dublin - Madrid return and found it a very enjoyable experience. Staff were lovely had great patience with customers. Only downside was Dublin airport had no facilities for children only the play area at Burger King which my children were too big for.

### Aer Lingus customer review
The plane sat on the tarmac for an hour (flight attendants even went through the safety announcement) before the pilot announced a problem with an engine that had to be tested. Another hour passed while they tested the engine. We then had to "deplane" because they couldn't fix the engine. We were herded onto another plane and they took us yet again through the safety procedures. Then they proceeded to offer us tea and coffee for which they charged 2.5 euros. Because of the delay I missed my international flight by half an hour. Nevertheless the flight attendants insisted all those with connecting flights go to the terminals where their flights had already left. I spent 3.5 hrs trudging through Heathrow trying to get home. Finally after going through security 3 times in one day I arrived back at the Aer Lingus desk at terminal one. They gave me a voucher for a hotel that they told me (and wrote on the voucher form) was in Terminal 4. It was in Terminal 5. Another hour of trudging around Heathrow trying to find the hotel. The new flight I was booked on did not leave for 24 hours. Aer Lingus is the worst airline I have ever experienced. Never travel with Aer Lingus.

### Aer Lingus customer review
I travelled from Amsterdam to Cork on the final leg of a code-share Business Class flight with KLM from Osaka Japan. The difference of the inflight experience between KLM and Aer Lingus was incredible: the Aer Lingus flight was actually an endurance. Indifferent cabin crew and no service whatsoever without paying. The only good thing is that KLM assigned me an aisle seat on the first row allowing me to disembark quickly when the flight arrived at Cork Airport.

### Aer Lingus customer review
LHR-BOS via DUB. They held the flight to DUB in order to fill all unsold seats which made us late for the plane to BOS. They had us run all over the airport 3 times and sent us to 4 different wrong desks staff were rude and patronising they did not listen to anything we said just printed new boarding passes and left us to waste 5 hours in DUB airport with no meal vouchers or anything. Seats were "downgraded" to much worse ones in the back plane flight attendance slept for most of the flight and I had to wait 20 mins to get some water to take some headache pills. Even worse on the way back we had to make a transatlantic flight in such a tiny plane that "low cost airlines" would have been ashamed of! And all in hellishly hot temperatures.

### Aer Lingus customer review
Flew the DUB-ORD route. I was disappointed with the movie selection offered by the in-flight entertainment. Compared to Delta there were far fewer movies to choose from and they were not current titles. Expect ones you've already seen 5 years ago. The hot meal was the usual chicken or beef options and was nothing to write home about. The pre-landing snack was a flapjack. They give you a knife and fork to eat it bizarrely. I guess this airline just loves wasting money. The armrests between seats do not go all the way up to prevent passengers lying down on a row of four. Annoying if you want to catch a quick nap. Overall I was disappointed with the flight given how much Aer Lingus charge for a one-way. I'll try another airline for the return journey.

### Aer Lingus customer review
SEN-DUB-SEN: Again very impressed with Aer Lingus Regional their new ATR aircraft are even better than before. Crew very attentive and flight on time both ways. Would definitely use them again instead of Ryanair from Stansted. Only gripe was hand luggage allowance. We were really restricted on what we could take onboard and had to end up purchasing another checked in bag so it was annoying when you see passengers with bags that well exceed the dimensions on their website carrying them on board.

### Aer Lingus customer review
Dublin-Malaga 7th April EI 584/585. Booked flex fare as it includes lounge access bags etc on this particular flight. Aer Lingus use the the Airbus 330 so you can reserve the seats normally used in Premier Class (economy service). All good nice crew as per previous comments the IFE is a bit of a joke even in the premier seats the remote control doesn't sync with the screen and the touch screen has to be "thumped" to get any reaction. Choice of movies and TV was poor but I didn't take the flight to view movies used my iPad. Onboard wifi available at 11.95 euros per hour return flight same good crew but I felt a little stretched as they now operate with minimum crew numbers of 8 on board as against 11 when I last flew this route. One comment I do have to make ..there has been huge media coverage on Aer Lingus launching their new "Bia" inflight menu by celebrity chef Clodagh McKenna someone should point out not everyone in Ireland is as addicted to cheese Ms McKenna appears to be! Every single sandwich and snack has one type of cheese or another added even on the pre-order meals it's a choice of cheese or more cheese. I'm a great believer in not trying to fix something that wasn't broken. Your old pre-order menu and onboard menu was edible! Take a tip from other airlines purchase on board menus. All in all Aer Lingus are good.

### Aer Lingus customer review
Tiniest most uncomfortable seats I have ever experienced! If you are tall forget any leg room or comfort! Unfathomable why arm rests do not totally lift up to increase possible passenger comfort! The chicken curry was frankly awful. Crew were more interested in socializing with each other than providing passenger service. There were times that the crew area sounded more like an Irish pub - loud and noisy! And then there is the fact that for all connecting Aer Lingus flights you must be re-screened for airline security! It took us an hour to clear Chicago security in order to make our connecting flight so allow additional time for this glitch! Aer Lingus may be a cheaper ride but I will not travel with them again!

### Aer Lingus customer review
Dublin-CDG return this was on a flex fare so not really in business class as such as business class is non existent on short haul flights. While the service from the cabin crew was friendly and efficient I note several issues that management needs to address. Flex fare entitles you to access to airport lounges. This needs to be made stress free for passengers. This time I received the invitation by email but as I had changed the dates as I am entitled to do I used the original lounge invitation (as no new invitation came by e-mail). No problems encountered in Dublin but while in Paris the staff in the Icare lounge came back to me while I was sitting down and eating to verify that the original lounge invitation reference matched my flight reference. I don't blame her as she was very apologetic for having had to do so. Surely if this is an issue for ground staff Aer Lingus should send a new invitation when you change the dates. In some previous flights the invitation did not come at all and Aer Lingus did not reply to my queries and there were issues getting access to the lounge without this "invitation". Perhaps Aer Lingus does not really bother with this as most people don't really bother with paying the higher flex fares. However for those who pay they should get what they pay for without any stress. I would also suggest that if you pay this fare you should at least be entitled to one meal and one drink on your flight since the fare costs 3 to 4 times more the cheaper fares. I will continue to use Aer Lingus as I live in Ireland and I find their cabin crew generally friendly and efficient but I hope management takes note of my comments and suggestions. If they don't address these issues they may find more and more people opt for their competitors like Ryanair.

Our flight from Belfast to Malaga was cancelled on the 8/4/2014 reasons unknown and we were moved to the 9th. This was unsuitable so I called the customer services and without any hassle we were moved to a flight departing Dublin for the original date. When we checked in via the self check in machine our pre booked seats had changed and when mentioned to the desk staff they quickly corrected our seats back to the original with a sincere apology. The morning flight was on an A330 the advantage to this was we had IFE for the short 3 hour flight but it was a welcomed bonus. Crew were friendly and accommodating to any request and seemed to enjoyed serving the customers with a smile even when it was a full flight. This was a faultless flight in every respect arriving at destination bang on time. I really can't fault this airline every single employee I had connect with either from the call center to the gate agents to the cabin crew made us feel welcomed. It is a shame that the return flight from Malaga to Belfast left to early for us otherwise I would have made this a return trip.

### Aer Lingus customer review
Honeymoon's are supposed to end nicely! Not with Aer Lingus being 2 hours late to Chicago and missing all flights back to Los Angeles. The ladies who work there are so unhelpful. They made us run to a flight that was taking off in 20 minutes and gave us a voucher to a holiday inn if we don't make it. Of course we didn't make it! We had to go through security all over again! Their phone lines go down at 9.45 ET which means when we call after missing the 8:05 flight to LA they're closed they put us on an infinite loop hold! Flight and airport wait time total was 14 hours! Now we're just stuck in Chicago and wouldn't have been if anyone would have put in any real effort in to get us home like putting us on the 9.25 flight that would have given us plenty of time to get to the terminal from international. Instead of doing what was right they did what was easy. Truly sad and disappointed in the customer service of Aer Lingus.

We travelled from Manchester to New York via Dublin. On the way out the TV's were not working they reset them several times and still didn't work. Food was very poor so advise taking a sandwich with you. Loads of free pretzels for some reason which were horrid. No choice of snack and a very small orange juice break. Coming back we had paid for an upgrade for our seats we were shocked to find ourselves in the middle row of the plane no where near our allocated seats. Complained to air hostess who said they had changed the plane so therefore had been downgraded. No compensation and certainly no refund. Eventually after 2 months complaining we got our upgrade money back no compensation for the stressful flight home though. Also on the way back the movies were constantly interrupted with news of Aer Lingus charity work and asking for money. I had no issues donating the rest of our dollars but would have done so without being asked 10 times.

I've been to Ireland 6 times in the last 10 years and have always flown Aer Lingus. The first time was lovely then United Air got involved and things went completely down-hill. This last trip was horrid. I don't know how anyone could find the seating even close to comfortable. I weigh around 108 lbs and was traveling with my 145 lb brother the seat felt like concrete. Like one of the other reviews I have to sit on the pillow. These retro- fitted planes are the pits. The seat in front of me was 12 inches from my nose (the screen was basically in my face.) The arm rests don't fold all the way back so you have to be a circus contortionist to get out of your seat. Two people cannot pass one another even if they're going sideways. An older gentleman literally fell into what was luckily an empty seat trying to get back to his seat. The flight attendants were pleasant enough except for one male who thought he was "large and in charge". The food was the usual stuff basically it was edible. My brother needs a cane for walking and were with the other handicapped to get on the plane on the return flight. Unfortunately we ended waiting 20 minutes in the cold ramp thing (can't think of the right term) that leads to the plane while cargo was being loaded. That's right cargo not luggage. Yep the people who need canes and walkers were standing around for 20 minutes. As for the entertainment it didn't really matter since I can't look at a screen that's right in my face.

### Aer Lingus customer review
3/4/2014 flight to Dublin. 3 of our group were flying from LAX and one was flying from Denver. Both flights had less than 2 hours layover in Chicago. Since you have to change terminals and go through security again this layover is just unacceptable. The LAX group barely made the flight. It was almost fully boarded when we got to the gate and we did not dilly dally at all. The flight from Denver was 20 minutes late. Our friend and 5 other people ran from Terminal 1 to Terminal 5 and arrived at the gate at 5 minutes before takeoff time. All 6 passengers were denied boarding. They watched the plane pull away from the gate. The exasperating thing is that the Aer Lingus staff at the gate take no responsibility and show no empathy for this issue. It should be noted that we arrived in Dublin 1.5 hours early. So waiting 5 minutes to board those 6 passengers would not have impacted the arrival at all. Then to make it worse on our return flight they canceled my friends upgraded meal. Their logic was "well you weren't on the flight to Dublin for your upgraded meal so we canceled your return meal". I agree with the post about the seat arm rest not going up. Not because you can't spread out but because you cannot get out of your seat to go to the bathroom. Bottom line never again and I would not recommend Aer Lingus to anyone.

### Aer Lingus customer review
Round trip to New York (EI 105/104). Flight out on time and the food was pretty decent I had upgraded my meal choice. Pretty quiet flight not too busy and plenty of space to stretch out although the middle armrest not lifting up all the way is pretty annoying if you're trying to spread out a bit. Fantastic crew. Return flight was fine food not as good and again great crew. However why is this flight scheduled to leave at the time it does (5.30 pm) and then arrive into Dublin 5.5 hours later it's fast but when you land in Ireland it's still only 11 pm in NYC. If the flight is that short and apparently it regularly is then could it not be scheduled it to arrive in Ireland the same day as it leaves NYC. Also I think it was a surprise to ground crew that we got back so early as we had to wait 50 mins for bags to arrive. Aside from that though good round trip.

### Aer Lingus customer review
21/2 9pm EI249 Friday evening Gatwick flight. Usual appalling slow boarding due to passengers having too much hand luggage and no common sense. The seats were smaller than Ryanair and for some unknown reason tilted so it was like we were going to be launched into the sky. The whole flight was extremely uncomfortable and hot. Out of interest can Aer Lingus passengers not count as they seem to have trouble working out where their seats are? Also one case and one piece of hand luggage seem to be interpreted as one case and ninety five bags.

### Aer Lingus customer review
Flew JFK to LHR with family of 5 and overall was very satisfied. Transatlantic flights were not full and the whole family had extra room. Only irritating issues were too many announcements which kept everybody awake and seat armrests which do not come up all the way allowing one to stretch out over empty seats. Dublin to London flights were also good. Although we would have preferred direct flights the savings going through Dublin were substantial and well worth the slight inconvenience plus on the way home one goes through Immigration in Ireland which works very well.

### Aer Lingus customer review
Flew with Aer Lingus round trip Dublin-Gatwick this week. Very pleased with the service overall. The outbound flight on Tuesday was lightly booked and we got away early. Terminal 2 is very pleasant to use and even the security area was moving quickly. This was the first time I had used the pre-order meal service and it worked well in getting the breakfast before the main cabin service began. It is good value and I would estimate that about 10 of the 50 or so passengers had pre-ordered. Coming back was even easier at Gatwick airport and this was an almost full flight. The cabin crew were especially good. I ordered tea and the cheese board (could do with a little more cheese). Weather was bad coming into Dublin in the aftermath of the storms and I could tell we weren't going to be able to land from the approach and just before touchdown we went on a go around. The Captain came on and was very re-assuring and explained what had happened and again the cabin crew were very reassuring in making the extra safety announcements. Nice experience and nice product and great crew.

### Aer Lingus customer review
CWL-DUB and DUB-CWL flight EI3291 29/10/13. Outbound - The flight attendants always had a smile and were very helpful throughout. The only negative thing about the outbound flight was that there was a mother that did nothing but shout at her kids from the moment we took off until the moment we landed and when your flight is at 8.30 in the morning it's the last thing you want. Inbound flight DUB-CWL flight EI3298 31/10/13 - we left Dublin later than scheduled due to the fact there was a technical fault with a light in the cockpit and could not take off until it was solved. Within minutes engineers were onboard and both the captain and flight attendants kept us up to date with what was going on and reassuring us that everything was going well. The flight attendants on the inbound flight were much friendlier and talkative which is a great thing to have on an airline. Even though our flight departed late we landed just 5 minutes later than scheduled. I have recommended this airline to family and friends and actually me and a friend have booked to go back to Ireland with Aer Lingus on the new BRS-SNN route in April! Looking forward to it!

CPH-DUB flight delayed for 3 hrs. Check-in agents said it was due to bad weather in Dublin crew said due to maintenance problems. I understand they wanted to do quick turnaround but the plane was filthy full of rubbish on the floor seatbelts not folded seat pockets not emptied etc. Inflight magazine was glued with chewing gums so it was impossible to read it. Crew announced they don't have any hot meals and sandwiches left from previous sector so only snacks and drinks were available to purchase. Crew did their job but nothing more. Sad low cost- like flight even though it cost 280 Euro.

Dublin to Cardiff on Friday 27 Dec. Stormy day but no information as to when flight would depart. Left waiting in very cold room in bowels of the airport for 2 hours. Flight took off just over 2 hours late but disappointingly pilot never told us they had not taken our baggage due to weight restrictions. At Cardiff everybody stood around the baggage carousel and no bags. Rang Dublin to find out when bags would arrive and found no info. Told case was still in Dublin and as we were due home on Sunday 29th December to go to the baggage counter in arrivals. On Sunday at 1pm I got a call from Cardiff Airport to say my case had arrived and as we were flying home that evening they would hold it at the airport. Like previous comments I like to support The Irish Airline but my confidence in them has been shattered and a good weekend was destroyed.

EI 178 Dublin-London. Thoroughly agree with previous reviewer. Lack of information was very frustrating and unhelpful. Despite the delay luggage also did not make it out of Dublin so it is missing somewhere in the world now. Missed transfer to Sydney and no provisions were put in place for those who missed their flights. As an Irish person living abroad who wants to be proud of their national airline I was very disappointed with the experience I had.

EI 178 Dublin - London 27/12. Original flight cancelled. No staff at gate to provide explanation. Eventually rebooked on EI.178 which was delayed a number of times and departure gate changed on each (4) occasion. When this raised with staff response was rudeness. Flight eventually left 4.5 hours late (missed London train connection and had to book into Heathrow hotel). No food vouchers provided despite wait. On board aircraft no sandwiches available despite 4.5 hour wait in terminal. Had to pay £13.50 for tea ham and cheese 'toastie' and separate cheese/biscuits. Most of 'toastie' overcooked/inedible separate cheese and biscuits soggy unpleasant and also inedible. Use by 'date on toast is wrapper 5 days past expiry. Complained: £10 refunded. Raised matter with purser before leaving aircraft. Argumentative patronising and risible response. One of the worst overall travel experiences I have had - and will never fly this airline again.

### Aer Lingus customer review
Bad weather at Dublin airport. Flights understandably delayed. Aer Lingus and DAA give no information for hours. Then load us on the plane with no information. Then pilot advises we have no baggage loaded and no catering loaded and has no idea when it will be loaded. So welcome aboard sit here for hours with no food and no departure time. We know the weather is bad why not have the courage and customer service gumption to communicate with customers and explain what is happening.

Madrid - Dublin EI 595 22/12/13. Check/baggage drop in Madrid (sub contractor) slow inefficient. Aircraft clean comfortable. Punctuality slight delay on departure arrival on time. Flight attendants efficient friendly and very professional. Greatly improved offerings of food on board at reasonable prices. Baggage delivered speedily on arrival in Dublin. Altogether excellent flight and service. They do however need to watch that they are not let down by ground handling agents.

GVA-DUB A330. Consistency is something Aer Lingus need to figure out. After a recent flight it has me irked. Outbound my designer coat had to be bunched into a ball by a very abrupt FA and put up top for take off due to it not being secure. Inbound my neighbour had 3 shopping bags and a coat on the middle seat and not an eyelid batted? Food service is also always hit a miss outbound I was able to buy a breakfast offering on return nothing was available. Also I note the seat belt sign seems to stay on unusually longer than any other airline probably to keep passengers seated longer in order for service prep. Seats are comfortable for short haul leather but starting to wear slightly. Gold Circle club is a waste of time. At Dublin I attempted to check in at a computer terminal with my passport and told to report to a physical desk for check in. Oh joy huge queues luckily I tried another machine and it worked fine. The only reason I find a lot of people use IE is the route monopoly. I try fly with connections to Dublin when I can but something I have to subject myself to the unfriendly FA's and chaotic boarding and late arrivals.

We have become regular business class passengers on Aer Lingus & they never fail to impress. This time we flew from Dublin to Orlando on EI 121 and returned from New York on EI 104. On both flights the service was quite outstanding. The crew are friendly but professional and the food and wine selections were of high end restaurant quality. Given our experience with other carriers business class usually at much higher fares the Aer Lingus product has to be one of the best available. We only wish they would once again provide a premium offering on European routes.

### Aer Lingus customer review
11/11/2013 my companion and I flew from San Antonio to Chicago and there caught Aer Lingus Flight EI124. The Aircraft was an Airbus 330. The Senior Crew Flight attendant was a very compassionate woman who attended to us and all of those around us with interest and tenacity. The seats we paid $50 extra were extra leg room (perfect) the seat itself for me (I have a 44" waist was tight but tolerable). The food was very good (Lasagne) and the later sandwich (ham and cheese) was also very good and unexpected. Great flight. The return trip on 11/18/2013 Flight EI125 we thought OK now we'll see how it is in comparison. The Male Flight Attendant and also Senior Crew member was great as well. We had the same seats on the opposite side of the cabin. The amenities of even economy class on this Airline are excellent and a great value. The equipment is first class and the crew made me proud to be Irish American.

Went on a holiday to Ireland bag booked through from CPT to DUB then on the return from DUB to CPT the check-in lady said her system does not allow her to book the bag through to CPT. I have travelled this route for 10 years and have never come across such nonsense. As a result our family will never use Aer Lingus again. However it seems that it depends who you end up with when checking in a disgruntled employee can make your experience with Aer Lingus a nightmare.

### Aer Lingus customer review
Use regularly on the ORD-DUB route as well as on its European short-haul routes. The transatlantic flights are always pleasant clean aircraft with friendly staff. IFE is adequate with personal seat-back TVs. Only complaints are that the economy seats are pretty hard and uncomfortable - they're actually nicer on the short-haul flights. I usually have to sit on the pillow to be comfortable. Also the departure gate area at ORD is too small for the number of passengers on the flight - numerous passengers end up standing and sitting on the floor in the hallway. Never had any serious issues with flight delays or baggage issues. Aer Lingus is head-and-shoulders above its only competition on the ORD-DUB route (AA) and its the clear choice for transatlantic flights to Ireland.

### Aer Lingus customer review
We booked to fly from Dublin to Gatwick. Aer Lingus was the only airline flying this route on that day so I had booked them as opposed to BA. We had some extra baggage so I went ahead and booked an extra bag ahead of time for 15 Euro. When I got to the airport I was told that although I had booked and paid for an additional bag I was still only allowed the same baggage weight allowance for one person (20kg). I cannot understand why anyone would want to purchase an extra bag without wanting extra weight. I assumed I would be allowed 40kg when I booked the extra bag but I was still only allowed 20kg which would have been the same weight as if I had not booked the extra bag. I am sure that a lot of other passengers fall for this! In all fairness Aer Lingus is a good airline to fly light. They have very competitive prices if you travel light but it can cost you your shirt and pants literally if you are over weight. I almost had to pay 300 Euro in over weight fess. Fortunately the staff at check in allowed me to manipulate the items in my luggage. I carried three coats in my hang on the plane and adjusted items between my luggage and hand luggage.

London Gatwick to Dublin on 15/11/2013 AE 249 - 9pm flight. Friday flight - delayed yet again due to Aer Lingus passengers taking their time to get on and off the plane. People again had too much hand luggage and the ground staff were forced to place some in the hold. Late take off due to passengers being selfish and hogging the overhead bins and generally being thoroughly stupid with regards to the basics such as sitting down quickly and being able to count from 1 to 29. The crew found it frustrating and its credit to them they kept calm during a very unnecessary delay. I'm finding this behaviour very annoying and am going back to Ryanair who at least make the effort to be on time and their passengers don't push and shove like Aer Lingus passengers.

### Aer Lingus customer review
The service and food was adequate considering we got a good deal on round trip flights between SLC and Dublin. Rather it would have been a good deal if Aer Lingus didn't end up charging my $521 for two more tickets to return home. After getting a little lost in Dublin we arrived at the airport with a little over an hour before our departure time. When we tried to check in at the kiosk it said check-in was closed. The attendant directed us to the check-in desk. They told us check-in had closed 15 minutes ago. When I pointed out that there were no lines at security and that an hour would still be plenty of time to get to our flight they still refused to let me check in and sent me to another desk to find another flight. The frustrating thing was I presumably would have been allowed to check in on the kiosk if I had been there 15 minutes earlier but I still could have had to wait in line to check my bags. That was not the case. I was able to walk right up to the desk because the airport was not very busy. When I went to the customer service desk we still had 55 minutes before our departure. Told they could get us to the U.S. that night but we'd have to find our own connections but she was not willing to quote the price of those other options. As it turns out it looks like Aer Lingus sold our seats out from under us. Yes I suppose I should have arrived earlier but I've made long haul flights before with less time to spare. Not a good ending to our honeymoon.

### Aer Lingus customer review
I was rebooked with Aer lingus to Dublin after our BA flight was cancelled due to technical difficulties. We were very impressed with the friendly and professional service offered. The aircraft was spotless fresh and bright. The crew kept us informed of our progress and had issued a very warm welcome on boarding. On the downside we had booked on a full service airline where drinks and a snack were included on Aer Lingus you pay. However the full breakfast I ordered was delicious and well worth the money. I look forward to booking with you in the future.

### Aer Lingus customer review
Best experience I have had flying transatlantic. Flew round trip MCO-DUB 10/22 and returned 10/31. Continuing service to CDG. Very friendly and ever present staff on the transatlantic portion. The seat turned into an almost lay flat bed which provided a sound sleep in both directions. Wines were well chosen and poured frequently. Meals were well presented with a variety of appetizers before and hot breads during dinner. The staff service and the overall cleanliness of the plane convinced me that I had made the right choice for an airline. The connection DUB-CDG was a packed economy flight. For an hour and a half flight it was tolerable. Aer Lingus competes with Ryanair on this route so everything including water is for sale. My choice from now on for transatlantic flights. Clearing customs and immigration in Dublin is a real plus. American customs and immigration are rude and hostile but about what you would expect from them.

### Aer Lingus customer review
JFK-DUB EI108 Nov 1st. Another more or less faultless flight with Aer Lingus across the pond. Young cabin crew who were enthusiastic smiling and charismatic. Very attentive to all passengers on a late night flight from New York to Dublin. Pilots again very informative on routing weather and arrival time which is great. Crew apologetic for delay leaving JFK but flight still arrived 55 mins ahead of schedule. Added bonus was the fact that the crew played some great modern music while taxiing to stand after arrival. One minor criticism was the pace of check- in/bag-drop. Great job all round.

### Aer Lingus customer review
DUB-ORD and return. Both flights on Airbus 330-300. Seating seemed tight in both width and legroom compared with other airlines we have used. We booked their so called Choice seats for which we paid extra but there is no real advantage to this other than you get to board with business class. Aer Lingus offers the facility to pre-order better quality meals and I would definitely recommend doing this. Much better than the normal economy offer and you get free wine. The service on the flight out was exemplary. They had lost my wife's pre-booked meal but rustled her up a business class meal and gave us extra wine to compensate. Film choice is not nearly as good as we have experienced on Far East airlines and very annoyingly they truncated the film service towards the end of the flight to show a video for their pet charity which they had already screened at the start of the flight. Big bonus being able to clear US customs in Dublin so arrive at Chicago as domestic passengers. On the flight back they woke us up three hours after serving dinner for a cheese roll at 3.30am Suggest they abandon this idea and let people sleep a bit longer. Overall it was as good as economy gets on European airlines although not anything like as good as the likes of Singapore and Malaysia. Would fly with them again.

Dublin - New York Oct 26th: Early start for flight to NYC on EI105 "St. Patrick". Booked flight 6mts in advance for a hugely competitive £440 return. Major plus is clearing U.S. Immigration and Customs at T2 and hassle-free seamless arrival at T5 at JFK. Aircraft spotlessly clean new and unworn. Entered fleet in 2010 only. PTV screens were great with excellent documentaries although choice of good movies limited. Staff professional and efficient. Pilot is provided plenty of weather and routing information. Chose the pre-ordered chicken meal which I would highly recommend doing. Head and shoulders above the standard economy meal. Overall an excellent flight and experience. Could in no way fault.

Dublin to Frankfurt. Departed a little late but arrived in time. Comfortable flight (not full). Good and pleasant service from the cabin crew. Decent selection of food and drinks for sale. Overall cannot fault it and the price was very reasonable.

DUB-DUS-DUB. Outbound flight light load had breakfast not bad value and quite tasty. Remote stand in DUS but efficient transfer via bus so no complaints. So return last night full flight (215 people). Departure at 9.20pm. At about 8.30 at gate announcement made asking everyone to go downstairs collect bags and exit for bus transfer to Cologne where our aircraft was! Turns out curfew at Dussledorf means no jet aircraft after 10pm. Inbound flight was delayed which would have prevented a departure prior to 10 resulting in an overnight. All handled pretty well to the point that obviously this was not the first time this happened! Bit of a pain back through security etc in Cologne and people who had bought duty free in Dussledorf had some issues. Ended up arriving in Dublin at 1am about 3 hrs late. Flight itself fine. My only comment is on one attendant. Few German lads in row opposite me having a few drinks. A bit spirited but nothing to bother anyone. In fact the young attendant on board had a few laughs with them chatting about best pubs to go to in Dublin. Then as other attendant passing they were a bit loud and I noticed her giving them a hard stare. I travel a lot and know when people are behaving in a poor manner but not in this case. She had a furious look the whole trip. Ok so like the rest of us on a Friday night not impressed running so late but we were all in the same boat and I thought the passengers were remarkably stoic and took it all on the chin.

### Aer Lingus customer review
EI775 Agadir - Dublin 12th October. Normally full of praise for Aer Lingus there seems to a general problem with inflight catering with Aer Lingus lately. They heavily advertise their new "pre-booked meal service" this is the 2nd time in 5 weeks that the meals were never loaded? Why offer something you can't provide food for purchase seems to always run out crew were ok but hassled not the normal friendly crew. Swissport the ground handlers are a disaster.

We flew Sep 23 New York - Dublin - Rome return Milan - Dublin - New York. New York - Dublin no problems food and entertainment poor. Embarking Dublin to Rome we were treated like small children (we are senior citizens) and were not permitted to take our carry on onto the plane. Terrible manners and we were embarrassed in front of the rest of the passengers. The return flight was uneventful but overall service very poor for an international airline.

### Aer Lingus customer review
Flight 109 Dublin to NYC. Scheduled to leave at 3.30pm still in airport at 6.40 - airline says next announcement is at 7.30. They are quick to charge high fees for overweight baggage but they fail to spend the money to maintain a sufficient number of ready to fly planes. Weather is fine and we are still sitting in the airport. It is now 6.55 and we are still sitting here. It is freezing so we asked for a blanket: they said they would "organize" one and never provided it.

MAN-MCO Business Class Sep 2013. One cannot praise Aer Lingus enough the flights were excellent as were the meals on board. Aircraft's were spotlessly clean and good service from start to finish. The only draw back was that we could not find lounge at MCO as it was United's in another part of airport.

Trip was Aberdeen to Dublin with Aer Lingus. Flight was over booked. So we got bumped off the flight the issue with Aer Lingus is that they really could not be bothered to sort the problem out. We ended up paying for a cab to Edinburgh but why could Aer Lingus not have managed to do that.

### Aer Lingus customer review
Flew Cork-Nice return recently. Outward flight was fine and on time. Food on flight was quite poor and bad value. Aer Lingus seemed to have changed caterers. Return flight was a shambles. All passengers were boarded on time and the pilot announced that all was ready with just some paperwork to complete which would take just a few minutes. Time passed slowly and the minutes mounted up. After about 15 minutes the pilot said that there was a slight problem and he was waiting for an engineer to sort things out. The engineers duly arrived and were to be seen examining so instruments in the cockpit. They left and returned a number of times and the cabin crew did their best to reassure the passengers and were unable to begin catering of any sort because of customs regulations. After about and hour a supervisor went to the cockpit and some more examining of instruments continued. The pilot said at this stage that there was a fuel gauge problem and after about another 15 mins he announced that the problem had been satisfactorily solved. So one and a half hours late we departed.

### Aer Lingus customer review
Travelled from Dublin to Nice in July. I was seated in front of the emergency rows. When the doors closed I asked a flight attendant if I could take a seat in one of the empty emergency seats. There were 3 consecutive seats empty. You would think that I had just stolen the crown jewels! The young flight attendant berated me with sarcasm "you have to pay for them" in her loudest Dublin accent. This is not the first time I've experienced this type of condescending attitude from an Aer Lingus flight attendant. Totally unnecessary. Unfortunately no other airline flys Dublin/Nice.

### Aer Lingus customer review
MAN-SNN SNN-JFK JFK-DUB DUB-MAN. Got a great deal on the ticket price very comfortable A330 planes on the long haul segments with seat-back IFE with a great selection of movies and music very helpful and friendly crew and decent food/drink selection. All sectors were on time and transfers at SNN and DUB were fast and easy. In addition to the excellent all round service there are two major advantages to using Aer Lingus for transatlantic travel: Pre-clearance is available for all USA bound flights out of SNN and I believe selected flights out of DUB hence you arrive as a domestic passenger in the USA and walk straight out of the airport - the pre-clearance facilities in Shannon at least have virtually no queues and you can get through them in a matter of minutes so I suspect that even accounting for the layover time it is as quick as flying directly. Secondly Aer Lingus use T5 at JFK which is a marvellous Terminal loads of space seats eating and drinking options and really fast efficient (and surprisingly friendly) security - I believe that T5 is exception at JFK in this regard. All in all I would very highly recommend Aer Lingus for transatlantic travel to anyone.

Had a wonderful experience flying Aer Lingus from Boston to Dublin and from Dublin to Chicago. Both trips were effortless and the customer service was top notch. Everyone was friendly and helpful. I also flew this airline between Dublin and Paris and had a positive experience as well.

### Aer Lingus customer review
Just completed a LHR to DUB round trip on flexi tickets which is the nearest you can get to Business class on Aer Lingus. Loved the lounges at both ends uncrowded and stylish. Cabin crew were friendly and attentive. Great in flight magazine. The new Terminal 2 at DUB is a delight. But the aircraft's are very cramped the flight out was completely full and I felt very trapped even being on the front row. The lack of proper inflight catering brings the on board service down combined with the cramped seat pitch and no free on board catering creates a no fills feel. Even if you pay and pre order a meal on a flexi ticket you lose it if you change your time. Surely modern IT could cope with re-assigning it.

Dublin - Malaga return. Outbound on 05/09/13 on A330. All aspects of this flight was excellent. Flight on time seats were comfortable and staff excellent. Only gripe was delay in getting baggage in Malaga airport. Return on 17/09/13 on A320. Seats were a bit hard but ok for a 3 hour flight. Staff again friendly and helpful and flight on time. Baggage on carousel on arrival. Aer Lingus is definitely my preferred carrier out of Ireland.

### Aer Lingus customer review
I flew on a flight from Cork to Paris yesterday and to my horror I was scolded by ground staff that my baggage was overweight. I was shocked because I bought a more expensive ticket that allowed me to carry 2 bags. However in the fine print of Aer Lingus it states that whether you carry one or two bags the maximum weight allowable is 20kg. This makes absolutely no sense in having 2 bags of 10kg since the bag itself weights about 2kg to 3 kg so you lose out if you carry 2 bags. Your total weight allowance shrinks from 20kg to 17kg if you carry one bag and if you carry two bags it shrinks from 20kg to 14kg as the 2 bags will weigh 6kg in total. So I paid extra money for absolutely nothing. I thought that when you paid extra money you will be allowed to carry 2 bags of 20kg each (totalling to 40kg). This is the worse thing I found about Aer Lingus. I had to pay EUR75 for 5 kg overweight. Also this flight had no business class and I had taken the highest class available called Economy Class Flexi Fare. Even my Star Alliance Gold Card was not useful.

### Aer Lingus customer review
This was my first time flying Aer Lingus. Flew from Chicago to Dublin Ireland then back from Dublin Ireland to Chicago. The trip there was fabulous! Great customer service great food! The trip home on the other hand was disappointing. I have never experienced such rude customer service. The food was also extremely spicy when I asked if I could buy some snacks since I was starving I was informed that they cannot sell me any. Won't be flying Aer Lingus again.

Recently flew from Boston to Shannon (EI-134) on board a very comforting Airbus A330 wide body. On boarding the aircraft at Boston Logan Airport for our flight we were greeted by a very welcoming flight crew. The aircraft was well maintained and very clean. As soon as we departed Boston beverage service was served. Complimentary soft drinks served but alcohol was not free which is ok. Dinner service began about 1 hour after departing and we were served chicken or beef. The meal service was delicious. Flight crew came around during dinner service with more beverages and water. More food available if we desired. Entertainment was excellent plenty of choices for movies. I have to say Aer Lingus is a wonderful airline with great service.

BHD to LHR. Flight on time flew on a modern A319 cabin crew friendly enough however legroom was practically non existant I literally didn't have room to read a magazine on my lap and actually getting to my (window) seat was tough. Overall pretty average but the lack of reasonable legroom made the flight quite uncomfortable.

Aug 22nd 2013 Flight EI0105 DUB to JFK. I have to say that I am a frequent flyer with Aer Lingus over the years and I have seen a steady deterioration in the customer service of the airline attendants. I feel that re-education in customer service would benefit many employees of Aer Lingus. Quite frankly food was almost thrown at us when served no smiles and no manners! My friend is a gold circle member and did not accept the dinner served he asked for cheese and crackers and was told there was none.

I flew from Manchester to Dublin (MAN-DUB) and Dublin to Manchester (DUB-MAN) with Aer Lingus. I did not experience any problems. The cabin crew and gate staff seemed okay but the onboard food and drink was a little overpriced.

Flew Dublin - Amsterdam. Despite having bought the ticket with KLM's Flying Blue programme number I was forced to pay extra fee for my luggage.

### Aer Lingus customer review
Having flown several times with Aer Lingus decided to upgrade to their Business Class cabin from Manchester to Chicago via Dublin. Flight transfer is very easy to navigate in Dublin and on this flight you actually pre-clear US customs in Dublin which is an added bonus. Business Class cabin extremely spacious on the A330 and you are warmly greeted with a nice amenity kit bottled water and champagne. Business Class dining is superb and well worth the upgrade cost in itself with a good choice of entrees. Service includes hot canapés salad and main cheese and biscuits together with a choice of desserts. You won't go hungry! Cabin crew are attentive and if you require extra refreshments you only have to ask. On return to Dublin you also get continental breakfast. Seats are comfortable and fully adjustable to how you want. There are extra buttons in the arm rest which allows you to individually control different parts of the seat including massage. IFE good although they seemed to have dimmed the brightness of the screen recently so you may need to close the window blind to watch. Overall great experience and have already booked Business Class for my next trip to Boston in October.

Have flown Aer Lingus nearly every year. Every flight I have flown is excellent. My most recent was from Milan Linate to Dublin. Flight was on time and all went smooth with luggage etc. All members of staff were helpful and accommodating. Food was good for aeroplane standard and was reasonably priced for being on a plane. Seats and leg space are excellent for economy class. I am once again flying with Aer Lingus in 2 weeks time to Lisbon from the excellent Dublin airport terminal 2. It is a brand new terminal. A great value airline.

### Aer Lingus customer review
Took a short haul from Glasgow to Dublin and a long-haul from Dublin to Boston. Flights were on time and boarding was well-organized. The seats were comfortable but everything looked tired and not exactly pristine. IFE is nearly impossible to use as the touch-screens wouldn't respond to pressure. The meal was okay (biryani chicken) though the piece of meat was about as big as an eraser. The flight attendants (save for one very nice girl) were sulky and bored and made us all feel like we were cattle. As we left the plane the cabin attendant didn't even look up into our faces when she said goodbye. In a nutshell the price was good but the service was shocking given the generally warm nature of all the Irish folk I know. Most peculiar.

London Heathrow - ORK. Fly regularly on this route - such a great alternative to other low cost airlines. Flight took off from London early and arrived early and same for the return. Cabin crew friendly and attentive throughout the flight. Food for purchase was good value and tasty. I have flown over 20 times with Aer Lingus and never had a bad experience. Assigned seating comfortable seats and great crew - makes flying a breeze.

BHX-DUB day return 15 June 2013. As a fearful flyer trying to overcome it this was a pair of practice flights for me. Flight attendants could not have been more helpful and supportive especially as they are really busy on short flight. A320s were great and though it was a gusty crosswind day for landings never felt anything but safe and supported. One attendant even provided me with some extra reading material in case I needed it to help distract me and even bought me a drink from the trolley! Was not expecting such above and beyond service. Do airlines realise how much of a good impression caring cabin crew give? Will definitely be flying with this airline again!

Four flights Boston to Dublin Dublin to Milan Milan to Dublin and Dublin to Boston. Short leg flights were okay. Just 2 hours although we didn't see much of the crew and surprised that the only refreshment available on board had to be purchased. Long haul legs were another story. Incredibly disorganized "mob boarding" in Boston. Flight crew on outbound leg were quite grumpy and unfriendly. I had pre-ordered a vegetarian special meal with an allergy requirement. They got the allergy but not the veg part and I was presented with a hunk of chicken which the flight attendant said she thought was "Just a bit of tofu. Offered cheese and crackers. Returning I had called to make sure I got a suitable dinner. Well they had one but I heard them give it to the woman behind me. I had to explain to her that she had my food and get it back. On the return flight a flight attendant came with a big bag of blankets tossed the bag into the corner ripped the bag open and said not one word to anyone. No hot drinks available in the first round of service. Dinner trays stayed around far too long. On the return leg the promised "afternoon tea service" was delayed and was basically thrown at us. After we landed there was no attention from the crew. I've been flying internationally for nearly 50 years and have taken a lot of airlines and never seen anything quite like this.

### Aer Lingus customer review
Traveled with Aer lingus in May 2013 from London to Belfast City. Aer Lingus were punctual as I have always found on this route and the staff were pleasant enough. A major complaint is the terrible leg room their Airbus 319's which they received from Iberia. These aircraft are only just bearable for a shorter journey. I also found there to be too many in flight announcements selling food and goods. British Airways is the alternate option on this route and whilst their punctuality is not as good as Aer Lingus - every other feature is.

We flew Boston Logan to Dublin and Shannon to Boston on Aer Lingus. It was our first experience on this airline and we were very pleased. The planes were A330-200s and were clean and in good condition. Very good entertainment choices. Food was standard airline fare. I didn't order the upgraded meal because I didn't think it would be any better but from comments that I've heard next time I probably will next time. Flight attendants were friendly.

On the Dublin to Chicago flight on the Friday returning Tuesday late afternoon. Nothing bad at all outbound on time departure and arrival flight crew were excellent ordered the "Extra " menu for Euro and it was worth every penny.

Couldn't fault them at all - spot on. Well done to Aer Lingus.

April 27 2013 we took an A330 Airbus from Dublin to Orlando direct. The food was the best I have had on an airline. All flight attendants were cheerful and courteous. The only complaint is that at Dublin airport our boarding passes stated that the gate closed at 10.55 am even though our flight did not leave until 12.40 pm. I do not appreciate being given misleading information like that even if the airline is only doing it to get the slackers to show up on time. I say leave them a couple of times when they are late and they will learn to be on time and not cause the rest of us to show up at the gate only to sit for almost two more hours after already spending two hours going through security and customs! Also the seat cushions on the plane are getting too compressed to have a comfortable trip lasting 9 hours. The seat cushions should be replaced with new ones.

### Aer Lingus customer review
No real complaints about the flight or in service facilities. Main complaint is about the badly designed website. I was flying Shannon to Boston and then on to Tampa with JetBlue. AL kept emailing me to complete the "Additional Information Required". However their website kept rejecting my booking reference. Tried to email them (no reply). Tried over 3 days to telephone AL kept getting recorded messages. Spent at least 1 hour trying to get through to a "person". Eventually did to be told my booking reference was rejected as I was flying on to another destination (Tampa). Then she took the additional info and did it for me. Seems this is a routine problem! AL also could not print off Jetblue boarding card Jetblue referred me back to AL.

LHR to Cork return. On time departure from Heathrow and early arrival into Cork. Early Departure from Cork and on stand 20 mins early into Heathrow. Clean cabin each way and efficient (if a bit brusque) cabin crew. Had reasonably priced drinks on the way out only with the bar service prompt and fast. We paid extra for row 1 which was worth every penny. The only downside was oversize bags in the cabin along with perhaps half of the plane breaking the one piece of hand baggage rule leading to no space in the overhead bins. On a par price wise with other competitors on the route (once extras are added in) but overall my preferred choice between London and Cork with good legroom pleasant staff and a reserved seat.

### Aer Lingus customer review
JFK-SNN-JFK. Excellent flights in both directions. Cabin crew very professional and attentive. Found the check-in process at JFK terminal 5 with JetBlue staff to be extremely slow. Check-in at Shannon was excellent and very efficient. Clearing USA customs in Shannon saved a lot of time and aggravation that I have experienced coming in from other European countries.

DUB-BRU-DUB good service and great value for money on this route. A321 almost 15 years old but clean and comfortable with excellent leather seats and adjustable head-rest. Ground service was competent and speedy and cabin crew were friendly professional and well groomed engaging with passengers. There is a newly updated menu with drinks and snacks available to purchase. I was disappointed to see that there is a now a more limited selection than previous versions of the menu but prices are still keen and quality is very good. All in all vastly superior to Ryanair when flying from Ireland to Belgium.

I travelled from Dublin to Boston and Boston to Dublin (23-26 April 2013). I have been positively surprised. Pretty new A330-202 good entertainment good food. The only weak point was the readiness of the staff in Dublin to solve a problem with ESTA Visa. Fortunately I was able to find a helpful person at Aer Lingus at the end.

### Aer Lingus customer review
Dublin - Santiago return. Both flights on time. Excellent service from Irish cabin crew. Food for purchase but reasonably priced and tasty. Only complaint was lack of staff at passport control in Dublin so long queues. Cant understand. Felt sorry for All non EU passport holders. Not Aer Lingus fault but only glitch in otherwise faultless travel experience.

Booked to fly to Dublin from Birmingham on 18th April on the 14.50 flight. This flight was delayed 5 hours we had no information of any kind during this time. It was not until we got on board and the pilot explained what happened this is very bad practice. It would have been very helpful if we had an announcement just to explain why the plane was late and giving an estimated time of departure. As a result I missed my bus connection and my relatives had to come up to the airport to collect me at 8.30pm.

We recently traveled from the US to Ireland. When we called in on seat assignments for the flight over we paid an extra $60 per person for seats that were to have more room (Rows 9-12) so we could sleep better. Turns out that the seats we had on the way home had more leg room and reclined further so that was wasted money. On the way home the entertainment recycled twice so there was a while where you couldn't watch a movie and since we were in the middle of one when it went down had to adjust it to get back to the spot where it crashed.

DUB to NYC return. A330 found it comfortable and in flight services good. I would comment positively on the check in at Dublin handled quickly and with the US pre-clearance it saved massively on the US side landing in a domestic terminal. On return found the Aer Lingus ground staff in JFK friendly and efficient. Overnight flight to Dublin was quite and comfortable.

### Aer Lingus customer review
Economy from Glasgow via Dublin to New York return. Glasgow to Dublin flight arrived on time and all US bound passengers were met at the arriving flight and bussed to the international terminal. For this flight we had US Pre-clearance at Dublin Airport. However waiting time was horrendous. Flight was due to depart at 10.15 and at 10.45 we still hadn't completed this procedure. Aer Lingus held the onward flight for all connecting passengers resulting in a one hour delay leaving Dublin. Airbus 330-300 seating was comfortable enough for the 6 hr flight. The on demand video system offered ample films. The headphones however of poor quality and sound. A pre-dinner drink was served. Soft drinks are free alcoholic drinks have to be paid for. Meal was mediocre and tasteless. The crew did not come around offering drinks. The younger cabin attendants were friendly. Older crew members acted like their job was a chore. Many not able to smile. Because we had pre-cleared US Immigration at Dublin we were therefore classified as a "domestic flight" and landed at Jet Blue's Terminal 5 in JFK. Because of this and the somewhat lower fare these points would be the only reason I would choose to fly Aer Lingus again.

### Aer Lingus customer review
Flew on the Gatwick/Belfast route 4 times in 2 weeks. Saw today they've increased from 3 to 4 flights a day so I presume they're doing well. They are in direct competition now with FlyBe who used to have this route to themselves and competition can only be a good thing IMHO. AE flight times are very similar to BE although we left before them twice even though their departure time was first. I think that reflects the increased pressure Flybe have on their turnaround times. The service is better on AE even though you still have to pay for food and drink the planes are better (A319s) and were immaculate. Only had hand luggage so can't comment on airport check-in. I did mine using their phone app which worked perfectly. The only niggle is their charging to book seats in the first 5 rows I find it a bit money-grasping. Will definitely continue to use them on this route as long as the price and service continue in the same vein.

### Aer Lingus customer review
Flew DUB-LGW-DUB recently and everything went smoothly. Paid extra for front seats Row 3 on way out and row 1 on way back for quick exit and was worth it. Also less hassle and pressure than Ryanair on same route and times. Tickets were only marginally dearer and not enough to make me join the rush for a seat on FR. Flight was on time in both directions even with de-icing procedures. Ground and flight staff were both excellent but sometimes I wish they would enforce the cabin baggage regulations - even a little bit.

### Aer Lingus customer review
Travelled to JFK from LGW via DUB return. Went out coach and came back Business. The equivalent BA flight (coach both ways) would have been an extra £600 for the dates I wanted. The other thing was the convenience of using LGW instead of the awful LHR T5. Had a very early and quiet departure from LGW. Boarding was nearly on time and quite smooth. The food on board was appalling. It seems that if you pre- order meals you get far better quality. Maybe that should be made clear on the booking website. I needed to take some medication towards the end of the flight and asked the crew for a glass of water. It was provided in a very flimsy plastic 'glass'. Return leg in Business was on the evening redeye. Check-in was fine. Lounge was ok. Once the flight was called and I went to gate we still had another 30 mins wait. Business class seats had a huge control panel but no documentation on how to operate them. Trial and error eventually got the seat flat. The food was poor for business class. The white wine and fizz were excellent but the Italian red with the steak was disgusting. Breakfast was poor for business class. I would have expected an attempt at a cooked breakfast. But maybe that's why it was so much cheaper than BA.

### Aer Lingus customer review
DUB-MCO-DUB. Efficient check-in with added bonus of fast track security in Dublin. Good lounge experience particularly in Dublin. Recaro seats very comfortable. Food quality very good and quality wines served. Staff attentive without being intrusive. A very comfortable way to cross the Atlantic.

### Aer Lingus customer review
Flew on the new service from London Gatwick to Belfast City airport and was very impressed with the service. Great price lovely comfortable planes on time and very efficient boarding (probably helped that the plane was only 2/3rd full). Only drawback although not necessarily the airlines fault is the horrible small dingy and dirty departure gate they use at Gatwick South terminal.

### Aer Lingus customer review
Cork to Malaga and satisfied with all aspects of the flight. On time comfortable pleasant crew good food and excellent value for money. I usually fly Ryanair from Shannon - who possess none of the above qualities - except blowing trumpets on arrival. For me to use Aer Lingus to travel to Spain means an extra 60 mile road trip which I am happy to take.

### Aer Lingus customer review
I flew from Venice to Dublin on 24 Feb 2013. There was only one check-in agent for the entire flight. Venice Marco Polo airport is a nightmare to depart from as there are very few security desks and lots of flights. Queue for security was appalling and stretched out of the departure building! I stood in line for almost 2 hours and saw several flights between different groups of passengers from various countries. Small children and elderly people were very upset. As I stood in line my name was called for final boarding. I only just made it to the gate and saw that 3 other passengers were denied boarding. I was bussed out to the flight alone on a transfer bus. Flight was pretty full and departure delayed 45 mins - not the fault of Aer Lingus though. The seats were fine if cramped. Tea and a snack had to be paid for. The crew were very nice and worked hard. I am a QANTAS frequent flyer and opted for the Aer Lingus flight to gain some more points. I booked a Y class seat and yet have not been awarded any points at all by Qantas who blame Aer Lingus who in turn blame Qantas! The fare was not the cheapest as some rivals offered cheaper deals with a stop-over. I would use Aer Lingus again as I like their friendly staff. I feel that the check-in procedure at Venice needs to be examined and Aer Lingus ought to exert some pressure on the airport to improve the squalid experience in the airport.

### Aer Lingus customer review
Recently flew Cork - Lanzarote return. Both flights were on time and the service was excellent. Cabin crew very good particularly on return flight. Cabins were clean and tidy and Aer Lingus seems to have tightened up on the practice of allowing oversize baggage into the cabin. I had booked well in advance so price was quite reasonable. My usual gripe is with Cork Airport arrivals where the air bridges remain redundant and passengers have to brave the elements and 3 flights of stairs to get inside the airport building.

### Aer Lingus customer review
Business class #124 Chicago to Dublin very clean and new-feeling Airbus 330-300 fine staff very thoughtful and professional. The seat is very comfortable Recarro sport-type does not go fully flat but is very nice in all other conformations. Even though Aer Lingus doesn't match up with the fabulous seating/bedding of major liners they exceed the US carriers in other ways. We saved about $1500 versus those carriers and I felt it was a fine bargain. I'd fly them again for sure.

### Aer Lingus customer review
I flew from Berlin Schönefeld (SXF) to Dublin (DUB). The flight lasted only 2 hours. The cabin was ok it was clean. The seat comfort was ok but not excellent. The staff service was excellent. The food was ok and the sky shop had a great selection. The inflight entertainment was ok but a bit boring.

### Aer Lingus customer review
Seat room in economy is tight on the return flight (7 hours 20 mins) our baggage was mistakenly brought to the cargo area instead of baggage claim. We were given no explanation as to why after an hour our bags were still not dispensed. The staff had no idea even where the bags were! After 1 hr 45 mins we were told what happened and that "we at least know where the bags are". Exhausted after now a total of 10 hrs a meal voucher was given out when all we wanted was the be on our way! The whole experience was handled very poorly!

I flew from JFK to Dublin in June. Everything went extremely smoothly from luggage check in to luggage pick up. The personnel on the ground and on board was extremely friendly and efficient. The only drawback of the airline is the food selection and quality.

Birmingham to Cork out 29th return 30th January. Flight took off on time but hit heavy winds on approach aborted landing and circled for approx 40 minutes before diverted to Shannon. Bussed to Cork. Return flight on 30th January very much the same. When approaching Birmingham told that aircraft was outside it landing limits with the weather. Aircraft circled for approx 1 hour over Birmingham tried to land and aborted then diverted to Luton. Again bussed back to Birmingham 4 hrs late. Why do they use this type of aircraft this time of year which is close or outside it operating limits. Surely pilots have accurate weather predictions.

### Aer Lingus customer review
Boston to Dublin onboard an Airbus 330. A very warm welcome from the Irish crew members upon boarding the aircraft. Soon after takeoff we were served beverage service and then our main dinner course of which was up to high standards. The main course consisted of chicken or beef. A very tasty meal. The crew members were all welcoming and served the passengers with full courtesy and friendliness. I have to say the crew always work hard on these flights and are a pleasure to have on board. I definitely will be flying with them in the near future.

Flight was cancelled recently from Shannon to Manchester 25.1.13. However Aer Lingus took the strain they organised overnight stay in a hotel and booked us onto the next flight the next day. Staff were excellent and could have not done more for us in a difficult situation.

Did my usual Christmas route LHR-SNN-LHR. All in all it was a great flight no delays staff were extremely friendly as always check-in was simple and they also offered to check in my carry on luggage free of charge. If Aer Lingus flew from Stansted I'd fly with them anytime I was going home.

Dublin - Lanzarote 20 Dec return 03 Jan. I have travelled a lot with Aer Lingus and it seems they have moved away from the very low cost type of airline back to what they were. Was seated in row 2D adequate space (I'm 6ft 1). Crew very good as always and its nice to see the mature crew menders on board. I do have one gripe - Aer Lingus have a fantastic Deli/Pay Menu its a pity they never have any of the stock this is my 8th time since July with Aer Lingus where the stocks run out by the time the trolley hits row 2. I complained to the senior cabin crew member - she said agreed - that its always happening to them. Would still use them again no problem.

### Aer Lingus customer review
Unexpectedly excellent. Did exactly what was required (LHR-ORK-LHR) affordable smilingly and on time. Can't ask for more than that these days.

Dublin - JFK on Dec 17 2012. The cabin crew were warm and helpful. I hadn't requested a vegetarian meal but the stewardess was nice enough to bring me extra salads and rolls. They came by often with drink service and to collect trash. The movies and shows available were great. I'm a very nervous flyer and as we were preparing to land a stewardess talked me through it and was very comforting.

Flying from a regional airport in Germany to Dublin at Christmas time over the past few years I have usually tended to use Lufthansa usually transiting via Frankfurt. However in 2012 I chose instead to connect via London Gatwick on the outbound and London Heathrow on the inbound UK parts of the journey. Boarding the flight for Dublin at London Gatwick I was struck by the friendly Irish humour when asked by the flight attendant whether the wrapped Christmas present in my open carry-on bag was for her! That set the tone for the flight and indeed the Christmas season! It just shows how much a friendly crew can add or detract from the flight experience. Aer Lingus offered a professional and friendly service throughout with surprisingly comfortable seats. Did not purchase any inflight catering or make any other purchases given the very short duration of the journey. T2 at Dublin was impressive and although there was a mishap with my luggage on arrival the matter was sorted efficiently and to my satisfaction. I will be using Aer Lingus again in a few months time and looking forward to it.

Flew JFK to Dublin on December 26 2012. Check in was fast boarding was smooth and the flight was pleasant to Dublin. Flew back January 6 2013 Dublin to JFK. Check in immigration and customs pre- clearance boarding were all smooth. The only issue and this is most likely not an Aer Lingus issue was the ridiculous walk from the plane to pick up baggage. Perhaps this was due to ongoing construction at the terminal. If not I feel for anyone that has trouble walking.

LHR-SNN return over the New Year period. Two excellent flights both leaving and arriving early. Ok they have 'add-ons' at the time of booking but they are transparent about it and the luggage allowance is generous. In my view they are the best airline to travel on to/from Ireland. Have been travelling with them for over 25 years and they have been consistently good.

### Aer Lingus customer review
Was scheduled to connect at London Heathrow to an Aer Lingus flight to Dublin. American Airlines flight from the US was late and missed connecting flight. Aer Lingus would not honor ticket and required new tickets to be bought. Ticket agent was rude. Approached Aer Lingus office in Dublin who were unhelpful. Return ticket and check in agent in Dublin was rude and testy. A truly rotten experience.

Flew JFK to DUB return in J for the holidays. Check in at JFK is quick and easy and the oasis lounge is comfortable well stocked and quiet. What sets Aer Lingus apart is the friendly crew and to warm genuine Irish welcome on boarding . Although it was a full overnight flight the crew provided excellent service with generous drinks top ups and above average J food. The almost flat bed is reasonably comfortable for the length of flight. I only managed an hours sleep as its a short hop over the pond. Nice continental breakfast towels and proper tea before landing. Bags off first and overall excellent value. Return leg on the 105 on New Years Eve was excellent. Friendly J check in with no wait new T2 lounge quiet and the benefits of pre-flight clearance in Dublin are immeasurable. Again great crew generous drinks good food and warm smiles.

SEN-DUB-SEN: First time travelling with this airline and have to say very impressed. Booking check-in all very straight forward only problem is had to queue along with other passengers at Southend Airport as no separate bag drop for online check in pax. Flight on time and first time in ATR42 aircraft. Very comfortable seating even with bags under seat in front of you. Allocated seating and not being treated like cattle is a big thumbs up from me. With this airline and Southend airport it has bought my faith back in commercial aviation. Would definitely use Air Lingus Regional again.

Once again another delay on the Birmingham - Cork route! I've flown 3 times in the last 12 months and on each occasion I've experience a delay on 2 occasions in excess of 3 hours (flight time is under 1.5 hours!). Today's flight due to leave Birmingham at 17.15 but message board revealed ETD 21.00. I wasn't prepared to wait that long and went home. As usual no explanation for the delay and nobody around to ask!

Flew DUB-JFK-DUB in Business on A330. Both flights were excellent with attentive staff good food and top- ups of drinks whenever you wanted. Staff did not disappear into galleys during either daytime or night time legs. IFE is very good with a good choice of up to date movies. There was a problem with this on the return and they only managed to get the outbound movies shown. The lie-almost-flat seat was very comfortable and enabled me to sleep for a couple of hours. Both legs were on time.

Traveled from Boston to Dublin an 18 December 2012. Flight was very crowded. Lost of crying babies. They didn't turn the lights off all night and it was very uncomfortable. Flight attendants were rude but I guess they were just busy. Difficult to get any service. Miserable trip.

Flew ORK-FAO with them. Great service and flight time even if it is a bit early at 6.40am. Food is excellent and not too expensive. Cabin crew are professional and friendly. Aircraft Airbus A320 was 5 years old and was very clean and tidy. Fare was good 120 euro return cheaper by 30 than Ryanair however they are far superior to fly with and are very lenient with bag weight. Pity they do not fly more services into Shannon like SNN- MUN SNN-BCN and SNN-AMS. these would do very well for business and leisure people.

LHR-Cork in Nov. Checked in online very easily. Flight was quick to board cabin crew were friendly and the seats were comfy.

Once the a/c arrived they were very quick to board us and again the service was brilliant.

Roundtrip MCO-DUB-MCO. November 10-17 2012. A330-200 was clean the seats were comfortable the inflight entertainment system was excellent the food acceptable and the cabin crew attentive. We paid the extra $100US round-trip per person for bulkhead/emergency row seating. It was well worth it. Row 11 A/C has excellent legroom. A draw back is that the entertainment monitor is between the seat and has to fold up as there is no seat in front of you. I would recommend Aer Lingus in the future.

Cardiff to Dublin evening 11th November. ATR72 looked relatively new bright interior due to LED lights. Seating very cramped more than other ATR 72's I have flown bearable for one hour. The first and second rows have facing seats which were occupied by 2 drunk women. They managed to buy a round of drinks from the drinks trolley and continue their celebrations. The landing was smooth and on time we turned off the runway quickly to reach the stand. Whilst waiting to disembark one of women wore the pilot's jacket as her friend took photographs All the action should be captured on the plane's CCTV. Certainly a different form of in flight entertainment!

### Aer Lingus customer review
Cork-Glasgow route (operated by Aer Arann) on 24th Oct - not a pleasant experience. Flight was 2hrs late leaving - explanation given was the plane was late arriving. Departing Glasgow on 29th Oct was again nearly 2 hrs late (no explanation given on this occasion). Every time I have used this route it is delayed and speaking with other passengers I am not alone! The aircraft is always dirty - coffee spills down the seats/walls seem to be a permanent fixture and added to that the dirty magazines and paper wrappings left behind in the seat pockets. If I had a choice I certainly would not recommend this route to anyone.

Alicante to Dublin on 27/10/2012. Although the flight was a little late leaving Alicante due to slow loading of passengers and hand luggage the actual journey was a pleasant experience. I thought all the staff were friendly and courteous. Arriving into Dublin well after midnight all the staff were still smiling and pleasant as passengers disembarked. I will travel again with EI as long as staff continue to smile and look like they care about passengers.

Milan - Dublin - New York and back. All the flights were on time at departures and arrived at destination before scheduled. The crew were professional and friendly and the flights uneventful.

We flew United from Seattle to Chicago so was dreading the long flight to Dublin. Flight attendants were nice and helpful and much to my surprise the food wasn't half bad. Comparatively speaking the seats were comfortable; certainly roomier than those on United. Upon boarding each seat had a pillow in it and there were free movies and TV programs to choose from. Landed in Chicago 45 minutes early.

### Aer Lingus customer review
Stockholm - Dublin slight delay but comfortable plane and the usual friendly staff. Please Aer Lingus enforce the carry on bag limits it was a full flight and nearly every passenger was hauling on a wheely suitcase. Those of us who had checked in luggage were asked to remove coats and duty free purchases from the overhead bins so that these suitcases could be accommodated which is both annoying and unfair!

Dublin - Boston Return. Both flights on time. Great to clear USA immigration in Dublin. Inflight service outbound efficient but staff not as friendly as normal. Inbound staff excellent nothing too much trouble. Inflight entertainment good but on return had to ask for it to be turned on for the whole aircraft. Staff forgot. Then it had to be rebooted. All told took an hour before the IFE was up and running. All flights on time. Seats standard economy seats but comfortable enough. Great to be domestic flight into the USA. Took 15 mins from getting off the aircraft to kerbside.

DUB-LIN and VRN-DUB - The usual Aer Lingus service. On time clean planes friendly FA's. Quite happy that they are enforcing the carry on luggage rule as planes now get off on time. I don't know why people are complaining about having to pay for food. Most EI flights are 2.5 hours or less. Eat before you leave or else bring your own food and stop complaining. I'm very happy with them and will continue to use them. For the fare you pay (if you book well in advance) I have few complaints about the service.

We were stranded in JFK on 31st Oct after our airline (a large American) had cancelled our flight for the second time as a result of the Super storm Sandy. The only flight they could re-schedule us for was on 8th Nov and the only customer service they offered was a card with a telephone number. We approached the Aer Lingus staff in JFK who despite having no obligation to help us said they would see what they could do. In the end they managed to accommodate us on their flights and got my family back to Dublin The Aer Lingus staff on the day showed customer service at its very best.

### Aer Lingus customer review
Heathrow - Dublin - Heathrow same day return originally booked BA but missed flight so changed to EI fairly clean A320 in both directions fairly clean with adequate seat comfort and space. While it was a last minute booking I'm afraid the service offered for the £570 I paid for the return ticket was abysmal! Only a short 1hr flight but nothing in the way of service not even a glass of water without having to pay for it. The saving grace was because I bought a full fare Y ticket I was allowed to use the lounge both at Heathrow and Dublin which where ok.

### Aer Lingus customer review
We flew yesterday from Geneva to Dublin. The plane was two hours late; overhead luggage racks were full when we boarded and there were hefty charges for any food or drink aboard the flight. It also took unnecessarily long to serve passengers because the crew had to collect money and discuss food selections from all passengers who wished to eat or drink. There were no charges (yet) to use the toilets.

Travelled with Aer Lingus Regional (operated by Aer Arann) return from Birmingham to Shannon. Flights early in both directions. flight attendants attentive and friendly. Plane on outward journey was 23 years old! Seats were old and tatty but nonetheless clean and comfortable. Return flight on a modern aircraft which was in immaculate condition. Comfortable leather seats made the journey more endurable and the plane was spotless.

EI 638 to Brussels. Fly Aer Lingus about 2 times a month for both business and pleasure. Unfortunately not much pleasure flying with Aer Lingus and getting worse. At the gate there was a team of 5 identifying bags take off passengers and put in the hold. Despite my bag being within guidelines (I have measured it) it was confiscated. I was first told that it was too big when I challenged this I was told that it was a health safety risk and would not fit in the bin. Strange as the same bag has been on about 20 flights with EI. It was rude and humiliating treatment by the staff but based on many reviews here it is a common theme. When I got to my seat there was plenty of space in the bin. Arrived late into Brussels and then had a 40 minute wait for my hand luggage. People will be more forthcoming with bags if they are given back to passengers as they get off the plane - Air France and US carriers have no problems doing this If someone has a problem maybe it is because they have documents laptops etc which they would prefer not to go into the hold for obvious reasons. At this stage I will use Aer Lingus when I have to but if there is any reasonable alternative then I won't and certainly not for leisure flights. As an aside the cost of the flight was in excess of €500.

AMS-DUB October 9th and back again October 12th. Both times just after 1PM. No delay on first flight half-hour delay on second but reduced to 20 minutes on arrival. Hand luggage was slightly (about 1 inch) too broad but was never measured or weighed and therefore it wasn't a problem. Both flights about three quarters filled - all single travelers myself included got either a window or aisle seat with the middle seat left clear. Friendly staff and clean planes. On short haul flights no television screens with flight information. Available food on plane very limited. Inflight magazine one of the most boring I've read so far. Good value for money I'd use them again but not for a flight with a layover since (small) delays seem to be common.

Budapest to Dublin on a packed flight early September. We were greeted at check in by the advice that wife's bag was 3 kg over and even though we had only one carry on bag well below 7kg no leeway was allowed. Aer Lingus is the only airline we experienced in 15 international flights that has a 20kg (not 23kg) hold baggage limit. To determine whether or not they are value for money I now routinely add $50 (that's what 3kg cost me) to their fares when I compare them. Food was non-existent so it's not easy to rate it.

Flew with them yesterday Alicante to Belfast. I travel that route a lot due to work commitments and have rated theirs the best service in the past (compared to rivals Easyjet and Jet2). However the legroom on the Airbus 319 last night was simply dreadful. Ok I'm 6'3" but have never had such a problem with them before. My knees were jammed into the seat back in front of me and I couldn't get comfortable. 3 hours of that discomfort and I was ready to scream. I checked the website to see how to complain and I have to do it in writing - no email address is provided. How very convenient (for them not a complainant) Add to that the fact that my first two drink choices (none too demanding - a can of Fanta and then a can of Diet Coke ) were sold out and I'm less than impressed. It appears that due to their move from Belfast International to Belfast City airport they're dumping the Alicante route shortly - on the basis of last night's experience I won't miss them.

BOS-DUB-BCN return. A333's between BOS and DUB were clean comfortable and had great entertainment systems. The inflight meal was pretty good for airline food and the service was very good. A320's between DUB and BCN were clean and a little less leg room. They charged for everything including water. When boarding in BCN they weighed our carry on luggage (never had carry ons weighed on any airline ever before including the flight to BCN) one was a bit over so we had to check it at an extra 50 euro.

### Aer Lingus customer review
Flight from DUB-LHR to catch a connecting flight on another airline. Aircraft was clean and comfortable FAs polite and helpful. Flight on time. Only drawback was deplaning at LHR - passengers who were not connecting to another flight exited the aircraft first from the main door onto a jet bridge. Passengers with connecting flights exited last through the rear door down stairs and met a waiting bus. It seemed backwards to make passengers who might have tight connections wait until last to exit. Also since passengers were trying to exit from both the front and rear of the aircraft single-aisle aircraft it was difficult and time consuming for everyone to leave their seat collect their carry on and make their way to the exits. Perhaps this is a restriction coming from the airport rather than Aer Lingus but it seems like something that could be improved.

We flew from Bournemouth to Dublin. At check in we were told that our bags were too big to go on as hand luggage in spite of the fact that they are the same bags we have always used. We were charged £24 each. This was happening to everyone. Two passengers travelling separately both objected as they had travelled from Dublin to Bournemouth only a couple of days earlier with the same bags as hand luggage. It seems if we had made a scene we would not have been charged $8. Also another passenger on the same flight had a case that would fit under his seat and the steward had to remove it and put it at the back of the plane he was not charged for his bag either. On returning from Dublin to Bournemouth we checked in our bags thinking we had no option other than to pay (there are signs around saying pay up or leave your bags behind) and the check in girl said 'you do not need to check these in they are hand luggage.

Third time on a transatlantic flight with Aer Lingus. This time we travelled from Dublin to New York and back from Chicago to Dublin. Both flights on time. Clean and new aircraft good food excellent service and great films onboard!

DUB - LPA Return. All flights on time. Flights comfortable. Cabin crew very friendly and efficient. Aer Lingus is my airline of choice out of Ireland. Shame no IFE on flights to Canaries as flights are 4 hours in duration.

### Aer Lingus customer review
Went to DUB via ORD. Great experience! Helpful Customer Service. We arrived 1.5 hours early to DUB and on- time back to ORD. First Rate Movies and decent food.

### Aer Lingus customer review
Dublin-Malaga Malaga-Dublin. Onboard A330 which was fantastic! Onboard one of Aer Lingus' largest aircraft for a 2 hour flight! Took off on time clean cabin flight attendants and inflight entertainment was fantastic! Would recommend them.

### Aer Lingus customer review
Flew MAN-DUB-BOS-DUB-MAN. Cannot speak too highly of transatlantic sectors. Good time keeping clean cabin for today's airlines reasonable food. IFE was adequate for flight duration. Seat was comfortable enough again for the trip duration. What made Aer Lingus stand out on both transatlantic sectors was the service and efficiency of the cabin crew. My only gripe is the connection in Dublin where all of a sudden from being in a business class environment one has to jostle with other passengers. Perhaps they could look at having a dedicated point such as Swiss do in ZRH. Also the security point staff seemed overwhelmed with the scanner operator having to open bags too. I hasten to suggest that over worked staff can lead to lapses!

### Aer Lingus customer review
Just returned home from Lanzarote to Belfast on Saturday 25th August and was shocked about the level of customer care given. The senior cabin crew member on the flight was only interested in selling and was continually annoying passengers on the PA and being in the cabin selling things. Whilst I appreciate the airline and crew make money from revenue I have never seen such a cheap and nasty service offered and something I've never seen or expected of Aer Lingus. It was the most uncomfortable flight I've been on as the lights were on bright the entire flight home. Other passengers were complaining but the crew were more interested in selling than making it comfortable for passengers. On a positive note the crew out on Saturday 18th were very good and the crew coming home could learn a thing or two from them! Everything else about the trip was smooth but the journey home just completely spoilt it hence the low scores.

### Aer Lingus customer review
Booked a flight from DUB to YYC 8 months in advance. While I was on vacation Aer Lingus emailed me 6 times to notify me that our connection from ORD to YYC was cancelled but they failed to provide any assistance to get us home. I called their customer service line who offered me a similar flight on a different day but were unable to accommodate our schedule. I asked for a refund for the ORD to YYC portion of the flight which they agreed to but the agent was not able to tell me how much that refund would be. I had to rebook ORD to YYC on my own with a different airline. I will never use Aer Lingus again and I don't recommend it to anyone. Very poor customer service.

### Aer Lingus customer review
Our flight was great and the service wonderful. Staff polite and welcoming and the food good. We had first run movies TV shows games. We flew from New York to Ireland to Italy and back. Would recommend this airline 100%.

### Aer Lingus customer review
I've flown Aer Lingus twice a round trip from Helsinki to Dublin and another round trip from Dublin to Bologna. All flights were on time A320 nice and clean with leather seats that have head rests. Flight attendants have always been friendly providing excellent service. Check-in at the airport and getting an assigned seat is particularly nice and makes standing in line for boarding unnecessary. Great value for money and I fly with them on every opportunity.

### Aer Lingus customer review
Flown them on several occasions and every time there seems to be some sort of problem. The most recent - I was flying to Dublin (with Iberia and British Airways) from Central America via Madrid and London. My flight from Madrid to London (on BA) was delayed so I went to Iberia and said I had to get another flight from London. They immediately changed my flight and put me on the earliest flight possible so that I could make my flight free of charge. I arrived in London and made my way as quick as I could to Aer Lingus. I was too late for my bags to go through but there was one more flight. I could change onto that flight for €78. I booked an overpriced €250 round trip from Dublin to London and then missed a flight due to another delayed flight and they wanted to charge me more to take an empty seat on the next flight! The staff member in London was rude with an uncaring attitude. No level of hospitality and kindness. Flight itself was fine - no frills not much better than Ryanair not much worse.

### Aer Lingus customer review
Tuesday 24th July from Manchester - Waterford. Checked in on time for a departure at 13.15 this actually took off at 16.30 for Cork! If somebody had explained that the plane was being diverted to Cork and we were then being bussed back to Waterford we would have made alternative arrangements. When we were given our £3 lunch voucher we were told that our flight was in Cork. No mention that our flight was being diverted to Cork as well. When we arrived at Cork there was nobody to guide us to the baggage it was not labelled we eventually found the bus! At no time were we told what was happening total lack of communication.

### Aer Lingus customer review
BRS-DUB-BOS. We flew from Bristol to Boston connecting in Dublin. The regional flight was on time with quite poor legroom but we arrived early in Dublin. We changed terminal on one of the buses. The 11am flight from Dublin to Boston doesn't clear immigration in Dublin but it was no big deal. Non-alcoholic drinks were complimentary but things you had to pay for were obviously overpriced. The crew were pleasant and the entertainment was fine. Overall the flights were very good.

### Aer Lingus customer review
Travelled to USA - economy class outbound and business class inbound. Service was superb both ways. Staff friendly on both transatlantic flights and on Glasgow - Dublin / Dublin - Glasgow flights. I would have no hesitation in travelling with Aer Lingus again.

### Aer Lingus customer review
Recently traveled for family vacation from JFK-DUB-NAP. Our original flights to Italy experienced minor delays but our return trip from Naples Italy was horrendous. We were delayed multiple times with no explanation. No Aer Lingus employee ever came to the Gate to explain what was going on. We were not offered the opportunity to fly on another airline and by the time we departed we missed our connection in Dublin and were forced to stay overnight in Dublin causing me to miss a critical business meeting. Additionally staff in Dublin "accidentally" booked us on flights (through London Heathrow) with another overnight layover. I did not discover this until we were in out hotel room in Dublin purely by accident because we were not issued tickets just handed a computer printout and told we were on flights to JFK in the morning. That night after discovering the error I found a United flight direct to Newark NJ and asked to be booked on that instead which I was "allowed" to do. This was the first time I encountered someone helpful at Aer Lingus. Now rebooked on a direct flight the next morning to Newark NJ at my request. To compound the experience the flight from Dublin was delayed 2 hours.

### Aer Lingus customer review
We had a terrible experience with how our cancelled flight was handled and the subsequent customer service after the flight on June 22nd out of New York (JFK) to Shannon. After returned to JFK due to problems with the plane's mechanics we were on the tarmac for 3.5 hours and then it took another 3 hours before we arrived at a hotel to spend the night. The next day we returned to the airport and there were only 2 ticket agents to re-ticket almost 400 passengers. We were given vouchers to use on the plane which we could not use once we got on the plane! We missed our reservation in Shannon and Aer Lingus would not refund this amount. The customer service at the New York Office was just an ineffective as the services we received in the airport.

### Aer Lingus customer review
Flew from DUB-BCN. Never a problem on EI clean plane nice crew reasonable (ish) price for snacks and drinks and T2 in Dublin is a breeze. Why they don't try and sort it out and try to become a 4 star airline is beyond me if Virgin Australia can do it and they can't touch EI on some levels then what's stopping them?

### Aer Lingus customer review
Flight from Dublin to Heathrow to get connecting flight with Air New Zealand to LAX. Flight delayed followed by chaotic approach in prioritising passengers meant we missed our connection by 5 minutes. This would have been avoidable if cabin crew had adhered to its policy of getting connecting flight passengers off first via rear door. Instead we were the last to leave as front door took priority. Very disappointing.

### Aer Lingus customer review
Flights LHR-DUB return. Check in at LHR got us an earlier flight aircraft clean and seating very comfortable. Cabin crew on both sectors were very helpful legroom ok for a short haul flight. First experience with Aer Lingus and will use them again. Overall very pleased.

### Aer Lingus customer review
BHX-DUB-ORD. Very professional crew frequent updates from the pilots arrived 50 mins ahead of schedule food was very nice for economy class. Cabin crew very attentive and always checking up to make sure everything is okay and offering more free tea and coffee. Cabin was very clean and bright and quite quiet. IFE had a large range. Pre clearance at Dublin airport was fantastic and meant we were out within 25 mins once we reached Chicago.

### Aer Lingus customer review
We have today flown back from Cork airport on flight EI3701 to Birmingham. There were four of us so I pre-booked seats on Row 3 to ensure that we sat together. Unfortunately the legroom in these seats was much narrower than the rest of the seats. The two male passengers were 6ft 4in and 6ft 2in so you can imagine the uncomfortable journey they had to endure. It would have been preferable not to book seats in advance and take pot luck!

### Aer Lingus customer review
I flew from Shannon to Boston yesterday 7 July and must say that I was both shocked and horrified that three of the female cabin crew including the cabin manager were chewing gum whilst serving food etc. I expect that here by the staff on US carriers but not Aer Lingus. Otherwise the flight was faultless.

### Aer Lingus customer review
Most recently SXF-DUB-SXF return. The economy class product its getting better after dipping for a few years. Most of the A320s now seem to have the more comfortable seats with moveable headrests and a little more legroom than before (29 rows now instead of 30 I think). I'm an occasional flyer on this airline maybe half a dozen times a year mostly Spain-Ireland or Germany-Ireland. The staff are still pleasant if less experienced. It's a significant notch above Ryanair in overall product and service and worth a premium (often there is none). Pricing overall is competitive.

### Aer Lingus customer review
Shocking late service which the airline knew was running late but instead decided to leave everyone at Gatwick staring at the departure board for half an hour with the - please wait sign on. Unloading and loading of passengers was painfully slow (some passengers haven't yet grasped the need to read the ticket and establish what seat they are in). This is the second time this flight has been delayed and the excuses are somewhat similar. It might be an idea to cut the number of flights if they cannot keep the ones to London Gatwick on time. Very Poor prefer Ryanair. The 15/6/2012 Gatwick to Dublin.

### Aer Lingus customer review
LHR-DUB flight was very well done by all accounts quiet and well maintained. The staff seemed very courteous and keen to engage in small-talk with customers. DUB-LHR flight not brilliant more down to bad luck than anything else on this flight it was more the people I was with that caused aggravation behind me shaking my seat back and forth as if it was a play-thing. This wasn't helped by the person in front of me reclining back so there little room. I am not questioning the plane attendants or cleanliness.

### Aer Lingus customer review
Flew to Milan via Dublin from JFK on June 5th. Found check-in staff at JFK to be extremely rude and not helpful. Aircraft was clean and departure was on time. Toilet midway through flight had no toilet paper or paper towels. They did nothing and appeared to have cared less.

### Aer Lingus customer review
BHX-DUB-JFK outbound BOS-DUB-BHX inbound. Outbound: BHX very quiet no queue for check-in all on time A320 clean the seat is fine for such a short flight. At Dublin the transfer was pretty smooth took approx 30 mins to pre-clear US Customs and Immigration. You don't collect and recheck your bag it's checked through and you are shown a picture of it on the belt to confirm it's yours etc. Boarded A330-300 clean tidy good AVO generally a nice plane to be on. Sat in the 2 row mini-cabin at the front quietest flight I've been on. Recaro seat is fairly decent. Food was perfectly edible and the crew were helpful and friendly. Arrived early into JFK bags came within a few mins. Return flight much the same exact plane and seat. 30 mins late boarding but made up most of it - arrived 5 mins late. Transfer was much easier and quicker A330-A320 in 30 mins left ahead of schedule arrived early to BHX and was quickly out of the airport. Overall very happy and I think this will now be my preferred route to the East Coast saves the trek to LHR.

DUB-AMS ORK-AMS DUB-LGW CDG-SXF. I'm a regular user! Staff are always lovely and will go the extra mile to help you if you need it. Planes are clean and on time. I'm taking a longish haul to LA in August and am going via DUB not only because they have excellent fares but I'd pick them over United Delta BA or Air France any time.

### Aer Lingus customer review
My boyfriend and I book a trip to Dublin only to get to the airport and was told the flight was cancelled. The manager said the next flight was the following day at 9.45pm. When passengers started asking to be put on another flight he said there were too many of us he said there was nothing he could do and finally shouted "I am not going to answer anymore questions the flight is cancelled and that is that". We cancelled the flight and booked another airline that same day.

Flew from Dublin to Boston return with a group of 65 teenagers. Check-in was straightforward and both flights pleasant and uneventful. Excellent product with good crew and well maintained cabin. No complaints!

### Aer Lingus customer review
JFK-DUB Nice flight on a new clean airbus. Food was excellent and IFE was fine with recent movies and plenty of music and games. The seat was not that comfortable as it was not a "Lay flat" but had a slight angle. Still managed a few hours sleep. Crew attentive and pleasant throughout.

### Aer Lingus customer review
ORD-DUB-ORD. Great service both during the check-in process and onboard on both flights. Very good IFE and decent food. The fact that you have to pay for alcohol is a bit annoying but it is becoming the standard in the industry. Clearing customs in Dublin is a great plus. Overall a very good experience.

### Aer Lingus customer review
I have not used Aer Lingus for many years because of cost. I recently went from Dublin to New York. Outward journey perfect. Return another matter. I could not book a seat and at JFK I was the very first in line I was handed a boarding card not having been asked if I would like an aisle seat or otherwise. I did ask for the same seat I had on the outward journey if it was available. I was told it was not and handed the boarding card within 10 seconds. The impression I I got was that the lady at the desk did not even look. It will be a while before I use Aer Lingus again.

### Aer Lingus customer review
Recently travelled from Edinburgh to Dublin and the plane was delayed 40 minutes. On our return flight the plane was once again delayed 30 minutes. In March we made the same journey using Ryanair and there were no delays. It is very difficult to contact Aer Lingus as they don't give email contact details.

### Aer Lingus customer review
JFK-DUB-NAP. Seasonal route to Naples. Outstanding product service and price. Beats any US airline. Professional pilots and FA pleasant and clean cabin A330-300 decent pitch IFE. Armrest does not raise all the way. DUB-NAP on clean A320 Sky Deli edible enough price competitive with airport. Return DUB-JFK A330 bulk seat 9D in private cabin behind Business. Cool spot IFE screen folds with armrest. DUB T2 is small and efficient transfer.

### Aer Lingus customer review
GLA-DUB-GLA. Very reasonable flights but we did not check-in any bags. Check-in with iPad was simple and straightforward and we breezed through security in both directions. ATR-72 plane was ideal for this short flight. The propellers are a lot louder than a jet plane but the 2x2 seat layout is much more suitable for most travellers than the usual 3x3 you expect on sort haul flights. The planes were comfortable and well maintained and the service both ways was professional and friendly. Overall a perfectly acceptable for the short route with an excellent frequency to Glasgow. Much better value for money than the competition (Ryanair from PIK which is invariably more expensive and less frequent). My only real complaint is the need to bus passengers out to a very remote stand in Dublin.

### Aer Lingus customer review
LHR-JFK via Dublin. Lounge access at Heathrow and very nice lounge in Dublin - impressive airport. Flight from LHR-DUB was very full and uncomfortable. Flight from DUB was in new and very clean A330 - only 10 passengers in business class. Excellent service and very impressed with the food quality. Seat was comfortable and spacious. All in all a good experience - would not like an overnight flight as the seat was not at all comfortable for sleeping - angled type and impossible to get comfortable in that position - also a bigger pillow than the regular economy version would have been appreciated.

### Aer Lingus customer review
Dublin-Barcelona: 29 teenagers and three teachers. Ground staff were not very good they seated the group in different rows but they handled hand luggage in an efficient elegant and professional way. No room inside the cabin? No problem they check it in for you at no extra cost. One appreciates such details when dealing with a bunch of students and all their souvenir purchases. As for the flight - peaceful even though I could have used some more leg space.

### Aer Lingus customer review
BHX-DUB-JFK return. Short flight BHX-DUB was fine. Clean plane friendly attendants but cramped leg space which is fine for such a short flight. I had prepaid for my seat selection but due to aircraft change DUB-JFK I was moved to back of plane. I complained to attendant at gate in DUB who apologised and offered to put me in a window exit seat as there were no other aisles available. I preferred the aisle and so stayed with it which turned out to be fine. FA's are for the most part very friendly except for a couple on the return who were efficient but not really friendly. The best thing is being able to go through customs for the US in Dublin on the way out. No lines and easy to get through. ATR on the way back from DUB-BHX looked very old and not very well taken care of. Overall I liked Aer Lingus and plan to fly them again next time I go to the States.

### Aer Lingus customer review
DUB-MAD. Airbus A320. Boarded 30 minutes prior to departure and left ahead of schedule. Terminal 2 in Dublin very clean modern and spacious. Cabin crew friendly efficient and professional throughout. Purchased drinks and snacks which were of good quality and sold at reasonable prices. Seats leather and comfortable with acceptable legroom. All in all a good flight. The only negative aspect was Madrid Terminal 1 which is old fashioned and lacked any decent facilities.

### Aer Lingus customer review
ZRH-DUB-ZRH. Tale of two airlines. Web check-in on the way out went well. Full load but crew was helpful arranging hand luggage. Dealt well with some difficult passengers. Crew professional some very friendly. Check-in machines on the return worked well. Passengers seated in the back where allowed to take big hand luggage with them. Those in the front were not so felt sorry for those who paid even more than for a standard seat as they either had their bags checked in for pick up or had to store it at the back of the plane. Front two crew members absolutely unmotivated and yelling at passengers. Prices no longer that cheap. Terminal 2 is ok. Flight to Dublin would be a 8. Back would be a 3. Buy onboard choice is good and prices are ok.

### Aer Lingus customer review
For the 4th time in 4 weeks I have been delayed on the Edinburgh - Shannon route which is operated by Aer Arann. In all cases this was blamed on technical difficulties with the aircraft - ageing ATR72 turbo props. Today I had a 3hr delay out of Shannon and the Manchester flight was delayed 6 hrs. Very little information and the Aer Lingus information desk was unstaffed most of the time.

### Aer Lingus customer review
GVA-DUB and DUB-MCO. GVA-DUB in economy and DUB-MCO (Orlando) in Business. Both flights on time and impressed by the cabin staff. The Dublin to Orlando flight was lovely - very nice food and wine(s). Seat - not a flat bed and was very comfortable for sitting for sleeping it was not and I cannot imagine spending a night in it. Our bags were tagged through from GVA-MCO and when we checked in for DUB-MCO flight only 2 could be located. Counter staff went out of their way to locate and re-tag the "missing" bag. Pre-clearance for the US was speedy and pleasant. All in all we were very impressed - service and price both right!

### Aer Lingus customer review
I fly twice a week LHR-DUB. Generally acceptable but quite average. Services mostly on time and the journeys smooth. The Aer Lingus Dublin lounge is very pleasant and the staff helpful. Many cabin staff have an unpleasant attitude that suggests we should be thanking them for giving us the opportunity to fly with them - we expect to be treated with at least a bit of respect! The loyalty scheme is not great - they will not provide points for basic non-flexible flights.

### Aer Lingus customer review
DUB-TFS-DUB. Great airline to fly with when travelling with children. Flight attendants seem to make even more of an effort with them. Like the look of their new inflight menu and what we bought onboard was tasty. T2 is a pleasure compared to what DUB was previously.

### Aer Lingus customer review
MAD-IAD. Good value for money a step up on the appalling service that we expect from the legacy US carriers but pretty minimal. This is a code share with United and for all intents a United flight in Aer Lingus livery and standard legacy service issues (complimentary and edible meal but you have to pay for alcohol and snack services). A330 was clean and serviceable. Economy had the usual cramped seats. IFE system is good. For the price it is good value.

### Aer Lingus customer review
GLA to ORD via DUB return. The flight to Dublin was with Aer Arann which was fine for the 50 minute flight. Flight to Chicago on A330-300 and we sat in a small three row cabin just behind business class which was excellent. Crew were friendly and professional and the meal was standard economy fare. Only one bar run so if you wanted wine with your meal you had to purchase it. The return flight was only 6.5 hours which was great and the catering was very tasty. Overall a very good product by Aer Lingus.

### Aer Lingus customer review
We are frequent business class travellers this was our first time with Aer Lingus from LHR to MCO via DUB. The whole experience was excellent. Crew were professional but friendly seats comfortable the food delicious and choice of wines good. Given the price we paid - roughly half that of the other airlines we generally use - the service represents great value for money. A shame they don't offer business class on European services but we were still able to use their lounges at LHR and DUB.

### Aer Lingus customer review
Dublin-Budapest return. Very organised and efficient boarding with on-time departure from DUB. Smooth flight and early arrival into BUD. Cabin crew courteous although a little functional. Return flight delayed 40 minutes. Pilot and crew apologetic for delay. Plenty of information given on routing arrival and weather. Cabin crew were friendly and accommodating. Problems with excessive hand-luggage is regular on this flight but this was dealt with at check-in and by onboard crew efficiently.

### Aer Lingus customer review
BRU to DUB. As a regular flyer with Aer Lingus (Gold Circle Prestige) it is with regret that despite improvements in some areas (e.g. improved lounge) Aer Lingus has difficulty differentiating itself with its competitor Ryanair and passengers are not always the highest priority. Despite a stated policy allowing a cabin case and a personal item such as a laptop bag Aer Lingus has not communicated this to ground crew which led to a poor experience. It is not acceptable for a passenger to be castigated for exceeding the luggage limit when in fact this is not the case. It is also standard practice with other airlines that bags taken from passengers due to lack of space can be collected at the door of the plane rather than at the baggage belt - this is crucial when transfers are involved. Another recent trend is that the seat belt sign is left on until service is completed - a benefit for crew and cabin service rather than passenger comfort. Aside from these issues the flight crews have been generally pleasant on recent trips and 7 out of my last ten flights have been on time although thankfully I had built in enough time to make transfer flights.

### Aer Lingus customer review
Use Aer Lingus for European flights about 5 times a year. We have found that over the last year or two their planes are filthy the seats food-trays and seat-pockets are sticky and dirty every time we travel. We have always used Aer Lingus when possible and have found the service pricing and onboard staff to be excellent but the poor cleanliness is really letting them down. I can't understand why they are letting this area slip so badly.

BRU-DUB-BRU. Airbus A320. Both flights on time. New planes with decent seat pitch. Attendants friendly and professional. Lots of information from the cockpit. Good value for money!

### Aer Lingus customer review
Dublin to JFK November 2011. Boarded Airbus A330 on time staff both pleasant and efficient ensuring a quick boarding had seat just behind bulkhead for business class. This area contains 12 or 14 seats and is worth paying extra for - comfortable and entertainment excellent. The flight was nice crew keeping us informed on route and weather etc meals passable at best! However on par with most other carriers from my experience overall a nice flight and felt well looked after.

### Aer Lingus customer review
Several day return flights DUB-LHR and DUB-MAN. Quite expensive in most cases as booked quite late but were either not much more expensive than Ryanair or less when you factor in that you would have to pay for priority boarding with Ryanair whereas can book a seat for free on Aer Lingus. But there's no comparison between the two. Very good experience and T2 at Dublin is a fantastic improvement on T1. AL have just launched a new Sky Cafe menu that looks tempting and very well presented although it is a bit misleading to be presenting the full Irish breakfast on bone china when it actually comes in a silver foil tray! Cabin crew without exception very professional and friendly although when I was standing at the back of the cabin waiting to disembark at Manchester it was a bit sad to hear two of them complaining about their jobs. It's not the same as it used to be. But given the choice I would choose AL over any of their competitors out of Dublin.

### Aer Lingus customer review
BHX-DUB return. I have flown this route with Ryanair and although it is marginally cheaper (£5 or so) Aer Lingus is worth it. Much more comfortable cabin and seats friendly staff and excellent service. Arrived to destination early.

### Aer Lingus customer review
DUB-MCO. Assisted to the whole family in getting seats at the front of economy class. Dublin is a very clean airport to fly through but I went with Aer Lingus before the big move to terminal 2. Terminal 1 is still very nice. During the flight the cabin crew were nice and food was lovely. All together a lovely flight.

### Aer Lingus customer review
DUB-ALC. Flew on an A320 both ways. Very high density and seats tight. Delay of 30 mins both ways. Very friendly staff and actually made you feel that you were important to them as a person not a customer. Food was lovely and landing was extremely smooth as usual.

### Aer Lingus customer review
ORD-Dublin return. Very disappointing experience. On the way to Dublin the flight was nowhere near full but when asked if we could book seats together it was deemed an inconvenience. The flight attendants are not attentive and are inconvenienced if you ask to be served anything other than tea or coffee. The gate personnel on this airline were unwilling to make any accommodations. On the return gate check-in personnel were awful. They were unnecessarily stern and would not bend to make a single accommodation.

### Aer Lingus customer review
Dub to Madrid. Late departure due to passengers trying to take over sized bags onboard. Gate crew did a professional job of trying to take bags from people who should have known better. An almost full flight handled professionally by a competent crew. Nice Hot Irish Breakfast from the Buy on Board menu and regular updates from Captain during the trip. A great mid way service in terms of getting what you pay for with the care from the crew equivalent to that of any full service airline.

### Aer Lingus customer review
DUB-LIN and BLQ-DUB. M Wickham's comments re: Venice are interesting. I had the same experience flying back from Bologna where the captain made reference to problems on the ground. Took an age to get people to the gate and onto the buses to the plane. No reason for it. Just typical Italian laid back attitude. Still made up time on the way back and only ended up 5 mins late. Both flights were fine on time clean aircraft and friendly FA's.

### Aer Lingus customer review
DUB-VCE-DUB. Outward flight punctual but return over 1 hr late departing. The pilot said that the reason for the delay was a 'long story' and that he didn't want to go into blame mode whilst heavily hinting at service agent problems in Venice. Pilots informative during the flights and cabin crew helpful.

### Aer Lingus customer review
DUB-BCN-DUB. Flights on time crew professional and courteous seat pitch good. Dublin departure from Terminal 1 which was a 10 min walk from security at T2 and the flight to DUB left BCN from the far end of the terminal there - so another 10min or so walk.

### Aer Lingus customer review
JFK-DUB-MAN return. Staff were friendly and helpful. Flights on time or early. Food typical airline quality but edible. I ordered vegetarian special which were delivered. A330-300 clean and adequate space and comfortable seat. The movies offered adequate variety. Only downside I was told that I needed to be at MAN 3.5hrs before departure. I called both the airline and the airport and was assured that this was necessary and check-in would be open at this early hour. So I was not thrilled to arrive at the airport to have to wait for 1hr before the desk opened. US Customs clearance and transiting in Dublin was easy but a lot of walking involved. I would highly recommend Aer Lingus. My fare was $500 cheaper than the best competitor on the same dates.

### Aer Lingus customer review
JFK-DUB-LGW return Y Class. Purchased emergency exit seats for transatlantic sectors. Seats comfortable with extra legroom and FA on JFK-DUB supplied additional blankets. Food simple but adequate service charming and caring. Three hour delay at JFK so missed connection to LGW impressed with EI's handling and were rebooked on next flights while in the air new boarding cards with breakfast vouchers awaiting our arrival at DUB.

### Aer Lingus customer review
Glasgow-JFK via Dublin. All flights on time and clearing US customs and border protection in Dublin was an unexpected bonus. The seats and inflight entertainment was above average. However the bar service was only offered once during a 7.5 hour flight. I asked the stewardess if the drinks trolley would be making another appearance or if I could purchase a beer and she told me I could just have tea or coffee.

### Aer Lingus customer review
ORD-DUB-CDG A330 ORD-DUB A320 DUB-CDG. Aircraft clean and bright. Transfer at DUB smooth and easy. FA's ORD-DUB were curt but efficient. Food acceptable but not as good as other European carriers. ORD-DUB we were served a small snack (pretzels) dinner and a croissant sandwich. There is only one beverage plus coffee/tea service on international flights and alcohol must be purchased. DUB-CDG there is no complimentary beverage or meal/snack service (all may be purchased). DUB-ORD also went well - FA's much more attentive and friendly. Beware that Aer Lingus has lower baggage-weight allowance than most carriers - only 23kg for long-haul flights. I ordered vegetarian meals (ON AerLingus.com) but FA's on the first flight said that they had no record of this request. I reminded the gate agent on the last leg of my trip but I was again told that there was no record of my request on the return trip.

Just spent half a day booking a simple flight from Cardiff to Dublin. The on line booking seemed simple until I tried to add and pay the £24 extra for a checked piece of luggage. What a joke and a waste of my time. The call centre operator eventually sorted my problem out but I have been left with a very negative view of 'Cheepo' airlines. The system is misleading since I did not realise there was extra to pay until after the booking was made. All pretty rubbish really. Let's hope the flight is not as poor.

BFS-LHR-BFS A320. Fully boarded 20 mins before departure on return leg so efficient turn around. Crew friendly and pretty decent service on both legs. Both legs busy - 19.20 from LHR full on return leg. Looks like EI are doing well on this route but have still reduced to 3 flights a day for winter.

### Aer Lingus customer review
LHR-BFS-LHR A320 with decent legroom. Friendly crews. For return leg the inbound flight was delayed 15 minutes (Heathrow and weather). However a very quick turnaround and boarding by front and rear steps rather than the usual seat row number system.

### Aer Lingus customer review
GLA-DUB-ORL return. Service was great and I really liked the seats. Food was good and for the price an excellent service. Would use again. A word of caution Dublin airport is very confusing. The US pre-clearance is excellent but you cannot return to the lounge and we didn't appreciate this.

### Aer Lingus customer review
Travel Dublin to London every week. The aircraft's are comfortable the food choice good and the cabin crew professional and friendly. Gold circle lounges are well stocked. The only complaint I would have is if you are on a flight after 18.00 out of Dub there is normally a member of staff mopping the floor something I feel should be saved for after the lounge is closed.

### Aer Lingus customer review
LGW-Malaga return Economy. Booked online so downloaded my boarding pass 24 hours before flight which with only hand luggage made things simple and fast at Gatwick. Plane was A320 clean tidy and staff were friendly and helpful. Onboard food and drinks were quite expensive seats surprisingly wide and comfortable flight took off and landed on time. Return flight was hampered by not being able to download my boarding pass so no fast track  I had to queue at Malaga for over 1 hr and the flight was delayed for 30 mins but because of tailwinds we arrived at Gatwick 10 mins early.

### Aer Lingus customer review
MAN to DUB then onto Boston return in Economy. A330/A320 both on time. Cabin Crew friendly and efficient. Food onboard was ok. Seat back TV's a bonus. The legroom was comfortable for a 6 hr flight.

### Aer Lingus customer review
BOS-DUB and DUB-AMS. Flew A330/A320. Found the flights professional. FA fairly friendly and attended to needs. Had one get me warm milk for my baby whilst another did not return with an ice cup. Meals okay on first flight need to pay for the second. Baggage free for one luggage second flight was part of KLM codeshare and also free. Planes clean and arrived on time. A330 arm rests did not recline fully so difficult to lie flat.

### Aer Lingus customer review
Amsterdam-Dublin and Malaga-London Gatwick. Staff have been professional and polite although I noticed some of the staff do not have English as their first language and could try harder to communicate more efficiently. One all of the flights I took departure was roughly on time and although in the budget category of airline Aer Lingus offers a good alternative to the more expensive carriers. I do not like the policy of charging for bags and found the website rather unfriendly - the latter is my only real concern. The new terminal in Dublin is very welcoming too. As a non-EU citizen the process of gaining UK and Irish tourism visas was hard and the Schengen visa regime is also very complex and appears to be applied in a random manner. Although not the fault of check-in staff more information should be provided to the staff to enable them to more politely deal with non-EU customers when checking in for flights.

### Aer Lingus customer review
Dublin to Barcelona return. Had to get up at 3 in the morning for the 6.40 flight to Barcelona for a cruise. Terminal 2 at Dublin is very spacious and modern but unfortunately we found ourselves taking a long walk over to T1 for our flight. Very nice flight food was lovely - I recommend if you are flying in the morning to get the Irish Fry. Staff were friendly except for one person who was a bit rude but all in all a nice flight which landed 10 mins early. Same story returning but there was a delay at check-in at Barcelona because there was something wrong with the toe for the bags but when walking to security we passed a new modern and deserted check-in area not in use. Other than that 2 nice on time flights.

### Aer Lingus customer review
AMS-ORK in A320s. Both flights were on time and the cabin crew friendly. In this respect they exceeded my expectations. The planes looked relatively new although on the return trip the cleaners seemed to have missed areas. The range of food/drink for purchase is excellent although the alcohol is expensive for what you get. The only real complaint is the horrible departure times they offer on this route.

### Aer Lingus customer review
EDI-DUB-MCO return. All flights on time on all sectors of the journey. Flying Business Class has access to the Aer Lingus lounge in Dublin. Comfortable seating areas with the usual selection of snacks and drinks. Pre-clearance into the USA is an absolute positive if you fly via Dublin as once you arrive in the USA you pick up your bags and you're all set to go. Inflight service was excellent both ways. Attentive cabin crew who seemed genuinely happy to greet you. Pre-flight drinks were followed by hot and cold canapés and a substantial 3 course meal. Cabin crew continually topped up wine and water glasses without request. Seats are great in recline position and my only minor criticism would be that the flat bed is at an angle. Feels like you're about to slip of the seat however this is only a minor complaint in terms of the great service provided. If you compare the price of business class with other airlines flying to Orlando this is a great ticket especially if you book in advance.

### Aer Lingus customer review
Cork to London Heathrow return. Once again a professional and friendly service provided both flights on time good selection of food and drink for sale. There seems to be an improvement in service over recent years offering great value for money and a decent quality of service.

### Aer Lingus customer review
Manchester to JFK via Dublin. Flight from Manchester to Dublin was delayed for 1 hr through no fault of Aer Lingus. They held the plane for us at Dublin and as soon as we arrived we were personally ushered straight through passport control and US customs. I was impressed the flight attendants friendly and helpful the food good and the inflight entertainment was excellent.

### Aer Lingus customer review
DUB-GVA one way. Smooth Terminal 2 less hassle at check-in airport check-in machines instead of printing your own boarding pass etc. It was a nice relaxed flight on time and the queues were fast-moving. It's not quite the level of other carriers but the premium you're paying for is smoothness and calm.

### Aer Lingus customer review
DUB to BOS return in Economy. Both flights on A330 and both left and arrived on schedule. Staff friendly and efficient and the food was ok. Seat back TV's gave plenty of personal entertainment although the touch screen was not very responsive and you could feel the person behind you giving their screen a good hard press. I didn't find the seat particularly comfortable but ok for a short-ish transatlantic flight. Dublin airport was good my only complaint being that we didn't pre-clear customs in Dublin. Boston immigration was as usual a disgrace. We were near the front of the queue and still took more than 30mins to clear.

### Aer Lingus customer review
DUB-ORD in Business Class. Excellent service once again - provided by professional and attentive cabin crew throughout the flight. The onboard dining experience was just perfect. IFE options have been updated in the past twelve months and are very broad. All luggage arrived promptly at ORD and we were out of the terminal within 20 minutes of landing.

### Aer Lingus customer review
Dublin-Boston return. Enjoyed the new seats and IFE on demand. Aircraft clean and in good condition. Outward cabin crew friendly and professional. Food typical economy fare but edible. Return cabin crew friendly but a little rushed due to shortness of flight under 5 hrs. Only gripe is the pricing of alcoholic drinks. Pre-clearance of American immigration and customs in Dublin a major bonus. 15 mins from plane to bus out of Boston airport.

### Aer Lingus customer review
LGW-DUB return. Online booking worked fine and was convenient. I didn't book any bag so got 2 flights for a very fair price at short notice. £10 seat surcharge looked unavoidable and wasn't fairly explained as optional. Printed my boarding pass at home and breezed through the airport. Pre-clearance at the gate was done professionally as well as onboard welcome. Plane was tidy uncomfortable seats with not enough legroom. Service was professional however food and drink offerings looked pricey. It didn't matter as flight time was just 45 mins. Return flight was about the same both flights on time. Good value for money. Seat improvement would be appreciated.

### Aer Lingus customer review
Boston to Shannon recently. The service was excellent flight attendants were warm and pleasant. The food was very good along with the wines. I will continue to fly Aer Lingus.

### Aer Lingus customer review
Chicago to Dublin return in Economy. Orderly boarding in Chicago for a full flight. Friendly and efficient cabin crew who were nicely presented. A lot of babies and small children on this flight but it was nice to see they helped families get settled quickly. Food good quality and lots of water runs during the night. Seatback entertainment very good. Immigration and baggage all fast at Dublin.

### Aer Lingus customer review
The trip did not live up to expectations. On line seat selection is free 30 hrs before travel so opted for this to save time at the airport. Onboard the aircraft staff were surly and struggled to smile. They enforced safety rules and procedures with an iron fist. One business man was immediately reprimanded for standing and stowing his jacket as the main door had been closed. Seat belts were worn and tatty. All announcements from the cabin crew were rushed making them hard to understand. The only advantage I can see is the use of T2 at Dublin airport.

### Aer Lingus customer review
Dublin-Chicago and on to PDX return. I was on my own with a 22 month old I hadn't bought my child a seat so she was supposed to sit in my lap. However flights were half empty so she got her own seat which was great. Planes were generally clean and in good condition - great seat back entertainment (330). Flight attendants were helpful and attentive. One flight was delayed an hour lots of communication provided.

### Aer Lingus customer review
I have had 12 return flights this year to the US Brussels London and Amsterdam. The move to T2 in Dublin has resulted in a great product. Ground staff in Dublin are great giving some recognition to Gold Circle members is welcome. However we have encountered some inconsistencies/lack of professionalism from some crew. I am confident these minor issues can be resolved. Overall the product is improving.

Edinburgh for a flight to Dublin to connect to JFK return. The cabin crew on all flights were very good. Outbound staff were friendly and professional and nothing was a problem. Very informative about New York and places of interest. Excellent service. Return flight also excellent.

### Aer Lingus customer review
Business class with my son service was wonderful. The seat was comfortable and food was very nice. I lost my bracelet down the back of the seat and the stewardess was on her hands and knees looking for it she couldn't reach it and 5 minutes after landing in Dublin a maintenance worker came on board took the seat apart and retrieved my bracelet.

### Aer Lingus customer review
After booking at such a low fare I was a bit worried but my fears were unfounded. We boarded a very well maintained new Boeing 757 in Chicago for our trip to Dublin and Amsterdam. Two good quality hot airline meals individual LCD flat panels on each seat back with free movies shows and navigation displays. When our departure in Chicago was delayed due to a thunderstorm Aer Lingus held our connecting flight in Dublin and an employee personally escorted us at Dublin airport to make sure we made our connection.

### Aer Lingus customer review
Dublin-Berlin return. Found T2 to be a great improvement in Dublin made a great difference. Flights on time and crew on both flights friendly and a genuine interest in passengers. If you are flying Aer Lingus on an early morning flight I recommend you try their full Irish Breakfast. Aircraft clean and comfortable and was given an exit-row on the return which was great.

### Aer Lingus customer review
LHR to Belfast International and they were fine and efficient. Beware of feeling forced to pay for a particular seat on their website though. They give you the impression you have no choice but to pay extra to select a seat. Just wait till online check-in opens and pick the seats you need and save £10s.

### Aer Lingus customer review
Travelled to Faro and returned to Belfast. Staff where great and the flight was on time with very comfortable seating. I travel back and forward to Great Britain on a regular basis and also to Europe and Canada I will try and book Air Lingus when possible.

### Aer Lingus customer review
Dublin to JFK Gatwick Athens Warsaw and Krakow over the past year with Aer Lingus. Good solid service as usual despite some short delays. Aircraft are generally very clean and comfortable. Vast improvement and consistency in the entertainment system on the A330s since I last flew on one. Also had to cancel a couple of flights to Gatwick and the tax element of the fare was credited back within a couple of days. I called British Airways three times a couple of years ago for the same reason and I'm still waiting. Although AL have pitched themselves in a certain position to compete with the dreadful Ryanair their service is much more consistent than other so- called full service carriers who promise the earth but often fall short.

### Aer Lingus customer review
Flew to Boston from Heathrow via Dublin and back. The service was very warm and the food delicious. Nothing was to much trouble for the crew and met all our requirements. The only drawback was the comfort of the seat. In whatever position the seat was in I just couldn't get comfortable. The other good point with flying via Dublin is clearing US Immigration and Customs prior to departure and landing into the US as a domestic passenger.

### Aer Lingus customer review
DUB-JFK-DUB. Efficient check-in. Outbound flight delayed due to large numbers waiting to clear US Immigration/Customs at Dublin. On the flight the menu choice was chicken pasta or beef pasta now that you clear US customs and immigration in Dublin disembarkation at JFK was swift. The return flight left a few mins early and arrived into Dublin 45 mins ahead of time. The food was better than on the outward trip and the crew were friendly good humoured and helpful.

### Aer Lingus customer review
DUB-LGW-DUB. Single class flight. Online check in easy as usual. SMS to remind me of my flight details a helpful new addition. New Terminal 2 a huge improvement on the old Dublin terminal. Security swift on the early morning rush. Gold Circle Lounge a huge improvement on the old one. Good choice of snacks and food. Flight left on time and efficient boarding with alot of connecting passengers from the US. Cabin Crew friendly and efficient. LGW easy exit but need to remember to have boarding pass ready to avoid passport control on fast domestic / ROI exit. Returning that evening long and inefficient on the queues if a lady is being searched on the opposite side of the X- ray why not call through the 8 gents waiting to go through. LGW should be excellent when finished but inefficient security a problem. Delay on flight on return but efficient boarding and flight. Again the crew were excellent. Arrival into Dublin excellent and to my car within 10 mins of getting off of the plane. Will use again.

### Aer Lingus customer review
JFK-Dublin. Business Class. Return leg of previous review. Efficient boarding at JFK for what was a very full flight. Great Cabin crew who did a nice meal service that wasn't too rushed but not too lengthy either giving passengers who to get some sleep the opportunity. Good Cabin Crew presence throughout the night and they certainly kept the galley noise to a minimum which was much appreciated. Slept well for 4 hrs straight and crew served a very tasty breakfast an hour out of Dublin. Priority bags out very quickly for Dublin anyway and customs a breeze. Can't fault Aer Lingus on this flight they seem to be getting the balance just right on the LCC model. Business Class fares very competitive on this route.

### Aer Lingus customer review
Dub-Orlando. What a poor effort by Aer Lingus. Entertainment systems on flights over and back kept breaking down so whole system had to keep getting rebooted. Kids were served one drink the whole flight then tea or coffee 45 mins before landing.

### Aer Lingus customer review
LHR-BFS-LHR. Arrived at check-in and found a queue that stretched all the way back to Zone A (the entire length of the check-in hall). After some time waiting I and another passenger in fear of missing the bag drop cutoff for our flight left our positions and went to in search of somebody from Aer Lingus at the check-in desks. It was then a race for our flight. Narrow claustrophobic corridors and even narrower aerobridges. EI I suppose can't be held totally responsible for the terminal area assigned them by BAA or probably even the number of counters they can open but I think they could have been a little more pro-active in providing a queue host rather than wait to be prompted by waiting pax in the queue. On the return check in at BFS was smooth no queues at -90mins and despite late arrival of the inbound aircraft we left only 5 mins late. On board both flights were unspectacular and the crew polite and efficient. Although I miss the days when EI was a full-service airline and a member of oneworld they have carried off their transition to a LC carrier successfully. Their website and all rules are simple and clear and there is no ambiguity. If you want extras you pay for them and you get them if not you don't. Simple. We wanted transportation from A to B with one bag which we made sure was under 20kg followed their rules and that's what we got. Easy.

### Aer Lingus customer review
DUB-JFK in Business class. Very impressed with all aspects of the flight. New Gold Circle lounge in Dublin's Terminal 2 is a real improvement on the old lounges. Cabin Crew just first class very friendly and efficient and nothing was too much trouble. With US pre-clearance in Dublin I'm surprised more people aren't using Dublin as a hub for transatlantic flights as the new Terminal is a breeze to get through.

### Aer Lingus customer review
DUB-TLS-DUB. Flight out was on time but return delayed by 2 hrs because of technical difficulties on an earlier leg. Both flights were very pleasant and cabin crew friendly and attentive. The problems with recent giant carry-ons seem to have abated but if you are in row 1 you will not have access to the overhead lockers because they are used for flight equipment and crew bags. A bit on the pricey side but all in all a positive experience.

### Aer Lingus customer review
DUB-MAL. Flew to Malaga recently and overall very good service. Plane was an A330 so we had IFE which was good. Plane seemed new and was very clean. The only negative is that they charge €5 for a set of ear phones to use with the IFE. However any normal ones will work so it's fine. I fly Aer Lingus and have always found them safe and reliable.

### Aer Lingus customer review
BRU-DUB-BRU. Flights were full on both ways and since it is a LCC service on European routes completely uneventful. They exaggerate their selling experience onboard which seems like you are in the middle of a snack- bar/shopping mall: the aisle got too busy with attendants moving about with their trollies. A bit annoying when you want to relax. However I do like the Irishness of the experience with the welcoming words in Gaelic and the green/shamrock colours everywhere. It gave me Ireland before landing in Ireland. And the flight attendants were very courteous and worked hard.

### Aer Lingus customer review
Great flights Gatwick-Malaga-Gatwick; no hassle except Aer Lingus check-in has moved from Zone B at LGW but it wasn't reflected on my booking confirmation.

### Aer Lingus customer review
Smiling and professional service punctuality comfortable seats with seat allocation  without paying extra like all low costs! I had left my ipod on the plane was recovered by staff and mailed back to me in less than a week. Thanks a lot Aer lingus.

DUB-FCO MXP-DUB. Switched from Tues-Mon to avoid the stirke which never took place. No charge for the change which was nice. Both flights good usual professionalism from staff. Got back to find they had finally refunded me for a flight I didn't take because of the snow. They were not obliged to but they did which was nice. Certainly preferable to their main competitor!

### Aer Lingus customer review
Aer Lingus regional (operated by Aer Arann) Birmingham to Shannon. Outward flight delayed 2 hours due to technical fault - information was very poor and we were just left waiting. ATR-72 appeared old but still presentable. Flight was smooth until the descent which was extremely bumpy. Shannon to Manchester 0700 scheduled was delayed 40 minutes due to cabin crew being delayed on the previous days flight and by law are entitled to 12 hours rest. Aircraft of high standard soft leather seats top class service overall and apologies from pilot and cabin crew for the delays.

### Aer Lingus customer review
ORD-DUB. Not the best international flight but cabin crew very friendly. We had an elderly passenger become very ill and they tended her with great professionalism and kindness. Planes a bit tired but the overall experience for the price was above average.

### Aer Lingus customer review
I booked and paid for LAX-Shannon round-trip. Arriving at LAX on Friday they had screwed up my booking and made me fly standby. Their next flight wasn't until Monday so if I didn't get on the plane my vacation would be severely disrupted. Their counter person said he would try to help. He then vanished from the counter not to be seen again when I (thankfully) was boarding the plane. No word of apology from him or anyone else at Aer Lingus. Completely unprofessional.

### Aer Lingus customer review
Malaga to Gatwick. Have flown the route a couple of times with Aer Lingus and I think they compare favourably with Easyjet. The plane was clean crew friendly and legroom was greater. One problem though. I had paid for 2 seats but my partner was unable to fly so I had an empty seat next to me. I was asked to give it up so that a father could sit with his young son. This I agreed to do but pointed out to the stewardess that I had in fact paid for the empty seat. No problem" says she "I'll organise a refund for the unused seat". She took all the details but I heard nothing. When I contacted customer service (a feat in itself) to follow up I was offered £5 which after several emails was increased to £27.93 when I had paid over £100. I was told that cabin crew have no authority to offer refunds. Certainly won't be prepared to offer my seat again.

### Aer Lingus customer review
LHR-BFS-LHR - first time I have flown Aer Lingus since they adopted the low cost model. The only difference between then and now is a lack of business class cabin and food and drink is not free. Still a good experience. Relatively new A320s on this route and a price comparable to EasyJet who serve BFS from LTN. Staff friendly seat pitch adequate and food and drink on sale.

### Aer Lingus customer review
Chicago-Dublin-Manchester. New A330 good legroom and decent recline. Friendly check-in staff at Chicago O'Hare and cabin staff decent food. Choice in the entertainment system could have been better. Expected free alcoholic drinks on long haul flights but charged for. Baggage handled well. Dublin airport is good - shopping food space etc and immigration staff very helpful.

### Aer Lingus customer review
NOC-LGW with elderly infirm passenger. Friendly service from Aer Lingus at Knock Airport. They arranged a wheelchair there and then for us (normally have to warn them 48 hours prior) and got us to the plane. After nightmare journeys with Ryanair (never again) to Ireland in the past treating their passengers like animals this was much appreciated.

London Gatwick-Dublin-New York Boston-Dublin-London Gatwick. New A330 on US routes excellent entertainment onboard and good food. Very kind cabin staff. We arrived at Boston airport and our flight to Shannon was delayed for 2 hours so we could not catch the flight from Shannon to London. Aer Lingus staff rebooked our flights from Boston to London via Dublin. The US immigration clearance in Dublin instead of the USA airports were also great.

### Aer Lingus customer review
BOS-SNN return. The outgoing flight was OK. I recently had a knee replacement and paid extra for roomier seats. The first set of seats were against the bulkhead and I found I had less room than if I had been in a regular seat where I could stretch my legs out. I did not get the same seats on the return and sat with my wife and daughter in the middle of the plane. I noticed that there was much more room. The food was good in both directions. Cabin staff were pleasant and attentive.

### Aer Lingus customer review
Have flown return from ORK to ACE ORK to BCN and ORK to LHR in the past two months on A320. Ground service in Cork can be inconsistent. I was impressed by cabin crew and service provided with a smile. Aer Lingus provide a far superior experience than Ryanair.

DUB-AMS. Breezy check-in through new T2 in DUB new plane flight on time and non-eventful.

### Aer Lingus customer review
DUB-ORD-DUB. Regular traveller on this route and have noticed a steep rise in average fares in the past number of months with no enhancement of service offering. A330s used on USA routes excellent; fantastic personal entertainment systems and comfortable seating however cabin crew are still very inconsistent either helpful and polite or arrogant surly and stroppy. There seems to be no middle ground! Meals and snacks are tasty but very basic and small and there is a charge for alcoholic drinks and newspapers onboard which is very petty on a long- haul flight. Aer Lingus is a quality reliable product and a much better option for transatlantic flights than US-based carriers. The new hub at Dublin Terminal 2 is a fantastic building and represents an excellent transfer/connections facility.

### Aer Lingus customer review
DUB-FCO and LIN-DUB. LIN-DUB delayed by inconsiderate passengers bringing huge bags on board as carry on luggage and by ineptitude of LINstaff. Aer Lingus needs to get a grip of this. Delayed half an hour as people could not seat themselves as people tried to cram bags that would not fit into overhead cabins.

### Aer Lingus customer review
DUB-BHX-DUB. Early morning flight to Birmingham using the new T2 fantastic building and a great service from EI ground crew. Outbound crew good but not anywhere near the Aer Lingus standard. Onboard service was standard on UK bound services. Return flight that night a disgrace. Cabin crew varied some friendly some not so friendly. They were however all extremely unprofessional messed about with the announcements joked with each other during the safety demonstration and during the inflight service.

### Aer Lingus customer review

London Gatwick - Malaga return in economy class. Online booking was simple enough with extras available (seat selection extra baggage lounge access etc) at a reasonable cost after the booking was confirmed. My comments below refer to both the outbound and inbound flights unless otherwise mentioned. Check-in was quick and efficient with friendly staff. Oddly though check-in at Malaga opened just one and a half hours before departure despite their website suggesting that you arrive two and a half hours before. Boarding was pain free and organised with special needs passengers quietly loaded first with assigned seating there was no scrum. Cabin was clean and tidy on an A320 with standard seating and adequate leg room. The cabin crew were friendly and attentive and the in-flight service was relaxed and well performed. A good selection of food and drink was served at an unusually reasonable cost. My bacon baguette was so good I asked for another! Arrived early (by fifteen minutes in Malaga and thirty minutes in London) and was off the plane promptly. I can't comment on baggage arrival times as I had hand baggage only.

### Aer Lingus customer review
Gatwick- Knock flight very good. Coming home on 17th December after sitting on the plane for two hours the flight was cancelled due to cabin crew working to long because of the heavy snow and the delays. Aer Lingus were fantastic and put us up for two nights in a wonderful Hotel.

New York to Amsterdam and back with Aer Lingus and had a great experience. Our flight was a little delayed on the way back from Amsterdam and we were afraid we'd miss our connection in Dublin. But Aer Lingus had someone waiting for us and the gate who escorted us through express security and right to the plane. Staff very friendly and helpful.

Flight got cancelled and still waiting refund from this airline (4 weeks waiting without even a short answer). Customer Care-Center hasn't got a telephone number or E-Mail given on their website -small print out was the only thing we got at the airport no alternative flight or anything like that. You better pray that your flight experiences no problems or you're probably as lost as I am.

### Aer Lingus customer review
Arrived Gatwick at 4am for 0640 flight to Malaga on 23 December only to be told my flight had been cancelled. Having been told by Aer Lingus and other airlines there were no more flights to Malaga until 27th I resigned myself to spending Christmas on my own so went home. At home 2hrs later I received a text informing me there is a special flight out at 11am - so went back to Gatwick and checked myself in. However the rest of my family who were due to fly out later that day weren't so lucky and their flight was cancelled completely with no 'special' flight available - so never made it so Spain for Christmas. My first experience flying with Aer Lingus was chaotic and disappointing and will not be using them again!

### Aer Lingus customer review
Woke up at 4 am to a crying 21 yr old study abroad daughter who had a flight cancelled from Rome to Dublin - Aer Lingus desk information personnel did not notify my daughter that they would rebook her trip for the next day - she in turn spent an additional $1100.00 to try to get home. She is currently in a hotel (still in Rome) and was told there would be no other compensation. She'll be flying back Alitalia.

DUB-JFK return A330 economy. On time comfy enough nice 3 course meal movie snack and small breakfast before landing. AVOD really good and nice selection of movies. All cabin crew friendly efficient and helpful. Pre-immigration clearance at Dublin Airport was fast and save a lot of queuing in NY. Take advantage from seat selection before you fly so you can get best seats available.

Gatwick to Malaga return. Was told to be at airport by 3.10am for flight at 6.10am. Gates were not opened until gone 4am by a very surly man. Same thing coming back - told to be at airport 3 hours before flight time but gates were not opened until 1.5 hours before flight. Not impressed. Have not flown Aer Lingus before. I suppose that's what you get for going cheap. Seats were comfortable with plenty of leg room.

### Aer Lingus customer review
Boston-Dublin A330 with 2-4-2 seating. New plane PTV entertainment friendly helpful staff and crew easy check-in on-time departure and arrival. Just one meal. Charge for all alcoholic beverages. Seats were cramped both width and leg room. Difficult to sleep since cabin lights were left on and crew was making frequent announcements throughout flight. Many were commercial announcements regarding tax-free goods. Dublin-Boston same aircraft type. Same pros and cons with one additional con - cost or change fee to re-schedule was €692. No forgiveness or consideration on non-refundable tickets. US passport control is now at the Dublin US flights departure gates. Easy to get through the passport control gates but the reduced space results in major congestion at the departure gates.

ORK-MUC and BCN-ORK Excellent value for money with Aer Lingus. Both flights on-time service friendly and helpful aircraft clean and a good variety of buy onboard options. What I like about Aer Lingus is the fact that the staff aren't constantly trying to sell to you during the flight. It makes the flight a lot more enjoyable and comfortable. Pre-assigned seating also helps to avoid the boarding scrum.

LHR-BFS. First time on Aer Lingus and I'd be happy to book again. Strikes delayed the aircraft's departure by 90 minutes - I was impressed that self service check-in kiosk itself adjusted the boarding time to reflect this two hours beforehand. Onboard the plane was clean comfortable and I'd picked a fair seat online a few hours before. Cabin Crews clearly more established than Ryanair and ovrall I was impressed with their courtesy and handling of the delays though amused by one lady's charming attempts to sell additional items when people ordered drinks and snacks. Ticket price from Heathrow of £35 is superb value.

LGW-ORK return. Good service from cabin crew a little late out of LGW but made up time on route. Good seats and value for money.

BFS-LHR Flight boarded promptly and took off 15 mins early. Smooth flight to LHR crew very good and landed 20 mins early in Heathrow. Usual good service from Aer Lingus however connecting to a BA flight in First to the US and they had no priority luggage tags at Belfast to put onto our bags.

Belfast Intl to Barcelona and Malaga. Good all round service. Flights on time and efficient. The best point for me was the price. These flights were a better price than budget carriers were charging.

JFK-DUB-EDI GLA-DUB-JFK. Business class from JFK with a stopover in Dublin and very pleased with the experience. I felt obligated to submit a review since our experience was so positive. Business class seating was very nice as we had the newer aircraft both ways. Seats are angled lie-flat but compared favorably to LH’s Business seats. Fairly decent selection of movies and TV shows although the audio selections weren’t wonderful. Flight Attendants in both directions were very attentive. The food was surprisingly good. We were on the late flight out of JFK so there was supposed to be a light meal service with full breakfast in the morning. We started with tasty canapés followed by an optional cold chicken plate — optional because some people chose to sleep right away. The only disappointment was breakfast as the eggs were overcooked. Dinner on the way back was very good with smoked salmon to start and good beef as a main. Both business class check-ins were very quick and pleasant. The lounge at JFK was very nice and food was actually very good. The only downside was that it was outside of security so we had to make sure to allow enough time after relaxing in the lounge. The lounge at Dublin was very nice although with limited food. We had to deal with two economy class check-ins and flights DUB-EDI and GLA-DUB and both were painless. The agent at GLA checked our bags all the way through to JFK even though the two legs had been booked separately. One bag did not make it to JFK but it was located and delivered the next day. All in all it was a great deal for good business class service. We would definitely do it again on the same routes although we probably wouldn’t want to be in a full economy class plane going from DUB to Athens or Rome.

BHX-Dublin-Orlando return. Quick check-in at BHX short flight to Dublin. Pleasant airport waiting for connection. Flight to Orlando food quality and quantity very good as was the seat-back inflight entertainment - our 2 children were kept very happy! Return the same food not as good but still acceptable and flights on-time. The cabin crew on all flights were very friendly and helpful. Only downside our cases weren't transferred at Dublin and followed on the next flight and delivered to our home the next day - according to staff at BHX this happens regularly with transfers. Not impressed with airport security at Dublin - wife bought a bottle of water at Orlando departure lounge and a very rude and self-important security woman grabbed it out of her hand and threw it in a bin when we arrived. But then within 10 feet of security you can buy another over-priced bottle - what's that all about? She missed the 2 cups of airline water in our hand luggage though!

LHR-SNN return. Good flights and service. Fairly no-frills but you don't need that much on a short flight. At least you have an assigned seat. Would always use Aer Lingus in preference to Ryanair.
