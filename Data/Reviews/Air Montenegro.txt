### "Onboard it was a real joke"
I was very hesitant to book Air Montenegro because the company only has two aircraft which can cause problems. But it was the only direct flight. I also watched a Youtube video from the same route and it really didnâ€™t impress. The check in at Tivat was messy with no priority line (even though the sign suggested it). No lounge access. No priority boarding. Onboard it was a real joke. The only thing you got was a small bottle of water and some mixed nuts. The flight arrived on time but due to thunderstorms, the baggage took 90 mins to come which of course is not the airline to blame. So the only thing you get is having a seat on the first row and better baggage allowance. Otherwise a pute joke.

### "waiting for the promised compensation"
Our flight MNE 330 to Rome, after being delayed for over four hours, was eventually cancelled on Monday 26 February 2024. We were kept waiting for hours without updates. Once the cancellation announcement was finally made, we were made to wait an additional two hours while a single representative dealt with a glut of passengers, a total wait time of six plus hours. While we were offered tickets for the next flight to Rome - not until the following Friday, that option was not feasible because we had a flight from Rome to Toronto on Thursday, the day before. The representative informed us to write to you for a refund of the tickets plus an additional 250 euros per passenger as compensation to cover the cost of making alternate arrangements. We had to take a cab to Tirana the next day, purchase new tickets, and fly from there to Rome. I submitted all receipt, copies of the tickets, and copies of our unused boarding passes to Air Montenegro (as they are now called). The refund for the unused portion came in a reasonable amount of time, but I am still waiting for the promised compensation for the additional costs, two months later. I have followed up by email several times and heard back from no one.

### "Crew were professional and friendly"
Clean airplane, departed on time. Crew were professional and friendly. Good announcement from the pilot. Offered a cookie and a bottle of water. No in flight magazine

### "unprofessional and uncooperative"
Absolutely unprofessional and uncooperative communication. I have an acoustic guitar that I want to carry from Belgrade to Tivat on a very local, usually uncrowded flight and the answer is nothing less then "sorry, we don't do that". So no solution.
