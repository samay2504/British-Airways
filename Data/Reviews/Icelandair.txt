### "No meal or snack served"
Not Verified |  Terrible service and inconsistent baggage allowance which resulted in an over priced charge on our last leg. No meal or snack served on a 7.5 hour trans Atlantic flight. Rude staff and over priced sub par food.

### Icelandair customer review
Mediocre service and attitude. Overpriced menu and sub par quality. I would not fly with this airline again. The flight attendants are rude, oblivious and unfriendly.

### "split on three different rows"
Everything was OK, except the seat reservation system/policy. My family of four, on the same booking, having declined all offers of paid seat reservations, ended up split on three different rows in the very back of the cabin. This happened despite several adjacent seats were available slightly forward in the economy cabin. Some airline companies are just pushing the need for paid extras too far. Icelandair is one of them.

### "Baggage was handled very poorly"
Not Verified |   Worst airline ever. Baggage was handled very poorly and we lost a stroller, car seat and booster seat. They didn’t provide the compensation and they sent the car seat back with broken parts after 4 days and stroller is still missing. Worst flight ever

### "quick to issue a full compensation"
Good job of Icelandair, Our flight was cancelled day of the flight due to weather issues. We got rebooked to the next day. We had to rebook hotel and had additional stress the day of. But after returning Icelandair was relatively quick to issue a full compensation and reimbursed us for hotel and meal. Thank you.

### “It felt like a scam”
Worst Airline Experience – Avoid Icelandair! I recently flew from Keflavik to Paris with Icelandair, and it was the worst airline experience I’ve ever had. The staff was rude and unprofessional, lacking basic manners when dealing with passengers. I had pre-paid for extra luggage through their website, but at the check-in counter, they still made me pay more. It felt like a scam designed to squeeze more money from customers. Their website is poorly managed, and their service is completely unreliable. I would never recommend Icelandair to anyone. If you want a smooth, hassle-free journey, avoid this airline at all costs!

### "refuse to extend rebooking options"
Not Verified |  Icelandair’s policy on flight changes due to illness is unacceptable. Despite providing documentation of a serious illness, they refuse to extend rebooking options beyond their arbitrary one-year window. This means I am now set to lose over $8,000 in airfare and Icelandair refuses to accommodate. Their customer service was unhelpful and dismissive.

### “Service was quintessentially Icelandair”
Copenhagen to Keflavík in Saga Class on a 737 MAX. Saga Class is Icelandair’s take on Business Class - comfortable, though not quite a true premium offering. The seats are spacious with generous pitch, though they do not recline into a flatbed. That said, for a short three-hour flight, this is hardly a drawback. Service was quintessentially Icelandair - friendly, efficient, and professionally businesslike. Among options connecting Iceland to Europe and the Nordics, Icelandair remains the most comfortable premium choice. Complimentary Wi-Fi was a welcome perk for Saga Class passengers, though connectivity proved inconsistent.

### "flight itself was smooth and pleasant"
Keflavík to Copenhagen. This flight was operated on anew A321neo, showcasing Icelandair’s Saga Class, the airline’s Business Class product. Although the flight was delayed by three hours - an uncommon occurrence given Icelandair’s excellent on-time performance - access to the Saga Lounge at Keflavík ensured the wait was a comfortable one. The flight itself was smooth and pleasant. While the Saga Class seats are not lie-flat, they are well-cushioned and provide ample comfort for the short journey. The onboard service was warm and efficient. Overall, no complaints. Icelandair’s Saga Class delivers the most comfortable option for travel between Iceland and Europe or the Nordics.

### "customer service was horrific"
The customer service for the numerous issues we had was horrific! Our luggage was lost and delayed for over 2 days, and we were told multiple very different stories about where our luggage was and when we would get it - nobody could help us. Our luggage was damaged beyond use - one missing a wheel and the other missing the handle. When trying to get reimbursed for items purchased while our bags were missing - which we were told we could do by the Icelandair agent - the website didn't work and we got the run-around for a week. It was the same when trying to file a claim for the damaged luggage. We were told multiple different stories on what to do to get reimbursed and still no resolution or information and how to resolve after more than a week. We have still not been reimbursed or contacted. Business Class seats/service on the flight itself ok - not great but not horrible.

### "laughing and flirting with each other"
Terrible! We flew business class (1st flight) and economy (2nd flight) with them. Business class was good service although the pillow was crumpled and dirty from what looked like the last person had stepped on it. The economy flight was terrible! It took over two hours just to get a drink of water. The flight attendants stood beside us after giving the guy next to us his ordered meal and 2 alcohol beverages, which does cost (nothing covered but water on an international flight) they stood there laughing and flirting with each other rather than tending to people so long, about 15+ minutes, that he finished everything he ordered before we even got water. Very inconsiderate and rude flight attendants! Also, forget storing bags under the seats as suggested because unless it's a small purse it's not fitting! The poor family in front of us with kids had to use the call button because they completely ignored that family and they waited 20+ minutes before anyone came. The toilets stopped flushing and there was no water in the bathrooms to wash your hands. Don't even get me started on how disorganized they are for boarding! It causes high stress for some as one woman snapped at us to get behind her in line when she was infact in the wrong line and when she was told that we were business class and she needed to move to the economy line she gave us a look of death.

### "did a pretty good job"
Icelandair did a pretty good job. They got me to A to B to C ahead of schedule with my bags and in pleasant enough conditions. So for a fairly basic airline that’s what you get. The downsides were the food and beverages: not included and the fact that you’re starting to attract the wrong kind of pax on this type of flight. So, for example, I was unfortunate enough to be sat in front of a young Russian lady who glugged down vodka shots whenever she could get hold of a cabin crew and kicked me in the back when I dared to recline my seat and, er you know, sleep on a night flight. Shame actually because the two ladies next to me were both really nice people. So I guess it was just rough luck.

### "friendly and professional staff"
Not Verified | Flying Icelandair Saga business class  is a real pleasure. I got access to the Lounge in Toronto, boarding was smooth and the seats, though not flat bed, comfortable for at five hour flight. In flight service started with a glass of sparkling wine. This was followed by a bar service and a a three course meal served on a textile table cloth, textile napkins, proper glases, tablewear and silver. The cured lamb entree and the braised brisket with mashed potatoes, fennel, fried cherry tomatoes in red wine sauce were all excellent as well as the chocolate lava mousse and the wines. Connecting time in Keflavik was enough though a little bit stressful. A rich breakfast was served between Keflavik and Helsinki. I very much appreciated the friendly and professional staff. It always feels safe to have Icelandic pilots in the cockpit!

### "reassigned to middle seats"
On a recent trip with IcelandAir, we paid $50 extra for two aisle seats. IcelandAir reassigned us to middle seats upon just before the flight and refused to refund our $50. We paid $50 to select two aisle seats ($25 each for seats) Aisle seats are important to us because I am a disabled veteran with chronic back issues, I cannot remain seated for that long of a duration without going into immense pain and my back tightening. When we checked in for the flight the evening prior, we were still assigned those seats. However, when we went to the counter in the terminal to show our passports, the IcelandAir agent gave us new boarding passes. At the time we didn't notice that we were both reassigned to middle seats. We were not told of this change when handed the passes, and did not notice the change until we were beyond security. Once we noticed, in the middle of a meal, I immediately called Icelandair Customer Service. We were initially told that because we were close to departure time, only the airport agents could make seat changes. We went to wait at the gate counter for an IcelandAir representative to show. Once an Icelandair representative showed up at the gate, we told them the issue. At first, the representative lied to us and told us our seats were reassigned because "our payment did not go through". Even when we showed him the receipt, he stood fast on this and repeatedly lied about our payment not going through, saying that the seats were reassigned because we did not pay for the upgraded tickets - although this payment was included in the purchase of our tickets and other aisle seat selections. He then told us that we had to call customer service, that he couldn't help us. I again called Customer Service while at the gate counter. The Customer Service representative then told us that yes, we did pay for the seats but they were changed due to "an equipment change" and that only the check-in desk (prior to security) could reassign our seats, as it was too close to the flight time. As this was now about an hour until the flight, we would have missed our flight if we had to go outside of security, take the airport train to the terminal, try to get our seats back, go through security, take the train to the terminal, and run to the gate. Because this was not possible, we continued to ask Icelandair to give us the seats we paid for, or other aisle seats. We were eventually told that one of our assigned seats (27D) was broken and that is why our seats were changed. We were additionally told that it was a full flight and he did not see any aisle seats available at that time. Seat 27C, which we had paid to reserve (in June! ), had already been assigned to a different passenger and the representative said once a seat had been assigned, they could not take it away. Ironic, given that the seat had been paid for and assigned to my wife that morning, yet they had no problem stealing it and giving it to someone else. The broken seat was apparent when we boarded and saw the taped off seat. However, the 27C seat was fully operational, yet that seat we paid for was also reassigned to a middle seat. We filed online for the return of the $50 we paid extra for the seats, since IcelandAir breached the contract and did not deliver the paid for seats. IcelandAir refused to refund our $50! They stated that "since seats in whole back cabin are with same price".

### "refusing to postpone or refund our flight"
My family and I had just arrived a few days before to Amsterdam when a family emergency caused us to purchase return tickets the next day. We purchased 4 economy tickets on Iceland Air for over $6000 as it was last minute. We were told that the flight was 98% full so we were spread throughout the cabin. About an hour later, my husband, a health care professional noticed that my cough, which I thought was from dry airplane air, had turned much worse, and did a covid test. It came out positive, so he immediately contacted Iceland Air to cancel our flights due to Covid. As a health care professional having worked through the Covid pandemic, he knew what danger we would have put the fellow passengers and crew in, so in spite of Iceland Air refusing to postpone or refund our flight, we did not fly. As we all know, IcelandAir is a budget airline. It is terrifying to me to think that an airline would value money more than human lives, but apparently IcelandAir does.

### "outbound flight was a nightmare"
Not Verified |  The inbound flight was OK. But the outbound flight was a nightmare. Last minute cancellation through their partner airline and no assistance at the airport. I had to purchase another ticket with Swiss in order to get home. I submitted a refund for the part of the itinerary which was cancelled and It was rejected as Icelandair claimed there not responsible for the cancellation through another airline even though everything was purchased on Icelandair website. I did not select to fly with another airline. As a matter of fact, I was never reimbursed and more or less told no ask for anything regarding hotels/accomodations or even fares for anything.

### "stonewalled every step of the way"
The airline sold my confirmed tickets to someone else, downgraded our tickets to economy, and delayed my flight by 22 hours. At no time was I offered compensation. When I submitted a claim on their website, I received an email stating that my flight had been “delayed by minutes.” I have been trying to get some form of restitution, but I have been stonewalled every step of the way.

### “Unhelpful and careless staff”
Unhelpful and careless staff. When there were no more places in the overhead luggage bin, they started to withdraw perfectly placed backpacks and handed back to passengers just to make room for another ones that were the same size or only slightly larger. They haven't tried to reorganise or look for another overhead bin close by with space (one passenger drew their attention for empty spaces but the staff didn't seem to care). It was quite clear for me that they don't want to help, just get over the process as easy as it could get without any thought that their action causes unnecessary unpleasant flight experience for some customers (my husband included).

### "no real business class"
This airline has many problems. One is that there is no real business class even though they call it that. The seats hardly recline making their night flights out of the use a nightmare, and seat reservation in business class is not really possible. Sure you can try but each and every time i fly them (because i must) my seat gets moved to the back without notifying me. I worked for them years ago and sort of know how they operate: preferential treatment of locals, especially employees' friends and families. For some reason this airline also performs extremely poorly during delays which they should by now be used to given the frequent bad weather over the atlantic. again, when things get really tough locals get preferential treatment over their foreign "cattle".

### “DO NOT waste money booking Saga Class”
Icelandair is one of the worst airlines I have flown with in their Business Saga Class. I would have received just as good customer service in economy class and probably obtained a cheaper economy seat with another airline. The staff, particularly on the plane are not very sociable or friendly and everything seems to be too much trouble. I had issues with my hand luggage camera equipment leaving London which has never occurred with any other airline. There was very limited space in the overhead lockers in Saga Class due to airline equipment such as yellow life rafts occupying all the space. Staff were manhandling my backpack containing £15,000 of camera equipment and trying to ram other bags against it causing potential damage. When I asked them to stop I was told to get another flight. There was no priority boarding onto the plane at Keflavik Airport with economy passengers getting onto the plane before me. The in flight meal was of poor quality on the return flight compared to the same class of travel on other airlines. As for Keflavik Airport there was no clear indication of where to drop hold luggage at a Saga Class point, only Self Check In showing on the information boards with no staff to ask. The Saga Lounge has no indication of the queuing status at Passport Control and no separate fast track lane for Saga Class customers using the lounge consequently no idea of how long it will take to get to the departure gate. As a point Keflavik Airport is badly organised and laid out. I book and pay extra money to travel business / economy plus class on airlines particularly so I can guarantee careful storage of my valuable camera hand luggage in overhead locker space as well as receive a hassle free and friendly service from the airline staff. DO NOT waste your money booking Iceland Air Saga Class. You can receive better service on other air lines. I would never fly again with Iceland Air.

### "Good product"
Good product -- round trip to KEF for $300. More space in economy than UA or AA has to offer. Attentive and polite cabin crew, better than UA or AA has to offer. On time departures despite flying challenging routes.

### "nothing to complain about"
Copenhagen to Keflavik on Boeing 767 in Saga Class, which is Icelandair's premium cabin. The Saga Class cabin is configured as 2-1-2 and is the least preferable of Icelandair's layout. Nevertheless, for a short flight it is comfortable enough. Flight was on time, service on board efficient. Wi-Fi in Saga Class is complimentary but on this flight it was sporadic. All in all, nothing to complain about.

### "Everything has to paid extra"
Spend a dime more on your initialreservation (for a different airline to cross the pond) and you'll be cheaper off than using Iceland Air. Looking for a reservation to visit the states this was the cheapest option, but in the end it was the most pricey one. Everything has to paid extra; luggage (+94 USD), food on the flight (pricey and not good value! ), even ear buds to use the in-flight entertainment, but most of all; I was travelling with my minor son and had to pay extra 4 times (!) just to be able to sit next to him. I could live with the additional costs for food (just bring your own, you're allowed), earbuds (bring your own mini-jack compatible) and luggage (common these days), but having to pay extra to have a seat next to my son was just too much. I'm never flying this airline again. And 'complementary beverages', don't expect to much of it. Flight from Europe to Iceland; 1 beverage, flight from Iceland to US: 2 beverages. Only non-alcoholic is complementary. Leg space on regular seats are terrible and the in-flight entertainment is mediocre. No games e.g. and the selection of movies and series is not very broad. The good points; flight attendants are nice, Keflavik is an easy airport to navigate and they do fly modern airplanes. But, this airline flies with Boeing 737 MAX which lived up to the expectation. On the flight from KEF to ORD the ceiling came off on touch down. No, never again.

### "absolutely the worst"
I am someone who often flies from the US to Europe and I have tried a variety of airlines, this was absolutely the worst one. Starting off for some reason seats were assign immediately, which is the first time I ever experienced that with an airline going overseas, so this was quite strange. I had to pay for my seat to be changed as well because when you click “change seat” they only give you like 3 middle seats (I am someone with an anxiety issue and much prefer window seats) and the rest you have to pay for. You have to pay for EVERYTHING. Most planes have entertainment systems and typically airlines provide you with cheap earbuds for free, but these I had to pay for and the ones I was given had an issue with one of the earbuds so it was quieter on one ear as soon as I opened it. My flights were 5h25m and 4h something, so we weren't provided a meal. Not only was the food on the plane expensive and the only free thing was soda and water, the flights were so close together I had literally 8 minutes to find my gate after border patrol so I wasnt able to get any food. This is the kicker and the main reason I am taking the time to review this. I had a checkin luggage and when I had picked it up it was COVERED in cough syrup. I had NOT packed any and you can clearly see that it was split all over my luggage and stained the outside, the inside and a lot of items in the luggage, including multiple pieces of clothing that I struggled to get the stains out and gifts that had cardboard packaging which had been damaged. As soon as I collected it a very nice lady at the airport had created a report and gave me the instructions on how to finish it, while she was apologizing about this happening saying “yes this isnt normal for this to happen”. I did it as soon as I made it to the place I am staying in, providing with plenty of pictures of the outside, inside and every individual item that had been soaking in cough syrup and explained what I can in as much detail I can, including a description of the items and prices of everything (it said that reports get thrown out if the item values are below $100 usd). I also had prepared receipts of my clothing to prove the value if I were asked because I had ordered them online and had the email confirmations. They had immediately rejected it for “proper packing” and had gave no further information except a link to terms and conditions, which looking through I couldnt find anything related to my situation. I tried to see if I could reach out to anyone about this and basically the only answer I had gotten was to submit another report. With all these little things and this happening I really recommend against this airline, as they will wave off any damage they have done and expect you to pay so much more for basic things all other airlines would provide. I will provide a couple photos I had sent them The only good thing that happened was the flight attendants. I am someone who has health issues and sometimes I vomit and it isnt something I can control. On my second flight I unfortunately did vomit and the flight attendants were so helpful. They let me stay a little around the area they tend to stay and gave me one of their seats to sit in, while at least one was monitoring me ensuring I was ok and providing me with water and bread. After I felt better and returned to my seat they had consistently checked on me, provided me with more puke bags, water, trash bag, napkins and alcohol wipes throughout the rest

### "like a U.S. budget airline"
Not Verified | Operates like a U.S. budget airline (e.g., Spirit, Frontier, etc.) Similar to others feedback: no free wifi, meals, or even snacks -- despite the fact that this airline flys mostly long Transatlantic flights. Also, insufficient gate staff led to a chaotic boarding process. Carry-on luggage size is very small (22 pounds, small dimensions) so you may be asked to gate-check your luggage and they might lose it. Overall, this airline felt like a U.S. budget airline (e.g., Spirit, Frontier). Despite similar prices to standard international flights (e.g., on AirCanda, Delta, Jet Blue, etc.) the customer service was worse than those other airlines.

### "take away carryon bags"
Flight was delayed both times causing missing connections and lost family tour times. No meal services on board and no time on airport to purchase meals due to delayed flights leading to no food for 11 plus hours. Delayed baggage on return flight; was asked to file claim by icelandair associate but airline rejected claim stating that since I was ‘ returning home’ they saw no significance to any damages caused to me by my missing luggage. They also forcibly take away carryon bags due to no space in aircraft!

### “onboard service was outstanding”
Keflavík (KEF) to Copenhagen (CPH) in Saga Class on a B737 MAX. Icelandair's Business Class - called Saga Class - is the most comfortable mode into and out of Iceland. The seats are not flatbed, but they are wide and recline comfortably. The flight was on time, boarding was well organized, and onboard service was outstanding. Icelandair provides complimentary WiFi for Saga Class passengers.

### "expect to get what i paid for"
Flight FI603. A very last minute email was received from our travel agent that one of our group had been bumped, loaded onto an overcrowded bus and taken “her words” to a lousy hotel. This ruined the dynamics of our group, ruined what had been an amazing trip. We were all excited and planning to come back next year but not now. When i pay for something i expect to get what i paid for and so did my friend. This airline should consider their customers first.. the airline should be thoughtful for how you are disrupting our lives. We have obligations, starting new jobs, appointments, etc. Apologies are just words and don’t make up for disrupting our lives.

### “disappointed with how we were treated”
Not Verified | My family and I flew home from Helsinki to Iceland for a layover and then to Toronto. First time flying with Icelandair and when we reached Toronto we were missing our luggage. We understand that during a layover this can happen but unfortunately it had my 10 month old daughter’s supplies in it such as her baby monitor, her sound machine, and all of her baby essentials. I was reassured by the Icelandair representative that if we went out and purchased new items to replace which was lost (for the time being) that we would be reimbursed the money. When we received our luggage 4 weeks later we were told that because it was eventually delivered that we were stuck with now owning two of everything. I can’t return the items that were purchased and coming from Canada we can’t afford these items. We also returned home with a broken stroller from icelandair that they also promised that would be replaced but they sent me on a wild goose chase to find a stroller repair shop and I had to dig out the receipt from the stroller from a year ago which i obviously didn’t keep. From the lost luggage to lying to us about replacing items to the broken stroller that we can no longer use and have to buy a new one to being rude over the phone we are very disappointed and disgusted with how we were treated with flying with this company. We will never fly with them again and hopefully others can avoid flying with such a horrible company. (I have never written a review about anything but the amount of money they have costed our family it was worth it for me to express to others, especially families flying with children).

### “Not worth even as a low cost”
Not Verified | This is one of the worst airlines that I have booked with. 1. They have the worst cabin luggage size policy. There is no cabin bag that fits the dimensions they use. 2. They do not mention details like No Food offered during flight for Economy (got an email 1 week before the flight about meal purchase options) 3. No headphones provided for screen viewing. 4. Not worth even as a low cost airline. Worst experience to book this flight! BEWARE! Do not book this airline ever!

### "Terrible customer service"
Terrible customer service. Luggage was lost and customer service has done absolutely nothing to help with the situation. There were many precious gifts from family lost in that suitcase, it is such a shame that we are essentially being ignored by the company that does not care or want to solve their own fault.

### “nothing but a frustrating experience”
My baggage was delayed. Icelandair did nothing to find it and update me on the situation, although I called 20 times. The airline has no desk in Munich airport. They are represented by AHS, who they have no contact with. So I, as a business flyer, was given misleading information all the time that my luggage will be delivered to the home address that they collected. Nothing was delivered on the day of the luggage arrival nor next days. Although there was important medication that in the bag that I need, which I reported to the service desk multiple time. In fact after several days waiting and calling both Icelandair and AHS non-stop, I’ve got a rude answer that if I need my luggage I have to go to the Munich airport on my own as they decided not to deliver it. Munich airport is located far from the city, I am a client who paid thousands for the ticket, my luggage was lost and I had to locate it on my own and even after that they kept giving me misleading updates that they take care of the delivery. When I asked if they cover my taxi expenses related to picking up the luggage, they informed me that they have up to 7 days to decide yes or no. This is nothing but a frustrating experience how they treat clients. Especially if you fly business.

### "flown many other airlines that are better"
My wife and I flew out of CDG (Paris) with a 1 day layover in Iceland on our way back to US. Overall Icelandair has irrational polices and staff that cannot provide a logical explanation for their policies, nor do the logical things to make their silly policies work smoothly. After boarding at CDG we were informed they do not allow bags to be stowed under seat in front, that is different than other airlines we flew. They told us instead of stowing our bags under seat we should hold in our laps, which seems to defeat any safety purpose of keeping aisle clear. Please imagine the danger of this policy if there was an actual emergency. Besides that, they were not policing the baggage that people boarded with not stored overhead, and they did not reserve any overhead room for those in emergency rows that according to their policies are not allowed to stow under seat. Also, the flight was uncomfortably warm the entire 3 hours, which was surprising given we left a cool place and landed in a cold place. We accepted the situation for what it was and figured we would just need to try to board as early as possible after our layover. Joke was on us because Icelandair is completely different outside of Iceland “because it is their hub” per customer service person that refused to provide their name for “safety” at check in in Icelandair. Here they were enforcing various different policies that were not mentioned not enforced out of CDG (despite being same airline). They forced us to check a brand new and expensive carry on sized bag (that fits in overhead compartments) and refused to provide any explanation for why that had to be checked here and not on the last Icelandair flight. Overall I would describe Icelandair as a crap show. Some of their policies do not make sense, their agents do not seem interested in helping nor explaining, and this makes me believe there is not a single person in management interested in running their company effectively. We have flown many other airlines that are better. I would say Alaska Airlines makes Icelandair look like a bunch of careless fools.

### "Satisfied with the service"
Satisfied with the service on Icelandair. This was an early morning flight I did in mid April last month, and there was no issues with delays or baggage. Had a small snack on the 2.5hr flight and a coffee, and as I was informed by crew before boarding, all the snacks had to be paid for. Didn't have the option to fly British Airways or any other carrier for this flight on this particular day, but I feel Icelandair were satisfactory enough. Crew were friendly and helpful, and IFE was good considering the short flight time. Would fly with them again, if I get to travel to Reykjavik again someday.

### "flight was on time and comfortable"
Copenhagen to Keflavík in Saga Class. Icelandair provides the best Business Class experience from Europe / Scandinavia to and from Iceland. The flight was on time and comfortable. WiFi is included for Saga Class passengers which is a nice touch.

### "terrible policies regarding delays"
So, so airline with terrible policies regarding delays and cancellations. They delayed our flight 3 hours during boarding and then refused meal vouchers (the original flight was at 5pm) because the delay wasn’t long enough. 3 hours stuck in terminal 1 at the airport isn’t long enough? They also refused to address connecting flight cancellations, hotels, and transportation costs caused by their delay.

### “there was no compassion”
We flew on Iceland Air in December 2023. My travel companions and I were unable to get from Hannover, Germany to Amsterdam to make it to our scheduled December 9th flight to Reykjavik due to a train strike that was announced on the 8th. We attempted multiple times to talk to customer service to change our flight and were told multiple times that "your flight has not been affected". We were unable to change our flight without a change fee of $250.00. This was very upsetting to us as this was totally out of our control. To add insult to injury there was no compassion from the reservation employees. When we did fly on the 13th it was extremely cold and windy. There was no inside gate for the flight we were taking so we were bused out to the tarmac and had to walk up the stairs. With 2 out of 3 being disabled this was very difficult. On a positive note, the flight attendants were very friendly and helpful. I would recommend this airline if you are not disabled and you have travel insurance.

### "service was warm and professional"
Keflavík to Copenhagen in Saga Class. Smooth journey all the way from check-in to Saga Lounge at KEF, to boarding and the actual flight. Saga Class on Icelandair is the most comfortable mode of air transport into and out of Iceland. WiFi and meals are included in this premium class. Onboard service was warm and professional.

### "most austere conditions"
Not Verified | I have been travelling regularly for the last 40 yrs around the world and this is the WORST airline ever! I had the displeasure of flying on IcelandAir on 04 Jan 2024 from Paris to Iceland and from Iceland to Dulles, Washington, USA. I disembarked the aircraft in Iceland under the most austere conditions. It was ONE degree Celsius when we arrived in Iceland and passengers had to walk down the aircraft's stairs and onto the tarmac that was laden with ice to get inside in the terminal - this was dangerous and unsafe especially for handicap passengers. Upon take off on my flight to Dulles, the overhead compartment above me and the passenger next to me started dripping water. I called and the flight attendant came and told me she was accustomed to this occurring and that it would stop in 10 mins. She bought us a blanket that was just refolded from the previous flight and not laundered before giving it to new passengers to use. The pillows on the aircraft were also being reused without a change of cover. I asked her if there was another seat that I could move to, and she said she would check and get back to me – she never returned with an answer. The dripping of water continued for an hour. I also had to pay 88 Euros for my first checked bag. This is an international flight and as such at least the first checked bag should be free like the rest of the airlines. Don't expect anything to eat (not even a snack) on the 6 hour flight from Iceland to the US!

### "ground service poor, crew made up shortcomings"
Unfortunately this review is not as good as the last. We flew from Keflavik to London this morning. Check in / baggage drop was absolute chaos, as well as boarding. My wife tried the automated check in and baggage drop this morning and not all of our boarding passes were valid, which we didn't discover until reaching security, so we had to go back down stairs and join the long line and start again. There were loads of Icelandair ground staff standing around and also making the time to greet each other with hugs and kisses - these staff members would have been more useful on desks rather than standing around. Once this issue was sorted, we went through security. (Here's some advice when going through security at any airport - get your electronics out of your bag and ready to put in the tray, as well as any liquids before you get to the belt where you put your stuff in the trays. Also, be prepared to remove your belt or take your shoes off. This will save you holding others up) I was very disappointed that we were shafted to a dingy downstairs area and be treated like second class passengers and have to use the buses to the aircraft. This involved a long walk up and down stairs and escalators and further checks on our passports and tickets. We got to one point where there was a carousel, no staff members were here and people were pushing and shoving and things were getting dangerous for people coming up the stairs, so I took the initiative to get everyone's attention and politely suggest that we use the carousel for the safety of others (much to the extreme embarrassment of our 2 children) - amazingly everyone complied with my request. Boarding and bus transfer went well from here. On board, the crew looked immaculate and were very professional in their duties. Pilots got us to Heathrow safely and all of our baggage was delivered in a timely manner. The aircraft (rows 6 and 7) seats were comfortable enough. Icelandair have movies which make the trip go quicker, although the Northern Lights didn't make an appearance as we got through the clouds, we were treated to a nice snowstorm as we went through the clouds. To sum things up, ground service was poor, but cabin crew made up for these shortcomings.

### "aircraft was clean and comfortable"
The flight left on time and it was nice to have a check in counter manned by a person. The aircraft was clean and comfortable with movies - you will need to bring headphones or buy a set on board. The crew were very smart looking and professional. Our luggage was on the belt by the time we arrived at the baggage belt, about 20 mins after we left the aircraft. The only thing I was not happy about was that the aircraft was parked at a remote stand and passengers had to be crammed onto an airport bus, rather than have the convenience of using the jetbridge.

### "express our sincere gratitude"
My wife and I recently faced unexpected challenges during our journey from the US to Munich, Germany with Icelandair. Heavy snowfall shut down the Munich airport for an extended period of time, which turned our original 50-minute layover in Reykjavik into an unexpected 2-day stay. Icelandair's response was exceptional. They quickly arranged comfortable hotel accommodations nearby and provided meal vouchers, easing the inconvenience. The team's communication and proactive assistance during the flight delays were commendable. I want to express our sincere gratitude to Icelandair for their handling of a very challenging situation. They provided outstanding customer service. Thank you, Icelandair!

### "lesson is anything but Icelandair"
I wish I'd read other reviews on this site before purchasing tickets. I bought 5 tickets with upgraded seats in February 2023 for a flight in December 2023. A week before the flight, I received an email encouraging me to upgrade our seats; when I looked, I saw we had been downgraded and redistributed in separate seats throughout the plane. I was confused because it appeared I had the option to repurchase the upgraded seats I'd already paid for. I was frustrated because two members of our party are elderly and in wheelchairs, and one is a toddler, which is why I paid extra to preselect roomier seats together in the first place. When I called customer service, the agent apologized and placed us back together, so I assumed the issue was resolved. A day later I looked again and saw that the toddler had once again been separated to the back of the plane. I called customer service again. Rather than move the toddler to sit with us, the second agent again redistributed the five of us around the plane. I called again. The third agent offered to let me pay again to upgrade our seats, while informing me that the airline could not guarantee that children sit with their parents or that our upgraded seats would not again be downgraded and we would be split up. So, IcelandAir's apparent policy is: we can't guarantee families will sit together, so you should upgrade, but even if you upgrade we'll still split you up and ask you to upgrade again, with no credit for the prior purchase. What a joke. Never again. I've learned my lesson, and the lesson is anything but IcelandAir.

### “Company is terrible”
Not Verified | Company is terrible. Lost our luggage coming home and there was no response from the company. Avoid them at all cost - the customer service is no good as they are not a major carrier in the US. I called Icelandair headquarters for 8 months trying to find out bags and they were never returned to us with no explanation.

### “will force you to pay”
We got charged $75 per standard USA size carry-on and 10kg (as they required) luggage. Stay away if you from any civilized county with standard luggage sizes, Icelandair will force you to pay.

### "unacceptable customer relations"
I booked round trip flight for 3 night vacation at Blue Lagoon, Iceland scheduled for December 9-13. My hotel is located in the southwest peninsula of Iceland which the Iceland government has closed because of earthquake and volcanic activity. The entire region is completely inaccessible to the general public, roads are destroyed, residents have been evacuated, and my hotel is closed indefinitely. I asked Iceland air to either refund my ticket or allow me to reschedule to a later date. They flat out refused claiming that I bought a nonrefundable ticket and that my flight has not been cancelled by them. Seems to me that such an intransigent position is unreasonable in light of a natural disaster that is beyond anyone’s control or ability to predict. I’ve made several calls to the airline and sent emails to company executives to no avail. Completely unacceptable customer relations!

### "worst experience on an international flight"
My worst experience on an international flight ever! I went to Europe on another airline but returned on Icelandair. On my flight to Europe this airline provided 2 full meals and earphones at no extra cost. My flights home were on Icelandair. It was double the cost and provided none of the above. The first plane to Iceland was older and smelled badly. When transferring to the second plane in Iceland, de-planing and re-planing was done outside in the cold and required going up and downstairs carrying my own luggage. In the airport, all passengers had to stand in line (no seating) behind a locked door waiting for group of passengers to board another flight. And prior to boarding the flight, staff did manual a inspection of passports which delayed the flight from leaving. Once on the flight, I had to remove dead bugs from the window and their was no WIFI. On this 8 hour flight, only coffee, tea, water etc. was offered and this was infrequent.

### "I do not recommend this airline"
Terrible airline and airport services in Reykjavik. It is total chaos in the airport, no organization and no Icelandair staff to help. After a chaotic check in and boarding, we had to wait for more than 2 hours on the ground waiting for more than 50 passengers to board. Cabin crew left with no information. I do not recommend this airline.

### "did not show up for the flight"
I purchased a ticket from Denver to London via Reykjavik. From London I flew to Greece with a different airline. On my return ticket I saw it is possible to have a layover if a couple of days in Reykjavik to see Iceland and I added a 2 night layover. My flight was on 24 sept from London to Reykjavik and then return on 26 September to Denver. I decided to fly from Greece straight into Reykjavik on 24 Sept and I was going to continue my flight back to Denver on the 26th. To my surprise at the airport they told me because I didn’t come on my flight from London, they cancelled my ticket from Reykjavik to Denver. I was forced to spend 550$ and buy another ticket to return to Denver. I have never had such experience in my entire life. They have closed my original ticket, because I did not show up for the flight. I will never fly with this airline again! On the flight to Reykjavik from Denver on 17 September, they also did not bring the meal I ordered and I have celiac disease so I couldn’t get anything on the plane because it had gluten. The flight attendant just told me that I’ll get reimbursed for it or maybe it’s for my other flight. This company is worse than any of the low cost airlines from Europe or USA. I do not recommend and will never fly with them again.

### "Not recommended at all"
Not Verified | Tiny seats, no food included in the price (1300$) for more than 10h flights, you can enjoy movies but only if you bring your own ear sets, otherwise are 4 extra dollars to buy one, and no free drinks served for such long flights. Not recommended at all!

### "abysmal customer service"
Originally purchased seat upgrades from SAV to KEF, our flight was cancelled due to unknown reasons and rebooked without seat upgrades. When we requested a refund for the seat upgrades they gave us the $160, but cancelled the return leg of our flight saying that we requested a refund. The customer service rep Pam was extremely rude, and would not listen to what I was telling her about our refund request and how in the note it said “refund for seat upgrades only”. She just repeatedly told me that since we requested it l, it was cancelled and a refund for the flight was issued. $160 for our $2000 flight. Despite telling her several times that refund request was just for the seat upgrades that the airline could no longer provide. She was extremely rude, refused to escalate the issue, and provided no help at all. Aside from the abysmal customer service, at 6ft tall my knees were crammed in the back of the seat in front of me. The flight crew were inattentive and ride when asked for anything. Drink carts were brought out at the start of the flight and at the end of the 6 hour flight only. The whole experience was awful. Iceland is a beautiful country but if this is your only way to get to Iceland I’d recommend going somewhere else.

### "Awful experience"
I paid for the luggage to go from Seattle to Barcelona and from Barcelona back to Seattle. When I went to the airport they wouldn't refund my money and they told me I have to call Icelandair. When I called to get a refund they refuse to even take my claim or to transfer me with a supervisor. On top of that, the flight attendants were extremely rude, we had to go up stairs with luggage, baby, carry-ons, baby strollers and more, and take a bus who was extremely rough driving and made a lot of people fall (no seats available on the bus). Awful experience, never again.

### "never book with this airline again"
We booked an economy roundtrip ticket from Toronto to London via Reykjavík and back to Toronto from Berlin again via Reykjavík. We knew that we had to pay for our checked in luggage (which is so weird for an international flight paid over $1,500 but OK). However, when we were about to check in one luggage on the way back to Toronto, we got the notification that we have to pay twice for 2 itineraries, one from Berlin to Reykjavík and one from Reykjavík to Toronto for a total of $130 for 1 luggage. Super disappointed and did not check in my luggage. Also, they served nothing than water or coffee. I had a short layover in Reykjavík with my kid, I had to run and buy stuff from the closest store to our gate in Reykjavík for $$$. I don't recommend the airline and will never book with this airline again unless is free plus some rewards.

### "no included meal or snacks"
Not Verified |  I don’t think I would ever fly with Icelandair again. When walking to the boarding gate they had said my carry on was too large and they could check it which was no problem. During the 8 hour flight it took roughly 2 hours to get water and to my surprise there was no included meal or snacks throughout the flight. I am not sure if that is a normal occurrence, but I am not impressed with the lack of service and accommodation that this airline provides. After claiming my baggage the handle that retracts is broken and I’m hoping to get in contact with them however they haven’t emailed back, would avoid this airline if you can!

### "I wouldn’t recommend this airline"
Terrible experience. We had a business class direct flight from BWI to KEH and they canceled the flight do to weather. Clear sky in both locations and another flight flew the same route at the same time with a different airline perfectly fine. It’s terrible how airlines do what they please and make excuses all so they don’t have to refund you. They then rebooked our 5 hour direct flight into a 14 hour trip through London with a 4 hour layover. Someone should be able to keep airlines like this accountable for false cancellations. I wouldn’t recommend this airline to my worst enemy.

### "refused to cover minimal delay compensation"
I wouldn't fly Icelandair if you want your luggage to arrive with you. I checked my bag 4.5hrs before flight on Aug 17 from Reykjavik to Denver. It never arrived and sat in Denver 4 days while they tried to figure out where Flagstaff, Arizona was (6 flights daily Denver to Flag via American airlines. Then stupidly sent it to Tucson where it still sits a week later (8/24) and they refused to cover minimal delay compensation. They absolutely suck, you get what you pay for and it ends up costing you more in time, trouble, money and emails than flying with a more reputable airline which do correct their mistakes when they occur such as delayed or lost baggage.

### "flight was horrifically delayed"
Not Verified |  Saga Class, Denver to Amsterdam via Keflavik. Flight delays for over an hour. Wrong name on ticket led to my needing to spend an additional $1,200 to change my name (which they again got wrong) even while I was told it would be a simple fix. Drinks in business class were warm, so no champagne or white wine. They were warm on all 4 flights we took including two legs in Economy class. Only one of the last 6 flights we've taken with them was on time, every other flight was horrifically delayed without much communication. One flight was delayed by two hours while we were standing in line 3 hours early and only my wife was notified and she shared it with me, who made the reservations, and also several people in line who didn't receive the notification. We paid over $5k US for Saga class and it's nothing more than the seat you are paying for as the level of service is dismal. In flight wifi never worked on any leg not even when we paid $12 for access. I was taken to a room and patted down and had every item of mine tested for gunpowder residue they said because it was random but this was following multiple delays a near missed connection, a name issue on my tickets that cost me more money and terrible service all around. They refused to give us a set of the cheap headphones when the wifi didn't work. There was no meal served on an 8 hour flight. The seats are so old there is zero padding so we had to sit on the pillows and couldn't get another one for our heads. Just awful and everything you think of when you think of a budget airline.

### "this is the worst airline"
After 80 countries visited, this is the worst airline. Nickel and dime you, including some of the highest baggage costs for an international flight. Every other airline accepts the standard carry on, but they don't. Their sizes are different than other airlines. We paid to reserve seats and at no time did they tell us the seats we reserved were limited recline. Why did I pay for one of the only few seats that doesn't recline. Boarding process seems scattered and hectic. Not a fan and will look elsewhere for flights to Europe and iceland.

### "seat upgrade and meals can't be refunded"
Buyer beware! I bought a nonrefundable ticket in December and was unexpectedly laid off in July. I purchased meals and upgraded seats for two passengers for a trip in September. I understand I could not get a refund for the basic airfare but I don't understand why the seat upgrade and meals can't be refunded. They will not even give me a travel credit. They are really kicking a person when they're down.

### "no issues and got me there on time"
Not Verified | The flight was fine - ample legroom, nice entertainment options, clean onboard bathrooms and pleasant staff. The food  kinda sucked and you have to pay for it. Icelandair was great - no issues and got me there on time.

### "I will never fly Icelandair again"
The day before our flights I was told our business class seats were being downgraded. Turned out only one leg of the trip was downgraded. We requested a wheelchair for my husband. No wheelchair was in sight when we landed in Seattle. We had another flight to catch so my husband started walking. No one with a wheelchair came to our rescue. I found a wheelchair and pushed the wheelchair while towing and carrying our luggage. The customs agent said that it is common for there to be no one with a wheelchair even when requested. After arriving home, I received an email stating that only half of the fare between business and economy class would be refunded. I will never fly Icelandair again.

### "told they can't help with anything"
Absolutely disgusting. Two flights delayed, which caused me two connecting flights so I had to buy new ones. Zero help. The first cancelled flight Icelandair didn't even tell me they had delayed the flight to the day after, as the travel agency only told me the ticket was cancelled. I had to buy a hotel and another ticket because of the missed connecting flight. I tried calling their customer service but was basically told they can't help with anything. The added expenses have cost more than the first tickets and rather than spending 7 hours on the flight I've spend over 48 hours and sleeping in Keflavik airport on the floor.

### "customer service became condescending"
Not Verified |  Deceptive gate agent in origin city resulted in over charge for baggage upon arrival to Keflavik. Obtuse customer service became condescending and did not resolve my issues. I do not recommend traveling with them.

### "our seats were not available"
Not Verified |  We purchased our business class tickets in January of 2023. When we arrived at SEA, we were told that we had been notified of an airplane change (they didn't notify us) and our seats were not available. We flew the 757-200 plane that had been booked (lie number one). Our seats had just been assigned to someone else. I book Business/First Class seats because that is the way I want to fly. There was no equipment change. IcelandAir overbooked Business Class and too bad for the people that they have to bump.

### "they do not offer dairy free meals"
I have a big complaint — they do not offer dairy free meals. I’m flying Saga class on an international airline and you’d think they would offer something for people who are made sick by dairy. They do not. They only offer “lactose reduced” which means the food will have casein and whey. So right now I’m very angry with them. When I called before I left Portland, the woman on the phone told me that if only I’d called 48 rather than 24 hours previous I’d have had a meal. So this time I just called three days ahead and no such dairy free meal exists. Business class. Unbelievable. And the comfort level of the seating was far below American, United, and British Airways. I was a fool not to read all the Skytrax reviews first. Next time I’ll know better.

### "I had just been replaned""
Was booked on a flight from Copenhagen to Reykjavik and onto Toronto that was supposed to leave at 2:00 today and put me in Toronto at 7:00 EST this evening. At 6:00 a.m. this morning, I get a notification that the flight has been cancelled due to circumstances "beyond their control" and I am rebooked on a flight leaving at 5:00 p.m. and putting me in Toronto at 10:00 p.m. EST. I went to the airport and found out that the flight had not been cancelled; I had just been "replaned". I called their "customer service" department (which is a complete contradiction in terms) and after advising what happened and requesting to be put back on my original flight, I was put on hold and when the person returned, she simply repeated what i had already told her. After thanking her for reminding me what i had already told her, I asked about getting on the original plane and was advised that it was full. I asked how I was randomly chosen a few hours before the flight and was met with silence expect to be told to check with the gate staff and maybe they could "squeeze me in. Spoke with the gate staff supervisor and she again informed me that i was on the 5:00 flight and this one was full. I showed her my boarding pass indicating that i was supposed to be on this flight. She wasn't sure what to say and just said, this was full. In my waiting, i have read the reviews of Icelandair and realize that it is my fault for not reading them in advance as I have only read 2 out of 127 so far that have anything remotely positive to say. Fortunately, I won't know as I will never set foot on one of their planes again. I am submitting an overall review of 1 as the site won't let me submit a 0.

### "never consider flying with them again"
Not Verified |  Having booked 3 Saga (Business Class) return tickets, I was surprised to learn, by checking the seats, so no warning from the airline, that my daughter who is travelling with her brother and mother, has been bumped off the flight from Seattle to Iceland. The original seats that had been pre-allocated changed with my wife and son not even sitting together. Oddly she still has her seat on the Iceland to London leg, which is of little use if she can't get to Iceland ! So after hours of trying to get through to them to find out what on-earth has happened, they said they had changed the plane to one with less Saga seating and hence she was not allocated a seat! They offered no explanation but saidd she would probably get on the flight in economy, but would not guarantee it and would not allocate a seat to her in economy! So right now my wife is faced with the prospect of having to arrive at checking with the chance she has to leave our daughter behind in Seattle airport, which she clearly cannot do. Despite my many protests at the insanity of the situation, they said that's just the way it is. I'm shocked at the appalling behaviour and attitude of the customer service with no waring. I would never consider flying with them again.

### "The experience was horrible"
The experience was horrible. No food, no water. To top the most terrible ordeal they didn’t put the baggage in the plane. After 2 days, over 20 phone calls and 3 trips to the airport and paying $70.00 for parking to claim the baggage, we are finally relieved. The number they provide is a call centre and has nothing to do with the airline. The number for them in Toronto is just an answering machine telling to email them. I absolutely don’t recommend this airline to anyone. This was the only and last time we used them. So far no apology and no compensation from them. It’s so terrible feeling when you pay for the service and instead you get pain and suffering.

### "This is not the Icelandair we knew pre-covid"
Not Verified | Southampton, to Glasgow, to Keflavik, to Baltimore. This airline choses to partner with Loganair out of Southampton. Ok fine. Partner with a regional airline. The problem is they are incapable of handling your transit. We checked in with Loganair, because the Icelandair app sends you there. With Logan we are only able to check in for our first flight. We checked our bags all the way through to our final destination. Guess what? We are home, they are not. Surprise of all surprises, the two airlines do not communicate at all with each other even though Icelandair put us on the Loganair flight. Loganair and Southampton airport are incapable of providing your boarding passes for any follow-on flight. So, once we arrived in Glasgow, we had to exit the security area and find the Icelandair check-in counter which was not manned for over an hour. Once we were able to check in, the counter agent had to locate our luggage to make sure it got on our plane. She did find it and accomplish that much. She also provided us boarding passes for our follow-on flights. Once we boarded our plane about 40 minutes late (partly because we watched the flight crew taking selfies at the jetway for 15 minutes), we sat in the plane until we were over an hour late for our departure. Well, there goes our hour and a half layover in Keflavik. We arrived a full hour and 40 minutes late, and had to run from one plane to the next. We got our passports checked 5 times in Keflavik. Once to get off the plane, once to get back in the building, once to get in line for our flight, again while we were in line, and then finally to board the plane. This flight was late as well. Not because they were waiting for passengers from connecting flights, but just because they hadn’t bothered to fuel or clean the plane for the flight. They started doing that when we were supposed to be taking off. Of course, in all the time we wasted in the airport while this happened and everyone was getting passports checked needlessly by random airline personnel (not actual security personnel) our luggage did not get moved from one plane to the next. To no one’s surprise, our luggage didn’t make the connection. So, I checked my tile app, and low and behold, we arrived in BWI late, and our luggage, still sitting in Keflavik. In fact, as I write this, it is still there, 12 hours after I filed a missing luggage claim. Several Icelandair flights have come into BWI since, but not our luggage. The worst part, is I couldn’t file a claim with Icelandair, because no one was at work in Baltimore (shocker). We had to file with the airport itself. Icelandair has yet to respond and even though they are “opened for business” have not answered the phone yet. I just get a loop of automated nonsense. This is not the Icelandair we knew pre-covid. This is Icelandair if it were being run by monkeys with traumatic brain injuries.

### "felt totally ripped off"
Not Verified | Booked R/T from Boston to Stockholm via Iceland, 6/2 flying Economy Flex. Offered bid to upgrade from economy to Saga/ Business prior to departure. We bid. 2 days before departure, was told our bid was accepted on the flight from Iceland to Stockholm and we would fly Saga/Business class. On day of departure we were told that the flight from Iceland to Stockholm would be on a "replacement" plane because they apparently ran out of their regular planes. Research indicated that the plane we were put on was run by a company in Sofia, Bulgaria. The plane was an AirbusA321. It was first put into service in 1994, almost 30 years ago. Were also told the replacement would have no WiFi, no USB ports, and no entertainment system for the 3+ hour flight. When we boarded it it appeared to be older and not very up to date. After taking our seats in the front row we were offered one cellophane wrapped croissant each which turned out to be stale and soggy. On it were a slice of ham, a slice of cheese, and a wilted piece of lettuce. I've had better food in economy. Then we were offered orange juice, apple juice or water, period. No refills were offered. During the entire 3+ hour flight no one attended to us or provided any food, drinks, not even coffee. I was livid. Icelandair wasted no time, of course, charging our credit card for the $560 we bid. When I eventually complained we were offered 10,000 Saga points (cash value $48USD). I refused, demanding a full refund. The final refund they agreed to give us was $74. Pathetic. We felt totally ripped off and we were.

### "our experience will make us think twice"
Not Verified |  Flew from Toronto, YYZ to Iceland connecting to Finland on June 12, 2023. Second time flew via Iceland/Finland. Did not have the same experience, experience was good before, however this time we were asked to give our carry-on luggage to be checked in and we were told our carry-on did not meet the required measurement. Don't understand this, carry on had been used several times during trips, the latest on our Caribbean Cruise in April 2023, with no problem. Although, the staff were very nice and professional and just doing her job, we had to open my luggage and removed our prescription meds we were taking with us. When boarded, in the plane noticed 2 passengers had larger carry on bags than mine. My husband and I are rule followers and we felt this airline practiced discrimination and inconsistency in enforcing rules for passengers. In fact one of the passengers in the plane made a comment to a passenger why his carryon was accepted since his luggage was huge and should have been denied. The passenger involved could not comment because it was not his fault his luggage was approved. Despite this experience we had, the crew members were nice, professional and accommodating but our experience will make us think twice before booking our next flight with Icelandair in the future. Unfortunately, we have to return to Toronto June 23 and hope our carry-on that was denied will be approved this time and we will then make future decision whether to fly with Icelandair for our next trip to Finland in the future.

### "staff is rude and disrespectful"
Not Verified | The staff is rude and outright disrespectful. Despite paying for seats they will move you and act like you were the problem when you are upset to be moved from a seat you paid for. The staff is extremely rude and condescending and your better off just booking a higher priced airline ticket because after all the fees and the combined on board headache you mine as well

### "Worst flight and rudest service"
Icelandair had leased an additional aircraft to operate our flight. Flight attendants were so rude. They yelled at customers and tossed food and drinks around as If they hated their job. Worst flight and rudest service ever. Icelandair didn't operate this hellish flight themselves, but they are responsible for what company they lease aircraft from. Definitely not worth the tickets we paid for. The other flight operated by Icelandair themselves went as it should.

### "one of the worst airlines in Europe"
This is one of the worst airlines in Europe. Expensive and its even more expensive to change your booking. The staff are very rude and service is horrible. They delay flights at will and repeatedly give wrong information about flights. Take your business elsewhere.

### "non-transferable and non-refundable"
I booked my reservation on April 17, 2023 for travel 7 months down the road in November. This will be my 1st and probably last booking on Icelandair. I booked the flight myself on the Icelandair website. My goal was to pay for 1 additional bag on the outbound flight from Boston to Iceland, but I made a mistake. Immediately after confirming the booking on the website I received an e-mail detailing the booking. At that time, I noticed the additional bag fee of $55 was for the return flight from Iceland to Boston. I immediately called Icelandair customer service and explained to them that I made a my mistake. They said "there is no way to book an extra bag on the outbound flight until checking in at the counter on the day of travel, since I am departing on a partner airline of Icelandair and no refund will be granted. I explained that I had made a mistake and am calling customer service hours after confirmation of the booking. The rep told me that I could write to their customer support about my issue, which I did. Their response "Thank you for contacting us, and choosing to fly Icelandair. Unfortunately, we are unable to fulfill your request as extra baggage purchases are non-transferable and non-refundable. The terms and conditions of baggage purchases can be reviewed below". It's not the $55 but the principle of the matter. I made a mistake and immediately contacted Icelandair about it and non-refundable is unacceptable. I even asked for a credit to be used on future travel or food stuff, but there was no acceptance by Icelandair.

### "decently pleasant experience"
Not Verified | I would have to say that I was quite thourghly suprised with my experience on Icelandair. I was at first a bit scared to fly with them after reading some of their reviews on here but I took my courage into my own hands and booked a ticket with them for my upcoming endeavour in Iceland. The ground crew at Pearson wasn't the greatest as usual and were a bit cold and unfriendly but were serviceable. Boarding thankfully started on time and without much off a hassle, but unfortunately our departure time was delayed by more then an hour thanks to some late connecting passengers and the rush to find and successfully load their baggage. I have to give a special shoutout to our crew on this particular flight as they were absolutely lovely and were almost constantly present in the aisle checking on passengers. The flight itself was perfectly fine, the seat was comfortable enough with a fair amount of legroom and the IFE screen was modern and responsive with a good selection of both local and foreign features. The only drawbacks I would say for this flight would be the lack of a complimentary meal (although the food options were all reasonably priced and looked decent) and the fact that the inflight WiFi didn't work at all during the entirety on both flights that I flew with them. Overall it was a decently pleasant experience and I would certainly recommend and fly with them again.

### "very attentive crew"
We departed from Keflavik at time 16.04. 2023 FI 324. Saga premium class, seat 3 A/ 3D. Had a very good experience with a crew which really was professional, and friendly. Travelled with my spouse. The snack and drinks were very good, the salmon was excellent. We really appreciated the journey due to this very attentive crew. The Saga lounge at Keflavik airport is also a very peaceful and comfortable place, with a great buffet.

### "a refund or compensation"
New York JFK to Keflavík on 21st January. I was supposed to land in Iceland at 6am after a flight from NYC, but due to the weather, we were stuck inside a plane for over 10 hours upon arrival. No food or water were provided and no updates available. After 16 hours of being on the plane we were able to get out, no apologies or explanations were provided. I tried to reach out to the airline for a refund or compensation of some sort but have not received a response after 2 months. My return flight to NYC was a similar horrific experience when a flight got delayed and overbooked which caused me to miss my connecting flight upon arrival. Yet again no explanation was provided except a smirky comment from the flight attendants that at least we made it to NY. Would not recommend to anyone.

### "Nothing good to say here"
Nothing good to say here. One hour layover in Keflavik (12/18/22) turned into the 4 days. Still awaiting reimbursement (mid March 2023). Airline was completely unhelpful in helping to find accommodations or making our overnight in airport remotely eased for our senior bodies, airport staff went out of their way to make it worse. Paid extra for leg room on every part (didn't happen) and add an hours delayed flight with med emergency en route and we ended up flying into closest, soonest metro airport, renting car for return to get home before Christmas. A travel nightmare. Still awaiting reimbursement 3 months later.

### "Staff not most helpful"
Poor service, self check in and self baggage service. Staff not most helpful. Multiple halts on boarding the plane, which is likely to be delayed. Packed us in the shuttle bus like sardines. Will not recommend flying with Icelandair, but you don't have much choice when you want to visit Iceland.

### "not refund my $150 for seat selection"
We purchased seat selection with our tickets. Icelandair canceled our tickets and delayed our flight by 24 hours. You can’t call anyone in customer service. we were promised compensation for a hotel and I was also promised by the gate agent that I’d receive a refund for the seat selection since our rebooked flight had our seats scattered across the plane. I submitted both forms for reimbursement and they don’t even give you a confirmation number just a “thanks someone will be in touch soon”. I just received an email that they will not refund my $150 for seat selection (note I didn’t ask for a full ticket refund, just the seat selection upgrade of 5 tickets x $30). I try to call in and no one will help or explain why. I still have not received a response about hotel reimbursement and no one can tell me when that will happen. Very disappointed with this airline.

### "It’s a complete nightmare"
We chose Icelandair for our trip to Europe for the possibility of spending a few hours in Reykjavik and visiting the city for a one day layover. Our experience started horribly, with our flight being rebooked less than a week before departure. We arrived at the airport and no carry ins were allowed in economy, only to see many passengers in economy with a carry on bag the same size as ours. They damaged all of our suitcases. And now on the way back, our flight was once again cancelled and rebooked. It’s a complete nightmare and their customer service is the same as nothing. If you have to fly this airline, don’t even go! You will save yourself a lot of grief!

### "agent did the best to get me home in a timely manner"
I had a return trip home to Canada for Christmas, while my flights to Canada were canceled a day in advance due to incoming bad weather, they did immediately rebook me on another flight to get me back to Canada, and when I called their agent did the best they could to get me home in a timely manner. While my flights back to Canada were a disaster that was not Icelandair's fault. I was booked automatically on British Airways and Air Canada flights as there were no other flights to Toronto with Icelandair for a few days. As I was let down by the other two airlines with delays, missed connections stranding me in London for the night, and then losing my luggage for 18 days. I was pretty anxious to fly back to Glasgow. The Check-in for my luggage was quick and easy, and they also printed one boarding pass for both of my journeys. They were very communicative with passengers as we waited for boarding to begin. While it is not very organized boarding, it went by quickly. I did pre order food, which I was satisfied with. I don't typically sleep on flights, but they did provide a blanket and pillow already placed on your seat. As well, I saw them walk around the plane offering water to passengers throughout the 5 hour flight. The way I booked my flights to Scotland left me with an hour layover in Iceland. But as we landed they explained what we had to do if we were connecting to UK and Ireland, which was to walk directly to gate and avoid passport control and security again. That flight was just as well equipped as the last, where I had a comfortable seat with good leg room better than other airlines I've flown on.

### "Awful customer service and experience"
Not Verified | Awful customer service and experience. They nickel and dime you. The flight was cancelled. They wouldn’t release my spot to make other accommodation. I was then out hundreds of dollars for my hotel and missed tours. They ended up canceling the second flight too. Now it’s two weeks later, I have yet to receive a refund. You open a ticket to which they close saying it’s been refunded. I’ve replied twice saying it hasn’t. No response. I called and they can’t do anything or escalate it.

### "We will never fly them again!"
Not Verified |  Paid for meals and upgraded seats. We were assigned our original seats (not the upgraded we paid for). When we got to our destination I called the airline and the representative walked me how to request a refund online. I did file a refund request and Iceland air replied "it is not our policy to refund for purchased seat upgrades if you reached your destination". We will never fly them again! You also have to purchase all food. They didn't give away a cracker.

### "more time in the airports than in New York"
Not Verified | Our flight got delayed from New York to Iceland from 7pm until way later. When we arrived at Iceland they swapped our flight to Hi Fly I think and they were so kind, but we waited 2 hours until the flight actually departed, but that’s Icelandair's fault. We arrived at London Heathrow and we waited for our luggage from 8:30pm to 10:00pm and it turns out they left our luggage in Iceland. Thankfully everyone in the other airports were very nice, saying they’ll reimburse us, giving us a free hotel for the night as we have a disabled person with us and also giving us meal vouchers. They told us we wont get our luggage until Christmas Eve, meaning we won’t get to relax on Christmas Eve and we’ll be having to unpack. Another woman on the flight, she was only meant to be in Iceland for the weekend, and there were no flights until today. The staff in Iceland just left them without any information of any flights they can take and thankfully they got the flight that departed today. Whatever you do, don’t fly Icelandair, some of the staff are rude, they’re disorganised and don’t care about anyone and are just plainly selfish. I wanted to have a nice holiday in New York but when I look back at the holiday which I just had, all I see is the stress they put us through and not the memories we had in New York. We spent more time in the airports than we did in New York.

### "Will never fly with them again"
Cancel your flight due to weather. Can't help that. But then turn off all phones and chat for 3 days so you cannot speak with anybody and just leave you in limbo. Will never fly with them again.

### "awful way of doing business"
Chicago to Copenhagen via Keflavik. Cancelled flight 12 hours before we were leaving, although flight is arriving in Chicago and returning to Europe tonight. Who gets to stay on, we did not, awful way of doing business, never again

### "Onboard service was excellent"
Zurich to Keflavík in Saga Class. This was a near-flawless flight. Icelandair uses the mediocre Aspire Lounge at Zurich Airport. The 757 is part of Icelandair's old fleet and is being phased out with the induction of the new 737 MAX aircraft. While the incoming aircraft was slightly delayed, they made up for for the lost time with an on-time arrival into Keflavík. Onboard service was excellent. The Indian/Asian vegetarian meal was not. Icelandair's Wi-Fi, when it works, is among the best in the business and is complimentary for Saga Class passengers.

### "flight to Zurich was uneventful"
Keflavík to Zurich in Saga Class. Despite its uneven standards, Icelandair provides the most comfortable experience for travel between Iceland and Europe. It is perhaps the only airline that provides something like a premium experience in Business Class for inter-Europe travel. The Saga Lounge at Keflavík airport is among the better lounges of its type. Check-in and boarding at Keflavík went without any glitch. Priority boarding was honoured. The new 737 MAX is noticeably quieter than its earlier versions. The flight to Zurich was uneventful. We had requested an Indian/Asian vegetarian meal but what was served had "Indian/Asian" missing from it. But for a 3+ hours flight, no big deal. Wi-Fi is included in the Saga Class ticket on Icelandair. When it works it is the best internet connection in the sky.

### "Don't book a flight with Icelandair"
We booked tickets Stockholm (Sweden) to Reykjavik. When departure from Sweden we got delayed by one hour. No one from the crew said anything during the delay and gave the passengers information. A few days later we got an email stating that they cancelled our direct flight home. We contacted Icelandair to get information and a competition. no respond from the costumer service. A few messages later they replied with nonsense information that didn't help me as a customer. So the only option we had was the "new" triangle flight: first Keflavik to Oslo. Then Oslo to Stockholm. And this flight got so delayed. A trip that should take some 3 hours have now turned up to eight hours, from when the flight first should have taken off to when we landed in Sweden. And again: no information from the crew, no sorry. I've never experienced anything like this before. Don't book a flight with Icelandair

### "wouldn't select carrier again"
Not Verified |  Fairly satisfactory. East bound but delayed going out from Zurich. Meal payment for first leg, was put on second leg. Arrived late into Iceland, chaotic airport with numerous delays. Seat configuration changed to a 757 with more seats and I was put onto a mid seat. Sub par food. Aircraft full and air stagnant. Seats narrow and hard. Entertainment very limited. Overall, wouldn't select carrier again.

### "Icelandair is a bunch of scammers"
I have never heard of a transatlantic, overnight flight not providing a free meal or at least free snacks. They also don’t provide headphones like most other airlines do that plug into the tv on the back of seats. Then, coming home, there was a blizzard in Iceland and every major road was closed. We physically have no way to make it to the airport. We called, explained this, and they still charged us around $600 to change the flight. Like what do you want me to do, teleport? Is it my fault your government closes the roads when it suddenly snows 3 feet without warning? No other airline would do that. Stick with United, they let you change your flight for free. Icelandair is a bunch of scammers.

### "My first time on Icelandair was good"
Not Verified |  My first time on Icelandair was good. Thanks to the check-in crew, all my baggage was free for check-in. The seating was okay, but the inflight entertainment was very modest, with little excitement or a variety of options. All I had was nothing but free drinks.

### "not recommend this agency to anyone"
I was with a group of seven to go on vacation together to Iceland. When we found out we were booked at 4 different hotels through Icelandair Holidays, we immediately tried to get some help with making the changes. After multiple phone calls being told no one could help with that part of the trip, and more emails than I could count, we tried to reschedule in hopes we could rectify by selecting another date and starting over. We never once got to speak to an agent and we finally cancelled the trip altogether. Not only did we lose 30% of the booking fee, but our prepaid seats and the prepaid meals for another $177.20 per couple for something that never even got to be used. I don’t understand how this was not refundable! Would not recommend this agency to anyone!

### "enough to keep me away for good"
Not Verified |  Recommending to use any other airline. I've had trouble since booking and very unhelfpul interactions at every stage since. Situation was admittedly my fault: that I booked an itinerary (four flights total), and one flight had the wrong starting airport. My booking was for a non-refundable, non-cancellation ticket, which was the cheapest option, and I booked one month in advance. I noticed my mistake the day after booking and immediately called customer service, noting that I'd made an error and was there anything that could be done. Said I was willing to pay an up-charge, would like to stay with them, and was apologetic. Was told absolutely nothing could be done, per the policy. When asked if there was anyone else I might be able to speak to, I was said I could call back and hear the same response if I liked. I did that. The next agent told me there was no option, but that if I bought another ticket ($400), he'd be happy to help me speak with a refund team about getting back an airline tax. Would not tell me an amount but said it was negligible, and when I asked if he could find out, he said the refund team doesn't have a phone number and wouldn't engage until I paid up. Asked where I could submit a complaint and that was that. My complaint was this: by helping out a customer who made a mistake once, they would keep my business and very likely get the added bonus of another customer paying for the seat I gave up. As it stands, they get the certainty of losing my business and my family's business for good. While this exact situation is on me, and hasn't arisen with any other airline, I've received excellent conflict resolutions from other companies (thank you KLM, Lufthansa and Japan Air). Never have I had an experience like this anywhere else, and that's enough to keep me away for good.

### "an overall poor experience"
We booked a RT for two in business class departing on July 23, 2022. The night before our departure we were down graded to economy. Icelandair told us we would receive a refund. Almost 3 months have passed and despite several emails to the contrary we have yet to receive a refund for the service downgrade. Our return flight on September 3 involved a marathon hike through a congested airport, several long lines and a bus ride across the airport. We were seated in business for this leg of the trip, but he food was indifferent and the staff inattentive. It was an overall poor experience.

### "Very disappointed"
Very disappointed7 with icelandairs baggage handling and resolution. The initial flight was ok but I paid $76 for an extra bag upon returning to the USA. The bag didn't even get loaded on the aircraft. up in finding this out in Seattle I was promised that the bag would be with me the next day via courier since I live 2 hrs from the airport. It was not delivered and it is now day 3 and the bag has only just arrived in Seattle and is sat there (I have a tracker in it) and they consider the "case closed". Very very poor follow up and I will be pursuing this to the fullest extent the regulations allow if they expect me to come and get the bag from them.

### "my last time flying this airline"
Traveling with a group that decided to save money by flying Icelandair. This will be my last time flying this airline. There were many annoyances, but maybe the worst was changing my seat that was confirmed, which I know can happen if the plane is changed, but they separated me and my wife by 8 rows. And this happened to many other couples in our group. How hard is it not to do that? The connection in Reykjavík is short so there is no time to do anything in the airport, sometimes not even the restroom. The signs are terrible. On the way home there is no sign for international transfers, or even passport control. If you’ve never transferred in Iceland before you have to guess that you follow the “Departures” sign. Again, how hard is it to have a sign for this like every other airport on the planet? On the way out we arrived at the only gate that had no board for connections. With 10 minutes to get to the next gate and 40 people to keep track of you need every second. Other issues: legroom is bad and there are obstacles under many of the seats so if you need to put anything under there you end up, like me, without the ability to stretch your legs. Flight attendants are a mixed bag of nice and not very nice. The number of bathrooms on the plane was ridiculously small. My seat was in the middle of the plane and had no window. Never experienced that before. The app is horrible - I joined SAGA, but the app could not find my booking. Maybe because it was a group, but I did pay money so I would like some credit. The line at check-in was enormous, mainly because they don’t open very early at all. Again leaving little time to enjoy the airport, or get a bite to eat, even if you arrive 3 hours early. I could go on, but that’s enough. Buyer beware.

### "One of the poorest experiences flying I have had"
One of the poorest experiences flying I have had. The initial flight was late, causing me to miss my flight to BWI. Arrangements were made (finally) to transfer me to Icelandair FI853 to ORD Chicago, then to United Airlines UA2627 to IAD Washington. My ride home was waiting for me in BWI, where I should have arrived. Needless to say, I am still waiting for my luggage.

### "a bad product"
Surprisingly, a bad product. I agree, that I paid for the cheapest class, but did not realize they are a Low-Cost airline (price comparable to other legacy airlines). There is no complimentary food on the flight, even though it is a transatlantic flight. Our group (2 people) was not seated next to each other (which even SPIRIT airlines do) and the only way to change that - even during check in process is - if you pay for a seat change. When we boarded the plane, there were a plenty of free seats, so my belief is that it is only for taking money out of your pocket for inconveniencing you. Our first leg of journey was delayed, and hence we would not make the transfer. When calling the airline help desk - they said : "Just board the first flight and you will see what happens in Keflavik, we can't rebook you". After an hour from the call, the second leg was thankfully rebooked In flight-entertainment was poorer than competition (no games, not many movies with subtitles, flight show could not be panned / interactive) even had to pay to get your set of "airline quality" headset. The crew was nice, airplanes were new and clean, boarding was fairly fast, since it is a smaller plane. I had the impression that their model of "transatlantic hub in the middle of the route" would work better and they would offer a better quality of service to make up for the layover (compared to many direct Europe - US flights), but after flying with them I do not see why I should choose their option again. Price was very much the same as other airlines.

### "I won't fly them again"
Not Verified |  Pretty garbage airline. $900 for a ticket and it didn't even include food. I won't fly them again. KLM has a better route and service. The only thing I will say, is the service was polite and the plane was very clean.

### "the worst airline I have flown"
Not Verified |  Booked this flight which started in Seattle USA (SEATAC). I reside in Canada and work in the airlines industry when booking this flight. Phoned several times with extreme wait times and contract staff was in the Philippines and not of any assistance. The flight was ex SEATAC 7pm. The evening before zero communication. The next morning I check again and zero emails or text which was given to Icelandair. I try to check using chat after once again a very long wait time. Finally used google search and found out the flight time is now 4pm ex SEATAC. Residing in Canada we left without breakfast or even a shower to make the drive and park the car at SEATAC. The employee was more focused on my carry-on than checking for a connecting flight, I told her this carry-on meets regulations and has been used for 10 years with many airline carriers, I gave her the luggage. She was of no assistance to make sure we make the connection as with this earlier departure our wait time would be almost 11 hours in Iceland for a 2 hour flight. There was zero snack for over a 6 hour flight ... not even a cracker! We arrived and I went directly to Customer Service to ask for an earlier flight There were 2 flights and every passenger made that flight except us. We were at the airport for almost 11 hours, The airport was closed for 5 hours plus. When we arrive in Denmark the carry-on was not there. SAS staff looked for it for 2 hours as it was showing it arrived. Early next morning we boarded our Cruise ship without any clothing but was on my back, Only thanks to Roya Caribbean staff my carry-on arrived after being lost for 7 days. We had no luggage so it was just our carry-on. When the carry-on arrived it was damaged. To date the report which was filled out as soon as we returned and a letter to the airline in Iceland have they responded, It is now almost October 2022. This is and will be the worst airline I have flown.

### "allot seats separating your group on purpose"
If you book regular seats (without seat selection option at the time of check-in) as a group - family or couple, they will allot seats separating your group on purpose, so you end up paying for seats to sit together. You will find many empty seats next to each other if you decide to pay at check-in, but it's not automatic alloted to everyone who booked to travel together. Seems silly. Never experienced this with any other airline.

### "won't be using this airline in future"
While the actual flight was fine and I applaud the airline for transporting their own baggage handlers, there are are a couple of bizarre peculiarities. They don't provide any in-flight service on a transatlantic flight, unless you pre-purchase a meal. One would normally expect a basic meal to be included on a 7 hour flight. My husband, travelling back to Canada two weeks after me, decided to purchase one of the meals and accidentally selected an inappropriate meal (he's vegetarian) and called them immediately to sort it out. The customer service representative told him that nothing could be done to reverse or refund the order as it was against policy. Absolutely ridiculous. We won't be using this airline in future.

### "My flight was 8 hours late"
My flight from Keflavik to Frankfurt was 8 hours late due to technical problems of the aircraft. There was no catering at all provided by Icelandair during the waiting time, and no compensation for the delay was offered by them.

### "there was only food for purchase"
Not Verified |  After a delay due to weather, I missed my Air Canada connection to KEF. I chose to be put on the Icelandair flight 24 hrs later. Boarding was confusing. For a 6 hr flight, there was only food for purchase where Air Canada provided both a meal and snack. The beverage cart came around once with water offer several times later in the flight. The seat was small & uncomfortable and the movie selection very limited. Customs in KEF took forever as several flights landed at the same time. The good part? I got to KEF on time.

### "service is by far the worst"
Newark to Manchester via Reykjavik. This is my 3rd time using this route to visit home and each time I wonder why I take it other then the price. Reykjavik airport is a miserable place with no where to get anything decent to eat. The people are the rudest I’ve come across and very unhelpful. You’re lucky if the airline give you a glass of water, which considering the planes switch from steaming hot - no AC on the runway to be eco conscious - to freezing cold - excessive AC while flying. The seats have to be the smallest of any airline I’ve flown with and the service is by far the worst. This trip I had the unfortunate need to change my flight due to a medical emergency, I booked economy so wasn’t expecting much help. I got someone who after explaining that my son was in hospital undergoing major emergency surgery, had the audacity to tell me that “no shows” weren’t allowed! Seriously? She lectured me about giving me a one off change to my ticket and made me feel like I should be eternally grateful - then hit me with the “up charge” which was 50% of the cost of the original ticket. I will NEVER use this airline again.

### "stopover in Iceland breaks up the trip"
Not Verified |  Best airline for transatlantic travel with kids. I just traveled from Toronto to Berlin and back with two kids (5 and 7yrs old). The stopover in Iceland breaks up the trip more evenly (two medium duration flights), which was better for us than one really long and one really short flight. Also, kids get priority boarding, free food on the flight, a bag of interesting activities (stickers, games), and the entertainment system has a whole kid section. On our way back from Berlin we missed our connection because of a severe thunderstorm in Berlin (It was bad! Heavy winds and rain, thunder and lighting. I'm glad we didn't have to take off in those conditions). Once we arrived in Iceland and our flight to Toronto had left, Icelandair rebooked us on a flight for the next day and put us in a 5-star hotel for the night, with taxi, dinner, breakfast and lunch paid for. Our room had a view of the ocean and we had some time to explore the spectacular Icelandic coast. I was worried that we'd have to spend the night on a hard bench on the airport, instead we were treated to an extra day of vacation on this amazing island! Thank you, Icelandair! !

### "the aircraft is pretty nice"
Not Verified |  As someone who has never flown transatlantic with Icelandair before, it would be pretty interesting. I would say the aircraft is pretty nice. I would say charging $4 for headphones as well as having credit card computers not working was very disappointing. It was delayed at Keflavik because you were likely to come up at a remote stand and the bus would have to wait for the last passengers to come.

### "Great service onboard"
Not Verified |  Great service onboard Icelandair. Very kind flight attendants. Keflavik Airport ground handling made no priority stickers to luggage which resulted in long waiting at Munich.

### "worst flying experience I have ever had"
Not Verified |  I never write negative reviews but in this case my review will be scathing. We flew from Washington Dulles to Reykjavik and then onto Bergen. Return was Reykjavik to Washington Dulles. The international flight offers no food. You can purchase on line but all you get for a 5 1/2 hr flight is coffee, water or juice. They did serve some sort of chocolate marshmallow roll up that absolutely no one ate. It was an indescribable mass of I am not sure what and I won’t tell you what it looked like, unless you have a pet and then you can imagine what it looks like. The staff have a pasted smile on their face. Poor people working for a horrid airline. The seats are at a bad angle so the pressure is on your lower back. They managed to squeeze more people into a cramped space. There is no legroom, arm room or seat space. I sat next to a tall guy with long legs. Not his fault but I couldn’t sleep and he couldn’t find a comfortable position for all 6’4” of him. Upon our return there was no one at the gate to take luggage. No one cued, there was no guidance, no signage, no direction. So, when two people opened their kiosk, it was a mad dash. What a mess and dangerous too! Understaffed, poorly run, horribly executed check in. There was no process. I recommend that you never fly this airline. It was the worst flying experience I have ever had and I am an experienced world traveler. Perhaps if people stop booking on Iceland Air they will get the message. Choose any other airline. Buyer Beware.

### "The staff was wonderful"
The staff was wonderful. My luggage was lost on my return flight but arrived at my home in Pennsylvania. I received a call from Copenhagen. Everyone was so nice. The US staff was terrible in Baltimore when I arrived. Such a disappointment but nothing to do with Icelandair. My only complaint is that there was not enough air on the plane. The sun was on my side of the plane and heat was radiating thru the blind. I could not lay my head against the window because it was so hot. I am Closer to Harrisburg airport but chose to drive over an hour to Baltimore just so I could fly Icelandair! I will do it again!

### "What an awful experience"
Not Verified |  What an awful experience. The difficulties began while trying to extend a voucher (COVID 19 cancellation in 2021). Several times I waited an hour on hold before talking to customer service, who were either consciously or unwittingly deceiving. After several months of back and forth I finally got the voucher. The first leg of our flight from Boston to Coppenhagen via Rejkavik was one of the most uncomfortable I’ve experienced. The stewardesses were indifferent at best (the woman next to me sat with her meal for 2 hours before they came by to pick it up). The cabin was improperly ventilated. Hot and stuffy to the extent that my wife and I had headaches and nausea when we touched down. No wonder the stewardesses were grumpy. A day before the return flight Icelandair informs that there will be no Wi-Fi or in flight entertainment available. Which confirms my suspicion that Icelandair is a low budget airline charging high budget prices. I guess they can count on summer traffic from US and Europe to Iceland, so not much incentive to care about quality Never again.

### "worst airline we have ever experienced"
Not Verified |  This is the worst airline we have ever experienced. We were bumped for no reason except they over booked the flight. We arrived at the airport two hours ahead, yet our seats which we prepaid $80 per seat, were given away to other passengers, simply they were over booked! After four and half hours of waiting, they continue to claim we had no seat on the next flight. All of our repaid meals and extra legroom seats service were wasted as well.

### "one of my worst airline experiences"
This was one of my worst airline experiences. After delaying my flight out of LGW by 4 hours and being promised by customer service agents that it would not be a problem and they would figure out an easy solution for me when I arrived in KEF, they delayed my connection, but not enough for me to make my flight. There were only a couple other flights going to the US the rest of the night that were already overbooked because they had done the same thing to another flight that day. My only option was to be put in a hotel and take a flight 24 hours later. After finally arriving to the hotel I was supposed to stay in, the hotel informed us that they had run out of rooms and would transport us to a separate hotel. Not one Icelandair employee apologized or admitted that maybe they should not have reassured me many times that everything would be fine and I would be able to continue on to my final destination.

### "not responsible for my lost luggage"
Lost my luggage and wouldn’t reimburse or give me a voucher for a flight they were responsible for me missing. They said they are not responsible for my lost luggage and won’t reimburse me for it.

### "Flight attendants were not friendly"
Not Verified |  They don’t offer any food for flights that are well over 7 hours. They make you pay for earphones in order to watch in flight entertainment. Check in at the airport was awful, they opened check in 2 hours before the flight and the usual time is 3 hours. They don’t give any pillow or blankets on a flight in January, I asked for one and there was snot and dirt on it, I had to call the flight attendant to change it for me. Flight attendants were not friendly. So, never again

### "talked down to and plain disrespected"
One person in our family was denied boarding at MSP because of some three-month passport rule. My kid's passport expires this Fall and we had there-back tickets that would have been used long before. The manager who apparently doesn't even work for them - just contracted - made a suggestion to leave our child at the airport and for the rest of us to go on! Upon about an hour long discussion, she told me not to worry, just call Icelandair tomorrow and get my tickets changed for another date. I called that evening and their call center closed at like 8 pm CDT. I called the next day, and was told I am out of luck, thank you for your donation basically. Again, I also bought return tickets for end of August and was told those are forfeited also. Altogether it's about 4K. Ok, I am a single parent with two children and this is a lot of money for anyone! I felt lied to by that supervisor at MSP who told me I'd be rebooked and her exact words "you won't have to fight with them". Well, it's been exactly the opposite. I keep calling, I am hung up on, I am put down, talked down to, and plain disrespected. What an awful call center! They make any budget airline or hotel chain look like luxury service. I have been flying over the Atlantic for the past 20+ years pretty regularly and this is the absolute worst. I was lied to and got fake promises, just to get rid of me. They don't sell out every flight, why not allow us to go on a different one if they have seats anyway?! I also was told, by the call center that I should have called them before the flight. Well, they closed 30 min after the plane departed and you have to wait on hold at least an hour to get thru. I was also hung up on that night when I tried. Altogether, what a joke. I thought higher of Iceland prior to this.

### "they do not care"
Icelandair is the worst & they do not care. One in group did not receive their bag. After filling out their forms, we learn the agent never inputted it into their system. The business class seats were poor for sleeping (6 hour flight). We need to change return date. No one at either airport check-in would help. Ask for a manager & told none at the airport (working from home). Tried calling & gave up after 35 minutes on hold (Intl. call). Tried the Apple app & it did not load. Did download the Android app, but when you clicked "Done" it gave an error (but never said what the error was). We ended up buying a second ticket home. No refunds.

### "lack of response from representatives"
Icelandair lost my bag on my flight to BWI this past Saturday, I filed a report at the airport and keep calling customer service daily but up to now my bag has not been located. I have not received any email/notification/call and every time I call, customer service gives me contradicting information saying they're in communication with the airport, saying they cannot reach out to the airport, mentioning flights to me which do not exist that my luggage could be on (it never was) to then saying there has never been any information in the system to confirm anything that has been said to me. One agent in particular refused to update my personal information (my address) and bag descriptors and raised her voice at me. I am on an important business trip which has been completely sabotaged by this and the lack of response from representatives is something I have never experienced. When I asked about refunds for items purchased while my bag remains lost one customer service rep replied "who told you about this? and when I said that it was mentioned to me briefly by her colleague, she asked for the colleague's name before reluctantly said that I could file but that it was up to the airline to decide what they would refund me. I have read the terms and conditions by now but am very negatively surprised by the unprofessionalism in handling my request so far.

### "portion of my luggage was lost by the airline"
Not Verified |  Flying IcelandAir has, honestly, been one of the worst experiences of my life. A significant portion of my luggage was lost by the airline. It has been almost 14 days. I have submitted multiple claims and none of them have been responded to. Staff are rude, refuse to provide policies that they are referencing on my rights as a consumer, and they do not allow for me to raise my complaints with a supervisor. Currently, I am in Greenland on business without the proper clothing and resources to do my trip safely. I have missed out on important meetings and I am virtually confined to my room with the temperatures and IcelandAir's unwillingness to provide compensation that can be used up front for the clothing and gear that I need. IcelandAir is neglectful and they do not respond online, offline, or with sufficient information to keep their passengers safe and supported after they have collected their revenue.

### "They will not refund me"
Buyer beware of purchasing through Icelandair! I recently have been diagnosed with a high risk pregnancy complication and have been instructed by my doctor not to travel. I called Icelandair to figure out my options. They will not refund me, or even let me transfer the ticket to another name on the exact same flight in the exact same seat with no cost to them. Even with a doctor’s note. Do not do business with this shady company.

### "Never flying Icelandair again"
I lost my suitcase on my trip from the US to the Netherlands and never got any compensation, and the luggage was never found. I couldn’t provide the baggage tag because for some reason it wasn’t attached to my ticket, it probably fell somewhere, and that I admit was my fault. I went through the whole process of filing the claim, sending countless pictures of what I had in the luggage, the email exchanges lasted almost a month just so in the end they told me that there won’t be any compensation because there is no proof that I had any luggage with me. It was a 20kg suitcase and worth a lot of money, so I’m really really disappointed. Never flying Icelandair again.

### "Very disappointed with Icelandair"
Very disappointed with Icelandair. I planned a trip to Europe, what would have been my first trip out to the continent. I planned for months and had everything worked out. Then the pandemic happened, the airlines shutting down due to the quarantine. A year later, airlines started opening back up but financially I was struggling because of the pandemic. Now I am trying to plan my trip again and Icelandair will not provide any credit for this trip. Since the cancellation had to do with a global pandemic, definitely not under my control, they want me to fork over another $1600 for a new flight. So now I am looking at over $3000 alone on the ticket by paying again due to horrible customer service. Because of this, I will be looking at flying with another airline, hopefully one that will offer better customer service over something like this if it is not in my wheelhouse of control. I will never recommend this airline and really wish southwest flew to Europe as honestly, they are the only ones with good customer support.

### "Pretty poor service"
IcelandAir sent out an email saying to check in three hours in advance of departure due to airport delays. Given the problems at Dublin Airport (security delays of 5+ hours on May 29), this seemed eminently sensible. Unfortunately, when I showed up 3 hours prior to departure, the check in counter was closed and at least 150 people were waiting to check in. 15 minutes later the line was even longer and still no check in agent. The time to go through security to the gate was about 1 hour, figure 1 to 1-1/2 hrs to go through check in and that the gate closes 15 min before departure. Anyone needing extra time would likely miss their flight. Pretty poor service.

### "if you have medical needs, Icelandair doesn't care"
I need extra legroom due to a damaged knee. To my delight I was allocated to a normal seat next to a window. Staff were completely useless and did nothing to help the cause. Absolutely zero initiative to get the seat changed, didn't even provide instructions on how to reclaim the negligible extra price paid. Only option I was offered was to deboard the flight. 0/10. Be careful if you have medical needs, Icelandair doesn't care.

### "I felt lied to and cheated"
Icelandair says you can change your flight at anytime online, you cannot. I had to call (1 hour wait time), was disconnected multiple times, went on the chat, they refused to admit I couldn't change it on the website and kept trying to send me to the "my journey" page - finally, they admitted you cant change it online and have to call because we had a stopover in Iceland. They say you can change it with no fee, only the change in cost of the ticket price, 30 minutes after I booked (should be able to change your booking 24 hours after you originally book), I tried to change to a later flight: same day, same price - I couldn't do it online and the phoneline wouldn't connect (kept dropping). Magically I missed my 24 hour window where I have to now pay to change it. My family wanted to book the same flight as me, I doomed them to an early flight with my mistake, they called to try and change it since I was disconnected, and the customer service agent tried to sell them a ticket 1000$ higher than what is online, so she had to call. They dont tell you in advance they dont include headphones or food in the cost of the flight and you have to pay once on the airplane. The covid regulations and requirements for your destination is incorrect. In this day and age, everything should be available online to change or edit your see your booking. I have flown internationally with multiple airlines and this is by far the worst experience. Icelandair had terrible customer service in regards to booking or managing your booking. They tried to squeak every dime out of us and their processes set you up to have to pay more. If they were transparent in the process that would be one thing, but they are tricky and deceitful. They lost three customers. If you dont care about the cost of the trip or money and transparency, then they are just fine to fly with. The flight and staff onboard and check in was good, but my ethics refuse to fly with them again after the booking issues and lack of transparency. I felt lied to and cheated. I never would have booked with them if I had known in advance.

### "Will not fly them again"
Flying from London to Seattle with sister. Business class. We each checked 2 bags. We each received 1 in Seattle. The small carry on size ones - the large suitcases - nada. No IcelandAir folks available, their desk was closed. Their report line was closed. Their website useless. Their phones just go to message. In addition - 1 hour delay in London on the tarmac with no air. Will not fly them again.

### "I would not recommend this airline"
I have been waiting for 2 hours at the checking Icelandair counter. Boarding starts at 1:35 pm and now is 11:25 am and nobody is at the counter yet? We still have to check in the luggage and than go through airport security. You can forget about the business lounge, by the time they start to finally work and for you to go through airport security you’ll have to run to catch the plane. Also the past two days I was trying to contact customer service to extend the layover to stay for a day or two in Reykjavik, but every time by the phone or the chat after 1 - 1.5 hour waiting time it just disconnects you. I would not recommend this airline, not even to my enemy. Also don’t bother paying 3x the price for business class, because on Icelandair this is like economy plus at any other normal airline.

### "I'm tired of airlines acting like we owe them something"
Not Verified |  My daughter and I were flying to London from Minneapolis, and had a long layover in Reykjavík. I wanted to see if there was an upgrade available for purchase so I went to the gate desk. The man behind the counter was doing paperwork looking down at his work. I walked up to the desk and stood there for over 5 minutes. He never acknowledged my presence. Finally, I said "Good afternoon sir, I am wondering..." He quickly cut me off and tapped his pen on a sign on their counter that says "Rude customers will be removed. Really? I walked away completely disgusted. If there was anyone who was rude it was clearly him. The flight was cramped like sardines and there was little to no food - even for purchase for this long leg. I decided I would rather paddle a canoe across the Atlantic than fly with Icelandair again. I'm tired of airlines acting like we owe them something. We are the customers and yet it's a common theme (with many airlines) that we are treated like beggars and people who are trying to get something for nothing. I wish the FAA or some regulating agency would step in and make mandates so airlines will quit ripping off customers, cramming them into tiny spaces you can't get out of in an emergency, and treating us like criminals. Yes, there are rude customers - but most people are just trying to get from point A to point B with a paid ticket. No other industry in the world gets away with such treatment of their customers.

### "the worst customer service"
Absolutely the worst customer service and airline operation regarding my experience. I had a booking that was ORD-KEF. Sounds good all is well, then they cancelled the flight. So I call the customer service line no problem, I called got my flight now routed ORD-BOS-KEF and then KEF-JFK-ORD on the way back - few days later I go to my journey page to make sure my seats are all squared away and the system doesn't recognize my itinerary. So I call again to customer service and they claim I took the voucher and they cancelled my flights. Why would I take a voucher when you have all proof of me calling talking to an agent and rerouting my trip. Makes no sense. So now that they won't reinstate my trip, I'm stuck with this voucher that now doesn't even cover the cost of my flights because they increased the prices and I purchased my flight 2 months ago - unbelievable, terrible service. And now I have to pay 550$ extra for the same trip as their agent rerouted me on before they cancelled my itinerary.

### "family members were seated alone"
We waited in the check-in line for 1.5 hours. I have used the same carry-on for six years and this was the first time on any airline that it was too big ($50 fee). All five family members were seated alone (including my nine-year-old).

### "did not pick up our bags in New York"
Icelandair lost, or rather did not pick up our bags in New York City JFK. I know because I spent most of the night on a computer chat room with Jet Blue (their "Partner") trying to find our bags. Icelandair would not answer phones, nor do they have a computer 24 hour chat room. icelandair notified me the next day that they found our bags and would bring them to our hotel in Reykjavik by 10:00am. Our tour group was to leave Reykjavik at 9:00 for the Magma Hotel, 880 Kirkjubaejarklaustur, Iceland to see the northern lights. It was only because of another problem that we were delayed at the Grandi Hotel in Reykjavik that we received our bags. When I spoke with an agent at Icelandair baggage, I was told that if I didn't wait, Icelandair would NOT pay the expense to drive our bags to our next hotel. I find that irresponsible and in-excusable for customer service. Icelandair lost our bags and should have readily driven our bags to where ever we were staying in the country. On our return trip to the USA we were delayed due to a storm. We would have to stay in NYC and catch the next JetBlue flight the next morning. We paid for our bags to be checked through to San Francisco but found, the next morning, that Jet Blue demanded payment for baggage again from NYC to SFO. Icelandair was to put us up at a hotel in New York City for the night. When we arrived to the hotel at 11:30 (after an all day travel) the Crown Plaza Hotel said that Icelandair refused to pay them and to go back to the airport. There were other passengers from the same flight trying to get rooms as well. We just paid the hotel and will now have to deal with Icelandair to get a refund. Wish us luck. They are not ones to take blame lightly and between them and Jet Blue, I have never seen so much finger pointing and laying blame on one another instead of rectifying the situation.

### "most robotic unhelpful rude people"
Not Verified |  Absolutely insane to force people to travel (or rebook at a higher fare) when all they need to do is offer a credit. Not looking for a refund mind you, Iceland on the Do Not Travel list, a new variant out there and they want you to rebook- not knowing when it will be safe. So you spend $500 and still may need to rebook again -for another $500? They decided after a certain date they would not offer a refund - didn’t mention a credit, and now the situation is even worse than before and they want to be hardheaded. Pay the extra money and fly a real airline. Their customer service people are the most robotic unhelpful rude people I’ve ever dealt with. Just as an added bonus for dealing with Icelandair. I didn’t fly with them so ignore the ratings for cabin and seat below.

### "discourage anyone from booking with them"
Not Verified |  Booked a 5 tickets with Icelandair in Denver, Colorado last Sunday. I paid $35 a seat each way for all five members of in my party. We realized that we had booked the wrong row for two of the members of our flight and have been trying to upgrade. I have been told that I will need to pay the full $80 per person each way to upgrade to the row in front of the other three passengers and they will keep my $35 per person each way. Just for reference that's a total of $460 for a seat on the airplane. Just for further reference that's equivalent to a one way ticket. We have never flown with Icelandair, never will again, and would strongly discourage anyone from booking with them.

### "Flight was unsatisfactory in several ways"
Flight 664 from Portland Oregon was unsatisfactory in several ways. My seat could not recline. The attendant tried it and said it was broken. Same with the foot rest. The food was unpalatable, a few hard, overcooked shrimps, and an entree of a few strips of dry turkey breast on a mountain of greens. Just awful. I asked for the turkey wrap served in coach. Flight 671 from Reykjavik was an improvement. Seat reclined, food was very good. Entertainment on both flights was unsatisfactory. Very limited selection. I tried to contact Icelandair via email sent to a name on their website but it came back as undeliverable. I won’t choose Icelandair again.

### "If you paid they should provide the food"
Not Verified |  No food or drink expected for an international flight, they said because of covid. This is ridiculous people not eating or drinking for hours. If you paid they should provide the food. Awful Entertainment. No many movies or music to select from. I don't recommend it at all. No breakfast, no wipes for your face after sleeping before arriving. I will never fly on this airline again and I don't recommend it.

### "very bad to no customer service"
Before our flight on Sept. 21, 2021 we checked in online, and since we were Transit passengers in Reykjavik, we did not pre-register, because as per Icelandair E-mail of Sept. 18, 2021 to us: "If you are on a transiting flight via Iceland, without leaving the airport in Keflavik, you do not need to pre-register". Both of were also fully vaccinated and had negative Covid-19 test results. When we arrived at the Portland airport for check-in, a representative of Icelandair stopped and prevented us to even get to the check-in counter because he demanded a pre-registration Code from us. Even though we showed him that according to the E-mail from Icelandair, we did not need to pre-register, he still refused to let us go to the check-in counter and would not help us in any way. Had it not been for a Portland airport employee who helped us with entering detailed information in our Smartphones, we would have missed our flights. This procedure took over one hour and left us terribly frustrated at the beginning of our international flight. Based on this as well as our in-flight and Keflavik airport experiences we can only rate Icelandair as having very bad to no customer service.

### "refuses to reimburse us"
Not Verified |  Do not fly with Icelandair. My wife and I upgraded our seats online so that we could have extra legroom (I'm 6'4", mostly leg). Moments later, when we realized that the upgrades were for seats that wouldn't recline, we decided to see if we could switch them to ones that do recline. The online system made it very easy, but we were charged for both upgrades. The company now refuses to reimburse us for the nearly $300 for the original upgrade for the seats we won't be sitting in. Disgraceful!

### "I will never fly Icelandair again"
On our return flight from London, we laid over in at Keflavik Airport. We learned when we arrived that we could not return to our departure airport, Newark. Instead we were diverted to New York and had to find our own way back to our car, before our 3 hour drive home. The Airline has agreed to reimburse our UBER fee since they created a disturbance in our travel plans. However, while on the flight to New York, seated in row 2 of first class, a couple in front of us had a small and very old dog. About an hour before landing, the woman was telling the man to hurry and get up because the dog had to pee. She then carried to dog to the service area and told the flight attendant the problem. The attendant gave the woman an extra blanket. The woman returned to the seat, put the blanket on the seat-put the dog on the seat until it relieved itself! Then she returned to blanket to the flight attendant. The blanket was not waterproof or absorbent enough to keep the urine from running down the seat to the floor where, of course, my personal bag was stored. When I retrieved it , my purse was covered with dog urine and half the contents were also wet. I advised the attendant on my way out and she simply said, “Oh, that’s not good.” That’s it. The smell was awful and I had to carry that bag without any offer to help clean it or bag it…nothing. I will never fly Icelandair again given this wholly unacceptable animal policy. I have no problem with small animals traveling in the cabin as long as there are proper and sanitary provisions for their normal bodily functions. The flights were otherwise clean and comfortable and staff was attentive. WiFI stinks.

### "terrible treatment of a customer"
Not Verified |  I have flown Icelandair numerous times in the past, it’s been my preferred travel route to Europe. I’ve always had a good experience, until recently. I am so incredibly disappointed in the poor customer service my boyfriend and I have received recently. I booked a trip to Europe to visit friends and naturally, I booked with Icelandair. My boyfriend decided he wanted to fly out to join us a few days into my trip. Per my recommendation, we booked him with Icelandair. During the time of booking, there was no travel restrictions for American tourists traveling to the Netherlands (our destination). For layovers in the KEF airport, it was required for American tourists to provide a negative COVID test OR a proof of vaccination. My boyfriend was scheduled to depart our local airport on September 5th. On September 4th the travel restrictions were altered and suddenly both a negative test and proof of vaccination was required. When my boyfriend arrived at the airport, he was denied boarding onto his plane. He is not vaccinated, but was able to provide the negative test. This was no longer sufficient. This caused numerous issues and loss of funds for both of us, throughout my entire trip. When we contacted customer service regarding the refund, we were told that he would not be issued one! I am just besides myself at the unwillingness to help us due to the circumstances. This is completely ridiculous. Not only was this of no fault of ours, we also purchased the Travel Protection Plan! We were still told that he has been listed as a “No Show” and our situation doesn’t fit into the policy for any of the refund guidelines. I understand that times are strange, and restrictions change almost daily (why we purchased the protection plan). I can’t believe this company is profiting off of passengers who have already been inconvenienced tremendously, at no fault of their own. We are being forced to pay for a series of flights that were never taken, refused a refund for the because of what? The airline wasn’t inconvenienced at all. The airline lost no money by him not being on the flight. This is terrible business, extremely unethical and terrible treatment of a customer. I will never fly Icelandair ever again. I will make sure no one in my family, my friends, or anyone in my industry flies with Icelandair again.

### "we had two negative experiences"
Not Verified |  Our flight from Boston was OK, but we had two negative experiences with Icelandair. The airport in Reykjavík was overcrowded and there was zero effort to keep people socially distanced although there was room to do so. Our second issues was their association with Global rental car, which we booked on their website. The company, as it turns out, has terrible reviews and justifiably so. Global rental car requires a deposit to rent a vehicle and buried in the fine print, you do not get back the deposit no matter how soon you cancel (in our case, three months in advance and only days after booking the rental). We canceled due to the awfully negative reviews. There was no phone number to call and when you click on the cancellation button, you have no choice but to agree to an additional fee. No other Iceland rental car company that we found wanted a deposit. Icelandair should vet the vendors that they choose to place on their website.

### "no food for cross Atlantic flights"
The staff at Heathrow airport check-in take forever. They try to deal with customers problems like they are a airline help desk/assistance office instead of checking in passengers. Therefore what should be a relatively quick process through check-in takes between 30-60 minutes. In addition they provide no food for cross Atlantic flights. It is insane to think they expect passengers to go 8 hours without any food.

### "Flight delayed 3 hrs due to a faulty plane"
Contradictory info re. Covid on the website and in practice. Flight delayed 3 hrs due to a faulty plane. We got the message about the delay when we were already at the airport. No meal vouchers.

### "not allowed to board my flight"
I was not allowed to board my flight due to insufficient information provided by Icelandair for my final destination restrictions. Even though I could not board a plane, Icelandair was still able to lose my luggage. I drove (2) 2 hour round trips to the airport (total of 4 hours), waited over 10 hours at the airport, inconvenienced others, accrued Uber fees, called customer service 4 times and still have not received one call back from their company with an update on my lost luggage. My entire trip was canceled, luggage lost, and two days of my vacation was spent at the airport looking for my bag and anyone who could help me.

### "not going to refund any money"
I was to fly to meet my family, who were in need, after not having been able to see them due to COVID-19 restrictions and lockdown. Icelandair proved to be the worst choice I may have ever made while travelling. My route was from CPH to JFK, with a stopover at KEF. There was no mention of the visa or the entry restrictions due to COVID-19, besides the need for proof of a negative test of not more than 72 hours. I had my certificates of vaccination, a negative quick test and a PCR test of less than 24 hours before boarding my flight from CPH. While checking in at CPH, I was told that my baggage would be checked all the way through to JFK, whilst I would have to get a second boarding card - from KEF to JFK - at the service desk at Keflavik. My visa to the US was checked thrice and was still issued a go ahead. On landing at Keflavik, I went to the service desk where an Icelandair representative appeared after a good 20 mins of wait at an empty desk. He checked my visa and said that I could not board the flight as the visa was not acceptable by the US CBP (Customs and Border Patrol). When asked as to how this could possibly be the case while I have travelled up to Iceland to go up to JFK, he clearly stated that "We made a mistake" at the CPH airport. They should not have allowed you to travel at all, in the first place". When I insisted that this was for a family need, he told me that the visa waiver was not applicable and Icelandair was not responsible, and that he would book me a flight back to CPH for the following day. I was left frustrated, distraught and helpless. When asked where I was supposed to stay, he threw his hands up in the air and said that he was not the person to speak to and that I should contact the Customer Service desk. I asked where I could find them, and he says - and I quote- "They are closed now". HOW can this be an airline that is still allowed to fleece customers off and operate like a banana republic of airlines? There seem to be no consequence or accountability on the part of Icelandair. The communication was terrible and useless and the customer care desk, which is a joke, came back in the form of an automated email stating that Icelandair is not going to refund any money on the tickets booked as it was up to me - the customer. As for the review - the one star is only because I cannot award no stars, otherwise this airline deserves to serve as a cautionary tale and there's nothing star-like about it.

### "Very bad experience"
Very bad experience with Icelandair. The staff behind the desk doesn’t know exactly which paperwork they need in this corona times. The refused to let us to be board on the plane. Discriminating my Wife because she was allowed to fly, however they refused and wanted every time more paperwork and find something not to board them. At the last they don’t want to refund anything and put the blame on the customers.

### "transatlantic avoid them"
This was our second Icelandair go and back flight. Since their fleet of Boeing 767 and 757 is getting old and worn out they had to find a replacement, and, obviously not being willing to change to Airbus, the only option they had was the ill-fated 737Max, which still needs to regain its reputation. The last grounding was in April, but now Icelandair claims everything is under control. This plane is just new but not more advanced inside or more comfortable than their old planes. Seats are leather and about the same comfort as we had many years ago on old 737s, with not much recline. The galleys are tiny, and so is the room for the toilet cubicles. The first row in Economy is with more legroom, but you pay extra. Noise level is not better than in old planes. The TV screens in that first row are lowered into a pocket between the seats, and the crew has to help everybody to retrieve them and pull them up. The food service is typical Icelandair, just minimal. We flew Saga class last time, and it was the same. Advice: do not fly Saga class, the price difference is too much. Bring your own food. Cabin attendants were friendly but not extremely keen on making you feel comfortable. If you need something you have to tell them. Pilots only announced the bare minimum they are required to. Ground service provided by agent at Zurich was excellent as always, but at Keflavik it was low quality. On-time performance was good, but easy to achieve in low Corona passenger numbers. Fly Icelandair if you go to Iceland, but transatlantic avoid them, the change of planes in KEF is an ordeal.

### "The money was never returned"
We purchased tickets via a Discover credit card to fly Denver-Reychevik-Stockholm for 7/1/20 with a return trip 2 weeks later from Helsinki on 7/16/20. With the pandemic, the flight did not occur, and Icelandair would not answer their phone or e-mail. This continues through today. The money for the business class tickets was never returned. In essence Icelandair has stolen several thousand dollars from us by keeping our money for a trip that never happened. We have notified the state attorney general about this, but unfortunately settling such matters thru the courts is a long and arduous process. As such we can only notify other potential customers about such deceptive and unethical practices.

### "Icelandair was very disingenuous with me"
My wife and I was supposed to fly in September 2020 for my 70th birthday to Ireland and Scotland. We all know what occurred starting in March 2020. Covid-19. Due to health and safety issues I continually checked to see if Icelandair was going to cancel our flights. It seemed to me that Icelandair was playing chicken with our flights so that instead of letting me know that they were cancelling the flights and that I could get a refund, they kept me in the dark as to the status of our flights thereby forcing me to cancel my flight and take a travel voucher instead or potentially losing $1600.00+ dollars. I am also aware that I was not the only traveler to experience this problem. So I got a travel voucher only to find out later, when speaking to an Icelandair representative that my flights had been cancelled. So to put it succinctly, Icelandair was very disingenuous with me. I should have received information that Icelandair had cancelled my flights and I should have received a refund. Now they refuse to give me a refund because I got a travel voucher. Another way to look at this is that, at the expense of the traveler, Icelandair keeps your money to keep them afloat. Simply horrible.

### "one of the best flight experiences I've had"
I just flew with Iceland air from Copenhagen to Reykjavik yesterday, and I feel the need to support this company. I found a flight with them to Iceland for around 70 Euros, which is pretty cheep for a flight to Iceland. Included was a travel suitcase and a personal item, so no extra money spent. As soon as I came on board I was given a water bottle and a sealed bag with a mask and cleaning items. In addition I could pick a free beverage, soft drink or tea/coffee, 30 min into the flight (children were also given free meals boxes). The seat was comfy, could be reclined and the space greater than what I have grow accustomed to when flying, and they have a TV screen in front of every seat, full of entertainment and flight information. But what really made it for me was the positive attitude and friendliness of the staff on board. It can't be easy to do this job in the middle of a pandemic, but they were always willing to assist with a smile on their face. Honestly one of the best flight experiences I've had. P.S. We flew right past the volcano, it was really cool to see the tongues of fire coming from the ground, and how the lava is slowly filling up the valley.

### "I couldn't have wished for any better treatment"
Not Verified |  I've been flying with Icelandair numerous times during this pandemic, which I understand is a very hard time for the business. I've always been treated very good and now during my latest flight I wasn't able to go with my original flight through Copenhagen which would have led me to have to reschedule my flight to another day. Instead the staff at Icelandair fixed for me so I could go to Sweden through Amsterdam. Previously they've had excellent service when flights have been cancelled. I've been able to reschedule to other flights that should have been more expensive, without paying the difference. I couldn't have wished for any better treatment and am so happy that this is a company I trusted to help me when flying between Sweden and Iceland. Will definitely always use this company when traveling to Iceland (and somewhere else if possible). I lived in Iceland but I'm Swedish, that's why I had to travel between the country even though the pandemic.

### "refused to provide a refund"
I was supposed to go to Sweden in July of 2020 but the trip was cancelled as a result of the COVID19 Pandemic. In the weeks/months leading up to the trip, their customer hotline was busy and I was told that they were only addressing travel in the next 48 hours. Later, in their email notifying us of the cancellation, there was a clear "Click here for a Travel Voucher". After completing this, I later found a link for a credit refund (buried somewhere on their website). I submitted a refund request. Shortly afterwards, they issued a travel voucher but refused to provide a refund. When I called to get the travel voucher exchanged for a refund, I was told that it was impossible because I had submitted a travel voucher first! Obviously the pandemic upended travel plans everywhere for everyone and I find it inconceivable that they would only issue a travel voucher.

### "would not fly Icelandair ever again"
Not Verified | If I had any other option - I would not fly Icelandair ever again. In March they cancelled my flight from Gatwick to Keflavik less than a week before the fly date, rebooked me on another flight which was then cancelled again 3 days before the departure even after I contacted their customer service to make sure that it will not be cancelled (they told me that it will 100% not be cancelled cause they're trying to bring all the natives home because of Covid - I'm Icelandic so was reassured by this which was a huge mistake). I ended up buying a last minute flight with EasyJet to get home to my family. So overall it cost me between £1k-£1.5k with the many train tickets I had to buy cause they kept cancelling and the last minute flight. Didn't get my refund until September and that was after I contacted the CEO directly. During summer and easter I kept calling their customer service which just told me that I'm in a queue to get a refund (complete bollocks since people who got their flights cancelled in July/August were getting their refunds while I was still waiting from March!). Now, I need to get back to the UK since my university is starting again, Icelandair is the only airline flying between UK and Iceland that doesn't have any connections in different countries right now so I had no chocie to book with them again. My flight was supposed to be this Saturday and I just received an email from them that it was cancelled - 2 days before departure. They rebooked me for Sunday but I wouldn't be surprised at all if I got an email from them tomorrow or on Sat that, that flight will be cancelled as well. Not to mention, I already booked the train tickets and the hotel for Saturday and changing that to Sunday cost me yet again a lot of money and I had to call my student accommodation and let them now of the change in plans as well. If you have any other option then Icelandair, even if it's more expensive, choose it.

### " the seating wasn't bad for coach"
Not Verified | I had the foresight to fly back home cheaply before borders were shut in some countries. Boeing 757's are hardly spacious but the seating wasn't bad for coach in a narrow body.The cabin was immaculate, it had that new plane smell. Crew polite and efficient, if a little reserved compared to other nationalities. I don't expect to be pampered on a low cost airline. Buy on board menu was ok, fairly priced for a European airline.

### "only two passengers on the flight"
Not Verified | Reykjavik to Boston during the COVID19 shutdown. There were only two passengers on the flight. When boarding we were told there was water and a snack on our seat. I was able to stretch out for the five hour flight. It was difficult times and the airline did well.

### "cancelled without me being notified"
On June 27 I flew from Sacramento CA to Seattle to take Icelandair flight 680 to Iceland only to find out that the flight had been cancelled without me being notified. No flights back the same day so I had to rent a car to drive back to Sacramento, about 14 hours. Vacation gone so no way of even contacting the airline. Customer number just a recording pointing you to one place or the other on their website. Icelandair is is the most dishonest company I have ever done business with.

### "I need my money back"
I bought a ticket on business class through Edreams company, with Icelandair to travel to Geneva, through Iceland capital on 31 May 2020. But some days before the flight I received a cancellation notice of the flight from Icelandair, while I cancelled my accommodation lease for that date in New York, trusting the company Icelandair and thinking that I will be travelling on that date, which caused me a lot of trouble after, because I couldn’t travel on the 31st of May. And I am blocked now in New York, because of Icelandair and Edreams. Icelandair with the help of some companies like Edreams are selling tickets of flights that they know will not be fulfilled in order to keep the money of the travelers, this is a scam and theft, and not a legit business. Then after many unanswered calls, I submitted a request for a refund, but didn't even receive a reply from them till now, I wonder now, are they a valid company or a scam company taking the money of naïve people like me. I don't want a voucher I need my money back to buy a new ticket to travel to Geneva.

### "letting you down last minute"
Cancelled flights last minute, not respecting their own 7 days cancellation policy. did not even bother to answer my calls / mails. Poor customer handling, and about as bad business sense. They let you book flights they know will not fly and then do not care at all about letting you down last minute. Not even able to contact them.

### "by far the worst I've dealt with"
Not Verified |  Global pandemics throw everyone into chaos but just getting an update from anyone at this airline is disastrous. Having flown with them on a previous trip I had no problems booking the tickets months in advance, but once they decided to cancel almost all their flights that's when the radio silence happened. They sent 1 e-mail to inform me of the cancellation, but after I submitted form for the refund there was nothing from an actual human being. 3 follow-up e-mails trying to entice me into taking a travel voucher but not one response about their form. Phone calls, e-mails and follow-up forms were submitted to no avail. Having dealt with other cancellations during this pandemic, this is by far the worst I've dealt with so far. I finally broke down and filed the complaint with the DOT and disputed the charge with my credit card. Never again Icelandair! Just not worth the trouble.

### "not be booking with them again"
Not Verified |  I am currently extremely frustrated with the process in which this airline is handling this pandemic. As many working Americans we plan our flights around what little time we have available. This pandemic has created absolute uncertainty with any and all previously made plans. However, when I spoke to customer service representatives (yes plural because no one could give me an answer), I was told that the airlines policy is credit until the end of the year. Seems simple enough if you are fortunate enough to take time from your occupation and other responsibilities at the drop of a hat. The trip my husband and I had planned was a years worth of planning and coordinating housing and other activities we wanted to enjoy on our honeymoon. Many of these were difficult to reschedule for the next year, let alone by the end of the year. I am incredibly frustrated and disappointed in their lack of willingness to work with frequent fliers all because of policy. Will not be booking with them again.

### "told that policy is policy"
After an extremely frustrating conversation, that may have well been with an automated system that you continuously repeat “speak to a representative” to no avail, except this was with a human robot who could only speak protocol, I have managed my anger and am now able to articulate my disgust with this airline with control. Currently we are all experiencing a global pandemic, of great magnitude. Most of us have been out of work, without sustainable income for several weeks, with no promise of our current situation Seeing positive change in the foreseeable future. This is having a devastating effect on, not only, our economy, but the majority of our personal lives and livelihood. This should go without saying. We are doing what he have no choice to do, hopefully, you are able to keep yourselves and your families alive, with food In your bellies and roofs over your heads. We will get through this one way or another. As for travel, Denver Colorado, which is where I currently reside, has just declared lockdown/social distancing until at least the first of may. Denver international airport has posted on their website that there will be NO international travel for the entire month of April, however, Icelandair is not following suit with cancelling, or changing, or refunding these flights until 24 hours prior to scheduled travel. Pandemic considered, obviously, “ I understand your frustrations, ma’am, but it is not our policy to issue refunds” is the best they can do when the first country to be hit by this virus, is still not recovered. I was told that policy is policy, that who ever I was speaking with did not have a supervisor.

### "offer horrible customer service"
I was scheduled to fly out to Reykjavík from JFK/ New York City on 3/13/20. The president of the United States had issued a travel ban to Europe including Iceland during that time. When I contacted the Airline/travel agency they told me that my IcelandAir had not instituted a travel ban against the USA. So it was irrelevant to them and not their concern regarding my re-entry into the USA. Rather they tried to convince me it was completely safe to travel with to Iceland and their COVID19 cases were having a minimal impact on tourist activities. I choose not to make that flight and later called to reschedule the next story they told me was I would have to reschedule my flight by October 2020. I told them this was not possible as the local tour group I was traveling with rescheduled our trip for next year 3/21. Again they were dismissive and said they could not help me. A couple weeks later I tried reaching IcelandAir again. This time they were not talking phone calls or email messages. Instead they said contact them through social media, like Facebook messenger. I sent a message through Facebook messenger and it was ignored for roughly a week. They then said restrictions were now that I had to complete my travel by January 1, 2021. Again I told them my Iceland tour agency rescheduled my trip a year out to March 2021. So the airline refused to help again. This past week I finally got a response to an email I had sent them some time ago. They said contact my tour/flight agency as they can not help me but I may now travel after January 2021 if I pay a rescheduling fee. Today I contacted that agency and they told me IcelandAir had suspended my tickets and they can no longer change or give me any sort of credit. I told the agency I just emailed with IcelandAir this week about rescheduling why would they now suspend my tickets. The agency said we cannot help you. You have to negotiate with IcelandAir. So I immediately called IcelandAir back only to get a message saying they are busy and cannot take my call. The call was then disconnected. I understand that COVID19 has placed IcelandAir under financial distress but my treatment has come across as if they are playing games and disregarding the safety of their customers. It seems extremely dishonest. Every time you do actually get through they have yet another reason why you are not qualified for rescheduling or credit. I would strongly encourage future fliers not to travel with this carrier. They are dishonest, uncaring, and offer horrible customer service.

### "why doesn’t common sense prevail?"
Manchester to Orlando via Keflavik. All flights cancelled. Not allowed to visit USA ESTA cancelled by homeland security. Been told I can be put on the next available flight or a credit note. I was visiting the USA fo 4 weeks as a once in a life time trip for my wife and I for our retirement. 45 years working that has now gone to pot and we just want a refund - what is so difficult about that? Stop hiding behind keyboards and do the decent thing return ours and many others hard earned cash. Theirs a pandemic going on in the world - why doesn’t common sense prevail?

### "poor service and no integrity"
Not Verified |  My flight to Europe was scheduled for March 13th. Due to the upcoming coronavirus ban, I wished to cancel. After endlessly calling, I got through one day in advance of the flight and was told I had to choose a date before the flight for Sept 1 or earlier and pay the difference. There were no flights without additional expense, so I sent a message, per their post about upcoming flights, to ask for a credit to allow a little time to plan. I received the response on March 15th saying I could reschedule my flight through Dec 31st. When I called to schedule, they rejected me and said my ticket was already suspended even though I received the message March 15th and sent mine before the flight. I had also sent a letter to their president Bogi, and he said under no circumstances were they making exceptions to ticket rules. I have lost $1500 because they wouldn't provide a credit voucher to allow me to plan another flight. Every other airline allowed that. I have spent about six hours on hold and in conversation to no avail. While I was speaking with one Icelandair clerk and asked for the spelling of her name, she said it wasn't her problem if I didn't know phonetics. Icelandair has poor service and no integrity.

### "inadequate services for the elderly"
New York JFK to Keflavik. Icelandair Coming out of a small airport with inadequate services for the elderly (key escalator was not working), apparently to punish folks with carryon luggage by forcing them to walk briskly down an unsafe stairwell, with said luggage to the designated gate. Relatively small long narrow walkways with times posted as high as 30 minutes to walk to a particular gate. No electric walkways for. If you’re elderly, you’re screwed! Then you get to the gate and talk to the Icelandair “gatekeeper” who is busy typing in stuff on the computer. You tell her that, “I’m going to need extra time walking into the plane because of my back. Can I board early? Yes, you’ll be called early.” I was never called and the line started to move. I went to the head of the line, much to this dismay of the lined up super customers, and asked a new attendant about boarding early. The attendant looked shocked and seemed not know what I was talking about. I asked again and finally the question began about buying stuff or carrying something for someone started. I got on another line and there was no such thing as “early boarding for the handicapped.” And when they say, before landing, “return your seat in their upright position, you can ignore it. On two Icelandair flights I observed that they failed to correct many passenger “upright seat indiscretions.” Then there’s the free snacks, which don’t exist. You’re lucky if the coffee is fresh. With only profit in mind, IcelandAir failed in quality and took away your space so they can cram as many  in less square footage as possible.

### "in-flight service was awful"
Boston to Reykjavik. This airline is unprofessional, disorganized, and delivers poor service. Our flight was canceled for bad weather, and when they rebooked us we were given much worse seats and never given the option to select a new flight or new seats - we were just thrown in at their whim. The in-flight service was awful. The flight attendants are unresponsive and do not seem to care about assisting passengers. They do not respond to customer complaints in a reasonable time frame and they do not compensate you if you’re downgraded or their flight is terrible.

### "thank you to the staff"
Not Verified |  Glasgow to Keflavík. This is one of the best airlines I have travelled. The seats were comfy and everyone had their own TV to choose what they would like to watch. They also provided complimentary soft drinks, pillows and blankets. The staff were lovely and very approachable, huge thank you to the staff on the flights there and back.

### "worst airline I have flown"
Not Verified |  Boston to Keflavik. This has to be by far the worst airline I have flown. The staff are  unprofessional and very snobby to me.bI was sitting in the row and a lady was trying to find somewhere to put her luggage and the staff yelled at her to hurry up. Coming from the Keflavík airport the staff are also unprofessional plane ran late. Fast forward, getting to the Boston Logan airport, I was late to baggage claim due to leaving something behind on the plane. Icelandair would not give me my luggage. There was no one at the Logan airport from Icelandair after calling customer service and staying in the airport for 3 hours they finally gave me my luggage I will never ever ever fly with this airline again.

### "pleased with the flights"
Not Verified |  Vancouver to London via Keflavik. The flight was at the gate ahead of schedule and had mostly boarded when I got on 35 mins before take off. The seat was good and there was a touch screen and power. Wifi was for a fee. I didn't use it. The staff were lovely. Service was frequent and they were happy to fill your empty water bottle and you could go to the back for coffee. They have a range of local gins to try and the tonic is free. The flight arrived early. On the way home we got out ahead of a storm. The pilot explained the reason for delay. The layover was then just a change in planes. Same level of service. The flight got in an hour ahead of the time on the booking. I was pleased with the flights. The only thing I would say is that they do not encourage passengers to raise their seat back at meal service - I just also reclined mine. If you are a recliner this is a plus, if you are not it's a minus.

### "product is well behind the times"
Copenhagen to Keflavík in Saga Class, which is Icelandair's business class. Due to weather in Iceland, out flight was delayed 24 hours. Icelandair rebooked us automatically for the following day. The inflight experience was pleasant. Icelandair's hard product is well behind the times but for a 3 hours flight it wasn't an issue. Service was warm and efficient. Icelandair's problem has been its lack of attention to Saga Class customers who pay a premium expecting a superior overall experience. We were bused to the aircraft in cold weather with the rest of the passengers both while boarding in CPH and upon arrival in KEF. No special consideration whatsoever outside the aircraft for Business Class passengers.

### "very poor at managing delays"
Never ever fly with Iceland (Keflavik) as transit airport! The weather is unpredictable and there are few if any alternative flight if you miss your connection. We had to stay over night in Iceland on the way to the US and was delayed 9 hours (rerouted with a non-direct flight since Icelandair did not hold their only direct flight this day to Stockholm for like 15 minutes). Icelandair also is very poor at managing delays. Passengers receive poor or no information on the plane and must instead queue at a service desk with all other delayed passengers. On the way to the US Icelandair provided a hotel but I did not get there until 3 am and could just sleep a few hours. Icelandair also charges far to much for extra leg room seats compared to other airlines, do not provide free WiFi on board and do not provide vouchers of sufficient value for meals when delays occur. I will probably never fly with this company again if it can be avoided.

### "have never been so annoyed at an airline"
Not Verified |  I have never been so annoyed at an airline. When I got into Reykjavík from Denver we had to wait on the plane for 45 mins before being allowed to deplane. I had a connection to Manchester a couple of hours later. I boarded the plane the normal time and then proceeded to sit on the plane for 3 and a half hours without taking off. Apart from all the problems with delays, they serve absolutely nothing for free. You will pay for drinks, meals, snacks. I will never fly with Icelandair again.

### "never fly with this company again"
Oslo to Washington via Keflavik. Worst airline in the history of airline travel. The customer service is very disappointing. If you want any type of refreshments you need to buy it. You are lucky if you can get water for free. I bought my seat because I did not want to sit in the rear but on my way back home, my seat was changed without even asking me. I was given the seat by the bathroom and had to put up with the door constantly opening and closing in my face and smell the bathroom aroma. When I emailed Icelandair, they claimed that the aircraft was changed and the reassigned the seat with more legroom. How did they know that I chose my seat based on legroom? As a mater of fact I did not. I chose it because it was close enough to the front of the plane. I would never fly with this company again and based on my experience, I would advise everyone to consider someone else

### "bad customer service"
I bought a ticket through the Icelandair website from Vancouver to Zurich with a stop over in Iceland on the way home. I had to buy this as two individual tickets. This is not what I wanted as I wanted it to be one ticket. However, the Icelandair website did not allow me to book it as one trip. I thought that might be a system error so I called to see if an Icelandair representative could fix this for me as. However the representative instructed me that they can't do it either and that I should buy two individual tickets to make this trip happen. We bought the economic standard ticket that allows changes for a fee. Once we realized that we can't fly on the dates planned we called to change the tickets, which is when we were informed that we have to pay the change fee of 300$ CAD twice since it's two reservations, eventhough it was one trip. Obviously that made no sense as paying $600 plus fare difference was not worthwhile compared to the original ticket. Interestingly enough, the price that I was told to change the ticket through the representative was $800, compared to $500, when I did it myself online. The difference couldn't be explained to me. While trying to change the dates, I said that I would like to upgrade to the more expensive ticket category that would allow for changes without a fee, I was told that I could upgrade and pay more but that the policy of the old ticket class would carry over. Hence not really helpful either. Eventually I decided to cancel the ticket. I was told that I would get parts of the taxes reimbursed. Once I asked how much that would be, they said that they can't tell me. In the end I asked if there is a complaints department or a escalations department. Guess what, the answer was no. Unfortunately, bad customer service. I can't comment on the actual airline as we didn't end up flying with them, and never will after this experience.

### "worst experience on a flight"
Not Verified |  The worst experience on a flight ever! I never have problems with any kind of budget airline, but Icelandair is just ridiculous and should take a very close look to their customer service in my opinion. On my flight from Amsterdam to New York, with a stop in Reykjavik, I only had hand luggage with me. In Amsterdam they said the luggage was correct for a carry on and so I went on the flight. On the flight itself my screen didn’t work, but they didn’t allow me to change seats even though there were free seats in the economy class I was in. I let it go, but was not able to watch a movie or anything, even though there would have been an easy solution for this. After the first flight, the worst part happened: in Reykjavik they told me shortly before we would take off, that my carry on was too big and that I had to pay 100 euros to be able to take it with me. When I said I thought this was very strange because they checked it in Amsterdam already, they treated my like I was stupid and even cursed at me. I went on the flight in a shock and even the crew on board was in shock with me and told me to complain. So I did. Still have not been given a decent answer in months. I have called with the customer service over 20 times, they told me that they could see in the system that I would get a refund, but could not tell me more information about this; if I wanted more information, I should email the complaint department. I have emailed the complaint department and have yet not received any answers on my question from them. The only thing they sent (after two months) was a very standard email with not any answer on the specific questions I asked. I will never in my life fly with this airline again and will highly recommend others to not do this either. It is one big disappointment and I feel very disrespected as a human and a paying customer. Besides: WiFi does not work, no food or drink on the plane, you need to buy your headphones etc.

### "seats are way behind the times"
Keflavík to Copenhagen in Saga Class. Icelandair's fleet of 757 is now old and the Saga Class seats are way behind the times. While Icelandair's Saga Class product will win no awards, for short flights to and from Iceland and Europe it is a comfortable enough experience. Icelandair has a good on-time record. The wifi included with your Saga Class ticket is a nice touch.

### "be careful using IcelandAir "
Not Verified |  On our way home from England, they had booked us a connecting flight through Montreal. They must not have considered the fact that we had to clear customs in Montreal, as we ran to Porter to catch our flight to Halifax and they said we did not have time to make it. There was no agent at the airport for Icelandair, which seems ridiculous as they just had a flight arrive. From there we proceeded to call Icelandair to let them know we needed to rebook as they booked our flights too close together. They did. We then proceeded to ask them if we would be able to book a hotel room as we couldn’t get a flight until the next morning. Between the 4 of us, there were 3 reservations and they told us we would qualify for 3 rooms, 1 for each reservation. We only booked 2, one for mom and dad and one for me . They said we had to pay for the room up front, then put the claim through their website afterwards to be reimbursed for them. Now they will not pay. They initially argued that the flight to Halifax was 3 hours late leaving and we had time to catch it. But they were looking at the arrival time, not the departure time. They agreed that was a mistake, but that we still had time to catch the flight. They have said we need to take it up with Porter that they didn’t let us on the flight. Why did their representative tell us we qualified for 3 rooms and now not pay for it? Had they said so at the time, we would have camped out in the airport, or at the very least, shared a room between the 4 of us. My mother has had numerous correspondence with IcelandAir. She said she is not going to let this go and their response was the following: “further request for a different resolution of this case will unfortunately at this time result in the closure of this case without further reply”. It’s bad enough they will not pay, but to have led us to believe they would, causing us to incur the costs. This is the most recent issue we have had, and one in many issues we had travelling with IcelandAir last August. My family and I feel bullied, and left to feel like there is nothing we can do and have to just suck it up. Well, maybe we’re are not going to get the money back from them, and that’s fine, but I don’t want to go away quietly and want to speak up. Please be careful using IcelandAir for your travelling needs. Their customer service and ethics are “less than desired” and you may incur some additional expenses.

### "absolutely recommend"
Stockholm to Keflavik. I have flown with Icelandair once a year for almost 20 years and never had a bad experience. I have only experienced three major delays, one was because of a storm. The staff is friendly and accommodating. I don’t eat the food anymore as it’s expensive and not that great but my flight is short enough to manage. I absolutely recommend Icelandair!

### "Icelandair Cost Me!"
Icelandair Cost Me! Very poor customer service! I flew Icelandair in September because I wanted to try the new airline. I was heading to Edinburgh, but they only flew to London so I booked a separate flight on British Airways from London to Edinburgh. I left plenty of time between flights, to ensure I could make the transfer. However, when I got to Reyjavik for the layover, I was told my next flight was delayed 2 hours! I was pretty sure since I had to change terminals at Heathrow I would miss my flight (in the end the plane left Reyjavik 3 hours late!) I went to the customer service desk and advised of my dilemma and asked what they would do for me. They said nothing, it was my problem! How does their delay end up being my fault?! I was on the telephone trying to change flights with British Airways, and they were great! But, I had to pay an extra $425 for the last minute changes on an expensive flight! British Airways said that Icelandair should be covering the costs, but they refused to. I filed a claim with Icelandair, but 2 months later I still have no resolution and they have denied my claim, so I am out that extra cash. Please share this with all of your friends, I don't want anyone else to have to go through this!

### "I would never use them again"
Glasgow to Washington via Keflavik. We arrived without our luggage which the airline left in Iceland. It took them over 3 days to finally reunited us with all of our luggage We had to buy clothes. They have never paid us a penny compensation. They offered to pay us half the cost of one of our party, but have never paid us. They never gave us a baggage missing receipt so cannot claim from insurers. They do not communicate. Worst Airline I've ever used. I would never use them again.

### "can't see how Icelandair is a good choice"
Awful experience with weather cancellation handling and uncaring customer service, I'll avoid Icelandair in the future. I had to continue from one business trip to another and booked Icelandair because it was the quickest way from Orlando to Glasgow, premium economy seat upgrades were surprisingly competitive in their pricing, too. Now I know why. A storm in Iceland caused some delays that cascaded into my flight out of the US getting cancelled. That happens, I understand. But then, Icelandair (without consulting me or my corporate travel broker) booked me on a pair of replacement flights on different airlines leaving 'more than a day later'. Here I am checked out of my hotel being told "tough luck, you can leave in 36 hours or so. The travel agents called to try to get anything that wouldn't require an extra night, but (a) Icelandair was unwilling to book on anything but a narrow set of partner airlines that had no availability and (b) they were also unwilling to comp an extra night's accommodations if more than an extra day was needed. I've had comparable cancellations on other airlines before and they universally did their best to make sure the passengers were properly cared for leading up to a replacement flight. With no other options outside of eating two extra hotel nights myself (one at my origin and one unused at my destination), I ended up needing to cancel the entire Icelandair itinerary and did a last minute rebook—at a way higher price and with dreaded middle seats in front of lavatories—on another carrier. This is all bad, but then I wrote to their social media support to share my experience and politely request some attention to the case, even if it was just extra legroom on the return flight itinerary that was already booked. The response, although not unprofessional, was essentially "we're not obligated to give you anything, we're not giving you anything, but oh, hey, here's a WiFi voucher. Yes, after many hundreds of dollars and several lost hours, a WiFi voucher. Gee, thanks. Like it is with a 1¢ tip, nothing at all would have been less insulting. With all the airline options and now seeing all the similar experiences, I can't see how Icelandair is a good choice. Stuff goes wrong with the chaos of global air travel, and what separates good airlines from mediocre ones is how they take care of their customers getting through the complications. Icelandair seems it couldn't care less.

### "Don't waste your time"
Minneapolis to Munich. To start our trip, we arrived in Munich to find my bag had never left Minneapolis. I filed the necessary paperwork and told them where I was going to be and when I was going to be there. They said shipping my bag would take 1-3 days. They managed to always be slow so my bag would arrive after I had already left the city I was in. To top it off, they would only reimburse me for $100 so I was travelling abroad in the same two pair of cloths for 10 days with no toiletries. Finally, my bag got returned to me two weeks after they had lost it. Don't waste your time, spend a little extra and fly with someone else.

### "experience less than pleasant"
We flew with Icelandair because it was the best fare and it allowed a stopover in Iceland. Originally our outbound flight from Toronto was also with Icelandair but the three of us in our party got bumped to a BA flight to LHR instead. Not a huge issue except that a fourth member of our party, flying under a different booking, ended up at LGW where we had originally intended to fly. Both the GLA to KEF, and KEF to YYZ flights were uneventful. The staff both on the ground and onboard both flights were friendly and professional. I was impressed at the leg room on both flights (33A from GLA to KEF, and 35A from KEF to YYZ). Unfortunately our KEF to YYZ flight was delayed by 20 minutes which ended up causing us to miss our connection with WestJet to YUL. Although Icelandair put us up in a hotel in Toronto for the night, the experience was less than positive. Up to that point things were good. We waited at Pearson for almost an hour with Icelandair trying to find a hotel room for 26 of us (4 in my group plus a group of 22 Germans who were headed to Montreal for a New England cruise) who missed our connecting flight. When they'd finally sorted something out, we were given vouchers for the night plus $20 for dinner and $10 for breakfast. I had asked if dinner would even be available at that hour since it was nearly 11:00pm and were told that yes, the hotel knew we were coming and that food would be available. We were all loaded into private cars and driven 30 minutes to Brampton. As soon as I saw that it was a Comfort Inn, I knew there was no food. The receptionist at the desk had no idea who we were or why we were there. He was incredibly apologetic as he tried to sort out what was going on. He told us that he'd been called and told that the airline "might need 20 rooms or it might be 50" but never called back to confirm any details. So here were 26 people in the lobby of the hotel waiting for things to get sorted out. He opened up the breakfast room for us at least. One of the ladies with the other group started eating bananas, while two others took bowls of dry cereal, as it was the only food available other than the vending machine in the lobby. Finally, at nearly midnight, we fell into bed exhausted. On top of that we had to be back at the airport by 5am to catch our flight to Montreal. On top of this, all of our bags ended up getting put on the flight to Montreal that night, as we likely would have caught the flight itself had we not been delayed at the baggage carousel and then again at security. Icelandair argued with us that our bags were in Toronto even though we all insisted that they were not there! It wasn't until a supervisor with the airline made a call and confirmed that indeed, we were correct, and our bags had been sent through to YUL. I wish I could rate the airline better. The in-flight crew were amazing. KEF is a bit chaotic (well, really chaotic) but the agents we had to deal with in Toronto just put the icing on the cake for me. They made the experience less than pleasant and seemed to pass the buck, putting blame on WestJet for the bag issue while ignoring the fact that it was Icelandair's 20 minute delay that put us all in the situation in the first place.

### "does not care much about customers"
Not Verified |  Denver to Munich via Keflavik. Worry when flying this airline. Before our trip, Icelandair changed the date one of our return legs, but not the other if I had not been carefully monitoring we would have been stuck in Iceland. On Oct 9, we departing Denver, their reservation system failed for an hour in the flight from Denver to Munich, which delayed the flight, and the crew refused to assure us we would make our connection. Then today, Oct 29, on returning from Munich to Denver the desk crew showed up late and were nonchalant about getting started in taking bags. We will probably make it, but it seems this airline does not care much about their customers concerns.

### "Appalling to say the least"
Not Verified |  Orlando to Manchester via Keflavik. They don't offer complimentary food service on an international flight of over 10 hours total, this was a first for me. Basically bring your own food & snacks from home if you don't want to pay exorbitant prices on food & snacks by Icelandair. Appalling to say the least.

### "Absolutely appalling"
Keflavik to London Heathrow. I fly weekly, generally on Emirates or Cathay Pacific. I can tell you that my first experience with Icelandair is the worst of any airline I have experienced. My partner and I were flying from Reykjavik to London and both had connecting flights to make out of London. Icelandair delayed our flight by 3 hours, forcing us to miss our connections. Rebooking our connections cost us almost £1800, and created an unbelievable amount of stress for us. No compensation whatsoever from Icelandair and what’s even worse, I submitted my claim to them almost 3 weeks ago and they still didn’t get back to me. I can’t make a travel insurance claim until they tell me why the flight was delayed. Absolutely appalling. Do NOT fly Icelandair.

### "will not give us any credit"
We were scheduled to fly out of Boston to Reykjavik, but our flight to Boston was late getting to the gate due to weather in Boston. The Iceland air flight left early, and the airline cancelled the return flight. The airline refused to help us book another flight and will not give us any credit. We also lost money on our hotel because we could not fly there.

### "they changed my ticket"
Not Verified | Horrible, I bought ticket Montreal-Reykjavik then they changed my ticket to Toronto-Reykjavik, I had to beg to get a flight from Montreal to Toronto since I live in Montreal. They finally did it but they were expecting us to just accept the fact of flight from Toronto and not Montreal. Then I tried to buy a checked bag and they charged me extra because of my connection flight Montreal-Toronto - what a joke!

### "wife and I had completely different seats"
Extra late takeoff. Rude staff. Seats were reserved in January. We got emails this morning confirming our seats with checkin. When we arrived and got our boarding passes, my wife and I had completely different seats in 2 different rows no longer next to each other. When trying to get it corrected, which took about 25 minutes and 3 people before anyone would even help, we were told that our seats were now taken by other people, and they can't do anything to help. There was only one seat remaining in row 30 when we reserved row 12. Cannot reccomend.

### "losing all 3 pieces of our luggage"
Not Verified |  Prague to Keflavik. Arrived for a 5 day stay over and had every minute planned to visit this beautiful country. That is out the window now due to them losing all 3 pieces of our luggage. We have to cancel our plans for tonight and all day tomorrow to come back for our luggage (if it makes it) and drive through the night to hopefully get to our next destination. Unfortunate as we do not have any of the equipment we carefully packed to enjoy our stay. Thank you Icelandair for making this memorable.

### "Worse than a low budget airline"
Reykjavík to Orlando. Worse than a low budget airline. After paying extra for everything on an international transatlantic flight, not only luggage as we’ve come to expect, but even for food, our tickets were actually more expensive than had we flown with another airline. Even that did not trigger a bad review. It was the fact my wife and me were separated on the flight back. We received two middle seats seventeen rows apart. We’ve flown over fifty flights together, with luxury airlines and budget airlines apart, and we’ve never been seated apart. Moreover, we’ve never had an international plane as uncomfortable as the one on the way here.

### "Book with caution"
Not Verified | Chicago to Reykjavik. Icelandair Experience If you are considering booking travel with IcelandAir, I would exercise caution. In April of 2019, we purchased tickets from IcelandAir. Unfortunately, in mid-May, I had a stroke. With our trip due in July, my doctors indicated I should not travel. I was told my recovery was 9 to 12 months. We called IcelandAir and asked about a refund. We were told no refund was allowed but could change our tickets. The tickets must be used by the date in April we purchased. We asked to speak with a manager and were told no. We emailed to inquire about an option to have 60 additional days to rebook our flight. Customer service agent said the system would not allow this to happen. I asked if they could make a personal decision to override the system to allow us to have an additional 60 days as my recovery would take longer and my children would not return from school until after the date in April we purchased the tickets. We again were told no. I did some internet research and found the department manager and director of customer service. I emailed the manager and still have not received a response. About two weeks later, I emailed the director and still have not received a response. With the departure date rapidly approaching, I decided to dispute the purchase with my credit card company to try to force management to respond to my request. IcelandAir responded to my credit card company with the booking rules and I lost my dispute. If you have a problem once you have booked a ticket with IcelandAir, I would imagine you too will not have access to speak with someone in a decision making position. Book with caution.

### "a low budget airline"
London to Vancouver via Reykjavik. Icelandair is a low budget airline, albeit we fly economy the level of infrastructure, communication, amenities, etc are missing. This creates confusion, a lot of guessing/assumptions, frustration, anger, etc. the main complaint are the seats - old and tired padding/cushioning. KEF was our transfer stop via Heathrow. And our Heathrow leg was delay due to mechanical problems. There is very little to do in the airport and prices are expensive, many of the shops and cafes shut down midday. Free wifi is available in the airport but streaming anything is a problem. On time performance average to poor, on board service average.

### "were thoroughly impressed"
We recently flew with Icelandair from New York to Dublin via Reykjavik and were thoroughly impressed with the service from check-in, lounge, boarding, flight attendants and pilots. We had a couple of issues initially, one out of their control (weather) and the other a mechanical delay. Once we were airborne the flight attendants were some of the best we've experienced. They are very attentive and engaging and make sure their customers are getting the best service they can provide. The initial delays caused us to miss our connection and Iceland Air's staff did their best to take care of us and others on our flight. The Captains provided relevant weather info concerning potential turbulence. They reassured their customers, especially those who don't deal well with it, that it's normal and everyone is in good hands. We saw a few white knucklers relax after the announcements. My wife and I look forward to returning to Iceland for a few weeks as it is such a beautiful place to visit and takes time to see it all. Thank you Iceland Air for treating us so well. We look forward to our next trip with you.

### "never be flying with them again"
Not Verified |  Vancouver to Reykavik. I pre ordered my meals on my flight and they didnt include it in the flight. The attendant made me feel bad about asking to get a refund since I didn't want the other items. I travel a lot and bring my carry on bag everywhere, but on their flight, because of how tiny their planes are, I had to check it for $55! They were rude about it too. On top of it, the toilets were full! I have never in 35 years of traveling seen this. It was disgusting! Their lack in fixing this was so nasty and made me feel uneasy about traveling with them. Like, what kind of airline doesnt take care of the toilets? The flight from Vancouver was over 7 hours long and there were no outlets for my laptop. How is this even possible? The lack of movie options was also super disappointing. Tons of old movies that I have already seen. Bottom line, I will never be flying with them again.

### "ticket doesn’t include baggage"
New York to Hamburg via Reykjavik. I usually don’t write reviews but I have to do this. I was visiting family in Hamburg with my 13 yrs old son. I bought the ticket on another site (justfly.com). It’s a website I use all the time to buy my tickets. On the day of departure while checking in, I was told I have to pay for our luggage since the ticket I bought doesn’t include baggage ($90.00 per luggage). When I told the Rep or Agent that I had now idea because there was nothing on the website that indicated that I had to pay for the luggage, she asked where I purchased the tickets and I showed her. She then told me it’s a third party website that’s why. The tickets were not cheap either ($534.93 per person). After the vacation was over in Hamburg and coming back home, I had to pay another fee for our luggage’s again (88.00 euro) for each luggage. Thank God I fed my son at the airport before boarding because they were selling the food. But coming back we did get our own snacks so that was okay. In all I was really disappointed with the airline not being specific with the type of ticket being purchased. I thought “economy class is economy class” but thanks to Icelandair I now know there are stages. Anyway I’m writing this so other customers don’t make the mistakes I did.

### "avoid traveling with Icelandair"
Reykjavik to Washington. First and only time traveling with icelandair. The flight experience was bad, but they also lost my luggage. My fiancé gave them his luggage seconds before mine, and his made it without a problem. Mine is not only lost and delayed over 2 weeks, but they don’t think they’ll be able to locate it at all. Through this process, they’ve contacted me only twice. I’m going to make sure everyone I know knows about this experience so they can avoid traveling with Icelandair.

### "never book with Icelandair again"
In December 2018, I booked and paid for a return flight to Copenhagen with Icelandair from Edmonton to Copenhagen via Reykjavik. The flight departure was September 11, 2019, and the return from Copenhagen was October 2. About 2 weeks before departure, I found that the leg of the return flight from Reykjavik to Edmonton had been cancelled, and I was advised to contact my travel agent. On September 3 I contacted my travel agent, and on Sept 5, 6, and 7. They tried to rebook each time, but were told that a refund was the only option. I phoned Icelandair myself to try to rebook the cancelled portion of the flight. Although they should have rebooked me at no additional expense, they would not. I offered to pay to cover any route from Reykjavik via any other city such as Toronto, Minneapolis or Vancouver, and I was told no, the only option is a full refund, which I would get in a couple months. I had to book the same flight my daughter booked in February at $1000 dollars more than she paid. I will never book with Icelandair again. I can’t rate a flight, because they refused to fly me.

### "they are really greedy"
Paris to Keflavik. The trip was nice, but they are really greedy: even headphone is paying and expensive! You can’t benefit from entertainment if you don’t have your own headset. It’s the kind of littleness that make you lose client.

### "seats are miserable"
Not Verified |  Boston to Helsinki via Keflavik. When you get on the plane and they warn you they rented the plane because of the 737max being grounded you know it's gonna suck and it did! The seats are miserable, no legroom, no wifi, second rate entertainment, rude attendants. This airline used to be good and why we bought the 6 tickets to get us to Finland. Never again.

### "airline is definitely not worth it"
Not Verified |  Flew from London Gatwick to Keflavik in Iceland on flight FI471 last year. This airline is definitely not worth it. It claims not to be a budget airline but then doesn’t provide any food for free on a 3 hour flight! They do however provide one small drink for free. There was entertainment in the back of the seat but their were barely any choices to pick from and you had to pay for earplugs! The seats were okay but nothing special. The ground crew are so rude. I had special priority boarding thanks to the Gatwick airports hidden disability lanyards and the lady at the gate made a huge fuss about it and made me feel very embarrassed. She clearly knew what the lanyard was for. Finally a nice, friendly lady came over and let me board. The plane was quite old and small. You have to pay for checked in baggage.

### "Do not use this airline"
Minnesota to Oslo via Keflavik. Do not use this airline. In July on a flight to and from Norway they changed our seats from more leg room to less without telling us or reimbursing us for the extra leg room we paid for. Then on the way home from Iceland we bought a set of ear buds and they charged us in Icelandic currency and when converted it came to 138.00 US for set of ear buds, the steward didn't tell us that, they had told us it would be about 7 or 8 dollars. They have refused to reimburse us for the over charge. Ear buds specially the cheap kind on airplanes don't cost 138 dollars Don't use this airline, if you do watch their tactics, they will take advantage over ones trust and naivety. Wish i could rate them a 0.

### "a horrible experience for me"
I was travelling with my wife on 14th August 2019 from Manchester to Manchester to Reykjavik with Icelandair and I had 2 bags to check in which were 19.2 kilo and 13 kilo (23 kilo per bag allowed). My hand luggage was the exact size required but it was slightly bulging and it was slightly difficult to fit in the metal box. I also had a pain in my hand so I was not able to push this very hard inside the metal box. I requested the person on the counter to accept this as I had travelled with this same hand luggage numerous times and there was no issue in the past but I was asked to pay £47 which was shocking to me. The guy on the counter did not wanted to listen to anything. We had no choice left but to pay the charges. Then I decided to try again to fit the bag in the metal box and I took my jacket out from the bag and with the help of my wife we managed to fit this in the metal box and as we showed this to the guy on the counter I could see his pale face and expression. This was a horrible experience for me and I will never travel with Icelandair again. They have no respect to passengers and they are only there to rip you off. I was not asking to give me any favours or break the rules but a little bit of common sense from the guys on the other side of counter would make lot of difference to all passengers and overall good experience to check in.

### "what a mistake it was"
Not Verified |  This was the most uncomfortable flight I've ever been on in my life. My husband and I flew Icelandair to Zurich for our honeymoon, and what a mistake it was. We were packed in to an old 757 jet like sardines with no leg room, small arm rests and rock hard seats. The air was turned off most the time making the plane extremely hot and stuffy. The seats did lean back, but because the seats were so close together, when you leaned the seats back it smashed the legs of the person in back of you. I had the lady behind me begging me to put my seat back up. This was an 10hr red-eye flight overseas! After a miserable 10 hours (and I wish I was exaggerating) we were waiting over an hour for our bags at the baggage gate. After thinking our bags may have been lost (many other people were waitin thinking the same thing) an intercom came on saying something on lines of, 'oops we found some extra bags in another truck and will be putting them through in soon'. Please, please save yourself the misery of flying with this air to Europe. It's not worth your money or your sanity. I've flow with many other airlines overseas and had great experiences: United, American and Hawaiian just to name a few.

### "sold one product and given another"
Amsterdam to Boston via Keflavik. Along with many other of the customer's reviewed here, I was part of the Icelandair's plane switch due to the Boeing 737 Max groundings. The planes that they replaced them with are smaller, cramped, tinny (vibrating quite a bit upon take off), and with really bad entertainment systems (didn't work for half the plane on the Amsterdam-Keflavik leg of my journey) with crummy selections. I used to love Icelandair. I am tall and their extra leg space meant I could still feel my legs after a trans-Atlantic flight. The service was basic, but the flight staff have always been kind and accommodating. And I love stopping in Iceland, it is a beautiful place. The flights this summer were with replacement planes. I was not notified of this when buying the ticket, or before my first flight in June. The seats were extremely cramped and narrow. Sitting all the way back my knees were jammed into the seat in front of me. My shoulders were held tight in order not to cramp others out of their space. The flight staff went above and beyond to make my seating better, and my experience better, but they couldn't change the seats. My main problem is that I was sold one product and given another. The flight staff were apologetic and gave me a card with contact info. This was the replay I received: "I´m sorry ... We are doing our very best in a difficult situation and trying to avoid massive flight cancellations in the best way we can. Best regards" It was a revealing testament to the difference between the flight staff and the corporate office. Shame on you Icelandair, throwing your customers under the proverbial bus. Shame.

### "We received different seats"
Berlin to Vancouver via Reykjavik in July. We still have several claims opened with Icelandair due to different incidents occurred during the flights, this is related the first flight. We were flying with a baby (<2 years) so we decided to purchase seats with more legroom / extra space. We decided to make the reservation for the seats, already in February when we did the purchase of the flight. We did reservation for extra legroom seats for the long flights (between 80- 100€ for each seat), and for normal seats for the short flights (between 20-30€ for each seat). But when we did the check 24hrs before our first flight in July, surprise! We received different seats for all flights (long and short), it was impossible to get our extra leg room seats without paying again, so we decided to complain at the airport before flying, unfortunately without success. Icelandair gave us several excuses: seats are not suitable when flying with babies (why was then possible for us to reserve them? ), airplane change.They said we have to claim for our money via internet / Icelandair webpage customer support. We did it directly after our flight, and currently two weeks later we just have received an email saying that we will be compensated for the extra legroom reservation (nothing about the rest of seats reservation) in 4-6 weeks. Airplanes are old - Food service for all flights (long and short) have to be paid. The food quality and quantity is poor. Service is very slow. Flight entertainment has to be updated - Wifi service only paid service. No Customer service existing when complaining. Seat space is rare and is the same for long and short flights.

### "The aircraft was ancient"
Copenhagen to Keflavik in Saga Class, which is Icelandair's premier cabin. Icelandair uses SAS staff at check-in and the SAS Business Lounge at Copenhagen airport. The lounge was unremarkable but pleasant, affording showers and refreshments. The aircraft was ancient (28 years old) and the Saga Class seats throughout the Icelandair fleet are well behind the times. However, for a short hop of 3 hours they are comfortable enough. On-board service was excellent.

### "They are totally unresponsive"
Not Verified |  Washington to Dublin via Reyjkavik. They forced us a to check one of our bags that clearly fits in the overhead compartments, then they lost it. They are totally unresponsive.

### "Never flying with them again"
London to Washington via Keflavik. The air-hostesses were passive aggressive - which was comical considering they were hurrying me aggressively onto a flight that was delayed by 2 hours and still sat at the gate for an additional hour after boarding. I don't like long haul flights that try to get out of serving food by forcing stopovers and I despise airlines that give you a single cup of a free beverage without any free snacks. You pay $700 for the ticket and they give you a single cup of sparkling water and an attitude. Never flying with them again. The entertainment options were very limited compared to other airlines - and everything was riddled with ads for random icelandic business and overpriced tourist traps. At least 5 minutes of pure ad space before you can even access the main menu. The seats aren't uncomfortable - but lack space. Another issue was that you can't control the airflow to your seat - meaning you'll need to bring clothing appropriate for whatever temperature you're given.

### "zero respect for it's customers"
Seattle to Keflavik. What a joke this company is. If you can fly a different airline to Iceland please do and save yourself the headache of dealing with a company which has zero respect for it's customers. I bought and paid for their "extra leg room" seats ($65 each) and when I boarded the plane the seats I selected were their regular seats, which are extraordinarily cramped. I asked the flight attendant about this and she said, Oh this happens a lot since they change planes. In reality, their booking system is completely screwed up as the plane model was the same on my return flight and had the same exact issue. So they have a known problem which they won't fix, red flag one. Second, they will gladly sell you a seat which doesn't exist, red flag two. I'm directed to contact support over the web for my refund, in reality any reputable airline would refund your money with a simple phone call for this type of blatant screw up. This is an obvious and known error on their part which would warrant swift resolution. But no, I open the ticket and here were are 6 weeks later with no material response from them. They are obviously desperate to keep their $130 and hoping that giving me the run-around via email will get me to forget about it- red flag three. At this point I am done with them and will be pursuing a refund through my credit card company. Lesson learned, never deal with these desperate low budget airlines that nickel and dime for any little thing.

### "avoid this company"
Madrid to Keflavik return in Saga class. In MAD this company does not have any agreement to use the Fast track, nor a Lounge. Boarding is by bus. The flight and the attention on the plane are normal. KEF-MAD The KEF lounge is fine. The flight, without notification of any kind, is made by a charter company, Privilege Style, of which nonca had heard nothing. On the web, when buying tickets and in subsequent mail, no mention of this change. In MAD, transfer from the plane to the terminal by bus. If you can, avoid this company.

### "Worst check in ever"
Not Verified |  Dublin to Reykjavik. Worst check in ever. Don’t bother checking in online if you have a bag to put on the aircraft. You are at the back of an enormous queue of people who are being fleeced to pay to check in. Absolute joke of a check in process.

### "onboard service was excellent"
Keflavík to Copenhagen in Saga Class, which is Icelandair's premier cabin. For this early morning flight, we used the excellent Saga Lounge at Keflavík airport to have breakfast. Flight was on time, onboard service was excellent. The one wrinkle was the boarding process in Keflavík. Icelandair needs to up their game here. As a premium class passenger one expects convenience and not having to jostle to get into the aircraft.

### "the staff were incredible"
Not Verified |  Had a great flight with Icelandair. Seats were very comfortable, we were given blankets and a pillow to add to the comfort. For the entertainment system, it included many films and shows I’ve been looking to see for a while, so I spent most of my time watching films. As for the staff, they were incredible! Between one of my family members losing a Mobile in Reykjavik to another family member taking sick midflight, they were amazing in their attempts to do what they could and showed much kindness. The only problem I had was that the WiFi wouldn’t connect, not sure if it was only me or if it was only the flight I was on.

### "I was happy flying Icelandair"
Iceland was part of my Nordic holidays, I flew CPH-KEF and KEF-AMS. Initially I booked the morning flight from CPH to KEF however suddenly a month before the flight I receive an email from Icelandair, they changed my flight to the afternoon flight due to the morning flight being non operational. I had no other choice as it’s part of my itinerary and I can’t change anything which made me lose almost a day of my trip in Iceland. One day before the flight I receive another email from the airline that the flight will be operated by partner airline Euroatlantic with crew from both airlines, the aircraft was a B767 and looked very old. Everything was written in English and Portuguese, even the entertainment system configuration was 2-4-2 which led to very tight seats especially if you have a huge passenger next to you. Flight wasn’t very enjoyable but crew were fantastic, friendly and always smiling, it was the national day of Iceland so they handed over a small chocolate cake with the flag on it. On the return the aircraft was an Icelandair plane B767 which was much nicer and really comfortable, seats configuration 2-3-2 with plenty of leg room, nice entertainment system, they usually serve tea and coffee and if you want a meal there will be an extra charge. Overall it is value for money and enjoyable. However, on the way from KEF-AMS at Keflavík airport their system was down and it was a chaotic check in for about an hour. I was happy flying Icelandair.

### "not an excuse to lower the standard"
Toronto to Manchester via Keflavik. The ratings below are for the second leg (Keflavik – Manchester). The first leg was marginally better.I fully appreciate that the grounding of the 737MAX must be giving headaches for all airlines who have them, but it is not an excuse to lower the standard to the level which Icelandair have done. My wife & I paid for flexible Saga Class tickets for the above sectors. The first sector was an aircraft so old (at least 25 years old!) owned by Euro Atlantic with cabin staff of Icelandair. We had booked window seats but were given 2 in the middle the aircraft configuration was 2x2x2). There was no place to hang coats, no inflight entertainment (no audio, no visual), no individual fresh-air blowers (the air was controlled for the whole aircraft). To my knowledge at least 3 of the crew had not used the aircraft before and did not know how to either turn on the reading lights or the seat to recline. With regards to the cabin staff I realised how difficult it must be for them to conduct themselves so professionally when they were working in such conditions. A number of cabin staff with whom I talked said that the aircraft should never have been on the north American run and we, Saga passengers, were being robbed. With the late arrival of the first sector (it left 90 minutes late) we had to run to the gate for the next flight. That sector aircraft was waiting for us (we were the only 2 connecting passengers) and as soon as we got on board two things happened. Firstly, before we could find where we were to sit, the door was closed behind us (nothing like having a captive audience when you want to break the bad news to them!!) – it was an all economy flight operated by GETJET with the cabin staff hardly speaking English (the aircraft & crew were Lithuanian) The first time we were aware of a change of aircraft/company was an email which I picked up when I turned off my flight mode on arrival at MAN. After take-off I was asked if I would I like a drink, so I asked for champagne – I was duly handed a small bottle and a plastic beaker. When I asked for a glass, I was told that one was not available. When I asked for our meal, I was told that there was none – not even a snack (yet the email had said there would be a meal). Consequently, from the time of our meal on the flight until we left the aircraft at MAN we had not eaten – some 6 hours. As soon as the cabin staff had gone down the aisle with the trolley they retreated to the front galley and spent the rest of their time laughing and chatting amongst themselves – not once did they go down the cabin to ascertain if everything was fine – or see if someone wanted something. I noticed one female (there were both male & female cabin staff) spent most of her time playing with her hair. I should mention from my seat I had a good view into the galley even though the curtain was pulled as best it could be. Of course, with the 15 minutes between getting off one aircraft and getting on the second one our bags did not travel with us and were finally delivered to our house some 36 hours after we did. Icelandair had a moral duty to inform passengers weeks ago that newer aircraft and cancelling business class to all economy was on the cards – had I known either we would have cancelled and flown home with another carrier.

### "had a great experience"
We had a great experience on Icelandair! We missed our connecting flight in Iceland to Munich but Icelandair gave us vouchers for food and booked us on the next flight to Munich. The check-in staff were nice, the flight staff very friendly, ground staff in Iceland were kind, and customer service on the phone was great .Thank you Icelandair for taking care of us. We will fly Icelandair again.

### "not use Icelandair again"
Chicago to Berlin via Keflavik. Our luggage was lost to include a baby car seat and stroller. We waited in lines and were kindly told to go away by the airport. We called Icelandair and they told us to call the airport. Bottom line they didnt had themselves accountable for our lost luggage and didnt offer reimbursement. Meanwhile we were stuck on our vacation overseas without a stroller and a car seat. It put a big damper on our trip. I will not use Icelandair again.

### "do not fly Icelandair"
Not Verified |  San Francisco to Paris via Keflavik. We booked flights through Icelandair to and from Europe on the way there they lost 2 out of 4 of our luggages. They couldn’t find them for the three days that we stayed in France and we travelled to Spain leaving us without luggage for our month long trip, only finding our luggage about 12 days later. The company still has yet to respond to us so that we can get a claim for our baggage to give to the bank so so that we can get reimbursed, we have travel insurance. Not only have they not responded to us to give the claim but when they first lost our luggage they would not answer our calls leaving us on hold which was costing us money. The only way we were able to contact them was through Twitter, but now they have stopped responding all together. On our way back the plane left 30 min late so we arrived in San Fransisco 40 mins late, because of this we missed our connecting flight to Vegas. Icelandair barely even acknowledged the plane being so late. Overall I would say do not fly Icelandair and especially don’t fly with them if you have to have a connecting flight. Although the stopover was nice and I enjoyed Iceland it is not worth the trouble of flying with them again.

### "worst flight experience"
Philadelphia to Gatwick via Keflavik. I'd like to complain about the services I got. It's supposed to be departing yesterday June 22nd at 830pm. However they discovered there's a problem with the engine after they've pulled out and they need to get a spare part from a different location resulting in the cancellation of the flight. I got rebooked today for flight again from PHL to LGW. However, my seat was downgraded from Saga premium 6A to economy 9A. They claimed they still had a vacancy in the business class, but was unable to offer to me because the aircraft was "no longer overbook". Overall this is one of my worst flight experiences.

### "unfriendly to customers"
Frankfurt to Newark via Keflavik. Greedy, unfriendly to customers. Be warned. Icelandair operates on a stone-age Policy An embassy was still holding my passport for visa when my flight back to Europe came up. Impossible to reschedule the flight without knowing when my passport will be in my hands, I knew I'd lost the costs on my flight. However, it came as a huge shock that Icelandair would refuse to reimburse me for my bag-in-the-hold and in-flight food costs booked online separately from the flight. The greed of Icelandair tops every other horror story on my watch. To top it off, I just received a message that the return trip I cannot take from Newark to London has been canceled somehow, and my flight has been changed to United Airlines at 10 pm, two hours later. United doesn't charge for food on the plane, but Icelandair is keeping my money for the food they're not serving. Unforgivable.

### "last and only time using this airline"
Not Verified |  Washington to London via Keflavik. This was my first time flying with this airline, the check in at Dulles international was ok until we reached the check in, the staff were sullen and then they charged us $100 for each bag by 2 for the outbound flight and the same on the return flight totalling $400. The check in lady stated that it was a budget ticket and we were required to pay for baggage but I spoke with other passengers and they were charges as well.There was no food unless you payed for it and cabin crew were the same cold attitude and barely said goodbye as you left the flight. We didn't mind if we need to pay $20-$30 for baggage but not $200.00 per trip. This will be my last and only time using this airline. The seats we also very cramped, the outbound flight was delayed 2hours and another hour sitting at the gate before departure and no reason was given.Then when we arrived in Iceland we were delayed another hour. We have traveled translantic flight that baggage and food of some kind was included. With the additional charged we could have traveled for less and had a direct flight.

### Icelandair customer review
Not Verified |  Denver to Dublin via Keflavik. Icelandair has done nothing but change, cancel and rebook flights since my reservation. Connecting flights not connecting and customer service will not help with nerds basically leaving you to fend for yourself. I will not use them again nor recommend them to anyone.

### "my luggage was lost"
Not Verified |  Copenhagen to New York via Keflavik. I have flown with Icelandair a few times in the past year. I never had an issue and have always flown business class. On this particular trip, my luggage was lost and for some reason it never had the "Priority Luggage" tag on it. After 10+ hours of traveling, the last thing I wanted was my luggage to not even be placed on the plane. I was treated poorly, until they found out I was not in economy class, but in fact I was in business class. I received a call the next day that it was on a completely different flight and it would be in JFK by 7pm. I waited until 1am to receive a call for my luggage, but was not given one. I checked the website and it stated that my luggage was delivered, when it fact it was not. I dealt with them all day yesterday being "promised " 5 different times on when I should get my luggage. I would have been okay with a proper update or even an accurate time. I did not appreciate how this was handled at all. I normally do not write reviews, but this really makes me think twice on if it is even worth to travel with this airline again.

### "Left a bitter taste"
Not Verified |  I had a mixed experience. I was flying economy with 3 others in my family from Chicago to Reykjavik. Pre-Paid 110 dollars to check a bag 2-way. I had 3 other carry-ons that I have taken on multiple flights with no issues. In Chicago, they said that 2 of my bags don't fit (as in the wheels were out by a half-inch.) But they were nice about it and let me check it in for free. On the way back, I had the misfortune of meeting an unfriendly agent. No name tag. Everyone was called an agent. He said that I have to check all 3 bags as the wheel was out by a half inch. They have a ridiculous sized box, and I was shocked that I have to pay 207 dollars more to check in 3 bags. I had a device to remove the wheels, and so I removed it. He said that it is not enough for it to go in I cannot push it in to fit, but it has to slide in without pressure. He got angry with me and said that I have to check in. My wife and kids were getting nervous, so I went to a different part to check in, and removed the wheels and showed it to another agent, who said that all 3 bags were fine. I still checked it in. This time for free as the bag was eligible as a carry on. They could have offered that to me. I assumed it wouldn't be a problem as the Chicago agent let me do that. Other than that, the agents in the plane were friendly. I could detect this agent's disgust and felt he was picking passenger to challenge. I will probably never go to Iceland again after this experience, forget Icelandair. Left a bitter taste while I was leaving the country. Ridiculous check-in luggage charges and ridiculous that they don't give you a tag to check-in because the bag is a tad bigger. Even though these bags are sold as carry-on bags.

### "like they don't care one bit"
Dublin to New York via Keflavik. Icelandair lost my bag in Reykjavik. I emailed then as soon as I got home. I got one canned email from them and no other contact until today. My bag has been at the Austin airport for 4 day with no contact from Icelandair to let me know it was here. I have emailed them 3 time with no response over the last 4 day. I finally got a call this evening letting me know I can come pick it up. It feels like they don't care one bit! I paid for business class ticket and was treated very badly. A phone call or a follow up email would have been enough but nothing from them.

### "not fly again with Icelandair"
Not Verified |  Chicago to Glasgow via Reykjavik. Late departure from Chicago to Reykjavik causing a near miss on our connection to Glasgow. We also were asked to check our carry on luggage as the flight was full. This might have been ok if our luggage were not lost. Trying to contact the courier service to have our bags delivered once they were located was a mess. Bags were delayed by 3 days. My speculation is that we just barely made the connection and the bags of course didn’t. The personnel at the claims desk in Glasgow were quite pleasant. That’s the only good thing about the situation. On our return from Glasgow the aircraft started boarding an HOUR after listed board time! Hence we did not make our connection USA from Reykjavik. We were put on a flight leaving 3 hours later! No explanation was given for the delay. Horrible service, and will not fly again with Icelandair.

### "the airline cancelled flight"
Not Verified |  Washington to Gatwick via Keflavik. I had my families vacation to England booked for almost two months when the airline cancelled flight. They had no available flights to reschedule us on so I was forced to rebook at $900+ increase on a different airline. How do you cancel an entire flight one month out with no replacement flight. If you would have done this a month or more ago my change in flight might have been considerably less. Will never book with this airline again.

### "my bag did not arrive"
San Francisco to Glasgow via Keflavik. They gave me the wrong meal on the first leg of my flight. Then when I got to my destination my bag did not arrive along with about 6 other people. I called every day and never got an update on where my bag was or when it would be delivered. I never got an apology or anything better for losing my bag and all my stuff and forcing me to spend time I didn't have shopping for basic clothing to make it through a work trip. Not recommended.

### "worst  airline we have used"
Edmonton to Glasgow via Keflavik. We booked our flight to leave April 13-23/19. Weeks later we received an email from them that our flight was cancelled on April 23, changed to April 24. We either had to extend our holiday or pay them a cancellation fee. (Even though they changed/ cancelled the flight we booked and paid for). We had already booked our tours so had no choice but to extend. A few hours before we were set to fly out April 13, our flight was cancelled and changed to leave April 14. We tried and tried and tried to get through to Icelandair on the phone but to no avail. There phone message said the # was unavailable. So they cancelled our flight and we then can’t even contact them!! We drove to the airport to see if we could rectify the situation at the airport but even the Icelandair staff could not get through on the phone to there own company. It must have been in fine print. As I did not see it but you have to pay $260 Canadian to check luggage on an international flight? I read food for purchase/ drinks for purchase but not no where did I see I had to pay for luggage. So again on an international flight to only take carry on. I tried to reach out to Icelandair but they basically told me they don’t care. When they say no service on Icelandair they mean it from the time you book to during the flight and after. We travel a lot and have used many different airlines and by far Icelandair is the worst  airline we have ever used.

### "flight was very uncomfortable"
Not Verified |  London to Keflavik. We booked the seat long time in advance, an aisle and window, than we got an email 36 before the flight that we can check in, but when we tried it told us to check in in the airport. From previous experience, we knew that we could check in online 24 in advance, this is the first misinformation. When we got on the plane we discovered that the aircraft been changed to one leased from a low cost airline and we are seated aisle and middle, and the seats are much smaller than the Icelandair aircraft and the flight was very uncomfortable. If we wanted to book a low cost, we will book low cost.

### "Do not book with IcelandAir"
Not Verified |  Minneapolis to Geneva via Keflavik. Do not book with IcelandAir unless you are happy to have your flight cancelled, in a generic e-mail which says there is a form to request a refund, but there is no form in the e-mail. We booked flights for a major vacation months in advance, booked our hotel, and had been planning the trip with excitement. However with less than a month before flying, we were notified the flight had been cancelled. New flights at this point to a holiday destination were at minimum, $600 more per person. With the two of us, we now needed to find an extra $1200 to travel or cancel our trip and lose all of our hotel costs. The re-booking options landed us in a different city (and incurring more travel costs and the stress of landing somewhere we are wholly unfamiliar with) or arriving significantly later than planned, causing us to lose money on our hotel. Even though there were other flights available, they refused to re-book us on any other airline or refund us enough to purchase a different flight. This has been deeply upsetting and we will NEVER be flying with IcelandAir again. I recommend booking with a more reputable airline, even if the cost is slightly more, because it would have been worth the peace of mind.

### "airline not worth the rating"
Stockholm to Toronto via Keflavik. Icelandair suddenly announced they have canceled before 2 hours of my flight when I asked to the time I would be rebooked the counter told me to call Icelandair. When calling they have left me on hold where no one was picking up and during the process of being on my phone I went back to the counter multiple times and they have informed me that the system haven’t rebooked me yet. Somehow curiosity got the best of me and went to do the checkin process only to find I have been rebooked in the last half an hour before my rebooked flight and I have not received any email or verification about it so I had to rush back to the counter demanding my ticket they still said I wasn’t booked until I proved it by a picture I took in the self checkout, there was my another 20 minutes delay and once I got my ticket I was very close to the gate closing on me and they said it was my fault. This airline is not worth the rating.

### "Terrible seats"
Washington to Reykjavik. Absolutely the worst airline I've ever had the misfortune to fly on. Terrible seats, cabin temp had to be over 78-80, rude flight attendants, paid to upgrade and was denied at gate. Still waiting for refund. They lie. Do not fly with these people.

### "ridiculous baggage charges"
Gatwick to Edmonton via Keflavik. Terrible. The flights were average. But the gate agents charged us 120 for our car seat. After disputing the charge the next customer service reps told us "that would never happen" and allowed us to check our baggage for free. Except when we returned and we were charged another 120. I will never fly Icelandair again. Their miscommunications and ridiculous baggage charges for average service was terrible. And they damaged our luggage.

### "Customer service poor"
Edmonton to Glasgow via Reykjavik. Very poor service. Food poor, baggage not included and no mention of costs to baggage until you arrive. $126.00 per bag ridiculous. Customer service poor. Attitude unprofessional. Avoid this airline at all costs .

### "checked bags and food not included"
Seattle to London via Keflavik. My husband and I bought two way tickets, and somehow we didn't notice that checked bags and food were not included in the ticket price, so we ended up paying over $200 for only one checked bag for both, and meals (meals were rather just a sandwich). Our trip to our destination went well. On our return trip, we had a 25h stopover in Iceland, and leaving Iceland was a terrible hassle, from them giving us a hard time with our toiletries bag (that met regulations, and wasn't a problem in any of the previous flights) so we ended up needing to throw away some of our stuff. Then, we had extra security checks, long lines, that rather made us quite angry, and we are determined not to fly through Icelandair again.

### "last trip with this airline"
This was my first and last trip with this airline. The Boeing 757 from Vancouver to Reykjavik showed signs of age or neglect. The toilet was not working properly, the light in the washroom did not light up brightly. On the return flight, the door would not open and again there was a light issue. Flight attendants were unhelpful e.g. when asked whether I would still make my connecting flight any flight attendant would check, in my case it was an I don't know On my return flight when I posed the same question, the flight attendant said: run, they won't hold the plane for only two passengers. Had I not sat near the exit, not been able to run as fast as I could I would not have made my connecting flight to Vancouver. One wonders why a connecting time of 60 min is even permitted since the YVR to KEF flight will park in a field position. This means taking extra time to wait for the bus, then rush through passport control afterwards cross the entire airport to reach the international area. With one flight a day, any passenger missing their flight will be stuck in Reykjavik until the next day. There is no complimentary food service, but the food for purchase is not very tasty and overpriced. On my way from YVR to Reykjavik they only offered beverages once during a 7 and a half hour flight. On the 3:45 min flight to Munich however, they named through twice and offered water in between. On both legs the flights were late, which resulted in me having to rush and fear I would not make my connecting flight.

### "Food was inedible"
San Francisco to Keflavik. I knew that Icelandair is a budget airline, but surprisingly the flights themselves were first rate - they departed on time and arrived earlier than scheduled. I commend the crew on being professional in this regard. However, everything else was poor! Starting with my seats. I specifically need aisle seats, and chose 15G for the departing flight and 38B on the return flight. Both seats were chosen at random, and even so, in checking with Seatguru.com there is no mention that both of these seats were bad. However, they were terrible. There was no way possible to fit my backpack (i.e. my carryon bag). Why? Because some idiot decided to place a huge horizontal plastic contraption right under the seat in front of mine thereby blocking the possibility of placing anything other than a tiny (4" x 4") item underneath. So I needed to put my backpack in the overhead cabinet. Then on my departing flight a flight attendant (more likely) or another passenger thought it would be cool to move my backpack without my knowledge to the other overhead cabinet across the aisle from me although there was no need to do that. This caused panic when I arrived to open my overhead cabinet and not find my backpack! Had to search frantically before finding it. The cabin crew on the departing SFO flight were okay (two were anyway). However, when it came to the 'meal' service I prepaid for two meals (for my son and myself) yet they claimed I paid for none. They asked to make copies of my receipt so fortunately I thought to print it out and bring it with me. Remember this in case you prepay for anything via their website!! Because this pattern followed for the return flight as well: The cabin crew claimed that I only paid for one meal when my receipt (and my credit card statement) clearly showed that I paid for two meals instead. In fact, before my return flight I paid for extra baggage and received confirmation online. Yet when I got to KEF the staff said I did not pay for second piece of luggage, that it's probably late in showing in their system! What a lie because it had already shown up instantly when their website charged my credit card days prior. Furthermore to their service, I find that overall the Icelandair cabin crew members to be sour, sullen, and really rude. At one point, for instance, the couple in front of us decided to use their right to recline all the way even when it was meal time. I kindly asked the flight attendant to ask them to have them put their seats up. Instead of complying like what other airlines' flight attendants would do without any hesitation, she instead told me that I could recline and eat! I got terribly irritated at that rude reply that I told her that I never eat while reclined. She did finally but reluctantly. To be fair, there were a few (a few mind you) crew members who did their jobs well and were not rude. Also there are tons of staff just milling around gossiping at KEF because it's the passengers who need to do self-service check in! Food was inedible. Not even fit for animals. And exorbitant prices too. Just buy your own at the airport and bring on board. Honestly. Entertainment: Outdated films, head phones costs 5 euro!

### "not purchase their insurance"
Boston to Dublin via Keflavik. I highly encourage all people who book through Iceland Air to not purchase their insurance since they make it very difficult to actually make a claim. This is not a general cancellation insurance. It only covers medical situations covered by a doctor's note. This is very inconvenient and not what most people consider typical cancellation insurance. I even supplied a doctor's summary diagnosis but they rejected it since it was not signed by the doctor. I will chalk this up as just another way that Iceland Air nickel/dimes you after you purchase their tickets.

### "bad way to treat customers"
Keflavik to Newark, had ticket with assigned seats. At checkin Icelandair changed seats, saying assigned seats cost more and we had to paid up or take what they offered. On the 5 hour flight home the first seats assigned to us were empty all the way. Very bad way to treat customers. Never again.

### "I'd rather go Ryanair"
Not Verified |  Manchester to Halifax via Rejaykvik. Pre-ordered food never arrived. 4 flights, of which 3 had technical issues causing delays. Lounge in Manchester is awful. No lounge in Halifax. Baggage left outside and soaked in Iceland. No access to lounge in Iceland because it is on the other side of security. Rejaykvik airport so busy - nowhere to sit. Security queues too long to use lounge Avoid at all costs. I'd rather go Ryanair and that's saying something. To cap it all, on the back of three business class flight tickets they offered £30 compensation in points. I didn't bother responding. My time better spent here.

### "flight was pleasant"
Oslo to Keflavík in Saga Class. If there's one thing that Icelandair is good at, it is its on-time performance for the most part. This 3 hours flight was pleasant, and on-board service was warm. Icelandair's Saga Class seat, while comfortable for shorter flights, is way behind the times.

### "never use this airline again"
Dublin to Vancouver via Reykjavik. We paid $ 176.48 for 1 checked bag each, and was assured this would take us through to Vancouver. When we arrived in Reykjavik we had to go through check in again and told we had to pay another $88 to continue on to Vancouver, for a total of $264.48 for 2 checked bags well under the allotted weight of 50 lbs.each. While going through boarding, a passengers carry on bag was too large to fit in the frame to allow it as carry on, "No problem" they just tagged it and told him to hand it to the flight crew to be stored on board "No Charge" Our departure lounge in Reykjavik. I believe #28 had very few, if any seating most of the passengers were sitting on the floor. Be prepared to take food on board with you or purchase from an extremely limited menu. We each had a pizza, about the size of a thin pocket novel for $11 each. We flew Icelandair about 5 years ago and were so happy with that experience, we raved about them to everyone. We can't believe this is the same airline, while waiting to be boarded, one attendent was checking people through while the other was walking around doing a survey. We will never use this airline again.

### "completely happy with the service"
We got a great deal on the fare from DFW to KEF and decided to give it a try. We knew that luggage was not included in the cheapest fare so we paid just a little more for one person to get a bag included and I just used a carry on which is already included. Overall this was still a very cheap flight. I was completely happy with the service of the airline. It was all very efficient and the employees were all very kind. The plane is a smaller plane for a long haul flight but everyone still had TV screens for entertainment and whatnot so we were happy. Not a luxury airline by any means but let's be honest, neither is American, Delta or United. I would equate it to flying on one of their planes within the US but it is just a little longer flight. If you are not a high maintenance traveler, you will be totally fine on this trip. The only hint I would give you is to bring your own food. We knew that food was not included which was fine. We were happy to pay as the flights were so cheap, but the food was pretty awful. The pictures on the menu look nice but they do not reflect the real food. Asian soup = ramen in a styrofoam cup. Margarita flatbread = microwave pizza in a cardboard box. Other than the food, the experience was great. Sodas, coffee, water, etc. was all free, just bring food with you for the trip and you will be happy!

### "will never use them again"
Minneapolis to Paris via Keflavik. As a budget Airline - you get what you pay for! Our flight was delayed from our origin point due to weather - beyond anyone's control, but we never should have left. We arrived to a madhouse and a grounded airport. Our connecting flight was cancelled due to weather and they did pay for our hotel, but we spent hours in line due to minimal staffing. When we finally left Iceland we were assured our bag got on our re-booked flight, this was a complete lie to clear the airport. They knew our bags would arrive the next day and lied to just get us gone. Then in Paris we had to deal with a third party to find our lost bag and got equally bad customer service. We didn't get our bag for 2 days and easily lost that much of our trip due to their bad customer service. Again - it's a budget Airline so I don't know how much better to really expect. I will never use them again and recommend not flying budget for international flights!

### "luggage been held in Seattle"
Seattle to Reykjavík. We arrived at Reykjavik airport and waited for our luggage for over an hour. Only to find out it had deliberately been held in Seattle because the plane was “overloaded”. This happened to about six other passengers that I was aware of. Which was interesting given that the plane was not full at all. It seems they load it with cargo which takes precendence over passenger luggage. I didn’t receive my luggage until 39 hours after arrival.

### "efficient but perfunctory"
San Francisco to Keflavik return in October 2018 in Saga Class. Icelandair has recently reinstated direct flights from San Francisco to Iceland. On the outbound flight we had a large amount of excess pre-paid luggage that was handled very professionally by the ground staff. As my earlier reviews cite, the boarding process in the USA is very streamlined unlike the chaos at Keflavík. The on-board service on both the segments was efficient but perfunctory. There is no special touch for what is supposed to be a premium class experience. The hospitality ethic is not part of Icelandair's ethos. The hard product is also behind the times. No flatbed here - the seats in Saga Class are more like the First Class seats on US domestic flights. Nevertheless, Icelandair has a good on-time record and they get you to your destination without drama. The boarding process at Keflavík remains a disgrace. The entire scene reminds one of a chaotic bus station in a Third World country. Those flying Saga Class have to jostle with the rest to even get to the priority boarding line. One bright spot - the new Saga Lounge is very nice.

### "last two times were chaotic"
Boston to Oslo via Keflavik. My first time traveling through Keflavik was 3 years ago and since then they have made improvements and expanded, a little. I’ve flown into and out of Keflavik about five times and the last two times were kind of a nightmare. It doesn’t bother me that we unboard on the tarmac and get bussed to the airport doors. It doesn’t bother me that options for food are limited and mediocre. I do like the spicy tuna sandwiches at Joe and the juice. I like to also fill up my water bottle with some wonderful Icelandic water from the fountain . What really upsets me is that the gates are too close together and there is no where for you to sit and wait for your plane without being in the way. Like other reviewers have stated it can be a nightmare when there are multiple flights landing and leaving within minutes of each other. Chaos should not be part of an airports experience. The last two times were truly chaotic because no one knew where to line up, or even if they were at the right gate because the lines extended down the terminal. In fact, on my most recent flight we were told by an Icelandair employee to NOT form a single line because it would be too long! I don’t like queuing up or waiting in line for too long. I’m at an airport so there’s nothing I can do about that. What really gives me anxiety is when there is no line but rather a herd of people forming a bottleneck to get their boarding pass scanned. On this last flight, there were multi times when someone got upset because another person or group got in front of them. I don’t know who is to blame for this terrible design. But it really needs to be addressed, it is a problem!

### "staff at check in particularly rude"
Washington to London via Reykjavik. Not a good choice. No relationship with TSA so you can’t use Global Entry in the USA and a hand baggage allowance that’s so small it’s less than US domestic carriers. Result - travelling clutching valuables after they insist on checking in my one and only piece of luggage. And staff at check in particularly rude. It was a fair priced ticket but there reaches a point when you silently decide you are never going to use an airline again and mention the fact to those you work with. That happened tonight. I suspect it will in the end collapse financially because if it’s going to be cheap it also needs to be cheerful - and it wasn’t.

### "disappointed by the service"
Not Verified |  I have been very disappointed by the service received by this airline. My husband and I fly around 8 times a year and for this trip had upgraded to business class to allow us to sleep. Issue one the first flight was late, there was no communication or organisation of any form by the airport staff. No one had a Clue what was going on and when we would be leaving, we queued up and then told to wait then lined up again, but there was no organisation. For Business class we were expecting a fully reclined seat to allow us to sleep. No. The staff on the flight were rude and no help. When we landed at Reykjavik there was very poor signage and direction to allow us to find our connecting flight. When we eventually did our boarding time came and went, there was an area which had to be emptied of people to then allow us to be checked in. By this time the flight was already delayed with no communication. We approached the airline representative as we were checked in and advised that the organisation was appalling. To which she replied ' I know' and passed us through. When we boarded we were given a shot of fruit juice as we sat down. 45 mins after we were already late we were advised that we were awaiting a passenger and would be waiting a furthe half hour before we departed. A further 45mins later we then started to complete some of the take off routines, and the flight staff were abrupt and not responsive to any queries of the new arrival times. When we arrived in London we then discovered that out luggage had been damaged. After returning home I contacted customer service to explain my disappointment in the service and damaged luggage and was sent the most unapologetic response and damage claim form. I asked to speak to someone on the phone to express my dissatisfaction and was told that they cannot take calls in any circumstances and that I must only follow the claim damage form. I have completed the form and was told it can take up to two weeks for the payment to clear, it has now been over 3 weeks and I have not seen the funds. Customer service and the cabin and ground staff have no interest in you as a customer, even a business class customer. This airline is only interested in profits and taking your money. It is not worth the money and I will not be flying with them again.

### "They lost my luggage"
Toronto to Keflavik. Absolutely garbage airline. While the flight itself was nice, I would never recommend anyone ever fly this airline. They lost my luggage and will make no effort to find it and provide you with absolutely no customer support.

### "most uncomfortable airplane"
Not Verified |  Frankfurt to Seattle via Keflavik. This is the most uncomfortable airplane for a long flight. The seats are not designed to keep the passenger in any level of acceptable comfort. After a hour most passengers are squirming in their seats. In addition the airport in Reykjavík is not large enough to handle the number of flights passing through that location. the airport lacks sufficient gates and must use buses to move passengers to and from their aircraft. the weather is often wet and windy making this method uncomfortable for the traveler.

### "the worst flight experience"
Montreal to Paris via Kevlavik. I was scammed by the worst airline that I ever traveled My last trip has been with Icelandair via Kevlavik. Traveling with them was the worst flight experience that I ever had. I booked my trip in March 2018 for September. I checked at the booking time the company luggage policy allowed me for a big case of 23 kg and 10 kg for the hand case. Meantime they downgraded my ticked without notify me, so when I checked my luggage in Montreal they asked for 120 $ for the 23 kg bag while the 10 kg was free. Too late to challenge this so I paid the money. In the airplane they serve overpriced tasteless food. Only few passengers bought their meal. They are also stingy. If you ask for a Pepsi of Coca, they take the rest of the can and you have to pay if you asked for more. I cannot rate the flight attendants too much because since nobody gets food, they are mostly doing nothing during the trip. Not having a complementary meal during the flight shows the company disrespect towards their customers. On the return trip from Paris I was not willing to pay again for the big case so I got rid of it, keeping the 10 kg only. Surprise they asked to pay 88 Euro, motivating that from Paris the airline charges for hand luggage too. Unfortunately I could not get rid of it because I had some sentimental gifts from my friends which I couldn’t throw away. Knowing how they treat the passengers on the airplane, I bought food from Paris terminal which was three time cheaper than the one from Icelandair plane. The same terrible transit through Kevlavik airport so in the end I made safely back to Montreal.

### "treatment extremely disappointing"
In July 2018 I booked a flight from Edmonton to Iceland through a travel agency for December 15 2018. I called Icelandair to upgrade my seat and was advised that my flight was cancelled completely. Due to this I am out $356 for my hotel. I requested Icelandair reimburse my lost money due to their cancellation and was advised by their reservations that nothing would be done and no compensation would be given. I asked multiple times to let me speak to a supervisor and was told I would not be sent to a supervisor. I am extremely disappointed that Icelandair is taking no action on my lost expenses due to their changes. The treatment and not being able to speak to a supervisor was also extremely disappointing. I travel multiple times in a year and have never been treated so poorly by an airline.

### "a great experience"
Toronto to Keflavik. Icelandair has excellent service. The plane was boarded promptly and left on time. In economy class they give you a bottle of water and greet you. The flight attendants were cordial and pleasant. The value proposition is amazing. For the price we paid we got 32 inches seat pitch instead of 31-29 which would be expected at this price range. We also have IFE in the seatback which was great. Overall just a great experience.

### "Icelandair is a nightmare"
Dublin to Kansas City via Keflavik. For over 3 months in advance of our trip, I attempted to contact IcelandAir about a concern I had with our names on our tickets not including our middle names. I tried calling IcelandAir which would either lead me to being hung up on due to high call volume, or being told I would have to wait over an hour on hold, and end up getting disconnected. The only way I was able to contact anybody at IcelandAir over 3 months before our trip was through Twitter. Icelandair’s website is still confusing, and their response to my basic question about ticket names was vague and unacceptable. They told me to “take responsibility.” I took responsibility by inquiring about this 3 1/2 months in advance. It's not my responsibility for being confused and not able to get a proper response from the airline. That's on IcelandAir. A couple of months later, after several more attempts at calling them, I had another twitter conversation, which somewhat answered my question finally. I then picked out the seats I wanted and had an e-ticket for myself and my wife with our seats printed on it, only to find out the day before our flight home from Europe that those seats weren’t actually ours, and we’d be seated 15 rows apart! After dropping another $430 on business class seats, I ended up having to pay an additional $55 just so that we could sit in the seats we had already originally picked and had printed on our tickets! We flew with 5 other airlines within 2 weeks of our European trip, and had absolute zero issues with every other airline, and only had issues with IcelandAir, that began and continued through over 3 1/2 months from booking until take off. The response I got over email  about our non-business class seats on our first leg flight was “we cannot guarantee any particular seat. We reserve the right to assign or reassign seats at any time, even after boarding of the aircraft as we sometimes have to change aircraft.” Then why exactly did your website allow me to pick seats and then print them on our ticket!? They didn’t change aircraft .We literally had nothing but extreme anxiety during our trip  knowing that we would be flying with this terrible airline who has nobody to speak to in customer relations and could care less about the customer entirely anyway, which has been shown through their complete lack of responsibility. Icelandair is a nightmare.

### "will leave you high and dry"
Edmonton to London via Reykjavik. Icelandair just cancelled our flights to the UK at Christmas. Please do not book with them as they will leave you high and dry looking for alternate (expensive) routes during a busy season.

### "Avoid this company"
Dublin to Baltimore via Keflavik. A horrible experience from start to finish. Booked 2 flights but did them seperately and for some reason 1 had no luggage. I immediately called to adjust this but was told I hadn't ticked the section and instead of paying $10 more for the flight which would have included luggage I had to go online and pay $200 to add luggage. It took 2 phone calls and an hour on hold each time (I'm not exaggerating), and in the end I just paid it it online. Oh well, I marked it as my mistake. Then the nightmare began. Turned up at the airport and the luggage was still showing as unpaid on one flight. I was certain we had paid it online, we received confirmation and the ticket was upgraded to show luggage added, which we had printed out. They said there was an error on the site and the payment was not taken. So despite putting in the payment details, having it shown as payment confirmed on the site, receiving an updated ticket and printing this out and presenting this to the staff, the airline staff now said it was my fault for not checking the payment had gone through via my bank and we had to pay again. As a result we now had to pay $140 for the baggage (one way), which we had no choice but to pay. They wouldn't even allow us to pay the $100 for one way which we thought we had already paid (I'm putting it in dollars but actual payments were a mix of $, £ and Euro). On the stop over in Iceland we complained to the help desk and they said they understood and that it wasn't out fault. We were told that a note was added to the system and we wouldn't have to pay on the way back and if we emailed customer support (no way were were going to call them again), they'd refund the money. We were very anxious about it and emailed customer support during our trip, and it got worse. They said there would be no refund and we would have to pay for luggage again. We explained, they asked to be emailed proof. We sent photo copies of the payment confirmation and ticket showing luggage, and they didn't reply. We tried again a second time and exactly the same, they said it was our fault and asked for proof, we sent it, they didn't reply. As a result we paid for the luggage again on the way back. To rub salt into the wound we had paid for exit row seats and during the online check in one of us was switch to a standard seat in the middle. We tried to change this online and it asked us to pay $60. At this stage we were too tired to try to fight it. We didn't pay and sat seperately and just got the horrible experience over with. We since complained to their customer service and suprise suprise there was no response. Anyone thinking of using this airline please do your research and read up on the many complaints you'll find about them online, especially with regards to customer service. It's possible that if there are no small errors or mishaps you would not have to deal with their customer service and then write a review about their Ok leg room and slightly bigger than average inflight screens, because you haven't experienced the customer service or been caught out by their small print tactics. But any slight issue or changes and you are in for a nightmare - it's really not worth the risk. Avoid this company at all costs. I just wish we'd been warned and read the reviews.

### "never fly Icelandair again"
My husband and I flew Icelandair to Munich from Toronto on August 8, 2018, switching planes in Iceland.We had flown Icelandair in 2015 to Germany and were pleased with them. When we checked in in Toronto we found out we had to pay $225.to check in our luggage.We didn't have to pay for luggage in 2015. A lot of people didn't know about this change until they checked in.We arrived in Munich but not our luggage.After filling out paperwork we were told we would be contacted.We contacted them the next day and we're told our luggage was in Iceland and would be shipped to us in Germany.Five days later my suitcase arrived and a suitcase belonging to someone else.My husband received his suitcase 2 days before we were to return home.On the way home we were agin charged over $200. to check our bags in.We also found out we weren't seated together on either flight.The lady checking us in was able to seat us together from Iceland to Toronto. From Munich to Iceland I was seated in row 14 seat a and my husband was in row 23 seat a.When you are married and buy tickets together you should be seated together. We have not been able to recover anything because we didn't save our luggage tags . We will never fly Icelandair again.

### "not fly this airline again"
Oslo to Toronto via Reykjavik. Flight over to Copenhagen went well, assistance for my sister as requested, although all luggage lost and not received until the next day. Return trip started going sideways in Reykjavik. Plane was scheduled to depart at 5:05, sat waiting for a connection flight and didn't leave for 35 minutes. Toronto, a disaster--one bus sent for all passengers to go to terminal 3. The doors of the terminal wouldn't open for people to get on the bus. Finally another bus came, I got to terminal 3 and waited 1.5 hours for our luggage to arrive and thus missed our connecting flight to Regina. We had to spent the night in the airport, get in line at 4:30 am to rebuy tickets to get home. I contacted their customer service and they said they were not responsible as we were using another carrier to get to Regina. I pointed out they do not service Regina and had they left on time, and got us to the terminal and sent our luggage over in an efficient manner we wouldn't have missed our flight. We will not fly with this airline again, they are just not into solving the problems they create.

### "seating was terrible"
Not Verified |  Hamburg to Detroit via Keflavik. Good choice if you are on a diet and love jogging. I paid almost $4500 for two people for a flight to Germany! No food unless you have a credit card that works (I use discover). The seating was terrible; since I was in the last but second row, I could not recline because the person behind me complaint and protested vehemently because their seat did not recline. We arrived in Boston around 7:15 pm and had to board another plane at 8:06 pm. Almost impossible! We skipped lines, begged people to hurry up and managed only to catch our connecting flight because it was delayed by 40 minutes.

### "Very poor customer service"
Dublin to Boston via Reykjavik. Icelandair seems like a good idea because of their competitive prices, but this low cost is met with poor service and incompetent staff. My baggage was lost traveling from Boston to Dublin and 3 days later in Boston I am still yet to receive my luggage. The airline has made little to no effort to inform me with what has been happening with my luggage, they’ve made no effort to compensate me for the cost this has added to my trip or the fact I have had to give up almost an entire day to wait for my luggage which has yet to arrive despite arriving in Boston hours earlier. The Boston ground staff were so incredibly rude and were not willing to help me in anyway. In fact, they made me fill out a form to submit that i’d lost my bag and did not even fill the form correctly and so this has added to the delay. The flight itself is small and is very basic. Do not be tempted by their low prices as it is very much reflected in their service. Very poor customer service and I can’t believe they’ve made no effort to compensate me for my loss time and the money I’ve had to spend.

### "our luggage was lost"
Chicago to Reykjavik. My son and I flew to Reykjavik on July 26 for what we thought would be a once in a life experience to visit Iceland. It ended up being "once in a lifetime experience" but for a very different reason. We arrived at the airport in Reykjavik on July 27 and went to collect our luggage. After waiting for more than an hour, we realized that our suitcase did not make it. Therefore, we went to the customer service of Iceland Air, which is called Iceland Air Ground Services (IGS). The woman at the counter initially did not even acknowledge our existence. However, after about 10 minutes she finally asked us if we needed anything. I told her that our luggage was missing. To which she replied, do not worry this happens on almost every flight. (This is something they do not advertise) Then she said that she would fill out a form and our luggage would be delivered within 24-48 hours. We scheduled a trip with stops in different cities every day so our trip was messed up already. Unfortunately, at this point, there was nothing we could do. So we took the form and left. We called Iceland Air Ground Service after 24 hours to find out the status of our luggage. We waited on the phone for 45 minutes before someone extremely rude picked up the phone and told us that if we did not get our luggage to call the 800 number for Icelandair. So we did that. After waiting for another 30 minutes, we finally reached someone in Philippines who told us that they know nothing and that we need to check the status on their website. So we did that as well. There was nothing there. I called every number that Icelandair has listed( losing 30 minutes to an hour of my precious vacation time that was scheduled out very carefully), every time I was told that either that was wrong department or I need to check the status online. Every single day instead of enjoying our vacation, I was spending 2-3 hours on the phone with Icelandair. Which got me nowhere. Every time I had someone rude to tell us that if we did not liked the service, we should not fly Icelandair. (“Nice" Customer Service) So we spent 8 days without any clothing. We wasted two days looking for stores and places to buy the bear minimum of what we needed for this trip. Our vacation was completely ruined. When we came to the airport in Reykjavik on the way back to Chicago, I stopped by the front desk of Icelandair to let them know what kind of experience we had and that our luggage was lost. The woman at the desk was very unhappy that I told her my about my experience. Moreover, she got really upset when I told her that Icelandair did not provide even the minimal amount of customer service. Her reply to us was this: If you do not like it, I can take you off this flight.

### "separated my wife and me"
Not Verified |  I paid extra to get bulkhead seats for my wife and me on July 31, 2018 flight FI 623 from Keflavik to Newark. But Icelandair changed the aircraft in the last minute. Not only we did not get bulkhead seats, they separated my wife and me. I asked an air flight attendant to change seats with some one, but she did nothing, and was rude. Another complaint - 6 hour flight with no snack or anything.

### "Very devastating"
Minneapolis to Keflavik. Icelandair cancelled our flight a little more than 3 hours before our departure due to mechanical issues . They rebooked us on a flight for 24 hours later. After being on hold for an hour they said if we could get to the airport within the hour we could fly out. Then said a few minutes later that they couldn't do that. We had to cancel our vacation, tours, lodging, flybus as it was only a four day vacation to begin with. Too late to get all monies back. All the planning, preparation, and excited gone in the last minutes. Very devastating. Wished I had read reviews as this seems to be common occurrence for them. Customer service is horrible. Not holding my breath for them to recoup our losses. Missing a once in a lifetime trip.

### "Thank you Icelandair"
My son flew as an unaccompanied minor from Geneva to Baltimore via Keflavik. He said he had a wonderful experience and all went very smoothly. Thank you Icelandair for taking such good care of my child. It was very hard to find an airline that would accommodate this service and hard to hand off my child to strangers Icelandair was so easy to work with!

### "My last flight with them"
Oslo to Toronto via Keflavik. Three years ago Icelandair sent our luggage straight through to Toronto which we did not request. This trip the just simply lost my daughter's luggage. Worse, they did not show much interest in getting our lost bag to us. Our flight was Wed and we finally - after much stress - got our bag on Sunday. At first they told us the case was closed and the bag was in the hands of the courier. This turned out to be incorrect. The courier told us that they had no idea where the bag was. Contact with Icelandair was  very difficult. They are masters of the "it's not my job" response. My first flight with Icelandic was in May 1978. My last flight with them was just last week. In the future we will only fly with carriers who take customer service seriously.

### "easily the worst airline"
Not Verified |  I recently went to Iceland for a holiday but Icelandair made my stay there very hard to enjoy to say the least. First, they lost my bags which had all my belonging in there (warm clothes, sleeping bag, tent, and some food). I was one of 6/7 people from that flight who lost our bags. I only say "lost" because they had no idea where it was or when it would arrive. This was a direct flight with no transfers. I was told to "keep checking" online for an update. I would like to think I am a reasonable and understanding individual but when you misplace that many bags in one flight it is a problem. Yes, it may be that there is a disconnect between where a passenger is flying out from however, that is Icelandair's problem and responsibility to figure out. They just seem to put the blame on everyone else. Apart from that, Icelandair's service throughout this event did not make it any easier. While I was at the airport I asked multiple staff members from Icelandair what the policy is for lost/delayed luggages. Nobody knew. One lady said I would have $100 within 24 hours and everything else I can "try" to claim but no promises. I then called the hotline and asked the same question only to get the same response. I asked about hotel compensation since my friends and I rented a car and were planning to camp. The response I got was, "That would not count because your hotel was not in your luggage". Actually, my tent and camping gear was in my luggage and that was my accommodations for the trip. Because of them, I slept in the car freezing for 2 nights. I finally received my luggage the day I was flying out. Thank you Icelandair for not ruining the rest of my holiday as I was continuing my trip to Switzerland. Finally, after 2 weeks of submitting my claim I get a response from them. They are willing to reimburse me for the 2 pieces of clothing I purchased while I was there. However they are not willing to refund me for the checked bags. I paid for a service that did not deliver. Also, I did not check in my bag the day I left even though I prepaid for it. I would never trust them with my bags and the gentleman at the airport said I could email you and get a refund. Clearly he was wrong. Icelandair is easily the worst airline I have ever dealt with. Forget compensation for the trouble they made me go through.... they are not even willing to pay me back for a service that did not deliver. Checking your bag in is very expensive with this airline and they only care about making money instead of great customer service. I will never fly with this airline again.

### "Last time flying this airline"
Seattle to Bergen via Reykjavik. I flew alone with an infant and the flight experience with  staff really great. They tried to find me a seat for my infant but the flight was full, so they let me sit in the back and gave my kid treats and cups to play with to keep her satisfied. However reaching my destination they lost my luggage, and you can imagine traveling with a baby how bad that is. It’s been 6 days and I still haven’t heard anything. I’ve made claims and called them everyday. They won’t reimburse me any expenses until they have processed my claim which can take up to 30 days. This is to me the worst customer service. I’ve been without my luggage for 6 days and counting and all I get from the airlines is I’m sorry for the inconvenience and we will contact you when we find it. Last time for me flying this airline unfortunately as this is just too much

### "Instead we feel scammed"
Minneapolis to Dublin via Keflavik. My husband and I purchased tickets back in November without the knowledge that we would have to pay a whopping $100 each way for each of us to have checked luggage. That added an extra $400 to simply get our bags to and from our destination. Icelandair should have made this clear from the start about this ridiculous fee. Instead we feel scammed. Never again will we fly icelandair. On top of this, the airport experience is awful. You have to stand shoulder to shoulder to simply board your plane. Since your airline is growing, please grow your airport with it.

### "our travels went well"
Denver to Oslo via Reykjavik. We were a bit skeptical seeing other reviews for Icelandair, but our travels went well. Being cautious We arrive 2 1/2 hours before take off for check in. There was no line! In the past, they used Lufthansa check in. Now they have their own desk. Check in was fast, requiring only a scan of our passports. Note, Icelandair does not participate in Pre-TSA, so you will need to go through the regular line. Fight service was very friendly. Apple pillows and blankets are provided. You do have to either bring your own food or buy on board. There were choices of 3 - 4 meals, plus snacks to purchase. Entertainment was very good. About 30 or so movies/tv shows to stream on demand. Also, music and other audio. My only complaints: I'm a fairly skinny guy, and there didn't seem to be enough seat padding for the 6.5 hour trip. I improvised by using blankets to sit on. Also, my wife seat did not go back, probably broken. Customer support via phone - there were a couple of time we had to call post-booking. Generally had to wait about 45 minutes for a rep to pick up. We connected at Reykjavik for our flight to Oslo. Plane de-boards on the tarmac with bus to the terminal. You will need to go through passport control to get to the connecting flight. About 30 minutes from landing to connecting flight.

### "Bad experience in so many ways"
Not Verified |  London to Minneapolis via Reykjavik. There is something a bit twisted about offering no free food on a six-hour international flight and then parading the staff up and down the aisle pushing their luxury goods. Will never use this airline again; my flight was late leaving Heathrow and there was no time to eat a proper meal before running to catch the connecting take the connecting flight. Dreadful in-flight entertainment and I spoke to other travelers who also said they would never fly them again as their flights left on time but arrived late anyway. Reykjavik airport is small, crowded, and lacking in amenities. Bad experience in so many ways. Avoid.

### "Will never fly again"
Not Verified | Reykjavik to Toronto. The short version is that after a six hour flight, we (a majority of the travelers) were sent back and forth between two luggage carousels only to be told that our luggage was somewhere. Well, somewhere on the grounds, they just didn’t know where. With very little help from customer service and a three hour wait, our bags finally came. Three hour wait after a six hour flight with no compensation or apology. Awful experience. Will never fly again.

### "customer service line is appalling"
Gatwick to Edmonton via Reykjavík. Never will I use Icelandair again. Our bags were lost and now they have been sent to Malta Airport and have not made arrangements to send them on to us. One has arrived today the other maybe tomorrow. Their customer service line is appalling and I am number 83 in the queue which means another large bill. We now are supposed to go and collect them and they are not being delivered.

### "never fly this airline again"
Not Verified | Washington to London via Reykjavik. We had an issue with one member of group flying with us. The gate representative gave us incorrect information regarding how we should remedy our problem which cost us over $1000. Then when we tried to return home they said they could do nothing to help us and their only solution was a one-way ticket for $2200. We found one on their airline for half that. Airline took bags one way of the trip with no problem but then said we would have to pay on the return trip with the very same bags. Completely arbitrary how they handle luggage. They also lost a bag for us. Customer service representative was smug, rude, and completely unhelpful in any way. He refused to transfer me to a supervisor despite numerous requests. I will never fly this airline again.

### "always very pleasant and willing"
Amsterdam to Denver via Keflavik. I fly monthly to Europe from Denver. Usually with Lufthansa but sometimes with Icelandair depending on my city of destination. I like flying Icelandair. They have a very efficient connecting system through the hub in Reykjavik (KEF). Passing through Immigration never takes me more than 5 minutes despite what appears to be long lines. All the overnight flights arrive early morning and flights to Europe leave an hour or two later, but always with plenty of time for connecting and they know you're coming, so if needed they wait the plane for everyone to get boarded. I experience they significantly 'pad' their schedule times, so despite late departures, I seem to always arrive more or less on time. The evening flights back to Denver are the exception, as this tends to be 40 to 60 minutes late. I don't have a connecting flight in DEN so not an issue for me, but connecting passengers take note. I sense Icelandair is a proud national airline and takes pride in what they do and making a best effort, from flight operations to the staff. They are always very pleasant and willing. Much like the wonderful people I meet while exploring the island. The #stopover program is excellent. Take advantage. Iceland is a great place, even now that Iceland has been discovered. The wonderful 757 is getting on in age but Icelandair maintains a fleet of them very well. I fly both SAGA business as well as Premium Economy, which they have recently discontinued. SAGA is not a lay flat business seat, but rather like a first class seat you get with domestic flights in USA. But plenty comfy to get a few hours of sleep on a 7 hour flight to KEF. The economy seats are also well designed and comfortable and with 32" pitch, enough space for 7 hours. Seatback entertainment is standard and good. Food in SAGA is as good as any other BC with excellent and attentive service. Food in coach is for purchase but good range of selection and reasonable priced. Icelandair has to compete with other low cost carriers as all airlines do, so they offer options from economy light to business class. For example, Icelandair is now in a significant market share battle with rival Iceland based WOW airlines, which is a true budget airline with all of the associated hidden fees, bad customer service etc. Icelandair is a proven lower cost (than Lufthansa, United, legacy carriers) airline that is a pleasure to fly for the price/value.

### "carry-on had to be checked"
New York to Amsterdam via Reykjavik. The dimensions of baggage they may be carried on to the plane are smaller than in all other airlines: they are smaller. Hence the carry-on suitcases we have used for all previous flights within the United States and abroad, and which fit easily into overhead compartments on other airlines, were too large for Icelandair and had to be checked. No point in planning not to check in your bag for your Icelandair flight: they will make you check it.

### "Neither bags showed up in Zurich"
San Francisco to Zurich via Keflavik. Checked a bike in SFO along with another package. Neither bags showed up in Zurich and after two days Swissport has no info from Icelandair on their location. Icelandair uses contractors so dealing with someone who is accountable is impossible. Fly with airlines that have their own employees. At least you will get answers when things go wrong. I’m sure Icelandair will not compensate me for the full value of the bike.

### "charges you for everything"
Geneva to Minneapolis via Keflavik. I fly oversea flights quite frequently, and this is the first airline that does not give you a snack on the flight. If I had known they did not serve anything to you I would have chosen a different airline, but I would have figured they would give you something. The other airlines I have been on they have given multiple meals, but Icelandair charges you for everything but the basic beverages. I was not impressed with that. The staff was friendly and all and helpful.

### "herded like cattle"
Cleveland to Frankfurt via Keflavik. Worst trip I’ve ever taken. Both directions we were 6 hours late. Herded like cattle in iceland. Had to go to airport myself and find my luggage after five days of no assistance. Who flys overseas and has to pay for luggage ($100 a bag) and has to pay for all food on the flight. Also not an airline for young kids or the infirm. You are bussed to your plane and have to walk up steps, sometimes more than one before you go anywhere.

### "leave a lot to be desired"
Geneva to Seattle via Keflavik. The last time we flew Icelandair we received complimentary meals. This time we used miles to fly home and were not sure about the food options as we booked through Alaska Airlines. At check-in we asked about food and were told that we would receive a meal. At Geneva Airport there were all sorts of options for takeaway food just to clarify. So were surprised on flight when we were told food had to be purchased from the menu. This menu was ghastly. I chose a chicken sandwich only to be told it was not available. Chose hummus, not a well prepared item. We decided to pick up some food at Keflavik Airport for the longer leg to Seattle. The plane was late leaving Geneve and did not make up any time on flight so we arrived late, the airport was a zoo with lines backed up every turn. We were not able to pick up any food, lucky to make our flight. So decided to try for chicken sandwich again (I was at front of plane mind you) only to be told again that it was not available. Chose an egg sandwich from which I had heartburn for rest of flight. The attendants were nice, but the meal options and ineffiency of this airline leave a lot to be desired.

### "leave your schedule open"
New York to London via Keflavik. I wouldn't say that this is the worst airline ever, but I wouldn't book with them if you have reservations at a certain time after your flight, just leave your schedule after the flight completely open. Both of my flights got me to my destinations late and I dont know if its the airline or the airports, I just think its crazy that the only time I flew with Icelandair my flights were late, and the last one caused me to miss my bus from New York to Philadelphia, which I scheduled for 2 hours after I was expected to land to be on the safe side. The plane flew around in circles and added an hour to our trip (it even showed on the flight map how many times we literally went around in circles). When I departed to begin my trip (in New york) I had to get a printed out ticket even though I checked in online and when I asked a staff member what the point of me checking in online was if I had to do it again at the airport she replied "so you can pick your seat" with an attitude. I fly all the time and have never needed to do that. When I was in Reykjavik and went to the bag drop off to check in and obtain a paper copy of my boarding pass (even though i had an email copy) since that was apparently Icelandair policy the woman looked at me like I was crazy. I explained to her what happened in New York and that I was just trying to ensure I covered my bases, She printed out my ticket and snarkily said "now you have a printed version of your boarding pass". What the heck? Other than those few things I thought the staff were really pleasant and helpful, but I might just spend a little more money to book with a more reliable company because I'm beyond annoyed I had to find another bus to Philadelphia from new york at the last minute that left after 10pm and spend money on another bus ticket.

### "hot meal only for sale!"
Hamburg to Newark via Keflavik. I could not imagine that on a Transatlantic flight (duration more than 5 hours!) this company did not even offer any snacks to the passengers. I travel quite often and it was first time when the airline not only provide a free hot meal (only for sale!) but did not even give some chips or pretzels to us! No free earphones as well. It looks like their management does not care about their passengers. The only nice touch was a cute bottle of water when we boarded the craft.

### "cabin crew nice and helpful"
Not Verified |  On June 3, 2018 I flew on Icelandair, from Cleveland to Glasgowwith a layover in Reykjivík. The planes were a 737 max 8 and a 757-200. There were no delays except for a little one due to the weather in Iceland, but overall, nothing too bad. The seats were comfortable on both aircraft, and the bathrooms were very sanitary. The cabin crew were nice and helpful, and had proper ettiqute. I would highly recommend flying with Icelandairt.

### "undergoing severe growing pains"
Oslo to Seattle via Reykjavik. Nice idea, to stop over in Iceland for a few days on your way to or from Europe. It was fun the first time I flew Icelandair. Unfortunately the airline, and the Keflavik airport, are undergoing severe growing pains and are not capable of handling the traffic they are booking. They are disorganized, understaffed, and the passenger accommodations suffer both in-flight and on the ground. The seats seem to be the tiniest in the industry. The waiting rooms in Keflavik are severely overcrowded. They charged me $95 to check a single bag each way (okay, I got a good deal on the ticket, but had I known...). And when I got home and checked my bank account, I found out they charged me $23.32 for a single in-flight beer (a can of Gull, which was warm). The flight steward was having trouble with the card reader, so maybe I got charged for multiple swipes, but good luck getting Icelandair to respond. The web form for complaints won't send, and the phone number cannot accept any calls due to high volumes. Right. Do yourself a favor and fly SAS.

### "nightmare connecting through KEF"
Geneva to Seattle via Keflavik. I used to love Icelandair, and thought it was a well-kept secret for getting from North America to Europe. Smaller planes, easy connections through KEF, Nordic service. No more. It is an absolute nightmare connecting through KEF. There are not enough gates, too many flights arriving and departing at the same hour, and a bottleneck through passport control. Both directions, I had to sprint to make my connections. And that's just unacceptable. I flew Saga Class, which used to be much nicer. There was no priority boarding, and the seats are more akin to a Premium Economy seat. The seats didn't really recline, but strangely, nor did they stay straight upright. Four different seats, and they all kind of sagged back when I sat in them. Flight attendent assured me it was "by design" So, not comfortable as a recliner, and not comfortable in the upright position, either. Food and service in Saga class was good, I must say. Also, before my trip started, I had to change my return date. It took 11 days to get a response from Icelandair that the change was made. Unacceptable. I will not do the tense, stressful connection through KEF again, though. Shame - it used to be a great way to go.

### "Worst airline experience"
Zurich to Minneapolis via Keflavik. Worst airline experience ever. After baggage fees, it costs the same as Delta. You're charged $100 USD for any carry on over 10 pounds. Save your time and frustration by flying another airline. Try calling the customer service number,they don't even staff the number! If you want something changed, you need to fill out a form online and hopefully someone will contact you. Hint - they never do.

### "we never got a seat next to each other"
I booked my Icelandair flight 6 months ago with my wife from Gatwick to Iceland and Iceland to Seattle and we never got a seat next to each other. They said that there were no seats available and they cannot make changes. There was also no complimentary meal served from Iceland to Seattle which was a 7.5 hours flight. They just served water.

### "and still no luggage."
Stockholm to Boston via Rejkavik. When checking in (18 hours), there was no seat assignment for the second leg of flight - called Icelandair number - on hold for over an hour. They told me they couldn't address it because it was a "system problem" and they could fix it at counter. At the airport counter, they couldn't assign a seat because it was a "system problem" and the said they could fix it at the next stop. At the next stop, they told me the flight was overbooked (now I understand) and were able to assign a seat. When we arrived in Boston, the jetway was broken and couldn't connect to the plane doorway. So they had to use stairs for the exit and called for a bus. It took over an hour for the bus to arrive. When the bus finally arrived, I discovered that my luggage didn't. It is not easy to find an IcelandAir agent but when we did, the system wasn't working so he couldn't enter the claim. He did give me a claim number but unfortunately it only had 9 digits and the online IcelandAir baggage locator requires 10 so it didn't work. I called Iceland Air again and was on hold for 1 hour and 45 minutes (in my opinion, they are understaffed) and was quite frustrated. I was then routed to the baggage claim who hung up on me (which was quite discouraging) without addressing the lost luggage. Adding it up - 2 hours and 45 minutes on hold and 1 hour waiting for bus and still no luggage. I am not quite sure what to do next.

### "I was not impressed!"
I was not impressed! The baggage fees, lack of inflight services, lack of communication (4 minor delays), and uncomfortable seats were all pretty disappointing! I would avoid Icelandair. Unfortunately, our tickets were booked as part of a tour package. I'm not sure how Icelandair is a positive to tourism promotion. It felt like torture! That being said, our US bound flight was a newer plane and much better. The airline needs to get their act together and reorganize. I think it would have been more tolerable if they had communicated what was happening and when. People were frustrated! I fly/travel quite a bit, and this was probably my worst international experience!

### "customer service is horrible"
Edmonton to Oslo via Keflavik. Never again. Ok I have been on the waiting line for 2.5 hours. Customer service is horrible. I could not believe that such a terrible service exists. My flight is from Edmonton to Iceland to Norway and I only have one hour stop in Iceland. They said they cannot connect my flight and I have to collect my bag in Iceland and check in again. I cannot do it in 1 hour, they keep saying that since it is a low fare airline they do not connect and now I am trying to get refund.

### "airport staff seem unnecessarily rude"
Newark to Keflavik. Myself and my wife flew for a week vacation in Iceland. As first time visitors to Iceland and to Icelandair I have a few comments. Our flight and luggage handling were smooth. The only gripe I have is the staff in Newark and Keflavik airports. They seem unnecessarily rude and not friendly. We fly quite a bit and this is the first time we have seen such behavior from a non US airline. Also the hotels that are part of the Icelandair vacation packages are substandard. Although some of them are international chains and some owned by Icelandair themselves they all need some improvement. Otherwise the time spent was fabulous.

### "Stay away from this airline"
Keflavik to Washington. Icelandair is supposed to be a “flagship airline” of Iceland. However, they operate like a low-cost budget airline. The cabin is very uncomfortable, and the check-in staffs at Keflavik airport are very incompetent and rude. And of course, since this is a cheap “budget” airline, there are many hidden fees. I demanded an explanation for an additional fee to a check-in staff at Keflavik Airport, but due to his incompetence, he failed to provide an answer. Stay away from this airline.

### "passengers surprised and unhappy"
We bought a Vancouver to Brussels (via Reykjavik) ticket in December 2017 planning a bike trip, we were checking 2 bicycle boxes and 2 backpacks expecting to pay the usual flat fees for it. No other special warning of any sort. Icelandair since March 2018 considers that a flight ticket with a 90' connection in Reykjavik is like a 2 legs trip. So all the fees need to be paid twice! 2 fees / bike (2x300$) and 2 for the first luggage (2x125$). Total 425$/person, Cad$ 850! For a couple attempting to fly Icelandair with a return ticket, they can expect to pay for 2 luggage another Cad$ 500, a family of 4 will pay $1000 on top of their flight tickets if they carry only one baggage each! Glad we bought only 2 one way tickets. I had a “convivial” conversation with the agent at the checkin arguing that tickets have been bought in December and we should not be impacted by that new rule Implemented in March 2018. Also, in my knowledge no other airline charge twice the fees when you have a flight connection (stopover) with the same airline company. The counter agent "x" ( who refused to give us her name or to call for a manager! Rather to send us to the website to fill up a complaint form) stayed professional but confirms a lot of passengers are surprised and unhappy. Icelandair is working hard promoting intercontinental flights, all flights include a stopover. This a very poor commercial way to make business.

### "full of frustration and unpredictability"
Icelandair is a budget airline and unless everything goes completely smoothly (which doesn’t always happen), you’re definitely going to notice the budget part. The check in process was fine although they insisted I check in my carry on bag as the flight was very booked and there was limited cabin space. I agreed although upon them losing my luggage, I was not too happy I did. Plus it would have been nice to have brought/taken back more things had I known my bag was going to be checked anyways! I’m still waiting to see if they’ll let me be over the weight limit of a carry on since I had to buy clothes in Europe due to them losing my luggage roller. Hard to say though as my return flight has been changed to United, I fly an hour earlier as planned, and my flight is hours longer in duration now. Plus, I still am allowed no checked baggage, yet. It took us 2-3 loop-dee-do’s before we landed in Iceland for my transfer. I had a short transfer so I knew I was cutting it close. Fortunately they pushed the transfer back for those of us continuing onto Munich but the process took forever. There was apparently an in-flight emergency on board which made us sit on the tarmac for an agonizing long time, particularly when you know you have to make a transfer. The “emergency” involved a couple walking off the airplane on their will, rather nonchalantly for an emergency. You’re going to save a ton of money potentially with this airline but do not be surprised if your travels are full of frustration and unpredictability.

### "my fault for missing my flight"
Denver to London via Keflavik. I bought a ticket from Denver to London flying via Icelandair for myself and my best friend, unfortunately on the day of departure, Denver airport was suffering delays across the board due to high winds. So when my connecting flight was delayed for three hours, I got to the airport with scarcely an hour before my Icelandair departure time. But luckily my friend and I managed to check in and run to the assigned gate ten minutes before departure. But instead of finding someone waiting for the two passengers that were sweating with effort to make that flight, the doors had been closed early and the gate had been abandoned. I tried everything in my power to get the attention of any gate attendant to receive assistance but I was turned away by every individual. It wasn’t until the plane was backing out of the gate (five minutes prior to the scheduled departure time) that two women representing Icelandair appeared from the gate door. I can’t say why one of them couldn’t have stayed at the gate desk to offer help to people in need but regardless, they flat out refused to help me when I asked about our flight, and told me to call Iceland directly before they walked away. I called Icelandair, waited an hour to get a hold of a representative, only to be told that it was my fault for missing my flight. I politely argued that not only were there severe delays at the Denver airport, but the plane left early. And instead of an apology, or an offer for the next flight, I was told it is a requirement to check in at the gate an hour early. I replied by saying we checked in to the airport an hour early, and it doesn’t say on my ticket, your website, or in my email confirmation to be at the gate an hour early. I suppose the customer representative realized they were conveying empty information to defend themselves against blame, and rebutted with “It is common sense to be on time for your flight.” I was so shocked that I immediately asked to talk with a supervisor. But not much to my surprise, there was no supervisor present. But I suppose in an effort to cover for their mistake, I was put on hold and then offered the next flight to London, if I would pay an extra $1,200 per ticket. And she made sure to cut me off by saying “that is all they can do” for me. I refused and asked to be compensated if they could not get me on another flight without fee. Of course, they would not refund me for my already purchased tickets at all and told me to contact the carrier for my connecting flight which had been delayed for three hours since it was their fault I missed the plane, not theirs.

### "very little leg room"
Gatwick to Toronto via Keflavik. The planes are so loud that you could permanently lose hearing on them. If you need to change your flights at all or need to get in contact with customer service, they will  ignore that you even exist. Their website says 24 hours but its definitely a lie. I have contacted them via facebook, email and their supposed 24 hour customer service line and still have received no sort of contact at all. The seats are small, very little leg room, you are literally better off flying with ryanair.

### "among my worst flying experiences"
Toronto to Frankfurt via Keflavik. The flight started well. Service was great, they had cute things for the kids, what seemed like a good entertainment system. The problem started with the delay on the ground before departure. There's nothing inherently wrong with delays, safety should come first; but we were repeatedly promised "ok 30 mins" only to have it extended to another 30 mins, and yet another 30 mins, and yet another - this attitude of miscommunication unfortunately continued throughout the entire flight experience. We were supposed to fly from Toronto to Frankfurt with a connection in Reykjavik. Unfortunately due to the long delay in Toronto, we missed our connection. Again, these things happen, the question is: How does the airline deal with it? In Icelandair's case -not well! First, upon arrival in Reykjavik, it was completely disorganized. Nobody told us where to go, even though connection times are extremely short. There were apparently 2 counters one could go to to rebook connections (about 5-10 mins from each other in the airport), but only one of them was the right one, and nobody told us which of the two to go to. So after some trial and error, we arrived at the right counter and waited for 20 mins, only to be told that we were wasting our time even in this line, because we actually were already rebooked and had to go pick up all our luggage and recheck it in. Fine, except because there's only ONE daily flight from Reyjavik to Frankfurt (unbelievable, given the hub Frankfurt is), we were rebooked on another 2-leg connection via SAS through Copenhagen instead. And SAS decided to open only a single check-in counter, despite the fact that there was a huge lineup of Icelandair passengers doing the same rerouting we were. All in all, it was a big mess, delayed multiple hours, arrived like 9-10 hours behind schedule in frankfurt, and it was all very poorly handled by Icelandair. To be fair, the tickets were much cheaper than say Lufthansa, so I can't say I fully regret it, but with kids and lots of luggage, it was probably among my worst flying experiences, and I fly often.

### "Poor communication from the airline"
Flight to London cancelled after I boarded the plane. Poor communication from the airline. When they reach high call volumes, their customer service line actually shuts down. They put me up in a poor quality hotel, and told me to come back the next day and check in at the info desk. When I did so, I was told I had to buy another flight because I missed my flight. That was not only untrue (I boarded the plane and they scanned my boarding pass) but impossible (the plane never left!). After escalating the issue, I was rebooked for later that evening. I lost a day of my vacation, paid for a hotel I couldn't stay at (non-refundable) and had to change my connecting flight (which cost me about $200). My return flight was delayed 6 hours. When we landed, the pilot decided to sit on the runway for 2 hours because it was raining and windy. That only got worse. I was supposed to have a stopover in Iceland that night and spent $145 to visit the Blue Lagoon. I was unable to go due to the delays, so I ate that expense, and my stopover consisted of sleeping in a hotel and flying out the next day. After returning home, I called their customer service and they are still "unavailable due to high call volumes". I will never use this airline again, and would not recommend using them if you have a connecting flight, or being tempted by the stopover offers. It's not worth it! Fly with a different airline. They have bitten off way more than they can chew with their marketing campaigns and cannot support the influx of tourists they are receiving even in off season! The small airport in Reykjavik is completely overloaded and disorganized.

### "company is so broken"
Chicago to Keflavik. When you shop an airfare you have choices. I would advise you to select another airline besides Icelandair. If your flight goes according to plan, you'll probably enjoy the experience. However, if anything goes wrong (and with air travel something often does), they don't stray from the script well. Their customer service is driven through their national office which is unresponsive. The only way we ever got them to respond was after going public on social media - then they respond right away. Try to the proper channels and it's radio silence. This is a company that is so broken, I would advise you to fly someone else.

### "definitely travel with them again"
Flew from Manchester to Keflavík. Check-in went smoothly with very helpful staff. The seat was surprisingly comfortable with plenty of legroom (I am 175cm tall). The Boeing 757 I was on was clearly old, but the cabin was very clean and modern. There is IFE on the flight (which is a surprise considering it is a 2 hour flight) although the selection of movies and TV shows are limited (but enough to get through the short flight). We were travelling on Icelandair’s 81st anniversary and they gave us all Icelandic sweet bread for free, which I felt is a really nice of them. Overall, I felt that the experience with Icelandair has exceeded my expectations of the company and I would definitely travel with them again.

### "everything was really good"
Keflavik to Gatwick. It was my first time flying with Icelandair, and everything was really good. I was a little upset for the high prices but it was worth of it. The plane was a B757, (strange for a 3h flight), so the seats was really confortable (I’m 193 cm tall), the crew was ready to help and with a smile. The flight was on time and the luggage arrives in LGW with no problem, the boarding was fast in KEF. The only “bad” thing (but actually it’s starting to get normal), is that we got not direct connection with Finger at the terminal in KEF, we boarded on the plane with the bus. (Really strange considering that KEF is the only hub of Icelandair). Overall Recommended!

### "Did not get my luggage"
Really unsatisfied! Did not get my luggage, poor service. Flight delayed for 5 hours. Took several days to get the luggage, and when it reached us my skis were not with. The skis are now lost somewhere and nobody knows where. No refund can cover that I was not able to use my skis during my trip. The service desk which is supposed to be 24/7 apparently is not manned, or not good enough. We waited for 1 hour as next in line (no calls ahead of us). Do not recommend.

### "the seats were not very comfortable"
Flew Chicago to Paris via Reykjavik. As a college student wanting to travel to Europe, I wanted to do it cheap, but not totally bottom shelf. I would say Icelandair is that. My flight was delayed several times, the seats were not very comfortable (very stiff with an unforgiving headrest), the staff were kind of rude (I was shoved once as an attendant was passing me in the aisle and had my arm twisted once because my elbow was in the aisle as they were trying to pass). A blanket and pillow were provided for free but no food (I didn’t even look at the options or purchase since I stocked up at the airport). A major perk was the free, good movies! The flight will get you there eventually, but there are no frills. As a college student, it was just what I was looking for, but I wouldn’t recommend this airline to anyone looking for a relaxing, seamless experience.

### "Complete joke of a company!"
Flew Icelandair from Birmingham to Reykjavik. Complete joke of a company! Our flight home was cancelled so we had to get the Manchester flight which was fine. This flight was then delayed by around an hour. When we eventually landed it took an hour for luggage to be put on to the carousel! After all this we then had to travel to Birmingham costing me and my boyfriend an extra £100! I have put in around 20 claim forms and none of them have gotten back to me. Currently speaking to someone on twitter who makes me do various tasks to get it to send and it never does! If they were genuinely concerned and wanted my needs met they would call me.

### "I would try to avoid them"
Seattle to Keflavik. Just had my worst experience ever with Icelandair, I would try everything I can to avoid them in the future. Our departure flight was cancelled and delayed by one day, so 3pm departure 7 hour flight became a 6am departure 15+ hour flight plus transfer time. When we arrived, they lost our luggage! All of them! And we are not alone, a couple of other passengers lost their luggage, too! They gave us a number to call to check the lost luggage status, I called multiple times and no one ever answered the phone! Our returning flight had an emergency landing due to airplane's mechanical/electrical problem, and the landing was at 6pm. It took 4.5 hours for them to send us to an off-airport overflow hotel. And when we were waiting for hotel arrangement in the airport, we were told that they would book re-routing flight for us, or we can book the flight ourselves and call their number to let them know, so they will cancel their re-route reservation and reimburse us. We called their number. It took 2 hours before someone answered our phone, and halfway through the conversation, the phone got dropped, then it took another hour before we were able to talk to someone again. And we were told that they will not reimburse us had we bought our own re-route flight! We were very close to buying our own at that time, because it was Dec 26, and many people were flying back from vacation so it was really hard to find any tickets at all! Eventually their airplane was fixed and we were able to return the next day. And when we arrived at our final destination airport, we found that our luggage was lost again! And we are not alone this time either. Again, they gave us a number to call. After two hour waiting time, they told us to call another number, which no one answers!

### "Awful experience!"
Awful experience! I booked round direct flights from Seattle to Reykjavik and back. They were supposed to be 6-7 hours flight each way. Everything went wrong from the beginning of the trip. The departure and return flight were delayed over 1 day and we luggage got lost twice at both arrival at Reykjavik and return to Seattle. And it took forever to get to speak to a customer rep when trying to confirm the rerouting itinerary. First time took me 2 hours (31 calls ahead of mine) to get through. Second time took me 1 hours (20 calls ahead of mine). Details on our ordeal as follows: 12/19, departure from Seattle to Reykjavik: flight cancelled due to Icelandair employee strike, we got rerouted to 16 hour itinerary. We lost over 1 day's vacation time and had to rebook all the tours in the following days. 12/21, arrival at Reykjavik airport: our luggage got lost, we had to spend the remaining day buying clothes for the tours into the cold and windy Iceland highland. At this point, we lost 2 days vacation time in total. 12/26, return from Reykjavik: plane landed in emergency in Edmonton due to electric system issue. Again no clear communication and you have to call the 1-800 number waiting for hours to figure out by yourself. We were arranged into an hotel outside the airport. Then it took me 3 hours to figure out the next day's return flight. The first rep even hang up on me! 12/27, arrival at Seattle airport: our car seat got lost again! I was totally speechless at this point. what's the odd! For my life I've taken so many flights with various airlines, never gotten luggage lost and experienced so frequent flight delays. Now I am waiting in the queue again (16 calls ahead of me) trying to get the car seat back.

### "a fairly average airline"
Reykjavik to Heathrow. Very efficient and pleasant ground staff and cabin crew. The actual plane used on the Reykjavik to Heathrow route was fine - it looked in good condition and the seats etc comfortable. Main problem was the 0755 flight departure from Reykjavik was delayed one hour, then another hour, then another hour, and when we boarded it was delayed for another 20 minutes. That was sufficient to make me miss my on-connection from Heathrow. Not happy about that! During the Icelandair flight you can buy fairly ordinary food and drinks at exorbitant prices. Recommend you take your own food and drinks, sufficient for the flight. They have a reasonable range of onboard movies, but you have to pay another exorbitant fee for a headset if you want to actually listen to the soundtrack. Not good. Overall, a fairly average airline which is more typical of in-country budget small regional airlines than a supposedly international carrier service.

### "I'm stuck at the airport"
Munich to Seattle via Keflavik. I was disappointed to learn that Icelandair no longer allows two bags to be checked in for travel from Europe to the US. I guess they are just conforming to industry norms. I was assigned middle seats the whole way, even though I booked early and checked in about 23 hours before the flight. How does that happen? Not that it matters. Today, my flight was canceled due to a strike. This might have been unavoidable, and I'm not really angry. What I am angry about is that I was not informed about the cancellation until arriving at the airport two hours before takeoff. What good are a travel alerts web site and email alerts if you can't be informed in a timely way about cancelation and rebooking? Now I'm stuck at the airport for over 5 hours until the new flight takes off. Of course, I have to wait in line for ages to deal with the rebooking. I used to be a fan of Icelandair. Now I have grave doubts.

### "worst business class seating"
Flew Icelandair from Toronto to Paris. Their business class is Saga class. The worst business class seating I have encountered. Pitch and recline are inadequate and the seats are very uncomfortable beyond one or two hours of flying. They can cut the blood circulation to your legs. Trying to find a comfortable position for sleeping during a night flight is impossible and caused me to experience leg cramps. Never again. There is no priority security clearance at Toronto Pearson airport, or at Keflavik airport. Food was OK and staff pleasant, but the airline is unsuitable for anything but short-haul day flights until they improve business class comfort and provide priority service for passengers paying the premium prices. On the return, at Keflavik we endured standing 45 minutes in a bus to go from the gate to the plane because they loaded the passengers onto the bus long before the plane was ready to receive us. This is just unacceptably poor passenger management.

### "I feel they went above and beyond"
We flew Washington Dulles to Gatwick return via Keflavik. The seats were comfortable, not too confining, and they had a good selection of food (to buy) and entertainment (free) to choose from. On the return flight, we discovered after checking in that they’d grounded all flights into KEF due to high winds. Instead of setting us adrift, Icelandair booked is into a hotel room for the day with a meal, and got us on a flight at 11.45 pm. Once we arrived in KEF, they got us a hotel room 1.5 hours away, took us there by bus, fed us an amazing breakfast while they prepared our rooms, and then got us on a shuttle back to the airport the next day, for a flight that was 24 hours later than originally booked. I feel they went above and beyond, and will definitely book them for all international flights in the future.

### "The crew service was not bad"
Flew from Washington DC to Amsterdam via Keflavik. This was the first time I have flown with Icelandair. The economy seats were wider compared to the other airlines I have flown before. The crew service was not bad. The flights were on time. The overall experience was good and is worth the fare. Only suggestion I have for them is to provide complementry food, especially on flights over 5 hours.

### "old and mostly outdated"
Flew Icelandair from Stockholm to Reykjavik. Aside from the cost, would give a negative review if possible. Many, many open seats and when asked if I could move out of a packed row into an empty row, the steward looked around, looked down her nose at me, and said, "yeah, no". International flight and the only complimentary options are tea, coffee, soda and water. Entertainment options old and mostly outdated. You get what you pay for, especially the cheap service and attitude from the staff. Save yourself the frustration and fly anybody else.

### "very relaxed crew"
Paris CDG to Newark via Keflavik. I appreciated the very relaxed crew and the comfortable seat - I had the chance to get the first row at no extra cost. But for the price paid one could have expected a little more than just a glass of water and a cup of tea on an intercontinental flight.

### "Great service and food"
Toronto to Copenhagen via Keflavik. Great service and food. Friendly staff and a bottle of water to every passenger upon embarking the plane. That sort if service is virtually unheard of in our times. I have flown with many airlines and Icelandair is one of the best companies I've flown with.

### "an unpleasant experience"
Washington to Munich via Keflavik. In the past we have used Icelandair to fly to Luxembourg and Germany. We enjoyed our experiences and recommended the carrier to family and friends. We recently returned to Germany for a visit after 20 years. We decided to use Icelandair because of the price. We traveled to Munich on October 6 and returned to Dulles on October 13. Both flights were an unpleasant experience. Both flights were late causing us to rush through customs and the terminal in Iceland to make our connecting flights. The process was stressful. There was no help from the personnel. There was no one available to guide the passengers to the fastest way to reach connecting flights or how to get through the terminal. The terminal lacked signs to direct the passengers. The terminal is too small to accommodate the size and number of flights. It is as if the carrier has sacrificed quality for quantity. When we asked for help the personnel within the terminal were short and not helpful. Stress was high for everyone involved. Older passengers were struggling to figure out which way to go to make connecting flights. Amazingly, the passengers were not rude or impatient. The flight crew were also pleasant. We have always wanted to visit Iceland and have considered it when we saw that Icelandair provides the option of staying over. This will not be an option for us if both the terminal and carrier do not improve the quality of the service. We will not recommend Icelandair to our family or friends.

### "I feel it is a complete rip off"
Manchester to Toronto via Reykjavik. Do not waste your money paying for Economy Comfort. It is advertised as having more leg room but in fact you get an economy seat. The only difference is the middle seat in a row of 3 is empty. Legroom is cramped and food offered is basic cheap airline snacks. We paid several hundred pounds extra for Economy Comfort and I feel it is a complete rip off.

### "product is way behind the times"
Keflavík to Seattle in a 757-200 in Saga Class, which is Icelandair's premium product. The brand new Saga Class lounge at Keflavík is spacious and comfortable. However, Icelandair dropped the ball on the showers facility: there is no cleaning whatsoever between showers. You enter into the mess left behind by the person who showered before you. My wife and I had to skip showering in the lounge. What in the world is Icelandair thinking? The flight itself was very pleasant. The flight attendants this time were extremely courteous and efficient, the food served excellent. That said, Icelandair's hard product is way behind the times, with their aging aircraft showing their age. Icelandair is expected to receive its first delivery of the new 737 MAX aircraft next year and one hopes the Saga Class product will be considerably enhanced at that time.

### "Service was efficient but cold"
Seattle to Keflavík in Business Class on a Boeing 757-200. Icelandair's aging aircraft are overdue for retirement. The interiors look their age, although the Saga Class cabin and bathroom were clean on this flight. The seats are wide and comfortable, but they aren't flatbed. Service was efficient but cold. Not the slightest hint of a smile throughout the flight from the matronly woman serving us. Upon landing in Keflavík, we were bundled into a bus and transported to the terminal. Saga Class passengers get no priority or comfort despite paying a premium: we were herded together with the rest until the bus overflowed. The best that can be said of Icelandair is, they don't lose your baggage.

### "will gladly use it again"
I flew Icelandair in a recent trip to Europe. Tickets are considerably less expensive than others from the West Coast to Europe. Yes, you have to stop in Iceland but the great Stopover program makes it an extended holiday. Flights were on time. Service was basic but enough with a good selection of paid dishes. Seats are not that bad. The selection of the free in-flight system was very good and they have reasonably priced internet service since you board the plane. In summary, I could not find any faults and I will gladly use it again.

### "disappointed in the food and movies offered"
Very disappointed in the food and movies offered on Icelandair. We flew on four Icelandair flights during the past two weeks. Two legs of our flights (Portland to Reykjavik, Reykjavik to Paris CDG) were in Economy-Comfort Class. The other two (Zurich to Reykjavik, Reykjavik to Portland) were in Economy Class. Icelandair does not offer any complimentary small packages of crackers, peanuts, pretzels, etc, they only offer complimentary soft drinks in small cups (not whole beverage cans). The food Icelandair offers on board is limited and extremely expensive (compared to what other airlines, like Alaska or Delta, charge on US flights). The food service on Icelandair Economy-Comfort isn't much better, same limited menu, albeit free of charge. As to the choice of on board movies, we ran out of movies to watch, also some of the movies listed were way outdated and we had seen them before. Lastly, KEF airport has no walking-sidewalks, so the walk from Check-In to our gate was very long, and there was no seating area next to our gate yesterday (D31): we had to stand for over 40 minutes waiting for our flight to board! Now that we have fallen for Icelandair's widely advertised complimentary stopover in Reykjavik, we see no reason for us to use Icelandair for travel between the US and Europe. Delta airlines provides a much better service, complimentary snacks, lunch, dinner, wine, beer, and nice warm towels on flights between the US and Europe. Also Delta's flights are shorter (from PDX), and are cheaper (as of my recent Expedia search shows).

### "I had an enjoyable experience"
Flew Icelandair between London Heathrow and Iceland return during August. This was our first flight with Icelandair. Check in was fast and efficient on both legs. Good legroom on both flights with comfortable seating. My only complaint was that you needed to pay for food on an international flight. Water and soft drinks were supplied but when I asked for a coke instead of giving me the entire small can they only poured an amount into the cup. Seriously - I've heard about cost cutting but this is too much. Having said that I had an enjoyable experience and certainly would fly Icelandair again

### "total run around from Icelandair"
Keflavik to Portland. I got a total run around from Icelandair when I reached out to them for help with my outbound flight. The customer service was very unhelpful and uncompassionate. They were not accommodating to my disability. On the return flight the gate was total mayhem - unorganized, crowded, and inefficient. The flight was an hour late leaving due to this inefficiency. My seat was then broken and wouldn't recline at all. When I brought it up to the flight attendant at the beginning of the flight I was told basically "we will just have to fix it later". No sorry, no offer for a new seat, no compensation for my troubles - nothing. Also - no meals are included for international flights, even when they are 6+ hours long.

### "not fly with Icelandair again"
Seattle to Helsinki via Keflavik. The flight itself wasn't too bad. The seats were fine and the crew was friendly enough. However, there's wasn't even nuts or pretzels offered during the flight. Only one cup of juice during the 6 hour flight. I would have gladly paid for a meal but they wouldn't take cash in the flight. And during my 18 hour layover in Iceland I couldn't even get one meal voucher. I wasn't asking for much just one meal to help hold me until my final destination. All the other airlines I've flown with have offered this for layovers that were less than this one. Sadly, I've come to the decision to not fly with Icelandair again.

### "crews were really nice and patient"
Washington to Helsinki via Keflavik. The flight crews were really nice and patient. The 6 hour flights had better planes than the 3 hour one from Keflavik to Helsinki and back. We got an old plane coming back from Helsinki, but a new one from Keflavik to DC. The food you had to pay for. Kind of mediocre, but that is airline food. Got a ham and cheese baguette at Keflavik  airport. I assume it is the same as that served on plane. Fills you up, but that is it. No lost baggage and almost on time.

### "treated like a human being"
Chicago to Gatwick return via Keflavik. The check in personnel were very friendly and didn't nickle and dime you due to the weight of check in bags. The seats were in my opinion really comfortable in terms of width and seat pitch. The padding isn't the greatest but you could move in the seat. I wasn't expecting anything spectacular on the service front from a pretty bare bones airline but I was treated like a human being.

### "We were packed in like sardines"
Flew Reykjavik to Portland. I would agree with the past two reviewers. The airport at Reykjavik is dangerously overcrowded. After spending a very uncomfortable several hours in the airport, we were bussed to our airplane. Then, the plane sat on the ground for another hour while some kind of engine problem was fixed. It was unavoidable, and we did want to have it fixed, but the crew could have done a better job keeping us informed and perhaps doing something to ameliorate the "hurt". We flew economy. We were packed in like sardines. The food offerings available for purchase were hideously expensive and perfectly awful. So, if you fly Icelandair after reading this review and are not willing to pay for business class, be sure to bring your own food and drink onboard. (The wine was pretty bad, too). I would also suggest purchasing your own earphones at home, rather than relying on those available on-board. There were not enough flight attendants to be able to serve the full airplane in a very timely fashion, though they were very pleasant and tried to be helpful. I would love to be able to return to Iceland, but I'm not sure I could face another flight on this airline or through this airport.

### "not fly with Icelandair again"
Amsterdam to Montreal via Keflavik. I used to fly IcelandAir all the time. It was a good way to get to Europe to visit family and friends. Unfortunately this last trip was horrible. No gates, just a hallway with no seats. On our leg from Keyflavik to Montreal there were five gates within 40 feet of one another. All five gates has flights leaving at exactly the same time (or within 5 minutes of one another). The hall was full with hundreds of passengers, none of who could sit as it was a hall and the four seats were quickly taken. There was no indication on the electronic signs as to when the gate was to open. When an agent did finally arrive there were no announcements. She just opened up the gate and people rushed to get further on their trip. I don't mind taking a bus and climbing a stair on a flight, but nowhere during our booking were we told that Icelandair doesn't provide any food on their flights. You have to buy anything you want. Even the cabin crew didn't explain this. My wife and I, who used to fly Iceland Air all of the time, were shocked that we got through our six hour flight and no food was served. We then realized that we were supposed to buy the food. Well thanks. I'll just bring a picnic instead of spending $10 on a cup of yogurt. I must say the whole gate thing was the worst. Each airport that I used with Icelandair with the exception of Montreal (YUL) had the same problem. No seats, no good announcements (except at AMS). If you want someone to be at the gate early to ensure they are there make sure there is somewhere for them to sit, and room enough so they are not all crowded together. I used to love this airline but it seems that they have expanded their flight capacity but not their terminal capacity. Shame on them for selling these flights! Figure it out first so we have a comfortable experience from start to finish. I'll not fly with Icelandair again and I hate saying that because I used to fly them all of the time.

### "Never again Icelandair"
Stockholm to Boston via Keflavik. Never flying with them again! Planes are old and uncomfortable, each one of the four legs on my journey was late. No gate at KEF, (had to use buses from terminal and the driver admitted he had no idea which plane was ours or the destination), an inability to print boarding passes for both legs in Stockholm, Snooty gate agent service was my reward for spending $1,000 to simply get what was promised. Only bright spot is onboard staff were friendly and helpful. Never again Icelandair.

### "no more reasons for flying Icelandair"
Boston to Munich via Keflavik. I have flown Icelandair for many years, from back when it still was Loftleidir, always between the U.S. and Europe. My last flight was in May 2017. For my next trip I shall choose another airline. I picked Icelandair, usually flying "comfort Economy", because it offered a bit more space between rows and, with the middle seat of a 3-seat group blocked, more room between passengers. With the arrival of the larger efficient Boeings for the transatlantic legs comfort has vanished. For the price of Comfort Economy you now have the pleasure of sitting cramped towards the front of the plane on narrow, uncomfortable seats in the same slave-ship configuration most other airlines use. The aisles have become narrower. Given that stopovers at Keflavik are chaotic because there simply is not enough terminal space to handle simultaneous departures, I have no more reasons for flying Icelandair. Whatever made that airline attractive is gone.

### "changed to standby"
Washington to Gatwick via Keflavik. Gate agent was of no help at Washington Dulles. My reservation and seat assignment in Premium Economy was unbeknownst to me changed to standby. I was told by the agent the flight was full. Luckily his coworker addressed my situation in a very professional manner by giving me an upgrade to Saga class and a pass to the Air France lounge.

### "happy to fly Icelandair again"
Keflavik to London. First flight with a refurbished Boeing 767 was an uneventful affair. You can't really blame Icelandair for the chaos of KEF airport, that is completely overflowing with passengers and the bad original design is showing. What would be nice is not having to take a bus to a plane. But the weather was nice this morning so it was just fine. I just wonder how they deal with mobile impaired passengers. Icelandair is an efficient if not spectacular airline. Fairly dependable when you have any issues and I'd pick them over a budget option. The 767 is one of the nicer planes in the fleet. There's good legroom, great screen, sufficient entertainment and wifi on board. Icelanders don't seem to have the ability to smile a lot and it shows when you're getting service here. It's cool and maybe that just goes with the country. But it's fairly efficient and it's not unfriendly. Actually if you have any special needs the staff go out of their way to help you. Food and alcohol is for sale, but plenty of water on offer. The flight was over quickly enough and we arrived on time. Would be happy to fly with Icelandair again.

### "the service was excellent"
During May and June 2017 my wife and I took 4 flights with Icelandair. These were Heathrow - Keflavik - Vancouver and Halifax - Keflavik - Heathrow. LHR-KEF, Sunday 21/05/17, KEF–YVR, Tuesday 23/05/17, YHZ–KEF, Thursday 22/06/17, KEF-LHR, Sunday 25/06/17. The check in on each occasion was good and we were greeted warmly and quickly. The lounges which we used (Halifax does not have a lounge) were good and sufficient for one’s needs. My wife and I normally travel long haul with Emirates and did not know what to expect from Icelandair in-flight service – we need not worried as on each leg the service was excellent and the cabin staff were extremely helpful and extremely pleasant. The food – which we had pre-ordered from the online menu – was well presented. It is worth noting that the total air miles we flew was 7945 and each Saga Class ticket cost £2044 which equates to £0.26 pence per mile which we consider to be excellent value for money.

### "there is ample legroom"
As a European living in the US, I travel between the two continents several times a year. After trying a number of different airlines and routes, I now always use Icelandair. I book Economy Comfort, but due to the Saga Silver status that I have acquired I often get free upgrades to Saga Class, which is Icelandair's Business Class. Icelandair still awards miles based on the distance traveled, which means that the 40,000 miles required for Silver status accumulate fairly fast. This is a review of a recent trip from Frankfurt to Boston via Keflavik in Saga Class. The comfort in Saga Class is perfectly sufficient for my needs: the seats are wide, recline a fair bit, and there is ample legroom. Every Saga traveler gets a pillow, blanket, and amenity kit. Service is friendly. The meals consist of Icelandic specialties, such as lamb and fish. They are quite tasty. The selection of alcoholic drinks is sufficient, but nothing to write home about. Inflight entertainment is very good, with an excellent selection of music. (I don't watch inflight movies.) I couldn't get the Wifi to work. The stopover in Keflavik adds an hour or two to the flight, to be sure, but I appreciate the opportunity to walk around and stop by the excellent Saga Lounge. Admittedly, Keflavik airport has become somewhat chaotic. It was clearly not designed for all the Icelandair and Wow flights that are clustered around the early morning and late afternoon. Many planes have to be boarded and boarded on the tarmac, far from the terminal. The waiting areas are absolutely packed, and to make matters worse premium passengers board with everyone else. In sum, Icelandair Saga Class provides a reasonably priced comfortable journey between Europe and the US. Reflecting the spirit of Iceland itself, Saga Class is not excessively luxurious, but I have always been satisfied with the amenities and service provided. Finally, as an added bonus, Icelandair flights between Keflavik and Boston fly over south Greenland. If you keep the blinds open and the weather is good, you will see an amazing island.

### "their service has improved"
Helsinki to Toronto via Keflavik. I have flown Icelandair several times in the past and their service has improved, but business practices have not. Helsinki to Keflavik I was seated in the equivalent of their business class seating on a premium economy ticket. The staff were much friendlier than they had been in the past. The food was okay, with quite a limited selection and not very filling. We were offered food and drink once and then crew disappeared for a long time while empty cups and trays laid on our trays waiting to be collected. Keflavik to Toronto I was in an economy seat but with marginally more legroom and a closed off seat between me and the passenger next to me. In the end the proximity of the seat to the door enabled me to be the first one off the plane once it had landed, but the entire flight I was directly across from the lavatory door, just a couple of feet away. Icelandair is still involved in hard-selling stays in Iceland. I have vacationed there before and it is truly a one of a kind place, but I find being constantly subjected to sales pressure very wearing. Even the safety video is a thinly disguised travelogue. Ultimately, Icelandair is a good value in terms of its routes, but they tend to charge you the maximum and give the minimum in return. Check out their change fees, some of the highest in the industry. Their inflight entertainment is exceptionally good. The selection of music is far and away the best I have ever seen.

### "Unbelievably poor service"
Unbelievably poor service. 10 hour delay on flight out of Keflavik to Glasgow. To make matters worse, we were made to go to a gate, made to carry our bags upstairs, then left in a room with 2 staff who didn't talk to anyone. Then one by one we started to get emails telling us that the flight had been delayed. We then had to queue up to talk to the staff member who told us we then had to carry our bags back down the stairs and across the airport to go to the Service Desk as he couldn't tell us anything.. We then had to ask for meal vouchers as they weren't provided and i know many passengers who didn't know to ask so had to spend their own money. If only they had had the decency to make a announcement, rather than hide behind an email and then give us all the information and vouchers without having to queue up so many times. There was really no feeling from the staff, they really didn't care than our flight was almost 10 hours late.

### "Very disappointing experience"
Washington to Gatwick via Reykjavik. Very disappointing experience all the way around. This trip involved four flights, every single one was delayed at least 90min. The first was delayed over three hours (that we spent sitting on the tarmac), causing me to miss my connection. They routed me the next day, so I was more than 24hrs late to my final destination. I asked about another airline or a different airport in London, and they refused to help. They were rude to everyone. And this was all because of problems with their plane, not weather or anything. My rebooked, day later connecting flight was delayed an hour because the plane was late coming in, again because of mechanical issues. We then sat on the tarmac for awhile beyond that, and no one ever told us why. Flight from Gatwick back to Reykjavik was about an hour late leaving, again hanging out on the tarmac with no information. And now I'm back in the airport, waiting to try to get home, and just got a message that this flight is delayed 90min. I'm guessing that is if we are lucky. They never tried to make it up on the first flight, not offering complimentary food or headphones or anything. I will try to avoid ever flying this airline again.

### "blown away by our experience"
This was my wife's and my first time flying Icelandair from Boston to Frankfurt via Reykjavik. We have frequenty flown with other airlines all over the world (so we have lots of flights to compare with). I read some of the previous reviews (after having already purchasing my tickets). I must admit that I was concerned due to the mostly bad reviews. I was blown away by our experience from Boston to Frankfurt via Reykjavik. We were aware that meals / snacks would need to be purchased if wanted so that was not a surprise. Unlimited non alcoholic drinks were available at no charge. We were on four different flights with Icelandair to get to and from our destination. The staff from check-in to exiting our flight were all extremely competent and very friendly. The planes were spotlessly clean (maybe in part from not having all the mess from partially eaten meals as on other airlines). Flights were held so that late arriving passengers could make their connection. Luggage arrived on time. Be sure to bring your earphones with you if you don't want to purchase a set. Movies, TV shows and travel shows about Iceland were available. Video screens were new, and worked well. The had easy plug in spots on the screens for charging electronics. We would definitely fly Icelandair again.

### "not ready for the big league"
Icelandair is not ready for the big league. Three of four segments from Milan to Portland via Reykjavik required us to depart or enter the plane on the tarmac and take a bus. Reykjavik airport is a mess with construction and detours that change from day to day. The staff is over worked and stressed. Our flight crew was late causing an hour delayed departure to Milan. The result was we missed the last shuttle to our hotel so a 30 Euro taxi ride was incurred. Of the 4 Icelandair flight segments three were delayed and we had to rush through the Reykjavik terminal to get to our Portland flight which was also delayed. The Icelandair business strategy appears to be "sell the tickets and we'll figure out how to make the flight later".

### "won't use Icelandair again"
Minneapolis to Reykjavik. Tickets were purchased for my wife, my 7r old son and myself online at Icelandair's website. During the process one of the field reads "adult". This is the only option to choose no matter what age you are. My son was obviously not an adult as reflected in his age listed on the same page. His booking was separate from ours so my wife called to make sure this was not an issue and if they should be combined. The Icelandair rep said no. It was just fine. While checking in I saw that Icelandair gives 25% off to children my son's age. I called and asked for this discount and they said "No, you booked him as an adult" I asked them how there was any other option and they said we needed to call them directly to book a child's ticket.I pointed out that we spoke with a rep the same day and they said nothing. They said it was our problem. They also said they don't sell solo tickets for children online. There is nothing telling you that you have to call and no indication that there is any other option but "adult" during the process. You can buy a solo ticket for a child on their website because of their misdirection. I was repeatedly told this was not their problem and they don't do partial refunds. No answer was given when asked both questions. Why was I able to buy a single ticket for a 7yr old at your website and Why is there nothing telling me I have to call to book a child's ticket? I've flown everyone around the world. This was the worst customer service experience to date. 200$ would have been the amount refunded to me. My family won't use Icelandair again.

### "I will never fly Icelandair"
I will never fly Icelandair after my latest experience. Instead of a general critique, Here is a very recent story. In fact, we're still currently rolling around the DFW airport on the plane looking for the gate, and have been for the last hour. My wife and I were in a position to have an overnight layover on the way home from a European vacation. I was clicking around to see what would get us home the quickest. Then I saw a flight that had an overnight in Iceland (Munich to Dallas via Keflavik). I figured, how about a relaxing evening in the blue lagoon? This might turn out to be the worst decision I've made in years. So, initially we have a 1 hour delay because Icelandair forgot to clean the toilets. Funny, but little did we know that was a metaphor for our next two days. When we landed, we could see them trying to line up the ramp with the plane to let us off. After failing to seal anywhere even close to the door several times, they ended up changing drivers for the ramp! This took about 20 minutes. Then our bags ended up on the wrong turn style, and despite what the stewardess said, they weren't even supposed to come out at all! At this point we were unimpressed, but still ready to enjoy what was left of our evening. That's when I remembered I hadn't turned my phone off of airplane mode, so as we finished going through security gates I switched it off. Blinking, waiting to be read, was a text message from Icelandair. It was Informing us that our flight had been rescheduled to 5:40 pm that day. Current time? 6:10. We never had a chance. Needless to say, we never saw anything in Iceland other than our hotel, and I spent hours trying to get our flight rescheduled. The next day was less unusual, but equally irritating, just gate changes last minute, a 2 hour delay, riding around the tarmac in a bus. Missing our connecting flight, etc. Instead of being home tonight we're at DFW 4 hours late, and have spent 2 hours driving around looking for a gate. Icelandair dismisses the entire experience as a minor schedule change.

### "it was well worth it"
Flew Icelandair from Seattle to Keflavik. The seats aren't very comfortable - my fleece ended up being a seat cushion - and the 3 and 3 seating arrangement is a bit tortuous on a 6.5 hour flight, but for $450 round-trip from Seattle, a lot of sins can be forgiven. Unlike WOW, you get wifi, in-flight seatback entertainment, free non-alcoholic drinks, and can carry on a standard American-sized roller bag without any hassle. The check-in agents in Seattle were great, told me it wasn't a full flight, and moved me into a row with nobody in the middle seat. There was a large tour group on the flight out, and the flight crew patiently and efficiently helped them move seats without disrupting the whole plane. Had a full row flying back, but check-in and the flight itself were fine. I brought my own food both times, so I can't comment on the offerings, but the mixed-drinks deals were pretty good, and the in-flight entertainment fine if you're just looking for something to pass the time. All in all, it was well worth it for a five day weekend trip. Flying them again in a few weeks with a checked bag, so maybe I'll have a horror story then.

### "Promises so far have been broken"
Departing flight Washington to Munich via Keflavik was uneventful. The luggage of a good portion of the passenger however did not arrive. Resulted in long lines/long wait to enter a claim for the lost luggage. This can happen, 4 days later I finally have my luggage. This was the easy part of my travel. Return flight Munich to Reykjavik to Washington. I checked in and was at the boarding gate more than 2 hours before departure. Flight was a little delayed. During boarding I was told to step aside with no explanation. Plan was boarded, and my inquiries about what is going on was rudely pushed aside and threatened with security. Boarding finished and the plane with my luggage left without me. Now the attended took the time to find out what was going on. A Icelandair staff rebooked me without my consent on another flight and another Airline (Lufthansa) from another terminal. No explanation was given on why and how could that be. No one thought about letting me know, even though I was checked in and sitting at the boarding gate for more than 2 hours. Everybody confused at this point. Plane is leaving in 45 min. How to get me there, through security etc. I was checked in to the Lufthansa flight via phone, but otherwise no help was given except showing me the walkway to the other end of the terminal and the gate location (gate 22 or so where the bus would take me to terminal 2). I was told to better run otherwise I would miss this flight. Running down that hallway turned out to end up at a restricted area, was rerouted by a security officer, finally arriving at the given gate for the bus only to find a sign that stated the bus is no longer leaving from there. Needed to go half way back to gate 8, finally waiting for the bus, making it to terminal 2, making it through the checkpoints and getting to the last one for LH only to be told they can't let me through, my flight just left. Now being told to go to LH Customer Service, arriving sweating, shaking and exhausted (LH Staff is great, arranging for the next flight out on United Airlines, arranging for a Hotel for the night (paid via Islandair- small token), they took care off all the communication with Iceland air. They told me how to get best back to Terminal one to yet again file a lost baggage claim with Icelandair as my luggage went with my original flight without me (against security regulations). Finally get on the United Airline flight the next morning, however, arriving yet again without luggage. I filed a claim two weeks ago, for reimbursement of expenses due to continued lost luggage and partial reimbursement of my original flight (as it is against passenger protection to rebook after check-in without passengers consent). All I have on a response so far is an automated response that the claim has been received. Via phone I am told I can't speak to a Customer Service Representative in regards to my claim and that the claim has not yet been assigned. Promises of a response so far have been broken.

### "Icelandair has not been responsive"
Washington to Zurich via Reykjavik. I coordinate high school exchange programs. I inquired with Icelandair in November 2016 for a group of students who would be headed to Europe in April 2017. We received the initial quote for a flight from Washington DC to Reykjavik to Zurich. The price was great and I had flown twice before on Icelandair without problems. So I had no hesitation in booking our group with them. I posted a deposit for the seats in November, with final payment due in February. I sent our final payment in early February. Mid-February we were issued tickets. And then twice weeks later (March), we were informed that the flight from Reykjavik to Zurich was being cancelled (no reason was given). But they were going to rebook the group on a new flight from Reykjavik to Munich and then Munich to Zurich. I shared with our group sales person that this was nuts and that this extra flight would cause the students to miss their adjoining connections. I was repeatedly told by Icelandair that their only obligation was to reschedule us on a legal flight (with no regard for the other transportation reservations I had already made and paid for to get the groups to their final destinations). And 45 minutes to deboard a full plane in Munich and then get to the next gate for their final flight to Zurich was really tight. To their credit, our students arrived on time to Zurich. However, none of their suitcases were at Zurich airport when they arrived. They waited in a long line with others to file their lost luggage claims. Which caused the group headed to Austria to miss their next flight from Zurich to Vienna. And which caused the students headed on a train to France to miss their appointed train departure. Swiss Air (who would take the students from Zurich to Vienna) wanted to charge the group full fares again for the flight because they missed their original flight (not due to their fault, of course). After arguing with them, they relented and divided the group up into two sections, with half flying out on a flight one hour later. And the remainder of the students, flying out two hours later. For the students headed to France, we had to repurchase the train tickets because they would not honor the original tickets since they missed their train. Most of the students received their suitcases at their host families two days later. One teacher and another student did not get their suitcase until 3 days later. We thought "Okay, it was problematic going over. We should have no problems going back. Wrong! Through no fault of Icelandair, the weather was bad on the flight back to the U.S. and the students were stranded in Reykjavik for two more days. I would like to thank Icelandair for putting up the group in a hotel and with all meals covered for those two days. But I was in disbelief that they told the teacher that she had to call a phone number and reschedule the group onto new flights. Shouldn't the airline and ticket counter have taken care of this? Hours later and $40 in cell phone charges, the teacher finally went from number 98 in the queue to 1 to get the group rescheduled. Upon the return home (April 19), one girl had her suitcase lost. Icelandair has not been responsive to phone calls or emails. And I am still waiting for Icelandair to reimburse me for the purchase of new train tickets and for reimbursing the teacher for toiletries and a long distance phone charges. 3 stars for the stay in Iceland. 0 for everything else.

### "value was not that great"
Flew Reykjavik to Toronto. Delayed by 45 minutes (for both my flights with Icelandair). They did not provide any meal or snacks for a 6 hour flight (actually 7 hours with the delay). Inflight entertainment had no good selection, very outdated movies and limited selection. Airline also interrupted my entertainment several times to sell their products. Value was not that great since it was more expensive than other similar flights from other airlines.

### "a dismal experience"
Seattle to Keflavík roundtrip in Saga Class, Icelandair's premium product. The only reason to fly Icelandair is because the alternatives to get to Iceland from the West coast of the USA are worse. The only redeeming feature of Icelandair is, they are mostly on time and they don't lose your baggage. Other than that, the airline does not do anything to make the premium paying passenger experience pleasant or less unpleasant. At Keflavík airport, which is a zoo these days, there is no separate security screening line for Saga Class. At the Saga Lounge, vegetarians have very limited options. The aircraft are old, cabins are unkempt and the toilets dirty. The Saga Class seats are from the silent movie era. Coffee is served in paper cups, and those with dietary restrictions are out of luck if you forget to pre-order a special meal. All in all, Icelandair is a dismal experience.

### "kept delaying flights"
Paris to Denver via Keflavik. Icelandair kept delaying flights and ended up cancelling. They sent around a worker handing out vouchers for dinner at 10pm saying our crew was on the way and then cancelled 30 minutes later without an announcement. We noticed our flight wasn't on the screen and had to wait another 2 hours in a line to get a hotel. Now we're in the hotel line going on an hour.

### "staff were so friendly"
Flew Icelandair from Glasgow to Keflavik. Fantastic flight from start to finish, got a perfect seat with extra legroom for no extra charge, selected online before departure. Staff were so friendly and couldn't do enough for us! The inflight entertainment system on the 2 hour flight was a great bonus, overall I thoroughly enjoyed my flight and will definitely use the airline in the future as I could of easily stayed on the aircraft for another 5/6 hours!

### "Everyone was sitting on the floor"
Boston to Reykjavik. The flying part was fine. Thank goodness for that. But when we arrived at Keflavik we sat on the runway a long time waiting for what the captain referred to as our "parking space. After several updates saying we were about to dock, he then started driving around the airport looking for another "parking space. On the way back, we got to our gate and there were no chairs! None. Everyone was sitting on the floor! After a while, with no announcement, we noticed a very slow-moving line had formed. It turned out to be a line for buses. Which came, like, one every 15 minutes. Also, on both occasions in Keflavik, there were alarms going off in the terminal that sounded like smoke alarms.

### "staff very helpful and friendly"
London Heathrow to Denver via Keflavik with Icelandair. The flights were excellent and the inflight entertainment was very good. Staff were friendly and helpful. Due to ATC problems at KEF, the flight left LHR two hours late and I missed my connection to DEN, but the service desk staff were very helpful and were able to get me onto the next flight the day after and a hotel room for the night free of charge. The flight to DEN left about two hours late due to the aforementioned ATC problems. In conclusion, the staff were all very helpful and friendly, even in circumstances beyond their control and the in flight entertainment was excellent.

### "my first and last trip on Icelandair"
❎ Unverified |  Never had flown them before a week-long trip to Iceland. Initially thought I'd been thrown into time warp of flying Pan Am, with flight attendants dressed up, wearing pill box hats, tons of make up and high heels. But that's where the service ended. I'd been told by friends that Iceland people tend to be more reserved, and found this to be true with the flight attendants. There was no warmth or helpfulness, just a perfunctory manner of handing out the drinks in a somewhat cool and detached manner. It is somewhat surprising to be on an 8-hour flight and receive only a soft drink, not even a meal or a snack. I can't think of another airlines who doesn't serve complimentary food on a flight that long. We didn't even get peanuts or pretzels. Also, the seats are very uncomfortably hard for such a long flight. I found myself trying to stretch just to keep my back side from going numb. This combined with the chaos that is Keflavik airport will probably mean this is my first and last trip on Icelandair.

### "Not impressed at all"
I traveled from Toronto to Munich via Keflavik in Economy Class by Icelandair. Not impressed at all and will not recommend to others. Paid for ticket 800CAD and was surprised to learn that they don't offer complimentary food. My friends flew by Air Canada (same route Toronto-Munich) and were offered food twice- dinner and breakfast, and also complimentary wine. Even if I wanted to buy their food on board the selection was very very limited. Poor entertainment on board- total 20 movies, 6 of them were for kids, 14 for adults for all genres, headphones - only for purchase. Finally, my luggage was delayed by 2 days. No Icelandair representative at Munich airport as they don't want to pay for the desk at the airport, very poor service. Felt that they heavily rely on tourists to support economy but fail to provide adequate service to match the cost.

### "this is not business class"
New York JFK to Paris via Keflavik. I was warned that you get what you pay for and the benefit is the stopover so I wasn't expecting the level of service you would see with other airline. The staff were efficient albeit not overly friendly. The aircraft was clean and the service was good. There are 20 movies at most and all but 1 were ancient ones. The food choice was limited but good. The issue is that this is really premium economy and not business class. The seats are cramped and on top of one another. There is virtually no recline and it felt like sitting on a brick. The person in front of you is in your lap. It was as uncomfortable as the seats on a regional jet. The free stopover is the only reason to take this flight. If you want true business class it is not found on Icelandair.

### "I was quite impressed"
I flew to London Heathrow from Edmonton return via Keflavik in  Economy Class. I was quite impressed with Icelandair and will fly with them again. Flying time from Edmonton to Keflavik is just over 6 hours and Keflavik to London is just under 3 hours. I was well aware that there was not going to be food served so I was proactive and brought a lunch with me. On the way home you can always buy a few wraps or a sandwich at the airport. In my case i did pre purchase the ham and cheese baguette from the Saga Kitchen which was tasty but over priced. FAs' very friendly. Aircraft were clean, and modern. Boeing 767 from LHR to KEF was excellent. Newly refurbished plane with big modern IFE. My only complaint is that of the gate staff at KEF. Very poor communication and they appeared to not really know what was going on. In my case my flight going into LHR from KEF was delayed and there was very little communication from the gate staff as she did not appear to know what was going on nor did she give the impression that she cared.

### "the attitude is very bad"
I traveled from London to Keflavik return in February with Icelandair. The cabin crew was not friendly or helpful - actually rude, very cold and indifferent. The cabin crew look smart in their uniforms but the attitude is very bad.

### "Would not fly them again"
New York JFK to Keflavik return. The plane appeared to be new with very uncomfortable leather seats. It was like sitting on a rock for 5 hours. The flight was entirely in the dark. Only once were we served a beverage, no coffee before landing in spite of having flown all night. The cabin crew were all well turned out with make-up, hair and nails looking professionaly done and smart uniforms which they seem not to want to get dirty. But not friendly or helpful. We couldn't hear the PA messages, what few there were. Very cold and indifferent. The whole thing repeated itself on return trip. Most cabin crews go the distance to be helpful and especially friendly. There was also no thank you for flying with us as we left the plane. I also have been screened for and received my KTN. Icelandair is too cold and indifferent to participate in the program. Would not fly them again and don't recommend them.

### "does exactly what it says on the tin"
I travelled with Icelandair from 30/01/2017 - 12/02/2017 from Manchester to Toronto via Keflavik with a 3 night stopover in Iceland on route. Overall I cannot fault Icelandair as the product they have is good value for money and does exactly what it says on the tin. The flight cost me £270.00 return for economy and did everything that I expected. It was on time, efficient and comfortable with friendly staff all around. I did have my booking amended after I booked due to a flight withdrawal but it was quick and easy when I called them to change, the agent just asked when I would like to travel back and changed my booking there and then without hassle. Onboard, their aircraft are in good shape and they offer 1 3 class config with saga (buisness) class at the front then economy comfort and economy behind. I was sat in seats 10A (MAN-KEF), 16F (KEF-YYZ), 10A (YYZ-KEF) and 16F(KEF-MAN). Seats 10A are convertible seats that can be both economy or economy comfort and I was lucky to have the middle seat free each time I was sat there so could slide the armrest across to give me a bit more space(there is a catch below the armrest that adjusts its position. There is slightly more legroom than normal economy seats. Seats 16F are over wing emergency exit seats so had loads of legroom, however the only downside is the armrest is immoveable as the tray table is stored in it so you cannot make the seat wider, however on both occasions I was sitting there there was nobody next to me. Icelandair have a fantastic product for the price I paid as you get free non alcoholic drinks in economy and a good selection of movies and TV programmes on the IFE, and even better, I had 2x23kg baggage allowance for travelling to/from north America. If you do want something to eat you have the option to pre order and pay before travel or buy onboard, just be aware they operate a cashless system onboard so only accept card payments. Overall Icelandair are highly recommended and I will travel with them again.

### "probably fly with them again"
Birmingham to Keflavik return with Icelandair. Whilst the staff on board weren’t unpleasant they certainly didn’t go out of their way to make it a particularly memorable flight. They did what was required of them and dealt with any necessary questions but that was it. The announcements weren’t that clear (although that could have been hampered by the noise of the passengers) and I was surprised no safety demonstrations were given, just spoken instructions and told to read the “in case of emergency” card in the pocket in front of you. On the return flight, F1494 Keflavik to Birmingham on Friday 28/10/2016, there was a male member of the cabin crew and he seemed far more willing to assist passengers than the female cabin crew did. One late arriving passenger wanted to be seated with her companion so they asked if there were any empty seats that they could move to? As there was only one vacant seat the male member of staff asked if a few people would be willing to swap seats so the late arrival could sit with their companion and after a brief game of musical chairs the problem was happily sorted out, whilst the female cabin crew just watched and gave an appearance of being unapproachable. As for the seats, they are narrow and not especially comfortable and if you’re in an aisle seat you get the added problem of the cabin crew knocking in to you as they go up and down the plane as the aisle isn’t that wide either. I wouldn’t say Icelandair was the best company I’ve flown with but they weren’t the worst and I’d probably fly with them again but maybe not on a long haul flight.

### "for a short distance it is fine"
London to Reykjavik. I bought tickets for myself and partner as it was cheap. As it was only a three hour flight, and I have no issues with the airline. I wouldn't want to fly more than five hours with them, however for a short distance it is fine. If you are that way inclined, you can buy food. But inflight entertainment and water, juice, tea and coffee are provided for free.

### "a pleasant and welcoming atmosphere"
Frankfurt to Toronto via Keflavik, on January 13th in Saga Class. This was an enjoyable flight overall. We left Frankfurt about 45 minutes late, due to poor weather that morning. The connection times at Keflavik are very short, so I was concerned my bags might not make it. When they showed up on the carousel in Toronto, I was pleasantly surprised. Icelandair seems to run an efficient operation at Keflavik. As many travelers have already pointed out on this website, Icelandair's Saga Class corresponds roughly to what one would expect in a domestic (US) first-class cabin. The seats are large and quite comfortable, but do not recline more than just a bit. There is one tiny bathroom for the entire Saga Class cabin. On the upside, the food can be quite good, especially on flights departing Iceland. Thus, between Keflavik and Toronto I was served a very nice fish stew. The flight attendants were very friendly, making for a pleasant and welcoming atmosphere. The entertainment system offered a good selection of music (including lots of Icelandic records, quite interesting for those who want to educate themselves a bit) on the movie side, I noticed a lot of older titles. In sum, Icelandair's Saga Class seems like a good choice for those who like a break in their transatlantic travel and want a reasonable degree of comfort for a competitive price.

### "definitely not be using them again"
My husband and I flew from Glasgow to Toronto via Reykjavik. We bought the tickets through Skyscanner with standard meals clearly stated as included in the ticket, however the cabin staff told us that we need to pay for food. After long conversation with the supervisor we managed to get some food (2 salads even though we asked for something else and the stewards made sure in a very rude manners that we won't get another meal on the next flight). I found the comment unbelievable rude, during our conversation I have been asked what is a standard meal because they do not know what is that. I never flew with an airline where you need to pay for the headphones. One of the passengers had to remind the crew for the immigration papers before landing as they were to busy chatting. We will definitely not be using them again.

### "not be using them again"
Glasgow to Reykjavik return. Thankfully only a short flight, the seats are very uncomfortable (budget airline standard). I found one of the stewards quite rude not just to us but also to another passenger who reacted to her the way I wish I had! We boarded a bus to the aircraft then we were left standing on the bus for about 5 mins with the doors closed as clearly they were not ready for us to board - when we did board there wasn't a steward to be seen. Then we sat waiting for 30 mins as the luggage had not been put onboard! When we arrived at Glasgow we started to get off, then the stewards remembered that non EU passengers needed to complete a card - so we were standing in the aisle waiting for these to be handed out (surely these things should be done during the flight). As we started to move the cabin staff put her hand out to stop us as people from the front (I assume these were Icelandair's version of business class passengers (who seemed to be seated in seats other airlines put economy passengers in separated by a curtain) were departing. I found this unbelievable that fare paying passengers are stopped by a raised hand - a gesture I find completely rude. I have flown with a budget airline and knew what to expect with them due to the cost of the flight and I would use them again. However I feel this flight with icelandair only differed because of the inflight entertainment - it was just a no frills "pricey" budget airline and we will not be using them again.

### "aircraft are old and tired"
Seattle to Keflavík roundtrip in B757 in Saga Class, Icelandair's premier product. The only reason to fly Icelandair is that it is the only reasonable way to get from the US to Iceland (the other Icelandic airline that services the USA has terrible reviews). Icelandair's 757 aircraft are old and tired, and the interiors are now showing their age. The Saga Class seat is woefully behind the times. It is comfortable but for a flight that is 6+ hours you expect a flatbed. The one thing Icelandair takes seriously is food. However, if you are vegetarian, be sure to notify then in advance. On the inbound flight from KEF to SEA, it was disgraceful of Icelandair to make passengers go exposed through driving rain and cold to the aircraft after first boarding a bus packed like sardines. A few elderly passengers were seriously inconvenienced. Icelandair has to up its game and replace its fleet. If I had a choice I would not fly the airline for its current product.

### "ruining our vacation"
London to Keflavik, and Icelandair left 70 passenger's bags in London for no reason - they said "computer error" and that they didn't notice that 70 bags didn't make it on the plane. They also left 1 hour later than our planned takeoff because they were still loading luggage on the plane. When we arrived in Keflavik we were told that our luggage may arrive on a later flight that lands at 11:30 pm that day and that they would try to deliver the luggage to our hotel by noon the next day. This meant that we would miss two of the tours that we had already paid for due to our missing luggage. One of which was for the Blue Lagoon and the facility was booked for the entire week. Instead of missing both tours, we opted to miss the Northern Lights tour that evening, rent a car and go back to the airport from our hotel that evening at midnight. We retrieved our luggage and got back to our hotel at 2 am. We asked Icelandair if they would change our return flight to the later flight on the 26th and they refused, berated us on the phone and told us that there was nothing they could do or would do as this was their policy. No compensation - no apologies - no care for their passengers. Never flying Icelandair again. Thanks for ruining our vacation.

### "will not fly with them again"
My wife and I flew from Brussels to Toronto via Keflavik with Icelandair. Unfortunately our bags did not stop over with us. The Icelandair rep in Brussels checked our bags through to Toronto without our knowledge. Incredibly he never thought to ask us even though there was a 16 hour gap between our arrival in Keflavik and our departure. This has never happened in our many years of flying. But the truly incredible part is that after two emails to Icelandair customer service we have still not received any response. Don't need the arrogant service. I have flown Icelandair on three return trips, my first being way back in 1974. We will not fly with them again.

### "crew the best of any airline"
My wife and I have been flying Icelandair at least twice every year between Portland and Glasgow or Zurich. The professionalism and helpfulness of everybody from reservations to flight crew are beyond the best of any airline we have flown. Recently, the reservations office went above and beyond what was called for. We will continue to only fly Icelandair between the US and Europe and certainly hope it remains profitable for them to fly from PDX to KEF.

### "a good solid airline"
We flew from Washington to Keflavik return last week and found Icelandair to be a great experience. Aircraft while older were in good condition. Seats do not lie flat but were comfortable for the 5-6 hour flights. Food was excellent and cabin service was quite attentive. Check in at IAD was flawless as it was in KEF. WiFi was good also. Selection of movies was limited but did include interesting Icelandic films. Overall, this is a good solid airline.

### "felt like some domestic airline"
London Gatwick to Toronto via Keflavik. The overall journey was fair and comfortable. Inflight crew were friendly and did try their best to accommodate my needs. I eat Hindu Veg Meal (HNML) or as some airlines call it Asian Vegetarian Meal (AVML), which I do specify during the booking. But in this travel I failed to specify my dietary needs. This was a bit challenging for air steward, so as to manage some vegetarian option for me. Unlike economy class, where food had to be purchased during flight, my business class travel (Saga class) made it mandatory for them to ensure I am well fed. Food quality was fine, nothing extraordinary in it. However I did like the alcoholic beverages list. Overall food, I could say was just fine. Emirates, Jet Airways and Air India economy class, some times pull off better food than them. They do provide with in flight WIFI service for business travelers, which I found was of decent speed - it was enough to check your respective emails, check news, scroll Facebook and use messaging apps like WhatsApp. The seat was comfortable, but no flat beds or anything - much like premium economy seats in Virgin Atlantic, British Airways etc. Leg room was fine, but not a business class experience there. Felt like I was flying in some domestic airline, rather than international travel. I did enjoy a modest transit at Keflavik international, only to find that their business class lounge was located after immigration. Hence in transit section, there is no facility which covered business class passenger needs. This was a let down. Adding to the problem was language issue. English was not their primary mode of communication and ground staff were not very well versed in communicating with passengers, in what I believe as good and hospitable way.

### "value for what we paid not so bad"
Paris to Edmonton via Reykjavik. The flights from Edmonton to Paris were quite ok, accept for the 1 hour rush plane change in Reykjavik that also requires processing through immigration/security. It is utter chaos, requires 2 shuttles and leaves just enough time to race through. Highly stressful. Bonus was free movies ect. Leaving Paris as we have often run into long checkin and security delays on previous international travel we arrived at the check in for the recommended 3 hr advance. The counters were not open and there was no staff to be found. People were arriving rapidly and a large number of passengers had arrived so we lined a up according to the signage posted. 30 min later first staff arrived and leisurely arranged themselves, then one lady proceeded to change the posted signs and loudly saying we were rude to try to go into higher class lines ect. By this time we had been waiting about 45 min and there were others who had been earlier than us. One kind employee put her head down and politely checked in her line. Also, CDG is a very small airport with minimal amenities once through security. Don't worry about being terribly early. There is also very limited seating in the waiting area. Value for what we paid - it was not so bad. The Icelandic (as in peoples of Iceland) staff has been excellent. In short, leave more than an hour for flight changes in Iceland, don't be anxious to get to Paris Charles De Gaulle early,  eat before or bring food if you don't want to purchase in flight, there's not anything at the airport.

### "it was well worth it"
September 11th, flew Icelandair #853 from Keflavik to Chicago O'Hare. Very funny and friendly check-in lady at the Saga desk (flew premium economy but could use the Saga check-in). Security line long and the airport overall is insane. As have been reported here many times, the terminal is too small for all the flights leaving in the banks to Europe or USA. Gates close together and passenger boarding lines criss-crossing each other - massive confusion. Once we boarded the bus to the aircraft things were calm. Friendly welcome from the FA and seated in row 6 - business class seats but premium economy service. Overall a great flight but only complaint is the food portion - it was so tiny. Bring food or you will be starving. Excellent choices for AVOD entertainment, comfy pillow and blanket and seat, along with great service. For $600 for a one-way ticket it was well worth it. Look forward to returning to Iceland as it is a fantastic country.

### "not entertain this airline again"
Birmingham to Newark via Keflavik. This review is prompted by my poor experience with the checking in / baggage staff at Newark airport. I was able to book preferred seats for myself wife and daughter for the outward flight. No problems there. In order to secure seats for the return flight I attempted to book online. However, their website was not working. I contacted bookings by phone and after the obligatory wait was assured the seats I wanted were confirmed as mine. This all changed once I got to baggage check in. I was informed that the seats had been taken. I will spare the reader the to and fro of conversation between myself and the check in staff. What left a bad taste for me was the condescending attitude thinly disguised behind an even thinner gauze of professionalism. I will not entertain this airline again and would warn potential customers to brace themselves for a letdown of there plans due to the whims of the booking in / baggage staff. On a positive note the flight attendants were good.

### "pathetic customer service"
Anchorage to London Heathrow via Keflavik. The first leg of the flight from Anchorage, was delayed two hours. I asked three different employees why and received three different answers. Spent over seven hours in the airport in Iceland, more delays. During a two hour period, Icelandair announced that five flights were overbooked. Our flight was never announced as boarding, we happened to see folks lining up. Food is available for purchase in economy, but looked awful. We arrive in Heathrow at 9 pm. Luggage did not appear on the baggage carousel until 10 pm. At 10:30 pm it became obvious the passengers from Anchorage would not be receiving our luggage. Filled out forms and was told our luggage would be delivered to our hotel the next morning (Saturday). We did not receive our luggage until Sunday at noon, just as we were checking out. Starting August 18, I have sent emails to Icelandair. I get an auto reply, that cannot be responded to. I have tried calling but cannot get past the language barrier. Very frustrated with the pathetic customer service.

### "been a complete nightmare"
Denver to Reykjavík. It was my first trip overseas and I wanted to check out Iceland before heading to Italy. There is only one flight out of Denver per day to Iceland. So, of course the flight was on time. It had been sitting on the tarmac all day. Once we boarded, the cabin was over 100 degrees. The crew made us stay on the plane for close to an hour before we were allowed to go back into the terminal. We watched while the maintenance crew try to figure out what was wrong. After 45 minutes, we boarded again. I discovered my seat would not recline on the 7 hour overnight flight and I could not be moved to another seat. Then we were told none of our checked baggage was loaded and would be delivered to our final destination the next day. Their solution? Free wi-fi for everyone! My touchscreen was faulty and I could do nothing, so I had a bright light shining in my face the whole time. I asked for it to be shut off several times, but they couldn't. Needless to say, I had no luggage during my one day stay. I was given an overnight bag that included some grooming essentials, but I had no clothes, so that was of no help other than being able to brush my teeth. I sent a complaint to their customer relations department asking for a refund as soon as I returned to the States on July 30. It's now September 16 and it hasn't even been reviewed! Do they have that many complaints that it 2 months to read an email?! I've called 5 times to get status and get pushed out a few more days or a few more weeks every time. The last call was this morning and I tried to escalate to speak to a supervisor multiple times, but that was clearly not going to happen. She told me "two more weeks. Two days ago I was told 4 weeks and last week I was told a few more days. Who is right?! I asked for a guarantee and she said that's just how it works. Whatever that means. I am appalled at this airline and would never fly with them again. I refuse to take a travel credit if offered and just want my money back. This has been a complete nightmare!

### "great value for money"
We have flown from Amsterdam to New York and back via Reykjavik, and didn't encounter any issues. The flight was smooth and easy. I was a bit worried about connection in Reykjavik as we only had 1 hour and 50 minutes to change planes, however it was more than enough to calmly find the right gate and have a coffee and a quick bite at the airport. A pretty nice collection of movie and tv shows, which is enough to keep you busy for a transatlantic flight. The food was ok, nothing too exciting, but ok if you really can't wait until you arrive. All in all, great value for money, will definitely fly them again.

### "never fly Icelandair again"
Seattle to Paris via Reykjavik. The Icelandair flight attendants on my flight to Europe were not very friendly and I chalked it up to a bad day. While on my vacation my wife fell and broke her wrist and had to have surgery. I called both Priceline and Icelandair to find out about making the flight more comfortable for her and was willing to pay for an upgrade to economy comfort or business class. Neither of them were able to ascertain the value of my remaining flight and could not sell me an upgrade. I was willing to leave early if there were other flights with more available seats. In the end the customer service agent at Icelandair was unwilling to give me her name, let me speak to her customer service agent and ultimately hung up on me. I will never fly Icelandair again!

### "nowhere near business class"
Stockholm to Toronto via Keflavik in May. I have previously flown Icelandair in economy, and know them to be a low cost carrier. Thought I would try their business class, but was not expecting much. Turns out I was right. It is still a low cost carrier and you get what you pay for. The inflight experience was akin to a premium economy on other (not fancy) airlines. The seat is of OK comfort with passable but not great legroom. The food is of economy class quality although the portions are larger than in Y. Wine was of decent but not great quality. It was however offered freely. Service was pleasant and friendly in typical Scandinavian cool / detached manner, but no complaints here. The inflight entertainment system is extremely limited with very few and outdated movie choices. You do get the use of decent headphones (in Y you have to pay for this). I did not use the WiFi that is offered free of charge to business class passengers. The lounge in KEF is surprisingly pleasant. Smallish, but intimate rather than "small". Not bad choice of food (was there for breakfast both times). Only had brief time in lounge as layover was brief. Did not use washrooms while there. The airport experience in KEF is however otherwise horrendous. The airport gets very busy and you are bussed from and to the plane. Prior to getting on the bus for boarding however, everyone stands jam-packed in a "holding pen" like area, for quite a while. On both trips it took a long time before we were "released" from the penn unto the busses, and the experience standing literally squeezed shoulder to shoulder in such a crowd was unpleasant to say the least. Boarding is totally chaotic, and no priority for J passengers. KEF is clearly way overwhelmed by number of travellers. This may not be Icelandair's fault, but does mar the experience. So in summary: the business class flight was about half the price from I would have had to pay on SK or AC, and the quality reflects this. Again, you get what you pay for: in this case a better seat (but not great) than in Y, bigger food portions, headset and lounge access. It is nowhere near a business class experience of other transatlantic carriers and miles from that on Asian carriers. Value for money? : maybe, if an improved seat comfort is very important to you, otherwise not. In the future I'll tough it out in Y on that route and use the money I save on some of the many fantastic restaurants in Toronto.

### "no-frills approach .. costs less"
I found that Icelandair provides the most comfortable trip for those who cannot stand being on a plane for 7, 8, or 9 hours or longer. I fly via Keflavik and sometimes spend a night or two in Iceland to relax between flights. Economy is cheap, but you have a clean seat and a safe flight - there are no frills. Economy Comfort is located in the same area of the plane, with just the middle seat free (in a 3-3 configuration). There is a limited selection of free food and drink. Saga Class is like business class on a domestic flight : seats are larger, tasty food, attentive staff, hot towels, etc. Due to a security issue scare at Frankfurt airport, our flight was delayed by about three hours, staff handled this situation professionally. Most passengers missed their connecting flights at Keflavik, but I was among the lucky ones: the plane from Frankfurt continued on to Boston, where we arrived with about a two-hour delay. Several reviews have rightly noted that the Keflavik airport has become somewhat chaotic. Even if you are booked in Economy Comfort or in Saga Class, you will board with everyone else, in no particular order. Elderly people may find it unpleasant to be standing for extended periods at the gates, waiting for the boarding process to begin. There are perhaps a dozen seats at each gate; that's it. In conclusion, I enjoy flying on Icelandair, with a few reservations. One may be disappointed by the no-frills approach or the fact that Sage Class does not compare with a real business class, but it costs less too.

### "a tough slog back in Steerage"
Munich to Denver via Keflavik. Not a bad airline / flight to and from Munich. I'm 60 so this is a tough slog back in Steerage for the long leg. Next time I might upgrade just a bit to Economy Comfort, but it doubles the flight cost. My trip was $1250 RT, others using services cut that price dramatically. I'm 6'1" 210, and there is just barely enough room on the 7.5 hour leg to Denver. The movies help some. Right now, they appear to be dropping you off, and sending you off, via the tarmac, so plan on a little walk to and from. I departed and arrived, out on the tarmac. A small backpack is easier accessed than a suitcase on board. I counted 5 flights on adjacent gates while walking to my outbound gate to Denver and 4 departed at 1700 and mine was 1645 so plan on a packed house. Get your gate departure off the monitor and "cattle call" your way to it. It appears to be the airport issue, not the airlines, and might resolve if they are under construction. They appear to intentionally fly everything out at 5 pm local time I wanted to buy some socks at the airport shop, but found none displayed. They had them last December, so it must be a seasonal item. I'm curious if their points deal actually pays off as they just emailed me a buy 2 and get 1 free for points, but 2nd class requires 240,000 points approximately for a trip. Plan on buying your own booze, a Baguette, and 2 Gin Tonics was $20 bucks USD, $2400 Kroner. Someone on the flight stayed over in Iceland, and complained of high prices, but I suspect poor planning may have played into that as she was quoted $240 for a taxi to town, and I'd bet there is a bus of sorts. Crew was nice, but no moving up in seats. I believe they sell out the front row of first emergency exit tow as Economy Comfort seats, along with the rows in front of that. On the flight in from Kef-Munich people scrambled for those 6-8 seats, and nobody said anything when they instantly filled. Sorry for the blurry terminal photo, was rushing to find the gate. Only about 50 minutes between legs, so you have to hoof it. There is just enough time to man-shop the gift shop, in and outbound. Your mileage may vary!

### "don't go there on Icelandair"
Boston to Reykjavik. Awful from the outset. Originally scheduled to leave from JFK, but weather cancelled my connecting flight. Was able to salvage trip by driving to Boston and catching Icelandair flight departing from there; got the last 2 seats approx. 5 hours before the flight. Plane was a dump. Old, dirty and by far the worst Business Class cabin I've ever seen. Basically just 2x2 seating in old seats that barely reclined; and minimal legroom. Old TV screens in armrests that would not lock into place, so you constantly have to readjust their position to actually watch. But such limited availability of entertainment it didn't really matter. Except that you couldn't sleep because the seats would not recline and there was no legroom. Well, maybe just enjoy a nice meal. Not a chance. Some lame tiny piece of chicken, overcooked and tough. Some sort of Indian yogurt sauce on the side to try make it palatable, but that was awful too. On a bed of flavorless rice. And mediocre wine. And to cap it all off, Icelandair charged me an extra $1350 for changing flights, even though I couldn't make the original one due to weather and managed to get to Boston instead and take two empty seats. And then Icelandair won't respond to several requests to discuss reversing that charge. Radio silence. Do yourself a favor. Iceland is a spectacular country, but don't go there on Icelandair. And if for some reason you have no other option but Icelandair, do not pay extra for Business Class, because it isn't and you will have just as good a seat and experience in Coach.

### "no frills airline but efficient"
4th year we use Icelandair on our Brussels or Paris to Denver flights. We see two big advantages when flying with them : reasnnable fares and short connections. When reserve in advance, they're much cheaper than other airlines, with a shorter total travel time, thanks to short connections in KEF. From the 16 flights we took, only 1 was delayed (KEF-DEN on Aug. 29). You have to pay for food onboard, but we use our Saga Points for that. Staff is very friendly and courteous, IFE not bad (movies in Icelandic and English only). A few planes don't have IFE, but then they provide IPads. The only complain is that, in summer, KEF airport seems overused, and many flights have to board and unboard with busses as they lack jetbridges. A no frills airline but efficient.

### "service was excellent"
Denver to Oslo via Keflavik with Icelandair. This is the second time we have flown Icelandair out of Denver to Europe with a stopover in Iceland for several days. We chose Saga class, similar to Business class. The cabin had a total of 12 seats, service was excellent and follow up after wine was accidentally spilled on my jeans was good too. The flights were on time and as seasoned travelers, we have no complaints at all. I was disappointed to see so many unhappy travelers.

### "fly these guys again next time"
Flew IcelandAir round trip out of Seattle on a direct flight to Keflavik return. The staff, like most of the people I met in Iceland, were extremely friendly. My return flight was delayed by 45 minutes, which isn't the end of the world, but definitely adds to the theme of delayed flights I saw on other reviews. The seat comfort was decent and the in-flight movie selection was ok (the movies were also unedited, something I haven't see a lot of on international flights). There was also a USB charger port. I will add though that your personal headphones won't work and you'll be forced into buying a pair of theirs, and yes I said buy, which leads me to my biggest gripe: nothing is free. They hand you a bottle of water when board but that's it. No free booze, no meals, etc. I asked for a whole can of Pepsi and the flight attendant made it sound like she was putting her job on the line by giving me the whole can. She seriously insisted I try to hide it. I've flown on way shorter international flights and still been served food and booze. However, I'm not sure I can fly direct to Iceland for less than what these guys are charging, as my ticket was crazy cheap. So maybe 10 bucks for a couple of beers isn't the end of the world. I'll fly these guys again next time I visit Iceland.

### "the issue that developed was baggage"
Actually a great flight with Icelandair from Frankfurt to Reykjavik. Took off on time. Seated in their version of business class. Upon arriving at KEF, the issue that developed because of renovation going on in the building, was baggage. They had probably ten planes to land within a two-hour period and their temp deal with baggage is messed up. Spent almost an hour waiting on the baggage to appear, with a overflow crowd of people. Once I got my bags, no trouble. Six days later, leaving KEF, easily walked through the airport, and spent an hour at the business lounge for the airline. Great place and terrific food.

### "do a horrible job of delivering"
New York to Oslo via Reykjavik. Don't fly this airline if you have baggage to check! First off, both flights to Norway were delayed several hours. I was notified of the second delay but not the first. Even though I had to go through customs my backpack did not get transferred between planes. Neith did the luggage for the 5-10 other people changing planes. The bag didn't arrive on the next plane which didn't arrive for another 8 hours late but took over 24 hours because the flight the next day was also over an hour late as the previous three had been. Customer service is also terrible. The customer service rep didn't know how to respond when I told her I didn't know where I was staying because they lost my bag which had my tent in it. She then suggested I continue on my trip hiking in the mountains without any gear and the airline would courier it to me even though she had no idea where my luggage was and when she'd have it. I've had to pay for a hotel, train fare, overage on the rental car and I missed one of the three hikes I had planned. They also failed to call me as promised that night by the specified time. When I tried to call back at the time they suggested I found out their office was closed for the night leaving me without any idea as to whether I'd get my backpack. It's been five weeks and I've yet to hear back from the airline regarding my claim. During the rest of my trip, I met a French couple that told me the airline was notorious for losing baggage, that it happened to their sister and when they found it, they compounded the problem by couriering it to the wrong place. I also stayed at a hostel in Iceland where a couple was waiting on their backpacks so they could do their hikes. For an airline that promotes stopovers with a picture of a tent on a mountain in their website, they do a horrible job of delivering. There are plenty of other airlines that do a much better job at a comparable price.

### "I do not recommend this company"
Paris to Reykjavik. Worst Flight ever : Delay of allmost 2 hours due to some issues with the luggages drop in in Orly Airport Paris, no communication about it until we get in the plane where the pilot apologize. Arrival at Reykjavik : no luggage - we were a group of 20 people who waited for more than 2 hours in the luggage room with no informations about our bags. Iceland is the kind of destination that you prepare months in advance, I had plan to do the Laugavegur Trek the day after we arrive and then take a rental car 4 days later to drive around the Island. Well when your tent, sleeping bag and all your clothes arrive 48 hours after you, the whole trip you were planning for a year is pretty dead. During that whole period of 48 hours, I have paid 2 nights in Reykjavik and Keflavik hostel, Last minute reservation in Iceland are really expensive, no help from Icelandair, just received 100$ per person , which does not cover at all the additionnal expenses. Iceland is a wonderful Island, but it is also an expensive destination which deserve appropriate and reliable transportation service. I've been working hard to put money aside to prepare with care this journey and Icelandair turned it into a big deception. I do not recommend this company, customer service is really poor - I had to call them about 20 times, even when they finally received the luggage they still were not able to deliver it in time  4 hours later, at this point I did not even care i just wanted to have my bagpack).

### "seat was comfortable"
Flew from New York-JFK to Helsinki Vantaa via Keflavik. The comfort of Iceland's carrier began right at the check in counter. The staff assured me that my bags would make the connection, and offered a voucher if they didn't. The flight departed on time. Everyone was given a pillow, blanket, and a bottle of Icelandic water. Cabin crew spoke very good English. IFE was perfect. The seat was comfortable, I almost felt like I was in first class. I'll certainly be flying Icelandair next time I fly to Europe, since direct flights are insanely expensive.

### "pandemonium at Keflavik Airport"
Flight from Oslo to Seattle via Reykjavik with Icelandair. Layover in Reykjavik for 90 min. Total pandemonium at Keflavik Airport, where between 4 pm and 5:30 pm there were 20+ flights set up for departure, and thousands of passengers sitting on floors everywhere, as the gates can accommodate no more than about 50 people each, if that. The gate agents announce flights without an intercom, so that only the nearest 10 people to them can actually hear the announcements. The airport is expanding, but who designed this mess? With most international flights having 200+ passengers, why are the gates configured to handle less than 50 people? Also, the Business Class lounge is before you go through the passport check, not near the gates. Incredibly bad planning.

### "lack of communication about delays"
Chicago to Paris via Keflavik. We flew on Icelandair to take advantage of the free stopover program for our honeymoon to go to France for a week with a 3-day stopover in Reykjavik at the end. On the way out, our flight was delayed 2.5 hours. The crew was not forthcoming with information as the delays mounted. Once we boarded they insisted that we would "make up time" and be fine. They refused to give anymore information. We missed our flight, as we were 30 minutes late for our 745am departure. It seemed like dozens of people were on our connection and missed the flight. The customs officer remarked to us at passport check that this seems to happen quite frequently with Icelandair. Any information that you see about short connections being a problem or that they will hold a departure for a late arrival with numerous connecting passengers does not square with our experience. They rebooked all of us on a 1am flight and gave us hotel. We were sent to the wrong hotel and then sent to a hotel that didn't have availability. This was how we started our honeymoon. On our return trip, we were diverted from Chicago to Minneapolis inflight after circling around ORD for a while without getting much information from the crew. Upon landing in Minneapolis, we sat on the runway for 2 hours before regulations forced them to deplane the passengers. Our plane had to be towed into the gate and they were not forthcoming about the subsequent equipment failure other than that they couldn't get the engine to start. They were not able to get the plane to fly afterwards and did not provide any information about an alternate flight. They did not have hotels available so once we deplaned, everyone was stranded without information midnight. After a couple hours, once most people had left to figure out accommodation on their own, they finally arranged for hotels. My wife and I rebooked onto a Southwest Airlines flight as we still had not received information on any type of return flight. I strongly recommend against booking with Icelandair due to the lack of communication about delays and the failure to provide support to passengers and the variety of other issues associated with twice being stranded.

### "10 hour flight turned into 24 hours"
I flew from Paris to Edmonton via Reykjavik  alone with a 2 year old and a 5 year old. As it was the shortest traveling time available, I took the risk even with reading bad reviews of Icelandair. I just needed something that was fast so it didn't tire me too much with my 2 kids, my 10 hour flight turned into a 24 hour flight. Flight delayed causing me to miss my connection flight. Long queue to rebook connection flight and ending up booking my 5 year old in a separate aisle (who in the right mind does that?) - getting stranded in Reykjavik for 1 night. Airline booked us in a bad hotel where I had to share 1 bed with my 2 kids - with horrible food as you had hotel food vouchers only (Centerhotel). Back the next day only to get another delayed flight. I have 2 kids - they gave us 1 infant meal so I asked for another one and they said they have no extras and couldn't come up with a solution on what to give my 2 year old, even if I had said she eats everything - it was just no. Wifi not working. I had about 3 people around me from different Icelandair flight complaining about their hell experience with the airline as well. In edmonton when i arrive the next day  no luggage. I asked the staff why the flights were delayed and why my baggage got left behind, their answer "we dont know and we are sorry for the inconvenience". I ask the service counter to rebook my return flight as I had lost a day due to the delay - after 15 minutes of waiting and counter staff talking to the sales desk on the phone - the answer I get is "please visit the website and call the number there as we cannot do anything for you now". Its a shame there are no negative ratings to choose from, as Icelandair don't even deserve level 1.

### "sheer annoyance at the delays"
I am writing to express my sheer annoyance at the delays we experienced on our flights both departing and returning when we left both Gatwick and returned from JFK. When leaving Gatwick on Friday 22nd July there was a delay in the plane arriving and all passengers were left waiting for the plane to arrive with little information other than its late in arriving. This then put untold stress on me as a passenger as we had a connecting flight to make, however I was supposed to find assurance in the "airport at Reykjavik is small so you won't be late" which I can assure you for the entire flight I found no comfort in whatsoever. To then arrive at JFK on 27th July at the checking in time, only to be told once again the plane was delayed, this time due to computer issues was beyond amusing. The plane was over 3hrs late in boarding and we then sat on the runway for a good 45 minutes waiting to take off. We were at the end of our holiday, we had limited funds for the time in the airport as we had to stop over and fly through the night and not even a food voucher was offered by the airline who had for the second time in less than a week made us delayed on our journey. Not only were we late in starting our holiday but we did not return home until a good four hours after we should have in a completely different airport to what had been written on our flight ticket details. We had London Gatwick printed on our tickets and when checking in we were told we were going to London Heathrow. The wifi on the airplane did not work for the entire flight and we had to wait until we got to Reykjavik​ to use the airport wifi to contact my father who had been told to meet us at Gatwick at the correct time prior to the extensive delays. The stress and worry the airline put me and my family through on two journeys will never be forgotten.

### "all four flights were delayed"
Boston to Munich via Reykjavik. Cost for a flight going from Boston to Munich, and return from Charles De Gaulle to Logan was over $2,000 for two economy seats. Booked three months in advance. First flight delayed by greater than an hour. Caused us to miss our connecting flight. Original landing in Munich time: 1:05pm - actual was 8:30pm. Furthermore, we were redirected from Reykjavik to Oslo before going to Munich. Our compensation: 16 Euro voucher per person for lunch. I wrote to customer service two weeks ago and received an automated response. Nothing since. Now I am standing in line again, and the flight is already delayed one hour, which will cause us to miss our connecting flight home. Lastly, the wait in their check-in line is unbelievable. Over 300 people around the airport in Charles De Gaulle. Absolutely terrible. Will never fly with again. We had four flights with Icelandair, and all four flights were delayed by more than an hour. I purchased 60$ flights through EasyJet and Alitalia that were more reliable and offered more than Icelandair. It was an international flight, and not one complimentary snack was offered. Only soda, water, and juice was free. This was a 3hr+ and 5hr+ hour flight. Alitalia gave me crackers for free on a 45 minute jump from Venice to Rome. Lastly, Icelandair planes are so overused that they don't have the time to clean in between flights. Icelandair's business model is broken and they should be ashamed.

### "never fly with this airline again"
I had flown Icelandair about 10 years ago and was satisfied with a no frills airline. Decided to fly with Icelandair to Germany again, which was a mistake. Their customer service is terrible; on the phone, at the terminal, and in the air. The flight departed Washington Dulles 3 hours late due to Air Traffic Control issues, Icelandair was not at fault. This caused a missed connecting flight out of Reykjavik, which is where Customer Service issues started. A 7 hour layover in Reykjavik with Customer Service ensuring that our luggage would be transferred to the later flight. Boarding was delayed for this flight along with the departure. Upon arriving in Frankfurt, no luggage, in fact all of the passengers from Washington Dulles that missed the connecting flight out of Reykjavik and had the 7 hour layover did not get their luggage. The baggage claim service at Frankfurt was overwhelmed by the large number of passengers who were missing their luggage. A day later the Icelandair web site stated that they were still trying to trace my luggage, telephone calls were the same, unable to determine the location of my luggage. In general Icelandair is probably fine if there are no issues, but if there are issues their Customer Service is rude, impolite, and discourteous. I will never fly with this airline again and would recommend that other potential customers to do likewise.

### "the worst flying experience"
We flew Icelandair from Boston to London. We purchased travel protection when purchasing the tickets. There was a terrible accident in route to the airport (London) which caused huge delays. We arrived 40 min prior to scheduled departure but they would not let us even see if we could make the flight which turned out to be delayed anyway. They had 5 unsold seats on a flight leaving 5 hours later for which they wanted to charge us $3150 USD to change and they gave us 7 minutes to decide or they would cancel the remainder of our ticket (KEF to BOS). We tried to call the travel insurance to see if they would offer more assistance but they said claims should be filed afterwards. My husband went to talk to the Icelandair agents and explain we just got an email that the flight was delayed but they said it was too late and the entire ticket was now canceled. We spent $2200 to buy tickets on another carrier to fly directly from London to BOS. I filled a claim form on-line 28 days ago and received an auto generated email saying the review could take up to 14 days but I still haven't heard anything! I sent a follow up request through their website (no email address listed) 10 days ago. Today I called and waited on hold 20 min but when they answered they said I need to call during Iceland hours as they were closed. Both legs we took to London (BOS-KEF) and (KEF-LGW) were delayed 1 and 2 hours respectively. We got a small water bottle on the first leg but were offered nothing else either time. This is easily the worst flying experience I have ever had and we travel about 4-5 times a year.

### "definitely book this airline again"
Keflavik to Boston. The flight crew is very professional, helpful and personable. They even made accommodations for my daughter who became very airsick. Can't be more pleased with their level of attention and service both in reservations and during flights. Economy seats provide more leg room than some airlines. Overall, excellent experience during all 6 flights. Will definitely book with this airline again!

### "has a serious problem with delays"
Paris to Boston via Keflavik. I wanted to give Icelandair the benefit of the doubt. Since the seats, entertainment, and food aren't bad. But I've absolutely had it. I thought maybe it was just my luck, but this airline has a serious problem with delays. Don't fly with them if you need to be somewhere at a certain time because there's 95% chance you won't get there on time. Every flight I've had with them has been delayed. Not worth the lower airfare.

### "took 5 flights, all delayed"
Minneapolis to Reykjavik return with Icelandair. We took 5 flights in 3 weeks with Icelandair. All of them were delayed. Plane cabins were hot. Communication about the problems were after the fact. No free food or snacks. On a 6 hour flight, I would think you could give a can of pop vs just a glass. At Keflavik airport there is little seating at gate. With 3 flights leaving at once it was packed. On a bus to the plane with one flight, we waited 30 mins standing before we could board. And another flight called last call 8 times. Delaying all those on the flight as they should of been departed already.

### "customer service was atrocious"
Paris to Chicago via Keflavik with Icelandair. We were set to depart Paris at 2.10 for our ultimate destination Chicago with a layover in Keflavik. In Paris the Icelandair aircraft was late to pick us up. Since our layover and many others was short we were all very concerned about making our connecting flights. We were reassured that they would hold our flights for us. When we arrived in Keflavik our pilot announced at 4.45 that the connecting flight to Chicago was at gate D34. We were told to run and hurry to make our flight. We ran. When we checked in our boarding passes they told us again your flight is waiting hurry and run. When we got to the securitu checkpoint they told us again the flight was waiting for us. When we got to our gate the flight had left. We have 3 children at home waiting for us. I had to find emergency childcare because the only flight we could get on is 24 hours later. My husband is missing a day of work. The customer service was atrocious there were 20 passengers left behind who are missing their children, work, orientations, school, etc. We were offered little accommodation to this horrible set back. They put us up in a 1.5 star hotel with meals. That doesn't make up for the lies told by their employees or the stress put on the travelers. It's worth your time and money to book with another airline. Never never fly with Icelandair.

### "customer service at desks was rude"
Boston to Munich via Reykjavik with Icelandair. The service and amenities were nice. The first flight was delayed by an hour and caused us to miss our connecting flight, which was also Icelandair. Their reschedule effectively ruined our first day of vacation by making us 7 hours late, and having to go on two extra flights. Their customer service at the desks was rude and unhelpful. Our baggage was also delayed and almost caused us to be late to our connecting flight.

### "know how to satisfy customers"
Flew Icelandair from Toronto to Reyjavík and I must say they made my trip to Iceland even more pleasant. The flight attendants were all very nice, they handed out free water bottles to everyone and always had a smile on their face. I even got up and went to the back to ask them for tips as to what I needed to see and eat in Iceland and they happily gave me suggestions and even wrote the names of some good restaurants down for me. The one downside was that their was no complimentary food, but that was acceptable for only a 5 hour flight. The seats were relatively comfortable and the inflight intertainment system was equipped with a good selection of movies. Overall, Icelandair know how to satisfy customers and I will be flying with them again if I am given the chance to.

### "late arrivals and missed connections"
Total debacle. with Icelandair from Edmonton to Helsinki via Keflavik. Was supposed to be a 10 hour flight, but turned into 18 hours because of late arrivals and missed connections. They lost our baggage, promised to deliver it to the hotel and didn't. Two days later, I had to spend 30 minutes on the phone to track it down before finally rushing to the airport to get it. The alternative was to leave to Russia and hope that they somehow got the luggage to me. I can accept the cattle-car level service that they offer on the flight if they can get me and my luggage from point A to B efficiently. But this was nothing more than late flights, missed connections, and broken promises. Worse yet, the airline's feedback system is completely byzantine and they don't seem to respond. Two weeks after writing, I haven't heard anything.

### "nice but immensely inefficient"
This was our first experience with Icelandair and Iceland Airport and we intend it to be our last. We flew round trip from Boston to Glasgow with a layover at Keflavik Airport both ways. Flights into Iceland both ways were on time, but from Keflavik out, both were significantly late, 4+ hours going to Glasgow and 1+ hours going to Boston. In both cases, Icelandair or anyone at the airport for that matter didn't seem concerned, almost like it was standard procedure. Everyone was really nice but immensely inefficient. The airport itself has no idea how to handle any kind of volume, yet they seem to think they can. It's like they marketed and booked flights before they had the infrastructure and ability it handle them.

### "seats the most uncomfortable I have been on"
Newark to Copenhagen via Keflavik with Icelandair. The seats on this airplane are the most uncomfortable I have ever been on. When we arrived we had to deplane using the stairs and then board buses to get to the terminal. At the terminal we had to stand in line for what seemed like forever. There were no seats for anyone who is using a cane. We then had to board the buses again to get to the airplane where we again had to trudge up the stairs to the plane. Our flight back was delayed for over an hour (no reason given) but they held the connecting flight for us (this was the only good thing I have to say about Icelandair). Again we had to run to our gate, get the buses, and climb the stairs. I definitely will not be flying Icelandair again.

### "refused to change my ticket back"
We flew from Chicago through Iceland to Paris with Icelandair. Our flight from Chicago was delayed an hour and Icelandair told us we would only land 15 minutes late and that we would make our connecting just fine and they would even hold the flight as there were many of us on the Chicago flight on this connecting flight as well. Throughout this 6.5 hour flight we were offered no complimentary snacks or meals and it was so hot it was impossible to catch any sleep. We arrived right on the wire in Iceland and made it to our gate. Someone boarded right in front of me but when I scanned my boarding pass they said I could not board and I had to go see customer service. I ran to customer service and everyone let me to the front of the line as I still hoped to make my flight. They informed me they assumed we would not make it, (even though we very clearly did), booked me to a new flight and refused to change my ticket back to its original. Our new flight was 3 hours later and was not a direct to Paris like our original. Instead we were stopping through Birmingham, England where we had another 4 hour layover until we left for Paris. Our flight to Birmingham was also delayed, however it was never announced. There was no attendant and the screen continuously just said on time even when it hit our departure time and we were still standing at the gate waiting on a shuttle to take us to our plane. We boarded the plane with them apologizing for the hour long delay after the fact and also not saying why it occurred in the first place. We arrived in Birmingham and went through customs and baggage claim and what do you know? Icelandair lost our luggage and told us it would not arrive into Birmingham until the following day. Mind you our final destination for that day was Paris. We are now finally in Paris 8 hours later than we were supposed to arrive and with no bags. I highly recommend you do not fly with Icelandair, they do not take responsibility for anything. I have never had an experience this poor with an airline.

### "seats are glorified economy"
This was my first experience with Icelandair. I was booked in Saga (business) class by a German company that offered no option. On the whole, Saga class is at least a step below the usual business class experience. It is cheaper, and it feels it. The food is dreadful. The seats are glorified economy with perhaps a few more inches. The worst part though was the connection through Reykjavik. Icelandair boarded 5 flights at 1030 in contiguous gates. It felt like a very claustrophobic experience, like a rock concert or military deployment. No specific call for business was made or possible given the cramped quarters. The personnel were competent if cool and distant. Not a business friendly airline.

### "food is not included in your ticket price"
Minneapolis to Zurich via Reykjavik with Icelandair. 1 hr late leaving MSP. We had a connecting flight to make from so it worried us a bit in flight. An attendant assured us they'd wait. As to the plane and the amenities - the wall panels were cracked at the seams and peeling away in spots. No legroom. I'm 5'6", I can't imagine what a tall person endures. Food is not included in your ticket price. I've flown Delta transatlantic and been fed delicious food, lots of beverages, warm towels, movies with provided ear buds etc for less than Icelandair. Never again. So, of course the flight didn't wait even though they knew we were late before we left MSP. Flights had been late every day for 4 days prior - baggage handlers or something. They put us up in a hotel, food and taxi vouchers, etc (and we were thankful), but we missed 1 whole day of our vacation in Switzerland and one night's lodging there. Although our brief stay in Reykjavik was interesting, listening to Independence Day partiers outside our hotel all night made for a hellish lack of sleep on top of the normal time zone adjustments. We're not home yet, so the return trip could either be better or worse, but I am definitely not looking forward to it.

### "still knows how to treat people"
Although flying today is definitely not what it used to be with fees for just about everything. I was nonetheless happy. In November I left Toronto and went to Iceland and Alaska. I flew from Toronto to Iceland then to JFK on my way to Alaska. I will say that Icelandair was a nice surprise - you get what you pay for. You pay for your meals on board, which means you're not being soaked when paying for your tickets with everything inclusive. They were also very polite. With airlines constantly gouging the public and going out of their way to make flying as horrible as possible, it's nice to know, that Icelandair still knows how to treat people. At the airport in Reykjavik, there was no hassle. Icelandairs lounge at Reykjavik everything from food to beer and wine was free. Then again, this is not, a North American airline.

### "definitely fly with them again"
We were pleasantly surprised with the value and service provided by Icelandair on this trip. We booked flights from Toronto to Glasgow via Reykjavik on the way out and the return leg was Glasgow to Toronto, again via Reykjavik but this time with a 5 day stopover in Reykjavik to break it up. We were aware when booking economy tickets that meals were not included, and assumed that overall service may have been a bit sparse. This was not the case. Our son (2) was provided with a snack on each leg of our journey and what he was given was pretty reasonable. They also gave kids free headphones and an activity pack which was pretty good. For the adults, we were aware we had to fend for ourselves so stocked up with some snacks and sandwiches for each leg of the journey but the flight attendants came by a few times with soft drinks, water etc and all were very pleasant. The seats were comfortable with a decent amount of legroom (more than expected). The entertainment choice was an interesting mix of old and new and in these days of paying for everything, the 2 checked bags per person allowance was extremely generous. If there was a complaint, it would be about the boarding process at Keflavik airport on the way back to Toronto. Not sure if this is the fault of the airline or the airport. We had their bigger 767 for this flight and we had to lineup, have our boarding pass scanned, and then lineup again for a while before they let us go up the stairs to the ramp with the small space getting more and more cramped every second. The whole process seemed very disorganised and in the end our flight was 90 minutes late in leaving. They said this was because loading was not finished, but the boarding process cannot have helped. This one issue aside we would definitely fly with them again - it was a positive experience

### "woefully behind the times"
Roundtrip Seattle to Keflavik in May/June 2016 in Saga Class, Icelandair's business class. At SEA the check-in was smooth. Icelandair does not participate in priority lane privileges and so I had to go through the regular line for security screening. The SEA-KEF flight was an old worn-out 757 named Askja (after an Icelandic caldera). The interiors were shockingly shabby and dirty. In the Saga Class cabin there were panels peeling off from the ceiling (see attached photos). The spaces around the seat and in the tray receptacle had scraps of food and dirt in it, the bathrooms were grimy. Wifi didn't work. The onboard staff was very nice, food was good but vegetarians have limited options. The return KEF-SEA flight was on a 757-200 named Snæfell which was in much better condition than the Askja aircraft. Icelandair has a pleasant lounge at Keflavík airport and the breakfast offerings were copious. Saga Class passengers have no boarding priority at Keflavík which is a real shame. Again, the onboard staff was outstanding. Icelandair Saga Class is woefully behind the times. The aircraft are very old and in dire need of replacement. The premier product is not worth the money.

### "cabin service was Spartan"
Flew Icelandair from Newark to Keflavik. Chaotic boarding "process" if it can be called that, at both Newark and Reykjavik. Basically, it was an unannounced free-for-all. Seats were uncomfortable. Cabin service was spartan. Planes were boarded and disembarked (in pouring rain) from runway tarmac in Reykjavik, something we'd only encountered in much smaller airports.

### Icelandair customer review
Reykjavik to Copenhagen with Icelandair. Very dissatisfied with this airline. Seat reserved and printed on ticket was 7E and was changed on the spot with no explanation or apology to 28F. Absolutely ridiculous. Staff were not friendly. Flight itself was uncomfortably hot the entire time. Definitely will not fly with this airline again.

### "it was a sad experience"
Chicago to Munich via Reykjavik with Icelandair. We left 1.5 hours late from Chicago without explanation. Our connecting flight, which was also with Icelandair, waited for us (12 people). We were not allowed to board. Instead, we were moved to another airline's flight at a much later time. We lost an entire day in Germany. On top of all of this, the Icelandair personnel lied right to our faces about the plane already being gone. It was a sad experience. They're completely over matched in this industry. I'll pay more for honest people, who keep me informed about my flights, and get me to my destination on time.

### "overextended itself"
Newark to Glasgow via Reykjavik, and Icelandair is is a an airline that has overextended itself. The flight to Glasgow was without incident aside of a small delay due to labor action by air traffic comptrollers. The return trip was different. The delay in Glasgow was beyond that airlines control, but the chaos that occurred in Keflavik could have been avoided. All flights to North America were delayed and boarding was chaotic. For an airline touting itself as a good alternative to Europe, they seem to have not been able to handle the volume well. Once on the plane, the flight was smooth, service good. The final flight was on an aged Boeing 757 with bad USB connections.

### "affordable and hassle free"
I had four flights with Icelandair. London - Seattle, then Anchorage - London, both via Iceland. The first two flights were full but it was not a problem. The seats were comfortable, the toilets kept clean. The return flights were not so full so even better. I had researched and knew to take my own food. On the return flights I purchased food on board. Soft drinks, tea and coffee are provided free. I was very pleased with this airline and will use them to get to Alaska again. The prices were very reasonable and the flight time quite short. Transiting through Keflavik is a lot nicer than going through U.S customs. I am so happy to have found an affordable and hassle free way to get to Alaska.

### "I was pleasantly surprised"
The flight from YVR to AMS was delayed by 2 hours with very little information being provided by the gate attendants. That was frustrating because my onward connection in Reykjavik to Amsterdam was 2 hours from the time of landing, so I could kiss that goodbye. In fairness, the gate attendants did not actually work for Icelandair, and when I called the toll free line, I was answered promptly, and given correct information right away (which I passed along to other passangers). They had to shuttle us to the plane on the tarmac, but as the customer services agent informed me on the phone, we did depart exactly 2 hours late. The plane and seats were very comfortable, the in-flight entertainment was great (despite what others have written), the music selection was the best of any airline I have been on, and staff were very friendly. The food and beer were quite nice too (Icelandic beer tends to be excellent), and the 7 hour trip really did not feel that long. When I got to Reykjavik, the agents did a wonderful job at helping me find alternative flights to get me to my destination as soon as possible. I ended up going through Oslo to Amsterdam via SAS, but it was an acceptable solution and well coordinated. I was satisfied with the outcome. The flight back I upgraded to business class for $120! The seat were comfortable, spacious, and the entertainment set was massive. I particularly enjoyed the programs pertaining to Iceland that were produced specifically for Iceland Air. It may have been a bit of a tough start, but the recovery was fantastic, and I would definitely recommend Icelandair again. Yes, no food or premium drinks are free, but for the amount I saved, I certainly cannot complain. Give them a try. I was pleasantly surprised.

### "definitely fly with them again"
New York to London via Reykjavik. I had a pleasant experience, but I'm glad I did a bit of research here before my flights and had a better idea of what to expect. I would agree that in many respects Icelandair is a budget airline masquerading as something a bit posher. You can't beat an $875 roundtrip fare, but I do think the company should be more explicit about what isn't included with their basic economy seats - namely, no included food or snacks and limited in-flight entertainment options. Neither of these things were that big of a deal to me on my four 3-5 hour flights, but had I been traveling further it would have been cumbersome. I did appreciate functioning USB ports in the backs of each seat for phone charging and on-screen controls for the TVs rather than on the armrests. Check in procedures and personnel at the Keflavik airport take "no frills" to a whole new level. Self check in kiosks are obviously the norm by now for most airlines, but I can't say I've ever had to then also print out and tag, scan, and route my own checked luggage; there was also no boarding announcement for my Reykjavik to New York flight in a cramped, chaotic gate area where three flights were boarding at the same time. Minor quips aside, all flights were on time and attendants efficient and cordial. For the amount of money I saved traveling via IcelandAir as opposed to flying direct to London on another airline (well over a thousand dollars), I would definitely fly with them again.

### "a nice characterful airline"
The Icelandair flight from Keflavik to Manchester was fine: they serve basic drinks for free, and offer snacks like porridge and biscuits for a charge. The menu was OK, but not much for people with dietary restrictions, for a longer flight, you'd want to take your own things. The seat was comfortable enough, and the boarding/disembarkation processes very smooth. Icelandair is a nice characterful airline: the planes are named after volcanoes, the lighting in the cabin is like the Northern Lights, and thing like cups, bags and napkins contain Icelandic words and short text about them. They even have a nice inflight safety video that reflects the airline's Nordic roots.

### "ridiculous baggage booking system"
Icelandair from Birmingham to Keflavik return. Ridiculous additional baggage booking system. Very long delays on way to and from Iceland on account of their baggage payment system not being updated. On arrival at the airport, having purchased an additional stowed bag the day before, with funds proven to have been taken by Iceland Air (online banking, shown to checkin staff), the airport system was showing an extra charge of over £80. After a lot of waiting, calls to offices and shuffling of paperwork they cleared our bags and the (already paid) fee. The reason, that their system had not refreshed with our payment! On the return, after booking the bag a week in advance, the same issue occurred! Unhelpful service staff again scratched their heads at this seemingly simple task. Such a basic feature of airlines should not be so archaic. Aircraft actually clean, with entertainment, so a step up there from other cheap airlines, but small reprieve for the administration issues!

### "cost well below other airlines"
We flew Washington Dulles to Reykjavik and back over the New Year's Eve 2015 holiday on Saga Class. In general, this business class is comparable to domestic US short haul first class: seats are reasonably but not overly spacious and don't recline very far (not optimal for a redeye flight). The food is good, inflight entertainment is satisfactory and service was attentive. Although not up to quality international business class standards, the Saga Class cost is well below that of other airlines flying across the Atlantic, and that is a definite plus.

### "so considerate and helpful"
Zurich to Toronto via Reykjavik with Icelandair. I got stuck in Europe due to Brussels airport being closed, and had to look for last-minute flights back to Canada. Icelandair were, by far, the best value for money. I was very lucky to find a flight with them that cost less than half what other airlines were charging. I had a flight connection in Reykjavik and unfortunately, my first flight was delayed leaving me only 10 minutes to make my connection, and I was certain that I would miss my connection and be stuck in Iceland. However, Icelandair  staff were so helpful. There was someone waiting for me as soon as I stepped off the plane, they handed me my boarding card and escorted me to my gate, where I realized that they'd held the next flight for me. Thank you Icelandair for being so considerate and helpful and making my trip home so much less stressful than it would otherwise have been!

### "light refreshment is served"
Oslo to Keflavik with Icelandair, and flight was on time. In flight entertainment is available, but no headphone is provided, need to bring your own earphone. USB is found next to the screen. Light refreshment like tea, coffee, water, soft drink is served. Alcoholic drink can be purchased. Magazine is informative. Wifi available with charges. Cabin crew isn't polite when request second glass of water.

### "flight was very comfortable"
Icelandair service was great. When checking in at Keflavík, I used a self-check in machine which was very simple and there were staff available to assist. Bag drop was a very quick procedure. The flight was very comfortable, lots of legroom, amazing IFE system and the flight attendants were lovely. On time departure and arrival.

### "new style seats uncomfortable"
Toronto to Paris CDG via Keflavik with Icelandair. The flight crew for our flights were great and plane interiors were generally clean - it is good to break-up a flight to Europe with a stop for about an hour mid-way, especially when you're traveling with children. However, on the negative end, the planes are too narrow for such long flights, the new style seats are uncomfortable and the armrests don't rise between many seats which is a complete failure of set-up given people like to cozy with family members when traveling or take advantage of an empty seat. You also have to pay for meals in economy class (which is actually not too bad tasting) unless you have Saga points you've accumulated from a prior flight. Keflavik is a nice, small airport, but it is also an absolute zoo for flights taking off to North America. And they don't even board the planes with announcements or any sort of organization there. It's mayhem.

### "pleasant on board crew"
Flew Icelandair from Gatwick to Keflavik. Generally a clean aircraft with pleasant on board crew. Particularly liked the personal TV screen but do remember to take your own earphones. Food selection was okay but, on the return, could have taken a meal on board from the airport for a better selection. Check in efficient with Keflavik now fully automated. Security was rapid at both Gatwick and Keflavik. However check in desk staff at Gatwick did not know about upgrades. I'd intended to pay for an up grade at the airport but this is not possible at the check in desk nor was it possible at their service partner desk, (where a minimum of 24 hours notice is needed).

### "look forward to flying again"
Wonderful Icelandair flight. My daughter had a headache due to the cabin pressure change. The cabin staff were very helpful, offering all the help they could give. There were some difficulties to begin with due to incompetent ground staff in Munich but Icelandair solved these problems in a professional and satisfactory manner. I look forward to flying with this airline again.

### "not close to being worth it"
Seattle to Frankfurt via Keflavik with Icelandair. I saved a few dollars. Not even close to being worth it. - 7:30 hours on a flight with one visit by the beverage cart. Uncomfortable seats, uncomfortably warm during the entire flight. Food options very limited. Icelandair has a great marketing plan - but they should bill themselves as a budget airline because that's exactly what it feels like.

### "terrible carrier and flights"
Seattle to Frankfurt via Seattle.My experience with Icelandair has to rank down there with all of my terrible carriers and flights. I would not recommend them to any of my friends. Old movies, 90 degrees in the cabin, uncomfortable seats, you have to pay for drinks and food on an international flight, and what food is on the plan is some of the worst I have had. For a 7.5 hour segment we had to pay for 2 bottles of red wine, a candy bar, and box of chips. There wasn't even coffee prior to the flight arriving in Reykjavík or Frankfurt. The crew only made one trip through at about 30 minutes into the flight and was never seen again. No water, no help - no way. If Icelandair promoted themselves as a Ryanair type carrier, then I would have been prepared. But I thought folks liked the services and food on this airline - sorry I found out that it has neither. I have two more trips scheduled to Europe this year and I will not be booking with Icelandair for those. This was an experiment gone wrong with an experience that I have never had with another international carrier. I am sure going to Iceland is exciting, but getting there or transiting through should be a better experience.

### "refund policy is terrible"
Icelandair is okay in business class, but refund policy is terrible if you use one way of the round trip ticket. I traveled to to Europe with Icelandair and came home a day early because of January east coast blizzard. Their refund math is atrocious. You take the highest one way price ever ever sold and then get the balance back. But, they use such a high price for the one way that really there is probably hardly ever a refund. I am used to airlines that do simple math - you paid this each way you get that back. Not Icelandair business class. I emailed complaint to CEO. No response at all from any assistant.

### "nice touch was the northern lights show"
My wife and I flew Icelandair from Gatwick to Keflavik return on a B757. Both flights were full and on time. We had exit row seats on the outbound flight which I found to be very hard and uncomfortable, on the return we had normal seats which were far better, plenty of leg room for a 3 hour trip. Complementary hot and cold beverages served. A nice touch was the northern lights show played on the cabin roof above the lockers.

### "the fare was reasonable"
Icelandair is like Scandinavian Airlines. It takes you to your destination with minimum frills. On this Keflavik to London flight I pre-ordered mini-burgers and a baguette for my travelling companion. The food was delivered shortly after take-off. Juice, coffee and tea were complimentary. The IFE system showed a documentary on the Northern Lights which was wonderful. Having just seen the Northern Lights in Iceland, I appreciated the documentary. At GBP 82, the fare was reasonable for a 3-hour flight - cheaper than a London-Edinburgh train ticket.

### "9 days missing luggage"
Orlando to Glasgow via Keflavik on Icelandair. Inflight issue - 2 of 4 video screens did not work. Connecting flight with a 9 hour delay. Luggage : 9 days missing luggage with no customer support or luggage in sight! Nothing says Merry Christmas like having presents in a missing piece of luggage. Thank you Icelandair.

### "Icelandic hospitality superb"
I booked Icelandair Premium Economy which provides free access to the Plaza Premium lounge at Toronto Pearson, and was a wonderful start to the flight with hot food, alcohol and drinks, plus sandwiches wrapped in shrinkwrap for you to take on your flight. Economy Comfort class also offers priority boarding. Happily, I received an operational upgrade to business class at the gate! A stewardess offered me a glass of cava, bottle of water, noise cancelling headphones and offered to hang up my coat. I was sat in 2D which has a floor cut out for extra legroom and storage. The seats don't fully recline but are comfortable, much like US domestic first class seats. The lack of a footrest and adjustable headrest made sleeping less comfortable. I was offered drinks by a very friendly and helpful crew, and dinner was excellent. Me nor my seat mate could connect to wi-fi on our iphones. I made use of the Saga lounge at KEF which offered a nice selection of food and drink but no hot food, which would have been preferable but the lounge is clean, and peaceful with comfortable seats. The leg to LHR was back in Economy Comfort but in a business class seat without the full service, which is often the case in rows 5 and 6. I slept the whole way to London. The experience was excellent and I found Icelandic hospitality superb.

### "seating was surprisingly comfortable"
A few years ago I had flown with Icelandair and was not so impressed. I booked with them again recently from KEF to JFK, primarily to save money. This time around I was very pleased. The crew were very friendly, helpful and efficient, and the seating was surprisingly comfortable. The food, although not free, was probably the best I have ever had on a flight. Flying with Icelandair is a good way to save money and to break up a long trip into smaller portions, easier to cope with. Also, it provides the opportunity to spend some time in Iceland with its breathtaking one of a kind landscape.

### "disappointed with the service"
Frankfurt to Denver via Reykjavik. I took Icelandair because of the baggage allowance which was very good but I was disappointed with the service staff and the fact that I flew 13 hours with them and they didn't offer a meal on the plane. I had to buy food. Every other airline I've ever flown this long distances with has provided two meals. How can you let your passengers for 13 hours without food? Also the flight attendants seemed very annoyed all the time. I would fly with them again if need be as the seats were okay and the entertainment selection wasn't awful. However I highly suggest they encourage their staff to be more pleasant and give their customers at least one meal. It is not okay to let your passengers go that long without something to eat.

### "was given no assistance"
I am a part time wheelchair user and had booked disabled assistance at both airports which worked well. I had struggled to get Icelandair to accept that I needed to take an extra carry on bag full of essential medication with me (I couldn't risk being away for a week and it getting lost in transfer) but once I'd had the agreement that all went very well. I was appalled however at the way I was treated by the cabin staff. Despite being pushed to the door in a wheelchair and then getting out my stick to help me walk, I was given no assistance with either of my carry on bags, when I asked where my seat was I was just told "down there" with a wave. I am unable to reach the overhead lockers so had to rely on asking a stranger to help me and put my bags away for me. Once we landed I sat and waited for all the able bodied people to depart (standard procedure), but I and another lady who was also disabled then just sat there and were totally ignored by the crew. I couldn't attract anyone's attention, fortunately the same nice stranger had already got my bags down for me. In the end I had to get up and ask where my wheelchair was, again I got a wave of the head and a verbal "down there at the front". No assistance was offered. I then said that the other lady needed assistance and it was given with a bit of a "well if I have to" flounce. I have written to their customer services and interested to see what response I get. On the return journey I was travelling with EasyJet and they were fabulous - which made me realise just how bad the Icelandair experience had been.

### "simple food options for purchase"
Icelandair check in at KEF was a breeze. Utilizing the mobile check-in option meant that there was no line at baggage drop-off. Icelandair offers good baggage allowance for leisure passengers. KEF is struggling to keep up with the explosion in tourism in Iceland and it shows. Very busy, few seating facilities and unless you have access to a lounge, only overpriced food and drinks options. Nice flight to Norway in a Boeing 757-300. Essentially a stretch version of the 757-200 it offers a higher number of seats, while still being single aisle. On this flight the wifi was working and working well. Not a completely full plane, but still busy on this short flight to Trondheim via Bergen. Icelandair is efficient, if nothing more than that and has done itself a favour with the upgraded entertainment system. Too bad the selections seem somewhat limited, but I managed to finish a movie on the way. You'll get some simple food options for purchase - sandwich etc. Wouldn't hesitate to fly with them again.

### "very generous baggage allowance"
First time with Icelandair from Glasgow to New York JFK via Keflavik. Super smooth check in from Glasgow (2 hours flight) 1 Hour 50 minutes in Iceland then 5 hours to JFK. Plenty of legroom and comfortable seating for Economy. Very generous baggage allowance. Plenty of soft drinks, teas and coffee. Price Excellent. Would definitely fly Icelandair again.

### "a good experience"
My wife and I were in economy for the short flight to and from Reykjavik from Gatwick. Having flown BA economy to and from Paphos in Cyprus in September, we were struck at how much better the set up on the Icelandair planes were. We had excellent leg room and the seats seemed wider with a better pitch. Icelandair also had a painless process for online check in and the pre-flight notifications were helpful - eg. on our flight they had no individual screens and emailed us to advise that individual iPads would be available. The only slight disappointment was the bag drop queue but it was Sunday afternoon so clearly a number of flights leaving at the same time, and in fairness they had every desk open and processed the queue pretty quickly. All in all a good experience and would definitely recommend this airline.

### "would consider Icelandair again"
London to Washington via Keflavik with Icelandair. Comfortable aircraft on all legs with polite cabin crew. Complementary soft drinks, however there were too few drinks services. Due to the low price, I would consider Icelandair again.

### "attendants are polite"
Amsterdam to New York via Keflavik. I have flown on Icelandair many times from Boston or NY to Amsterdam with a stopover in Keflavik, as my daughter lives in Amsterdam. I always fly Saga Class. The planes are great, clean and modern, the seats are comfortable, the food is good, the attendants are always polite and helpful. The lounges in Boston, New York, Amsterdam and Keflavik are really nice. However I hate the transfer in Keflavik. As many times as I've been there that airport is confusing and it's unclear how to proceed. There is no priority seating for Saga Class. If you wait in the lounge, when you get to the gate to depart it is mobbed and you either have to go upstairs or downstairs. The only way to (partially) avoid the crush of people on the stairs is to forego the lounge. On one transfer we had to take a shuttle to the next flight. Not many seats, clearly it was meant for a lot of people to stand. They left the doors open to the cold for quite a while as the shuttle filled. It was annoying and uncomfortable. On my last transfer, from KEF to JFK they took away my carry on bag and checked it. That exact suitcase has flown on countless flights on many airlines including Icelandair on the way over. On our next flight to Amsterdam we're not taking Icelandair. I expect we will again at some point. I really hope by that time they improve the transfer at Keflavik. Skipping it would be even better.

### "regretted paying for Saga Class"
Disappointed would be an understatement. When I booked this travel, well in advance, it was under impressions I got from reputable reviewers online. I also considered that a breakup of travel to get to my destination would help with some of the discomfort that comes with long haul flights. Overall, my trip was roundtrip from the US to England, via Keflavik. The usage of Air France's lounge at KIAD was very acceptable and they offered a decent selection of food and drink. The flight to KEF was decent, but nothing mind blowing. The selection of entertainment, once mentioned as the best of any airline, must have come from an Icelandic native, because about half of the entertainment offered was from the native country. The rest of the entertainment was recycled TV shows and movies from the US which was not very appealing. WiFi connections, or lack thereof, was an end result to my disappointment. Seeing as though I was seated in Saga Class, I could connect for free, but this was not possible at all. I had issues with it and even after mentioning it to a flight attendant, they really didn't seem to care. The meal service was decent as well. I was prepared for delicacies that hailed from Iceland, but a few things were hard to swallow. There was a general lack of care by the flight crew on all four flights, which again was a bit disheartening, considering where I sat. Overall, I regretted paying for Saga Class when I barely got the benefits. A layover in BIKF required that I pass through Passport Control, who puts an airline lounge outside of the gate area? Most airports I have been to, have the lounges at the gates, avoiding the needless security check. I had to skip out on that benefit due to a strike going on at Passport Control which would have eventually led to me missing my flights. Yeah, I am going to have to rethink my airline of choice next year. Icelandair left a bad first impression that I am not so easily forgiving to try to them again.

### "not be flying Icelandair again"
Boston to Manchester via Reykjavik. Booked this flight as it said we would arrive in Manchester in time for my husband to get home and have enough time to get to Old Trafford for the United v City match. We were due to take off at 8am. We were still sat on the plane, and did not taxi to runway until 9.30. Sad to say cabin crew kept a very low profile and in the time we sat waiting only 1 message from the pilot. It goes without saying we will not be flying with Icelandair again.

### "last time I fly Icelandair"
Washington to Manchester via Keflavik. When I booked my flight to Manchester, I did not realize Icelandair was a low cost airline as their prices matched other major carriers (United for instance). I was surprised when I got on board that I had to pay for my food, beverages, being used to complimentary food and liquor on other major airlines. When we landed in Rejavik, there was a snow storm and they litteraly opened the doors to the outside and had us walk 30-40 metres to the terminal in the snow. My flight from Rekjavik to Manchester was delayed 2 hours because they needed to defrost the plane. This is the North Pole pretty much and they were acting like this was their encounter with snow. This is my first and last time I fly Icelandair.

### "most uncomfortable flights"
Flew Icelandair Saga class from Stockholm to New York and it was one of the most uncomfortable flights I have experienced. The seat reclined only slightly and left me at an angle so I couldn't sit properly nor lie down and instead spent the duration of the flight trying to keep in my seat without sliding down. In fact I preferred standing in the aisle which I did quite a. Lot. It was twice the price of a flight with Norwegian but everything about the flight was worse except the fact that it was more or less on time. When I flew its Norwegian it was greatly delayed. The service was mediocre - the food passable - toilets old and not kept clean for the duration of the flight . No priority boarding nor disembarking and the tagged priority luggage was not prioritized! From now on I will have to fly SAS and suck up the added expense. I suppose there is a reason they are so much more expensive.

### "seats in Boeing 757s behind the times"
Flew Denver to Keflavik return in Saga Class which is Icelandair's version of premium class. Both the flights were on time. Inflight service was efficient. Ground service at American airport was good but at Keflavík chaos reigns. Whereas at American gateways Saga Class passengers have priority in boarding, no such courtesy is extended at Keflavík which is the home of Icelandair. The Saga Class seats in Icelandair Boeing 757s are behind the times, more in line with US domestic First Class. The wifi was complimentary in Saga Class. The Saga Class lounge at Keflavík is a quiet refuge and on this visit I saw that the vegetarian offerings had been expanded. But no such luck on the flights where the vegetarian pickings were slim.

### "a confortable flight"
Nowadays is becoming rare to fly a 757 in Europe. Icelandair seat provided a confortable flight for legroom and confort. Flight was on time. The downside with Icelandair is the low cost policy, and everything on board is on sale (save a glass of water). In general a good experience, but no food is served.

### "not worth their discount price"
I flew Icelandair in May from Toronto to Munich via Keflavik. The airline was what is expected for a low budget airline. However they lost my luggage, as accidents happen I decided to give Icelandair a second chance and recommended it to my parents as the halfway layover is convenient. My parents had a terrible experience in the way over as they were forced to go through the basement and then take a bus to their connecting flight and then go through security a second time, causing them to almost miss their flight despite the fact that their first flight arrived in time. On their way home arrived to the airport to find a massive check in line, there were no check in machines and only 2 people working at the counter. The people moved extremely slow and were very rude. Overall the airline appears to be very unorganized and unhelpful. They are not worth their discount price!

### "Icelandair went above my expectations "
For a low budget airline, Icelandair provides exceptional service. During a recent trip to Europe, my flight out of Toronto was late to take off and I ended up missing my connecting flight to Frankfurt from Keflavik. However, Icelandair was able to make my experience very positive by providing a clear explanation for the delay, being apologetic for the inconvenience and providing detailed information on what to do during a 24 hours layover in Iceland. Icelandair paid for a hotel room, transportation and 3 meals during my unexpected stay in Iceland. At the Icelandair Hotel in Keflavik, the front desk agent even looked up bus schedules for me. The customer service at Icelandair went above my expectations and I would recommend it to a friend.

### "staff polite enough, not over friendly"
Decent enough flight with Icelandair from Manchester to Newark via Keflavik. Outward, everything was on time. Bit confused at Keflavik, as wasn't sure what to do re onward flight. Basically, you arrive into a large waiting area with an expensive self service cafe. We were lucky, as we arrived, there were few passengers, 20 minutes later another 2 flights had arrived and there was nowhere to sit. 2 hour stopover passed fairly quickly. You just check the board and sit near your gate. No delays. 2 small bottles of water given to you as you board 2nd part of flight to Newark. Tea, coffee, soft drinks are complimentary. Entertainment ok. Passenger next to my son had a faulty screen and was given an Ipad. Return flight fine. Only offered one drink in 5 and a half hours, but it is overnight. Experienced no problems really, staff polite enough, although not over friendly. I would fly with them again. My only real problem was flying back, the ignorant middle aged male passenger directly in front of me, immediately reclined his seat after take off, although there is very little room. I am 5 ft 10, and have limited mobility and so was very uncomfortable for 5 and a half hours. My only consolation was that the person in front of his wife across the aisle, did exactly the same to her. Some people clearly have no thought for anyone but themselves. Of course, in the scheme of things, not the end of the world.

### "not seen lax attitude like Icelandair before"
I have not seen a lax attitude like Icelandair before. Flight got delayed from FRA to KEF, no problem. But at KEF, it took them 15 minutes just to get the airbridge connected. KEF-DEN is delayed, we were supposed to get a different plane and new seat number. While a bunch of us waited at KEF airport, there was no announcement at all about our new DEN flight. Fortunately, a girl asked me has DEN boarded? We went to the gate to check and the staff was like "Oh yeah, you're the last one to board the plane. Excuse me, there are at least 10 more people behind us. US$3 for SKYR yogurt that was half full and no food service for 8 hours long flight.

### "it was calm, efficient, good value"
Newark to Gatwick via Reykjavik on Icelandair, and it was calm, efficient, good value. We took our own sandwiches, but the menu items for sale on the plane looked quite good, not outrageously expensive and are brought to your seat if you pre-order. There are few flight options from Gatwick to New York these days but this choice worked out well for us. Here are some tips if you are travelling through Reykjavik between two non-Schengen countries (eg. UK to USA). You don't go through passport control or customs till you reach your final destination. Instead, when you disembark in Reykjavik you are in a Transit Lounge that has a duty free shop, a cafe, limited seating and all the gates for connecting flights. The gates are just gates: they don't have their own seating areas. When you arrive, check the departure date for your connecting flight and claim seats nearby. With that as your base camp, your partner and you can take it in turns to visit the other facilities/return with a tray of refreshments (try the Skyr: a low fat yoghurt/cheese Icelandic speciality).

### "assigned seats all over the aircraft"
My family of 14 flew Icelandair from Washington to London with a transit in Reykjavik, Iceland. I bought these tickets eight months ahead of time. I checked and confirmed all seats for all 14 of us. However, when we checked-in in IAD, even thought we arrived to check in early enough, we were assigned different seats all over the aircraft. The arm rest in between seats on the flight to Reykjavik could not be lifted up. I I could not lay down the 4 year old daughter to take a nap between seats. There was a technical issue and more than an hour delay when we left Washington DC. That made us miss the connection flight in Reykjavik. Icelandair reconnected all of us go to London via Manchester. The flight from Reykjavik okay. However, Icelandair did not have a boarding pass for my 4 year old daughter. I only knew the customs in Manchester kept asking her boarding pass when we walked from terminal to terminal. I had never thought they missed her for the flight to London. The staff in customer service desk in Manchester told me that flight was fully booked. That was terrible. Eventually, she got all 14 of us on that flight to London.

### Icelandair customer review
Travelled with 2 small children. Good value for money. Meals for adults prebooked and standard economy class food / same standard as Easyjet. Children given attractive food boxes on all legs (no need to pay on aircraft or pre book). Children given excellent entertainment pack with cards, colouring packs, headphones and a cleverly designed blanket which folded into a backpack for the longhaul legs. Crew caring and considerate. Preboarding for those with families. Very generous baggage allowance included in price of ticket. Quick connecting times. Leather Recaro seat with good legroom for economy class. Inflight entertainment screen good but the choice of music and films dated and very limited. TV programmes tended to be pilot programmes - this was the only inflight downside. Nice flying on small aircraft that are quick to load and unload. Before you fly it is made quite clear that adults will not be fed nor will there be alcohol unless you pay. Another downside is that while Keflavek airport was very easy to transit through, it is absolutely filthy and in need of a deep clean as this clearly does not happen between the waves of flights.

### Icelandair customer review
I purchased a round trip Icelandair business class ticket New York to Norway via a short stopover in Iceland. Overall, I have mixed feelings regarding Icelandair's Saga class. Icelandair seems very nonchalant about opening their ticket counters at the scheduled times. At JFK, agents didn't arrive until 11:10am, although their notice stated they would open at 10:30am. While I don't know if this was a specific issue about JFK, it was nevertheless frustrating. One of the chief reasons for buying a more expensive ticket is that Business class tickets allow you to utilize the express line when going through airport security; however, you can't do this with Icelandair. As it was explained to me by one of the security agents in Oslo, Icelandair will not pay the fees all airlines have to apparently pay for the fast-track security check, thus preventing all their passengers from using it. Icelandair does not open a specific counter for Business class ticket holders, nor do they allow  Business class passengers to board their planes before Economy passengers. On the face of it, this appears very egalitarian of them; unfortunately, what this means is that all passengers get to experience a jumbled mass of frantic pushing once the "now boarding" announcement is called. Obviously, this wouldn't be an issue if people didn't behave in such a manner, but this always seems to happen, regardless of the country. To conclude, my primary reasons for buying a more expensive ticket was that I thought I'd be able to avoid the massive security lines and the boarding frenzy, which are two things I personally don't like. With Icelandair Saga class, you're going to have to experience this whether you like it or not. Is the food or service better in Saga class? While I can't say, my hunch is Icelandair treats all its passengers quite equally. As such, I don't think you're getting anything more for the money with Saga class, and your flight on Icelandair would be just as good in Economy.

### Icelandair customer review
My boyfriend and I were quite pleased, despite a few glitches, with our recent flight to Minneapolis on Icelandair. Check-in at Arlanda was a tad slow but border agents were friendly enough. Our flight was full to Reykjavik but the seats were surprisingly roomy so you didn't feel too cramped. We landed uneventfully in Iceland with our hour layover and once past border control, we ended up standing in a huge queue for our next flight along hundreds of other passengers flying to Boston, Washington DC and Toronto. To our surprise, there weren't any waiting areas at these gates so for at least a half hour, it felt like we were cattle amongst our fellow passengers. Boarding, thankfully, began on time, so it was onto our next leg of the flight. I believe Icelandair's entertainment system to be quite good but unfortunately both my boyfriend and I had systems that didn't work at all so we couldn't enjoy it. One of the male flight attendants was very sweet and helpful, though, offering to give us complimentary beverages or snacks, but for this 6-hour flight, we felt that wasn't enough. Luckily I had downloaded enough movies on my iPad to watch and my boyfriend had his Kindle, otherwise we would have been bored and restless. The flight was very smooth, making it a pretty uneventful flight. These planes could definitely use an upgrade (and a thorough cleaning), since you can tell they've seen better days. But, for the total flying time it took for us to arrive at our destination, and the value for money, it was a pretty pleasant experience.

Despite unfortunate delays in Halifax, I compliment the crew for a very enjoyable, if late fight. Polite,  efficient service from crew. Excellent food with an Islandic flavor and excellent selection of wines and schnapps. Comfy if a little dated seats. Outstanding airport experience. Found some great local sweaters in the shops.

### Icelandair customer review
Surprisingly good experience and good value for money. The check in was efficient, seating comfortable and spacious. Crew were friendly and efficient, food for sale on board was of good quality and the inflight entertainment good for such a short flight.

### Icelandair customer review
We waited two hours, past our departure time before they loaded the plane. An hour later, they unloaded us. We waited for 45 minutes before we got another plane, and then it was not running either. We arrived four plus hours after our scheduled time. All connecting flights were already gone, so they said good luck. We had to spend the night in Seattle, with no help, or reservations. Everyone passed it off to someone else to help us. We were given a piece of paper that said we had a flight the next day at 9.40 am. When we showed up at the airport, the connecting airline was confused by our piece of paper. We had to go to a special line and untangle the mess.

### Icelandair customer review
Icelandair employees are borderline rude and completely lacking in the concept of customer service. From start to finish, the experience was stressful and left me angry. To begin with, I tried to check in online using the email sent to me, but the boarding passes would not download, no matter how many times I tried. When we got to the airport we discovered an extremely long line of people wanting to check in, I asked an employee if having checked in online we could avoid the line. She said no. So what is the point of online check-in? When we finally got to check in, the agent was silent, even though she could have, and should have, warned us that the line through security was impossibly long such that there was no way we were going to get to the gate on time. People were pushing and yelling and breaking the line, trying to make their flights. No airport or airline personnel was in sight to offer assistance. Finally, after more than an hour, a person in a uniform - unidentified - pushed a man in front of us and said that he needed to make his flight that would be leaving in a few minutes. At that point, we were already beyond the boarding time for our flight. The person turned to us and said "they are holding the flights. No other information was forthcoming. When we finally got to where we could see the security people, it was immediately obvious why it was taking so long. Only one screening station was open! Unbelieveable. We had to run at full speed to the gate, and were the last people they let board. Who knows if there were people who were less fortunate. we had no time at the airport to change our money or apply for the tax refund. So this all cost me more than it should have. We loved Iceland, but thanks to Icelandair I will never go back.

### Icelandair customer review
Planes were comfortable, plenty of inflight entertainment, flights on time and arrived a little earlier than scheduled. Prices were incredibly good, however they do fluctuate day to day so make sure you check dates around when you'd like to fly - they may be a lot cheaper on other days. The only drawbacks was getting through check ins on the flight back. We ended up being separated on the plane which, with me being a nervous flyer, didn't bode well. Also the queues for check in at Keflavik were rather long even though we were effectively just dropping our bags off. On the whole though, excellent! It would be nice if airlines didn't capitalise on the fact that if you are hungry or thirsty you have to pay over the odds for food and drink, although this is the same for many airlines.

### Icelandair customer review
My expectations were low for Saga Class because the price was half of what I would have paid for Business Class on most transatlantic carriers. That being said, I was pleasantly surprised. The good: Air France Lounge access in BOS was excellent. Check in was great. Saga Lounge in Reykjavik was excellent. Nice AF lounge in Frankfurt. I did a two day layover in Iceland which I enjoyed. The food was good to excellent. I preordered each meal. The lamb was the best choice. I found the crew to be very pleasant and accommodating onboard. The 'less than good': Remote stands in Reykjavik. Not a problem arriving, but leaving was very uncomfortable. They loaded and loaded and loaded folks onto that bus. We waited and kept waiting with the door open and a cold gale coming through. Seriously? They couldn't get another bus? Finally, the flight from KEF to FRA was full in Saga Class with Icelandair execs and their spouses. They were some of the most obnoxious, demanding, and rude passengers I have ever encountered. They got their luggage hand delivered in FRA before any other passengers.

### Icelandair customer review
I just had 4 flights on Icelandair in the past 2 weeks and they were all excellent. The in-flight entertainment systems were working on all 4 flights, they were all basically on time except for one that was about 45 minutes late taking off. All of the planes seemed in good shape to me and were clean. The seats in economy were much roomier than other airlines I've been on. Plenty of leg room. I have had issues with the seat belts being tight on other airlines and this is the first time I have had plenty of extra slack with the seat belt. I also found the seats to be a little wider than what I have experienced in the past. I did purchase a couple of snack items from their menu and they were very good. They offer a wide selection of items to eat for many different tastes. The attendants were all excellent, going out of their way to help and bring pillows, blankets, headphones, etc. I noticed one lady was offered an iPad to watch when her screen wasn't working and another passenger was moved to an empty seat to be more comfortable. I myself was offered a seat up in SAGA class when I mentioned I wasn't feeling well. I did not take them up on it but I appreciated the offer being made. I think this is a really good airline and they do not seem budget in any way even though their low prices tell a different story. I would highly recommend them to anyone.

### Icelandair customer review
I have flown Icelandair about 5 times across the Atlantic since 2012. First the positive: at the time it was the only airline which allowed rescheduling of flights for no fee or a very low fee. The lounge in Reykjavik is quite good and the Reykjavik Airport is very nice. There are plenty of negatives with this airline. First of all the planes are quite old and it shows. Staff can be unfriendly if not outright rude. I had numerous delays and one time I got stuck at Reykjavik airport for an entire day. The first alternate plane had an engine failure and the second must have been one of the oldest Boeing 757s in service. I would not recommend them. There are better alternatives now to fly across the Atlantic.

### Icelandair customer review
We were looking forward to our first Icelandair trip with a 2 day stopover in Reykjavik. Flight over to Oslo via Reykjavik was uneventful, lack of food choices disappointing, and personal entertainment did not work! Different story on the flight home - we waited over .5 hours to check in, only 2 counters open plus 1 at Saga desk who just sat there most of the time! At boarding time we could not hear, I asked what rows were called and gate attendant snapped at me, and others. Flight leaving Reykjavik 90 minutes late - this happens so no big deal. Seemed to be great confusion, between boarding staff and flight crew - scanned in, but then waited in hallway over over 30 minutes to board. Personal entertainment did not work on either flights (so 3 out 4) even with resetting. Plane was dirty, Flight attendants friendly and offered to change my seat. I would have, but traveling with my wife. Will think twice before flying them again.

### Icelandair customer review
LGW-KEF-PDX, PDX-KEF, KEF-LHR. I flew to Portland to visit friends with a 4 day stopover on the way back in Iceland which is included at no extra cost. I think I agree with the review by M Brown on the 20th March, people are being are rather unfair particularly with regards to the catering situation on Icelandair - they are very clear on what the product being offered here is and there is opportunity once booked to add food from the regular menu at a discount before flying and this is served to you before the main food service begins. I only pre-ordered food outbound on the long-haul KEF-PDX sector and found what was served to be delicious and good value. All non-alcoholic drinks are complimentary and can be requested at any time during the flight. All sectors were on B757, which whilst relatively old were immaculately maintained. Outbound from Gatwick the plane was a bit older and had no IFE, but this was ok for the short flight to Reykjavík and I was notified 24hrs prior to departure of this via text. On the long-haul sector from Keflavík to Portland the aircraft was more the Icelandair standard product and we were presented with bottle of Icelandic water which was a nice touch. There was IFE on this sector but it was very old, with poor quality picture and didn't have a fantastic selection - but I had brought my own entertainment with me anyway. The staff however on this flight were fantastic and really worked hard to be friendly and attentive to passengers needs so much so I will be writing to Icelandair to tell them so! Flying back to Reykjavík was pleasant with blankets and cushions provided for this overnight sector and IFE was newer and the the best of all the sectors with a clear picture. My return to London a few days later was also fine with everything on schedule and generally pleasant. One thing that didn't work on any sector was mobile boarding passes - this didn't work on a single sector for me, but I easily received a paper version in most cases. Apart from little niggles which made the experience less than perfect overall I was satisfied with my experience, it was fantastic value for money with the added plus of the stopover and would be very happy to use them again.

### Icelandair customer review
Connected with Icelandair from and to Estonian Air via Oslo outbound on June 8, 2015 and via Copenhagen homebound on June 14,Tallinn. On both flights electronic check-in and boarding were smooth, aircraft clean, seat pitch and legroom sufficient, departures and arrivals on time. FA attentive and nice on both flights. Inflight magazine was informative and pleasant. Negative aspects - the selection of meals and snacks in Economy for sale is poor and lack any imagination. The same goes for the in-flight entertainment.

### Icelandair customer review
Flew EWR-KEF and KEF-MUC on Economy Class. Reading some reviews I expected a bad experience but everything was fine. Checked in with my mobile phone in EWR, unfortunately the TSA couldn’t read the ticket so I had to go back to the Check in counter to get the boarding pass. Flight was on time and the crew was very friendly. Got an emergency exit seat during check in for free, so I had enough space but the standard Economy seats looked like they have good pitch. The only thing I couldn't deal with was the mood light, but I don´t like it on any airline. I just prefer a dark cabin during flight. Boarding the first flight everyone got a bottle of water, which was refilled during the trip, the crew offered drinks a few times during both legs. Food was for purchase and rather expensive but booking on the airline’s web site I knew that before so I had a nice dinner at EWR and bought some chips for the second leg to MUC. KEF is a very small and pleasant airport for transit. From the moment of disembarking to my connection flight I needed less than 10 minutes. I will definitively fly Icelandair again in the future, yet the planes are good and the two crews that attended my flights were excellent. And with 380 EUR the price was more than good.

### Icelandair customer review
A very comfortable well run flight. Excellent aircraft. Very good attentive service. Food and wine good choice and well presented. All flights arrived on time. Shame seats don't go completely flat but they do recline sufficiently to enable you to get some sleep.

### Icelandair customer review
We flew on a 3 week trip to Europe in Saga business class from Newark (EWR) to Munich (MUC). We took Icelandair up on its invite for a stop-over on our return trip. The flights were all on time. The only complaint we have is the way they board their passengers. On the American air carriers, the first and business class passengers are always boarded first prior to the economy class. The only time Icelandair did this was at Newark. At the European airports, everyone was asked to board at the same time. When we confronted Icelandair, they said they didn't have the facilities to do this. You don't need facilities. All you need is to use the microphone to call out asking for the Saga class to board. The wine choices were good. The food was typical airline food. The attention from the FA's was very good. If you want seat comfort for a long flight then Saga class is worth the money.

### Icelandair customer review
Delayed on board in Iceland we notified the flight attendant we would miss our connecting flight. The flight attendant said she spoke to the pilot and assured us someone would meet us when we departed from the plane in Munich to make sure we would be in front of the line to make our connecting flight. No one met us as promised to help us with our connecting flight. As a result we missed our connecting flight, our first day reservation and rental car and had to stay in Munich overnight. Eventually we read a news article concerning the pilot strike during this time; hence the delay. Customer service offered no compensation for missed flight. Relating to Mr Ferguson's review of May 2014:  "They lie to us and then want us to trust our lives to them". This definitely is a moral issue. We have flown Icelandair in the 1990's many times, however never again. Icelandair would do well to incorporate a business of taking care of problems for the good of their passengers.

### Icelandair customer review
We flew from Sanford FL to Keflavik. We were impressed. Unfortunately the return trip on June 2nd flight 1689 was just the opposite. Arriving at the check in counter the agent asked if we were flying together and issued our boarding passes. Checking our passes we realized we were not issued our reserved seats and would be seated separately. I returned to the counter to correct the seat assignment and was given numerous excuses (different aircraft the plane was full single seats throughout the plane etc.). Rather than resolving her mistake the agent told me the flight attendants would correct the seating once boarded. Upon boarding I spoke with a flight attendant regarding the seating situation. There was nothing he could do as the plane was at full occupancy. Going to take my assigned seat (window) there was a large man already in it and was reluctant to move. I claimed my seat. He became upset grunted throughout the flight and constantly extended himself into my space. Not only did I not sit with my friend - I was also deprived of having a full seat! The entire flight was extremely stressful and challenging. Whenever I got up the man would take my seat and tell me to sit in the middle. I had to put up with this situation over the course of almost eight hours! What is the purpose of reserving a seat if they are not going to respect the selection?

Flew ZRH-KEF-ZRH in May with Icelandair in Economy saver class and paid £379.55 incl. taxes. Flights were on time and boarding quick and easy. No meal or inflight entertainment on board due my selected fare however water tea and coffee were offered. Flight Attendants very friendly and helpful. Overall both journeys were pleasant and would fly with them again.

5/13/15 FL205 CPH to KEF Premium Economy. Aviators lounge in CPH was very nice benefit. Seats were comfortable and food and beverage was also good. Staff was friendly and service was great. Smooth on time flight. Baggage arrived undamaged. 5/16/15 FL613 KEF to JFK Premium Economy free upgrade to Saga Class. Same comments as above. The stopover benefit is a real plus. Certainly enjoyed our stay in Iceland and plan to return. Again aircraft crew was great.

April 20 flight 670. May 5 flight 671. Great prices and thought the staff were wonderful. Just thought I would give people a FYI-bring food! The food they offer at a cost is pretty humble so grab something nutritious before you board the plane.

LHR-KEF FI 0451 21st April 15. KEF-IAD FI 0645 21st April 15. IAD-KEF FI 0644 23rd April 15. KEF-LHR FI 0450 24th April 15. You get what you pay for. Do not expect a 'global' business class product but a service which reflects the cost of the ticket. The inflight service was excellent with very attentive crew taking wonderful care of you. The seat was very similar to the last generation of Lufthansa business class seats before they went 'angled bed'. Very quick and efficient transfer with a delightfully small airport. Aircraft old but appeared to be well maintained. The best thing of all was very few announcements and lights put out very quickly after take off on the overnight leg with a minimum of fuss. Intend to make FI a regular feature of my business travel plans.

### Icelandair customer review
I have flown Icelandair for the past 3 years. I flew Seattle to Manchester and returned the same route. I had a great experience. I brought my own food as I learned the hard way how expensive and poor the food is. But not a problem to bring to my own food. I have found staff in Seattle and Manchester to be helpful and friendly. To change planes in KEF instead of Heathrow or Chicago is a dream. Traveling these days is not easy so one needs tons of patience. When I look at what I saved re price compared to British airways it's is a no brainer. The flights were on time and staff were professional but not overly friendly. overall a good experience I will fly Icelandair on my next trip.

### Icelandair customer review
My 13 year old granddaughter flew unaccompanied aboard an Icelandair flight from Reykjavik to Sanford FL recently and then on a return flight 12 days later. While going through security at the Keflavik terminal one of the Security Agents stopped her and wanted verification that she was allowed to travel alone. Upon her arrival in Sanford FL she was stopped again while the customs officer verified who was meeting her. He then came out to meet my wife and me before allowing my granddaughter to proceed. When checking in for her return flight the airline agent at the Icelandair counter remembered her name and also asked for verification of her status and our relationship. I could not be more impressed and genuinely appreciate the special efforts of all the agents involved. It is very comforting for us and for our granddaughter's family abroad to know that you are taking steps to protect your young travelers.

### Icelandair customer review
Round-trip Seattle to Keflavík in Saga Class in March 2015. Icelandair is behind the times on their premium seats. The in-flight service is is efficient. Icelandair still does not tend to the needs of vegetarians or those who may not eat red meat. The ground staff in Seattle was outstanding. The ground staff at Keflavík was third-rate. At the Saga Lounge when I asked if there were vegetarian options there was utter indifference to my query. As a paying Saga Class customer I was dismayed by this attitude. The boarding area at Keflavík was chaotic - no orderly queues nor status updates. And there was no priority boarding announced for Saga Class passengers. All in all Icelandair really needs to up its game.

### Icelandair customer review
My 4th time transatlantic on Icelandair from Glasgow to Seattle. No complaints. The security process is nothing to do with Icelandair everything to do with EU. Great seats in economy - plenty of room. Food - I eat little while on a journey so not an issue with me so long as there is plenty of water for free. I much prefer Icelandair to any other transatlantic carrier. Baggage allowance is great!

### Icelandair customer review
I think that some of the reviews here are a little unfair in that the airline doesn't pretend to be anything other than budget. We booked an economy flight and were quite happy with the seats and the service we experienced. As for food not being included in the price we were aware of this when we booked the flight and decided not to pay the extra preferring to pay a few quid in Heathrow for a pack of sandwiches a bag of crisps and some biscuits we both eat little when travelling. Bottles of water were given to us on boarding and drinks were served several times during the flight. There was a delay outbound in Iceland amounting to no more than 45 minutes and one inbound to UK again in Iceland but this was due to problems with weather at Heathrow. We did have to undergo a second round of security checks in Iceland returning to UK but they were hardly a problem and certainly can't be blamed on the airline! We do agree with the reviews concerning the cost of snacks and drinks in Iceland. We intend to use Icelandair again possibly upgrading but don't consider that a priority. To sum up we consider we got what we paid for possibly more. It's a budget airline folks. It's not one of the "quality" airlines (and doesn't claim to be) but gets you there in reasonable comfort with reasonable levels of service and at reasonable prices. We don't expect more!

### Icelandair customer review
Flight was delayed several hours but as they have no ground support staff in Denver it was impossible to get any information on why there was a delay or if any rebooking information was available for those with connections they would miss. Even my travel agent could not assist as Icelandair did not enter the delay information into agency databases so even 1 hour after scheduled departure time the flight still showed as "on time". It finally left about 4 hours late. Eventually an agent did show up at the gate 15 mins prior to the original scheduled departure but she made it clear to us that she could not help us very much as she was not an employee of Icelandair and she had very limited system access. She gave me 2 options: 1) "take a chance" and fly to KEF "if/ when" the flight took off. I would miss my scheduled connection but as no other connecting flights were available I could get a hotel in KEF and wait until they found a seat for me to Paris. No information on this flight to Paris would be available until I landed in KEF. 2) Come back the following day for a different flight: I would be booked at a lower class of service but "might" get a refund. Again I would fly to KEF but the connecting flight to Paris was showing as oversold to again I could get a hotel and wait to see what flight opened up. I gave up called my travel agent she cancelled the whole thing demanding a full refund from Icelandair as they did not live up to the expected terms of service and I lost out on a week in Paris.

### Icelandair customer review
Recently flew Birmingham to Keflavik return. Prior to the outbound flight I checked in online and moved our seats to 10a and 10b both of which are in the Economy Comfort area and offer a little more legroom than standard Economy. There was one drinks run and one duty free run. The selection of films was adequate for a 2.5 hour flight. The return flight was onboard the specially liveried Hekla Aurora which was nice as it was due to do the run to Gatwick that day. I again had checked in online and obtained exactly the same seats so the return flight was just as comfortable. I enjoyed using Icelandair and certainly would again if I was flying to north America from BHX rather than travelling down to London. One tip though is that if you are checking in online definitely get yourselves into the Economy Comfort zone and in particularly rows 8 if you are travelling as a couple or row 7 which is just behind Saga class and is very quiet.

### Icelandair customer review
We went to Iceland in January this year holiday was fantastic! Icelandair on the other hand awful company with no customer service. 50 passengers turned up at the airport who weren't told their flights had been cancelled. No communication from Icelandair at all. This turned into a 7 hour delay and a flight with WOW airlines instead. After returning to England I was offered no compensation at all and no reasonable excuse as to why they didn't contact us to tell us our flights were cancelled. Completely unacceptable considering how far people travel and the money they spend to travel to airports for their holidays. I would never travel with Icelandair again and would encourage anybody to think twice about flying with them. They treat their customers like dirt and think they can get away with it. You have been warned!

Great overall times I was in Manchester UK 10hrs after leaving Edmonton with only 90 min stopover in Keflavik. The competition's times exceeded 20hrs. My only concern was that on the return flight #2 we sat on the plane for 85mins at Keflavik waiting to fly to Edmonton. There were five flights leaving at 5pm and all needed to be de-iced and of course we were the last to get the treatment. However good news we were only 15 mins late arriving in Edmonton.

11/02/2015 FI455. 14/02/2015 FI450. I was very impressed with this airline for the two short flights we took. The seats were comfortable the inflight was very good older films but a really good variety. The soft drinks were free but you had to pay for food. This was fine for a shorter flight. We were upgraded to exit row seats on the return leg and these seats were great with lots of room. Staff were friendly and efficient.

### Icelandair customer review
Flew Icelandair over the Christmas holidays from Toronto to Glasgow and back. The outgoing flight from Toronto to Keflavik was delayed over two hours with announcements made over the PA system. This is an overnight flight which is scheduled to leave Pearson at 8.10 pm. The flight was full and ground staff did nothing to alleviate passenger comfort by allowing people to board on a first come first serve basis. I think this is due to the fact that Icelandair doesn't have ground staff and depends on charter airlines to provide staff. I tried to upgrade our tickets at the check-in but was told that this wasn't possible as upgrades needed to be done via telephone 24 hours prior to the flight. I was told the opposite by the Icelandair call centre which is why I thought upgrading at the airport was possible. After a long boarding period we boarded the Boeing 757 which is a small narrow aircraft and found our seats. The seats themselves were very narrow with little to no leg space and minimal recline. Because the flight was packed all the overhead bins were taken by the time we reached our seats which at the back of the plane. Somehow we managed to put our bags and jackets into the bins. Onboard service began with soft drinks. Staff were pleasant but the service itself was quite slow. This is a full service airline on one of its major transatlantic routes and they don't serve you anything but soft drinks and water! Felt like I was travelling on a US airline between Canada and the US. Even Air Canada seemed to have more to offer than Icelandair which is saying a lot. Upon arrival in Keflavik we experienced long lines too. Even though we were transiting through Keflavik en route to Glasgow we had to go through immigration and customs. Food at Keflavik is also minimal and the cold sandwiches and wraps were horribly expensive - $13 US for a cold chicken chipotle wrap - with beer costing $12 US! Flight to Glasgow was also delayed but it was only 2 hours long so much more bearable. Our return journey wasn't much better although I decided to sample the snack box and wine. Very measly portion of mezze and cheap wine for $15 US. Staff was again pleasant but have absolutely nothing to work with especially on the 5.5 hour flight across the Atlantic. All in all a very basic airline with cramped seats minimal service on board poor ground service and poor equipment. Don't think I will travel Icelandair again.

### Icelandair customer review
MAN-KEF-YYZ-KEF-LHR. All flights on time or early. Really no different from any other airline in economy class except that food is paid for at fairly reasonable prices. The IFE is a bit basic but I didn't mind that at all for reasonably short flights. Altogether I found this a good choice for crossing the Atlantic. The transfer in Reykjavik was easy and quite a welcome break. The price was excellent too.

### Icelandair customer review
Flew Seattle to Paris with the stop over in Reykjavik. The staff were friendly and helpful with pillows and blankets before take off. The pillows helped a little with the small uncomfortable seats. By the time we finished the flight I could not feel my backside. My main disappointment was on the return flight our luggage was not loaded on the plane in Paris and it took 5 more days to get it delivered. Beware of the known and infamous weather changes in Iceland. We sat on the Tarmac for 2 hours waiting to taxi the plane behind a large building so we could be bussed off the plane to the terminal where we waited another two hours for our connector flight to the U.S. When we landed in Seattle we were told about the missing luggage that was intentionally left in Paris.

### Icelandair customer review
Seattle-Reykjavik and Reykjavik-London. Was expecting a lot better. No wonder they were dropped as an airline from the star alliance. I experienced long delays on both flights and am stunned that an airline can charge for food when the flight is over 1 hour. I will not fly with Icelandair again!

### Icelandair customer review
CPH-YEG. Second spin long haul with Icelandair and I'm still happy with my choice. First leg was turbulent in the beginning but we were pre-warned by the pilot. Stewardess's were extremely friendly/helpful. Both legs were full/ had plenty of babies and demanding patrons (constantly pressing call buttons even during meal service) but they took it in stride and always came straight away with a smile. Yes if you want a meal you have to pay extra but they've always made that quite clear when you buy your tickets which re price I find extremely competitive for long distance international so I've never had an issue with that. They also take cash on-board (this flight Euro or Krone) which I've never experienced on a international or domestic flight before. Economy has a bit more leg room but this is achieved by shortening the seat length which can be a challenge in that it could make your lower half go numb. to be fair it's economy you'll never be comfortable in this section unless your a child. IES is a bit light on selection compared to other long distance haulers but most people bring a tablet or laptop anyway.

### Icelandair customer review
Overall satisfied with icelandair but writing this review as a heads up to other travelers. When our flight departed Seattle on Dec 30 I did not check in online and we received our picked seats without problems. This was our 40th anniversary trip. On the return flight we arrived at a nearly empty airport 3 hours before our departure and checked in. We were now seated in middle seats separated in the back of the plane. The flight was full and no way were they changing our seat. So moral of the story be sure to check in online 24 hours prior to departure. It seems like all flights depart from Iceland between 1630 and 1730 so it makes for a very hectic airport with few places to sit and wait. I also recommend bringing your lunch on board if it is a long flight.

### Icelandair customer review
Economy class with Icelandair is exactly the same as every other flight (nothing special) except that you have to pay for food. I've never experienced this on a flight before so when my husband and I landed in Iceland we made a dash for food-we were starving. The lack of complimentary food is acceptable for a short flight but we flew from Germany to Iceland and Iceland to Washington D.C.-neither of which were short. Now that I know I will not be flying to Europe with Icelandair again.

FI644 KIAD-KEF 12/21/14. FI645 KEF-KIAD 12/30/14. I notice that this airline is quite friendly once you board the aircraft you could see holiday decorations. They give you Icelandic pure water and it could be great if they could offer a meal during the flight. Seats are not comfortable if you are tall.

Easy to book on the internet. Lovely cabin with leather seats and lots of room (because we were seated next to an exit). As much coffee as you wanted and paid snack service. Excellent Inflight Entertainment. Cabin crew a bit frosty at the beginning but after a while hearty and friendly!

### Icelandair customer review
BOS-KEF-FRA on December 21-23 with an overnight stay in Keflavik. I would recommend Icelandair in particular to those who wish to break the long transatlantic trip with a stopover between the two continents. I traveled in Economy which I found to have sufficient legroom and to be reasonably comfortable especially for the relatively short flights. On both segments the service was polite and helpful though also reduced: the crew came through with beverages and food for purchase just once during each flight. The entertainment system appeared to be state- of-the-art. A nice touch was the fact that the cabins were adorned with some tasteful holiday decorations. I would describe Icelandair as an international equivalent of Southwest: one gets a basic but honest service. Two checked pieces of luggage are included in the ticket price so that passengers don't have to scramble for space in the overhead bins. I allowed myself the luxury of an overnight stay at the Icelandair Hotel in Keflavik. This added to the price of the trip to be sure but I arrived relatively rested and without jet-lag. Overall not at all a bad experience.

Planes delayed all the way through from Edmonton to London. Airport staff in Iceland next to useless. Counter staff and security cleared off and left passengers in limbo as far as getting on to an onward flight. Arriving passengers lined up outside terminal as confusion reigned inside. Finally arrived in London 10 hours late. Will never use this airline again.

ZRH-KEF and KEF-LHR B757. First time flying Icelandair. Fantastic inflight entertainment - big screens and comfortable chairs. The staff were friendly but not over the top. The cabin was comfortable and there was a great easy-going atmosphere on board. Great selection of food too - and a brilliant brilliant safety video. One of the best I've seen. Would recommend highly!

### Icelandair customer review
I wish I had read the fine print about onboard meals before I booked with Icelandair. I was stunned that on a long international flight passengers had to pay for snacks and meals. Given the high ticket prices I just assumed that meals were included in the cost but all we received for free was water and juice. I made sure to pack my own food on the way back home as I did not relish the thought of paying outrageous sums of money for mediocre dishes. I will not fly Icelandair again at least not on a long haul flight.

MAN-JFK-BOS-MAN. A round trip including with my wifea stopover in Reykjavik. Every leg on time with informative excellent FAs. Great food and beverages only slight drawback is seat recline. Lounges in REY BOS superb but MAN (Aspire Lounge) very poor. Check in at MAN REY helpful and painless but BOS less so. Overall a pleasant experience and I shall use/recommend Icelandair again.

LHR to KEF on 17 October 2013 returning on 21 October 2013. Flights FI 451 and FI 454. I'm amazed at the number of people who use Icelandair and complain that there's no food on a 3 hour flight! Can you really not get through a morning or afternoon without stuffing your face? We have traveled with Icelandair about thirty-times in the last fifteen years with our next trip at New Year 2015 and always found customer service both on the ground and in the air to be excellent.

### Icelandair customer review
This was the first time flying with this airline. I am glad that I took the chance the flight transfer time was good and comfortable. Infight entertainment was great but the food or lack of was disappointing and expensive for the limited choice that was there. If I had known I would have bought food to take with me. Tip to passengers: bring your own food. Another thing was that I wish I flew back to Heathrow instead of Gatwick but that was my own fault. I was very happy that I was able to take two pieces of luggage as well as hand luggage which was a bonus. I would definitely travel with Icelandair again.

My flight from Washington to Reykjavik was cancelled and rescheduled 24 hours later. This resulted in my missing the sailing of my cruise ship to its next port. I incurred over $400 in out of pocket expenses to catch up with my ship at its next port. Moreover I purchased Saga Class tickets (business class). The seats were wide with plenty of leg room but did not recline very far. Our evening meal consisted of a sandwich our breakfast was a cup of coffee and a granola bar. The inflight entertainment system was inoperable. Service was fine with lots of apologies but never again will I fly Icelandair.

JFK-KEF-LHR in Economy Class. Check in at the Terminal 7 was fast and the staff are friendly and not to mention that I'm able to check in two pieces of luggage for free is really a plus for this airline. Boarding process was done from back of the aircraft to the front with priority given to the disabled persons and those who travel with minors. It was surprising that the boarding process was rather quick and we're greeted by the flight attendant upon boarding and served with free Icelandic Glacier water. The seat pitch is fine and the B757 modern and simple cabin design is really a welcoming experience. As expected the flight departs on time and meal service starts about 30 minutes after departure although you have to pay for the meals. IFE on board is one of the best I've experienced. The high screen resolution really makes viewing the entertainment offering a fun experience although the choices are rather limited and the best part is no headphone adapter required. Since pillow and blanket are provided it makes the flight feels even more comfortable. Arrival at KEF was easy and quick but due to the fact that the flight arrives at midnight most of the shops are closed. After two nights transit at Iceland I continued my journey to London-Heathrow. Self check-in and security at Keflavik International Airport was quick and since it's afternoon flight all shops are open thus making waiting for the flight much more convenient. During boarding process I was surprised that instead of boarding through gates we're shuttled to the aircraft instead. The aircraft that was operated on this route are probably the last B757 that they haven't refurbished. The cabin shows its age and no IFE available although iPad was distributed after takeoff. The seat are rather less comfortable compared to the previous flight but it's acceptable for a short 2 hours flight. Arrival at LHR Terminal 1 was on time and the luggage arrive at the carousel before I was there due to quite a long time spent at the immigrations thus no "luggage-waiting-game" needed. (which is a plus). Overall the journey on board Icelandair is definitely worth it and the airfare is one of the best among all the carrier operating on the transatlantic route. I will definitely fly with them again.

### Icelandair customer review
Short staff in Denver required long wait to check bags. Ditto at CDG Paris on return flight. Economy seats are cramped and uncomfortable - my wife and I both suffered from leg cramps for a couple of days after each flight because of this. We were surprised to have to pay for food on a 7+ hour flight and the food-value for the price was poor. On the return flight from Iceland to Denver neither my wife's or my movie screen worked despite being re-set twice by staff. Staff offered to re-seat us at working screens but could not seat us together as we had booked and didn't make any effort to re-seat another party to accommodate us. In addition staff allowed several passengers to congregate in the aisle drinking and talking disrupting surrounding passengers. My past flights to Europe have been via American Airlines and Air France both of which provided a greatly superior experience to Icelandair. These tickets were booked by Viking River Cruises as part of a package. If I book with Viking again I will specify no Icelandair.

### Icelandair customer review
London-Reyjavik-Boston-Reyjavik-London. Economy class they were excellent throughout plenty of leg room and I'm 6'1". Staff were pleasant and all flights left on time no delays. No complimentary food on USA flights but I knew that before I booked. Was disappointed with the selection of food available to purchase. Would definitely fly with them again.

### Icelandair customer review
My wife and I flew Saga Class London Heathrow via REF to JFK New York and returned From Newark Liberty. All four flights were on time and the general standard of service was good Saga class on the plane is not what you expect from the main players for business class. However you get all the usual pluses with check in security clearances and lounges etc. Overall value for money.

### Icelandair customer review
After reading a few negative reviews about this airline I was quite concerned about travelling with them. I found the staff pleasant and I had enough legroom short stopover at Reykjavik gave me time to stretch my legs and go to toilet which were immaculate. Only complaint is that they take credit cards instead of money.

### Icelandair customer review
Manchester - Keflavik - Boston and return. All four legs were very comfortable Wi-Fi available approx 50 films plus other inflight entertainment. Lounge at Keflavik very good and Virgin Lounge at Boston excellent. All around very comfortable journey.

### Icelandair customer review
Round-trip from SEA-KEF-SEA in Saga Class. A pleasant experience overall. The Saga Class seats are behind the times and it is time for Icelandair to upgrade them to a fully flat-bed configuration. The inflight service could do with some improvement especially in the training of flight attendants. When I asked for a vegetarian option not only was one not available the flight attendants did not make any attempt to find alternative options or show the least bit of concern. WiFi was available on the SEA-KEF flight but on the KEF-SEA flight it was inoperative. These hiccups notwithstanding I recommend Icelandair for its overall product.

### Icelandair customer review
My wife and I travelled from CPH to EWR via KEF. We were very pleased with seating and service. What surprised us was the quality and taste of the meals served.

### Icelandair customer review
FRA-KEF-SEA (July 16th) (FI521/FI681) DEN-KEF-FRA (Aug 6th/7th) (FI670/520). We had a holiday flight from Germany to the US this summer. We booked very early and Icelandair took the money very early. The good news is you can bring along two pieces of checked-in luggage each. We knew we had to pay for headphones and food which is ok. Airlines in general should imagine how it smells when four of your neighbors eat their garlic sandwiches and goat cheese salads. Seats were medium convenient. It is nice getting a small bottle of water when entering the plane. During the flight free water was served. The noise within those older 757-200 is inconvenient. Preparing for the flight home someone had changed our seats and set us apart. We called Icelandair and got our seats switched. (Our original seats were empty when we got on board.) Because of a thunderstorm we were late in KEF which is ok. But it is not ok to not say a word that the luggage was not on board we waited in FRA for one hour in vain. I am not flying Icelandair anymore.

### Icelandair customer review
Flew from US to Reykjavik and back on Icelandair. Service was minimal. The airline charges for food and drinks (except for water tea and coffee). The crew was very laid back to the point of ignoring safety. The captain did not announce requesting passengers to put on the safety belts on several occasions when the plane went through turbulence and did not announce take off or landing on one leg. The stewardess did not check safety belts on take off and landing. There was only a single service of food even for purchase.

### Icelandair customer review
Great airline very impressed. Was my first time and I will continue doing so. My wife and I did Newark-Amsterdam via Reykjavik and Brussels-NY via Reykjavik. Couldn't asked for a better outcome. All flights were on time very professional crews great airplanes it was flawless. Yes you need to bring your own food (who likes airline food anyways) or you can buy what's available on their menu. My advice walk with your own food. I am 6'3 and had ample leg room very rare to find in today with airlines cutting back on mandatory necessities. All in all great experience and a good layover too in Reykjavik! People are friendly very unique experience and very good deals since it's all tax free. Fly Icelandair they deserve the business.

### Icelandair customer review
Toronto to Heathrow 12/09/14. Undoubtedly the worst flight experience I have had in more than 20 years of transatlantic flying. Rude and obnoxious ground staff. Flight crew only slightly better. The product itself is lamentable. I flew premium economy which was a joke. Please take my advice and do not fly with this airline. I will give a full review in due course.

### Icelandair customer review
MSP-KEF-FRA July 6th 2014. My husband and I and our two dogs were relocating to the Czech Republic Icelandair was the least expensive carrier for us to fly one way with our dogs in the hold. In MSP you check in with SunCountry - they were pleasant and helpful with the dogs reassured us that everything would be fine and they would be well cared for. Shortly after we arrived to the gate (about 3 minutes before boarding) we were called to the desk and told that our dogs were doing well and just loaded and ready to go and that we should board the plane. The plane itself was nice new clean and comfortable. Everyone had their own screen with hundreds of programming. We were given 2 bottles of water we brought sandwiches from home. Shortly after they came around with a beverage selection. About 30 minutes before landing in KEF we were given fresh orange juice. The flight in general was uneventful. We arrived to KEF went through passport control 5 open counters and not a soul in line it took all of 30 seconds and was very efficient. Found our gate used the restroom and then there was an announcement for us to go to the counter. We were told our dogs are on the ground and in good spirits. Our flight from KEF to FRA was just as pleasant as the first. We were given 1 bottle of water and shortly after take-off were also given fresh orange juice. There was personal screens for entertainment and once during the flight they went around with their beverage offerings. The flight was also uneventful. We arrived in Frankfurt and went to collect our dogs. They made our experiences very relaxing and reassured us every step of the way. I would definitely recommend them.

### Icelandair customer review
Not a good experience. Flew from Boston to Reykjavik with about one hour to catch my connection to Glasgow to find out on the information board that the flight was 2.5 hours late. At the information desk I was told coldly that this was the case. No excuse no friendly gesture not even a cup of coffee in an airport that only has one coffee machine with endless queues. No comfort on the plane food and coffee have to be paid for. For the small difference in ticket price I shall in future use one of the main airlines where one can expect decent behavior to passengers.

### Icelandair customer review
Airline staff were all nice and flights from Edmonton to Reykjavik went well. Upon landing in the morning passengers from several flights had to clear through security in a room smaller than most public restrooms! Many were stressed because only an hour is scheduled between flights. I ran through the airport and only just made my flight. Unfortunately in Paris mine and another passengers luggage were not otherwise flight. No Icelandair staff exist in France. Everything is subcontracted to the airport. Even though my luggage arrived the next day a Sunday I did not get a text message until the evening. I clearly wrote In French That was leaving for Spain the next morning but no contact was made with my Paris hotel until Monday afternoon.

### Icelandair customer review
I flew from Dulles to Keflavik round-trip recently and thought this was one of the better airlines that I had flown with. They had good legroom comfortable seats the flight staff was very courteous the flight was smooth overall the plane was in good repair with excellent in-flight entertainment including several really newly release films that I'd wanted to see. I was impressed. Also I loved the slogans on their seat backs and they had really nice overnight blankets that were much fluffier than what you usually get on planes. It was a cushy ride which was good since one flight was an overnighter. The only thing that could have been improved would have been more food selection which was very minimal with just a few options although what they did have looked good and they had a great drink selection on board. Of course a larger plane also would have been a plus since it was just three seats on each side. Otherwise I would take Icelandair again from the US to Iceland over another airline any day. I absolutely hate flying and the experience was pretty good actually.

### Icelandair customer review
Flew YEG-KEF-LHR. Standard airline experience no better or worse than most North American airlines. For the price though I'd say it was better. My only complaints are in a 6 hour flight food had to be paid for in economy and leg room in economy was basically non-existent for a taller person like myself. If you're over 6 feet you definitely need an isle seat to get a bit more room. Initial flight was delayed 20-30 minutes but luckily Reykjavik airport is quite small so I was able to make my connection.

### Icelandair customer review
Oslo-Keflavik-Oslo. Upgraded to Saga Class cabin on boarding although travelling Economy Comfort. Service always with a smile and great value for money. Food choice is pretty average.

### Icelandair customer review
LGW-KEF KEF-LHR. I flew from London to Reykjavik with a return flight. On both of my flights there was a delay of at least 30 minutes which annoyed me. The inflight entertainment did not work yet was offered free iPads and headphones which I considered fantastic. On my return flight the inflight entertainment was working and was incredible however I did not like the fact that they were charging you to use headphones. The aircraft's were quite nice comfy and modern. The crew were kind and had a smile on their face. One of the things I did not like was the fact that food was not included in the price of the economy ticket. If you flew economy you were not allowed to check in baggage which was unfair given the very pricey tickets. I believe that if food was included on the price and they treated all passengers equally they would be the best airline I have flown with. Nonetheless it was a very good experience and I would not mind using it again.

### Icelandair customer review
JFK to Reykjavik to Stockholm. I never made it to Stockholm and after I was told I would not get there for two more days I decided to return to JFK. Customer service is nearly non-existent. If you don't mind how long it takes to get to your destination (could be days) this airlines may be a good choice. The fleet is quite cramped forget in flight entertainment (3 of 4 seats did not work on last flight) and don't expect to feel you got what you paid for.

### Icelandair customer review
Returned from Iceland to Ireland via London Heathrow last Thursday June 19th on Flight FI454 from KEF at 16.10 At 4.30 informed that the flight was now confirmed to take off at 17.00. No announcement was made no explanations given and no one from Icelandair appeared to answer the passengers questions and concerns. Flight eventually took off at 17.20 and was further delayed at London Heathrow due to a time slot to land. The pilot on welcoming us on board explained that the delay was due to a member of the cabin crew becoming ill and a replacement crew member having to be got. He also apologised for the delay. I was to originally have 2 and a half hours between landing in Heathrow and taking off again on a connecting flight to Ireland. I barely had an hour to get off go through passport control rush to baggage reclaim check in for connecting flight go through customs and get to the boarding gate. As it worked out I just got to the boarding gate in time and this was due to two factors. One was that there was no queue both at the check-in desk and at customs and secondly the cabin crew on flight FI454 allowed me to move from my allotted seat in the 2nd last row to a seat in row 6 near the exit door for the last 20 minutes of the flight and so allowed me to get off quickly. My sincerest thanks to the cabin crew. This was my 5th return trip to Iceland on holidays since 1991 and using Icelandair each time. This particular experience has left me wary of using Icelandair again and of considering using alternative airlines in travelling to Iceland on future trips.

### Icelandair customer review
I will never fly Icelandair again. We were scheduled to depart for Stockholm via Reykjavik on an evening flight on June 16th. When we got to the airport we read on the departures board that our flight had been canceled! We were never told about the cancellation and we had been home all day. In addition I had tried to print my boarding passes the night before our departure and when I couldn't I tried calling the customer service number to try to find out why. I was put on hold for over an hour and finally gave up. It was no better the morning of our departure. I could not reach a customer representative and was once again put on hold. When we returned home on the 23rd we had a voice message on our phone that was sent 3 hours before our departure telling us about the cancellation. Three hours before an international flight is not nearly enough time to tell someone about a cancelled flight. We had already left for the airport when we were called. I will not recommend Icelandair to anyone. The customer service is terrible if not non-existent.

### Icelandair customer review
YEG-MAN. Initial flight was delayed 40 min due to mechanical issues thus boarding was prompt. Seat width and leg room were impressive important point is that all seat arms including aisle and window raised something I wish all carriers would implement. To get more leg room they have shortened the seat depth which can be a problem for those with longer legs (I started to lose the feeling in mine after 4 hours) and the material used (leather) was very uncomfortable. Tons of storage (first full flight I've been on where storing luggage was not an issue) IFE was limited but suited the purpose and crew were helpful and friendly. Customs at KEF was annoying to go through if transferring to another flight but the speed at which they do it testifies to why they have such short connection times. If you have more than an hour connecting you will make your flight if delayed. Do dress in layers. the first flight was blasting cold air the second blasted warm.

### Icelandair customer review
KEF-LGW. The only thing I found odd is when we arrived at the airport from Edmonton landed on time but had to go through security. Flight wise it was fine arrived a few minutes late but what can you expect landing in London? Overall great flight.

### Icelandair customer review
LHR-BOS via KEF 31 May 2014. Plane was delayed and it was comforting that we were told that we would be found a different flight to Boston that night if there was a chance we would not make our connection. The Star Alliance lounge in Terminal 1 was good with excellent catering and plenty of seats. We eventually boarded significantly delayed. Having done the research on Icelandair's website I was aware that Saga Class seating was effectively "US Domestic" 2x2 with limited recline. Definitely not the flat beds you can find on other Airlines. But then again the price you are paying is significantly below these other carriers. IFE was OK if slightly limited. The meals on all flights were disappointing. Two smallish courses is not my idea of Business Class catering even on the 3 hour flight to Reykjavik - however the quality was good. There were 3 courses on the KEF-BOS leg plus a welcome drink and a travel kit. When we eventually reached KEF we were 1 hour 45 minutes late for a 2 hour connection. With 15 minutes to go we were disembarked onto a bus which deposited us close to the next gate and we boarded immediately. Our bags also made the connection which was a relief and impressive. BOS-KEF 9 June 2014. Again efficient check in. The Virgin Atlantic Lounge in BOS was surprisingly poor. A subterranean dungeon it obviously does the minimum amount of catering it feels it can get away with for the Icelandair customers. Flight was very similar to the outbound except we were back down to 2 course small meals and no travel kit. All flight crews did a reasonable job given what they have to work with. KEF-LHR 14 June 2014. Saga Class Check in at KEF is at the furthest point of the terminal. Indeed Keflavik does not recognise premium travellers. I did not find a fast track and the boarding was a chaotic scrum. However the Saga lounge by gate 6 is stylish even if again the catering is limited.

### Icelandair customer review
We were booked to fly London Gatwick to Toronto in May 2014 but the airline had a pilots strike as we were boarding the aircraft. Passengers were taken off and complete confusion reigned made worse by the airline having none of its own staff at Gatwick. We asked to be transferred to another carrier but were told this was not possible. Eventually we were told that they had booked us onto a BA flight from Heathrow the next day and that we would have to make our own arrangements to get from one airport to another and book into a hotel. On returning from Toronto there was no fast track lane for business class and once on board the seat comfort was barely above economy. The seat would not recline to a sleeping position because there was insufficient space between the seat rows. Dinner was excellent but breakfast on the Reykjavik to London leg the next morning was no better than adequate.

### Icelandair customer review
MAN-KEF. Delayed nearly 1hr due to late arrival of incoming plane and then further delay after aircraft pushed back and lost power. Information sparse and difficult to hear Captain's announcements. New plane however and very good IFE made for a quick journey to KEF. Again service attentive and friendly.

### Icelandair customer review
KEF-SEA. Late arrival of plane from MAN made for a few worried passengers with tight connections. Small airport was chaotic and SEA boarding was unannounced and uncontrolled making for a late departure. Gate staff weren't concerned. On board seemed to be an almost standard product on what was my 4th flight with FI in 6 days. However benefited in the new IFE system which is good. Again food good but serving size is small. FA's attentive and friendly again and serviced the cabin frequently. A bit annoying lights were never dimmed and many people left shades open whole journey. Liked the little touches of explaining facts about the country on the food wrappings food service upon request small bottle of water given when boarding and the collection of rubbish in a nicely designed carrier bag to hide the white plastic rubbish bag. Overall a pleasant enough and cost effective way to Europe from the US.

### Icelandair customer review
KEF-MAN. Very efficient transfer in the small airport after flight from SEA. Older plane and no IFE but not a big issue for a 2.5hr flight. Service attentive and friendly.

### Icelandair customer review
SEA-KEF. First time to use this airline to reach UK. Offered much cheaper fare than BA and overall much better value. Offered exit row at gate and with no one next to me which effectively matched FI prem econ (which looks poor value). FA's attentive and friendly. Food for purchase - I ordered chicken curry which was very tasty but a little small. Seats as some reviewers have mentioned are hard but not too uncomfortable. Good quality blanket offered. IFE was one of the older versions and a bit limited but acceptable. Overall good value and an efficient way back to UK albeit a bit more of a red-eye than comparable route with BA.

### Icelandair customer review
LGW-KEF and KEF-LHR Saga Class. Shared lounge at LGW nothing special much better at KEF on return. Help-yourself bar and food and plenty of facilities. Smart and clean 757 plenty of space for short haul though flight route map not working outbound. Food pretty good and very generous indeed with drink. Excellent service from polite and smart female crew on both flights. 30 mins late from LGW - captain said it was awaiting tow from tug rather than anything Icelandair had control over. Bang on time on the return. Bag drop off at KEF very confusing and sour young member of staff at desk clueless and unhelpful. Overall impression - slick smart and friendly.

### Icelandair customer review
Flight 471 from Gatwick to KEF on May 30 and Flight 635 from KEF to BOS on Monday 6/2. My last time on Icelandair. No service at all not even water. For a 5 hour flight passengers are expected to purchase their own food. The food selection is dismal very disappointing. I have flown other airlines in the same price range and had a meal and a drink/ Its absurd for an airline on such long legs to not provide complementary meals/drink. This is my last time of ever using that airline. I will rather pay a little more for some comfort. The annoying thing is that there is no disclosure to passengers about getting your own food.

### Icelandair customer review
Glasgow to Keflavik and Keflavik to Stockholm both flights right on schedule. Clean comfortable aircraft (B 757) and friendly helpful staff. Both flights were also very well priced. Their food for purchase was good and reasonably priced (by Nordic standards!). Great airline and a fine introduction or farewell to a very beautiful country. Well done Icelandair.

### Icelandair customer review
Just got back from Europe. My son and I had booked Icelandair Seattle-KEF-Munich and then return was Paris-KEF- SEA. (And my daughter was travelling on a slightly different itinerary out of Indiana through KEF). We got caught up in the strike in May so ended up on Lufthansa into Munich which was great. The rebooking was smooth as could be with my choice of Delta or Lufthansa arriving at about the same time as the Icelandair flight would have arrived. Weird that I was notified of the cancellation via email though. My daughter who was supposed to meet us at KEF (coming Delta from South Bend to Minneapolis then Icelandair) had no cancelled flights but still ended up coming into Munich several hours late due to airline delays. On the day of our return flights out of Charles De Gaulle we arrived at the airport at 10.45 for a 2.10pm flight. Imagine our surprise to see 100 people already in line ahead of us at the ticket counter! The ticket agents didn't show up until at least 11.30 and then spent another 15 minutes piddling around until they finally starting checking people in. We finally got our luggage checked and boarding passes at 1:00pm. Two hours standing in line just to check in! Since we had expected to have ample time to check in and then find somewhere to sit and eat at the airport we had arrived with empty stomachs were not happy at waiting so long in line especially knowing the food situation on the Icelandair flight itself. Boarding was basically Saga then Economy Comfort then free for all. At KEF they were boarding SEA right next to a Boston flight so the gate was very crowded with everyone standing in line. That said our actual flight was fine. We had pillows on the second leg of the trip and the flights attendants were very nice on both legs. Our KEF-SEA flight had many middle seats open and our in-flight entertainment systems worked fine although selections were somewhat limited. No problem for us as we had brought Kindles and iPads. By the way my daughter's flight out of KEF was delayed 30 minutes which meant she missed her Delta connection in Minneapolis to her final destination of South Bend Indiana and which forced her to wait for the next flight out at 1pm the next day.

### Icelandair customer review
Travelled on Icelandair from Seattle to Glasgow (never made it) on May 19 for our honeymoon in UK. Flight delayed in Seattle for 3 hours due to pilot's labour dispute and refusing to leave on time. Missed connecting flight in Reykjavik they tried to put us onto a flight the next day. We had to fight to get onto the next flight to London later that afternoon. Many passengers had to stay in Iceland over night. By missing our connection we also missed our pre booked train in Glasgow. The only reason we even made it to UK that same day was by looking up flights online ourselves and showing the staff in Iceland what flight they were putting us on. If you leave it to them you will never make it.

### Icelandair customer review
First time using Icelandair and probably the last. Despite booking in January and choosing my seat in Comfort Class they were changed 5 times before I even traveled. I e-mailed a complaint to which I did have a reply. Flight to Reykjavik was okay minimal service and a very poor selection of food. Delay connecting with the London leg due to the go slow. 2 hours late for a 2.5 hour flight.! and they changed my seat. Terrible boarding procedure no announcements and no jetway so we had to walk up the steps which slowed everything even more. On the return leg via Reykjavik the Seattle flight was on the board as leaving on time although boarding did not commence until the take off time. Again no announcements and walking up the steps again. Plus they tried to change my seat and this time I refused. One pass of the drink and food cart for a 7.5 hour flight. They are really not service oriented. Why is there no jetway available for the Seattle in and out bound flight? and why are 3 US bound flights leaving at the same time from adjacent gates causing absolute chaos in a small waiting area?

### Icelandair customer review
Booked for us through Viking. Economy is what I would call 4th class. I guess it was cheap and that is why it could be included with the cruise package. I think I would have opted to pay a little more for a different airline. Long trip with no food service and my one leg in the middle seat was very uncomfortable. I was very happy the pilots were on strike and we were changed to a direct flight on Air France with 2 meals free choice of beverage including champagne. Much more comfortable seat etc.

### Icelandair customer review
Flew Icelandair for the first time in May 2014. For the lower price and free stopover I really think it was fine despite a flight cancellation. Flight from Boston to Keflavik for 2-day stopover was smooth and pleasant. No complaints friendly service. 2 days later our flight from Keflavik to Amsterdam was cancelled due to strike. We found out the night before thankfully since we decided to check our emails on our phones at dinner via the restaurant wifi and the airline had sent us an e-mail about the cancellation. After the hassle of having to extend our hotel and rental car in Iceland I waited on the phone on hold to speak with an Icelandair agent for about 30 minutes. When I finally got someone on the line she was very helpful quick and efficient and gave us 2 options for the next available flights (one the next day but not direct and one 2 days later and direct). She booked us for the one we chose and we were emailed the confirmation right away. No delay s or cancellations on our flights home from Amsterdam through Keflavik and Toronto to Pittsburgh. It was a pain in the butt having to rearrange 2 days our our first ever European vacation and not knowing the results of reimbursement request yet. They said it could take up to 30 days to hear back about reimbursement. Apparently Icelandair will reimburse hotel and up to 25 Euros per day for food. Meanwhile it's very expensive to eat in Iceland if you want to eat something other than junk food - 25 Euros is not enough for one day of food in my opinion. Iceland was a lovely place to visit and the only real complaint I have about the actual flights is that it was a little warm on the longer flight home which made it feel like it was even longer.

### Icelandair customer review
My husband and I had reservations to travel to the UK on 10 May. When we arrived at the Icelandair check-in booth about three hours in advance of the flight we were told that the flight had been cancelled because of the Icelandair pilot's strike. The staff made no effort to call us and tell us this. They told us (nothing in writing) that we had seats on a BA flight leaving the next day at 1030 at night. This turned out not to be true and we ended up flying to London via BA in "stand by coach" mode instead of the business class seats we had paid for. The whole process repeated when it was time to leave - when we arrived at Heathrow on 19 May the Icelandair folks told us the flight had been delayed. By an hour. Then again. Finally it was obvious that the flight was not going to happen so they put a group of us (about 30) on a BA flight for the trip home about 5 hours after the schedule flight. No one told us why the flight had been cancelled so I can only presume that it was another strike. After the crew behind the Icelandair counter told us they were putting us on another airline they gathered us up and said they would take us to where we could reclaim our checked bags. As the lead Icelandair agent led us through the airport we were delayed by the passport reader for about 30 seconds and when we reached the othe side she had disappeared with about 5 of the people she was leading. We never saw her or caught up to her again and neither did the passengers behind us in the line. We were entirely on our own negotiating the UK border lines and finding the correct baggage carousol not to mention trying to find "Terminal 5" that can only be reached by train. At no point during this whole evolution did any Icelandair employee in the airports offer apologies or try to give us more than the most minimal assistance. They did not waste any effort smiling at us or trying to help out. They treated us like we were nothing more than a tremendous annoyance to them. I will never fly Icelandair again.

Our flight from Dulles to Iceland was canceled last night after we waited all day. We may even miss our cruise out of Copenhagen because of the cancellation. We suspect the cancellation was not the result of mechanical problem as was asserted by airline officials but rather an unofficial slow down strike. It appeared they were following the company line when they lied to us about it. Reluctantly we can understand and forgive the stupidity that would allow a strike which of course hurts the economy of Iceland and causes people like me to say never again and consequently in the end hurts the airline and its personnel. But what we don't forgive is the lying to the passengers telling us that this was a mechanical problem. They lie to us and then want us to trust our lives to them. If the airlines would lie to us about that then they would lie to us about anything. As far as I am concerned it is now a moral issue rather than just a socio economic labor dispute.

We were going to Amsterdam from Edmonton. This was our first trip to Europe. The staff in Edmonton were friendly and given 1 bottle of water for walking on the plane was nice but that is about as far as service went. For an international flight we thought we would get better service and maybe a bag of nuts or snacks but only water or pop. The seats were very tight for legroom and as the comfort of the seats well they were not. Landed in Iceland and we had to go through security. Our connecting flight was at 7:20 and we arrived at 6:45 with approximately 200 passengers 3 security people no one on the flight believed we would make the plane but we did make it with about 5 minutes to spare. Flight to Amsterdam much better. returning from Amsterdam to Iceland good flight flying back to Edmonton delayed for no reason as the pilots were not on strike that day. The terminal was full of passengers going to different locals but there were no announcements about any delays they started to put people through but then stopped for no reason they put more people through and then we had to wait for the bus to take us to the plane. 2 hour delay sitting in a tiny airport with nothing to do. This is a joke and next trip to Europe I will spend more just for the comfort factor. You get what you pay for - thank you travel agent.

### Icelandair customer review
Flights out from Denver to KEF and then to Glasgow was okay because we were excited to be on our way. No leg room hard seats no food only beverages served twice on a 7 hr. flight. The good thing was they got us to our destination and we enjoyed our time in Scotland - until 16th May. Supposed to return on 16th May - checked on line before leaving hotel and flight was on time. At the Glasgow airport stood in line for an hour to be told no flights leaving until 10.5 hours later so we would miss our connection. Sent us to another (Menzies) window where we stood in line again for about an hour. They finally got us booked on United for our return but said that Icelandair may reimburse us for motel and meals because of the delay. No vouchers or "made ahead" reservations for us. Very disappointing.

### Icelandair customer review
Have had issues with two previous flights on Icelandair but continued to book with them as their sales are generally good. Have finally decided however that you get what you pay for. I will never fly this miserable airline again. Major delays when flying to Europe due to their strike. This is unacceptable. They had plenty of advance warning and could easily have planned ahead. (And I was flying on a "non strike" day.) When British Airways went on strike several years ago management actually worked as flight attendants to prevent interruption to their service. That is customer service and Icelandair should pay attention. No one at the Icelandair customer service kiosks (in any airport) seems to know what's up. Relatives attempting to monitor flights cannot get necessary information online due to poor computer software services. Poor seating onboard. Miserable food service. The only thing of value is their inflight entertainment service. In the future I will fly another airline regardless of where I am going even if the cost is double.

### Icelandair customer review
Worst economy seating I've sat in for a transatlantic flight. I wanted to upgrade my seating for the return trip for me and my husband - I was staggered when the agent told me it would require re-writing the ticket and thus incur a $250 change fee plus $35 admin fee plus the change in seat price. This was not a date change - just a seat upgrade - almost $1000 for a seat change! Icelandair just lost two customers on their first trip with them.

### Icelandair customer review
May 6 LGW-KEF-JFK Economy Class. An excellent flight on all sectors warm welcoming flight crews. My Husband required wheelchair assistance. This was achieved with smiles grace and compassion. The lack of "free food" did not worry me as a Diabetic as many so called "Diabetic Meals" provided free by other carriers have been the exact opposite almost bordering on being toxic. Purchased delicious sandwiches at LGW for both sectors and had a high quality delightful picnic. Legroom good in all sectors and the toilets maintained spotlessly clean at all times.

### Icelandair customer review
Icelandair compares with the worse of the US based airlines who are generally recognised as providing the worse inflight serve of all the international airlines. I flew in both Economy and Saga Class. The Economy Cabin has the lowest seat spacing I have ever encountered. Seven hour flights with only a small bottle of water provided. Meals in Saga (Business Class) not as good as the basic meal served in economy class by most international airlines e.g. BA KLM Air France Emirates etc. Cabin crew are at best indifferent and at worse rude.

### Icelandair customer review
Our first and last booking on Icelandair. We booked from Edmonton to Amsterdam April 25. We checked updates 10 minutes before arriving at airport flight late notice only upon arrival at airport. Return Flight was cancelled from Amsterdam. 90% of passengers were notified by e-mail not us! So diversion of 9 hours. Not impressed at all. We travel 4-5 times a year. Not worth the deal on price.

### Icelandair customer review
Flight from Edmonton was delayed by 2 hours - was informed of this at the check in desk which is fine. Connecting flight out of Keflavik was delayed by an additional 2 hours because we waited for about a third of the plane to board all at once 1.5 hrs after everyone else got on. Pinned the issue on airport strikes and refused to acknowledge poor organization which seems like the likely culprit. Customer service took a very long time to reply to emails and offered no compensation for missed flight out of final destination.

### Icelandair customer review
We flew from London to Iceland and on to Orlando May 2014 in Saga Class with a 3 night stop over in Iceland. I require wheelchair assistance. I was given help on and off the planes with a smile. Both flights were on time. The crews were courteous and helpful on both flights. When I got up to go the toilet a crew member came to offer a pull up from my seat. I agree with other reviews that the seats do not meet current business class standards on international flights but they are reasonably comfortable and offer enough recline to stretch out on a long flight. The free stop over in Iceland was a great bonus. Overall Icelandair offers good value for the price paid.

### Icelandair customer review
We recently flew from Copenhagen to Seattle via Icelandair - an experience I'll never forget or want to repeat. I have cerebral palsy and use a scooter for mobility. While I knew our trip to Europe might pose challenges in older cities and architecture our time in Europe was seamless until we got to Copenhagen airport - the one place I thought would be barrier free. My walker and scooter were taken from me as soon as we checked-in - we were four hours early at the airport and had to use a manual wheelchair provided by Icelandair. We changed planes in Reykjavik where there was no gangway/ramp to plane available - only a huge flight of stairs. When I inquired about how I could get on the plane they said "you will walk up the stairs. I told them how difficult this would be for me particularly in the rain. By the time I got to the top of the stairs an attendant finally offered to give me a hand. Too little too late. Of all the places I anticipated challenges the airports weren't among my major concerns. Very disappointed in Icelandair and how they handled my trip from Copenhagen to Seattle.

### Icelandair customer review
Worst flight ever. YYZ-KEF - Over 5 hours and they wanted 8 Euros for a sandwich. When we boarded the plane it was literally 92 Fahrenheit. The crew were rude and they took 30 minutes to get a coke for you.

Flew Edmonton to Frankfurt via Reykjavik. Flight departed 5 minutes early from Edmonton and was a smooth flight with good inflight service and food. Short layover in Iceland before boarding connection flight to Frankfurt. Return flight had a short delay arriving In Edmonton due to a minor mechanical problem with the aircraft. Overall very satisfied with Icelandair and would not hesitate to use them again!

### Icelandair customer review
We flew from JFK NY to Stockholm Sweden via layover in Iceland. On our way to Sweden the trip was OK. Landings a bit bumpy. On the way back the entertainment system from Stockholm to Reykjavik was not working at all. The second leg of our flight I encountered a similar situation. The seat I was sitting at the touch screen was not working properly. The flight attendant reset it to no avail. It was not working. I was given a blanket to cover the screen because we could not even turn it off! When they crew were passing out the US Customs forms they missed us and we missed them. At some point we asked them for a form for our family and we were rudely told they had passed by twice already. At no point did anyone make an effort to make sure we had the form. They grudgingly brought one over. Overall the service was very poor no food served on the Intl portion of the flight just soft drinks and coffee/tea. I would avoid them in the future if I can help it.

### Icelandair customer review
Flew from Washington DC to Helsinki via Reykjavik in business (Saga) class. I'm not a tall person (5 ft 4) so my feet could not touch the floor from the seat. The so-called footrest was a little metal pad right on the floor so it didn't help either. As the seat upholstery was slippery I could not get any traction for the back from that either so that the entire trip was very uncomfortable. But the worst experience was the luggage delay. OK it happens that the bag sometimes does not arrive and you may have to slum it in your flight clothes for a day. But this time the bag was found quickly but it could not be transported 100 km out of Helsinki in more than 3 days! If I had known this I would have taken a taxi or rented or car and had retrieved the bag myself. I pay their top fare and Icelandair does not seem to think that my luggage deserves decent and prompt handling. Will never fly Icelandair again and will not recommend it.

### Icelandair customer review
Booked an Easter city break with Icelandair. Strange update seat requests by auction offers looked at it but could not justify the extra costs associated with each type especially with not knowing what you get for the upgrade. Think it was more of a money generator for the airline rather than an offer to the passenger. The boarding was a request for the speedy boarders and passengers at the back of the aircraft so would be upset if I had paid extra. In fact I was first on the aircraft. Plane seats and FA were good. Paid for the airport to Hotel transfer which was ok and straightforward. Flights back we checked in online to find we had wasted our time as we had to use a machine behind long queues to print out boarding passes and case tickets. Airport ok food ok transfer through to gate and return flights all good.

I went Saga Class Amsterdam to Newark. The flights left promptly on time and landed with time to spare. I had read reviews about there being no priority boarding at Keflavik but had hoped this wasn't true. It's true. The mob just surged all at once for the plane. Being disabled gave me no priority either. Meals were so so; I have had much better on Economy with Air France. The flight attendants were very friendly. The bottom line is that you get what you pay for cheaper fares mean cheaper overall service.

### Icelandair customer review
SEA-KEF-GLA and return for trip to the UK. Have used British Airways in the past but because Icelandair's price came in at less than half what BA want for Business Class I chose to go with Icelandair. It must be said it is not as comfortable as BA's Club World not by a longshot. But for the price it's not too bad either. Positives include: smaller plane smaller airport (KEF) making it easier to get around; Friendly efficient cabin crew. Really tasty food. Saga Class bulkhead seat has a cutout so you can put a bag at your feet rather than in overhead locker which is convenient. Negatives (or at least not as positive) are: seat isn't as comfortable and doesn't fully recline. And when the person in front of you reclines you get a little locked in (which one hopes to avoid in business class usually) Overall though I'd say it's good value for the money and connecting through KEF is much more convenient than most of Europe's other larger airports. I would fly Icelandair again without hesitation.

### Icelandair customer review
First of all the flight was delayed 26 hours. We were sent to a hotel after 4 hours. Asked to be back 14 hours later. When at hotel to late for food. No dinner. Morning we had breakfast on Airline and lunch dinner on airline at airport. Late 2 hours leaving on the second day. When we arrived in Iceland they let everyone off but only wanted people that were transferring everyone else put on hold like cattle in a corral. After everyone off then they want you to get you through customs immediately (I don't do lineups and waiting). I would never use Icelandair again and I would never visit Iceland again.

Bad start to a short holiday. We decided to take a short holiday in Iceland and we were to leave from Edmonton on March 24 2014. Delayed 26 hours. Now a four day holiday is three days. They did put us up in a hotel but you better have insurance for anything else that you missed. Would not recommend this airline.

### Icelandair customer review
I first flew on Icelandair when I came back to the US from Europe in 1964. At that time the plane was a 4 engine prop DC-6B. It was an adventure! The next time that I flew Icelandair was in 2001 to visit my kids in Sweden going to school. Flew from Minneapolis to Reykjavik to Stockholm. It was a great flight and the service was better than any that I had experienced (I am an extensive traveler in the US on business). Had wonderful hot meals and essentially an open bar. The 757 was immaculate and the service was too. Just got back from Europe this past week and what a difference. No more included food and drink but the service was just OK this time.

### Icelandair customer review
Overnight to Sweden and back March 2014. Changing planes in Iceland makes for a shorter trip to Europe. The seats were very hard. No meals on an overnight flight was a shock. Iceland airport is fairly small so getting through customs and to the connecting flight was easy and quick. With SAS reducing flights Icelandair is a reasonable alternative. But bring your own sandwich and seat cushion.

### Icelandair customer review
JFK-KEF-JFK on February 27 and March 3rd. The first leg was on a 757-200 with narrow seats and bad legroom. In addition the aircraft was unbearably hot. Free movies Wi-Fi and food for purchase. FA's nice and attentive. The flight back to JFK was on a 757-300 and both the seats and the legroom were excellent for economy class. This flight was much more comfortable than the outbound leg.

### Icelandair customer review
It seemed like a good price for Business class YYZ-KEF-BOS. The seats are terribly uncomfortable and scarcely recline which is a huge negative on an overnight transatlantic flight. Couldn't see much of a difference between Saga (which we booked) and Premium Economy. Food service was nothing special and the movie selection was the most limited I've encountered in years. The biggest plus was the Saga club at KEF: nice assortment of fine pastries snacks and beverages and comfortable seating.

### Icelandair customer review
LHR-KEF-LGW first time with Icelandair and the positives outweigh the negatives. On the plus side both flights departed pretty much on schedule and the IFE for what is a relatively short flight is excellent with a great choice of films and a largish display for an economy seat. The crews were also welcoming and polite. The only real down sides are the incredibly uncomfortable seats and the lack of any complimentary refreshments - flying economy on FI means you pay for everything even water just like on a loco.

### Icelandair customer review
Jan 27 - JFK-KEF-LGW. Feb 4 - LGW-KEF-JFK. My first experience with Icelandair. Very impressed. Lovely caring cabin crew. Seating very comfortable nice large fluffy blanket with large pillow and on the US legs a bottle of mineral water. Transfer in KEF effortless both ways. The Pay as you Eat policy for food did not worry me as I always bring my own meal. Experienced a medical emergency half way into the KEF-JFK Flight my blood sugar levels fell dangerously low. The Cabin Crew were very attentive and caring and even radioed ahead for a wheelchair at JFK. Very impressed at the crew's professionalism.

FI 521 FRA-KEF. Extreme crosswinds visual minimum's under 900ft and a very slippy runway (heavy snow) the captain did a great job of landing. During the flight everything was fine. Polite cabin crew good entertainment but I missed a meal on a 3.5hr flight up to Iceland. Please Icelandair change your business philosophy and invest in free meals just like other flagcarriers in Europe do.

### Icelandair customer review
I fly Icelandair to Europe and back two or three times a year mainly because they are always less expensive and I can spend a night or two in Iceland to get rid of jet lag and enjoy Reykjavik. My most recent trip was in Dec. and Jan. DEN-KEF-LON and back. I was upgraded to Saga class. Boarding always seems fast and very efficient compared to other airlines. Food is very good with a selection of both meat and fresh fish. The entertainment is ok with old and new movies and a great selection of music but the touch screen doesn't always work this can be annoying on an 8 hour flight. Changing planes in Iceland can seem hectic as the airport is small and many planes arrive and depart close to the same time but all the gates are no more than 5 minutes from each other. My main complaint about Icelandair is information and upgrades given by central reservations in Iceland are often ignored or changed by ticket or gate agents in other countries.

### Icelandair customer review
We traveled from SEA to KEF in economy Jan 24 returning Jan 27. Had a good experience on both flights. Seats were good for the 7 hr plus flight. Cabin staff were very nice out bound but a little stiff inbound. Would use them again and have recommended them to friends for their plans out of YVR this summer.

We purchased Saga Business Class tickets (First Class) for one stop (Reykjavik Iceland KEF) with arrival at 12pm Munich time Dec 8 2013. However boarding of the flight in DC was delayed due to a "problem with the lavatory" although we were assured at the DC gate that we would make our Munich connection in KEF. This mechanical problem resulted in our plane arriving at KEF only a few minutes within our Munich flight departing KEF. As a result we were re-routed by Icelandair through Copenhagen which resulted in considerable inconvenience including an additional 4-5 hours of travel. My TV/Movie screen did not work on the return flight; the flight was in excess of six hours. We found the comfort and services offered by Icelandair to be quite adequate and would have flown Icelandair again pending satisfactory resolution of this outbound costly inconvenience. We will not fly this airline again.

I have travelled from Halifax Canada to Manchester UK and back twice - the first time (2011) I changed planes (both ways) in Iceland with just a short stopover in the middle of the night. It was a bit chilly and we had to go out onto the tarmac to get to the plane which I was surprised about but everything before that had gone very smoothly. I ate at the airport so I didn't need food for the journey. It is a very nice airport but as others have said there are not many places to sit except at the gates but they have a nice area in the centre with restaurants and shops. The seats in the plane were quite comfortable with plenty of leg room which I needed as I had a knee replacement and my leg does not bend very much anymore. The entertainment worked well - I took my own earphones as you have to buy them (as on most airlines). My only complaint is that last year (2013) I had to either stay over in Iceland for the night or take the plane to Toronto then on to Halifax they had stopped the layover so I stayed in Reykjavik. I hope they go back to the layover again UK to Can but even if they don't I would fly with them again this time via Toronto.

Flew Denver to Zurich. Accepted two stops because the price was good for business class but the seating made it a very bad value for the money. Very little seat back reclining not much space to the seat in front really just about the same as an economy plus seat on United. Also no foot support. The food was great but I don't really care about that - I just want some sleep which was impossible in these seats. The first leg flight was also 3 hours late due to a broken part which necessitated rebooking the successive two flights. Their plane their fault no compensation other than an apology.

IAD-LHR. SAGA class. Checked with Icelandair via e-mail if I could take 3x32 kg per person as other airlines flying this route allow. Got a reply saying I was correct and that I could take 3x32kg per person. I have just checked in with Icelandair at Dulles airport and told that unless I paid $262 for two bags they would not check us in. They insist that my allowance is only 2x32kg per person. I showed them my e-mail which clearly states that I was allowed 3 bags only to be told that the Icelandair representative had made a mistake. I am now in the Air France lounge shared with Icelandair. There is nowhere to sit with minimal refreshments. How they can call this a business lounge I don't know. The whole idea as others have said in flying Business Class. Is that it should be stress free. I wish that was the case. I am now dreading the flight itself.

### Icelandair customer review
Terrible experience from start to finish. We were delayed travelling to Iceland from New York by weather which is perfectly fine and expected due to the awful conditions but the service at Reykjavik airport was nothing short of shambolic. We missed our connecting flight because of the delay again which is fine and were put on a later flight to London then onto our final destination of Glasgow. They couldn't give us our baggage number at the service desk and were told we'd get it at the gate by staff there. Eventually got to the gate later that day only to be treated with no care whatsoever. Staff were rude unwilling to give us the baggage number and told us 4 different thing when 'checking up' on our baggage. There was no misunderstanding and we were told complete lies just to get us on the plane. We get to London to find out our bags didn't come with us after being told they were which confirmed they lied. Arrive eventually at Glasgow and didn't receive our baggage until Tuesday.

Business class ARN-KEF-NYC-KEF (stopover) - ARN. Poor business class experience. Check in very smooth luggage drop good. Most annoying was the outdated seating felt like flying business class in 1988. Seat hardly reclining head rest too short the head side rest had no resistance whatsoever on either side so head was just rolling freely. No leg support. Worst about this was when flying at night the seats are about as comfortable as economy seats due to lack of flap reclination and no leg support. Also dirty table top. The food was ok and service adequate but nothing special. The entertainment unit was old fashioned and unresponsive so always jumping back and forth 2 pages instead of one. Another annoying experience is the lounge in Reykjavik for stop over flights. It is before passport control and US gates. In the lounge no one tells you when to leave or how much of a queue there is for passports so I went when boarding started but was far too early at the gate just standing around. The other time I went later but there was enormous queues for passport control so I had to run afterwards to the gate. The whole purpose of business class is comfort but the lounge placement just adds to stress level. If you stop over twice in Reykjavik Icelandair business might be good but for stop over only not worth it. Choose a proper transatlantic airline instead.

### Icelandair customer review
Flew Anchorage - Oslo via Reykjavik last August. Small plane but good price and direct flight from Anchorage made it well worth it. Hoped to repeat this trip this year but am surprised to find that the prices are higher but surprisingly - all return trips have 2 stops - have to go to Seattle to get back to Anchorage. That defeats the purpose of the direct flights. Would I recommend Icelandair - would have said yes but now with no direct return flights and higher prices would say no.

I was traveling alone with my Autistic toddler and they went above and beyond to help me. My daughter needs a 5 point seatbelt so I had to bring her car seat onboard they took it in and fitted it to her seat and boarded us first gate checked her stroller helped me with our hand luggage gave us extra blankets and checked on us throughout the flight. The entertainment was great the screens are interactive touch screens. The movie selection was really good a lot of new releases. The food was good my daughter had a kids meal included with her ticket and I ordered food from a menu. Luggage allowance is very generous even in economy we were allowed two 40lbs bags each and the website has very clear and concise information on what the dimensions and rules were so I wasn't stressed out about getting it wrong and having to pay for extra luggage or anything like that. My favorite part was that our return flights from Denver to London cost over $1.000 less than any of the other airlines! It's not glamorous and might not meet some peoples luxurious requirements but for people like me finding this airline was a godsend! Their ground staff and flight crew are all wonderful.

Saga class LHR-KEF-IAD. 11 December arrived at Heathrow. Heavy fog lots of flights late or canceled. Our flight 5 hours late so we missed our connection to IAD. This is where flying with a decent airline comes into play. We had all the comforts of the star alliance lounge to pass the time. Nothing exceptional but food and drinks seats and Wifi. Although understandably crowded with all the other delays staff kept us informed. Apologies from Iceland staff for the inconvenience. They arranged overnight accommodation at their own hotel in Reykjavik. Arranged transport to from hotel and booked us on the next days flight. On board LHR-KE . Short flight B757 seats 2 by 2 very wide with reasonable 40" space from the seats in front. Food good noise cancelling headsets offered. Entertainment system not very good. No controls on seats to headset so have to play with the screen on the passengers seat in front. As mentioned by earlier reviewer be careful when you connect the headset if the volume was set high by the previous user you could hurt your ear drums. Flight crew all nice. Next day KEF-IAD Saga lounge excellent - so much food and drink comfortable seats friendly staff and Internet. Lounge close to US departure gates. On board B757 6hr flight. Again on board service food excellent. Entertainment system is a let down. I wanted to see the ending of a film I watched on the London flight. To fast forward its not easy took nearly 10 minutes to forward an 80min film. No music available. Even with the old aircraft not so good entertainment system I still feel I made the right decision flying Iceland and would highly recommend them.

### Icelandair customer review
Travelled the route YYZ-KEF-ARN and back for a long weekend trip to Sweden in late November. I am very pleased with this route/airline because it provides the shortest/quickest way to get to Stockholm from Toronto and the transfers are easy. It spares you a great portion of the exhaustion experienced when flying through the major European hubs (because of longer flights and busier/larger airports). It took just below 5 hrs to fly from Toronto to Reykjavik short transfer of 45 mins at Keflavik airport another 2hr 45 min flight and we landed in Stockholm.

### Icelandair customer review
Not too thrilled with Icelandair. Was flying from Seattle to Amsterdam with a stopover in Reykjavik. The website gave me trouble - my first attempt at a webticket ended in an "unknown error" page on the payment step. Tried again with success but I was charged twice for one flight. I had to call the North American office several times with various opinions ranging from blasé "it might be normal" to "I can't explain it" but with each call ending with a promise to contact the Reykjavik office as soon as they opened and that somebody would get back to me. I spent nearly 2 hours over 2 weeks calling the North American office - there was never ever an apology or follow-up as promised. Flights were uncomfortable (and I'm not usually picky). On an 8 hour leg from Seattle to Reykjavik got the last row seat next to the rear lavatory -- these have been installed too close to the rear wall (such that they don't recline at all). Also the seat backs on two flights had a large ridge (~0.5") behind the thin padding of the seat and I got a red sore on each of these flights. Beyond this the entertainment system uses the last used volume setting when you start a film. If the last customer set it to full volume you're in for a real shock! Also all food is for fee (and the food is expensive and low quantity) and complementary drinks (soft drinks and hot tea/coffee only) come sporadically. Ultimately I'd absolutely avoid this airline unless you have plans to stay in Iceland (they are at least flexible with stopovers).

### Icelandair customer review
My wife and I used Icelandair because of the cheap price I got for the Saga Class on a Trip from Seattle to Paris. On the first leg of the trip from Seattle to Reykjavik my entertainment console malfunctioned even after it was rebooted. A complete waste of time for me. My wife's worked fine. On the trip back it worked OK but the screen was smaller than flight from Paris to Reykjavik. Otherwise I liked the service on all flights.

Last week I flew LHR-KEF and back after a 5-day stay in beautiful Iceland. Check-in and boarding at Heathrow was quick and the staff were lovely! The IFE in both flights were very good and showed a number of popular TV shows and movies as well as map views and information (speed height etc.) about the flight. In both flights we hit some turbulence in both which the crew did a fantastic job of persevering with. Flight attendants were delightful and happy to help. Both planes (757-200 and 757-300) were clean and modern. Seats were very comfy and the headrests even had amusing anecdotes and useful Icelandic phrases on them! Overall a very pleasant journey.

### Icelandair customer review
On August 17th my wife and I flew to Paris on Icelandair to spend one week celebrating our anniversary. Though the trip itself was wonderful our flight back turned out to be an awful experience due to terribly poor customer service. Our first flight was to Reykjavik from Paris a shorter flight departing at 8am. We arrived at the gate at 7.30 only a very short while after formal boarding had finished. The Icelandair gate agent was unwilling to discuss our boarding but instead referred us to another location giving the false impression that we would be better assisted there. Following direction we went to the main Icelandair kiosk to discuss our travel. While the gate attendant was short and non-amenable to our boarding the main attendant at the Icelandair kiosk was downright rude uncooperative and completely void of any empathy. The only choice we were given was to return our hotel and come back the next morning to purchase new tickets at full price. We ended up purchasing our tickets back from AA. Ultimately I have never experienced a more uncooperative airline. These days people shop not only for good prices but good service. I recommend that you don't waste your time or money with Icelandair.

I flew MSP-Paris-return in August 2013 and was very satisfied. We were late leaving Minneapolis due to a thunderstorm but were pleased to find out that when we landed in Reykjavik we had not missed our connecting flight to Paris because it was waiting for us. I don't know if that is standard policy for Icelandair but it was a relief to our group of about 16 people.

My wife and I recently travelled on Iceland Air Business (Saga) Class from Toronto to Oslo via Reykjavik. Even though the seat had a limited recline which we were aware of prior to booking service on all four flights was excellent for the price paid. The flight time from Toronto to Reykjavik is just over five hours and the flight was arrived slightly ahead of schedule. All four flights were on time. A hot meal with a selection of beverages was offered. On the flights between Iceland and Norway a cold meal was offered which was quite good. Their lounges in both Iceland and Oslo are quite good and we did not find them to be over crowded.

### Icelandair customer review
My family of 3 flew economy class SEA-KEF-AMS. Inflight entertainment was good for adults. It might be best for the longer flights to bring extra movies for children as there wasn't too much for them besides two movies and a bunch of episodes of Lazytown. Seating was a bit crammed but get what you pay for. The nicest part was the effort on the part of the airline to keep us all seated together without trying to gouge us or blow us off like other airlines. Customer service appears to still have a pulse with Icelandair. There was only a slight delay with one of the four flights but we still managed to leave on time. We read about the food for pay thing ahead of time and packed our own meals. Our child's airline provided meal was brought hot and early in the flight and she was happy with it. Overall though I am satisfied with this airline and would fly again.

Flew Helsinki-Keflavik 10th Sept returned 27th Sept in Saga Class. We flew from Melbourne Aus in one go via Helsinki. We were stuck in Helsinki airport for 9 hours in a lounge that was small and offered very little. Seeing the Iceland aircraft land and arrive on time in Helsinki was such a relief. We boarded on time. The seating was the old style business class seat but for a 4 hour flight we did not care too much. Comfort was acceptable. Food was ok and edible. The crew were very good. The entertainment system offerings were very dated and was the only let down of the flight. We landed in a storm. High winds and heavy rain. The pilots did a great job in landing the plane welcome to Iceland! The return trip was very good. Check-in was excellent. Business class lounge was excellent with good food and drink offerings. Same aircraft set up as our inward flight. Food on board was very good as were the staff. As mentioned the entertainment system was very ordinary. Overall a very good experience just let down by things that would not take too much to rectify.

One way Toronto to Heathrow via Reykjavik excellent price 2 free bags checked 23kg allowance brilliant IFE fast friendly check in given emergency exit seats at no additional cost on time flights very friendly staff on all sectors. No food but well explained and I would rather have cheaper fare anyway. 9-hour stopover at the Blue Lagoon an excellent way to spend a layover. Streaks ahead of Air Canada in every aspect. Now just start flying to Winnipeg please!

### Icelandair customer review
I flew return to Denver from Heathrow on Sep 8th. Paid a large amount for a meal on outbound flight was able to stock up with food for the return journey. The plane seats were comfortable enough sad to have to pay for ear phones though. My return journey was marred by an 0630 landing at KEF and finding that I could not transfer my 1610 flight to the 0740 flight without paying 1200 dollars. I sat in an empty airport for 10 hours. The onboard food menu is very poor and dull and does not justify the prices charged. The plane was clean and tidy.

### Icelandair customer review
We chose bulkhead seats in Saga class not knowing there were no foot rests. Since I have serious leg problems I need to have my legs raised somewhat during most of the flight. There was nothing to put my feet on. The staff were excellent allowing me to use my carry on for support but this was not adequate. I had trouble walking the entire visit to the UK. I am dreading the flight home. We had to wait in Toronto and Iceland plane was late leaving no place to sit in Iceland airport so had to stand for 30 minutes. No boarding preference were discouraged from using the lounge because of distance to walk from gate. No indication on ticket or booking regarding dinner service. The only difference from economy was the wider seat. I will have to fly home but never again.

### Icelandair customer review
Travelled from Seattle to Stockholm and back via KEF. Planes are fine service is fine food and drink are exactly what you get these days on any airline. Entertainment system is better than most competitors. KEF is a small airport and they don't call out gate announcements so you need to pay attention. That isn't Icelandair's fault. I travel extensively and would use Icelandair again in a heartbeat. My only issue is that they cancelled their partner program with Alaska so I didn't get any points!

### Icelandair customer review
I took Icelandair from Copehagen Denmark to Toronto Canada with a stop over in Reykjavik. I was very satisfied with the quality of the flight. If you look for safety control of the plane during turbulence communication pilot-passengers during important moments of the flight you make a good choice in Icelandair. If you rate the food quality the size of the seats and other superficial aspects on a flight you may not be happy but your opinion stays superficial. I flew on so many airlines that had good in-flight service but the pilots disappointed that now I can make a difference. On Iceland Air they sat me on the comfort class and felt I had a very good in- flight service as well as a very smooth flight.

### Icelandair customer review
MSP-KEF-CPH and back. Impressed with the space and legroom in Economy Class. We also liked the multiple entertainment options at each individual seat. The flight attendants were friendly and helpful and welcomed us with blankets and pillows as we boarded the plane. The only negative was the fact that we were served only drinks (no complementary food) but we were told this in advance so we prepared by bringing our own snacks. There was food for purchase and all items were reasonably priced and tasty. KEF is an easy airport to navigate and their passport control was quick and efficient to move us through processing during a short layover. We will definitely fly with Icelandair again and since they have recently opened some new gateways in the U.S. and Europe we will definitely be considering these options on our next international trip.

### Icelandair customer review
LHR-KEF-BOS return. Checked in online for all flights which worked well with the advance seat selection under the 'My Booking' page on the Icelandair website. Check-in queues were all very short and all flights departed on time. Inflight entertainment system is on par with other major airlines and certainly better than what many US airlines offer on similar flights. Food is buy on board but as we already knew this we made other arrangements. Connection in Iceland carried out with ease only criticism is that boarding in Keflavik is rather disorganised several flights leave at the same time from one corridor and announcements are not made for any of the flights making it difficult to identify which queue is for which gate/flight. That said I would definitely fly Icelandair again as these flights seem to break up what can be a long transatlantic journey.

### Icelandair customer review
Checked in online for both journeys and on both we had our seats moved without warning or advise. On the way out we were only notified at the gate and told it was our fault as we should have checked for any reseating and reprinted boarding cards. On return checked at information and advised moved again and sitting about 15 rows apart. It appears they under estimate Economy Plus and alter seating just before take off. Sensible thing would be to over estimate and release later.

### Icelandair customer review
I fly internationally about 4-6 times a year on various airlines and my recent Icelandair flights from Boston to Saint Petersburg was one of the best. The plane was new comfortable and very clean. The blankets they offered were plush and cozy. The airline doesn't offered free meals for economy class but the options offered for purchase are restaurant grade at a negligible cost (the most expensive dish was about 10 euros). I tried oatmeal salad and mini hamburgers all of which were delicious. All of these made the flight experience more pleasant than having free airline food like other airlines. I also appreciated the on time departures which insured that I did not worry about missing my tight connections. The staff was extremely friendly and gracious and even covered me with a blanket when I fell asleep on a flight from Saint Petersburg to Keflavik. I highly recommend using this wonderful airline where small details make a big difference.

### Icelandair customer review
Economy Comfort YYZ-KEF-HEL. Very satisfied with Icelandair. Flight left Toronto slightly late due to passenger problems which made for a tight connection in KEF. You have to go through security and immigration in KEF so I only had a few minutes before boarding the onward flight to Helsinki. Both flights were clean comfortable and with great service from a professional and efficient crew. On arrival in Helsinki I discovered that my suitcase had not made the onward flight. A good test is how airlines perform when things go wrong and I was given an overnight kit at the airport kept up to date on the bag's progress which was delivered to my hotel the following day.

For the second year in a row we flew Icelandair out of Boston. Last time our destination was Scandinavia. We decided to make Iceland this year's destination. We were again pleasantly surprised by the value provided. The cabin staff were very accommodating. Flight was on time. Our luggage was on the carousal almost simultaneously with our clearing customs. Reykjavik airport is clean organized and easy to manoeuvre in and out. Plenty of good food options at the airport.

### Icelandair customer review
CDG-KEF KEF-IAD. CDG Icelandair check-in counters were a real mess hundreds of passengers queuing with only 3 incredibly slow agents. Luckily I was flying SAGA class and I stood for half an hour only. Business class Lounge at CDG 1 is worthless. Flight from CDG-KEF was good and comfortable the crew were friendly and hospitable. Food was very good entertainment excellent seats of old version but comfortable enough. KEF Airport arrival hall is a big mess with only 3 belts for almost 8 arrivals at the same time so you wait around 20 min. A huge supermarket is located in the Arrival area. KEF-IAD. Check in was fast and smooth with no problems SAGA class lounge was excellent food and drinks were both fine. Flight was comfortable and crew were nice. I enjoyed flying Icelandair and I will sure do that again in the near future.

### Icelandair customer review
Denver to Stockholm via Reykjavik and Paris-Reykjavik-Denver on return. Be wary about the 1 hour layovers that are offered on many of the flights between the US and Europe. On our return trip the first leg from Paris to Reykjavik was delayed an hour. Given that we only had a one hour layover in Reykjavik any delay was worrisome at CDG airport we were given very little information. Turns out they held the planes in Reykjavik for us. From what I could see this was not an isolated incident. Economy Comfort" class is a strange limbo in between their economy seating and the highest end Saga Class. We flew Saga on the way and Economy Comfort on the way back so experienced both. Saga was fairly nice with only 5 rows of large 2 abreast seats. More like a business class than a normal first class the seats don't recline all the way and have seen better days. But it was comfortable and the service excellent (although food was mediocre). Economy Comfort is just a few rows directly behind Saga Class meaning that there's not a single seat in this section that isn't exposed to the front of the plane lavatory that serves the economy class. I was in row 6 with exactly the same seats as the Saga Class and with no separation between the rows but with a curtain over the tops of the seats in front of me. The lavatory is right on the middle of all of these seats and it's where people loiter about waiting for their turn the slam of the door was consistent. So you get either a bigger seat in one of the rows or no middle passenger in the others and free drinks and the same food they serve in economy but you don't have to pay for it. I wouldn't pay extra for economy comfort unless you're willing to pay a lot more to sit near the front near the bathroom. Unless I was flying either regular economy or Saga Class at a really great price and most importantly with a reasonable layover time in Reykjavik I don't think I would fly Icelandair again.

### Icelandair customer review
Just returned from a trip to Amsterdam via Iceland. No complaints about the on-board service. Pillows and blankets waiting on every seat on the long leg (from Denver to Iceland). Bottled water to pick up on entry into plane and usual drinks served during flight. Luckily I read a review that mentioned you have to purchase food in economy seating so I brought my own. They should mention that more prominently when you book your flight. Also did not know about option to stay over in Iceland for a few days supposedly at no extra ticket cost but I didn't see this offer when I was booking. My only complaint was how little leg room there is on the Boeing 757-200 which is the long leg of the flight. The shorter leg (Iceland to Amsterdam) had the normal amount of leg room; it was a Boeing 757-300. You could always ask for more beverages as much as you like. It is easier to get their attention if you go to the pantry as they are not always walking up and down the aisles.

### Icelandair customer review
Flew from Heathrow to Reykjavik and back. A bit disappointed. Had to check in each of us online separately as the system would not do it together even though we had one booking reference. On board bad legroom and food had to be paid for (like a low cost carrier). No tea available and only one glass of water. They were more concerned with trying to flog duty free than bringing more water round. The parched passenger next to me and I had to specially request one more glass. Crew polite but not friendly on way out but a bit friendlier on the way back. Would recommend but only as better than low cost airlines (just) which also ply this route.

### Icelandair customer review
Returned from our flight to Berlin Germany and back. 2 stopovers each way - in Iceland and in Copenhagen. We paid for Saga class but it really doesn't compare to other airlines' business class. Did not find the seats particularly comfortable for trying to sleep the movies were a bit dated and most of the cabin staff were okay but not particularly helpful. On the long flight out of Denver both my husband's and my entertainment centres did not work properly nor did the outlet for plugging in the computer. No attempts were made to rectify that situation. Boarding was fairly haphazard with no preferred boarding for business class passengers on 5 of our 6 flights. On our return flight we could not even access seating area outside of the gate until an attendant showed up to check passports and board passes everybody stood around in the hallway. Again no preferred line for business class. Several times we had to get on or off the plane on the tarmac and either walked to the terminal or were bussed. It was pretty cold rainy and windy so that was quite miserable. Lounges were decent - SAS in Copenhagen and Icelandair in Reykjavik. No lounge in Berlin. Food on the flight was good excellent food at the Icelandair lounge. On our outbound trip there was a significant delay in leaving Denver due to a thunderstorm. They held the connecting plane in Iceland so were able to make our connection. Our luggage made it fine. Unfortunately on the return trip which had no delays 2 pieces of our luggage did not leave Iceland with us. So much for having the business class luggage labelled "priority".

### Icelandair customer review
Round trip LHR-KEF October 23rd and October 27th 2012. Economy. Never flown Icelandair before this flight and my first impressions were mixed. Flight was on time and the aircraft was smart quiet comfortable and clean. However the cabin crew going weren't exactly friendly they were polite but didn't bother to smile. Return trip was similar flight was on time and the aircraft (757-300) was very smart and comfortable. However the cabin crew were worse than the outbound trip they were inefficient and quite rude at times and missed my row completely when they were doing the drinks service. The Captain coming back was excellent very detailed route details and sounded reassuring. The in flight entertainment was excellent turned on before take off even although the system was slow at times. Overall Icelandair are very good in terms of punctuality flight crew and comfort however the cabin crew let down Icelandair here.

May 22 2013. Flight 630 Iceland to Toronto. Very hungry because food was for sale only drinks to satisfy the customer. The passenger seated behind me was a mother with a child who cried the entire trip. Said passenger tried to stop her daughter from crying by playing with her legs tapping them on the back of my seat. Passengers squashed in on very few seats. All in all I'm very dissatisfied with Icelandair.

### Icelandair customer review
SEA-AMS on DE via FRA. Uncertain of exactly how long my business trip would take I booked one way segments. Overall I would give the experience 3.5 out of 5 stars mostly because of the fact the airline uses Boeing 757/200 and 300 series aircraft while I prefer the more spacious less confining comfort of twin aisle or wide body jets. Service wise Saga class is worth the upgrade if for nothing more than the extra legroom. The seats are old generation recliner seats like those found on US domestic first class years ago. They are fine for day flights but I wouldn't want to attempt a comfortable nights rest in one. Meal service on board is limited to 2 choices of entrees and the flight attendant told me one of them is usually a fish dish of some kind. I only had just short of an hour for my connecting flight from KEF to SEA so I didn't have time to stop off in the lounge. It's interesting to note that all of Icelandair's flights arrive and depart KEF around the same time so it can get very busy at the customer service counters. It wasn't a bad experience overall but this wouldn't be my first choice for transpacific flights. In fact the price was the most appealing factor in choosing to use Icelandair.

### Icelandair customer review
Round trip Denver/Reykjavik in June 2012 in economy coach. All was fine. Price was excellent. We understood that Icelandair is an economy-priced airline and we were pleased. We are trying Icelandair again at the end of August 2013 doing Denver/Paris round-trip in Economy Comfort. We are doing this solely to have a little extra room and no one sitting with us in our aisle. For the price we think it will be fine. Friends we traveled with to Reykjavik last year are using Icelandair again for a Denver/Glasgow round trip. They said they were pleased last year so are using the airline again.

### Icelandair customer review
Bought a Saga class (their business class ticket) from LAX to FRA. First leg turned out to be economy on Frontier which was not clear to Denver. Flight in Denver to Reykjavik was delayed. No one at airport to talk to since Lufthansa does the ground service. No body available on the phone since their customer service does not operate on Sunday! Missing my connection means I miss all my business meetings and I'm in Frankfurt for just a day. They don't even have a lounge in Denver. No food served from LAX to Denver. Amazingly bad for business class. This airline does not care.

### Icelandair customer review
BOS-KEF-GLA and return. Saga Class. Everything was okay in Boston but when we reached the airport in Iceland the only way to board the connecting plane to Glasgow was to climb up steps to the aircraft. As a senior with disabilities this was no mean feat. No assistance was offered either. It was apparent that the airline people do not care for any passengers other than the Icelandic people. After paying extra for Saga class I was disappointed in the service. I don't appreciate the rudeness of the Icelandic people. I have flown all over the world and this airline it by far one of the worst. The boarding area for international flights is total chaos. There is no organization at all. Saga Class and Economy Comfort are supposed to board first. This did not happen. I would not recommend this airline to anyone.

### Icelandair customer review
My new husband and I decided to take the 5hr flight to Scotland (Honeymoon vacation) because it was the cheapest by far. We had done several 5hr flights before and thought we would be fine. I have never seen a people that so openly made it apparent they hate Americans. It started after the flight took off and I asked the attendant for a drink of water. She sneered at me nodded and I never got the drink. When the food car came by she went past us. At first I thought it was just us but then I noticed they ignored three other American couples. Halfway through the flight two small children started playing in the isle. I thought they would stop it but no. And when i asked them to make it stop because the children were kicking peoples seats the attendant just gave me this bored look and said something to the children in Icelandic. Sure the seats were really small and cramped and the food and entertainment were ok but that is to be expected.

### Icelandair customer review
LHR-KEF-BOS JFK-KEF-LHR Saga Class. Punctual flights with older aircraft (Boeing 757) but well maintained inside. On demand IFE with a wide choice of entertainment. Polite and willing flight attendants. And plenty of good food and drink. The dinner back from JFK (Icelandic lamb) was one of the better in flight meals I've had and the rest were more than passable. Saga Class is an 'old fashioned' business class. There's no flat bed but a nice wide leather seat. I chose Icelandair as our work travel budget is currently constrained and a fully changeable and refundable ticket was two thirds the price of a non changeable business class ticket on other carriers. My only niggle and it's small but ought to be addressed is that some of the overhead bins in Saga Class were used for storage of blankets and crew bags. Premium passengers should not be fighting for room in the overheads bins. But overall I'm well satisfied and will use again.

### Icelandair customer review
I have flown Icelandair on many occasions. In the 60s to Luxemburg when it was the best and cheapest way to Europe from North America. Later to Scandinavia at which point I could afford the Business Class. Occasionally in Coach when the other grades were full but I needed to get there better than SAS could provide. My last flight to Reikjavik from Toronto was hell. Only economy was available when we booked in January although our preference was for the better seats or business class. When we found our seats they were the non-reclining row ahead of the wing door and as a very tall person this was not a good sign. After about an hour into the flight the agony in my legs began. My estimate is that this particular row had a seat pitch of 29 inches as opposed to the claimed 32 which would have been ok. Having an aisle seat I stretched out but was sternly forbidden by officious attendants. I apologized for being in their way and asked about some relief from the 29 inches which was not available since the plane appeared to be sold out. What concerned me  beyond the obvious personal discomforts was the continuing attitude of the flight attendants. We are returning on our flight back tomorrow. One of our party experienced a slight injury to an ankle in Iceland and we have requested wheelchair assistance within the airport in Stockholm and Reikjavik. I assume all will be done properly or I will trouble you again with my addendum to this critique. Please believe that I have not written these critiques very often at all but I like Iceland and Icelandair and would like them to do well.

JFK to LHR via KEF - 15/16 March. On time departure and arrival. Comfortable seating and pleasant staff. No free food in economy - just complementary soft drinks - so you avoid the usual airline food! Good value too especially if flying one-way only. Customer service staff in Keflavik airport very helpful. I inadvertently left my wallet on the flight from JFK - they returned to me intact before boarding the connecting flight to LHR. Highly recommended.

MUC-KEF KEF-MUC: Superb value! Both flights were on time. Enough legroom and very good seating. Great IFE with a broad variety of movies music and information about Iceland. Spotless plane. Everything perfect except that you have to pay for the food and quality of the food was OK but nothing special.

SFB Orlando - Iceland - LHR. Check in quick and friendly business lounge at Sanford absolutely terrible. One kettle for hot water one coffee flask pre packaged cookies crisps. If you want hot food they will order it for you from the terminal and you will have to pay them. Not up to international standards. Flight itself was pleasant but the food flying into Sanford was better then flying out. Seats comfortable entertainment good service pleasant. Lounge at home city Iceland good with the airport full of duty free shops and all selling the same goods. Boarding at Iceland unorganised with no priority given to children disabled or business. On board toilets clean food ok seats comfortable. Although the aircraft used on European flights are not as good as American routes. All flights on time. Comment I would make is I still don't know when they fly to Orlando as it is seasonal. Hope they would could make it more clear on their Internet site.

### Icelandair customer review
Very poor service. Loud muzak piped in impossible to turn down or turn off. No in-flight meal only one barely more than half-filled small cup of coffee on a 6 hour flight. Some of the attendants were haughty and rude. Focus on trying to sell you things rather than on trying to make your flight more comfortable. On the plus side seats and legroom were reasonably good fares are very inexpensive and check-in and boarding were carried out very efficiently. Flight 614 November 21-222012 New York New York (JFK) to Keflavik Iceland (KEF).

I traveled to London on Icelandair in November 2012. We purchased Economy Comfort class of service for less than what most of the other airlines were charging for regular coach. This allows you access to the airport lounges which in my opinion is worth every penny. The SAGA lounge in Reykjavik where we had our layover was very nice and a great break after the long trip across the ocean from Orlando FL. Seating was great and the entertainment options in seat were plentiful. Food on board was good but nothing extraordinary. (Food is also included free of charge in Economy Comfort vs Economy). Staff were friendly and available as well. I would recommend Icelandair for their transatlantic service. I plan to use them again soon.

### Icelandair customer review
London - Iceland - Sanford FL. Very quick check in lounge just OK in T1. On board B757 aircraft clean crew friendly seats excellent - wide with plenty of leg room. Food OK selection of two main courses. For the 2.5hr flight not worth the extra money. Lounge in Iceland small - very friendly airport but very crowded (Christmas rush). Onward flight 7.5hr - very pleasant. Food selection good and tasty entertainment good selection nice amenity kit. Seats good but one negative point is that if the person in front fully reclines it gets uncomfortable. Flight and crew excellent. For the extra money paid for this leg it was well worth it.

### Icelandair customer review
10th Dec 2012 KEF-LHR. Still quite a nice airline although it is shame they have got rid of their free meal service as it still feels like a rip off compared to the budget airlines who fly. Icelandair still has this budget airline feeling. The free non-alcoholic drinks are nice but the flight attendants only came around once. The in flight screens are a nice touch. It is such a shame that this airline doesn't have bigger planes for their transatlantic routes such as A340's. I will fly them again as they are always punctual and reliable but the flight tickets should be far more competitive otherwise the budget airlines as we speak are winning my vote.

### Icelandair customer review
I was travelling with a group of 16 from Keflavik to London. We had already booked our seats. For some reason Icelandair changed all this without letting us know. We were seated all over the plane. When we approached the staff with our problems there was no will in correcting this - in fact they were very rude. When we finally got to the plane we noticed that most of our original seats were empty. Cabin crew showed the same attitude as the staff at check-in - rude and not willing to do anything for the group. I know that Icelandair has attractive prices - but my advise is stay away!

### Icelandair customer review
Unexpectedly good flight especially for the price. On Red eye flight were provided pillow and blanket. Kids under 12 got free meal free headphones and a coloring book.

Paris-Reykjavik-Denver was pretty nice. Seats were as comfortable as any other airline in Economy flight attendants were helpful and friendly (blankets were offered they brought around water and juice had lots of smiles etc.) planes were clean and flights on time. I'll agree that the queuing area in Reykjavik left something to be desired - not much room lots of planes leaving at the same time short on restrooms and water fountains. The in-flight entertainment had a lot of old programming but there was plenty of variety and we enjoyed seeing things we'd missed the first time around anyway. We had a good experience and really loved getting from Paris to Denver with only one plane change.

KEF-MUC. Pleasant flight good food even though you had to pay for it. On time boarding and a very clean aircraft. Seats were comfortable and the departure was at a civilized time. The in-fight entertainment was a good selection although they could choose more recent films and a wider selection of series episodes. Over all it was a comfortable flight and was on time for a connecting flight with Emirates.

### Icelandair customer review
Helsinki-Seattle and New York-Helsinki via Reykjavik. Experience was a pleasant surprise. The seat was more spacious than expected service good both at airports and on board the flights on time and well timed for my connections to Anchorage and from San Juan. The menu was interesting and to some degree compensated the lack of inclusive service on board. The main downside is the waste of mileage points on legs with no codeshare with OneWorld or Star Alliance but the easiness of the transits and the price of the flights nevertheless made this an overall good deal.

### Icelandair customer review
I paid almost 40% more for a premium economy for a flight from NY to Paris. Although you may have slightly more legroom the seats are not any more comfortable ie. you have two choices of seats where the back of the seat does not recline at all or where the armrest cannot be lifted therefore if the seat next to you is empty you can't stretch out. I truly felt deceived. As for the food service this is the worst. More specifically the food service includes giving you a menu of items to choose from example a sandwich or oatmeal. It's not your ordinary airline meal which includes a complete meal of a starter main course and desert. This was an international flight.

BOS-KEF-MAN. LHR-KEF-BOS. All flights on time. Consistently efficient service and tentative flight attendants. There is a wide selection of movies on the IFE system.

### Icelandair customer review
MAN-SEA worst flight ever. Service was horrible no blankets was provided unless requested. Staff rude unless you needed to buy something. Food is not provided you can buy it from them and the choices was poor. Aircraft was small and uncomfortable. Entertainment system contains music/movies of a decade ago. They do provide complementary drinks such as juice and water. While they serve you your complementary drink a napkin that states that 1000 years ago a native Icelander went to America and coffee tea and soda were not complementary - effectively slapping their customers in the face namely me. I would never recommend it to anyone.

### Icelandair customer review
One of the worst airlines I have flown with in over 20 years. Terrible reliability and most staff poor at customer service to the point of rudeness. Shame they have virtual monopoly on visiting this wonderful country. They do not appear to have enough planes to cover their routes so delays on one flight cause knock on delays on other routes. Particularly bad delays at KEF airport.

Washington DC to Paris (with layovers in Iceland) and then returned from London to DC through Canada. It was the worst flying experience I've had. The airport is small with only 2 toilets per sex and only one sink. On top of that they had 3 major flights departing at the same time leading to long lines of people waiting to use the restroom. They also had very few chairs in the waiting area so most people were standing or waiting on the ground. No free food on the flight - not even pretzels. They do not turn on the air- conditioning while boarding the plane so it's incredibly hot and uncomfortable. On top of all this they gave us no notice that we would have to go through customs upon landing in Canada and then go check back in to another airline. Our tickets did not mention this at all. They only gave us a 2 hour layover to complete all these tasks. We almost missed our flight and we were so rushed our luggage did not make the flight. It was an absolutely awful experience. It is not worth the cost savings.

### Icelandair customer review
What Icelandair executive came up with the bright idea of having four different Icelandair flights (Denver NYC Boston and Minneapolis) all board from the same narrow overcrowded and largely chair-free little wing of the Reykjavik Airport within 15 minutes of each other? What a mess. When we left the airport on Sunday boarding lines for Denver crossed the boarding lines for NYC which crossed the boarding lines for Boston and Mpls. All unbelievably poorly planned.

YYZ-KEF-GLA - left an hour late so had only a 20 minute connection but KEF is so compact it was not an issue as the connecting gate was adjacent. Eat before you fly as food onboard costs extra. 757 not the best aircraft and flight was full. MAN-KEF-YYZ on the return. On the KEF-YYZ I was impressed that the flight director announced that a severely allergic passenger was onboard and asked that nobody eat nuts. They also did not serve any menu items with nuts. As the parent of a severely allergic child I was impressed at the level of care. Really great flight crew on all flights and the seatback entertainment has 45 movies lots of TV shows and some local Icelandic music and media also.

### Icelandair customer review
We flew from Iceland to Denver. Impossible boarding situation. All passengers board at the same time. Complete chaos. To top it off they boarded two other flights right next to each other at the same time. Seats very uncomfortable. Good price but overall not worth the savings. Cabin service spotty. Don't think we will try them again.

### Icelandair customer review
Boston to Bergen Norway and then back from Stockholm. The flights were on time the cabin staff professional pleasant and capable. We were in economy class and the food was good and reasonably priced. Cabins were clean and inviting. There was an excellent selection of entertainment that our teenage children enjoyed. I will fly Icelandair again whenever our plans call for travel to Scandinavia.

### Icelandair customer review
Worst airline I've travelled on especially given the amenities and services usually provided on International Carriers. Any discount that appears up front is not worth it. They do not provide any food onboard as part of the price. You must buy all food on board if hungry - delivery service is archaic and slow and usually food options are limited. Food onboard is overpriced as well. Online check-in from our hotel was difficult and in the end we gave up and used the old fashioned check in at the airport. I appreciate Iceland promoting itself through its airline but this is a disservice. Inflight entertainment is very limited as well.

### Icelandair customer review
OSLO-KEF-YYZ one way on business class. I have flown Icelandair before so knew what to expect. Their business class across the Atlantic in August was cheaper than star alliance economy! Flights on time service excellent. We had two small kids and staff were great with them. Food good and has improved since I flew with them a year or so ago. They are a good value transatlantic option that can be inconsistent but are a good option. Transiting Keflavik is a bit unique and weather dependent but still more pleasant than CDG Frankfurt and Heathrow. I fly often and Icelandair has gone up in my book while the other have gone down.

### Icelandair customer review
The airline changed my confirmed window seat to middle seat without notification at the last minute as we were entering the plane. When asked why they stated that it's their policy to have family members seat next to each other without spaces in between. When asked another flight attendant they verified that there is no such policy. It turns out that a couple occupied our window seat and the seat next to it so it was obvious that they reassigned the seats so that another couple can sit together. When we contacted the Icelandair customer service they only returned with an automatically generated message without any explanation. Even if we had reserved these seats 6 months in advance they claim that they don't guarantee the seating.

### Icelandair customer review
GLA-YHZ YYZ-GLA. Outbound flights on time. No seatback TV on 3 of our 4 flights (only on Toronto - KEF) but loan of PSP offered instead. For some reason one of our pre-booked seats on flight to Halifax had been given away. Check-in agent at Glasgow said she couldn't access seat-map but when we queried this she suddenly was able to access it. We were given seats together elsewhere on the plane. Online check-in not available to FI to/from Canada Flight from Pearson left 1 hr late due to a late change of runway in poor weather. We were the last pax to make it on to the flight to Glasgow. Very slow security checks in Keflavik - more lanes needed. In fairness they did announce on tannoy that connecting flights to LHR and GLA were being held. You don't go through security at KEF from Europe to N America only on return. I wouldn't count on being able to buy a book etc at KEF as shopping facilities are pretty limited. Staff were pleasant on all flights and baggage delivery was pretty quick.

### Icelandair customer review
Flew Dulles to Helsinki on July 4 and returned from Bergen to Dulles on July 25. Was very impressed with all aspects of service. Flights were on time everything on plane worked all support staff and attendants were friendly and personable. Saga economy class was great empty seat between us as promised tried a little bit of everything from food menu and enjoyed the free beer and wine. We are already thinking about when we will fly back to Keflavik on Icelandair to visit for a couple days!

### Icelandair customer review
Just returned with my son from a short break in Iceland. Its a wonderful place with nice people but badly served by its airline. Flights there and back delayed due to lack of available aircraft/late arrival of incoming flight and waiting for the return leg from Iceland there were constant airport announcements of badly delayed Icelandair flights to destinations all over Europe for the same reason. Surely a logistics problem that could be resolved. Terrible staff on flight out lovely staff on return so some people in the company do know about customer care but culturally and corporately this is not embedded.

### Icelandair customer review
We travelled out to Iceland in April 2012. On the way out the aircraft was nearly full however Icelandair had made good use of the seats available. Unfortunately this could not be said on our return trip. We had booked in online and given seats near the front of the aircraft. The flight was called and we gave our tickets to board. The lady said we had a seat change. We got our seats where a gentleman said the seat between us was his! What made me upset was the aircraft was full. Instead of moving people around as in the first flight the first of 10 row had only 6 people in it. Know the front 2 rows of seat are bigger however the remaining seat were the same size with only a curtain as separation which can be moved. Icelandair need to have a think about all its passengers comfort.

### Icelandair customer review
Nice trip from Keflavik back home to Frankfurt. The flight was on time ground and flight attendant were friendly and helpful the cabin was nice clean and roomy enough for that route and everything was very uncomplicated and professionally done. Drinks were free headphones were not and food was average but quite expensive but that's not what really makes up the quality of an airline. A nice experience for a good price. Would book them again without a doubt.

### Icelandair customer review
I made a reservation in Oct of 2011 for a trip I was taking in June 2012. I got an email that said if your ticket was booked prior to April 2012 and you were flying Coach your baggage requirements had changed since they had added a new class called Comfort Coach. Those new customers who were going to pay more for the privilege could take on 2 carry ons not to exceed 20 lbs. each while the old coach customers me could only carry on 13 pounds. I had to get another valise that complied with this new ruling cutting down considerably on what I could pack. When I tried to upgrade so I could take more luggage I was told expedia had to do it. When I called they said no they couldn't do it try Icelandair. I arrived at the gate boarding passes having been printed there was no provision of separating luggage weights so all my travail was for nothing. I could have taken an elephant on board if it could fit in the overhead. The only thing complimentary on the plane was water. The flight attendants were professional but on the second leg of the trip they didn't even pass out a water bottle. I think I would rather cut my trip one day shorter and take Air France where they still treat you like a human being on a transatlantic trip. Expect to be fitted into a sardine can then you will have no surprises but a meal and a drink still goes a long way to making things a little more pleasurable. The airport in Iceland is another trip altogether. About 25 seats for a 125 people. Nothing was open when we arrived so it wasn't like you could buy a fresh sandwich or drink. Very unwelcoming. I was am not a satisfied customer and wont be coming back.

### Icelandair customer review
JFK-KEF-CDG return. Have flown Icelandair several times taking advantage of stopover in Iceland. This trip took flight that arrived in Iceland at midnight to witness midnight sun. Well worth it. No problems with any flight. Always on time comfortable and entertainment system excellent. Staff very efficient and welcoming. Only negative is limited food menu and from that not everything available. This for sure is an airline and not a restaurant. One must go through customs between flights at KEF and the airport signs and directions are confusing. Seating is inadequate there also. That is not reflective of the airline itself.

### Icelandair customer review
LHR-KEF and back. This was the first time we flew Icelandair and we were very happy. Seats are comfortable soft drinks are free and food can be purchased. Crew friendly and helpful toilets clean. All flights on time.

### Icelandair customer review
Round trip JFK-KEF-AMS in Business Class. Seats were wider meals were wonderful service was great and the onboard entertainment was excellent. Yes it is like domestic business class but the extended pitch of the seats compared to coach made it easy for sleeping. The trip went very fast compared to what it would have been like in coach on any airline. Economy Plus is located behind Business Class and it seems to be dark back there because it is by the exit doors and Coach Galley. If you aren't used to or can't afford Business Class on the major airlines this is a nice alternative and I would recommend it. Check-in is easy and the personnel are helpful. The use of the lounges in airports during a layover was a wonderful perk very relaxing and greatly appreciated.

### Icelandair customer review
We flew from IAD-Reykjavik-Paris. FAs were polite and efficient - especially to our children. The flights were on time and most importantly this airline did not change the itinerary on us. The seats in economy were adequate and the movies selection extensive. We would fly with Icelandair again.

### Icelandair customer review
MSP-TOR-KEF-CDG. Planes are clean huge choice for entertainment. Food choices are very good. Air Canada somehow messed up our luggage transfer in Toronto however Icelandair had it the next day.

### Icelandair customer review
IAD-KEF Saga class. Check-in fast and easy. Icelandair now use the Air France lounge at Dulles. Crew great and food outstanding with many choices. Flight smooth and fast flight attendants friendly and very attentive. Read some negative things about Icelandair and never had a problem in all my 14 flights with them. My only gripe is that they do not post a check in time for passengers at IAD.

### Icelandair customer review
Paris to New York via Keflavik - 7 May. Great service onboard flights on time seats comfortable staff friendly and helpful. Check-in at Paris was confusing. Huge queue had developed before staff arrived to open the counters. Check-in staff were helpful - I had tried to check-in online but not allowed and no one could give a reason. Easy transfer at Keflavik but airport waiting areas inadequate for the number of passengers waiting - many having to sit on floor. But this an airport criticism not one of Icelandair which is often a convenient and inexpensive way to travel from Europe to the USA if you do not mind changing planes.

### Icelandair customer review
Our flight started at Seattle airport we were greeted by very pleasant people at the desk. We had a problem at security with one item in our carry on baggage we went to the Icelandair counter and they quickly checked our item through for free. Flight attendants were friendly and very helpful. We quickly connected with our next Icelandair flight to Stockholm and again a very pleasant trip. All in all it was one of the best flights we have had to Europe.

### Icelandair customer review
Outbound flight OK except for entertainment monitor not working. On the return flight the cabin crew allowed two men to board the plane swigging beer from open beer bottles and proceeded to chat to them whilst they seated them in the emergency exit row. The cabin crew also made no attempt to stop one of the beer-drinkers from using his mobile phone during the flight. This lax approach to safety by the cabin crew is greatly concerning.

### Icelandair customer review
LHR-KEF-LHR. Nice check in staff and the cabin crew kind courteous and very helpful. Flight out delayed 30 mins. Seats were quite comfortable and leg room adequate. Inflight entertainment was good. Prices for food onboard are quite high. Inbound flight was ok check-in at Keflavik quick and the flight boarded quickly. It was on an older aircraft and my inflight usb charger port was not working. Other than that it was a pleasant flight and service from the cabin crew pleasant as well. The ticket prices are a little on the higher end of the spectrum considering food isn't included with the ticket.

### Icelandair customer review
SEA-KEF-LHR. Flew from SEA to LHR on Dec 24th Premium Economy was very good leg room IFE and food was nice clean aeroplane both directions. On return trip there was a delay in London due to bad weather over the UK and outbound flight to KEF was delayed. Icelandair ground staff in London were professional and helpful. Upon arrival in KEF ground staff again very helpful and sorted out a hotel and taxi in KEF. Flew back to SEA next day in Saga class again service was very good and I will certainly fly Icelandair again.

### Icelandair customer review
BOS-KEF-LHR Jan 2012. I was booked in Premium Economy and figured this would be a regular Economy seat with a blocked middle seat but it turned out to be a regular Business Class seat on both legs (2+2 on 757-200). Personal space was very good (akin to domestic First in the US) good recline and a good IFE system. IFE was touch-screen with a good selection of On-Demand movies and audio channels. The Premium Economy service was different to Business Class service - even though we were in the same cabin with the same seats. Premium Economy meals were sandwiches and salads - Business Class looked like a more substantial meal tray with glassware. Premium Economy could use the Business Class lounge at both Boston and Keflavik. A very pleasant trip.

### Icelandair customer review
LHR-KEF and KEF-FRA (economy). Flew two 757-200WL and was impressed! Check-in was fast in both London and Keflavik and Icelandair ground personnel there to offer assistance. Both flights were packed however we managed to board on time and arrived in both KEF and FRA ahead of schedule. For a semi low-cost airline I was impressed as all passengers were able to use the on demand inflight entertainment free of charge. In economy we were offered a free drink however food had to be paid for which in my opinion was overpriced. Facilities in the refurbished Keflavik airport were excellent.

### Icelandair customer review
MAN-KEF-MAN outbound flight was reasonable and luckily I was able to change my seats when I checked in online as we had not been allocated seats together. Inbound flight was delayed 11 hours. We were sent an email with details of a 9.5 hour delay in advance but when we arrived at KEF the delay was even longer totalling 11 hours. Explanation was delayed plane incoming to KEF. Very inconvenient having work commitments to get back to.

### Icelandair customer review
LHR to KEF return in December 2011. The boarding process was poorly managed. The flight attendants were friendly but because food was paid for in economy it made the process so slow. Near the end of the flight there was a mad rush for the toilets. The flight back to London was a little better. It was late but I really am not sure why everything else was ready but as we being seated I saw the plane being loaded with baggage. This is a bit silly as it is proof of poor organisation skills. I would fly Icelandair again and since it is a short 3 hour flight economy is fine.

### Icelandair customer review
Man to Keflavik December 2011. First time with this airline and I was impressed with the quality of service and the good legroom in economy. Soft Drinks and beverages were free of charge however alcohol and any food had to be paid for. Headphones were also for sale but I used my own and watched a couple of movies from a reasonable selection available. When forced to wait on the tarmac at Manchester for de-icing for 3.5 hours the cabin crew made sure water soft drinks and beer were available free of charge on demand. Toilets were opened and the cabin crew were great. I would certainly fly them again for short haul at least.

### Icelandair customer review
We took flights from/to London Heathrow. The flight was good the seats quite comfortable with enough space for the legs. The service onboard was poor but we didn't expect much for a night flight. Some TV monitors didn't work at all. The landing was terrible but it was due to horrible weather conditions. Not that bad and probably the best way to travel to Iceland.

### Icelandair customer review
LHR-KEF-JFK. The fare was 30% lower than a direct LHR-JFK flight so I liked that a lot. The 757 is a great aircraft and the ride was smooth the legroom excellent my seat extremely comfortable. I had to make a fast transfer to the Keflavik-JFK flight and I agree with another reviewer that the airport makes one feel like a yo-yo up down up down and finally up. Needs work. Airline staff and crew were first-rate highly professional and a pleasure to fly with though I felt one should be able to pay cash and get change rather than using plastic for inflight purchases.

### Icelandair customer review
LHR to KEF return. Clean comfortable 757 in both directions with pleasant cabin crew. I don't mind paying for a snack inflight but Icelandair could try harder with what's on offer! Late going out due to excessive traffic both in and out of LHR and return due to late arrival of incoming aircraft but time was made up by 20/30 minutes in both directions. The only problems were with unhelpful (KEF) and rude (LHR) ground staff. What a pity.

### Icelandair customer review
SEA-KEF-LHR and back. B757 planes and carry-on restrictions make loading and unloading faster and way more efficient than much larger planes other carriers fly. Legroom in Economy was good. The inflight staff on our flights were courteous and helpful. We appreciated that alcohol was not freely available. The only problem we had was that the video screen in one of our seats on the KEF-SEA flight did not work and the window shade was broken and would not close. The flight attendants helped us find an alternative seat.

### Icelandair customer review
MAN-KEF-SEA return. From a negative point of view the carry on baggage is very restrictive (just 6kg) you have to pay for inflight meals and you also have to pay for headphones for the in flight entertainment. You can get round this last part by bringing your own on the flight. However the airline is clean and has real character. You are given pillows with Icelandic lullabies written on them and the headrests all have Icelandic proverbs on them. The crew are helpful and friendly and ground crew at KEF airport were genuinely cheerful and helpful.

### Icelandair customer review
Stockholm to New York. The tickets were more expensive comparing to other airlines. We started boarding 35 mins after the scheduled departure time. We had to pay for basic meal on the 3.5hr flight from Stockholm to Reykjavik and on 5.5 hour flight from Reykjavik to New York. The flights were not pleasant with the staff too slow and busy all the time with processing payments for the services. I fly to Europe every year for a vacation and have never experienced the payment for basic meal.

### Icelandair customer review
I travelled from SEA-KEF-FRA return. I was very disappointed not receiving any food on an overseas flight. My suitcase arrived in SeaTac dripping wet. It was raining in Iceland hard when I changed planes and I have a feeling our luggage was left in the rain without any protection.

### Icelandair customer review
HEL-YYZ. Paid about 700 euros for the roundtrip. I'd rate the cabin crew ok but not comparable to other competitors. I'm using this airline simply for the shorter flying time 4 hrs + 5.5 hrs total and less chance of losing my luggage since Reykjavik airport is typically not congested with transit passengers. Seats are ok (I'm petite) and everyone has their own TV screen. Food and headphones are extra. I'd recommend this airline to travellers who want the shortest possible route to North America from Europe/Scandinavia.

### Icelandair customer review
SEA-KEF-LHR in Economy Comfort. Reserved seats would change from week to week and even though we had a reservation for 2 people we ended up being assigned seats in adjacent rows. Seattle check-in was a breeze and the use of the BA lounge pleasant. Note that the lounge only offers packaged snacks but plenty of drinks. Our flight left 35 mins late due to some Exit sign bulbs that needed replacing on the aircraft but announcements were frequent and useful. Crews were friendly and smiling and worked it out with other passengers who also wanted to sit together and were still in Saga Class seats. The seats were comfortable although the pitch was a meagre 33". A/V system was adequate and meals were fine. Arrived Keflavik only 10 mins late. We had to go through Security Screening then Passport Control into Iceland then 3 mins later Passport Control out of Iceland. KEF-LHR also a decent flight same seat jockeying and a Turkey Sandwich for breakfast is an odd choice (but it was quite tasty). Due to air traffic control we landed at Heathrow 35 mins late. Terminal 1 is a labyrinth of dreary corridors and Passport Control lines were slow-moving. Staff were pleasant and by the time we got to Baggage Claim our bags were there.

### Icelandair customer review
Wife and I flew roundtrip from Seattle to Frankfurt. Ticket price was attractive. Flight attendants were fine from Seattle to Reykjavik. From there on and on return trip they were distant impatient and too busy to care about requests for water pillows or blankets. Asked one male attendant for water he told me to wait until service starts in 15 mins then grudgingly gave me a cup of water because I insisted. On return flight two flight attendants told me to "wait a minute" before hearing my requests but never returned to hear them. Seats were tight bottom cushion thin and hard - had to use pillows for cushion. Flights were delayed as a rule. Reykjavik airport arrival customs setup etc are a nightmare especially when our flight arrived late and we just made connecting flight on last call. This was our first and last trip using Icelandair.

### Icelandair customer review
BOS-KEF-ARN return SVG-KEF-BOS. These 4 flights were without a doubt the most uncomfortable I have experienced. A tall person sitting in Economy Class does not know where to put his legs. I developed leg cramps on both transatlantic flights. You have to pay for food and drink and order from a very limited menu. The IFE system was not working properly. No games outdated movies. The only thing that seemed to work were the commercials for tour operators around Iceland. The IFE would shut off completely at times. The flight attendants were not rude but seemed rather cold and exuded an air of superiority. First experience with Icelandair and definitely my last.

### Icelandair customer review
My family went on a cruise from Stockholm. Flights from Los Angeles-Seattle Seattle-Reykjavik no problem Reykjavik to Stockholm had big problems 30 mins after boarding they came onto the speaker saying we all need to get our stuff and get off the plane we do not have a flight crew for today. No one knew where to get our luggage how to rebook or when the next flight was. 3.5 hrs later we had our luggage and a new flight the next day. After arriving at hotel we found out we would have to pay for the hotel. This is extremely poor service considering the price we paid for our tickets.

### Icelandair customer review
Booked Economy Comfort Dulles to Heathrow for a very good price. For that we got Business Class boarding check-in free bag check entertainment system beer/wine/champagne meals snacks and access to Business Class lounges at all airports. They bump you forward as Economy seats oversell so two of four legs got bumped up to Saga class seats though Economy Comfort seats were fine. No elbows in your ribs like regular Economy. Generous leg room. Flights all arrived within 15 mins of schedule service attentive and mostly happy. Entertainment system was problematic outbound fine on return. Boarding in Iceland was a bit chaotic and uncontrolled.

### Icelandair customer review
Sweden to Washington DC return. Tickets were cheap however you don't get any food during the flight everything has to be paid for. On my return our flight was cancelled due to technical difficulties. Things were chaotic and there didn't seem to be a plan to deal with this. I was forced to stay for 48 hours extra at a hotel. The support were not located at the Dulles airport so they couldn't help me with my hotel accommodation. They only had one flight out from Dulles each day so their local personal arrived around 3pm. Yes it's cheap but if something goes wrong expect to have some extra trouble. I have now learnt that there is a big advantage of travelling with a big airline or at least airlines that have more than one flight each day at the specific airport.

### Icelandair customer review
Our tickets were very expensive for the service we received. For four hundred pounds per ticket for the 2.5 hour flight from London Heathrow-Reykjavik I expect a free meal drinks and a working entertainment system as well as a more generous checked bag allowance. Inflight entertainment didn't work on my monitor despite multiple re- starts. There was nothing to distinguish Icelandair from a more budget competitor. Keflavik airport is beautiful but badly designed - you check-in on the ground-floor go through security on the second floor duty free on the second floor passport control down to the ground floor queue at the gate on the ground floor and then go to the second floor to board.

Halifax to Reykjavik to Paris return. Meals were good quality and I was able to get an empty row. Service was extremely friendly and helpful. This airline is great for those who need to save money but still want a pleasant voyage.

### Icelandair customer review
Minneapolis to Manchester via Keflavik in Saga Class. Legroom very cramped should be advertised as Premium Economy. Menu choice not is not inspiring. Priority boarding in Minneapolis was just a scramble so why pay extra money. Disembarkation at Manchester was a total shambles with the gate agent insisting that Glasgow bound passengers disembark first for a security check. She was shouting causing lot of pushing and shoving between the airbridge and aircraft. Even the flight attendant looked shocked.

### Icelandair customer review
Flew Toronto to Manchester via Keflavik. Staff were friendly and leg room was adequate in Economy Class. I didn't like the lack of free food on the flight from Toronto so had to sustain myself on tea and coffee. The flight from Keflavik to Manchester wasn't too pleasant with no communication or apology for the delay from staff. We started boarding 15 mins after the scheduled departure time. Icelandair does have a budget feel for a national carrier and would avoid using again.

### Icelandair customer review
Economy plus on Icelandair. We were highly disappointed with our seats service and poor attitude of most of the flight attendants. Our seats were right by the door and bathroom. I would have been better off back in Economy and saved the money.

SEA-KEF-HEL return. First leg (SEA-KEF) was okay no free food provided luckily brought my own headphones but at KEF there was a strike and ended up being delayed 11 hrs. No help at the airport and another airline took me to HEL. On the return I was assured by Icelandair that another strike going on would not affect my flight. However at the airport I was re-routed from HEL-YYZ then to YVR and then to SEA. Was home 24 hrs later than scheduled.

### Icelandair customer review
5 of us flew SEA-KEF-CDG return. Our return flight out of CDG was (originally) delayed due to a problem with the plane. The passengers were given no information and told to go to a hotel at CDG where they fed us. 7 hrs later we were told to go back to the airport re-checked our bags went through security and waited there until midnight at which time we were told the flight was cancelled. Back to the hotel woke at 6.30am went back to the airport where complete chaos ensued. There was 1 Icelandair employee trying to make plans for 150 passengers to get to a variety of destinations. Anyone who wanted to leave had to run around CDG trying to find seats with other carriers. The 5 of us left France 48 hrs after our original flight on two separate carriers. Icelandair has no employees on the ground (that we saw) in Paris. They out source ticket/bag handling to a group which is ineffectual and cannot help you.

### Icelandair customer review
Icelandair to Scandinavia departing from JFK connecting in KEF for STO and then from CPH-KEF and KEF-JFK all Saga class. We took advantage of the free stopover in Iceland on our way back. I have only one complaint and that is that the departure hall in KEF crams several gates into a small area with almost no seats. Saga class is quite comfortable and the level of service was excellent. The cabin crew was friendly and attentive without being intrusive. The seats are not lie-flat and don't even recline very far but they are spacious and comfortable. The food from JFK-KEF was quite good from KEF-JFK I had the sushi which was ok. In-flight entertainment was decent although there were quite a few commercials for various Iceland tours. I wouldn't choose Icelandair for business travel it's hard to get any sleep as the flight to KEF is somewhat short and the stopover consumes time. But for leisure travel to Europe I would recommend Saga class for value-conscious travellers.

### Icelandair customer review
Seattle-London via Keflavik. Both flights on time both v full and both flights in Economy. Despite that seats were comfortable and personal TV system good. Staff pleasant and v helpful. A convenient and cost effective way between USA and UK especially if travelling one-way only.

### Icelandair customer review
The trip from JFK-KEF was uneventful other than the fact that I requested for my monitor to be reset twice to no prevail. It was our trip home from CDG that made it the worst trip ever. After everyone boarded the plane we were told to take all our belongings and get off because of some problem with the plane. We waited for 1hr to find out flight was cancelled and we needed to pick up our baggage. Only problem was no one told us which carousel to go to and of course we waited another 1hr before we saw the luggage coming out. No one from Icelandair could be found; instead they sent us to the Alyzia counter to book another flight home. We weren't given any information other than that we would have to stay the night there. After staying 24 hrs at the airport we finally booked a flight that was departing in 1hr only to find out that we weren't allowed to check in at such short notice. All in all we waited at the airport for nearly 48 hrs without anyone ever giving us any information.

### Icelandair customer review
SEA-KEF in Saga Class. We had to share the British Airways Business Lounge at the Seattle airport. Boarding was on time and the 757-200 cabin was clean. The flight attendants were warm and friendly without being intrusive. Saga class seats are not lie-flat but have a good width and recline to make the 7 hrs flight comfortable. IFE was more than adequate. Service and food were top notch. All in all an excellent flight.

### Icelandair customer review
Flew IAD-KEF-LHR in Saga class. IAD check in was ok long time to wait until somebody turned up. A sign to say what time check in would open would be great. Flights and crews fantastic friendly chatty and attentive. Food excellent and I will never hesitate to fly Icelandair again. Saga lounge in KEF is excellent and the Virgin lounge in IAD is very comfy with great staff.

### Icelandair customer review
We flew roundtrip from Seattle to Glasgow on Icelandair. We had to stop in Reykavik - (KEF) both ways. What they don't tell you is that they have no seats at the gates in this airport. Everyone stands around in a crowd. Not good if you have a bad knee. It was raining at KEF but we were unloaded down steps in the rain and walked across the cement runway getting soaked on the way. Also their care of luggage is horrible. Luggage was unloaded in the rain with no cover to help protect it on the trams. At the conveyor belt there were items falling out of the suitcases because they had opened them to check but did not fully zip the luggage closed. People complained their luggage did not show up. The attendant from Icelandair stated all luggage was done. My daughter got on the side and looked down the conveyor. She pointed out to the attendant that she could still see 10-12 suitcases down there. Only then did the attendant start the conveyor again! Thanks to my daughter a dozen people did not have to fill out forms. Also I hope you are slender because the seats are much smaller than on American carriers If you want to sit close with your sweetie you're out of luck because the arm rests do not raise like on Delta.

BOS-KEF-BOS. Overall I can't complain. It was a fairly decent experience overall. Both outbound and return flights left and arrived on time. Seats were decent. You have to buy your own food on board in the Economy cabin. Economy cabin staff were reasonably attentive. Inflight entertainment screens were available but I can't comment on them since I didn't use them much. The one bit of trouble I had was that I had flown into Terminal E at BOS on another non-codeshared airline in order to connect to my Icelandair flight. There were no Icelandair check-in kiosks in this area (behind security) and no agents so I could not check in for my Icelandair flight. I tried calling the airline phone but could not reach anyone. An agent finally showed up at the desk about an hour before boarding time. I was able to check in for the flight but because of the late time my seat assignment got mixed up. Things worked out OK though.

Flew AT-KEF via IAD. Luggage checked through to KEF. We checked in DC with the Icelandair gate agent and were told the luggage was "in the system". Now we are in Reykjavik ready to leave for 2 weeks and we still have no luggage. Does Icelandair care - no! They said when it turns up it turns up. Thanks Icelandair. And we were flying Business Class.

### Icelandair customer review
Flying SEA-London. Icelandair changed mine and my husband's seats (without notice - so instead of siting by each other for a 7 hr flight we are seated by strangers. Sort of defeats the purpose of Comfort Economy.

### Icelandair customer review
I bought a ticket to fly from Manchester to Seattle via Iceland. Less than 24 hours prior to my departure I was informed by my travel agent that my connecting flight had been rescheduled and I would have a layover in Iceland for 24 hours - if I were to stay in a hotel this was to be at my own expense. I had booked through a travel agent and she was able to reschedule me on a KLM flight instead she also secured my refund although it took 6 weeks to come through. Icelandair were unapologetic and absolved all responsibility saying it was their prerogative to reschedule the flights. I make this journey 2-3 times a years and would be reluctant to risk them again.

SEA-KEF B757-200 in Business class. Icelandair use the British Airways lounge at SeaTac. The seats onboard were wide and comfortable but are not flat bed. The flight attendants were engaging and outstanding service. The food was nice.

### Icelandair customer review
SEA-KEF-FRA return HAM-KEF-SEA. Inflight service good food for purchase the same as you get on a domestic US flight. IFE good but screen did not work correctly. Connection time in Keflavik was short but caught next flight. On the return I had a 7 hour layover had a great time at the blue Lagoon. Airport is easy to navigate and has restaurant and shops.

### Icelandair customer review
CPH-KEF-CPH B757-300. Exit seat on way out and front part of the aircraft on the way back. Not sure if this is the area for Economy Comfort if sold. Legroom very good. Outbound crew was friendly except for the Purser. Buy onboard choice is small food wise. Snacks ok. Check-in in KEF was bad as huge queues. Checked earlier with German and Icelandic staff and they confirmed that through check of luggage with LX is possible. Staff first refused and after discussing checked it through - but did not want to hand out boarding passes for further flight. Purser on the way back even worse. Yelled at people who tried to stow hand luggage but could not find any space. Rest of the crew not much better. Ran out of croissants after the 3rd row that was served on an early morning flights. No choice to Iceland (except for Iceland Express) therefore airline is mediocre.

### Icelandair customer review
OSL-KEF-JFK B 757-200's comfortable seats individual IFE screens. Movie selection quite dated games not working. Food headphones and alcoholic beverages offered for sale. FA's attentive.

### Icelandair customer review
Glasgow/Seattle return. Biggest problem was return flight. Customs/Immigration check at SEA all OK. Then changing at KEF more checks then stopping at Manchester we had to leave plane with hand - baggage and walk miles for rigorous customs checks it was at least 15 minute walk carrying hand baggage. My wife and I are in our 80s and it was exhausting for us with no offer of assistance. We will not travel with them again. Keflavik was chaos and the cabin service was poor and the staff icy - It is no loner a cheap service either.

### Icelandair customer review
I neglected to read Icelandair reviews until after I had purchased my full fare business class tickets. I decided to cancel when I called for a refund I realized why it's only a 3 star airline. After 6 phone calls and promises of immediate refund I was called a liar and told to expect a minimum of 2 months to get my refund.

### Icelandair customer review
Received email less than 3 days before flight advising delay of 8 hours meaning arrival in Iceland after midnight. Customer relations indifferent. Had to cancel as this was to be a short trip.

### Icelandair customer review
MAN-KEF-MAN Economy B757. Seat pitch reasonable and surprisingly good IFE for short haul sector. FA's pleasant and service was polite and efficient with complimentary soft and hot drinks. Checked in online ex UK with easy seat selection. Return leg not quite as problem free - inbound aircraft went tech in Toronto so offered slightly earlier flight to LHR and then onward to MAN with BA. Despite having to change terminals at LHR and transiting T5 baggage still made it to MAN.

### Icelandair customer review
BOS-KEF-ARL in economy. Flight was fine. Seats comfortable and IFE varied and good but bring your own headset as they charge. Child had a free meal on each leg of the flight but adults had to pay for food. Have to say that the quality of the inflight food is somewhat better now that you must buy it. When it was free it was inedible. Flight attendants were glacially efficient. As others have said it was mass chaos when it was time to pass through passport check and connect with our flight to Sweden. Afraid we would miss our flight but somehow they processed everyone in time to catch further flights. On the way back KEF was less chaotic and we had a couple hours to wait. Had a totally delicious Icelandic lamb sandwich at the small cafe. Will be flying them again this summer as they are the least expensive option for us.

### Icelandair customer review
I fly regularly with Icelandair usually flights are on time and checkin/boarding goes smoothly. The seats are relatively comfortable. The food used to be free - now food and drinks must be bought but drinking water is usually provided sometimes a bottle that passengers help themselves to at boarding time. At odd times in the flight (on morning flights about half an hour after takeoff just when one is about to drift off to sleep) loud advertisements touting the miracles of Iceland obviously aimed at tourists blast from the screens cannot be turned off. Flight attendants are decidedly unfriendly and seem to view passengers as an inconvenience that must be at best endured. Flights are very expensive compared to other carriers. Not recommended unless nothing else is available.

### Icelandair customer review
Saga class from LHR to Minnesota via Iceland. Takeoff was delayed from LHR and consequently the lunch offering was later than expected this causing a problem to one of us due to a dietary requirement to eat regularly. Having been advised of this the cabin crew responded with speed and concern providing an assortment of suitable snacks. Check in at LHR were less than impressive with one common queue for all classes and a surly booking clerk who appeared to view politeness and service as an inconvenience.

### Icelandair customer review
LHR-KEF-LHR : it is a shame that it feels and runs as if it was a budget airline carrier. Soft and Hot Drinks complimentary only flight tickets cheap the only positive point is you can check-in online and they still let you on with 20kg luggage. Flight on time each way and good B757 layout with good legroom - staff actually smiling this time and seemed good with customer service. Pilots gave detailed flight briefing and entertainment screens were average for a 3 hour flight.

### Icelandair customer review
SEA-KEF-SEA in Economy. Onboard seats were comfortable and pretty good leg room. IFE was on- demand and worked perfectly. You have to pay for food in Economy but considering how inexpensive the ticket was ($950 for two people round trip) and that almost all US airlines make you do the same for flights almost as long I didn't mind. Cabin crew were nice and efficient service. Return flight was the same except delay slightly longer due to weather at KEF and I was able to get an emergency exit row that had great leg room. I like that Icelandair doesn't charge you for checked baggage or exit row seating. Icelandair is better than any US airline save Hawaiian.

### Icelandair customer review
I don't ever do this but needed to let people know that this airline is a total shambles. I bought a cheaper ticket than BA - Seattle to London although I was put off by the rudeness of the customer service representative subsequently changed the day of my flight which cost me $275 (!) again a very rude customer service person. Then Icelandair cancelled my flight - no apologies for the inconvenience just a phone message saying I was eligible for a full refund. I am still 3 months later battling with them to get my money back. You send an email to the refund dept they reply 3 weeks later. There is no-one to talk to over the phone except very rude customer service people! Never again. I had my doubts when I read the reviews and now I know that this is the worst travel experience I have ever had.

### Icelandair customer review
LHR-KEF Economy. Very pleasant flight. Surprised to find IFE on a short European flight. Modern planes friendly crew excellent food available for purchase. A definite difference to the increasingly no-frills service provided by other European airlines.

### Icelandair customer review
Bought round trip from Oslo to Orlando in economy class. Booked emergency exit seats on all flights without extra cost. The plane was clean ok food and service. However flight attendants could have been more smiling. The entertainment is a bit obsolete old movies and bad selection of games.

### Icelandair customer review
We purchased the Economy Comfort seats thinking we would have a few more amenities. Our included dinner was a choice of several mediocre items - a wrap (horrible) a sandwich - all wrapped in some type of plastic wrap and thrown onto a paper table cloth put on our tray. Beer and wine were provided. Cabin attendants were busy with the economy class and very seldom seen. From MSP to Iceland the seats were fine 2x2 personal monitor comfortable seats. From Iceland to Germany our seats were 3x3 monitors were not in good places for us to see no computer connection as promised and seats similar to economy. For the additional cost of Economy Comfort I expected more.

### Icelandair customer review
Brussels to Reykjavik Saga Class: great seats food attentive and friendly service good supply of drinks full AVOD and a very interesting Icelandic modern music channel. No internet check-in no lounge or fast track in Brussels and overcrowded lounge in Reykjavik. Considering the price paid still a great value.

### Icelandair customer review
MAN-KEF-YHZ return business class. Very good value for money the experience was good excellent food aircraft were clean and service was extremely efficient. My area for criticism was no lounge in Halifax and the seats did not recline much nor did they have an adjustable foot rest.

### Icelandair customer review
Economy Comfort Class Toronto-Reykjavik-Helsinki return. A mixed experience flying Icelandair but generally great and decent value for money. Crew were professional and courteous on all flights aircraft clean and modern and flights on time. One of the perks of booking Economy Comfort Class is often the ability to reserve seats in the Saga Class cabin - ie business class seats for economy prices. I was sat in these seats on all 4 sectors which made for a relaxing and comfortable journey. Icelandair seems to oversell economy pushing these passengers into the Economy Comfort cabin and the Economy Comfort passengers moved to the rear of business class. Other benefits were priority check-in - a huge bonus in Reykjavik where as a previous report states early morning is total chaos in the check-in area. Saga lounge was good and a welcome place to spend transit time. One negative is the onboard service. They promise meal service on all flights but the reality is you get a free sandwich or snack from the buy onboard economy offering as they pass through to serve economy - not really as advertised. I found Keflavik airport to be excellent. Good shops and restaurants and a pleasant place to spend time in although seating is at a premium.

### Icelandair customer review
Dreadful experience. flight Amsterdam to New York and back with 2 kids. Service was non- existent cabin crew rude. Airport in Iceland worst ever particularly the people working there. What is wrong with this place are they aware we are in the 21st century?

### Icelandair customer review
The worst aspect about Icelandair is the check in area in KEF. I queued for 90 mins before I reached the two ladies serving all the flights leaving at 0700-0800. Amusingly the number of agents decreased the closer I got to the front of the queue. I finally saw an agent 25 mins before departure time. Then you need to run and run to reach the flight. The best thing that happened was my luggage made it to LHR. The crew onboard were rarely friendly and needed to collect money for the food and drinks. IFE was good take your own headset. Take your own food so you are not tempted to buy anything. I was impressed to see that they moved pax with infants to give them an extra seat for the baby.

### Icelandair customer review
KEF-MXP. Aircraft clean with standard legroom 32". Flight ok but without any word from cockpit. IFE acceptable free light drinks but no food - for a flight of 4 hours is a bit out of common even because we paid 540 Euro. Some crew very polite others very rude. We arrived at check in 90 mins before the time of departure : only four and in some moments three counters for a flight of 200 persons. We had no time to drink a coffee due to the queue at check in! Who voted Keflavik the best airport for 2009 as they published?

### Icelandair customer review
LHR to Toronto Pearson. My husband and children are British Citizens and I hold Egyptian Nationality but have permanent residency in the UK. Check in was fine and the lounge was adequate though inferior to others at Heathrow. Transiting in Keflavik we went to get our boarding passes to be told that I could not go through to the transit lounge as I did not have a schengen visa. This information is not on any Icelandair website and contravenes EU regulations by prohibiting my travel through Europe with my EU spouse. After repeating that I had no intention of exiting into Iceland and only intended to transit through I was then escorted to the desk to be given my boarding pass and then denied access to the lounge with my family. We stayed together and were very glad to leave such a rude and condescending place. We had non refundable tickets but gladly binned them so as not to be treated like that again. They really need to learn about nationality requirements before putting people through that kind of stress.

### Icelandair customer review
We enjoyed our flight on Icelandair. Six of us traveling to Norway through London from Minneapolis had an enjoyable flight - food was different but that is all part of the travel experience. The shorter flight segments and ability to select flight days and times at the website by cost was easy and appreciated. The attendants were nice but not the most friendly. We had no problems getting our luggage to go all the way to Norway even with the change of carriers in London.

### Icelandair customer review
OSL-KEF-BOS return in economy. All legs on B757 and more or less on time. Planes were ok but seats somewhat uncomfortable. Only non-alcoholic drinks are complimentary the rest has to be paid for. Never tried any of the food as we brought our own. On-demand IFE but limited choice and not updated monthly. The cabin crew seemed to either be very friendly or very surly. I wouldn't say Icelandair is good value for money but they provide the quickest service between Northern Europe and North America.

### Icelandair customer review
SEA-KEF at the beginning of June and KEF-LHR on B757. Both flights were on time. Cabins were spotless and service friendly. It was a pleasant experience.

### Icelandair customer review
LHR-JFK business Class with stop in Iceland. Checkin no waiting and Servisair Lounge in Terminal 1 comfortable. Seating is equivalent to domestic US first class or Premium Economy. IFE adequate but only about 9 movies to choose from and most were not current. Power socket at each seat. Food and wine for very good and I enjoyed the unusual selection of fresh sushi on the 2nd leg to JFK. Service friendly but not fawning. Best part of the flight was seeing our bags come off first with the Saga tags in place all ready for Customs. Lounge in Iceland was excellent but didn't have much time due to having to go through immigration just for the transfer). Price was nearly half what Air France and British were charging for Premium Economy.

### Icelandair customer review
New York to London via Reykjavik roundtrip (stopping in Reykjavik for 3 days on the way there). Friendly staff fluent. Very competitive prices as the same flight on a US airline was $400 more - without a stop in Iceland. Cannot complain about paying for food on flights as the flight was cheap but it did look better than most airline food I've seen. Would definitely recommend flying transatlantic with them and stopping in Iceland.

### Icelandair customer review
ARN-KEF-YYZ Saga class. Stockholm to Reyjavik leg very basic with little IFE and semi- attentive staff despite the fact the business class section was almost empty. Reykjavik- Toronto leg was better with a better plane (newer interior) better staff and food. Stopover in Reykjavik was easy - it is a good small airport and a better option than Heathrow or Frankfurt for transfers. Icelandair is charming and good value for the money but is inferior to larger European carriers on transatlantic routes.

### Icelandair customer review
Amsterdam-Boston return. The airline is okay seating is good. Soft drinks free meals and food are charged at extra costs onboard but we took sandwiches with us. There is one important thing; when surfing on the internet looking and comparing prices on the Icelandair website rose each time with about 25 to 100 Euros when coming back to the site. In the end prices had risen by about 500 Euros. Then we made the final booking on a friends laptop and the initial low prices came back again which means that they recognize the computer you work on and adapt in this case increase prices each time you come back. So when comparing and searching work on computers with different internet addresses!

### Icelandair customer review
Would advise that you never fly Icelandair out of Minneapolis on a Friday or Saturday (Sundays probably not good either). They don't have staff on site on these days so if you should miss your plane (as we did due to weather) there is no one who can rebook it for you. They have flights operating but use staff from another airline (Sun Country) to run them. These non- Icelandair staff are not authorized to rebook flights. We could find no one capable of rebooking us on the next flight - called the Icelandair 800 number etc as well as Orbitz who initially booked our flight - no one could help us because they weren't authorized to rebook. Only Icelandair in Minneapolis could do that and they're not around on weekends.

### Icelandair customer review
Flight cancelled resulting in a 26 hour delay on May 31. This was not volcano related. I never did get a clear answer on why the flight was delayed. All questions were stonewalled and we were treated like they were doing us a favor by getting us to our destination at all. I am still waiting an email response from their customer service because they have stopped taking calls.

### Icelandair customer review
We have just returned from a trip to London via Icelandair. The price could not be beaten booking was a breeze. There are luggage restrictions but unlike American Airlines where passengers have a tendency to bring huge bags on board (which take forever to stow) and there is no room left don't look to the surly cabin crew for help. Our seats were comfortable. The cabin staff are to be commended for their professionalism. Food is not included we did try the sushi and it was better than most Tandoori Chicken was pretty bad.

### Icelandair customer review
Just finished a roundtrip Helsinki to Toronto via Reykjavik on Icelandair. The fare was booked in February and very competitive at 500EUR. Reykjavik airport is very convenient for transfer and for someone who does not enjoy long flights it was wonderful to only have a 5-hour transatlantic sector. Cabin crew very senior and just polite not friendly at all. The worst part is the buy-on-board menu which really should include more choice in warm meals. A tasteless vegetarian wrap just is not sufficient. Best to bring own snacks. For the fare paid Icelandair got me there safely and almost on schedule. Still wish they'd make passengers feel more welcome with a few smiles thrown in.

### Icelandair customer review
The term "economy plus" is a misnomer. Economy minus would be a better description. First the seats were the same as economy except the middle seat in a three-seat was left vacant. We had to share our tv screen as only one was provided on the seats assigned. My wife and I took turns being uncomfortable in the seat that had our knees up against the protruding exit door. As poor and uncomfortable was the seating it was not as bad as the poor guy in front of us whose seat did not recline at all. In addition he and the other passenger had no middle seat between them. As much as we would like to visit Iceland for a longer period next year I'm afraid Icelandair is out of the question. The cabin crew needs to spend less time catching up on the latest news they have to share and pay more attention to those that maintain their employment. The is the first negative review I have written over the past few years in my travels. I generally write very positive things or choose not to write anything. This experience compelled me to make this exception.

### Icelandair customer review
I found Icelandair service absolutely inadequate. I have never had to pay for food on an intercontinental flight. Icelandair does not have a contract with other airlines therefor they will not transfer luggage from other airlines. So you have to go to baggage claim and pick up your luggage and recheck in with Icelandair. I could live with all of the above if the pricing was so much cheaper than other airlines. But that too is a major disappointment.

### Icelandair customer review
SEA-KEF-LHR. Check-in & boarding at SEA was good. Very impressed with onboard service and found it interesting that very few pax actually opted to take advantage of the on-board meal purchase which enforces my belief that most pax only eat airline meals because they feel they have paid for it so they should eat whatever is offered. Found the customs / immigration at KEF to be friendly and welcoming which was not the case with the security people at KEF who were anything but friendly and welcoming and quite aggressive with pax. Departure of flight from KEF was on-time as was arrival at LHR with luggage waiting on the carousel. LHR-KEF-SEA check-in and boarding and well organized with friendly staff who went out of their way to solve problems with my seating assignment. Overall impression of Icelandair was very good - they will get more of my business if they continue to offer great fares. Highly recommend Icelandair for anyone looking for good value and those who like me who find the nonstop flights from the west coast of Canada/USA too long and like the thought of having a break after seven hours of flying.
