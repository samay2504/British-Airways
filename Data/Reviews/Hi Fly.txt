### “an unprofessional and indifferent attitude”
Iberia sold me a flight, on which I was supposed to operate with its equipment, but 24 hours before, it changed it to the airline Hi Fly. I purchased my ticket with Iberia, with the expectation of receiving certain specific services and amenities, which were not provided due to a change of aircraft. Not only did this change represent a decrease in the quality of the service I paid for, but it was also made without prior notice or options for compensation. Furthermore, I am concerned to note that these types of modifications appear to disproportionately affect flights to Latin America, giving the impression that passengers on these routes are treated less than those in other regions. As an Iberia customer, I consider it unacceptable that this type of differentiation is established that makes us feel like second-class passengers. To compound the situation, the staff on board displayed an unprofessional and indifferent attitude towards passengers' concerns, which only contributed to an even more unsatisfactory experience. Iberia me vendió un vuelo, en el que se suponia operaba con sus equipos, pero 24 horas antes, me lo cambió por la aerolinea Hi Fly, Compré mi boleto con Iberia, con la expectativa de recibir ciertos servicios y comodidades específicos, los cuales no fueron proporcionados debido a un cambio de aeronave. Este cambio no solo representó una disminución en la calidad del servicio por el que pagué, sino que también fue realizado sin previo aviso ni opciones de compensación. Además, me preocupa notar que este tipo de modificaciones parecen afectar de manera desproporcionada a los vuelos con destino a Latinoamérica, lo que da la impresión de que los pasajeros de estas rutas reciben un trato inferior al de otras regiones. Como cliente de Iberia, considero inaceptable que se establezca este tipo de diferenciación que nos hace sentir como pasajeros de segunda categoría. Para agravar la situación, el personal a bordo mostró una actitud poco profesional e indiferente ante las inquietudes de los pasajeros, lo que solo contribuyó a una experiencia aún más insatisfactoria.

### "not a pleasant experience"
Not Verified |  I recently traveled with Hifly on a flight from Dubai (DXB) to Algiers (ALG), and it was not a pleasant experience. The seating was not comfortable, which made the journey difficult. The cabin crew appeared unfriendly and unapproachable, and they did not smile, which left a negative impression. I believe customer service and passenger comfort are critical aspects of air travel, and I hope my feedback will help in improving the quality of service.

### “the service quality was pathetic”
Not Verified | Happened to take this flight from Nairobi yesterday KQ310 and the service quality was pathetic. One of the wash room was not functioning throughout (in a fully loaded flight). Overall the flight was not clean. The food was below par than expected. The crew seems very unprofessional and a bit rude too. ( one of the crew was a bit rude to my friend on seat 18…

### "Never flying them again"
Never written an airline review before, but worst airline ever. Deceptive practices!! Was forced to pay a $15 "check-in" fee even though there's absolutely no notice whatsoever that this would be necessary if I had not checked in online already. Not only did I have to pay $15 fee, but they did not even have the means to accept card. I had to scan a few our code, fill out a form on the website, and enter my card information. AND they do not even accept all common cards. I needed to use another card before it went through. Then, I was told I wouldn't be allowed to board if I had a carry-on overage. Yeah? You've already checked in my luggage. You going to fly my luggage without me on the plane or de-board the entire craft? Never flying them again.

### "food and staff were awful"
Air Mauritius used this airline as a substitute. Should of flown out at 21.05 but took off at 22.00 no explanation for the delay. We checked in and given seats but at boarding gate we were told that we had to change seats because the monitors were not working so we couldn’t sit together or 50% off a return flight to Mauritius. If we had known how rubbish the in flight entertainment was we would have taken 50% off. The entertainment was awful it was a selection of 4 videos which all started at the same time. No option of what they were and if you missed the start tough. The food and staff were awful. The staff were grumpy and only one had a smile. The food and drink was terrible. We got offered one cup of cold tea and a very small cold drink on a 12hour flight. Finally the toilet had run out of water in the sink so you couldn’t wash your hands. I can honestly say this is the worst flight I have ever experienced.

### "would never fly this airline again"
Not Verified |  Was forced to fly HiFly because my Aer Lingus flight crew was sick. I would never fly this airline again. First they couldn’t even have an orderly boarding process. The seats are absolutely horrible. No entertainment at all and this was a 7 hour flight. The seats are so close together and extremely uncomfortable. When they finally gave us our meal they didn’t take the garbage away for an hour and a half. They never answered a call button form a passenger and they didn’t have any air on until someone complained. There is no individual air for each seat. Would rather wait another week to get home than fly this airline again

### "glad I got to experience Hifly"
Montego Bay to Toronto. I was originally supposed to fly with Air Transat. However, when a white aircraft pulled up with no airline indication on it, I became quite worried as this has never happened to me before. The flight was delayed about 30 minutes so I assumed that loading the aircraft, fuelling and boarding would take a while - which would add to the delay. This was not the case though. In all honestly, it was the quickest boarding I have ever experienced. It was done in about 15 minutes. The captain announced the route he was taking, and said he would try to make up for lost time. The flight was originally supposed to take 4hrs and 5min but ended up being 3hrs and 25min! The cabin crew were the best I’ve ever experienced. They were smiling, happy to assist, and even made conversation. It’s quite the contrary on some other flights I’ve experienced. The aircraft itself is older, a bit outdated but nothing to cry home about. They were also extremely spacious, which was amazing! The food was the same as Air Transat, as they were operating for them on their behalf. There was no entertainment but that was alright because the flight was only a few hours along and was in the middle of the night so most people were sleeping anyway. I’m glad I got to experience Hifly.

### "very favorably impressed with this airline"
Not Verified |  Orlando to London Gatwick. Flight was booked for Norwegian. We learned shortly before flight that we would be actually flying with HiFly. Did a quick internet search and did not find any alarming negatives. We were surprised to see a plain, white jet pull up to the terminal. We were informed that the flight would be minimally delayed by the crew. The boarding process was as smooth as rude, impatient customers would allow - the crew handled it well. The flight attendants were young, fresh, energetic, efficient and very nice - a nice change for us. The flight crew/captain informed us right away about the flight route, that we were navigating around a storm, that he apologized for the initial delay, but that he believed we could make up the time. He did just that. The seats and food were what we expected in economy class - so no real complaints there, as I choose not to pay for upgrades. All in all, very favorably impressed with this airline.

### "cabin crew made no attempt to organise anything"
We returned from Holguin on flight 5K2817 run by Hi-Fly. This company was drafted in to replace the original Thomas Cook flight (MT2817). The flight was due to take off at 17.00 but we didn’t start boarding until nearly 17.00. Like most people, we didn’t rush as we had boarding passes with allocated seat numbers. Some people had also paid more for extra leg room seats. As we boarded the plane the cabin crew told us to just sit anywhere! This led to chaos and contributed to the delays in taking off. A storm then rolled in and at 17.55 the captain confirmed that we wouldn’t be taking off. There was no further information until 18.39 when he announced that there a was sick child on board and asked for assistance. At 19.08 a Thomas Cook/Condor plane landed in the storm. At 19.31 the captain announced that the child and parents would be leaving the plane but it wasn’t until 19.58 that the baggage belt arrived to start removing the bags. At 20.46 the captain announced that we would finally be leaving. At 20.50 the Thomas Cook plane took off – ahead of us! At 21.21 we finally took off – 4.5 hours after boarding. The cabin crew made no attempt to organise anything – not even the seating. We heard of several fights breaking out and there could well have been many more. The seats were cramped and there was no leg room. The selfish person in front of me pushed their seat back resulting in absolutely no leg room at all. My knees were crushed against the back of their seat for over 8 hours. There is no way I could have placed myself into the brace position (see image). I pointed this out to the cabin crew who, as usual, couldn’t care less. There was no entertainment at all and the only food offered was a roll with very little inside it. The only drink offered by the crew was water, however, we discovered 6 hours into the flight that hot drinks were available near the back. None of the crew bothered to tell us and we had to get up and get it ourselves This is without doubt the worst flight were have ever had to endure. The whole experience had left us reluctant to fly again. Hi-Fly should not be used as a replacement service again – they simply aren’t up to the standards required for even basic air travel. Their planes are cramped, under-equipped and the staff are either undertrained or just couldn’t give a damn.

### "Flight plastic free"
Lisbon to Salvador Bahia. Flight plastic free. The first one I have travelled with. And they had Ipads to comfortable watch what we preferred. The distance between the chairs was large.

### "a very good experience"
Salvador to Lisbon. Everything great. The flight was on time and the flight attendants were super nice. Good food and served in nice quantities. The entertainment was very personalized. It was a very good experience.

### "Very nice flight"
Not Verified |  Lisbon to Salvador. Very nice flight. Staff, food and seats were very nice. Entertainment was great with several movies and series to choose from. I will definitely be travelling again with HiFly.

### "well trained and professional staff"
Not Verified |  Amsterdam to New York. I flew Hi Fly on a Norwegian flight. An older jet, the interior was outdated a bit. The overhead reading lights could only be turned on from the crew. One of the bathroom sinks wasn’t working. There were only about 6 movies and 2 tv shows to be entertained from, but if you are flying 8 hours, you should know to bring some sort of entertainment with you. Seats were cloth, not leather if that matters. The crew more than made up for any shortcomings. I felt like they had a full crew of well trained and professional staff. But they were pleasant, smiled, and made sure our drinks were taken care of since we also bought meals. They were likely one of the best crews that I have ever flown with. I fly about 30 times per year. All in all, sure it wasn’t a Boeing 787 but they got us where we were going.

### "wouldn't choose to fly with hifly"
Not Verified |  Hi Fly operated the route Brunei - Melbourne on behalf of Royal Brunei, due to RB having some sort of issue with their usual fleet for that route. We were told this at Heathrow (full flight was London- Melbourne via Dubai & Brunei). It stated the flight would be as comfortable, and the same high standard as RB. Not the case, sadly! Plane was older, more cramped and I felt not very clean. In-flight entertainment consisted of about 6 or 7 films, and 2 TV shows. I was lucky to have a vacant seat next to me, but the screen want working; I asked the flight attendant to see if it could be reset, and I doubt she even checked, as it never worked and no-one came back to me to update. Food service was incredibly slow, with warm drinks and nothing explained. I had to ask for my water bottle to be refilled 3 times (over 1 hour!) and finally, to get it refilled, I had to use the call attendant button, as the lady who insisted she hasn't forgotten, clearly had! Also, loads of passengers had to ask about the seatbelt sign, as it was on after take-off for a very long time (smooth flying so no need) and we weren't able to use the toilets. The sign went on again after a period of short turbulence, however again took a long time to go off, so people were just disregarding it to use the toilet (no cabin crew in sight at this time) Upon arrival, it was a brief message of thank you, but no local time update - something which is necessary upon arrival in a new time zone! All in all, a shame to have had this flight as a last leg of a long haul - you need to be comfortable. They were no way near up to RB's standard or service. I wouldn't choose to fly with hi fly, and I'd be hesitant if I knew they were stepping in as a replacement service provider

### "Hi-Fly filled in quite nicely"
We were booked on Air Transat flight TS178 from Montreal to Porto. The first leg was from Toronto to Montreal. Upon landing on the 15th of September at Montreal for our connecting flight a few hours later, we were informed that it had been cancelled. I later found out through a friend that it was due to a technical issue with the A310 we were supposed to fly. We were rescheduled for departure on the 16th at 4 PM. Upon arrival we found out the plane was delayed again and that we would have to wait until 8:50 PM for departure. Transat never advised us it was Hi-Fly, just that it was an A340-300 we would be flying. Wasn't hard to put two and two together however. Upon boarding the plane (1st class as we were booked on club) I was pleased to see it was quite clean and the attendants were polite and friendly. The pilot was also very polite and was in the cabin speaking with the passengers before departure. Before takeoff we were advised that there would be some light to moderate turbulence a few hours into the flight (which proved accurate as meal service was stopped) but nothing that we weren't prepared for. About an hour or so in they began dinner service. Selection was limited so we had the risotto. It was actually decent but the croissant was bit dry. The full recline of the seats was nice however I had to switch with my Fiancee as hers didn't work and I'm too nervous a person to fully recline anyways. Still a comfortable enough seat and as it was a former Emirates first class cabin, the space was incredible. The breakfast was far more fresh and quite good. Focaccia, croissant and mixed fruit which were served about an hour before landing. Landing was so smooth you couldn't even feel the initial touchdown, nor the front wheel touchdown. The A340-300 is a nice smooth plane and our pilot made it that much smoother. All in all it was an excellent experience. Air Transat was very accommodating and Hi-Fly filled in quite nicely.

### "a very good experience"
Not Verified |  Gatwick to New York. I had a ticket with Norwegian and I got a series of SMSs telling me that the company that will actually fly the plane was Hi-Fly, that there will be only limited entertainment, etc. I read reviews on this site before and was worried about this flight. I was in for a surprise. The A380 was super, clean and in very good shape, the food was very good, drinks offered, the staff was attentive, nice, smiling and welcoming. What passes for limited entertainment these days is that they offered only 16 movies on the screen in front of you and you had to bring your own headphones. It was a very good experience, in fact, one of the best in some time on a regular airline. Here is a photo of the plane as we were boarding.

### "This company is a disgrace"
Not Verified |  Due to a technical problem on our Thomas Cook flight we were delayed 24 hours and had to fly with HiFly. We paid for premium economy but were placed in economy next to the only toilet working on the flight. This was a bone of contention because other people were allocated our P.E seats. There were no alcoholic drinks available and by the time they got to us the food had run out so we went hungry. No entertainment available, it was pathetic. My wifes headrest fell off and when I reported this the crew member shrugged his shoulders and done nothing about it. The crew who were from Portugal were ignorant and rude. The aircraft was fithy and as described before only one working toilet. This company is a disgrace and the aircraft should not have been allowed off the ground.

### "Never use this airline"
HiFly operated this Air New Zealand flight due to mechanical issues. We were unable to complete seat select and were given middle row seats. There was limited room with uncomfortable seating. Flight was an overnight flight. There were no pillows nor blankets offered. The plane was dirty inside with the toilets dirty from the beginning of the flight, the containers were not refilled nor supplies restocked. The staff were surly and passengers were made to feel like everything was an imposition. The inflight entertainment was limited but at least it worked, this is the only reason my rating is a 3 and not a 2. A breakfast choice was pancakes, this was two cold pancakes that were dry and tasteless, accompanied by a cold and bitter coffee. When I asked for a hot coffee there was no response, before it was taken from me and returned with a small amount of hot water added to it. We paid a premium to fly with Air New Zealand but were a given second rate flight. Never use this airline.

### "operated my Norwegian flight"
HiFly operated my Norwegian flight from Paris CDG to Los Angeles. The premium class seats were very comfortable, however in-flight entertainment was limited and not on par with that of major carriers. Meals were very average, although the flight attendants were all polite and professional. I'd be open to flying them again only if the ticket price was substantially below that of the legacy carriers.

### "Appalling service"
Gatwick to New York. Got on the plane, taxied to the start of the runway. Had a system issue so they pulled back off the runway onto the maintenance strip. They then unload everyone onto buses and dump us at the terminal, no one has told a single thing as to what’s happening with anything, we all go through border security as we were told that our bags were going to be unloaded. Once through we couldn’t find the carousel where our bags were, turns out they weren’t going to unload the aircraft and that they were going to repair. Still no one knows anything, then we get told the flights cancelled and our baggage will be unloaded. Useless communication from them to the customer, none of the hi fly workers or Norwegian workers knew anything about anything. Lack of information within their own circle and with the customers. Appalling service.

### "poor, unfriendly service"
This flight from Manchester to Orlando was a replacement for a Thomas Cook Airlines Flight, No: MT2604. Flight departure delayed from 12.15 to actual time: 17.35 (over 5 hours late). Called to Gate at 14.35 1.5 hours prior to boarding at 16.00. We were herded into a small, overcrowded Departure Lounge with insufficient seating, suffocatingly hot. Not a single member of staff from whom information could be gleaned was present, nor was any announcement made with information or explanation for over an hour. Thomas Cook aircraft was substituted with Hi Fly. We had paid for Premium Class with allocated seats which were not available on the Hi Fly Aircraft (Our row 4 Seats (A4 and C4) were non-existent. We were told by the Flight Attendant that rows 1 to 3 were the Premium seats but when sitting in vacant seats alongside other similarly displaced passengers, were told that we were to move to the next section and choose any! I remonstrated with the staff to no avail so had to be relocated to already occupied seats therefore displacing a passenger. After boarding we sat on the aircraft for one hour and forty-five minutes before leaving the runway at 17.45. Inflight entertainment screens were not working. We were given Ipads which were collected in, without exception, far too early - three hours before the flight landed even though passengers were in the middle of films. Of the two toilets in our section, one had no flushing water. No alcoholic drinks were available when they should have been in Premium Class. Ice-cream which was offered immediately after the meal, was totally melted and required drinking. When my wife was feeling ill during the flight, I asked three times for a ‘sick-bag’ before being told that there were non-available and eventually a plastic bag was found. The statement “Our delayed customers will receive food and drinks and other assistance as required by law” was not implemented, staff were not available in the Gate area. On board, the Flight Attendants provided poor, unfriendly service. This is not an airline to be recommended.

### "Terrible experience, never again"
Los Angeles to London Gatwick. Terrible experience, never again. Originally booked with Norwegian but received text message stating our flight was being operated by Hi Fly. We had the economy plus, allowing us to check bags, seats were pre assigned and meals included. No overhead air vents and the flight was extremely warm. The seats are small. In flight entertainment was the movie Titanic. The meals were served (late) to everyone which is good for them but why did we pay extra? The beverages are warm, ice not available. If you would like to purchase additional snacks or beverages they don't offer this service. The staff is not friendly,  were speaking Portuguese the whole time. I would have never booked this airline, don't do it. I give them two stars because the pilot did a great job of us arriving safely.

### "crew professional and polite"
Lisbon to Recife with Comfortable and modern aircraft, with inflight entertainment. Cabin crew professional and polite, and were also helpful. Beverages and food on board were enough.

### "this was a great flight"
Me and my family flew Hi Fly from Lisbon to Salvador last December and it was a really nice experience. My chlidren were very happy with the ipads onboard, it was a great way to keep kids (and adults) entertained. Instead of traditional seats with TV on Hi Fly they give each passenger an Ipad, with newspapers, magazines, music, tv series and a excelent variety of movies, to return in the end of the flight. Catering was top quality for a charter flight, and crew was  very friendly and helpful. Loved their turquoise uniforms. This was a great flight!

### "inside of plane was grubby"
Cartagena, Colombia to London Gatwick on Hi Fly. We took off late because the airport did not have a fuel bowser sufficiently large to refill the plane in one go. Hence dinner was not served until three hours into the flight (after 10 pm). My pre-ordered veggie meal was not available so they reheated an already cooked but left over meal from the outbound flight (it was awful). Then lights out and off to sleep but just over one hour later we were woken up (lights on) for an inflight snack of crisps and a ham/cheese hot melt sandwich (no veggie option available so I went hungry). Lights off and then about 90 minutes later we were woken up for breakfast. It would have been better to have given us the melt asap after takeoff and let us sleep after the late dinner. The inside of the plane was grubby and the seats had not been cleaned for a long time - the seat pitch was reasonable for economy. The inflight entertainment was a multichannel loop affair but no one knew what was playing because there was no inflight guide and the crew did not know either. The cabin crew were vaguely interested in their job (one at the back was very good) but there was no real customer care. Upon landing there was a technical problem with the airbridge but the captain did explain what was happening and how they were planning on fixing it (well done him).

### Hi Fly customer review
This airline replaced our scheduled Thomas Cook flights. The aircraft cabin layout was different to the advertised Thomas Cook one so the reserved seating was no longer suitable. Luckily we were able to change. The Hi Fly crew were good but there were also some Thomas Cook crew on board which led to a disorganised feel. I think it would have been more appropriate just to let Hi Fly crew operate the flight.

### Hi Fly customer review
This flight was a replacement for a TAP flight that was cancelled the previous day. The aircraft was an and there was no inflight entertainment what so ever. The crew was young and pleasant. We enjoyed the experience.
