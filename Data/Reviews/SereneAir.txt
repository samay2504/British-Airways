### "worst experience ever"
Not Verified |  The worst experience ever, I live 150km away from airport and my flight was at 1pm but it got cancelled without any information till next day at 7:00am. When I asked the office to provide me accommodation as it is their fault and this is the least they can do, they said no.

### "they have no crew to fly!"
Originally planned for 13:00 ETD from ISB to KHI. Then changed to 18:45. Checking in was delayed from 17:00 hrs to 17:15. Though boarding gate was B1, sent to C1 and held till 18:25. Then sent to B1 boarding gates. Wheel chair passengers were sent to board at 19:10 and returned. Serene staff at boarding gates disappeared. Came back at 19:50 telling they have no crew to fly! They do not know when can they find alternative crew. As of 20:12 we are still waiting without knowing when we will fly! !

### "third class airline"
Serene Air always delayed. Specially Beijing to Islamabad this is common practice that the flight is cancelled or delayed for 8-12 hours. The same happens to me I have a flight at 9:20 from Beijing then it was delayed to 21:00, from Beijing to Islamabad. I have to move to Karachi, so I missed my flight from Islamabad to Karachi also. And all the time they tell that its operational problems. I suggest all of you that boycott this third class airline.

### “No clear updates are being provided”
My father, along with 20 other passengers, had a group ticket from Jeddah to Karachi on March 19, 2025, at 03:30 AM, but the flight was abruptly canceled. The airline provided hotel accommodation but kept rescheduling the flight multiple times—first to March 20 at 03:30 AM, then March 21 at 03:30 AM, and now to 07:40 PM. To make matters worse: There is no airline representative at the hotel to assist the stranded passengers. No transport has been arranged to take them to the airport. No clear updates are being provided about the flight status. The helpline is completely unresponsive—no one is picking up calls. This level of mismanagement and disregard for passengers is unacceptable. Sadly, this is not the first time we have faced such an issue. Last year, when traveling from Karachi to Jeddah, our flight was delayed by an entire day. Serene Air needs to seriously improve its service, communication, and reliability. This has been one of the worst airline experiences we have encountered.

### “no explanation or compensation”
I am extremely frustrated with the ongoing delays and lack of communication from Serene Air. My flight ER723 from Lahore to Dubai, originally scheduled for October 10th at 11:50 PM, was delayed until 8:00 AM on October 11th, leaving me stranded at the airport for hours without any support or compensation. Now, I'm facing another delay with the same flight scheduled for tomorrow, November 16th, and once again, there has been no explanation or compensation. This is unacceptable. I expect an immediate response and demand my ticket be rescheduled, along with compensation for the inconvenience caused by these repeated delays. If this issue is not resolved soon, I will be forced to take further action.

### "Never travel again with them"
Flight delayed for more than 2 hours, their employee was harrasing a woman knowing well that flight delayed, they told her why r u late and she was literally begging them to board. Never travel again with them, I had better experience with flyJinnah in the past.

### "really disappointing experience"
Just had a really disappointing experience on Serene Air flight ER-525 from Lahore to Karachi on May 14th. I got to the boarding gate early (around 10:58 pm for an 11:25 pm flight) but ended up getting denied boarding. Now, things happen, I get it. But what really bothered me was how the staff handled it. There were three staff members, and none of them seemed interested in even talking to me! It felt like they completely ignored me. No explanation for why I couldn't board, no attempt to help me rebook, nothing. It was like I was invisible! Super frustrating, especially since I had to scramble and book another flight on the spot (of course, at my own expense). Look, I'm not one to make a fuss, but the way they treated me was just not right. Hoping Serene Air can look into this. Maybe some communication training for the staff is in order? Anyway, just wanted to share my experience in case it helps anyone else out.

### "worst airline ever"
Not Verified |   The worst airline ever. We booked our tickets two weeks ago from Islamabad to Dubai and the flight was delayed at first for one week, and the on the day we had to travel, again the flight was delayed for 12 hours. Now we are on the airport and waiting since 4am (26 april) and it's 1PM now, they just said their aeroplane have some issues.

### "better to not travel"
Not Verified |   Still waiting 9 hours for my flight to even open check in. Always choose something other than this terrible airline. If Serene airline is your only choice, it's better to not travel.

### "long unpredictable delays"
Absolutely horrid. I've traveled in some of the worst airlines in the world. Nothing has been as consistently bad as Serene. Flights always face long unpredictable delays which are poorly communicated

### "timings are very unreliable"
Booked with Serene air specifically due to timing schedule (7pm flight) since we didn't want to reach Islamabad too late in the evening - flight was delayed 5 hours and ending up taking off after midnight. What's even worse is that our return flight (ER702) was delayed by over 4 hours as well. Its a shame since the service is decent but timings are very unreliable.

### “flight delayed by more than 2 hours”
Not Verified | Tried first time for a change to see if anything better, but like most Pakistan airlines, this was worse even, flight got delayed by more than 2 hours and most innocent reason they gave that cargo is loading so forget rest of the passengers. They don’t care...just a new carp in addition to those old PIA Airlines who has been nothing but worst.

### "such poor service and flight experience"
I'd like to raise a complaint about my recent experience. Firstly, there were no separate booths for Jeddah check-in. After searching the entire airport, I couldn't find any Jeddah check-in booth, so I went to the Riyadh check-in booth for assistance. To my surprise, they informed me that they were handling Jeddah check-in as well, but there were no clear signs or displays indicating this. To make matters worse, the flight was delayed by 1 hour and 30 minutes. In all my years of traveling, I've never encountered such poor service and flight experience.

### "Pathetic attitude of the pathetic airline service"
I booked the flight 15 days before departure to make sure I get an acceptable price and I will be able to celebrate the very first birthday of my daughter. I received phone call only 3 days before the departure date from a very unprofessional representative of this airline that your flight will be rescheduled to 16 days later! No apology, no nothing. Just plain words that if you don't want to, you can refund the amount. Pathetic attitude of the pathetic airline service. Never gonna trust any airline service coming from this 3rd world country.

### "attitude with passengers is shockingly bad"
Not Verified |  No advance facility of seat reservation and meal selection. Seat selection is one of the essential features that ease out the travel. Flight is delayed by 3 hrs. In flight crew attitude with passengers is shockingly bad. Not likely to travel again on such airline.

### "truly terrible experience"
I recently had a truly terrible experience with them from Islamabad to Riyadh on June 17, 2023. From start to finish, it was filled with disaster and discomfort. The ordeal began with an unannounced 8-hour delay, during which the airline provided no facilities or support for the passengers. I tried visiting their office and calling the helpline to understand the reason for the delay, but I was met with indifference and blame, as if I should have known about it in advance. To add to the confusion, when I checked the official website for updates, it indicated that the flight was on time. However, the flight did not appear on the airport screens for several hours. Finally, it reappeared on the screen with misleading information that the delay was only one hour. Throughout this entire ordeal, passengers, including families with children, were left scattered in the airport, feeling helpless and hopeless. There were no refreshments, meals, or any facilities provided. It was a time of extreme inconvenience and trouble. When we approached the airline team at the boarding counter for confirmation, their response was so bad. They informed us that the aircraft was currently loading passengers in Dubai and that the flight's departure time would only be confirmed upon its arrival at Islamabad airport. This lack of clarity and professionalism caused further frustration. Eventually, the flight was delayed for another hour. Despite the numerous challenges faced during the journey, the flight attendants stood out for their attentive and helpful approach. This small act of responsiveness was truly commendable amidst an otherwise disappointing journey" Based on my experience, I will never fly with this airline. Even if it were the only option available, I would opt for an alternative.

### "Decent experience overall"
I got this airline at last moment during checkin at ISB when my ticket of AirAsia found out to be invalid. Decent experience overall. Leg room was surprisingly less than airblue.

### "I'm still waiting for my refund"
Unfortunately chose to make a reservation on Serene for DXB-LHE-DXB dated June 11th for return trip to cherish moments on Eid in town, But, Serene expert side of the things made it worse experience to explore. Payment was successfully charged from my card but airline booking status can't be changed from reservation to issued ticket due to technical error on the part of Serene Air. Initially blame game started by call center that check your bank, later after useless week airline accepted that payment has been claimed by us but we can't validate your respective booking as confirmed. Airline's Dubai office promised that they would refund my payment in cash in two days time, but till now as of June 21st there is nothing. Almost two weeks and I'm still waiting for my refund.

### "14 days later still no refund"
Flight was cancelled on 26 April by the airline. I am entitled to a full refund. I paid by Credit Card, 14 days later still no refund. Automated standard replies from Customer services, No names of employees and they do not answer the phone. Never book a flight in Pakistan using a credit card, always go to the airport and see which flights are flying that day and pay in cash.

### "already delayed 2 hours!"
First time I am travelling with SereneAir and it’s already delayed 2 hours! I got a text message this morning saying it’s 15 minutes delayed then when we arrived airport, we found out that actually this flight is delayed 2 hours. Very disappointed.

### "No one was wearing their mask"
Our trip was uncomfortable as there was no spacing in between the seats. No one was wearing their mask and there was no social distancing. I would never recommend this flight. This was the worst flight we ever had.

### "Overall, pleasant experience"
Islamabad to Karachi. I was travelling with this airline with the gap of about 2 years. Aircraft was clean, staff was helpful and the flight was punctual. Snacks were served and they were fine. Overall, pleasant experience.

### "experience has been good"
Karachi to Quetta. Had been travelling by SereneAir for over 2 years and the experience has been good. This time as well. Flight was on time. Breakfast was fine. Aircraft is more spacious than PIAs A320s. Staff was courteous.

### "I was impressed"
My first time flying on SereneAir from Karachi to Islamabad and return I was impressed. The flights left and arrived on time and the cabin crew was courteous and efficient. They are flying relatively new 737-800s with mood lighting and plenty of leg room. Onboard catering was also good. My only complaint is the inability to purchase tickets with a US credit card from their website.

### "hope this new airline succeeds"
Islamabad to Karachi. 11.30pm flight fully booked-had an aisle seat near the back. Pilot started to reverse from stand while passengers were still standing. Meal was served - a dinner which was not too bad and service was efficient. Aircraft was not new but clean -seats OK but not much leg room. Arrived on time, hope this new airline succeeds.

### "A very courteous welcome"
I was hesitant to fly this new airline, but gave it a try. Its website was easy to navigate but there were unresolved issues with credit card payment. Check-in was easy and staff were professional. A very courteous welcome at the aircraft door to every passenger. The all-female staff wore an elegant uniform. I had pre-reserved Seat 3F. I could tell from the cabin interior, its general upkeep and lighting that it was a new aircraft. The cabin was also very clean. Announcements, especially in English, were made in a very warm yet professional manner. Announcements from the cockpit were also nice. Food was average in quality, but enough in quantity. No complaints about it. They served a full dinner on a 9.25pm departure flight! Drinks arrived when I had finished the meal. It seems they finish serving meals first and then bring drink carts. A passenger in front of me got sick. Flight attendants repeatedly inquired about his well-being and asked if he needed any medication or special attention. Flight arrived on time. I hope SereneAir maintains its service standards in future.
