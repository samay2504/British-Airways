### "Would not recommend"
Not Verified |  Absolutely terrible. Customer service did not help at all. They kept telling us to call back in one hour and when we would they would still not be able to help. They cancelled our flight and didn’t offer a refund. Would not recommend.

### "the flight was canceled"
Not Verified |  Skymark is fine when all goes well. On the outbound trip from Tokyo to Shin Chitose my partner and I had no problems. Checking was done by machine and boarding was prompt. Inflight seats are okay, and legroom is okay for an LCC. The return trip never happened. We checked in and went to get lunch at the airport before the flight. As we made our way to security we saw the flight was canceled. As all other SkyMark flights to Tokyo were full we were told we had find our own way back after which point we could apply for reimbursement of our new tickets cost. All other airlines serving HND were full today so we ended up on Vanilla Air to NRT and getting home nearly nine hours later than planned. Skymark followed their rules so we cannot fault their front line staff for the lack of service. The bottom line with Skymark is that unless you are prepared to fend for yourself if something goes wrong it’s better to pay a bit more for an airline like JAL or ANA that is focused on customer service.

### "best budget airline I've flown with"
Flew with this airline today from Sapporo to Kobe and the leg room was larger than most airlines I've flown with and the service was impecable. For a budget airline, it included 20kg luggage as well as a complimentary small snack and coffee during flight. I however purchased a Coke and Soup for 200 yen (approx $2.50 AUD). Unlike most Australian airlines, the cabin crew remained inside the cabin for the majority of the flight, making sure everyone was okay and at one stage offering lollies to any needy sweet-tooth pax. I'd fly with them again and can safely say they were the best budget airline I've flown with.

### "pretty impressed by the quality"
I flew Skymark Airlines from Kobe to Tokyo Haneda on August 7th and I must say that I was pretty impressed by the quality of the airline. They do not provide any food but service is good. I had too much luggage and they only charged me ¥2000 for the extra 13 kilos I had checked. Seats are very comfortable and legroom is better than most international airlines. I guess it's at least 33 inches, maybe 34. Nice flight and on time. I will fly Skymark Airlines again in the future when I return to Japan.

### "comfy seat and legroom"
Tokyo Haneda to Sapporo return with Skymark Airlines. First leg on Boeing 737-800NG. New cabin, comfy seat and generous legroom for a low-cost airline. Even though I didn't purchase any, the drinks and snakcs are sold at a cheap price. Departure and arrival on time. Return leg, delayed for 30 mins due to congestion at destination airport. Return aircraft was an older Boeing 737-800. Very warm cabin temperature. But overall worth the ticket price. Definetely better than AirAsia and JetStar.

Flown Haneda-Chitose and Fukuoka-Haneda in the new A330. Very good seats almost like business class seats. (2-3-2). Service on board was excellent. Drinks and snacks for a small fee (about 100 euro for a coffee). Will fly with them again when in Japan.

Flew Tokyo Narita - Sapporo - Tokyo Narita. Flight from Narita was on time while from Sapporo to Narita was delayed for 1 hour. Overall flight was ok. Ground staff very professional.

### Skymark Airlines customer review
I flew Tokyo-Sapporo-Tokyo. I was pleasantly surprised at the efficiency and professionalism of the staff. The crew spoke English. We departed and arrived on-time. The great price combined with the excellent service ensures I will fly Skymark again.

### Skymark Airlines customer review
Very pleasant flight from OKA to ISG. Relaxed but very professional and friendly staff. At least one member spoke English. Maybe the least full flight I have ever experienced (10% in a B767): I was quite surprised that they use such a big plane for this route but it seems they only use this model on this airline. I had to buy a luggage allowance since my checked bag exceeded 15kg but the fee was quite decent: 500yen. Same as for the drinks service: I remember coffee is only a 100yen (1$) nothing to be angry at.

Narita to Naha Okinawa recently. Flight was excellent. On time clean new aircraft and great flight crew. Check in and boarding no issues. Professional and friendly staff. Highly recommended for travel in Japan. I am a world traveller and have flown many airlines. Skymark is by far one of the best.

Haneda to Kagoshima return. Efficient and clean no-frills airline. You have to buy onboard refreshments (they only have drinks you'll have to bring your own sandwiches) but the staff were friendly so yes I'll fly them again. I recommend checking in as early as possible and asking for an exit seat: there's more leg-room.

Fukuoka-Haneda-Fukuoka Fukuoka-Naha-Fukuoka. Good budget airline for domestic flights in Japan. Great value if you get your tickets in advance and easy payment options through the convenience store make it very convenient. The only downside is getting a refund if you choose to cancel your flight is notoriously difficult. Also no discount for flying round trip. Airplanes are no frills no food or entertainment but staff are professional and accommodating and flights are on time.

Sapporo to Nagoya. Check-in and boarding very efficient. New airplane B737-800. Service onboard was ok although you have to buy your food/drinks. On arrival at Central Japan Airport luggage was already waiting for us on the belt when we came in the arrival hall. Will certainly fly them again when in Japan.

### Skymark Airlines customer review
HND-CTS return. Check-in were helpful - didn't depart on time. Didn't expect much but to our luck on a new 737. Interior/lighting was very good a/c was clean and a good crew. They don't really speak English so that could be a potential error. Catering was pay per piece. Would fly them again.

Kobe to Nagasaki and Kumamoto to Haneda. Both flights on time. Used their website for booking - all you need to get your boarding pass is the credit card you used for the booking. They do have an English website but don't expect much or any actual service in English at check in time. On both flights I appeared to be the only westerner on board. Prices from their website can be very very cost effective - Y5100 to fly from Kyushu to Tokyo.

### Skymark Airlines customer review
I was able to book online smoothly and easily. Service is no frills but competent. I did not find any particular language barriers during my travel and the rates are definitely way more reasonable than other bigger airlines for domestic Japanese travel. Checking-in and boarding were simple and efficient.

### Skymark Airlines customer review
Skymark Airlines has some serious issues with the call centre. It is impossible to reach an agent and any attempts to do so are met with having to allow the phone to ring more than 30 times to then listen to a recording to tell you to call back or be prepared to be put on hold to then be put on hold for up to 20 minutes to then be automatically disconnected if an agent does not take your call before the time limit is up. Very frustrating and the money saved is little compensation for the time spent in trying to reach an agent. Once an agent actually does answer the phone they are little more help than an automated computer that only would follow simple requests. This airline company would do much better to hire some staff to be able to think outside of the box.

### Skymark Airlines customer review
Skymark is a low-fare airline in Japan. I flow from Tokyo Haneda to Fukuoka. The crew are very friendly and polite but cannot speak fluent English. The B767-300 is clean but I am very disappointed with their seats. The seats are very cramped and it is nearly impossible to move out from the seat with the configuration of 2-4-2. Although seats are narrow the price is extremely competitive.
