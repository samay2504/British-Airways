### "pleasantly appointed ATR 72"
Domestic 1:30 h flight from Ulaanbaatar to Dalandzadgad in South Mongolia, on Hunnu Air in July. Check-in and security clearance at the old ULN Chengis Khan Airport reasonably swift. Departure and arrival on time. Very pleasantly appointed ATR 72 in good state of repair. Friendly flight attendants. Coffee, water, snacks. All announcements in Mongolian and Russian (I guess). Cabin crew also speaks no English.
