### "absolutely zero concern for passengers time"
Flying with El Al was probably the worst experience of my life. The flight was postponed 4 times, by 6hours. And all they give, is just excuse. They said they sorry, but it doesn't matter, as changes nothing. How a company could have absolutely zero concern for passengers time or arrangement?

### “fell short of expectations”
Not Verified | My recent experience with EL AL was quite disappointing. From start to finish, almost every aspect of the journey fell short of expectations. The check-in process was chaotic and time-consuming, with long lines and inefficient service. The staff, while professional, seemed overwhelmed and not very accommodating to passengers' needs. Once on board, things didn't improve much. The seating was extremely cramped, making it uncomfortable for longer flights. The in-flight entertainment system was outdated and offered a very limited selection, which made the journey feel even longer. To top it off, the food quality was poor, with limited options and lackluster taste. Overall, flying with EL AL was a frustrating experience. They fell short in terms of service, comfort, and overall customer care. I wouldn't choose to fly with them again if other options are available, and if not - I will cancel the whole trip!

### "a wonderful service"
Thank you so much for a wonderful service. Nurit and her great team/staff were professional, attentive friendly and very helpful! I was traveling with my mom, and they made it easier for me and took care of her needs. I’d like to thank you all for being so nice and giving such a great service! You’re awesome: Arzo, Diana, Chen and special thanks to Mara ! In addition, the food was great!

### "crew were attentive and friendly"
The crew were attentive and friendly and constantly checking we are ok. I would especially like to thank flight attendant Osher who noticed I was upset and on the verge of crying and took me aside for a chat, tissue and tea. This made me feel I am already at home even before landing.

### "The service was disastrous"
Not Verified |   Review of flight LY320 - ELAL Company I traveled today on the flight of May 27, departing from Charles de Gaulle at 11:10 a.m. towards Tel Aviv, arriving at 5 p.m. a little late on flight LY320 with the ELAL company and I must say that this was an absolutely deplorable experience. The flight attendants seemed to be on the verge of depression: very nonchalant and extremely rude. The plane was extremely small, with absolutely no room to stretch your legs. Traveling with a baby was a nightmare. There was no empathy or understanding from the flight attendants to allow us to let our child sleep. I had to sacrifice myself and stand the entire flight, and by the end our little one was sleeping soundly in both seats. My wife also had to get up to let him sleep. Despite this, the staff made us wake up our child in the middle of sleep, supposedly to put on the seat belt, even though we were not yet in the landing phase of a certain TAL. This ended with staff intimidating me, asking for my passport and becoming very threatening, without even letting me speak. ("I'm going to call the police") The plane itself was without a TV and very small. The service was disastrous: they weren't even able to serve me tea properly, giving me an already used tea bag. A horror, a real horror. I totally deplore this Negligence. ELAL has lost all quality of service. It is strongly advised to avoid paying too much for a non-charter flight, as you can find much cheaper and much more comfortable flights. The staff of this company have no love of the job and seem to do it by huffing and puffing non-stop. This message about the deplorable theft of the El Al company absolutely does not reflect what I have experienced before. My love for Israel will never be questioned. I don't want to create confusion, but I want to say that this flight was a disaster. It is imperative that the company takes matters into its own hands. FR: Avis sur le vol LY320 - Compagnie ELAL J'ai voyagé ce jour le vol du 27 mai départ de Charles de Gaulle à 11h10 vers Tel Aviv arrivé 17h avec un peu de retard sur le vol LY320 avec la compagnie ELAL et je dois dire que ce fut une expérience absolument déplorable. Le personnel de bord semblait être au bord de la dépression : très nonchalant et extrêmement impoli. L'avion était extrêmement petit, avec absolument aucune place pour étendre les jambes. Voyager avec un bébé était un cauchemar. Il n'y avait aucune empathie ni compréhension de la part du personnel de bord pour nous permettre de laisser notre enfant dormir. J'ai dû me sacrifier et rester debout tout le vol, et à la fin, notre petit dormait profondément sur les deux sièges. Ma femme a également dû se lever pour le laisser dormir. Malgré cela, le personnel nous a imposé de réveiller notre enfant en plein sommeil soi-disant pour mettre la ceinture, alors que nous n'étions même pas encore en phase d'atterrissage une certaine TAL. Cela a fini par une intimidation de la part du personnel, me demandant mon passeport et devenant très menacant , sans même me laisser m'exprimer. (« Je vais appeler la police ») L'avion lui-même était sans télé et très petit. Le service était désastreux : ils n'ont même pas été capables de me servir un thé correctement, me donnant un sachet de thé déjà usagé. Une horreur, une véritable horreur. Je déplore totalement cette Negligeance . ELAL a perdu toute qualité de service. Il est vivement conseillé d'éviter de payer trop cher pour un vol non charter, car vous pouvez trouver des vols bien moins onéreux et beaucoup plus confortables. Le personnel de cette compagnie n'a pas l'amour du métier et semble le faire en soufflant et soupirant non-stop. Ce message sur le vol déplorable de la compagnie El Al ne reflète absolument pas ce que j’ai connu auparavant. Mon amour pour Israël ne sera jamais mis en question. Je ne souhaite pas créer d’amalgame, mais je tiens à dire que ce vol a été une catastrophe. Il est impératif que la compagnie reprenne les choses en main.

### "Customer service was terrible"
Not Verified |  I booked a trip before the events on October 7th. I had to cancel my trip and El Al was not accommodating at all even though this is an extenuating circumstance. They offered me a partial refund taking 1/3 of my total expense. Customer service was terrible. We were hung up on multiple times after asking to speak to a supervisor. Wait times to talk to a representative were over an hour. You would think this company would be a bit more accommodating to people who had to cancel a trip during this time but all they care about is money. Never flying with them again, they’ve taken enough of my money.

### "Always some bad experience"
Not Verified |  Such a bad service. Changing flight time and no response from service at all. Been waiting now for 10 days to get a response. Just stay away. Always some bad experience with them.

### "service was good"
Not Verified | The service was good, everything that I ordered came in a minute or less and all my needs were attended to. Free snacks of hot fudge and tea. Fast and there were no delays (not late for take off or landing) Really recommend, thanks for a great flight. I am really happy.

### "they have an awful service"
It has a clear and direct discrimination passengers. It’s my second time that I’m flying with El Al and both were terrible experience. You can feel disgraced and humiliated due to special and extra luggage check and due to the personal question that are asked by security during boarding. All of this discrimination is due to the fact that you’re not Jewish or white. Except the direct discrimination, they have an awful service. Flight attendants are rude and arrogant, they don’t smile and need to ask for thing several times. Do your self a service and avoid this company.

### "cancellation fees in this war environment"
Not Verified |  Outrageous that EL AL is charging cancellation fees in this war environment where tours are being cancelled and all other airlines have cancelled their flights.

### "refuse to switch the voucher to refund"
Bought a ticket for my wife for her Birthday. War broke out a few days later so I tried to cancel the tickets as promised by El AL without any charges, however, it is not possible to do that on their website only through phone call. El Al never answered their phones for several days which is understandable due to the overwhelming call volume. since the flight was the next day I took a voucher with limited credit for 12 months and thought I would get the money when they answered just not to lose my money for "no show". Today they answered after spending hours on the phone, but they refuse to switch the voucher to refund. One Star for you El AL, and I or anyone from my family will never ever fly with you. Just for comparison, The ticket back to Israel was with Turkish Airlines which allowed cancellation without penalty (due to the war) on their website. It took less than a minute to get a full refund.

### "Shame on El Al"
Not Verified |   Shame on El Al. Was so excited to go to Israel for a family wedding. Ticket purchased for Saturday non stop flight (non stop) from Miami to Tel Aviv on 10/07/23 (Saturday) night. War had broken out earlier that day. Needless to say the wedding was cancelled. El Al never answered their phones for several days (understandable due to overwhelming call volume. However when she did speak to someone all they would offer was a limited credit for 12 months OR…refund but a $275 fee. The other airlines were so accommodating. Not El Al. Trying to make money on us during war time. Do not fly EL Al, we never will.

### "Inflight service was excellent"
Inflight service was excellent. Friendly attentive staff. Excellent cabin and very comfortable seat including the lie flat bed. Cabin has understated tones which feels modern , luxurious and comforting. Staff had excellent knowledge of local wines being served. Ground service however in Ben Gurion and lounge needs a little bit of a further polish. Check in staff were a little too nonchalant and the lounge had a damp smell but good range of food and beverages. The lounge is also in need of a bit of an update.

### "What a nightmare"
When arriving to the destination and after waiting for my luggage for an hour, i learned that EL Al decided not to wait for luggage arriving from transit flights. They didn’t lose our bags, they just decided to leave with out them. Now I'm stuck with no bag waiting for a rude delivery guy that should have shown up today but got the wrong address. What a nightmare. If you want a company that knowingly gets her customer stuck without clothes, medicine etc. for more than 48 hr then El Al is the place for you.

### "El Al did a good job"
Not Verified |  It is never enjoyable to fly 10+ hours but I think El Al did a good job. Flight attendants were nice and responsive. They served 2 meals. Boarding seemed quick. No complaints.

### "never been a premium airline"
I have been a loyal customer of El Al for 40 years. I have flown intensively, especially during my years as a global marketing manager for an Israeli company. We are now retired and travel mainly for pleasure. El Al has never been a premium airline, but we usually have been feeling secure, safe and in good hands. Cabin crews have been attentive and an advantage for those that do not communicate in other language besides Hebrew. We pay a premium for that, never mind! Our last flight, May 2023, from Prague to TLV has been a summit of disappointment. First of all, we pay to flight on full fare category and none of the low, low cuts usual these days. You want to be competitive, do it by improving service not the opposite ways with cuts and cuts. To start with, the aircraft was, I think, Sun D'Or vintage, the sometime low cost company of El Al. They had probably rescued the plane from the El Al vintage museum. The aircraft had probably undergone some thorough technical check up (no problems with the flight itself). The cabin had been left for the last and forgotten. My particular seat was found not within the safety norms and we were required to move to another row. Fortunately the emergency exit row was available, but that is not the issue. The widely advertised El Al WiFi inboard was not functioning, in spite of the best efforts of the crew. The sandwich was tasty but, come on, this was not a low cost flight, no food, no coffee, water at the most. We had the option to check our trolleys and avoid the hassles of cabin carrying. For commodity we opted to carry them with us. But with such an aircraft, inside space was very limited and without too many explanations our trolleys were sent to the belly. Big difference : The cabin crew was in generally attentive and managed to do their best. The checking and boarding crew was unprofessional. No Hebrew speakers, no Israeli security personnel. Mind you. We pay a premium to have Israeli personnel in those positions, including stations chiefs. The boss of the departure crew could barely speak Hebrew. So, if you're going to be like the others then the game is open for all the Israeli travellers. If you are not going to receive what you have been assured and paid for the last 40 years, just come into the open and be like the others.

### "Better take another airline"
You pay extra for baby seats, you won't get it on board. And then you have to contact customer service to get your money back for the extras. You paid extra for using an airline that has baby seats. But it is fake marketing, better pay less and get better alternatives. On board we were ignored and treated poorly even though we didn't complain or annoy the staff, there is just negative energy from the staff. We didn't receive our food, I had to go specially to the attendant and ask why we can't get food and rudely answered "But you got drinks. Better take another airline.

### "Toilets were dirty"
Not Verified |  We flew at 11:30pm and there was no tv on the flight. No place to charge your phone. Toilets were dirty. Could not get water very easily. The security was very good on South African side. When we arrived in Tel Aviv not much help with the passports.

### "9 weeks passed without getting the refund"
Not Verified |  Had refundable business class tickets to Israel on El Al in February 2023. Unfortunately due to health issues we had to cancel. El Al told us we would get our refund in 6-9 weeks. We received all other refunds on hotels, tours and museums within days. When the 9 weeks passed without getting the refund, we called and were told our issue was being sent to billing and at a minimum we would get a status email if not payment in 24-48 hours. When we received nothing, we called again and spoke to a supervisor who can only say our claim is a priority. When we asked to speak to his manager, he said he was the highest level English speaking supervisor and since we don’t speak Hebrew there was nobody else to talk to. Issue is still not resolved

### "no news about your luggage"
First of all I received an email from Elal informing me that the check in counter opens 4 hours before the flight due to the high number of passengers. I arrived at the check in counter with my 4 years old daughter and waited 1 hour before the staff finally opened the check-in, the staff was siiting at their counter but not doing anything. I checked in two suitcases. Few minutes before landing, a flight attendant came to me and told me "for security reasons your suitcase was sent in the flight, please approach the lost and found counter at the airport" I had 2 suitcases and the flight attendant could not tell me if both luggages were left behind. When I filed a report for the missing suitcase the El Al staff told me "your luggage will be send in the very worst case in the third flight from Paris to Tel Aviv, I am exaggerating, 3 flights is the maximum". So I tracked all the El Al flights from Paris to Tel Aviv and after the fifth flight I called the hotline for luggage irregularities, "sir, no news about your luggage". That is crazy to be so incompetent, they are abusing the passengers, this is not abusive security, this is a pure example of people abuse. I had fresh food carefully packed in an isotherm bag, it's all wasted. I have important documents for an appointment at the consulate in Tel Aviv. No clothes for few days. At the time of writing, my luggage is still in Paris for security reason. I won't fly El Al  again, terrible airline, disgusting service. Few words about the flight itself, it was a very old boeing 737, dirty plane 0 comfort with their dirty seats. No flight entertainments, no drinks and no food.

### "treated like a terrorist"
Not Verified |  Before the boarding they questioned me and treated like a terrorist. I was flying back to Yerevan from Mozambique, from a business trip, using multiple transfers. Two security officers questioned me for more than 2 hours. Then they took off my luggage and sent it back only on a week. Service is nothing close to the first class. They treat you like a lower class person not allowing even to book a seat next to the window.

### "downgraded us at the last minute"
They downgraded us at the last minute to make room in Business Class for their own employees. I ended up in coach and no way to get compensation for their deliberate overbooking. They have no problem moving your flight or cancelling it whenever they feel like it with absolutely no remorse or concerns for their passengers. This will be the last time I ever book with them.

### "Worst airline I have experienced"
Worst airline I have experienced. Not only is the security detail so annoying with all the interrogations. But the worst part is my baggage. 5 days into Israel and no baggage. I have important stuff in there. My Christmas has been completely ruined. Every contact number they give me doesn’t work or tells me to call this other place only to tell me there is nothing they can do but keep checking. I’ve contacted them via Facebook messenger, whatsapp and I don’t even use whatsapp. I’ve sent emails, I have a file number, but what good will that do? This airline and airport is a  Joke, no respect for their flyers or customers.

### "This airline is a joke"
My fiancé and I flew from JFK to Tel Aviv recently. I am not Jewish and have a New Zealand passport. My fiancé is Jewish and has an Israeli passport. While waiting to check in, we were questioned by 3 different people. I was pulled away from my fiancé twice for questioning. I was asked personal questions about my religion (if you are not Jewish, how are you planning to get married to a Jewish person ? (My fiancé is not very religious and we respect each other’s religions.) What Jewish holidays do you celebrate ? How did you guys meet ? Do you speak Hebrew? (Despite telling the El Al rep that I don’t speak Hebrew, I kept being asked to tell them what I know in Hebrew) How do you communicate at home if you don’t speak Hebrew? (We live in Australia and speak English) What will you be doing in Israel on each particular day (it was a holiday and we were planning to just take it easy). What are the names of your fiancé’s relatives? What do you do for work? Who paid for the trip? Eventually we were allowed to check in, but were told to meet El Al rep at the gate in 30 min, as he needed to speak to us for 5 mins before we board. No problem. We were at the gate on time. EL Al reps were not. We had to wait for another 30 min for them to arrive to the gate. After that we were taken to a small room with another 5 Non Jewish people. We were swiped for bombs twice. Our phones were swiped for bombs. Then El Al rep told us that they will take our bags away and search them in a different room (not in our presence). At this time my fiancé lost it and told them that if they are going to search our bags, then it has to be in front of us, as we have valuables in our carry on. Of course they refused and took our bags away. Later they came back with an unopened brand new iPhone that we bought as a gift for my fiancé’s mum and demanded that we unpackaged the box. Since it was a present, we begged not to open the brand new phone. Showed receipts from an apple store, but were told that we won’t fly if we don’t open the phone. We had no choice, and of course they found nothing. They never apologised for wasting 3 hours of our life and treating a simple couple on a holiday like criminals. That’s not the end of the story. When we arrived in Tel Aviv, we realised that our suitcase didn’t make it on the plane. It was still in USA. Luckily it arrived next day and we had to drive back to the airport, as they don’t deliver lost luggage like other airlines around the world do. It took us another hour to pick up our suitcase, as everything was very unorganised. While waiting we spoke to many other frustrated EL Al customers. Also, couple of month ago my fiancé’s mum was refused to check in for her flight, as they overbooked it. This airline is a joke.

### "This is a screwed up airline"
Traying to check-in online for the flight from London to Tel Aviv is impossible since the website doesn't accept neither the booking code (used to check-in on line from Tel-Aviv) nor the ticket #. Contacting El-Al on Whatsapp is like talking to an idiot since they provide the link to the same check-in website and it doesn't work. This is not a surprise with Israeli websites which have a tendency to fair and not respond. Trying to get any help by calling in the phone number published for UK (London/Manchester) all you get is a holiday greeting (Halloween?) This is a screwed up airline - expensive with the worst customer service. Fly whatever other airline but not El-Al.

### "they did not show up on time"
Not Verified |  El Al ask to be at the terminal at least 3.5 hours before the flight. However, they themselves did not show up on time and we just waited for hours to check in our luggage. I also had issues with them in the past, and they are very expensive.

### "they became a rip off"
I travel with them very often but after the 2022 COVID 19 precautions lifted, they became a rip off with usual services that they turned into Add-Ons requiring payments such as 90$ for luggage above 8kg and 20$ for a choice of own seat not mentioning the interrogation prior to flight check.

### "the crew was very nice"
Tel Aviv to Toronto, both flights amazing, the crew was very nice. Food and snacks delicious except the egg (no one like it), the flight’s attendants were nice and helpful. When we came back from Tel Aviv to Toronto me and my mum seated in different place not together, i asked if i can move her and sit beside me to help her when she need any help. They moved her beside me close to exit door without any charge and 15 minutes before the airplane landed at Toronto they moved me and my mum to the business class to help us to exit first. Thank you so much for all the crew.

### "an absolute nightmare"
Not Verified |  Got to airport 3.5 hours early. Car rental shuttle took 30-45 min, stood in line in line for 2.5 hours while one person very leisurely checks in 40+ people. Finally get to baggage check with 30-45 minutes until flight. The woman yelled at us for showing up late (why didn't you show up 4 hours before?!) and tells us the flight has rejected us (even though boarding was still happening) and that we need to go reschedule. Get yelled at again by another woman who says the next flight isn't until tomorrow and will cost an additional $500. Overall, an absolute nightmare, just to lose a day of my honeymoon for absolutely no good reason - except maybe being difficult for the sake of being difficult. Avoid at all costs.

### "nasty and unreasonable"
Tel Aviv to Rome. I flew with an infant and by the gate they told me I wouldn't be able to take my carry on with me that I would have to take everything important out and check it in. As much as I pleaded that i"m flying with an infant if they could reconsider they were nasty and wouldn't budge while allowing other passengers on with their carry ons. Only to get worse when we arrived in JFK we found out that our carry on luggage was never checked in it was left in Tel Aviv with a promise to get it delivered within 24-48 hours as of now it's more then 48 hours and I still didn't get my luggage with no one contacting me about it. They were nasty and unreasonable.

### "Terrible customer service"
Not Verified |  Terrible customer service. They lost my baggage and it was returned to me 6 days after arrival. There was no one to talk to through those days to find out the status of my claim and when I will receive my baggage. After I received it I tried to file a claim for the money I spent on clothes during those days and their online portal kept logging me out. I tries a couple dozen times to contqct them and file a claim to no avail.

### "smooth comfortable flight"
Another smooth comfortable flight. Flying premium on El Al is consistently on a high level. Great food, service, entertainment and wifi. Comfortable cabin with great seat and amenities.

### "I was treated very badly"
I was treated very badly by a rude receptionist at the Business Check in Desk, I spent £1600.00 and they wanted to move me to Economy with no explanation, just saying the flight was over booked. When I booked the flight 3 weeks before most of the seats in Business were free and I choose my sit. Someone they knew or someone who payed more money got priority over me, the lady at the counter even shouted at me and the 2 shift managers just lied to my face and did not give me any explanation why was I the only one that had to except being downgraded, I was not even offered any money back, just a flight free flight to Europe which was of no use to me, as I will never again fly EL AL, they just give a bad name to Israel and ruined my whole trip. If you are reading this avoid EL AL and book instead in British Airways as I always got a first class service with them.

### "3 hour wait to get to baggage drop"
3 hour wait to get to baggage drop. They let all the Israeli citizens cut through the line. All non Israeli passengers ended up standing in line for hours. I waited 3 hours. Then another 30 min for security. None of the staff were helpful. They were all rude and did not care. They had 3 staff on at baggage collection with hours of passengers to go through. Highly recommend never using this airline!

### "Cancelled our flight on departure day"
Not Verified |  Cancelled our flight on the departure day "for operational reasons" . Did not suggest any alternative flights or residence. Did not answer our calls in any office in Germany (it was a working day afternoon). Did not answer our calls to Israeli office for at least 1 hour. In facebook messenger answered in 2 days only, in WhatsApp in 1 day. Did not bring money back, just suggested a 1-year voucher for 300$. Do not answer calls and do not call back at all from the Israeli office, don't suggest a proper customer service in their call-center

### "large selection of IFE"
El Al has the best Premium Economy product on this route, US carriers don't compare to the seat pitch, width and comfort, impeccable service from the flight crew , the food served on china, a large selection of IFE, and even the goodie bags. I like the curtain they use to cut off this section from economy.

### "Low cost airlines give much better service"
Complete lack of customer service. If you book and need any support, forget it. Web Booking was relatively easy, but after that forget it. Web logon as a user just doesn't work and cant reset a password by any method. WhatsApp doesn't work just get in a loop with the bot that refers to the call center Call center - no chance of an answer - I received a call back after three days and was on hold for 20 minutes with no answer! I guess I wont be able to get a call back from a human. I thought to give ELAL a second chance after they cancelled a flight on me 2 months ago with only 2 days warning, but now I cancelled a flight due to warnings of pilot strikes - received a coupon after 2 days but I want a refund. By law refunds are available - but there are no automated web or app buttons that work for that option (I wonder why?). Low cost airlines give much better service. ELAL get your act together!

### "hands down the worst experience"
Not Verified |  Wish I had read the comments on here before booking with El Al. This was hands down the worst experience I have had on any airline ever. It is virtually impossible to speak to anyone on the phone at El Al. Online booking system was relatively straight forward and even booked and paid for exit row seats. Flight departure time changed one week out from departure. Exit row seats not honoured at online checkin. Blatantly lied to at check in with assurances that we had just been moved to different exit row seats - the new seats were not exit row seats. Delayed or deliberately withheld my bag from the flight and only delivered the bag 2 days later. Impossible to contact anyone from El Al and the WhatsApp option is just a joke. Food terrible, service terrible and toilets disgusting. Thankfully it was only 3 hours of hell. There is not much to like about this airline. Flight times on this route are also elongated by about 30 min as compared to non-Israeli airlines due to geo-political concerns for Israeli flagged carriers.

### "Low cost service at full service fares"
Troubles start when you try to contact them: call center is open only in the morning of working days. They suggest you to use their whatsapp H24 contact that is a total mess: you spent hours with the system asking your name again and again with no solution at all. Their app is not working at all, only a beautiful screen with a pic of the sky. So if you do online check-in you must print boarding card on paper, as pdf on smartphone is not contemplated. It is mandatory to be at the airport 4 four before scheduled departure, also if you have only hand baggage and have check-in done. At the airport you have to go through different counters, which aim is not clear, but still you are at the gate 3 hours prior to takeoff. Gates have not enough seats for all people waiting for the flight. Only at the moment of scheduled boarding time the flight was delayed 90 minutes. Later, they changed four times the gate of departure. At the new boarding time the crew was not yet on board, they arrived with no hurry 10 minutes later. So takeoff was with 120 minutes of delay. Once on board, just a "sorry for the delay" from the captain, no reason provided at all. Cabin service was rude, food on board (4 hour flight) was a sandwich with a very small bottle of water. It was my first and last experience with them. Low cost service at full service fares.

### "they don't answer their customers"
Not Verified |  El Al is simply the worst airline I've ever been on. Even before the flight I was experiencing major problems with them. First I booked from TLV to EWR and I paid for extra legroom. The first thing they did was switch the time of departure by a few hours. Then they downgraded my seat after paying for one. And finally they switched the airport where I was supposed to be landing and taking which for me is not a feasible option. They simply changed every detail of the flight without some sort of compensation or communication. I tried calling their customer service and after an hour someone picks up and I explain to them what the situation is and they put me on hold again and never returned. I tried calling them multiple times but they don't answer their customers. On board the staff was rude and unpleasant making this entire ordeal miserable.

### "the whole experience was traumatic"
Not Verified |  Unfortunately El Al just can’t seem to get their business in order. I booked a return flight to Dubai and last minute (literally the day before I returned) El Al changed my flight time from the evening to the middle of the day, which meant I was unable to complete my meetings and work as planned. There was no offer of an alternative flight, or compensation, and I was only aware of the time change due to spending hours trying to contact their customer service only to be cut off (while I was paying international charges) 6 times. I didn’t receive a text, email or call to let me know of this change. Once I boarded the plane it was clear something strange was going on, I was on the only woman on the flight, other than the staff. Travelling solo as a British person but an Israeli citizen I found the experience horrible and overwhelming. The plane had been booked out for a male company trip and I was one of very few passengers who weren’t part of the company. I sat squeezed behind a row of men who were far too large for their seats and was squashed, pushed and shoved the entire journey. When I asked if they could stop, I was ridiculed. The plane was obscenely loud as they all shouted across rows to one another while the staff did nothing to stop this, with no regard for the passengers outside of their organisation on the plane. The men were rude, offensive and the whole experience was traumatic. As someone who moved to Israel and travels multiple times a month, El Al should be the go-to airline but unfortunately it’s a total shambles. Don’t fly with them, it was a horrible experience and one I won’t be having ever again. I highly advise using any other airline to fly anywhere to or from Israel.

### "Don't bother with premium"
Don't bother with premium on El Al. The airline provided has no dedicated check in for premium seat holders. Premium seat holders get no preference in boarding and staff allows all upper stowage to be utilised by none premium seat holders. Took 3 hours to pass security and check in (and I pre checked - of no use). Worst airline ever.

### "All in all a good flight"
We got to the airport early so check in was quick. I am not a huge fan of El Al as have had bad experiences, but this time the staff were friendly and helpful. All went smoothly. The entertainment was good with a fair selection. The meal served was good for economy plane food. They don't advertise that hot drinks and soft drinks and snacks are served in the back kitchen I only know this from recent flights with them. The seats on El Al are always cramped. We were given blankets. All in all a good flight no one was rude all the staff helpful.

### "They were beyond rude, unhelpful"
I flew El Al about 10 years ago and vowed to never again, but didn’t have much choice today, but I wish I’d used literally any other option. El Al staff are the rudest I’ve ever dealt with, anywhere. They left us stranded in Madrid Airport, after not updating their website they tell you to read with on covid entry rules before they changed, and not providing any warming that they were changing. Yesterday (and every other day we checked prior), it said an antigen test was okay to board, plus you have to book a PCR at Tel Aviv airport to do when you land (which we had). We checked the rules again before we left, went and got an antigen test, and set off on our journey to Tel Aviv, via Lisbon and Madrid, for a very special occasion. By the time we got to Madrid the rules had changed, with no warning given at all. They were beyond rude, unhelpful, blaming Iberia for letting us get there and offering beyond less than zero assistance. I really don’t have words. The manager was utterly awful. One of the worst humans I’ve ever had the misfortune to encounter. They just said to go speak with Iberia, even though I booked it all with them. You can’t contact customer services either and just wait and wait. It’s hopeless. Do yourself a favour and avoid at all cost. Any other option I’d better then El Al. Any at all.

### "They humiliated me as a woman"
Not Verified |  I’ll never recommend this airline! Very rude control before check in the luggage. I needed to fly to Dubai from Milan via Tel Aviv. In Milan I met this person who checked me and under all pressure of the security I denied to fly and cancelled my tickets. I’ve never met so rude people. They humiliated me as a woman, and I was treated so bad. They asked me so many private questions, about my family, work. They checked me 30 mins. In the end I just refused to fly, because they told me that I can fly just with my wallet and phone. Terrible service. This is not how’s support to be. Please don’t fly with this airplane, if you don’t want to be humiliated.

### "Terrible customer service"
EL Al is the worst airline company that I've ever seen. They canceled my flight and never notified me regarding flight cancelation, moreover, once I reported to their customer support about it, they've admitted that they had some issues and the notification email didn't arrive. I was at the airport at 5 a.m. and discovered that my flight was canceled, I was waiting for their response for weeks, and EL AL declined to compensate me an alternative flight. Terrible customer service.

### "absolutely to be avoided"
Milan to Tel Aviv. A horror, absolutely to be avoided. 1 hour late, no room, awful seats and everyone on top of each other in full corona. All low-cost companies are better | Une horreur, à absolument éviter. 1h de retard, pas de place, sièges horribles et tout le monde l’un sur l’autre en plein corona. Toutes les compagnies low-cost sont meilleures.

### "Avoid like the plague"
My flight got cancelled due to Covid-19 and I have been waiting one year now for a refund and I still did not receive it! Customer service told me the money is on it's way. Customer service is extremely rude. My boyfriend has also had countless issues with EL AL. Avoid like the plague.

### "They lost my baggage"
They lost my baggage as there was no one to help you at the carousel I tried asking multiple officers and other officials all were looking for the El Al associates who just didn’t care to show up today. Barely missed my flight to Boston all because these people working this airline can’t figure it out.

### "I've been waiting eight months for my refund"
Airline cancelled my flights due to Covid. I've been waiting eight months for my refund. Every time I call, the agents are unnecessarily rude. I will never, ever fly this airline again.

### "staff friendly most of the time"
Miami to Tel Aviv. El Al had very good security and made my family feel safe. The staff were friendly most of the time. Unfortunately, by the time they got to my seat, 8K, they were out of the food of my choice. I recommend picking a seat closer to the front of the cabin for first food choice. The crew has unfortunately locked the 787 electronic dimming windows shut, so you couldn’t see outside for the whole flights. I do recommend if you are traveling with 2 people, pick seats 1D and G, 3D and G, 5D and G, or 7D and G for seat nearer to each other. If you are traveling solo, I recommend seats 2A and K, 4A and K, 6A and K, or 8A and K.

### "I tore up my return ticket"
Not Verified |  I chose EL AL believing in Israeli efficiency in so many areas. I was surprised, before I flew to read guidance to passengers "dont be rude to airline staff", almost as if they expected passengers to be annoyed with service. Security at Heathrow was poor as the "extra" booked luggage X ray machine was not working , however most airline from Heathrow dont have this extra checking. The flight, seats, leg room food was average and service not very friendly. It became apparent the plane was delayed and I might miss my connection at Tel Aviv. so I asked a stewardess to ensure my checked in bags got on the next flight. Her attitude didn't give me confidence she would do this, Sure enough after another mediocre flight to Johannesburg my bag didn't arrive. After waiting at the carousel I asked where the El Al office was. I eventually found this but no one was there. and no notice of how to contact staff. The next door office gave me a number to ring and I was told someone would meet me at their office. An hour later someone came and took details of my bag but couldn't say when it would arrive but said it would be sent to my hotel. No apology. I asked how much of my costs of extra clothes would be reimbursed but he couldn't say. Eventually after 3 days my bag and clothes arrived, again no apologies and no reimbursement of expenses. At the end of my stay I tore up my return ticket and booked a single on SAA.

### "Avoid at any costs"
Avoid at any costs if you have any self esteem. They delayed the flight for hours without explanation, ransacked the luggage without explanation and on top of it they treat the non-Israeli passengers like second-class human beings, the only ones to be targeted for random appalling checks and treated with the utmost lack of any politeness. First and last time with this joke of a company.

### "Staff were smiling and helpful"
Budapest to Tel Aviv. Check in and security was quick and efficient, boarding was quick and efficient. The plane was fairly new. Staff were smiling and helpful. They called me out by name and told me I had points That I was going to lose and I brought some nice things from the duty free book using the points not money. The sandwiches and water were nice and soft drinks and hot drinks were served in the galley. The return flight cost us less than the low cost competitor and we had cases and food and drinks and we were very satisfied. An improvement for an Airline that we have had some bad flights with in the past

### "wanted to write this to thank you"
On a recent flight from Newark to Tel Aviv my wife had a rather unpleasant experience, and I wanted to write this to thank you for the way that you handled it. My son, who is just about 3 years old, suffers from Cerebral Palsy and is handicapped. His handicap is understandably difficult for him, as his parents, it is difficult for us as well. One of the most difficult times for us, and for him, is when we need to fly. My son is in a regimented routine within his therapeutic school / services and taking him out of the routine, into an area which he feels constricted (a plane) is very very challenging, but we do it often, to bring him to the US for special treatments. On Thursday (16/1/2020) my wife and son were returning from one of these trips abroad, following an intense week of therapies, evaluations, etc. This trip was different than others in that it was the shortest trip we have done and  it was the first time my wife and son were flying alone, without my daughter and I. At some point in the flight my son got very uncomfortable and began crying, loudly. My wife began the usual routine of holding him, walking with him, etc… trying to sooth and calm his nerves, but nothing was working. As this was happening, out of nowhere, our son began to throw up uncontrollably. My wife was shocked and started crying herself. At this exact moment a frustrated passenger got up and began verbally abusing her - yelling in front of the entire plane that she needs to get our child in check. My wife responded explaining our son’s challenges and disabilities, at which time others around her joined in, causing the abusive passenger to take his seat and quiet down. And here is where your team stepped up. Almost immediately my wife and son were surrounded by flight attendants, helping to clean the area, diffuse the situation, and even assisted my wife in cleaning up our son. The attendants continued coming with warm towels, blankets, and other items that they may have needed. One of the flight attendants even came and sat with my wife and son for about 15 minutes, talking and being supportive to them. She even offered to play with our son so that my wife could go clean herself up. Words cannot begin to express the thanks and gratitude that I have to your staff for this.

### "the seats were horribly outdated"
Not Verified |  I’m never flying El Al to Israel again. BOS-TLV, December 2019. Flight was operated by a 12-year-old 777 (4x-ECF) so not an old plane, but the seats were horribly outdated. My seats bed feature didn’t work (the motor for the recline was broken) and every seat in business was full so I couldn’t sleep the whole flight. Archaic IFE didn’t work either, surprise surprise. Seats were uncomfortable and incredibly narrow for business class - 7 seats across is almost unheard of today for a business product. What makes it worse is that El Al was almost double the price of other airlines and instead of getting more you get less. I can’t stand the fact that Boston is the only destination in North America that el al serves without the 787 Dreamliner. Pathetic. Crew were rude and had no intention of making me happy. Never, ever fly El Al’s old airplanes.

### "Food is not great"
San Francisco to Tel Aviv. KLM- Air France lounge in SF is the one you get if you are a premium passenger its below average and old without showers. The 787  business class is nice and up to date configuration with aisle access from every seat. Food is not great and how they serve it in one tray is not premium at all, no real bar service for food and drinks during this long flight. Aircrew is great.

### "WIFI works good"
Real business class for 2ourflight. Seats in 2x2 configuration, aperitif and diner served. Dinner was cold dishes only - why? if it was a warm dish I would applause. Cabin crew was as professional and nice. WIFI works good and free.

### "Seats were not comfortable"
Tel Aviv to Vienna. Both flights were delayed, only on our return flight an excuse and explanation was given. Both flights were oversold and especially in TLV they even tried to seperate groups which is in my opinion an absolute no-go. The planes did not look very inviting (cleaning was certainly reduced to a minimum). Crew was quite nice on the flight to TLV (experienced and mature crew members) but on the flight back there was not even a hint of a smile (young ones but certainly with no motivation). Service was quite surprising - somehow I thought on a 3,5 hours flight there would be offered a bar service (or at least a possibility to purchase drinks) but they only distributed medium-size water bottles and an overheated sandwich which had no taste at all. Seats were not comfortable at all. I assume for the chaos at the airport in TLV EL AL is not really responsible but the check-in area looked and felt extremely disorganized. Really feel sorry for those people who have to use it frequently.

### "the absolute worse airline to fly with"
Budapest to Tel Aviv with El Al Israel Airlines. This is the absolute worse airline to fly with. I fly 3 times a year, I have never had a problem this serious with an aircraft. Their customer service is a joke. No one answers. The website doesn’t work when you want to check in or order a luggage. Do yourselves a favor and don’t fly with this airline.

### "extremely pleasant journey"
I had an extremely pleasant journey. The premium economy product outranks other airlines on that route. The staff are very friendly and attentive, seats extremely comfortable and go back quite far and the pillow and blankets are soft and cosy. The food was outstanding and the entertainment plentiful. There is also free basic wifi for whatsapp and email and works really well.

### "they finally canceled the flight"
Boston to Tel Aviv. Was heading to Israel to Volunteer for The Jewish farmers in Samaria. Some of the staff was very abrasive, while others were very nice. We'r were loaded onto the plane and sat there for 3 hours until they finally canceled the flight due to mechanical issues. It then took an hour and a half to get our baggage. We had to pay for our own hotel rooms for 2 nights with the promise we'd be reimbursed. Then the flight was delayed because the pilot wasn't in the plane on time and the catering service wasn't there. I thought El Al would be the best way to fly to Israel but now I'm thinking not.

### "Very pleasant journey"
Tel Aviv to Berlin. Flight left on time and arrived before schedule. Spacious dedicated business class cabin, friendly and efficient crew. Food was nicely presented, fresh and flavourful. Business Class service at and in El Al quite good. Very pleasant journey.

### "food was embarrassing"
Barcelona to Tel Aviv. One of the last flights of the 747 for El Al before they will be replaced by the new 787 8 or 9. Well it was a vintage flight with an old aircraft that we all loved. The business seats are like they are from the 90's so no real flat bed and the audio was very old without VOD etc. Service was good as usual but food was embarrassing. El Al changed the menu and now serve only sandwiches for EU flights. Very basic, poor and absolutely not enough for an almost 5hr flight.

### "Absolutely horrible staff"
Tel Aviv to Munich. Absolutely horrible staff. Asking same questions again and again. Then did extra checks on my suitcase. I had liquids placed inside which were nicely wrapped up. They removed the wrappings and padding when checking the inside of my suitcase. When I opened my suitcase everything was spilled over. In fact from my window seat (40K) I witnessed the mishandling of my suitcase. They first threw it on the ground and then threw it on the conveyor belt. I would never fly with this airline ever again.

### "Worst trip ever!"
Not Verified |  Moscow to Tel-Aviv. Worst trip ever! Before I came even, asked me 100 of questions, even though it is the 4th time I’m going there. All the time the same questions. Every time keeping me for 6 hours on the border. Was flying there with economy and business. Doesn’t make a big difference! Once, I came at 12 at the airport, even though my flight was at 6, and I was exactly in time, and only because I was trying to hurry them up! Will never fly with this airline any more!

### "Extremely lousy airline"
Tel Aviv to Bangkok. Extremely lousy airline. Lost my baggage and did not bother about my claims. Multiple emails sent and also contacted local handling agency but still no avail.

### "poor for a premium airline"
Nice to Tel Aviv. Old 737 that was refurbished very nicely. Looked like new. All seats and cabin are new. Real Business class with recline seats and all the rest is economy. Gate and counter location is awful - no place to seat, super busy and feels like low cost. The crew was OK not more than that as El Al recently pulled out serving food on EU flights. They have very poor salad or sandwich. Poor, not enough for a 4h flight and very uncomfortable. Security check-in El Al asked to arrive airport 3H before departure, add the fact the Nice airport is very small and so at the end the entire tour is very long. A wrong move and poor for a premium airline.

### "Worst airline experience I've ever had"
London Heathrow to Tel Aviv with El Al Israel Airlines. Worst airline experience I've ever had. Planes are very old, my in-flight entertainment was unusable, the remote was missing buttons and the screen so fuzzy it was impossible to see. Flights delayed, endless interrogations and bag searches, they didn't deliver my luggage until more than 3 days after I arrived, promised some compensation, it never arrived, their customer support email doesn't even respond to email. They don't seem to care the least about customer satisfaction. Worst budget airline experience at non budget airline pricing.

### "worst company i ever use"
Athens to Tel Aviv. What a horrible experience with this lousy company, the worst company i ever use. Our flight supposed to take place on 16/7 at 17:15. Tt been delayed to 8pm, then 9pm then 10pm. We got offered to stay overnight in Athens due to small aircraft been sent instead of big one with free hotel and compensation of 250 euro which been promised to get within one week. 1 month later we still didn't get any compensation and the communication with the airline is really impossible, the customer support over the phone cannot help, and sending repeated online forms - got no replies. Upon arrival - the security took the boarding pass for verification and never returned so we have no required documents for insurance company, the airline doesn't reply to forms sent, and there is no any alternative way to communicate with them unlike any other modern airline do not use their services! Their service is horrible and unprofessional , aircraft old and poorly maintained  bottom line, doesn't worth to even think to fly with El Al!

### "The food was very tasty"
Tel Aviv to Prague. Flew with them not for the first time, and not for the last time. Security maybe disturbing, but it's their job. Crew was great, In the cruise I was invited to enter the cockpit. The food was very tasty.

### "is the worse airline"
Mumbai to London via Tel Aviv. This airline is the worse airline I have traveled. They'll check you so much that while boarding you loose the enthusiasm of traveling anywhere. They'll check your checked in baggage in a horrible way and your purses and other handbags they'll completely ruin it. They ruined my expensive bag, broke the zips completely when as instructed I kept my bag unlocked. I was travelling in a group. They lost the baggage of one of my colleagues and it came after 3 days. The flight was also late. If you get this airline at a cheap rate please skip it, you'll save yourself and your baggage. I can't understand that Israel is so modern in terms of technology, they hardly don't know how checking is done in a less ruthless way.

### "Absolutely uncomfortable"
New York to Tel Aviv. Horrible way to board, unnecessary questions by some so called security. Staff doesn't speak proper English. Just here to create troubles. They don't scan your passport for details, but will ask silly personal questions, and personal details. They want your checked in baggage not locked, and remove your stuff for screening without your presence. I travelled with my husband for vacations, but made a huge mistake of booking El Al. I will never  fly with them ever again. Absolutely uncomfortable and mentally traumatic experience.

### "experience was great"
Tel Aviv to Bucharest. Boarding began on time. The crew was nice and helpful. I flew on the memorial so the movies were related to it. Small water bottles served to all passengers at the beginning of the flight which was a very nice thing. the meal includes the choice between two types of sandwiches. The seat was extremely comfortable and I had plenty of leg room (I'm 185 CM). Overall experience was great!

### "could not fault the service"
This was my first time on El Al's 787 in Premium Economy, a modern version of what Business was when it was introduced over thirty years ago. The seat was very comfortable, there was plenty of leg room, the video screen was large and very responsive and there was a good selection of movies. The seat had a pop up footrest but I didn't use it as I always find them particularly useless. I fly quite a lot and am sick of the regular meals served on all the airlines so I ordered a Vegan (VGML) meal. It was very nicely presented and was delicious. My husband joined me on the return flight and chose the fish (there were three main course options) and also said it was delicious. There were regular cabin patrols by the cabin crew who were very friendly. We could not fault the service. Outstanding flights. El Al was never my first choice of airline but I would not hesitate in the future. Wifi was available but I didn't need to use it.

### "treated like dirt"
Athens to Tel Aviv. Worst airlines I have ever taken. Paid for an expensive flight to be treated like dirt. Flight delayed for 12 hours, baggage did not fly with me and was stuck in Athens for another 12 hours. They told me they will get it on the next flight (12 hours later) and immediately send it to my house but did not tell me when I can expect it. I reached Tel Aviv, tried to speak to EL AL office and waited 1 hour before getting turned away. Flight reached 12.20am, waited for nothing up till 2am. Tried to call customer service the next day but they had me on hold forever. One time, was on hold for 30 mins before I gave up. Called them hourly thereafter. Same thing. National airlines? Truly reflective of the state.

### "time to renovate the 777"
Tel Aviv to Mumbai. 2x3x2 configuration with an old business class- not a full flat bed and old school business class. entertainment was also old with very little option and poor quality. no WIFI. cabin crew was very good as always in ElAl - they are very professional kind and nice. food was poor due to Passover probably - Jewish holiday, this is not typical for elal. Overall its the time to renovate the 777 especially the business class.

### "absolutely disgusting experience"
I have been a loyal El Al member since 1993 (so has my entire family). Up until my very last flight, I have never had such issues with the staff and service and I may never fly with El Al again. Prior to booking my flight from Toronto to Tel Aviv, I called El Al office to ensure that I get an exit-row seat. The agent advised me that there are several emergency row seats available and seat number 45A is free. I booked the ticket online, selected that seat and got my confirmation email thinking everything is good to go, but it wasn't. Once I arrived at Toronto Airport, the  agent gave me my boarding pass with seat 45A, as they should have. However, in pre-boarding, they changed my seat to 28J (between people). I asked the reason why and the agent refused to answer! I asked for a supervisor, which informed me that 45A is a paid seat and the plane is full, therefore I will have to accept my 28J seat. I explained that I have a headache and I need a seat to be able to lean, as I have migraines from time to time. Please explain to me how this is acceptable, as my seat number was confirmed TWICE? After waiting for 15 minutes, the supervisor agreed to give me back my 45A seat. I proceeded onto the plane and after a short period of time, the supervisor came back onto the plane and kicked me out of my seat. When I asked the reason why, the supervisor said it's because of my migraine. What does my migraine have anything to do with my original seat number? The reason why I got a migraine in the first place, is because of your beyond unprofessional staff members and their horrible service. This was an absolutely disgusting experience flying with El Al and it could have all been avoided if staff just honored my original seat number and listened to me.

### "Did not like the entertainment"
Amsterdam to Tel Aviv. We were at the airport 3 hours early but security took only a few minutes maybe because we are 71 year old Americans. Very polite and friendly hosts. Did not like the entertainment which was stripped down for a brand new plane. Overhead movie or use your device. Decent legroom. Food was the pits. Seats comfortable. Took 2 flights both of which left late but arrived early. Did not like how little luggage we could bring!

### "friendly cabin crew"
Tel Aviv to Athens with El Al Israel Airlines. Wonderful flight, friendly cabin crew, departed and landed on time. The airplane was clean and comfortable. Food was nice and fitted to the route length.

### "phones were never answered"
Not Verified |  London to Tel Aviv. Flight was fine. On flight staff could be more friendly. Biggest complaint is the total absence of telephone or email customer service. I sent an email to try to recover my matmid number . I was told to send copy of my passport etc, which I did. Just two weeks later I get an email telling me that the email I used was only for unsubscribing, and I should phone customer service. Needless to say the phones were never answered. I have switched to British airways and get superb service.

### "never fly El Al again"
Tel Aviv to New York. My wife and I arrived at the El Al Business desk for check-in. They tried to downgrade us due to business class being overbooked. No prior text, email or call warning. No offer of any compensation. We complained loudly. They then offered us a free biz ticket but we wanted our reserved seats (reserved many months ago). Disgusting yelling ensued destroying in five minute what had been a wonderful three weeks in Israel. We will never fly El Al again. They were extremely unprofessional, disrespectful to our rights and should just close shop.

### "service not equal to price"
New York to Tel Aviv. We were served one meal (breakfast) on both flights. Food was horrible! Coffee lukewarm and no good bread left. We were never offered cocktails or snacks and service not equal to price we paid for airline tickets. Would not recommend this airline. Lounges in NY and Tel Aviv left a lot to be desired

### "super professional and nice"
London Heathrow to Tel Aviv with El Al Israel Airlines. New 787 with excellent Business class 1x2x1 configuration. The new menu is more like Asian food with a touch of Israeli tastes - very interesting and good. Crew team are super professional and nice. Free wifi works well.

### "terrible, very old airplane"
I had a flight from Milan to Tel Aviv with them. After seeing my American passport and asking some personal questions, they took me to check in and changed my exit seat that I paid for so now I'm sitting on the very last seat in this terrible, very old airplane. They also told me to arrive early at the gate because there will be extra security check before boarding. Their "security check" was the most embarrassing thing that could happen to anyone. I will never suggest it to anyone.

### "it's miserly. Awful"
Not Verified |  New York JFK to Tel Aviv. Worst airline I have ever flown. Terrible food, and good luck getting drinks because the airline is cheap and only offered drinks twice on an over 10 hour flight. And the airline staff? They are the rudest people I have ever encountered! Shame on them! When the plane landed, some passengers got out of their seats while we were still moving on the tarmac. The Captain came on over the intercom and told people to remain in their seats, but they didn't listen and continued to remove their luggage from the overhead compartments while we were heading to the gate. Where was the flight staff? Absolutely no where to be found. This is my second time visiting Israel. The last time I flew United. Same price, wonderful airline. I thought it might be fun to fly on an Israeli airline this time. Big mistake. Bad food, broken down, archaic airline, rude staff and I am so embarrassed I flew this airline with my friend. I could have flown United and had a wonderful flight. This airline isn't just cheap, it's miserly. Awful.

### "won’t fly with them again"
London to Tel Aviv. Rude and hostile cabin crew who behaved differently depending on whether you are Jewish or not. As I am not they were quite nasty to me. I definitely won’t fly with them again.

### "there is lack of professionalism"
Mumbai to Tel Aviv. When I entered the airport (3 hours before boarding) there was a long queue to check in the bags and I had no idea about pre security checks of El Al before issuing boarding pass. There were many Israeli citizens behind me in the queue but they were called before us for pre security and issued boarding pass before people like me ie Indians. This type of discrimination by the airline security staff should not be done and made me upset. The security asked me lots of questions which I answered to their satisfaction and to be honest I was never questioned so much in my entire life. Also just before boarding my all carry on items were opened and checked by the same security. During the flight the usb plug points were not working. Seating and food served was good and to the satisfaction. Just before landing in Tel Aviv the air hostess told me that my checked in bag has not been loaded on the plane and I’ll get the same within 24 hours. She informed me to collect the property irregularity report from lost & found at Tel Aviv and assured me twice that I’ll receive my checked in bag within 24 hours at my hotel in Tel Aviv. It has been two days that my baggage has not arrived and as per the customer care of El Al my baggage is still in Mumbai. My entire vacation in Israel is ruined because all my winter clothing / shoes is in my checked in bag. The airline is providing me a mere compensation of $100 to buy clothes for entire trip. This entire time I had to follow up with airline again and again, there is no communication from their end which surprises me. I’m still waiting for my baggage and I hope airline takes this seriously. Very disappointed with the so called national airline and there is lack of professionalism.

### "Service was very good"
Tel Aviv to New York JFK. Boeing 747-400 is an old plane but there is no other experience like the upper deck. Seat layout is 2X2 with old version of flat bed. Service was very good, food was good and overall experience was ok. No WiFi and very old entertainment system as its old aircraft.

### "WiFi worked well"
Milan to Tel Aviv. Good European Business class with separate cabin and full business service. 16 Seats in configuration of 2x2. Air crew was  professional, nice and welcome, food was good. WiFi worked well and it was free.

### "enjoy being terrible people"
Flying with El Al is unpleasant every time. From preboarding to on flight service, it is not about customer service. It is about safety ( good thing , but it doesn't mean you have to sacrifice being a nice person). I choose El Al because of the direct flights from Los Angeles. I cannot stand the employees, almost all are unpleasant to interact with. They seem like they enjoy being terrible people.

### "Ridiculous, non-professional, rude"
I'm a Brazilian, I already visited Israel flying with Aeroflot. The day before yesterday I bought business class for the flight from Vienna to Tel Aviv. During check-in (I was one of the first to make check-in) procedure I was informed my luggage gonna go in another airplane and come later. I need to show my phone, search my name in google and explain why I bought a ticket at the same day as the flight is, why my flight was booked from the Russian travel agency (my wife is Russian so she used to book for me tickets for the last 6 years - nobody ever asked it). Despite I booked business class I am allowed travel  only in economy class. When I refused and ask to give me any document where will be written that they dont allow me to travel - they refused - saying that they allow and that I am refusing. I asked to write that they offered me to travel in economy instead of business and I refused - They said that they cannot give me anything because they dont need explain the security reasons. After me insisting and calling to the agency - they asked airport security to check cameras of the airport and check what I was doing before approach check-in. Of course my luggage was checked 3 times. I felt myself like a suspect to be a terrorist or something like this, despite the fact that I have 1000-s of stamps from all over the world - yes there 2 stamps from Emirates - but even if it could be because of them - its not the representative of the airlines who decide to allow the entrance to the country- and this stamps are old - after this I already visited Israel. Ridiculous, non-professional, rude - worst service I ever saw in my life.

### "service was very friendly"
Tel Aviv to Toronto. Fantastic timing, being a night flight and arriving early morning. Excellent king David lounge in Tel Aviv. Lounge in Toronto is shared with KLM, which is a little lousy. Inflight service was very friendly. in a couple of months the Boeing 787  will be in service for this route.

### "very nice business class"
London to Tel Aviv. Fresh new Boeing 787-9 with very nice business class, seat configuration is 1x2x1. Seat is very conformable with wide screen and very good entertainment system. Kit was nice with Ferragamo brand kit. The seats is isolated with direct access to aisle. Team was very good and professional.

### "This is unacceptable service"
Sofia to Tel Aviv. I haven't experienced such a poor customer service so far. During the security screening process I received completely unprofessional treatment, this person was asking me questions and after each question was leaving me alone and was going to consult his supervisor for further steps. Therefore the procedure was very long and humiliating. I was travelling with 4 friends for holidays from Sofia to Israel on 2nd of November 2018 Friday with a flight LY0552 at 11:55. After the admission interviews we have checked-in together, therefore the company representative who attended us checked my luggage under the name of one of my friends by mistake. So basically my luggage was registered under the name of Nikoleta Boerikova. Prior the boarding the security informed my friend Nikoleta that they have removed few items from her bag for further checks and they were going to send her the stuff in a separate box once we would arrive on the airport in Israel . We have arrived on the Ben Gurion  Airport around 14:20 and we didn't receive any box with the missing items. Nikoleta claimed the missing box thinking that this was part of her luggage(Attached the number of the report filled on the airport ). After we have left the airport and went to the hotel. As soon as I arrived in the hotel I have noticed that all my cosmetics , perfume Bulgari and black swimming suit were missing from my luggage and immediately realized that the removed items were from my luggage not from Nikoleta's one. Respectively we have noticed that on my luggage there was a sticker with the name of Nikoleta Boerikova and on her briefcase there was my name instead. During my vacations I had no cosmetics and no swimming suit because they have removed the most important things for a traveling person on vacations and on top of everything you have registered my luggage under the name of another person. I have claimed the missing items 1 week ago and still pending at least an answer! I am extremely disappointed! This is unacceptable service.

### "I don't recommend El Al"
New York to Tel Aviv. I don't recommend El Al to anyone, the service is really bad. They broke my bag and there is no one to whom to talk too.

### "Service was excellent"
We just flew business, seats 2C&D on one of the new Boeing 787-9 Dreamliners and were extremely happy. Service was excellent. Lie flat seats excellent. VOD although not as good as Singapore Airlines nonetheless was very good. We've flown Singapore Airlines many times and El Al much to their credit has upped their game substantially and is on their way towards being a top 50 or even top 20 airlines! Food was delicious. El Al has ordered a total of 18 Dreamliners and as these become available the reviews will soar. The last time we flew on El Al was 10 years ago and at that time it was awful. Great to see it's turned it around big time! Boarding at JFK was unorganized and a joke. Boarding at Ben Gurion airport was smooth!

### "caused stressful environment"
Not Verified |  12 hour flight delay due to cabin crew strike. Had we been informed early enough we would have stayed in Barcelona. We were not allowed out of the airport. Limited food, blankets, pillows were available. Angry emotions caused stressful environment. We lost a big chunk of time on our 1st visit to Israel. We have made numerous attempts to connect with customer support to obtain recompense for the loss. We were hoping to get this taken care of while still in the country. We have received no word in regard to this matter. We were approached by several disgruntled passengers who were filing a lawsuit with EL Al as they said “this happens all of the time” Hopefully, we are contacted soon in regard to restitution.

### "seats are nice and comfortable"
Tel Aviv to Barcelona. This is the new flagship of El Al, replacing aircraft like the 767 and 747. the configuration is 3x3x3 and the seats are nice and comfortable. Entertainment systems is very good with a wide screen and the basic WIFI is free. service was very good.

### "lack of information"
Tel Aviv to Luton. The crew were not informative in the slightest. My flight was delayed an hour which is an inconvenience but not their fault. The reason I was annoyed is due to the lack of information and updates we (the passengers) received. No one told us that we were delayed, why we were delayed, there was no approximation of when we were going to take off and additionally I even asked a member of staff why we were delayed and that person response was that she didn’t know and will ask. She never got back to me. The next Inconvenience was the temperature of the airplane. As a passenger you had no control of the air con above you. They’re constantly blasting cold air on you the entire flight (which isn’t ideal when you have a sore throat). Again I asked why the air con has to be so high as I felt that it was unhealthy. A crew member said they would ask and get back to me and they never got back to me. Finally, while a stewardess was bringing round a trolley of soft drinks, I asked if there’s any tea available (as the air con was affecting my sore throat). She said that she’d come back and bring me some once she’d finished serving everyone. As you’d expect, no tea was brought to me. Thankfully soon after the flight landed, clapping ensued by I did not participate due to the poor quality in service throughout the flight. Ultimately I wouldn’t recommend flying with with El Al and will not be flying with them myself. Which is a shame as I want to support Israli companies but I just can’t overlook their incompetence. Other minor inconveniences which may be exclusive to my flight/plane: -No phone charger socket -They removed the wifi bundles which they had on my previous flight a few weeks ago. Furthermore,In order to access their entertainment system you need to have already downloaded their app (so they can use and sell your data for money). The main inconvenience with this was that I wasn’t informed about the app prior to my flight. I hope they take my feedback and criticism seriously and make the necessary changes to the training of their staff as well as their planes.

### "Service was very good and professional"
2x3x2 configuration in the 777. Overall the aircraft looks ok, not the newest in the industry but OK. Entertainment system is a bit old but ok. Full flat bed but not the newest version and without privacy or cabin as we used to see in newest business class in the industry. Service was very good and professional. 2 meals served. 1 after take off - hot meal and breakfast before landing in Tel Aviv. Didn't try dinner but breakfast was good and above avg. I saw on the El Al web site they will change the aircraft soon to new 787-900 and this is a good news.

### "Worst flight ever"
Prague to Tel Aviv. Horrible service. Provided them wil all the security details needed including: place of work, cards, IDs, certifications and they still had us investigated as if we were terrorists. They came back with new questions all the time and still after all questioning was done we had to wait and wait for too long. Our bags were opened and our dirty clothes and shoes were put took out of their bags and put on the clean ones. Worst flight ever. A nightmare!

### "experience on the 787 was great"
Not Verified |  Newark to Tel Aviv in June 2018 and return in August 2018 on the Boeing 787. Check-in at EWR was smooth after the compulsory security interrogation (I strongly recommended one arrives 3+ hours if flying El Al in order to complete the check-in process). My interrogation lasted 10 minutes and it helped I was traveling with a group to Israel. Everything on the plane both ways looked brand new and the IFE was fantastic and state-of-the-art. Flight attendants were friendly and attentive and responded quickly to call button requests. Food (two meals) on both flights were edible and alright (chose the chicken dish on both legs and it was alright). Dairy/"breakfast" meal was a choice of blintzes or an omelet on both flights as well. Chose the blintzes both times - they were nothing special but I was full from the previous meal. Check-in at Tel Aviv once past the initial security interrogation was fairly quick. My seat was assigned at the gate although they termed it as "standby," which makes me wonder if they didn't expect me to be on the plane due to extra security searches of my bags? I can only guess that. At the TLV gate, approached the desk to get a seat assignment as the flight was boarding. The first lady I approached hardly looked at the computer and my ticket and said: "it wasn't ready. I waited 15 minutes and without any announcement coming about "standby" passengers, I approached a different gate agent who promptly assigned me a seat. They could not fulfill my request for an aisle seat but the gate agent was gracious with his apology. On the return flight, I was seated next to an unaccompanied minor and the flight attendant was very attentive toward him, asking how he was and if he needed anything during the flight. El Al does have online check-in but it's useless if you are checking bags or have to go through extra security procedures. Overall, however the experience on the 787 was great and I did not mind the extra security situations that come with flying El Al. That said, I'm not sure if I'd want to fly on them on some of the older aircraft.

### "treats passengers like terrorists"
Tel Aviv to Vienna. The worst airline in the world; It is one thing to take security seriously, but to refuse to answer simple and righteous questions to why I am receiving an extra security check, violates my rights as a passenger and only suggests that staff, working for this airline, act extremely unprofessional and treat their passengers with absolutely zero human decency and respect. A passenger like myself, who has no history whatsoever, which could suggest a potential threat, deserves to be heard out, especially when the two companions, one of whom is my boyfriend, did not receive any kind of extra security checks. This airline treats their passengers like terrorists, without having any hint or evidence of any wrongdoing or criminal history. If you can avoid traveling with this airline, I would highly suggest you do so. This airline calls themselves safe and professional, but none of these values are taken into consideration.

### "business class is not up-to-date"
Tel Aviv to London. Wide body aircraft for 5hr flight. Business class with flat seat configuration 2x3x2. The business class is not up-to-date and entertainment is old. no real privacy but overall ok. Service and air crew very very good, professional and high standards . Overall ElAl business class deserve a high rank.

### "Service was very good"
Luton to Tel Aviv. Full business service in 2x2x2 configuration with full flat bed. The 767 is not young but overall kept clean and in high standard maintenance. Entertainment is very old but the team offer Ipad. Service was very good, and the ElAl business team found to be professional nice and welcoming.

### "direct from Los Angeles"
El Al is the only airline that flies direct from Los Angeles to Tel Aviv. This is the only reason i fly with them since their equipment was old and broken. We fly business and we never got a comfortable seat (none is 180 degree flat), they are very old and do not work properly. The crew admits to these issues but nothing is done. We took many flights with El Al in the past, but no more. We will wait for the competition to bring the newer A/C (787?!) and lower the outrageous price that El Al charges when there is no competition.

### "Professional, nice, calm, quick"
Flew El Al Israel Airlines from Milan, Italy to Tel Aviv. Old aircraft but good maintenance. Full business class with flat bad for 4H flight, excellent food and the best cabin crew I have met in the last 10 years. Professional, nice, calm, quick – best in class. Overall super nice flight thanks to the air crew.

### "your act together and be competitive"
I am a frequent flyer, I travel about 40 weeks a year. Using many companies from Virgin Atlantic to BA to others, London is a major hub after all. It's been many years since I've taken a flight with El Al. See I am originally Israeli and take pride in all things from Israel, but this one even my best selling skills cannot spinoff. El Al is charging 900 pounds for a flight from Johannesburg to Tel Aviv (I do LND to JNB every two weeks) which is 9 hours duration, they use a plane from the 80s that is so dated in its seats, décor and electrical (no USB ports or electric plugs) and no entertainment device for an 9 hours flight (thanks for helping me to focus on my work more). If I've had any other direct flight I would simply not choose to fly El Al. In short I'd say get your act together and be competitive, if more companies would fly to TLV you would simply go out of business.

### "The food is inedible"
Flew Paris to Tel Aviv. Check in located at the poorest part of CDG at 2A far from the gates and security. King David lounge is no more than poor, embarrassing, old and spartanice. The food is inedible. The 737-900 configuration is 2x2 with full business service but do not expect a full bed like in the 787 or 777 that El Al operate. The Air crew were very good as usual – that’s the best part of El Al, although issues with hand luggage - the aircraft was full and ground team were very soft - this causes 30 min delays as they had to take down lots of luggage from the cabin.

### "super professional and nice team"
Flew Tel Aviv to Rome. Flying business in single aisle aircraft in Europe is usually getting the same seats but without the middle seat occupied. On El Al you get 2x2 configuration with nice business seats and full business service. The seats are hard and manual but its dramatically better vs other options. The service on this flight was nothing beside perfect. Warm welcome, super professional and nice team. Really can be a top service in any airline.

### "No lounge for business class"
Munich to Tel Aviv. We can even start before explaining the check in and security process for El AL in Munich, which is the most complicated and unfriendly. Its start in Terminal 1 (the old one in the Airport), then goes to check in K. this check is located after the parking area. At the beginning you think you are lost. But that’s the direction. Then you arrive to the separated terminal dedicated to ElAl. No lounge for business class, slow check in and security, no shops or proper drinks (small kiosk with basic things). Flight with a friendly and professional air crew but who will remember that after the long long way to this terrible terminal.

### "El Al has the worst service"
I have never been that much disappointed at a flight company. El Al has the worst service, worst meals, and worst manners i have never seen. I flew from Newark to Tel Aviv on the 28/12/2017 on the flight that is supposed to take off at 19h45. Although I booked 2 tickets when made the reservation, I was not even sitting next to my fiance. We asked to have the places changed, and a  rude lady told me the flight was full and she could not do anything for us, then when boarding she actually changed my fiance's seat to a more far away place. Once in the airplane, we discovered all seats were mixed up and everyone was trying to change seats and it was a big mess, we had more than an hour delay on the aircraft because people were being off boarded and their luggage needed to be found in the hold. We could not sleep in the plane because everyone was standing and even before we land the captain was begging the passengers to seat because they were already waiting with their suitcases. Last surprise was finding my luggage broken with things missing and my padlock disappeared with the zip. When going to the claiming counter at the airport, the lady told me that the zip was not included in the insurance, and she could not do anything for me.

### "value for money"
Tel Aviv to Johannesburg. Fantastic service, as a gold member, speedy check in, brilliant King David lounge at TLV, with much choice. Roomy, comfortable seat, punctual flight, good service. Staff were friendly and helpful, food excellent. Excellent value for money. Only drawback that the plane is old, but it was very clean, and was kept tidy during the flight.

### "will never use services from El Al"
Boston to Tel Aviv. I will never use services from El Al and I won't recommend this company to anyone. On my way back home from Tel Aviv to Boston our flight was delayed 6 hours. We had to spend all night on the floor with a 10 month old baby. I was told by the company that we were going to compensated but it's been 4 months and I didn't even receive an apology. Very unprofessional!

### "they treated me horribly"
Boston to Tel Aviv. When checking I was the 5th one in line to get my boarding pass and pass through security I understand you get questioned for security purposes but I was standing for 2 hours getting questioned one after another that’s all because on my US passport it said My nationality said I’m Kazakhstan - they treated me horribly and were so rude and made a huge problem on why I’m flying from Boston and not New York. I honestly don’t see why you can treat an innocent person like this! So finally I pass security after 2hrs of being questioned and got in line to get on airplane. So while boarding they asked me to come aside and into this security room and I asked the guy if there was a problem he rudely replied yes we do have a problem and told me I was supposed to be here at 730 and shut the door. I was never told to go anywhere after waiting for so long - in security room they check my bag and asked to check me id. So when I finally arrive to Israel when. Walk-in out after I had my luggage they made me walk through security all over again nothing was upsetting as this you have ruined my whole trip made it stressful to come to Israel and fly back home, how much tears I have shed to just come visit my sister who had been living in Israel since 2012 and see my friend on her wedding day.

### "good part was the cabin crew"
Paris CDG to Tel Aviv, leaving CDG at 22:30. The boarding was a mess as unfortunately it happened many time in El Al. It started late, no clear row for Business vs Economy, no priority for business or seats location, boarding all the aircraft in one call including wheelchairs. Security after gate and right before the aircraft was a mess as well. The good part was the cabin crew (professional with very good service at business) and the full flat bed in the aircraft for this night flight.

### "so many technical problems in one flight"
I love the 767 as its not super big and for sure offers a better flight experience than the 737 all versions El Al offer to Paris. The economy is 2x3x2 so the windows seats are preferred by far from the middle one. I choose Economy + which offers a few more cm in space and a welcome kit including a bottle of water, basic amenity kit and basically that’s it. Same seats and same food as economy. The aircraft looked ok and yes we know it's an old one but first impression was ok. Then came the second impression. Many technical problems with the entertainment system during the flight so basically after 3-4 times the crew reset the system, they told us – we will not have sound today during the flight and we are sorry. In addition the reading lights were on all flight as they couldn't turn it off. The crew were ok and nice, but so many technical problems in one flight was not easy for them as well.

### "Service was superb"
I flew business class to fly the night flight from Milan to Tel Aviv with El Al Israel Airlines. It leaves Milan at 23.00 and arrive at 04.00am, for those hours I don’t see any other option than the business class. The 7373-900 ER is a new aircraft with free WIFI built in and the entertainment system also uses internal wifi – Dream Stream. The seats are 2X2 =as domestic business seats – better that what other European airlines offer. The seat is hard but still not a real business class seat. Service was superb and very nice crew.

### "if possible, never again"
Amsterdam to Tel Aviv. My 2nd consecutive flight with EL AL, if possible, never again. EL AL 'Lost & Found' at Ben Gurion airport is ONLY interested in getting the customers out of the way as quickly as possible; that was my experience both times. They don't listen to the customer's requests or details. This 2nd time I didn't even get a toothbrush. I had to explain that my luggage would arrive on the next flight (see explanation further below), I told the assistant 3 times and only then did she bother to check her system. 1st flight to Israel with EL AL: I explained my travel schedule but they took the luggage to my 2nd address, therefore I didn't see it for 3 days until I arrived. They told me they would call beforehand, they never did. When I called them the day after my arrival, they said it was already with a driver who was already in the North. 2nd flight to Israel with EL AL: Whilst flying, the stewardess told me beforehand that my luggage would arrive with the following flight (I was 1 of the first people to check in!). I was requested to go straight to Lost & Found after clearing customs. This time I only gave them the address in Tel Mond where I would be staying first. I told the assistant at Lost & Found where I would be staying AND I showed her the exact address on my phone (it was typed). The following day I called Lost & Found. The girl on the phone was in a hurry and she said that the driver would call me. I had to tell her 3 times to slow down and please listen. I wanted to double-check the delivery address, then she insisted that I was staying in Tel Aviv and not Tel Mond. I had to convince her that was not true. She then gave me the courier's telephone number upon my request and just before she hung up, I double-checked the address again. Only then did she notice that she gave me a number for the Tel Aviv courier. I was put on hold twice, then I got a different number; unfortunately, that courier told me he wasn't working. I called Lost & Found again to explain; a different girl (this time) also insisted that my address was in Tel Aviv. The previous customer assistant didn't change the information in the EL AL system. She connected me to the previous assistant, again I was put on hold, then I got the correct number. Regarding luggage: if you don't pro-actively chase up EL AL, then things will almost certainly go wrong.

### "keeps real business class"
Tel Aviv to Milan. El Al's Boeing 737-900ER are the most modern model before the 737MAX that are now being delivered to airlines (not to ELAL yet). Not too much to expect from 737 offer and narrow body type but EL Al keeps real business class with nice service for pan European flights. The seat configuration is 2x2 and the service is good.

### "Seats were tightly spaced"
Flight from New York JFK to Tel Aviv was on an aged 747 configured for medium haul, not a 8 hr trip. Seats were tightly spaced with seats that didn’t recline well. Inflight entertainment was like flying 15 yrs ago. Certain channels played specific movies, no individual choices. Avoid flying with El Al if the route uses 747s. Friends flew with El Al but from Newark to Tel Aviv. Completely different experience as they flew on a brand new 787.

### "lousy ground service"
Lucky the travel agent kept seats for us in advance because the online check-in is really not good on El Al. They don't even give you the choice to pay for a better seat or to upgrade with an additional cost. Lucky we have Israeli passports, so the security check in Luton was fine. Non-Israeli passport holders are subject to harsh security questioning. There was a delay in boarding – more than an hour. The monitors at the terminal kept showing that everything is on time – bad joke. We were sitting at the gate, I was looking for an electricity point to charge my phone, so asked the guy at the gate (not an El Al worker) if I can use the electricity point. He said "sure, it's just another ten minutes till they finish cleaning the plane". So I understood that the ground service company working for El Al at Luton, isn't really a good one. Makes sense, as Luton is a low-cost airport and El Al operates a regular full service commercial flight, bit of a clash between the two. After boarding, the captain announced that due to bad weather the flight was delayed. Really? It was hardly raining all that time. What bad weather was there? Took off 70 minutes late. Upon arrival at Tel Aviv, about 50% of the passengers did not receive their luggage. Yes, approx. 50% of the passengers on the flight. We were told that due to bad weather the luggage could not be loaded on the plane. Again, really? Come on, flights take off when snowing. A few drops of regular, normal English rain can't to that bad to a flight procedure. Just admit that you have a lousy ground service company and that you don't really care about your clients! Friday morning the lost luggage claim was opened. Till now, Saturday night, almost 48 hours later, the tracking website shows "still tracing luggage", the El Al representatives on the phones tell you a different story each time you call. To conclude – last time I flew with El Al was 5 years ago. Now I know why. There are better options at better prices and at better service.

### "Could not have asked for more"
Luton to Tel Aviv will count among my top 3 First Class trips. Everything was provided. Courtesy car arrived at the promised time, met at airport by a porter who took me and my luggage to El Al Security and Check in, then he took me and my cabin baggage to Priority security. The lounge was quiet and ample Kosher Food was available. Priority boarding to plane, small but perfect First Class cabin, wonderful service from the Cabin Crew. Was loaned Bose earphones to listen to inflight music. Fresh and ample breakfast served on china with proper cutlery. Seat reclined to flat bed. Met at door of plane and escorted through Immigration and Customs, taken to courtesy car and driven home. Could not have asked for more.

### "Overall, it is a smooth flight"
Check each passenger thoroughly before check-in. From Hong Kong to Tel Aviv took around eleven and a half hours. Flight attendants are very nice to satisfy passenger's request. Moreover, the Kosher meal taste is beyond my expectation and it is very delicious. Overall, it is a smooth flight. I'll definitely travel with El Al if I have a chance to go to Israel again!

### "business class seats are 2x2 manual"
Tel Aviv to Milan. The Boeing 737-800 is the oldest version as El Al is replacing it with the 900ER The business class seats are 2x2 manual and faraway from a bed position. Anyhow this is a very good service within Europe. Watch out for row 10 (the first) as the leg room is not good due to the galley wall.

### "I was happy to find the 767"
Milan to Tel Aviv. I was happy to find the 767 in the route usually El Al used the 737-800. The 767 is old but it is clean and have the entertainment system called dream stream - you need to download the APP before the flight or you will get an IPad in business class with the app already there. Seats are 2x2x2 with the old version as it used to be standard in the industry 5-8 years ago. Service was super, great crew with professional pursuer, dinner was great - salad, main course, and deserts. Overall one of the best flight I had in the last year.

### "El Al do not take care of business class passengers"
Flew Venice to Tel Aviv. Boarding was on time from gate 19. Upon arrival the air crew welcome was very nice. El Al offer real business class with 2x2 configuration, full business service and meals. The 737-800 is the old version of the El Al short - Mid distance aircrafts. Most of the 737 they have are 900ER, the 800 is mostly for the low cost "UP" airline by El Al. Well, looking at the 737-800, the aircraft was old and needs proper refurbishment. Seats are very tough and hard and upper sides of the seat have seen better days. No WIFI and no proper entertainment system – headline group screens. Arrival to Tel Aviv the plane directed to out of the terminal parking and used the bus to the luggage and passport control, unfortunately El Al do not take care of business class passengers with dedicated van or transportation so the moment you leave the aircraft they treat you like an Economy class passenger.

### "full business service"
Check in at Business class was fast and warm, than visiting the King David lounge that is ok, and even below average if you consider it ad the home lounge of El Al. Boarding was exactly on time with a warm welcome of the crew. El AL operate "real" business class in those single aisle aircraft meaning 2+2 and about 150* titled with full business service - separated from the economy with full service. Right after take off the team close the windows shade (we left 0530 AM) in order to give us a proper sleep. Breakfast was served about 1.5 h before arrive to Venice, I ordered fruit plate and it was good and fresh. The variety was good include melon, kiwi and pineapple.

### "the team were nice and welcoming"
Flew Athens to Tel Aviv. Check in started 20 min late, upon arrival to the jet the team were nice and welcoming. This new 737-9 looks nice although I hate this narrow body aircraft. Nice blue coloring for economy and grey in business. Seats are ok and complimentary WIFI is great. Even for a short flight we received a small sandwich and drinks.

### "it had a low price"
Tel Aviv to Amsterdam, thy flight was late by a hour. After take off, the cabin crew served food to random people around the cabin, they just had no order. The cabin crew itself wasn't good, very impatient and unfriendly. The food itself was no more then fine, and the old IFE didn't even work. I slept most of the flight so I don't know what happend after the food. So  flying El Al is okay if you don't expect a lot and I'll recommend it because it had a low price.

### "Had the worst experience"
Had the worst experience flying with El-Al from Paris to Tel Aviv. Repeatedly questioned by 4 different officers. Provided them with all the documents to satisfy them, still they confiscated my passport and cellphone. Was escorted for full body pat down and forced to stay under the vigilance of the officers till the time I boarded the flight. If you are a Non-Israeli national be sure to be treated badly with El Al.

### "I won't be flying El Al again"
Tel Aviv to Luton. Pretty appalling everything! Staff were unfriendly and uncommunicative. Our flight was very bumpy and the captain kept putting on the seat belt sign - but not once did cabin crew come round to see if we had complied. And nor did they come round with water during the flight. Very poor! The flight was 30 mins late departing, with no explanation or apology. But at least it was bettter than the outbound flight which was 50 minutes late departing - again with no explanation. Food was bland and unappetising - very poor. Movies were acccesed on this aircraft on your own tablet (note - you have to download the El Al Dreamstream app before you fly) - but the movies were mainly pretty old. I won't be flying El Al again.

### "I will never fly El Al again"
I flew the same airplane both directions to Tel Aviv and return to Los Angeles. I recommend this flight. It is better than having a layover. My trip to Tel Aviv almost made me change my opinion which had previously been based on several previous horrible experiences on El Al. Trying to reach El Al by phone or even email is terribly difficult! I was trying to get signed up for Frequent flyer miles before the flight (the website didn't work) and I could reach no one. So back to the flight - the flight over was pretty good. The seat was the most comfortable I had ever had on El Al. The flight back, I paid an extra $150 for a seat with more leg room and more angle on the leaning back of the seat. The lady in front of me truly had more leg room and truly had more leaning back on her seat. In fact, hers worked so well, her seat back was pressed against my knees the whole flight and the lady also didn't want anyone touching her seat and let me know about it. Anyway, I paid extra for a better seat and it was less comfortable than the seat I was in going over that was just a normal seat. The movie, game, and watch where you are in the flight thing was out of order for the whole plane! There's more to the story, but this is enough. I can't get in touch with Customer Service. They asked for my opinion in a survey and I gave it, they did not respond to the reply that reported my dissatisfaction with the flight. It was a long 14 hour flight! And that woman kept her seat back until we landed! I can say the staff in the airports has improved their performance. I have been flying to Israel regularly for 27 years. The staff courtesy in the air has also greatly improved. The cleanliness of the bathrooms is remarkable, as they used to be filthy. I have said it before but really, I will never fly El Al again. You would think a country as technologically advanced as Israel could come up with some good customer service.

### "One of the worst airlines"
Tel Aviv to Hong Kong. One of the worst airlines I've flown. Staff is rude, not helpful and unapologetic. Interior of the plane looked old, dirty and broken in some places. Entertainment system stuck in the '90s. Our whole row's entertainment system was broken, after 2 hours of flying and numerous attempts to notify staff (looked like I had to apologise for bothering them) we were given 3 ipads for 5 people. No sorry or  apology - nothing. Anyone should be crazy to fly a second time with them, or a first. Do yourself a favour and choose a different airline.

### "made me feel very welcome onboard"
Tel Aviv to Zurich. The check-in was very pleasant. The lady took great lengths to tell me I did not need to check-in my bag and could take it on board. I proceeded through the rigorous Ben Gurion Security control. I expected extra special security for EL AL but it was the same as for other airlines. The seat pitch was comfortable and better than Swiss. There was no in seat entertainment. Breakfast was served with a choice. I chose the omelette that was delicious. The flight arrived on time. I hope to fly EL AL again in the future, I felt EL AL made me feel very welcome onboard.

### "doubt we will fly El Al again"
In October I arranged a trip with El Al from Tel Aviv to Los Angeles for myself, my wife and my daughter (seven years old). I was to fly to LA at the beginning of November. My wife was to fly out on Thanksgiving with my daughter. My wife was then to return to Tel Aviv a week later, and I was to return to Tel Aviv at the end of December with my daughter. I had no complaints about my flight to LA in November, aside from the '90s vintage entertainment system with several channels of movies on loops. The plane was comfortable enough and clean, with relatively good food and no trouble with the service. Then, due to an internal dispute, El Al arbitrarily canceled the flight my wife and daughter were to take to Los Angeles, providing no solution whatsoever and destroying our plan. We were notified of the cancellation a few hours before the flight, when they were already packed and ready to leave, leaving little time to make other arrangements. We were on the phone for hours trying to reach El Al, but nobody answered. My wife and daughter were crushed and upset. To salvage the rest of the trip, I had to scramble to book alternate flights with United and had to spend several thousand dollars on alternate flights—way beyond the cost of the original flights. I had to rebook my own return flight with United instead of El Al because my daughter obviously can't fly alone. There was no other option but to cancel the trip and return home. El Al was nowhere to be found throughout this traumatic experience. It wasn't until several weeks later that we received a refund for my wife's and daughter's flights. El Al refused to offer any compensation of any kind for the trouble or distress caused, or the additional cost incurred. After a month and a half of wrangling with El Al's customer service, the only compensation offered was a partial credit for the return flight I could not use, which could only be used for a single ticket with El Al. El Al's management and personnel are apparently highly irresponsible and incompetent, putting their own internal disputes above customer service. I highly doubt we will ever fly with El Al again. **ASK TICKWT

### "cabin crew was friendly"
Zürich to Tel Aviv with El Al. I read lots of bad reviews about this airlines, but I must say I was pleasantly surprised by my flight. Staff in Zurich were really friendly, soufganyiots (donuts) were served to passengers in the boarding area, cabin crew was friendly, and food more than edible.

### "last time for me with El Al"
I took yesterday a flight from Tel Aviv to Hong Kong with El Al. The economy cabin seats are smaller than regular Economy on other airlines. The flight was late and no one appeared to care! The inflight entertainment system is terrible and from the 90s! My ticket cost:$2600, and this will be the last time for me with El Al.

### "ultimate low for service standards"
Tel Aviv to Brussels. As a frequent flyer of El Al, I've learned to deal with the sometimes outdated plane interior, long waiting lines at Ben Gurion Airport (both for check-in and security), delays and the absence of a proper inflight entertainment system on European flights. However on our last two flights with El Al, the cabin crew managed to reach an ultimate low for service standards. The night (early morning) flight from Tel Aviv to Brussels was packed with screaming kids and (praying) men, who hijacked the plane to turn it into one big playground. For 5 (early morning) hours we had to suffer from the constant aisle traffic, loud screaming and ultra-orthodox men and kids bumping into other passengers. Although El Al can't be blamed for screaming kids and annoying passengers, they should be able to cope with it. Unfortunately the crew decided not to act upon our (and others) requests to stop the mayhem. Even more so, the El Al crew encouraged the behaviour by announcing that everyone should get their drinks at the back of the plane, dramatically increasing the amount of aisle traffic and people bumping into us. For the rest of the flight the cabin crew did not visit passengers or provide any services to them. If you needed something you were to get it yourself from the back of the plane. Our flight back to Tel Aviv was much better, albeit that the flight attendants were particularly unfriendly and unorganized. When handing out meals, several rows were 'missed' and did not receive a meal. Apparently something went wrong with some of the meals. In the end we did not receive a meal. After notifying the crew, we got an unfriendly "there isn't any left". No alternatives were offered. Upon return home we filed a complaint with El Al as an opportunity to take away the bad feeling we were left with after the 2 dreadful flights and numerous service failures. Unfortunately El Al's customer service did not have the courtesy to contact us, despite several follow ups. It has now been over 5 weeks and I doubt we will ever hear from them. I do however know that we will not use El Al again. A company treating its customers in such an arrogant way is not worth my money.

### "questions are asked very unprofessionally"
Took this flight to go from Frankfurt to Tel Aviv in November 2016. Check in was efficient although the usual high security procedures. Check in staff very unfriendly. Seats were comfortable, food was good. The only thing that was really unpleasant was the mood and the friendliness of the cabin crew. No smile on their faces and questions are asked very unprofessionally. Instead of asking if I ordered a special meal they just said "what's your name, what's your name, your name". They obviously don't enjoy their work. Next this I will go with Lufthansa for a lot less money.

### "horrible experience"
Toronto to Tel Aviv with El Al Israel Airlines. Horrible experience. Booked a baby crib, triple checked crib was available for us and was assured it is. Got on the flight and the crib is taken "Because the plane got changed". Had a 6 month old baby on my lap for over 11 hours. Also, when I book an El-Al flight I expect to fly with El-Al plane and crew, and not some chartered falling apart plane. In 2016, inflight entertainment should be the norm, especially when EL-AL advertises it. Spanish crew were nice and food is decent.

### "cabin was overcrowded"
Flew from Amsterdam to Tel Aviv with El Al and will never fly with them again. The regular schedule flight has the lowest charter service levels. The cabin was overcrowded, with almost no leg space and narrow seats (I'm 60 kilos, not obese). Not enough space for luggage in cabin storage. The crew only did one cold beverage run. If you want tea or a second cup of water - you have to go to the stewardess and ask for it. Hard to judge about the entertainment, since no one offered headphones, even for a charge. Blankets are short in supply - first grabs first keeps. Only one pillow was detected. No seat swapping, not even for the obese disabled man stuck by my side (near the toilet). Security is good, but other companies offer it too. So, what's El-Al's excuse?

### "food was really good"
Tel Aviv to Amsterdam. We arrived at the airport at 2:00AM. We did electronic check-in which took 5 mins. We boarded the airplane at 5:00 and took off at 6:00. The seat was comfortable, and it had a headrest that you can lower, higher or fit to your head! After the takeoff we got beverages and 45 mins into the flight we got our food. You can choose your food when you purchase the ticket. The food was really good and IFE also great. You can download EL AL's app into your phone and watch movies, play games, see the map and even you can chat with other passengers without internet. (The planes has an internet connection). We landed at Amsterdam after a great flight.

### "the worst airline experience"
Tel Aviv to London Heathrow. Travelling with an infant yet no chance of securing a bulkhead seat and no seatbelt for the child. Shockingly bad value in premium economy. Nothing to separate it from standard economy: neglible leg room difference, still 3 seats in a row etc. Drinks service laughable: the only alcohol was red wine; no beer, no white wine, no spirits. Soft drinks served in little paper cups without ice. Check in was a nightmare of queuing for nearly 2 hours at the national airport to simply complete pre-check in security for the national airline. Israel should be ashamed. Quite honestly, from start to finish the worst airline experience I have ever had.

### "shocked at the quality"
Newark to Tel Aviv with El Al. Our first time to the Middle East. While not inexperienced travelers, we were shocked at the difference in quality and comfort of this airline. The seats were dirty, smelly and worn out. Once the meal service was over so was customer service. The flight was approximately 12 hrs long (extra tiring by anyone's standards). However, the flight could have been endurable had the lights in the cabin not been turned out, the tv not been broken with no help from cabin crew, refreshments been regularly offered, water would have been nice (I went in search of an attendant but no sightings), the bathrooms were disgusting with no one to report the problem to. The food - I understand the need to serve a kosher meal to those who require it but, we were a plane full of passengers that didn't require this. We were not given the choice. Who serves a hard roll cold with no butter? And sorry but, chopped salad for breakfast? Horrible. We were herded through the airport onto the plane and off again like cattle. The security questions were patent and a joke. If we are ever called to the Middle East again which I don't foresee, flying El Al will not even be considered. Flyers Beware.

### "terrible from start to finish"
Hong Kong to Tel Aviv. Terrible experience from start to finish. The cabin staff servicing our area of the plane were very rude and unattentive. Our row of seats and numeorus others were missed when handing out hot towels etc and the same also happened with breakfast as we had to ask for our meals. We were seated opposite a family who obviously worked for the airline and they received all of the attention, including seconds of meals before we'd even been serviced. Just before arrival I was told that my luggage did not make it onto the plane, even though they had been checked through from Sydney and there was a 3-hour stopover. The staff at Lost & Found at Tel Aviv airport were not helpful at all and very hard to communicate with. Was told to ring the airport again the next day to check progress on luggage but was only able to leave a message asking for a return call, which never happened. My luggage ended up arriving 4 days later. I was told to keep my receipts for any clothing I had to buy because of luggage delay and I'd be compensated by the airline but their online claim forms crash and do not work. Have tried 3 times but impossible to complete. Overall a very forgettable experience and would advise not to use this airline.

### "were asked to pay for re-booking of flight"
Tel Aviv to Bangkok. We planned a trip to Vietnam and Cambodia in very high detail, about six months before traveling; flights and ground services were booked and were reserved accordingly. On July 3rd, 2016, we left with high expectation, a group of five people, to fly on EL AL flight LY081, planned to depart at 2230. We had a connecting Vietnam Air flight to Hanoi, with a layover of two hours and ten minutes, significantly higher than from conventional MCT. Although we did an early check in early, and left our contact information, EL AL did not update us directly on the two-hour delay in flight. We heard of this delay only on the way to the air field. The magnitude of the delay was reveled when it was too late to book an alternative connecting flight, while we still had the opportunity (free seats wise). We had to wait for hours before the flight left, almost 3 hours after the scheduled time. We arrived to Bangkok after an exhausting flight in El Al's old 747 plane, amazing to see this plane is still in service (seat handles ashtrays openings, still existing). Upon arrival to Bangkok, EL AL representative escorted us, trying to help us find a connecting flight. We were on a "waiting list" for Vietnam Airlines flight, which was scheduled to leave at 1905. If we had gotten on this flight, there would have been a minimal damage to our trip itinerary. We were delighted when we learned that we had seats available on this flight. But, we were asked to pay for re-booking of flight. EL AL were not willing to paying the additional $120 per person for this change. In order to avoid extra costs (cancellation of hotel reservation, change an itinerary, etc. ), we decided to pay the above amount and to clarify the matter with EL AL, in a later stage. Unfortunately, the payment process prolonged and the flight left without waiting for us. When we turned to EL AL station, to arrange the next connecting flight, they declared they cannot help us, and told us to come back on the next day. We had to stay another night in Bangkok and cancel the ground services booked and paid in Hanoi, Vietnam. We found ourselves the first alternative connecting flight, that had seats available (Thai Air), and paid $ 350 per person. It goes without saying that since the trip was carefully planned, on a daily and even hourly basis, we had to make changes and concessions and disrupted our enjoyment.

### "whole rows or sections were missed"
It has been almost 30 years since I flew to Israel and I thought I would always fly El Al. Yes the security is great but it was far below par on many things. Flew from Perth to Tel Aviv via Hong Kong and Bangkok. The main complaint I have is the way satff give out beverages and food. Not just once but several times was this done so haphazardly that whole rows or sections were missed. I had to ask the staff to return to give a section food, at which point I was told we were all sleeping, we were not. Towels were given out to sections and missed with others. Bottles of water were given out and then not to others. It was like they started well then just forgot where they had got up to. Just not good enough.

### "a blatant untruth"
I had not flown El Al for years and had almost forgotten why I avoid this airline. We booked a flight with Iberia from Tel Aviv to NYC with a stopover in Madrid. The first leg was with an El Al flight to Madrid. Take off was delayed due to an unfortunate illness of one of the passengers, the plane was freezing and when I requested a blanket I was told that there were none. We landed in Madrid one hour late and were assured by the pilot on the p.a. system that a representative of the connecting flight would accompany us to the gate for our flight. In fact El Al had already e-mailed the passenger service to send us to a hotel until the following day. I could easily cope with this delay but had great difficulty with a blatant untruth. I will make every effort not to fly El Al in the future.

### "inflight entertainment was shocking"
We recently flew to Israel on El Al from Hong Kong. We had a short layover but this is very common and we were also delayed 1.5 hours. Surely 3 hours is enough time to get our bags on board? No, bags were lost and were only sent to us two days later. The inflight entertainment was shocking, the movies were on a loop so you had to keep checking, tray tables falling apart and the aircraft was so old. The second flight we had booked was from Israel to Bangkok and then we a flight from Bangkok to Hanoi. El Al sent no message to us to say it was delayed and we had checked in. Not even an email. It was delayed 2 hours due to a flight coming late from the previous destination. El Al showed no remorse that we were going to miss our flight to Vietnam, even so they wouldn't even write us a letter for insurance. I emailed the customer service email as I was instructed to and was told "we will do our get back to you in 21 days". Clearly not a priority. We got to Bangkok and sat with Vietnam airlines for 4 hours on stand by and they finally said there was 2 seats but we needed to pay. They are a disgrace, we spent 24 hours running around airports because of their disorganisation and lack of care. Will not fly them again.

### "very good experience"
Tel Aviv to Toronto with El Al. Flight on time, plane clean with very comfortable seats. Inflight entertainment via I Pad is not as good as competitor's offerings. Crew exceptional friendlyand caring - without being overbearing. Flight leaves just after midnight and arrives before 7AM in Toronto, allowing for a full night sleep. All in all a very good experience.

### "staff very attentive and friendly"
A very nice experience overall flying from Tel Aviv to Vienna. Flight was on time, security process and boarding very smooth. Cabin staff very attentive and friendly. Seat comfort okay, leg room was average like on any other mid-range flight. No personal IFE but a movie was screened in the overhead monitors. Aperitif with a snack and a hot meal (two choices, very delicious for airplane food) were served. I chose them because the ticket was more than 100 Euros cheaper than Austrian Airlines for the same route, next time I will chose them for the quality I have experienced.

### El Al Israel Airlines customer review
New York JFK to Tel Aviv with El Al - I recommend flying with another airline if you plan flying in economy class. The seats on El Al have no legroom and the recline is sometimes broken (when I asked for help with my seat they said they can't do anything). The kosher food is not bad and they are usually on time, however the staff are not always friendly.

### "bunch of reluctant staff"
Tel Aviv to Mumbai. Israel is an amazing country with some of the most beautiful places in the world. Unfortunately El Al Israel Airlines is nowhere close. While the flight is normally ontime, you are welcomed by a bunch of reluctant staff who are not only rude but adamant of their politeness. They are unwilling to help. The planes are old, staff at the check in counter are not interested in helping passengers and only want to fleece guests for excess baggage. The food on the flight was inedible on my flights in and out of Israel. They are lucky to have business from almost 90% of their guests only because they fly direct.

### "experiences so horrendous"
My last few experiences with El Al have been so horrendous. On two separate occasions (our flight from NY to Israel, and now our flight from Israel to Bangkok), El Al have "mysteriously" cancelled our reservation and told us that we were on Standby. The first time for no reason. And the second time when I tried to use my credit card they said that because it was a foreign credit card (American Express) they needed further authorization, i.e. passport pictures, credit card images, a form, etc. We sent all of that in. And then got confirmation that we were all set. Even got a confirmation email. Now, a day before our flight they're telling us that they don't have any reservation for us and that if we want to book a flight the same flight, it's going to cost us an extra $800. Are you kidding me?? I'm sorry - for all the things Israel is good at, it's an embarrassment to have an airline that operates like this.

### "flight from hell"
Tel Aviv to Newark with El Al, and to put it mildly, this was the flight from hell! The worst part was we could not get into a restroom because a certain passengers needed to perform a religious ritual on the plane and were allowed to congregate in the aisle and block other passengers from using the bathroom. When we could eventually access the restroom. There was no toilet paper, soap or paper towels. Flight attendants did not came through the cabin once to offer anything (including water) for many hours. They have antiquated entertainment and no wifi. We did not hear anything from the pilot - no acknowledgement or words of welcome, or assurance when going through some fairly severe turbulence.

### "thanks to this young man"
After an uneventful El Al flight from Zurich to Tel Aviv on 13th January, a young member of the crew seeing my great difficulty to walk (I am 86), ordered the buggy for me! As I was sitting waiting, he even came to check whether I had been fetched, and called again. Again, all my thanks to this young man.

### "experience was very good"
Tel Aviv to Luton with El Al. Excellent flight, lots of leg room in business and comfortable seat for 5 hour flight. Aircraft was clean and tidy and departed on time. Breakfast was served on this flight which was OK, service was reasonable although the drinks service was pretty sparse. Inflight entertainment was via overhead screens which is pretty dated by today's standards on a full fare airline. In view of this used my iPad although I think El Al has some form of iPad app for entertainment but didn't use it. Arrived in Luton virtually on time, bags collected in quick time too, overall the experience with El Al was very good and the business class seats and space are far superior to BA for example. I would definately fly El Al again even in economy , as we did on the way out from the UK.

### "they left my bags behind"
London to Tel Aviv return on El Al.After 3 hours of security checks at the airport I had almost 6 hours of screaming kids all around me. The airlines count was 35 kids all in the same section. Jumping, running, screaming. On top of that El Al had the kindness of informing me mid flight that they left my bags behind. No explanation, the bags are not lost they were left behind! Amazing airline, the entertainment system is from the 80's where we all can watch the same movie on the overhead, and the service is overwhelmed with requests from people asking for parents to control their kids! This happened to me on both flights - there and on the way back to London.

### "thankfully slept"
New York (JFK) to Tel Aviv on El AL. I thankfully slept for 7 of the 12 hour flight. This was fortunate as someone in the row behind us kept swatting my seat mate on the head and thumping on the back of her seat. This in turn resulted in multiple visits by the flight crew to intercede. Food wasn't bad. Seat the usual cramped economy. Entertainment limited.

### "only passenger in First class"
Tel Aviv to New York JFK with El Al in first class. King David Club at TLV was very nice with large selection of pastries and breakfast items. I was the only passenger in First class and was treated like royalty by the crew. The seats are 2-2-2 without aisle access for the window seat if full there is room to exit from the window seat stepping over the passenger next to you. The seat otherwise was comfortable. The highlight was the amazing array of Israeli/Meditteranean food served for breakfast and lunch/dinner, served with attentive and friendly service. It was the best food I have eaten on First/Business of any airline. Only limitation was the somewhat outdated IFE though on this plane it was at least VOD.

### "bad experience with El Al"
Very bad experience with El Al - the service is really slow and unfriendly - I was flying to visit my boyfriend. Apparently giving them his name wasn't enough to let me go. I was being told to show his facebook, our talks and all details about our relationship. Eventually they decided to call him by the phone and wake him up (it was 6 in the morning!). After the call they let me go. All these took them around half an hour of being confused and stressed what the hell they want from me. I travel to Israel often with LOT and Wizzair and none of these airlines acted so annoying. I can only explain it by curiosity of the El Al clerks what it is like to be in an international distant relationship or whatever.

### "attendants will ignore you"
Terrible experience. We flew El AL fro0m Tel Aviv to Bangkok for our honeymoon. We chose El Al Israel Airlines because it was the only direct flight to Thailand. It was more expensive than other airlines, but we thought the high price was worth a direct flight. Seats with not much space for feet and knees. Seems lower than other airlines. Also, the back of the seat was twisted in a weird angle. Not comfortable at all for a 10.5 hours flight. We saw my seat was not the only one which was not maintained well. Entertainment was bad. Very bad. One would expect to have a normal entertainment system, but what we had is a 10-15 old year entertainment personal system. Tiny LCD's (4 or 5 inch) very low resolution, dead pixels and not touch sensitive. Variety of media was also poor. Very disappointing for such a long flight. Food was fair. Not more than that. Service - many time the attendants will ignore you (they seem not to hear you talking to them). Value for money: very low. Not recommended.

### "no screens for the 12 hour journey"
My trip with El Al Israel Airlines was marred by the fact that there are no screens for the 12 hour journey from Israel. Luckily, the seats were so comfortable that I was able to get about 10 hours of sleep and wake up just in time for breakfast. The crepes in the morning are great and the crew were nice in both Hebrew and English. The seat was very comfortable and the mood lighting gave the illusion that the plane was new. The truth is though, that El Al has outdated planes, El Al relied on people's mobile devices for entertainment and the problem there is that, customers did not know that an appointment existed for in-flight entertainment, and this problem is exclusive for the Tel Aviv-Toronto route. Also, it seems that ashtrays were more important than a remote even if smoking on planes is banned. I give El Al 5/10 because of their terrible plane quality but decent service to makeup for it.

### "great food and outstanding crew"
Very polite and efficient security check in Vienna. As they have just 3 counters and the VIE station is small, the check in itself was fast and easy. Boarding process at the gate started 1 hour before the flight. Flight left 15 minutes late but arrived in Ben Gurion on time. Cabin crew was charming, cabin was clean and food was great. Much legroom between the rows. Very comfortable seats. Good choice of beverages and even wine selection. Ben Gurion airport check in was fast. Flight from Ben Gurion to Vienna left on time and arrived early in Vienna. Again a very pleasant flight with good music, great food and outstanding crew.

### "total waste of money"
New York to Tel Aviv return on El Al for my first trip to Israel. Coming back, I paid additional $150 for premium economy seat. Total waste of money. Compared to my window economy seat going over, I could discern no improvement. Cramped seating, poor leg room (kicked portable footrest out of the way as it was so uncomfortable). Broken table and entertainment system. No difference in seating recline. Food rotten. Loved Israel. Would probably not take El Al again. No WiFi. Nowhere to plug in my phone or IPad.

### "cabin crew was indifferent"
Newark to Tel Aviv. The aircraft interior was ragged and very dirty. That's the reason I had switched from El Al to Lufthansa a decade ago. Well, it hasn't improved in all of that time. It's not so convenient going through Frankfurt and Lufthansa is not the most comfortable of all airlines, but I think overall Lufthansa remains a better choice. The El Al cabin crew was indifferent, the food was quite uninspired, the inflight entertainment was mediocre. We were more-or-less on-time, and I didn't have any check-in problems. Still not the airline for me.

### "crew very friendly and polite"
Our family flew economy with El Al to Tel Aviv from Bangkok on September 19th and return trip on October 10th 2015. On both occasions ground and air crew were very friendly and polite. The food onboard was above average. IFE was good going from Bangkok to Tel Aviv but not so great on the return trip but as we were flying all night and trying to sleep it did not matter. The plane was old but clean and the toilets were kept clean during both flights. All of the staff were great and very accommodating. My one and only criticism is that the plane was warm which made flying just a tad uncomfortable. I read in the onflight magazine that all of their 747's are being replaced in 2017. Will fly with them again.

### "El Al destroyed my vacation"
I am an El Al Matmid Frequent Flyer Club member, and flown El Al for over 10 years. I sweat easily. The security person was rude, would not look at my printed out receipts and itinerary, hotels, car rental, etc. She actually shoved the paperwork out of the way and mocked my sweating and made fun of it in front of other passengers. They destroyed my vacation, I literally lost close to 2 grand in cancelation of accommodations, etc. The staff was unapologetic, their only comment "we can just rebook you for a future flight. My vacation ruined.

### "finally see El Al improve "
I had no choice but to fly El AL because they offer one of only two non stop flights from TLV to BUD. Flying out of TLV ground staff and FA were friendly and smiling. The flight was on time. The plane had much better leg room than I have had on transatlantic planes I have flown. I am six feet tall and I had plenty of room to spare for my knees. The plane was not modern nor was it refurbished, no entertainment just a row of overhead screens with some kind of Israeli TV show that no one was watching. The plane was clean. Service was minimal, but so was the price paid for tickets. Our flight back BUD to TLV was the same, and friendly crew. It was a nice change to finally see El Al improve since last time I flew with them.

### El Al Israel Airlines customer review
When I checked in for the flight, it was not such a bad experience. However, when I boarded  I was greeted with a frown and cabin crew did not greet us in any way. The seats were dirty, uncomfortable and legroom was tight. I was not looking forward to this long haul flight. After take off, we were served meals. The cabin crew  did not have any interaction with me other then asking my choice of meal. I smiled and said a hello expecting one to come back but to no avail. The meal was tasteless and not appetizing. IFE was also not up to expectations.

### El Al Israel Airlines customer review
At Munich airport, El Al has its own terminal with its own security guards surveying the check-in. You must show your ticket to get inside, and once inside, they interrogate you as though they were police. After scanning my carry-on and frisking me, my bag had to be personally inspected by a security guard. I was isolated in a separate room while they did it. They finally let me go after 20 minutes, when I was given my boarding pass to board the plane. They bussed us for about 15 minutes to an isolated stand, and we boarded through a small building that had an escalator up to the plane. Once aboard, the staff were very nice. I thankfully had an aisle seat, which was comfortable with good padding. The food was good, and I liked the video selections. I would consider flying El Al again.

### El Al Israel Airlines customer review
Tel Aviv to Amsterdam - I liked everything. The seats are comfortable, the food was tasty and the staff were always available for requests. Entertainment also offered a good selection. I would recommend El Al.

### El Al Israel Airlines customer review
Flight was half-full. I had the whole row to myself. The flight took of on time and one hour later the service started. I could choose 2 drinks. The meals service had two choices: 1) meat ball with couscous, salad and chocolate cake. 2) tuna salad, some fruits and a honey cake. After the meal service the lights inside the cabin were turned off. Every hour one of the cabin crew members came around with water. During the whole flight there was juice available in the rear galley. Two hours before landing the cabin crew gave us a second meal. Omelette, bun, butter, salad and lemon cake (that was very good). We landed on time.

### El Al Israel Airlines customer review
Very uncomfortable journey. Seats not good. Common inflight entertainment. Had ordered for Asian Vegetarian food but got a salad.

### El Al Israel Airlines customer review
Mediocre and lackluster service. Impersonal staff, but not impolite. My friend had indicated vegan on both routes. (JFK to TLV and vice versa) and they had not even registered the option. Inflight entertainment is almost non existent. They play the movies for you and you don't control anything. Seat back screen size resembles a nintendo screen. Flying out of JFK, we were subjected to major harassment in the name of security. Our carry on's were kept at the gate and given to us and personally escorted to the plane. Obviously this is after going through and checking the entire contents of the bag. This is my 3rd time flying to Israel, but first on El Al. Never encountered anything remotely like this before.

### El Al Israel Airlines customer review
Nothing was horrible, just mediocre. The cabin, seats, entertainment system, all seemed to be very old and updated. The carpet was worn and dirty, the seats uncomfortable and not able to lay flat. But beyond the second rate cabin facilities was the very second rate service. Nobody was impolite, it was more like they just weren't focused on the passengers. Every flight I took on this vacation (there were 4 legs) was significantly late taking off but the passengers were either left in the dark about the cause of the delay or we were given some implausible explanation (ATC issues that involved no weather or unusual traffic). I suspect that the real issue is that El Al is so focused on security, and spends so much money on it, that they just don't have resources left to deal with the finer points of running a decent airline.

### El Al Israel Airlines customer review
TLV-OTP-TLV. Outbound Boeing 737-900ER, brand new aircraft with sky interior and slim new seats. Very good entertainment, overhead LCD with TV shows. Food very good some chicken tapas, tahini hummus, pita salad and chocolate mousse. Crew young, smiling and friendly. Got delayed for 2 hours because of some closed routes but kept informing us so no problem. Boarding done quickly and right after takeoff so no waiting on aircraft. Inbound Boeing 737-800. Left before time and upgraded to preferred seat for $50, great seat near window emergency exit with a lot of space, also middle seat empty so felt like European business on other airlines. Again overhead entertainment on LCD screen. Didn't eat but choice was tapas - either tuna or chicken. Given 2 cans of cola and fanta. Crew friendly and young purser was very funny. Captains update on route weather and procedures very nice. Will fly again, definitely improved and with new aircraft cheaper and better than competitors.

### El Al Israel Airlines customer review
Such relief to get on an EL AL flight after other planes. Swiss and El Al are up there then Lufthansa then the rest. You feel like you're finally taken care of. Good well maintained planes responsible professional flight attendants normal seats (better on Swiss but the El Al entertainment was much better). Very good food the attendant offered a second "leftover" plateau when my colleague said he was still hungry. They get the job done professionally and with care. All in all great experience.

May 12th LY32. May 21 LY31. We were very disappointed with our flights to and from Tel Aviv. The seats are the most uncomfortable seats that you can possibly sit in. The seats need to be re-stufffed. They have been this way for a very long time and we do not plan to fly El Al until we are assured that the problem is fixed. As well there were problems with the electrical system as when we tried to read the lights kept going off.

Hong Kong - Tel Aviv on a rather tired B777-200 aircraft. Flight delayed at Hong Kong for an hour as part of an effort to solve the inoperative In-Flight Entertainment System of the aircraft. The IFE remained unusable during the entire 13 hour flight for all passengers. The online seat reservation system indicated a reserved window seat but on arrival at the airport I discovered that no reservation had been made and I was given the dreaded middle seat. The seat was uncomfortable and the adjustable headrest could not maintain its position. The wine revolution that has swept Israel during the last 15 years has obviously deftly bypassed El Al. The red wine can best be described as simple plonk better used for cooking. The meals were a little industrial but average on a world standard. The crew were friendly and tried hard. The purser's announcements were in broken English and thus barely coherent including the safety demo which was performed manually due to inop IFE. This safety demo was without the life jacket explanation leaving the embarrassed giggling cabin staff standing with life jackets in hand. With an aged widebody fleet El Al happily charge a premium price and provide a mediocre flight experience. These particular thirteen hours left a very poor impression indeed.

Flew July 2014 from TLV to FRA with the B737-900ER 4X-EHE at this time it was a month old the crew were very friendly the food was delicious. It was a morning flight so we got breakfast omelette salad onions pitta bread with hummus tea or coffee and light drinks. The seats were extremely comfortable the interior looks like the Boeing 787's cabin the Inflight Entertainment was fair on the main screen 3 movies were screened live news and radio channels. Boarding was fast but when we finished boarding a siren was sounded a rocket was launched to Tel Aviv crew were very calm and said we had to evacuate the aircraft but once we had evacuated almost immediately we got back on. Landing was on time. I'm satisfied with everything on EL Al.

ATH-TLV-ATH on a new B787-800 cabin clean but are between seats narrow. Plane departed Athens with 15 minutes late (on return was on time). Service was nice offered newspapers before boarding the plane. Only a sandwich and a bottle of water was offered. Two television programs was shown on the drop down screens there were 7 music channels with great earphones to hear it. Overall good service but nothing outstanding. Security check was speedy with a lot of station serving the passengers.

I fly frequently from MXP to TLV. Check-in procedure is always annoying both in MXP and in TLV being asked dozens of questions of the reason why I keep flying to Israel is ridiculous and does not feel me any safer. They inspect your luggage and open all bottles (e.g. shampoo creams) so you end up having a mess in your suitcase when you land. Seats are ok crew is never friendly food is great best ever on an airline. There is individual entertainment and the movies they show during the flight are fairly old.

I flew from Tel Aviv to New York and a week later I made the return trip. On both flights the seat was uncomfortable the aisle was narrow the passenger in front of me moved her seat back for the entire flight. I felt a prisoner for ten hours. I needed to do exercises for my blood circulation but there was nowhere to move. If I stood in the aisle for more than ten seconds there was always someone pushing me one way or the other or the airline staff needed to get past. I stopped to talk to a friend and one of the other passengers who wanted to get past yelled at me to move. It may be more economic for ElAl to narrow the space and push in more passengers and earn more. Why not offer a bonus for anyone who remains strapped in their seat for the entire flight without moving! The entertainment was intolerable and unacceptable and geared to one sector of the population only. For a twelve hour flight there should have been a choice of films or music with a much wider variety. There was no classical music no games no non-fiction film no topics of general interest - nothing on Israel or on a religious topic. From a brief look at the hundreds of passengers on the flight the available entertainment probably interested only a small percentage.

We flew on Flight 29 from TLV to Toronto Feb 28-March 1. We were supposed to connect to a WestJet flight to Winnipeg. Theses arrangements were made by our travel agent via the El Al reservation system. We arrived in Toronto pretty much on time but because we had to wait 1 hour for our baggage (ours came out last) we missed our connection and spent 16 hours in Pearson Airport waiting for the next available flight. When it looked like we were going to miss our connection my wife went looking for the one El Al employee in the baggage claim area. She told my wife that it wasn't her responsibility (wrong-the reservation was made through El Al) and to go talk to WestJet. When our bags finally came out we went looking for her again because we didn't know what to do. After we finally found her again she once again told us to find someone from WestJet (who then told us it really was El Al's responsibility but tried to help us anyway). By the way we paid extra for Economy Plus. The extra legroom makes it worthwhile because it makes it much easier to sleep but they often run out of movie iPads before they get to your row!

### El Al Israel Airlines customer review
I flew with El Al round trip three times. From JFK to TLV thrice. Firstly you get on a cramped aircraft. Then if you are the majority of the passengers flying in economy you get to your "seat" (a rock solid and uncomfortable small bench) and sit down and begin to feel cramped and uncomfortable. The best part is you didn't even start your ten hour torturous flight with El Al! You then begin to deal with the rude cantankerous flight "attendants. These flight "attendants" are there to throw your uniform meal at you and give you dirty looks and make you feel like they're doing you a favor by bringing you your food. The food is surprisingly pretty satisfactory. Maybe the only good thing about this airline is the meal. It's usually a dinner with chicken and rice and a pastry. For breakfast it's usually a piece of bread and a half frozen omelette with yoghurt. Then after your meal you want to try and get some sleep. You begin to think that after about twenty minutes the "attendants" will take your meal tray to the garbage. You might as well try to fall asleep because you will most likely wake up a few hours with the tray still there! The crew is unbelievably rude. While you continue to sit like a sardine in their cramped "seats" you try to fall asleep which is even harder. You then wake up after a few hours (if you're lucky) of uncomfortable sleep and wake up with back and neck pain. You then head over to the kitchen to politely ask for a drink of water and your immediately met with two El Al steward/ess' talking to each other and completely ignore you until you disrupt their conversation to ask for water. I will make it my duty to never fly with this "airline" again.

B767 Toronto-Tel Aviv-Toronto. Very old plane 12.5 hours flight w/o entertainment. Delay of 3.5 hours because of the technical problems. On the way back all the passengers got out w/o luggage. We received it next day. Never again. I'll take another company even with a connection.

### El Al Israel Airlines customer review
I flew from TLV to FCO on the 737-900 the newest plane of El Al. The new economy class seats are very good and the entertainment system was very good. The crew members were very nice. The best thing about El Al is the food.

Flew from Tel Aviv to Warsaw and back in December 2014. Both flights with B.737-800. Flights left on time staff extremely friendly and helpful delicious and hearty meals comfortable seats and nice IFE. Great value for money. I was truly pleased.

### El Al Israel Airlines customer review
Returned to Israel on LY 008 from JFK New York on Nov 8th. The crew who are normally very pleasant were absolutely awful pushing past people without a word of apology they acted as though they were doing us a favor by being there and were very sour faced and frankly quite rude most of the time. As a frequent flyer this is the first time I have encountered such a terrible staff attitude on this or any other EL Al flight.

### El Al Israel Airlines customer review
I was so disappointed with El Al. We flew from Bangkok to Tel Aviv and back again. There was absolutely no leg room and I am an average sized female. The screen on the plane over was tiny and the selection of entertainment was poor and I could hardly hear anything anyway. The food was average and the less said about the flight attendants the better. They are representing their country so you would think that they would care about what visitors think but they were completely indifferent. Once the meal was served that was it you didn't see them unless you went to the back of the plane and asked for a drink and then they didn't even look at you when they poured it. The lack of service etc was even more noticeable because our flight from Australia was with Thai and we were very impressed. The flight back was in a better plane with more leg room and bigger screen but the entertainment choice was still so poor that I didn't bother much and the food was still average. The attendants were also a bit more friendly on the way back. My first trip with El Al and I would say it will probably be my last with them which is a shame.

### El Al Israel Airlines customer review
Tel Aviv to Rome Italy round-trip. Sept 15 LY385. Oct 7 LY386. We had a perfect flying experience. Granted the security is a bit much - but our safety is worth the inconvenience. They have the most professional and seemingly smart security personnel. The check-in and inflight staff were friendly and very helpful. The flight was uneventful - exactly what you one hopes for. Inflight food service was equal in quality to every other first class airline we travel on.

### El Al Israel Airlines customer review
Flew TLV-BKK with a 747. Plane was old and dirty. The service was okay but the food was inedible. The TV's were on a loop with 2 out of the 4 channels not working. Unfortunately this is the only airlines for me to travel to Israel but whenever I get the chance I'm taking another airline.

LY339 Tel-Aviv - Amsterdam 28 Sep 2014 737-800 window seat. The flight was full and had a delay of almost 2 hours which is main reason of the total score however El Al arrival and departure times are more convenient as compared with KLM. The flight attendants were not particularly cheerful but they did their job professionally. There was a choice of 2 main courses I opted for chicken meatballs with couscous which tasted fine. The seats with adjustable headrests were quite comfortable.

### El Al Israel Airlines customer review
ATH-TLV-EWR horrible service. Security never ending. Wanted me to explain reason for my vacation why had so much vacation time. Looked through my phone pics in ATH. Onboard first flight warm sandwich and bottle of water. No entertainment. Prepared for landing very early close to 45 mins out. On way to Newark one beverage service with tiny cups. No beer or spirits. Only soft drinks and red wine. Then dinner which was OK. No further beverages entire flight. Only tiny water on meal tray. They did follow up with coffee. IFE was so old and on a loop. Made 12 hour flight unbearable. I fly often and found these seats horrible. No room to move. Only plus were gate agents who were kind. Crew and security out of control and rude. Never again.

### El Al Israel Airlines customer review
TLV-ATH-TLV in July. Outbound full B747-400. Total chaos during boarding many of the home printed boarding cards did not pass the reader many passengers were asked to wait aside for new boarding cards for up to 20 min. Not a nice scene. Onboard no IFE the excuse "short flight" never heard of such a poor reason. Food was a warm bun with cheese or tuna and a bottle of water. Poor. Some passengers were offered choices between cheese or tuna some were not. Kids were offered nice toys or games nice touch. Return onboard B737-800 all went perfectly. Friendly and organized crew but same poor catering. This time IFE was offered even though flight was "shorter" than outbound. All in all good experience.

### El Al Israel Airlines customer review
TLV-BKK round trip. Flight was old and not comfortable. Service was non-existent on both flights. The tasteless food was given as if we were begging for it. When I asked for water from the crew it was also given in a similar manner. Apart from those interactions the staff was invisible throughout the flight. There was no on-board entertainment. Also we weren't able to hear anything the pilot said due to bad speakers. The toilet was filthy. Definitely not worth going through the excessive security and flying the longer route (to avoid other middle eastern countries) for such old plane and bad service.

Friday June 27th from London Luton. Returned on July 6th. I flew with EL-AL June 2014 London-TLV-London. 737-800 series from Luton. I find staff very friendly and always willing to help. Very acceptable food. Best thing about EL-AL is the security.

B777 LHR-TLV. Warm welcoming crew at the door inclusive of head stewardess nice touch. Had a bulkhead seat which was comfortable. Free soft and alcoholic drinks followed by a delicious hot lunch Israeli Style. 2 water rounds on a 4 hour flight toilets clean cabin crew always smiled and ready to serve. IFE on demand but very limited selection. Great Israeli hospitality US carriers can learn one or two things about economy class service from ELAL.

### El Al Israel Airlines customer review
Flew from HKG to TLV last week on Boeing 777. Unlike my previous flight in the opposite direction this flight was very good. The purser and flight attendants were friendly and helpful. The food was tasty.T here were drink runs throughout the flight. The seats were comfortable for economy class. The toilets were kept clean. The entertainment system was on demand but programing was limited. It goes to show that the quality of the flight is determined by the crew and this is inconsistent on El Al.

### El Al Israel Airlines customer review
Flew from LAX to Tel Aviv and back on 777. Crew was curt and inattentive service is not a word staff understand please and thank you was like wise. The food was eatable but uninspiring plane was dirty.

### El Al Israel Airlines customer review
TLV-LAX B777. Seat back when not reclined is too stiff and strains neck muscles. Just two meal services both very light. Very poor snack selections. IFE is laughable fuzzy video on fixed loop with obscure movies. That El Al cannot invest in state of the art IFE for such long flights is shameful. Flight attendants pretty curt and careless (delivered my special meal to the wrong seat and didn't check or apologize). While the 3-3-3 seat layout on the 777 helps the cabin still seemed very cramped.

### El Al Israel Airlines customer review
TLV-HKG Boeing 777. At check-in staff were so rude in their manner and speech to the passenger. Sold me an extra leg room seat that had no electric's no reading light working no movie screen working. When complained to the purser he shouted that it was not his problem. A fellow passenger an El All platinum ff member told me that the seats have not been working for a while. All the extra leg room seats electric's were not working. It is unfair to charge unsuspecting customers for seats that they know do not work. It is terrible being on a 12 hour flight without being able to read or watch anything. The food portions were tiny but tasty. The hostesses did not hand out landing cards for Hong Kong when I asked them they said it was not needed! Wasted 10 minutes having to fill them up at immigration. No drink service throughout the flight had to go get water which were given in tiny cups. Not a pleasant experience.

We flew Bangkok to Tel Aviv on 13/01/2014 and return to Bangkok 27/01/2014. Both planes were old Boeing 747s extremely cramped seating and not very clean. Food served was very average staff needed a lesson in politeness. On return trip we were asked if we wanted to upgrade our seats which we did as I had had both hips replaced. We accepted this and paid $99 each to be given two seats under the TV screen at the partition of the section I could not stretch out both of my legs as it was impossible. I asked the hostess to move the both of us as these seats had less leg room than we had previously been allocated. I explained to the hostess that we had paid for extra leg room and that it was impossible to sit in these seats for 10.5 hours. We were moved to the area at the kitchen which was more leg room. but the noise and traffic in the aisle was pathetic. To charge $99 each was nothing short of a RIP OFF. I suggest that It is about time that EL AL bought some new planes and retire these old planes to the Arizona graveyard. Never again.

### El Al Israel Airlines customer review
I was traveling with my wife and my 6 year old and 3 year old. The seats I was assigned were split 2 seats together and another 2 seats together mid-way in to the plane. I was under the assumption that when I get to the airport I could ask them to place us near each other as it would be very inconvenient and uncomfortable to be separated from family members on a long flight like this. At the airport the representative said she would see what she could do. There were available seats closer together and closer to the front of the plane. The last thing I expected was that the tickets that were given to me would be taken away minutes after. For no apparent reason the representative revoked the seats. As she handed me the tickets she simply said that she could not give us those seats anymore and the only seats now available were the ones in all the way in the back of the plane. She assured me we were still all going to be seated together and now that's all that could be done. The reps showed no remorse. After boarding the plane I realized that they put my 2 kids with my wife and had me seated in the middle section of the plane. I had to ask someone to switch seats with me so I could be near my family. The seats were unacceptably tiny for a 10 hour flight I am an average sized man and I couldn't move my legs! The smell from the bathroom was absolutely unbearable! I stood up for most of the flight. Although I do understand that certain things are surely out of an airlines control but I do not comprehend why I was treated so poorly during check in.

### El Al Israel Airlines customer review
We flew from Tel Aviv to Bangkok in March 2014. Airplane was a 747-400 in both directions but they hadn't the same configuration. On the flight to Bangkok on the lower deck there was business class in the front of the plane. On the flight back only economy on the lower deck. We decided to book Economy Plus for 150$ each way. On the flight to Bangkok we discovered that our seat were next to the kitchen. Needless to say that there was a lot of interference and I hadn't the opportunity to sleep much despite the fact that it was a night flight. The seats were as promised of an improved model with a higher pitch and a greater recline angle. On the flight back to Tel Aviv the Economy Plus section was situated at the front of the plane were generally you can find the Business Class. This time there was no kitchen nearby but the seats were of an older model with an increased pitch. El Al didn't deliver the same product on the two flights despite what is published on their site. The staff were efficient and kind as always.

### El Al Israel Airlines customer review
HKG-TLV-HKG flew many times over the last decade every time the level of service the quality of food and beverages and the condition of the cabin seems to get worse. Entertainment system always has faults seats are poorly maintained beverages selection is minimal and service between meals is hardly available if you have a window seat you can't find any steward walking the cabin and you must call one specially to bring you a glass of water. An email sent to customer service was never answered and even a survey initiated by El-Al which I had filled was left un-answered. I am a frequent flyer who will try to avoid flying with them in the future whenever possible.

TLV-JFK. Paid extra for more room seats. Seat was next to the kitchen area constant activity. When I asked the flight attendant to please close the curtain I was spoken to in a harsh manner and told I was waking everyone up. I was awake the entire 12 hour flight. What a disaster. I will never fly El Al again. Very rude and inattentive staff.

FRA-TLV Boeing 737-800. EL AL use the Luxx Lounge at FRA. This is shared with Condor TunisAir US Airways Qatar and whoever wants to pay. Packed almost no food available and before passport control. A hassle and not worth it. Crew onboard nowhere near as nice as on the TLV-FRA flight. Not addressed by name this time. While the seat is not a lie-flat seat like LX or BA use to TLV it is more comfortable than the so-called business seat that LH and OS use. There could be more recline and more space between the rows but overall fine. Food and wines were again very good. Overall not as my previous flight with EL AL but better than the product LH offers on this route.

TLV-FRA Boeing 737-800. King David Lounge at TLV a pleasure quiet and with good food and wine. Onboard greeted by a charming purser and his colleague. Always addressed by name. While the seat is not a lie-flat seat like LX or BA use to TLV it is more comfortable than the so-called business seat that LH and OS use. There could be more recline and more space between the rows but overall fine. Food and wines fantastic. Crew were proactive friendly chatty and present at all times. Very good experience!

FRA-TLV round trip. Best Economy Class food I have had. Seated at emergency exit felt like Business Class regarding seat comfort. Entertainment was better than Lufthansa (A321) on this route. Certainly and reasonably more security so needed to be earlier at the airport. Security staff were very nice anyway.

### El Al Israel Airlines customer review
Munich - Tel Aviv. In Munich they have their own building which is very hard to find. Everywhere policemen and interrogators ask you very personal questions. Baggage is searched without exception. I had a full body inspection with special interrogation because I often fly to Dubai and hold a residence Visa there. They try to be friendly but you feel that they don't want you. Seats are ok and food as well but no one speaks English with you. You can see that they actually understand you very well but don't want to answer to you. No smiles the entire flight. Inflight entertainment is not up to date. Movies are played in a look and I actually did not know one single title. All unknown stuff. Not very tempting on a 4hr flight. Never again.

### El Al Israel Airlines customer review
My experience was similar to many of the comments already written. I flew JFK-TLV-JFK. 747 outbound. 777 inbound. It is not the fault of El Al but the 747's faster speed combined with a strong winter tailwind made the JFK-TLV leg 9 hr 45 min. On the return (TLV-JFK) a strong headwind and the 777's slower speed made the trip 12 hr. 5 min. I am 6' 1" (182 cm) so I am glad that I was in business class. I found the quality of service to be mediocre to non-existent. In spite of the long length of the flight and my being in business class I was impressed both by the poor quality of food and the lack thereof! After a 9.40am takeoff a breakfast was served. The main course was a tiny tasteless omelette. The next meal was 10 hours later (lunch). My seat malfunctioned. And as many others comment in the 10-hour interval between meals the cabin staff made themselves disappear. I would also repeat the comment that the planes are old and the toilets dirty. The real question here is: Does anyone care?

### El Al Israel Airlines customer review
I'm sure they're fine but they hardly every smile nor do they even try to speak in English. The food alright I guess but nothing compared to proper Israeli food. The entertainment is ridiculous. In a land known for ground breaking technology they have terrible choices of tv/music/movies that most English speaking people have never heard of. Movie starts once and that's it. I'm 5 foot 10 and I was squashed in the seats beyond belief for the entire time. I travelled on this airline as this is what was chosen by my travel agent - never again. I flew Air NZ from New Zealand to Hong Kong and then at the El-Al airline check we were interrogated and asked some incredibly personal questions. We then flew from Hong Kong to Israel - 33 hours in total - very disappointed indeed.

### El Al Israel Airlines customer review
Cabin was dirty entertainment was a continuous loop so if you missed the start of a film you would have to continue watching because if you changed channel and watched another film you would have to watch it from the same point so you would miss the beginning. Service was poor - never came back when I requested another glass of wine and looked like they didn't want too help. They only smile if you speak Hebrew! Seats were cramped. Food was actually ok but not special - a bowl of hummus and pitta but no beer! Additional security hassles - again if you don't speak Hebrew they will give you an additional grilling in a pointless and child like way possibly searching you as well. A pointless episode as all other flights fly in to Israel without this hassle!

### El Al Israel Airlines customer review
Flew Bangkok - Tel Aviv LY082 and return LY081 September/October 2013. Extensive security interrogations bordering on the ridiculous. Once on board the plane was quite dated and dirty. Entertainment system was too poor to bother with. Food was reasonably good (esp. the breakfast). Onboard service was minimal and cursory (not so much unfriendly just not particularly hospitable - compared to the Thai flight BNE to BKK it was the diametric opposite). Drinks (of all kinds) were not being served regularly but only once with dinner and there was no real selection. Overall it was reminiscent of Finnair on its Helsinki-Hong Kong flights but with an older aircraft. I would suggest avoiding this airline unless you have no other choice.

### El Al Israel Airlines customer review
YYZ-TLV-YYZ LY 030 on 8th of October LY 029 on 15th of October. Both in and outbound flights on time. Very friendly staff excellent leg room and decent sleep comfort. Plane very clean does not show its age. Entertainment has been significantly improved as now an IPad with a large movie selection is being offered. What makes these flights much better then the competition is their scheduling. Both flights are overnight and both arrive in the early morning hours in Tel Aviv and Toronto. This allows to maximize time - staff does its utmost to allow for a long "night time sleep" and jet lag is minimized. An added bonus is their very competitive pricing in Business Class.

### El Al Israel Airlines customer review
Zurich - TLV - Zurich on 737-800. Seat 23A. Seating was more comfortable and spacious than you would expect on a single-aisle aircraft. Cabin and toilets were very clean. Food was tasty generous servings and very friendly and responsive flight attendants on both flights. Alcoholic beverages offered with the meal services and frequent cabin walk-throughs with water and soft drinks throughout this 4 hour flight. Punctual departures both in Zurich and TLV. The comfort in seating and meal service was like on a long-haul aircraft. However EL AL lags behind in the entertainment business as there were only small foldout screens on the sealing. Overall I would recommend this airline to any traveler from Europe to Israel. Very friendly and uncomplicated service including the security personnel - they were very thorough yet very polite.

### El Al Israel Airlines customer review
Flew LTN to TLV and return back to Heathrow both in business class. Flight delayed by 2 hours on the way out and was called and emailed by El Al. The lounge at Luton is nothing special food supplied by a local kosher milky restaurant. 767 was ok it's old and dated but the leg room is great. Seat in front reclines back which does encroach on your space and they give you an iPad as a tv. I travelled with a toddler and the kids meal was okay. Return back on a very fully 747 and really enjoyed the flight. Excellent cabin crew who were lovely and had no issues.

### El Al Israel Airlines customer review
Flight delayed more than 3 hours so I missed an important meeting. Earlier notice would have given me time to find an alternative. The staff didn't even try to help and find a solutions.

Tel Aviv-Munich-Tel Aviv and Tel Aviv-Milan-Tel Aviv. Captain was very nice and welcoming like all flight attendants. The meal was ok. Flew with old Boeing 767-300ER and Boeing 737-800ER.

### El Al Israel Airlines customer review
JFK-TLV TLV-JFK 747-400 rows 25 and 26 seats a/b/c. The cabin definitely showed its age but appeared clean. Lavatories were also clean and remained so for the duration of our long flight. Service on board was not overly warm or friendly but certainly adequate and responsive. On the outbound quite a few seats open in Economy Plus section a couple of rows in front of us and the flight attendant offered to let my husband sit there so my son could lie down across 2 rows and sleep. Food was adequate for economy class (but no alcoholic beverages offered except for red wine). On the outbound my seat cushion in 26A was loose and there was a big gap in the back exposing crayons and a number of other little goodies left over from previous flights. On the return we sat in row 25 just behind Economy Plus. When the people in front of us reclined they may as well have been sitting in our laps! Good for them regarding the recline horrible for us. Speaking of recline my seat and my son's seat would not stay reclined and I kept having to adjust them. Entertainment system completely antiquated and limited! Thankfully I had a good book to read and it was a night flight! Overall I would probably not fly El Al again until they update their equipment into the 21st century.

### El Al Israel Airlines customer review
Flew to Tel Aviv from JFK. Purchased Economy Plus Seat for $149 (One Way). Had more leg room but seat was very uncomfortable. I'm not obese but large enough that I felt like I needed a shoe horn to get into and out of the seat. Foot rests were useless. Was in Row 1 - no overhead storage. Fiasco getting my luggage at arrival. Crew speak very softly on microphone. Aisles are so narrow because airline is packing as many passengers onto aircraft as they can. I heard complaints about legroom in Business Class. Not worth extra investment I'm told. Eleven hours is a long time to be cooped up in such a tiny seat. Return flight was better but passenger comfort is not a priority for El Al. Security was fine. Most of the staff were very pleasant and fine. I would try another airline next time.

### El Al Israel Airlines customer review
JFK to TLV and back to JFK in June 2013. My second time flying them. El Al's product has improved but it is still a far cry from Cathay Pacific Singapore Airlines and other top-flight international airlines. While staff were very good everything else was mediocre. I don't sleep well on airplanes but the economy class legroom on the 747-400 was inadequate and made a very long flight rather uncomfortable even in an aisle seat. Food was OK but I don't understand serving breakfast for a second meal on a daytime flight when it is already 2 pm at the destination. Because the second meal was breakfast there was no soda served so my choices were water tea and coffee. While it was nice to have PTVs in economy the screens were very small and the viewing options limited. I recommend going with another airline even a U.S. one.

### El Al Israel Airlines customer review
Flown EL AL many times but this trip had seemed to be the best. I flew from Luton to Tel Aviv after they dropped prices and increased frequency. Ground staff at EL AL we're very helpful along with security attitude improved quick and easy boarding and a nice welcome onboard by the crew. EL Al had recently been buying many 767-300's which are soon to be replaced by the 737-900 but for the time that they're owning them they are upgrading them which was obvious to me with mood lighting and the installation with Economy Plus. The food was very good I couldn't complain but the absence of PTV is annoying.

TLV-ETH. Got a flight almost as cheap as the bus but considerably faster. Security control (as non-Israeli) at El Als special terminal was terrible almost missed my flight. Staff otherwise very friendly little cookie and a glass of water were served.

Munich - Tel Aviv flight. Delayed take off bad inflight entertainment (small screens 3 rows away) average food filthy toilets.

### El Al Israel Airlines customer review
We traveled from Bangkok to Tel Aviv and then a return flight 4 weeks later. Security was very thorough which we were happy with as it ensured a safe flight. Staff were efficient and friendly and the food was very good. I would definitely fly El Al again and recommend it to anyone flying to the region.

EWR-TLV LY028 TLV-JFK LY011 May 2013 Outbound B777 Inbound B747. Checked in 3 hrs early on a Sunday at EWR before 13.30pm flight. Polite pre-flight screening and check-in agents. EWR can be pleasant and uncrowded on a Sunday morning. After priority seating its general boarding for all not by rows. Not chaotic but something to improve. Newish B777 seat pitch good for my small frame. IFE not bad for 10-11 hrs. Flight time. B747 seat pitch roomy enough for me but cabin and IFE looking tired but clean. Food passable edible with regular drink runs. My low sodium meals were served ahead. Inbound they had sandwiches and drinks at galley. ELAL flight crew a gem. Rest rooms were clean. It's passengers who were messing them up. I wish people would not grab seats in front when standing. Annoying. Pilots were updating on PA regularly. I was able to take short naps on both legs which were quite pleasant. I would fly ELAL again should I visit Israel again.

TLV-BKK Economy Plus. Flight on a very old B767-300 4X-EAR. Good leg room in economy plus. Got an amenity kit. However no entertainment only a big screen. Slept much of the flight. One hour after takeoff served food but didn't eat. After that crew disappeared. They came back only in the end to serve breakfast which was a good omelette and a cake. Nice overall. Would not fly with them on this route unless they change the plane.

We had a horrible experience flying with a baby from Toronto to Israel. We booked a seat with a bassinet and when we arrived we were told that our 11 month old is too old for a bassinet and the seats were reserved for younger babies. On board we discovered that an older (16 month old) baby received a bassinet. To make matters worse our originally assigned seats were occupied by travellers with no children. On this long haul flight there was almost no on-board entertainment. The service was poor and meals were extremely small leaving us and other passengers hungry.

Yesterday I flew from NYC to Israel. In the section I was sitting in there was something wrong with the speakers. Every 2-3 minutes for about a minute at a time the speakers would make a horrible screeching and buzzing sound for the duration of the flight - for 10 hours. The flight attendant tried to fix it eventually offered ear plugs. I have never seen so much chaos or got so little sleep. Due to the chaos they took longer than usual serving the meals and served the kosher special meals long before other meals. I will never fly El Al again!

### El Al Israel Airlines customer review
We traveled from TLV-JNB on EL AL and then on to CPT in December 2012. I have been travelling EL AL all my life and this trip showed how the quality of their product has deteriorated. We flew on an old 762 which only benefit was the good legroom. The food (special kosher) was atrocious there was only a limited (non alcoholic) bar selection and the entertainment was virtually non existent. Fortunately it was a night flight and the reasonably spacious aircraft allowed us to sleep. The staff however were very friendly and helpful and I felt they were trying to make up for the inadequacy of the rest of the product. On the way back SAA caused us to miss the EL AL flight back to TLV from JNB and very kindly sent us via London where we stayed with family for a weekend before returning to TLV on BA in one of their newly refurbished A321 mid-hauls.

### El Al Israel Airlines customer review
Service or the lack of it no surprise at EL AL. If you want to fly from Asia/Australasia to Israel EL AL is probably the only airline to fly. Which is why the flights from BKK are packed 744 featuring bad food non- existent service filthy toilets and dated interiors.

### El Al Israel Airlines customer review
LON-TLV-LON. Excessive security which wasted all of my pre-flight time and messed up my luggage. Flight out was on time but I didn't get any service (only slept for an hour so maybe happened then) nothing on waking up. On the way back at least had entertainment system but was probably from the 80s on a dated 747-400. Food was rubbish service was non existent (I had to ask multiple times for a landing card). This also tends to be a very expensive airline so will avoid.

### El Al Israel Airlines customer review
TLV-PRG on a very tired looking 737-800 with just one class. Plane was cramped narrow seats with insufficient legroom. The seats were dirty and the plane smelt. No personal screens so movie screened on overhead aisle screens. My headphones didn't work. Surprisingly there seemed to be a huge number of flight attendants. I counted at least 12 going back and forth while pushing trolleys full of duty free items and trash. Toilets weren't cleaned during the flight - plane was dirty from start to finish.

### El Al Israel Airlines customer review
TLV-JFK-TLV. Business Class. Outbound on 777 Inbound on 747-400. El-Al's problem is neither the aircraft nor the service but the competition. Practically all other airlines flying direct on this route or similar ones to the East Cost have switched to seats that recline to a full horizontal flat-bed position. El-Al insisting on an old fashioned 3-compartment configuration with a separate first class must differentiate the first from the business and remains with those seats that leave you slipping toward the floor in your sleep. Also the in- flight entertainment system on the 747 is years behind and offers close to nothing. They'll either have to catch up with the rest of the pack or be left with their ultra-orthodox crowd. It's a pity because the crew on both flights was eager to please and sometimes downright enthusiastic much more pleasant than anything I've encountered on other airlines.

### El Al Israel Airlines customer review
Tel Aviv TLV - Warsaw WAW - Tel Aviv TLV. Both flights with Boeing 737-800. Leg space quite satisfactory seats stiff nice in-flight entertainment lovely meals on both directions and extremely efficient and friendly crew always around and ready to assist. The only problem was punctuality: flight was one hour late in one direction and more than an hour late on the other. Crew explained that happened due to the late arrival of the plane in both directions. All in all a very positive experience.

### El Al Israel Airlines customer review
I took Royal Jordanian from Berlin to Bangkok which was fine. My return was on El-Al. Flight from Bangkok to Tel Aviv was more than 4 hours late and we were kept in the dark and our queries basically ignored. The flight itself was on a very old tired B747 with no IFE's and a cold meal for a very long flight. I also fail to understand why El-Al flight attendants do not clean the toilets. I missed my connection to Berlin and my frustrations were met with shrugs and I was offered one measly food coupon for the next flight in 8 hours no hotel nothing. My flight to Berlin was only slightly better.

### El Al Israel Airlines customer review
JFK to Tel Aviv. Terrible experience to say the least. It's been quite a while since I've taken El-Al and it will definitely be my last. The aircraft was newish but the food that was served us was inedible and cold served by the rudest flight attendants I've encountered in years. The bathrooms were filthy just an hour after take- off and were never cleaned. My IFE wasn't working and I got a cold stare when I asked the FA to fix it. Many passengers ignored the seat belt signs throughout the flight and the flight attendants basically didn't care. Never again.

### El Al Israel Airlines customer review
TLV-FRA and back. From Tel Aviv on Boeing 737-800 and returning from Frankfurt on a Boeing 737-700 aircraft. Cabin staff fine although looked sullen when I asked for some water. Legroom was fine. Overhead screen poor quality but good entertainment with no selection. Food was really good even on the return flight there were special Passover kosher rolls (kosher meals are served on all EL Al flights). Bathrooms kept cleaned entire flights. Boarding both Tel Aviv and Frankfurt was fast. Flights were on April this year I heard they improved since. Overall would travel El Al again.

### El Al Israel Airlines customer review
Trip was TLV-HKG. Aircraft was B772. Cabin staff were friendly efficient and professional. Couldn't ask for more. Leg room was cramped for a 1.83 meter person. Seat comfort was fair or better. IFE would have been considered cutting edge in the late 90's. It included a personal screen giving a disappointingly low resolution picture. Content was below the expected international standard but still far from poor. I enjoyed the meal. Overall I would fly with them again.

TLV to YYZ on 767-300 old plane but everything was working ok. Bathrooms rooms were kept clean at all times. Flight was great. Food was excellent. I fly EL Al at least twice a year and always a pleasure.

BKK-TLV-BKK. Full flight on old 747 in economy class. No alcoholic drinks served in economy class except small cup of wine before meal. Meal portions very small and not tasty at all. Entertainment was good with back seat video screens but on return flight old 767 aircraft with no back seat entertainment only large screen which could hardly see. Toilets dirty and although I complained to hostess not cleaned throughout flight. The fare was quite high and was not value for the price paid.

### El Al Israel Airlines customer review
Economy Plus from Bangkok-Tel Aviv-Bangkok. Old planes but flight out ok however return a disaster. Invisible staff filthy toilets mediocre food and after four requests and eight hours later I was told they have no English papers on the flight. Unless there is an amazing deal on El Al I will not travel with them again.

### El Al Israel Airlines customer review
Flew TLV-LHR 317 on Sep 3 2012. Flight was fairly full but boarding was uneventful. Food was OK although entertainment was very limited. The overhead lights on both our seats didn't work. I asked to be re-seated and there was a vacant seat across the aisle from us however the stewardess said I couldn't sit there. Instead she offered me an alternative seat further to the front of the aircraft just behind a squalling baby.

LHR-TLV B747 Business (Upper Deck). First time with EL AL and was a little concerned given the mixed reviews on this forum. However the flight was terrific. In the upper deck in business with attentive and friendly service. Food was delicious and the Israeli wines of a high standard. Cabin clean and roomy. Only [minor] criticism was the out-dated in flight entertainment - but I am not a big fan of this anyhow and prefer to read. Overall a great experience and will fly them again.

We allowed 3 hours for check in flying out of Tel Aviv on a non-stop to JFK. We began by entering a line for baggage screening where a lovely young man asked us 4 questions. Next we proceeded to the counter to check in our bags and get boarding passes. We were not asked a single question by the check in agent. Within 10 minutes we had cleared security and had boarding passes in hand. We then went to departures where we went through airport security normal metal detector hand luggage through a screening machine. We never encountered any type of interrogation or any rude employees. The entire process took less time and was less invasive than an airport in the states. We flew a 747 in coach row 26 three seats together on left side of plane. The seats reclined a full 8 inches comfortable for a long flight. The in flight entertainment was great. No problems with noise level or people congregating together as mentioned in several reviews the food was hot and very good. I found the airline to be very professional the flight was nice and I would fly them again.

### El Al Israel Airlines customer review
Flew JNB-TLV on 14 July and return on 27 July in a B767. Aircraft relatively old but comfortable. Crew on both legs were friendly and constantly up and down the aisles offering water. Meals both breakfasts and lunches were quite tasty for airline food and the bread was served hot and really tasty. In flight entertainment was on the nearly the entire duration of the 9 hour trips. Overall a very pleasant experience.

### El Al Israel Airlines customer review
PRG-TLV-ETH and back 1-2 times a year + a couple of other flights. Good quality natural meals especially on special orders (they are served first too). Some interesting Israeli gifts sold onboard. Disgraceful security interrogations at check-in (claiming to provide real security but probably more theatrical than secure). Generally not cheap but occasionally offering very good deals.

### El Al Israel Airlines customer review
Round trip TLV-Moscow. Outbound B767-300 ancient without PTV. Generous leg room and that's really the important feature. Young all female crew happy to serve. Poor quality breakfast a tiny omelette with yoghurt roll and a mystery dessert. Frequent water runs by crew. Return on a B737-800.Good leg room again no PTV again. Crew again young and friendly service with a smile. This time dinner was much better than outbound meal. Frequent water runs - every 15 minutes. One can tell cuts in inflight amenities compared to previous flights. All in all good value for money paid.

### El Al Israel Airlines customer review
I used this airline 6 times (4 on Bangkok-Tel Aviv route and twice Tel Aviv-Rome route). Staff were friendly and the food was good entertainment was absolutely fine.

### El Al Israel Airlines customer review
LHR-TLV-LHR. Flew out on B747 which had individual seat back screens with a choice of films playing in a fixed pattern. Return flight on B767 with overhead screens with no choice of inflight entertainment screens old and poorly spaced made viewing entertainment a bit of a challenge. Both aircraft's were clean with inflight magazine and the usual seatback options. No amenity kits just headphones pillow and blanket. Boarding at LHR slow and delayed due to late arrival of incoming aircraft. Security checks very through staff ok. Meal Service was slow as there seemed to be a huge number of "Special" meals that had to be distributed before the main service started. Quite a bit of hand luggage slowed down getting on and off the plane - also no formal boarding process just a first come first served. Outbound flight late inbound flight more or less on time.

### El Al Israel Airlines customer review
EWR-TLV economy B777-200. The cheapest flight on this route. Check-in was fast but boarding was slow and the security officer rude and pointless. Plane left 45 mins late but arrived on time. Seat was comfortable with enough space. Food was delicious especially the breakfast. The entertainment was not as extensive as other Asian carriers. Flight attendants were responsive and present in the cabin during this long flight.

### El Al Israel Airlines customer review
I have flown El Al many times both TLV-JFK and TLV-Europe. In terms of legroom while flights between Israel and the US may be a bit tight I have found on all of my flights to Europe that there is plenty of legroom. The menu has been upgraded in the past few years and the food is excellent. The crew are very attentive to passengers' needs.

### El Al Israel Airlines customer review
Sydney-Bangkok on Thai Bangkok-Tel Aviv on El Al - I saw a great contrast. The worst thing apart from long security checks was the minimal seating space. Back of seat pockets hanging off in-seat screen stopped working within 30 mins passengers congregate in the aisles. No safety info some of the "waitresses" rather haughty. No-one was rude but the whole trip was a cramped overly warm experience that ideally demonstrated why the name "cattle class" was invented.

### El Al Israel Airlines customer review
The seats were very narrow and uncomfortable and leg room was the same on my flight from New York to Tel Aviv on a 777 jet. The food was good for airline food and the service was good.

### El Al Israel Airlines customer review
TLV-YYZ. Flight on time clean plane spacious comfortable seat. Nice food pleasant crew. Seat did not have video screen but portable "vidibox" was offered which was an acceptable alternative. In any case prefer to sleep during night flight then watching movies.

### El Al Israel Airlines customer review
Please note most of the good reviews are for Business Class - this is no accident. The economy seating is extremely poor in comparison to many international carriers I've flown. My knees were touching the seat in front before seat was reclined! On the 16 hour flight between Los Angeles and Tel Aviv El Al kept the cabin lights dim and enforced all window shades shut for 14 hours. I have to concur with previous posters about the lack of decorum: some passengers insisted on fully reclining their seats during meals and landing. Strangely flight attendants seemed fearful of some of these people and would not confront them.

### El Al Israel Airlines customer review
Business Class from London to Tel Aviv. Check-in was located in a new area with security lane directly into the duty free shopping area. Staff were thorough and polite. Aircraft was 90 mins late leaving. I was sitting on the lower deck of the 747 with a 2x3x2 configuration. New seating in 'shells' meant there was no reclining seat annoyance. The angle of seat recline and general comfort was poor and I could not get comfortable. Choice of beef chicken or fish with no menu I opted for the fish which was reasonable. Flight attendants pleasant. Immigration at Tel Aviv easy as I was first off the aircraft and luggage soon followed. In summary everything was fine apart from the uncomfortable seats.

### El Al Israel Airlines customer review
Flew from London. Security staff split my partner and I up and questioned us at length they then called us into a side room just before boarding to search our hand luggage. By the end of a long day's travel I felt stressed and miserable. I understand the need for security but there was no attempt at service. The flight itself was ok and the food nice. But as someone else noted they do not observe inflight safety procedures bags are left in aisles and emergency procedures not demonstrated. The in cabin atmosphere was pretty chaotic. That will be the first and last time I fly El Al.

### El Al Israel Airlines customer review
VIE-TLV-VIE on a Boeing 737-800 seats comfy meal sufficient and almost tasty. We booked El Al because it was more than 200 Euros cheaper than Austrian Airlines. We didn't worry about the security before we got to the airport as Israeli friends have told us that we would be asked some questions about security matters only. In the end we spent about 1 hour at the check-in counter telling some young security guy about our private lives and personal relationship. As non-Israelis we were questioned separately and our "stories" were put together afterwards. Telling so much about your private live to some 20 year old security guy is not worth saving 200 Euros.

### El Al Israel Airlines customer review
Probably one of the worst Economy Class cabins I flew. They pack you in like sardines so you are out of luck whether you are in a window or an Aisle seat. Food is horrid service is not rude but sort of non existent. I enjoyed Israel a lot and found that the airline does not represent the country well. The security part was actually not too bad but the flight was hot cramped and rather unpleasant.

### El Al Israel Airlines customer review
Aside from some of the worst service inflight El Al let my cat loose on the tarmac at Ben Gurion airport. When calling their lost and found call centre I was told by a representative that a lost suitcase has a higher priority than finding a family cat. Their actions display a lack of regard for life period. Unlike people in Israel those of us from the United States love and respect our family pets.

### El Al Israel Airlines customer review
We visited the Middle East in May 2011. Before leaving New Zealand we made bookings with El Al (via the Web) to fly Tel Aviv to Cairo. When we arrived at the airport to check in for the flight El Al staff informed us that the flight had been cancelled. They arranged for us to fly to Cairo via Amman with Royal Jordanian the same day but we are cross that they didn't bother to inform us of the cancellation. The booking was made in September 2010 and they had an email address to reach us at.

BRU-TLV-BRU Economy. I fly this route regularly and on the two very rare occasions I saw this flight cheaper than Brussels Airlines I chose it. Never again! On all 4 legs of the flight I was treated like a criminal by ELAL security the front room staff are rude ask the same questions without listening to the answer they left me in a room for over an hour each time and failed to advise why. I appreciate security is very much needed but it must be professional. Israelis were barely checked! The plane was old service awful noisy and safety terrible as airline regulations not enforced such as bags in emergency exits and people removing bags on landing!

### El Al Israel Airlines customer review
JFK-TLV. Security top notch food pretty good and I found flight attendants attentive but the seats on both the 777 and 747 were horrible - the tightest I've ever had to endure. Unless they reconfigure seating I'll never fly El Al again.

### El Al Israel Airlines customer review
TLV-JFK. Flight was overbooked and denied boarding even though we were on a tour. I understand this is a common occurrence and that Israelis are given preference over residence of other countries. El Al wanted to place us on standby even though there were seats in business and 1st class. EL AL wanted to place us on the 600am flight from TLV to Barcelona with transfer to AA plane to JFK. So instead of arriving 600am we would arrive 300pm with no sleep. Not acceptable. Wanted to purchase 1st class ticket EL Al did not want to sell. Finally convinced El AL to sell me the 1st class tickets. Once I became a paying passenger I guess a group ticket does not count as a paying passenger attitudes change and El AL became friendly. Flight was pleasant lots of space seats folded flat FA attentive. Unless you fly business or 1st class cannot recommend this airline.

### El Al Israel Airlines customer review
LAX to TLV recently and the worst flight I've ever been on. Bad leg room terrible food and an elderly lady next to me trying to take over half my seat I've come to expect nothing more from most flights. What I do care about is the careless way they treated my luggage. All of my luggage except for my violin were messed up (and I mean messed up) when I got them back.

### El Al Israel Airlines customer review
EL AL between London and Tel Aviv 4 times now and each time has been stressful in one way or the other. B767 has really bad legroom and is very cramped with very poor IFE. You don't get a choice you just watch whatever is being shown and Iwas a good 4-5 meters away from the pathetically small screen. Many passengers refuse to conform to any rules ignoring the crew instructions. El Al needs to be more forceful in maintaining a level of decorum. Food is very good service was friendly on flight and the airport. Security is lengthy but the security staff are polite. Since I don't have much choice of carrier for business flights I can be sure that I will be flying with them again but after 8 flights with El Al I'm as prepared as I can be - some good earplugs an eye-mask (they keep the lights on too long overnight) an ultra-small laptop to watch my own movies on the cramped seating area and the all-essential neck-pillow. Try to get the thursday evening flight out of Tel Aviv rather than the Friday morning flight - its a lot less busy albeit no less noisy and irritating.

### El Al Israel Airlines customer review
The restrooms and aisles were blocked for long periods of time as men congregated to pray. The seats were awful - narrow and hard. My wife asked for some orange juice; never got it. The security is great but terrible at the same time. I felt safe but was worried I would miss my connecting flight due to some searches taking 30 minutes each. I will never fly El AL again.

### El Al Israel Airlines customer review
I flew El Al for the first time this past week and will never fly this airline again. I was seated next to the galley and the attendants left the curtain open at all times. I kept closing it so I could get some sleep since it was a 1 am flight but the attendant always opened it again. There was so much noise on this flight that I could not get to sleep at all. The reservation desk of El Al made a mistake with my return flight and it took 2 hrs at the airport for them to fix it. The food was the only good thing about this airline.

### El Al Israel Airlines customer review
New York JFK-Tel Aviv Tel Avi to Newark. On the way to Israel B744 old seats old LCD screens with poor quality image. Food okay flight attendants nice and polite. JFK is a nightmare to connect. EL AL security personnel polite. One complaint is that they kept the lights on to allow them to sell Duty Free items for another hour. TLV-EWR newer B777 but not with IFE on demand. Service for dinner only a sandwich since it was a midnight departure. I got a Gluten Free meal which was nice and actually had a taste. The seats on B777 were nicer. EWR much easier to connect. Check in staff in Tel-Aviv excellent. My father in law was 83 they allowed us to go to a special check in desk where the security personnel came and cleared us instead of standing a long line.

Tel Aviv-London Berlin-Tel Aviv in old B757. Cabin crew very friendly and attentive. However there's a big minus for the old plane in the rear of the cabin the noise is almost unbearable. The security check on the flight to Israel was quite surreal the cross- questioning and other things made me feel like in a James Bond movie; however the security personnel friendly. My bag was opened and searched without me but everything arrived in one piece in Tel Aviv.

Tel Aviv to Frankfurt on B767-300. On the bad side the flight was delayed for approx 2 hours due to a technical problem on the incoming aircraft. However we were given accurate information and breakfast was offered in an airport café. Aircraft was old but in good condition and clean. Seat comfortable and seat pitch fine. Staff friendly and attentive serving water during the flight. Hot meal was fine. Headphones free of charge IFE limited to old overhead monitors showing a recent movie.

### El Al Israel Airlines customer review
MAD-TLV Business Class B737-800. On the positive side attentive crew and excellent lunch service. Entertainment program enjoyable. Seat from the old generation but comfortable. Service and comfort would shine more with an upgraded airplane. On the preventive side some flights form the USA and South America connecting in Madrid with ELAL to TLV do not have enough time for luggage to be transfered and go through ELAL strict security process which includes passengers recognition of each piece. This is due not so much for the extra time for ELAL security but mainly for slow luggage transfer and baggage claim at Barajas airport.

### El Al Israel Airlines customer review
C-class Luton-TLV and return TLV-LHR. Out on a tired 757 with far from state-of-the-art seats and antique IFE cheerful crew decent food. Smooth security screening at Luton. Easy clearance through newish T3 at TLV. Return on a 777 - again fairly weary but with an excellent crew. I know my experience is not in accord with others but I found nothing really to complain about other than a somewhat tired collection of aircraft.

### El Al Israel Airlines customer review
CDG-TVL-FCO. CDG-TLV on B777. Aircraft reasonably new and IFE acceptable though not brilliant. Long boarding delays due to what seemed like poor organisation and passengers not following instructions. Econony class was reasonably comfortable. Food not bad. TLV-FCO on an old B737 IFE limited and quite poor and seats were not as comfortable as the B777. The service was reasonable and security whilst thorough and overbearing was not as bad as I had thought that it would be.

### El Al Israel Airlines customer review
I did not enjoy my flights from JFK-TLV-JFK. The meals were OK lack of legroom was appalling. The IFE was passable but nothing on demand just a few movies on a cycle. El Al is too permissive with the amount of carry-on luggage permitted. But the big problem is the passengers who treat the aircraft like a city park wandering the aisles clustering in conversation groups to the point of ignoring the crew’s instructions. El Al needs to enforce some decorum. Crew did their best to smile but seemed to have given up on any hope of more civility. Nice snacks in the galley throughout the flight.

### El Al Israel Airlines customer review
Bangkok to Tel Aviv. Very old aircraft dirty and many features/items not working. Entertainment system appalling still projecting movies onto bulkhead screen and only radio options in seat. Too much cabin baggage allowed. Food surprisingly good although no frills like other carriers. Sparing with water but available on request. Lots of children on board so all bulkhead bassinets taken. Cabin crew did their best generally cheerful and accommodating. Long flight time but didn't have too many options to get to Tel Aviv was also expensive for economy class ticket. TLV security measures - be prepared and stay calm!

### El Al Israel Airlines customer review
I have been flying El Al since 1968 but the last trip was the worst. The seats are smaller than most airlines and my seat was next to the galley the noise and smells were horrible. Instead of the advertised dinner meal- they have switched it to just a sandwich - either egg or chicken smothered in peppers. Flight attendents were actually very rude and sarcastic and informed me Israelis eat their meal at lunch - assuming no one else flies this airline - and they said breakfast was better - horrible also. After 40 years of flying El Al I was so surprised - they always had great food and extra if you requested it. I did send a complaint letter and they called me and said they are trying this now because they do cater to Israelis and they like egg sandwiches for dinner. They said maybe they will "Sell" food - well after paying about $1300 they will give you a sandwich and hope you buy the better food?

### El Al Israel Airlines customer review
TLV-LAX-TLV. Extremely poor service for unaccompanied minors. Despite having paid the 75 USD unaccompanied minor fee (150 USD roundtrip) at the point of origin the agent at the check-in counter at LAX forced my children to pay it again on the return trip. This despite the fact that the airline record which I later obtained clearly showed the fee was paid round trip. The refund procedure has been another nightmare. Upon arrival at TLV the employee who was supposed to escort my children to the arrivals area released them without asking to see my ID and without requiring a signature. Very sloppy indeed.

### El Al Israel Airlines customer review

Bangkok to Tel Aviv. After the friendly attentive Thai service from Melbourne to Bangkok El Al was a stark contrast. The security at Bangkok was excessive. I appreciate the need for tight security but only non-Jewish/Israelis were cross-examined. The guy doing the questioning was rude. I was made to wait for about half an hour then taken to a downstairs room - with no explanation of what was happening. My bags and shoes were taken into a separate room for inspection. I felt the entire time that I was a criminal. Onboard the flight was totally packed and the FA's did the bare minimum. I didn't get my vegetarian meal - but luckily the breakfast meal was vegetarian (kosher) and quite tasty. I will avoid flying EL AL at all costs in the future.

The check-in security procedure is far too invasive including asking to see photographs on my camera itinerary on my laptop receipts etc. I understand the need for security but looking at personal photographs and items on my laptop is beyond ridiculous. The onboard service is mediocre food below mediocre and the quality of aircraft is below average - on two 6+ hour international flights we were subject to viewing in-flight entertainment on projection screens at the front of each section of the aircraft. My luggage was left in Tel Aviv even though there was a 5 hour layover.

AMS-TLV-AMS. The security procedures were not too tedious or invasive security people were friendly. We flew Melbourne to Amsterdam by a separate booking and one of my suitcases was lost before the El Al flight. Schiphol staff filed the complaint and told us to follow it up in Tel Aviv. The plane was an old 737 the food was not so good neither was the quality of the service. In Tel Aviv the lost and found department not only helped handle the luggage problem but gave me and my wife free toiletry kits with T-shirts underwear and all the basics not just a cheap disposable type. The luggage arrived to the place where we stayed safe and not tampered with. The flight back was still with 737 but better service and food. El Al FAs might appear rude not paying enough attention but you do need to know how to talk to them. Overall I'd rather fly a European or Asian airline but El Al is acceptable when required to go direct to Israel.

LHR-TLV return. The flights were busy but check in and security both ways quick and efficient. The staff questions were y polite and professional as were flight staff. The planes - ageing 767s - had no proper entertainment system but a better leg room pitch than usual in economy these days. Food quite poor. Overall: a much better experience than I had feared.

LHR to Tel Aviv return. Outbound on B777-200ER. Seats excellent PTV but I didn't bother with it. Economy over 80% full but staff attentive. After take off served drinks and nibbles followed by meal. Tel Aviv to LHR was a venerable 747 - dated but everything worked. Aircraft was full and cabin crew working flat out. The bargain was the seat upgrade - economy seats are fine but if there are seats free on board you can buy what's really a premium seat with about 48" legroom at bulkhead or exit rows - just $39.

International seats as small as domestic SAA. No drinks served understaffed food disgusting. Flying EL AL has been the worst experience of my life. Now I know what it means when they say you get what you pay for. I will gladly pay an extra few thousand rand next time to go another airline - but will never again fly EL AL. They are so concerned about their security issues they forget all about their customers. They make you feel like a criminal and treat you like a dog during flight.

EWR-TLV-EWR. First trip on new 777 almost full but we had the center seat empty. Food was good and hot. Comfy seats and minimal noise. Return delayed by an hour due to a broken lavatory door. No empty center seat this time and a "would not shut up" passenger next to me made this flight a lot less comfortable. Dinner good although served at 2-30 am! Used frequent flyer miles and the cost for two tickets was $155.00 US round trip.
