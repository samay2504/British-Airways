### "Avoid Alliance Airlines"
Went to check in and was told flight is delayed. No emails no phone call. At the check in counter they could not even tell me until when. I was told to download the Flight Aware app and monitor it. I asked for a time, and was told anywhere between 4.30 to 6.30. Never fly this airline again. This airline often cancelled last minute. Avoid Alliance Airlines

### "Please choose another airline"
Not Verified |   They often cancel flights at the last moment, and when asked for a reason, the management provides unsatisfactory responses. They also claim that, at the time of booking, they clearly mention that the airline has the right to cancel the flight at any moment. Make sure to have an alternate travel option other than this airline. I believe they operate like corporate scammers, holding our money and using it for 20-30 days without any interest. Please choose another airline for your travels. My flight was 9I-695 from Udaipur to Ahmedabad, scheduled for travel on 29-07-2024.

### "customer service was poor"
I have just flown alliance from Brisbane to Gladstone. The cabin crew did not smile, hardly spoke to any of the passengers and once in the air offered a glass of water in the first 10 minutes after takeoff and then both stood in the galley talking and not once walked down the aisle to see if any of the passengers needed anything. On disembarking at Gladstone they both stood in the galley with their backs to the passengers and never spoke to one passenger. The customer service was poor to nonexistent with very cramped seating. We will not fly with alliance again.

### "I could not fault Alliance"
Not Verified |  Today we flew on VA367 Brisbane to Townsville. I usually fly Jetstar as it suits my time requirements. This flight was perfect, the seats were much more comfortable and the staff were the best I have experienced, they could not have been more helpful. I could not fault Alliance in any way and I would always be happy with them . We had just flown from Perth and we were both pretty tired so thankyou so much.

### "majority of seats are vacant"
Not Verified |  Seating comfort is very poor. The business management of this airlines is very poor, because majority of seats are vacant. Simply increasing the fare daily. If the fare was law, 10 of my friends would have booked this flight instead of bus from Hyderabad to Mysore. Considering the standard of the flight, if the fare decrease the airlines may get more passengers. If the passengers are not sufficient, the management should decrease the fare the same day of flying and in that case it is better to have bargaining platform.

### "I would avoid this airline at all costs"
In booking this flight, there is no way to purchase more than 15kg per checked in bag on the website. Then when you arrive to check in I was promptly charged an extortionate amount for the excess weight. The ground staff were completely inflexible and only concerned about getting as much money from unsuspecting passengers as possible. The service on the plane was non-existent and I would avoid this airline at all costs.

### "don’t waste your time and money on this flight"
I am not able to do web check in and their customer care number is on hold for like an hour! Why should I face consequences due to their negligent behaviour. Booking for the first time and such a bad experience! Won’t regret writing this review! Please people don’t waste your time and money on this flight. Book other flights.

### "air hostesses were rude and busy in their own gossiping"
The airplane was supposed to take off at 15.35 but we flew late. During the entire journey the arc’s in the cabin were not working, with such hot weather outside and no AC in the cabin all the passengers were agitated and were sweating. The air hostess did not care and kept saying that it will work in 15-20min. The air hostesses were rude and busy in their own gossiping. Worst flight ever.

### "The seats were small"
Not Verified |  Port Macquarie to Brisbane. Dreadful. The age of the plane is ok, however the claustrophobic set up of the cabin is dreadful. The seats were small. We are average sized and were wondering how we were going to fit into the chairs. I have a chronic pain condition and within 20 minutes I was beside myself with being cramped into such a small place. No knee room, no room to reach anything in your handbag on the floor, barely can you put your tray table down. The water and white bread half sandwich was pretty random, not even a cup of tea. How on earth you fit so many overweight people in those seats is beyond me. What happens when large people book 1 seat? Which is the size of half a normal seat?

### "seem to be doing acceptable job"
Gladstone to Brisbane. I booked this flight through Virgin Australia website. But later I found out that Virgin ceased his service for some cities and gave it over to a new commercial airline called Alliance Airlines. The aircraft was a Fokker 70 with old interior look. The legroom was very tight. The airline's magazine was the only entertainment on board which hadn't been prepared tastefully. On the positive side, the crew were the most friendly cabin crew I've seen in Australian airlines. The complimentary snack (it was a 7:30am flight) was better than what Virgin used to offer. However, the only drink available was water. It is expected for an airline to offer coffee and tea in the morning, at least they can sell a few options on board. The flight time was shorter than usual as it wasn't a propeller aircraft. Handling at both airport was done by Virgin Australia so it wasn't really related to this review. Generally, it's good that a new competitor is entering the market. As a beginner in this sector, they seem to be doing acceptable job. But they should improve some issues to become a rival to other airlines in regional Australia.
