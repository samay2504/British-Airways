### "Aircraft was clean and cool"
Jayapura to Tanahmerah. Flight left and arrived on time. Aircraft was clean and cool, crew friendly, and even a simple inflight meal of a box of tea and a cake was provided.

### "Plane was comfortable enough"
Yahukimo to Jayapura. Flight was about an hour late - quite normal in this remote place. Plane was comfortable enough, with reclining seats and even a box of tea provided, unlike on the sole competitor's flights on this route.
