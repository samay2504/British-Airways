### Conviasa customer review
Madrid-Caracas in Business Class. At check-in confirmed Business Class Tickets and confirmed seats 1A and 1B but were assigned seats 36EF in Economy Class due to unknown reasons. After intervention got confirmed Business Class seats. Lounge was offered although was closed for refurbishment not the airlines fault however they should not that the lounge is closed. Inflight service very slow and basic seats seemed to come from the 70's no earphones no menu no travel kit no newspapers. Only inflight entertainment a movie in the middle of the flight - as no earphones available they put the movie sound through the PA system over the whole aircraft. No matter if you want to or not you must listen to the movie sound. Finally my bag did not arrive after a wait at baggage claim of 3 hrs to deliver the first bag.

### Conviasa customer review
Three trips between CCS and BLA. I found Conviasa to be clean modern friendly and welcoming. My Spanish is functional but quite basic and when I struggled there was usually multilingual staff even on the short hop from Caracas to Barcelona and back. Luggage allowance on this flight is a generous 30kg and a free drink is provided despite the flight time being only 30-40 minutes. Seats comfortable with more room than I was expecting. All in all Conviasa offer a superior - albeit slightly more expensive - service on this short route than do their competitors Avior.

CCS-PMV-GND (B732 and ATR42) Good service at the airport and on-board with Conviasa. Check-in staff could use some cheering up pleasantly surprised when offered a snack box on the PMV-GND flight flight attendants well dressed and good looking but was a little disappointed with the condition of the aircraft interior on the PMV-GND flight. I would be glad to fly on Conviasa again on the future.

Barcelona BLA to Caracas CCS in Venezuela on a classic Boeing 737-200 aircraft I experienced Conviasa to be quite nice to fly with. Anyhow they do not offer much more than the average European "no-frills" carriers. A cost-free non-alcoholic drink was served on that short domestic flight the aircraft was clean and fine despite its age we departed BLA about 15 minutes ahead schedule - not every airline in Venezuela manages that. Since the ticket costed me less than EUR 20- I can call it a quite satisfying experience!
