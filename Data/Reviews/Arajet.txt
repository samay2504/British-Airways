### "did not have a single issue"
Not Verified | We booked Arajet for our family vacation of 11 people. After booking we read the reviews of Arajet and were concerned but decided to keep our flight. I’m glad that we did. We did not have a single issue. Our flight was on time both ways. We did not have a single delay. The flight was smooth, the crew was kind, the plane was clean. We paid for our baggage ahead of time when we booked the tickets. It was cheaper that way. Luggage arrived on time with no issues. So many times people only leave negative reviews and we wanted to leave a review of our positive experience in the hopes this helps others.

### "worst airline I have ever used"
Not Verified |  The worst airline I have ever used. They charged me double for my return baggage compared to the price I paid on my outbound flight. They claim it's cheaper to check in bags online, but their website is absolutely terrible — I spent two hours at the airport trying to explain the issue to their staff. All they kept saying was, “Pay now and we’ll refund you later.” The refund came in the form of a voucher, forcing me to use their airline again, which I absolutely will not do. Terrible experience from start to finish.

### "asked for refunds 3 times now"
I had booked on their websites prior to boarding for checked bags, as they weren’t included in the ticket price. Although, after checking my credit card statement, I see that I was charged more than double the price. The price for 2 carry on bags in their website clearly says 80$, which is the service that I booked, for both of my flights (round-trip). I was charged 140$ instead of the agreed upon 80$ when booking for my flight back. That’s not even the worst. I was charged over 340$ for the same carry on that I had previously booked for what I thought was 80$, as their website says. So instead of paying 160$ for my carry on for the round-trip, they charged me almost 500$. I tried getting in contact with them as soon as I noticed the charges in my credit card but got no response whatsoever from them so I sent another email. They finally answered that email but keep ignoring my request for refunds of both the differences saying that the difference in prices is due to taxes. I have never heard of anywhere in the world where a purchase of 80$ comes to 140$ and 80$ comes to over 340$ because of taxes. I have asked for refunds 3 times now and they will not even acknowledge it. Instead, they only sent me a link to their guidelines which is in Spanish, knowing full well that our whole conversation had been in English. I have mentioned to them multiples times that if I do not get a refund I will escalate the situation further but they do not seem to care. I am now going to contact my credit card company to file a dispute with them. Their policies on refunds state that they will not refund taxes paid if they have already paid said taxes to their authorities. But I sent an email as soon as I landed back in Montreal and they did not answer me. So now I’m wondering, did they intentionally not answer me so they could say that their taxes were already filed and pay so they wouldn’t have to pay me back. I have also requested the proof that they have paid these taxes, since their policies specifically mentions them, but no answer in their part. They keep ignoring every single one of my requests and only replying with the link to their guidelines.

### "worst airline I have used"
The worst airline I have used in 15 years traveling with different airlines and the agents on the phone do nothing to resolve any situation that may arise. I do not recommend anyone to travel with Arajet. Worst airline ever. La peor aerolinea que he usado en 15 años viajando con diferentes aeroplanes y los agentes al telefono no hacer nada para resolver cualquier situacion que se presente no recomiendo a nadie viajar con arajet worst airline ever

### "Flying with them was a living nightmare"
On the airport they required vaccines, and when we showed them our card they claimed they "couldn't find" we had to sit there for almost an hour to show them where it was. The staff was extremely rude during this process, when in reality, they were the ones not being able to read the card that we presented with all the information in it, keep in mind that Brazilian vaccination cards are pretty standard, and it was spelled in capital letters, "Febre Amarela". They didn't even offer water on the 7-hour flight we took from GRU to PUJ; Brazilian law requires airlines to offer water in flight. The seats were extremely tight and uncomfortable. We paid for a larger seat on the way back, in which they did not let us sit there and pushed us back to the tight place, and still charged my card for the seat we were not able to use. Flying with them was a living nightmare from check-in until exiting the plane.

### "Do not fly with this airline"
Boarding process had delays with the computer system. Flight was delayed 2hrs in Punta Cana. Luggage was lost. Company rep stated my luggage arrived and was sent to me and they didn't even ask where we were staying. Company has lied a number of times in WhatsApp conversation. Customer service only response is to wait to hear from the area in charge but will not say who the area in charge is or any reps to talk to. No compensation is given or even offered. Do not fly with this airline.

### "cancelled and shuttled overnight to a hotel"
In September, I booked round trip flights for 3 people from Toronto to Mexico City (with layovers in the Dominican), round trip Dec 23-Jan 15. On December 10, our return flight was cancelled, we were sent $100 apology vouchers to use on Arajet’s website that expired Dec 12. Soon after checking in at YYZ for our departing flight on December 23 (originally set to leave at 17:55) it was announced that we were delayed by two hours. We waited for our flight until 20:00. Then the flight was cancelled and we shuttled overnight to a hotel. No one would tell us when the flight would be rescheduled for. They only told us what time we would return to the airport that evening at 22:30, we had to be out the door by 3:00. We boarded a shuttle at 3:00 back to the YYZ and waited 5 hours in line to check in because the airline's computers were not working and they had to manually input each passengers information. The flight was then delayed again from the flights first scheduled departure time of 7:30, the plane actually only took off at 14:45. Our flight YYZ to PUJ landed at 18:45. Again, we were not told when we would return for our flight to NLU, we spent hours at the airport while they sorted out what to do with us without telling us when our flight was the next day. For a second time, this was confusing and frustrating. I took out $60CAD worth of local Dominican Pesos at the airport because I did not know how long we would be in the country and wanted to be as prepared as possible in these bizarre circumstances. Eventually, we were shuttled to another hotel, at the hotel they told us when the shuttle would depart for the airport. We took a shuttle from the hotel at 9:00 to the airport in the morning. They couldn’t find record of our boarding passes so we stood in line for hours again as they sorted that out. When we did get to check in, we were told by the airport Arajet rep that our bags were not acceptable and even though they had been checked at YYZ we needed to pay again to check them in. I have receipts and paid $43.99USD x 3 originally to have additional bags for this trip. The airport representative claimed that our fees only covered one leg of the flight and wanted to charge us again $150USD x3 for bags we checked in easily at YYZ and were originally going to meet us direct in Mexico City. For an hour I tried to show my receipts and explain we had already paid a fine for additional bags. Eventually, fearing we would be late (the Christmas airport lines were extremely daunting) for our 13:13 flight, we bit the bullet, payed the extra fines for the bags, and decided on fast check in for $89.20CAD to make sure we made our flight only to find out our flight again was delayed until 15:23. We landed around 20:30 on December 25 instead of 9:00 on December 24. We missed 35 hours of our vacation as well as our Christmas plans and spent an extra $838.81CAD just dealing with additional hurdles imposed by Arajet’s lack of communication. Arajet have not responded to my email detailing the above information. However on December 26 they sent us (3 travellers) a single Arajet coupon worth $20USD to use on their website, the coupon expired on Dec 25 (the day before we received the email).

### "I do not recommend Arajet"
My flight from GRU (Jan, 1st / 25) to PUJ (Punta Cana) delayed by 2 hours before leaving São Paulo. As a result, we arrived in PUJ (Jan, 2nd / 25) few minutes before the schedule time of shuttle to SDQ (Santo Domingo), which did not wait for us. The Arajet ground staff in PUJ were not helpful at all, in fact, they were very ill-intentioned. We managed to resolve the problem through a person in the group of 40 people (who were waiting for the shuttle) who had contact with Arajet (a friend works at the airline's president's office) and after a 4-hour wait, two very poorly maintained and uncomfortable vans took us to SDQ. I do not recommend Arajet to anyone, not even my enemies.

### "makes Spirit feel like Emirates"
I don't have the time or the patience to go through all the problems I am having with this airline as I am stuck in transit and the problems are ongoing. I just what to say that I believe everything that has been written here about this garbage airline. If you have a problem, you will not get any support whatsoever. The attitude of employees of this airline is either' its not my job or I don't know or find someone else to deal with it. This was our first and it will be our last time flying with this airline. I have flown other budget airlines but this airline makes Spirit feel like Emirates. If I could give this airline a negative rating I would because a 1 seems generous.

### "$600 to change a name"
Not Verified |  I purchased a flight for my family for a trip. I made an error with one of my nephews last name and I called the airline immediately to change it. Cost $600. I have been traveling for over 40 years and never had an airline charge $600 to change a name 2 minutes after you book a flight. The ticket cost $582 and the name change cost $600.

### "the lock had been broken"
Not Verified |  When we landed in Cancun we found out that 15/20 bags had been destroyed to be opened. Nothing was missing but the lock had been broken hence the bag cannot be used anymore. I submitted a claim at the airport and it took them 18 days to offer me a refund of 40 dollars. The value of the luggage is around 200 dollars.

### "they don't care about you"
The flight went well, but when I arrived to Sao Paulo my suitcase disappeared, more surprising, we are 7 customer that are missing suitcase, I have learn later that the same flight that happened one week before, many customers get their suitcases open with missing items. Now we are one week later, no one gave me any news about my suitcase, there is no number and no one wrote to me anything. That's really suspicious, don't fly with them if you don't want to lose your suitcase. They just have ruined my travel, one year of backpacking, don't have anything more, no clothes, lost 20 films camera of my travel, the last memories of my mum. Worst company ever, they don't care about you

### "a five-hour delay"
Our flight was scheduled to depart from Buenos Aires at 4:25am on November 27th, but it didn’t take off until 9:25am, a five-hour delay. As a result, we were unable to catch our connecting flight back to Toronto that day. During the five-hour delay, no one offered us drinks or food. In addition, Arajet didn’t have a flight back to Toronto until the day after tomorrow, so we were forced to stay in the Dominican Republic for two nights.

### "Absolutely intolerable"
$124 surprise charge to check an underweight duffel bag on a 70 minute flight. Highway robbery! Arajet is a Caribbean discount airline I was flying as part of a group tour. There was a long line to check in, around 1 hour. When I was finally assisted by an agent, they said my ticket did not include any luggage, and I would have to pay. The fee, payable in local Dominican currency, equated to $116.82 USD and $18 in tax. Absolutely absurd and this surprise fee totaled almost what was spent on the ticket itself, but what could one do at that point? I've never paid more than $30 to check a bag anywhere, and I fly regularly internationally, and worked in the airline industry for several years. The plane was about half full, so the flight was actually enjoyable as I had an entire row of 3 seats to myself, but, as it took an hour to check in, and this was with all 4 checkin terminals staffed, if the plane was actually full, the check in time would have horribly intolerable. On top of this they fly the Boeing 737-MAX which is the one plane I try to avoid when traveling. Arajet is currently trying to expand flights to the USA. But whatever happens, remember the hostile attitude they have-the carrier's hostile customer service mindset will remain. I will never, ever fly this airline. Absolutely intolerable. The bottom line? Stay away, far far away from Arajet!

### "avoid providing the appropriate compensation"
On September 30, 2024, while at Ezeiza Airport in Buenos Aires, Argentina, I learned that my flight 336 to Toronto, Canada, was canceled just half an hour before departure. This cancellation significantly impacted our family reunion, reducing my stay in Canada and affecting my reservations there. The financial loss extends beyond the flight ticket to include my hotel expenses in Canada and potential income from my work. Additionally, we were unable to travel on another day due to my job starting on October 1. There has been multiple interactions with Arajet Customer service where Arajet is using different strategies to exhaust customers and avoid providing the appropriate compensation. For example, they refer customers to third parties: Expedia.ca has clearly stated (as noted on their website) that it is the airline's responsibility to issue the refund. It is inappropriate to shift this responsibility to third parties, especially when Arajet is the one that canceled the flight and received the payment (despite Arajet customer service denied it). It continues with one misleading comment after the other. The deliverate goal is taking responsibilities for letting customers left alone in airports and avoid paying. Arajet appears to be implementing strategies that discourage customers from pursuing reimbursement claims. Among these strategies, Arajet focuses on: 1) Complicated Claim Processes: The refund process is cumbersome, requiring extensive documentation that may deter passengers. In our case, we have provided all necessary documents. 2) Partial Refunds with Deductions: We experienced a situation where a ticket refund was issued with fees deducted (over $150), similar to what Arajet has done in our case. 3) Failure to Reimburse for Additional Purchases: Despite providing proof of purchases for luggage and seat selection made the day before departure, Arajet continues to disregard these issues with automated responses from customer service. 4) Leaving mothers with kids left alone in airports with a reschedule ticket in 3-4 days later with no supporting transfers or hotels. Our goals are: 1) Inform other customers of our experience, 2) Allow customers to make inform decisions by avoiding purchasing tickets with Arajet, 3) Obtain the reimbursement (proof of purchases ticket, seat selection, baggage, transportation to the airport/return were provided).

### "almost 200$ to have my carry on"
The first time flying with this company, ARAJET. Because I missed my flight. I usually fly with legacy airline about 5 to 7 time a year, mainly for business, and I only travel with a carry on so that save myself the trouble of running after my luggage. So I purchase a flight with only carry on but careful and read properly they redefined what is a "carry on" and got bill almost 200$ to have my carry on. ARAJET YOU ARE NOW BANNED AND I WILL LET MY WALLET TALK.

### "impressed for the service and attention"
My companion and I were impressed for the service and attention by the airline personnel and customer service. The flight was really smooth and easy. The price was very reasonable. Therefore, we did not expect any meal service.

### "I had a terrible experience"
I had a terrible experience with Arajet on my recent 7-hour overnight international flight. Despite the duration and timing of the flight, no water or food was offered, which is quite concerning for such a long journey. Additionally, the cabin temperature fluctuated drastically between extreme cold and extreme heat. To make matters worse, no blankets or pillows were provided, which is usually standard for overnight flights. On top of that, I was charged $100 for a carry-on bag, which was ridiculous. Overall, I found the service to be extremely lacking and would not recommend flying with Arajet ever.

### "never recommend this airline"
Not Verified |   Worst airline ever! No one cared to help me. My luggage got lost in Santo Domingo. No one knew anything. They placed the wrong gate on the monitor so about 10 of us missed our connecting flight. Got stuck in Santo Domingo and no one wanted to help us/me. Arajet just blamed the airport. I had no luggage nothing with me. I was later told I was out on a flight the next day and had to sleep on the airport floor because no one cared to help even though it was the airline’s fault. I would never recommend this airline. First and last time

### "my baggage wasn't there"
Not Verified |   Don't fly with this airline, they didn't put my baggage at the airplane and when I arrived at Dominican Republic my baggage wasn't there. I lost one day on my vacation cause all my personal items and clothes are there and filled a form at the airport also filled another form online and called with costumer service and nobody knows where is it and don't have any idea when I'm gonna have with me. Worst experience flying with this airline, they make a mistake, don't do anything to solve as soon is possible and they don't care

### “clearly has no interest in helping”
This is one of the most unprofessional airlines I have ever flown. Shortly after disembarking from my flight from Santo Domingo to Kingston, I realized that I had left my iPad in the seatback pocket. In the terminal, I searched and finally (with some difficulty) found an Arajet employee, who went away and eventually told me no one had removed any iPads from the flight. She could not offer any other advice for recovering it. I subsequently made many attempts to contact Arajet. No one answered when I called their published "customer service" phone numbers. I then had an extensive online chat with someone, but she finally reprimanded me for losing my iPad and said if anyone ever found it on the plane and turned it in to the Lost and Found in Santo Domingo, I would have to go there and prove my identity. When I offered to pay to have it shipped to me, she said they would not do that. Over the subsequent days, my Apple "Find My" app continued to show that the iPad was at the airport in Santo Domingo. But writing Aerojet resulted in no help of any sort. They appear to lack personnel who can communicate in English. I'm sorry I forgot my iPad. I did not mean to do that. But passengers DO forget things and Arajet clearly has no interest in helping them get their possessions back. The entire operation reeks of disrespect for passengers.

### "worst experience ever"
This is the most unprofessional and horrible airline I have ever used in my life. The worst customer service, the worst underground crew, worst reception and worst personel at the airport. I purchased a flight from Toronto to Sao Paulo. I was supposed to fly in June 12, but due to some issues I decided to change my flight to June 4. I was told that I would be charged 75 Canadian dollars as penalty. I agreed because this is my decision. So during the change, I did a mistake by choosing June 6 and the payment was done already. When I realised it immediately I called the customer service to help me out, I got rude customer agents and telling me that I still have to pay another 75 Canadian dollar, for the new change, they said they don't care about the mistake and I should pay. I finally paid. On the day of the flight, the fare I purchased was allowed me a 10kg baggage, but during my check-in, I was informed rudely that I have to pay 140 Canadian dollars to be able to fly. I tried everything by even showing the fare I purchased on Arajet website. The lady told me rudely: <>. Also the flight has a 4 hours delay. They sell food in the plane, no snack is free, even water you have to buy. It was my first time to fly with this airline, but the worst experience ever. I will never ever take it again.

### "worst airline I have used"
Arajet is the worst airline I have used. There was a man who took photos of my documents, passport and residence card with his personal cell phone. This has never happened to me with Air Transat or Air Canada. I don't think it's safe. He told me it was to send to the Santo Domingo team. I thought my problems were over when I finally boarded the plane, but it was only the beginning. The seats are stuck, no water is given. A bottle of water costs 2 US dollars. I bought a chicken and potato dish for 12 US dollars, but I couldn't eat it, it was not good. For my return, I had to return earlier than planned because my son was sick. I changed my ticket on the website and had to pay a fee of 270.88 Canadian dollars. I spent three days trying to pay on the website but couldn't. So I called customer service. When I called customer service, there was an agent who told me there was a problem with MasterCard. This is why payment cannot be made. Well, afterwards, I tried with a Visa card, but that too didn't work. I called again, and there was another agent who left me on the line alone for about 20 minutes, under the pretext that he was looking for a solution. Eventually, I found another person who informed me that payment issues often happen on the Arajet website. He advised me, as I was in Santo Domingo, to go directly to a Pagatodo office. Upon arriving at the Pagatodo office, I was informed that I had to pay in Dominican pesos. I was supposed to pay $270.88 Canadian, but was charged 16,250 Dominican pesos, which works out to about $375 Canadian. It's incredible ! It's theft, there is no coordination, they are amateurs, they are not serious. I do not recommend this airline at all. They say their flights are cheaper, but the price goes up quickly for everything and you end up with a higher price than other standard airlines and very poor service.

### "ineligible for a refund"
Not Verified |   The absolute worst airline I have ever flown with. They sent me an email the day before my flight telling me my flight had been delayed by 1 hour and when I went to the empty check in desk of an empty airport 2 hours before the new departure time I was told that check in was closed (3 hours before departure). When I asked for a refund, the response I received was that they recommend I arrive 3 hours prior to departure and because I was there 2 hours before I was ineligible for a refund. Their policies however state otherwise. And this is the biggest issue. There were so many more - like being unable to check in online and it being framed as my fault for not calling despite using one of their contact numbers, being told we don't need an eticket for transit but then being stuck in the airport as we tried to navigate a system that made no sense. I was actually really excited about this airline and was telling everyone to use it but I have since told them to avoid it at all costs.

### “Highly avoid this airline”
Do not recommend this airline at all. They are unprofessional and have a very poor customer service. I arrived to the Lima international airport at 2:30am for an international flight planned for departure at 5:00am. The counter was not announced for this airline at the airport, they had no representative at the airport and their online check in did not work. I was not able to get a boarding pass. I asked other airline reps if they know where the counter is and they said if it’s not announced it means the counter is not open yet. I messaged the airline customer service via what’s app at 3:45am about the situation, and they were not helpful at all! It looked like she is the only person working for this company. All she said was that she has escalated the issue and did not provide me with the boarding pass or the counter number and I ended up losing the flight. She said the counter was closed at 4:15am and why we did not message them earlier! I have had many international flights and never seen an airline so unprofessional and poorly managed. Highly avoid this airline if you respect your time and money.

### “Excellent service”
Excellent service and On time performance from Arajet for my recent travel from Toronto to Santo Domingo. Clean and new aircraft with friendly staff along with excellent competitive price.

### "customer service is limited"
Arajet onboard service is quite good. Planes were clean, staff courteous and attentive. On-board menu limited, but affordable (cash only). Offer lower fares than some others. Santo Domimgo airport is terrible and Arajet onboard and airport staff either don't know or give false information about the process. The transit desk closes early, despite the airport being open 24 hr. You need to collect bags and clear customs. You cannot re-enter the secure zone until 2 hours prior to your conmection. Landside, seating is very limiter and at restaurants only. Airport staff are rude and don't care to be helpful. If Arajet wants to make Santo Domingo a hub, they need to work with the airport to ensure a pleasant customer experience. Unfortunately, customer service is limited (form letter response), no office at the airport, local contact number only, very limited chat bot. Would avoid as a connecting hub, good if you want to fly directly to/from Santo Domingo.

### "Amateurs and not professional"
Not Verified |  Absolutely terrible. February 9 we we supposed to fly. The Departure Screen was not showing terminal nor gate all the way until we flew out. Same with the website. No flight information anywhere including their own app or website. spent extra hour running around between terminal 3 and 2 and then finally rep from another air line told us where to go. When we finally made it to the counter and I asked what is going on, the answer was: oh we are new airline and Airpost for some reason did not post our flight. No apology, nothing. Please save yourself from stress and do not use Arajet. Amateurs and not professional

### "Seats were comfortable"
Flight got delayed 1 hour, but we still reached on time in SDQ. The pilots were good. We had usb slots to charge our phone, no in flight entertainment or any screens in flight. The food/drinks menu were limited, and they only accepted cash that too in Dominican pesos or USD or CAD. The flight attendants were pretty good and fast, overall good service. Washrooms were clean, and had adequate things in it. Seats were comfortable. I feel like the seats starting 4th row, had less space, me and friend were in 3rd row, so had no issues, with leg space or otherwise. Landing and take off were perfect, and we clapped and laughed on landing. I felt really good on this flight. My next flight from Santo Domingo airport to Toronto airport, I was in 10th row, and leg space was okay for a 5 foot 10 inch guy, seats were good too, the problem, comes when the person in front of you reclines there seat, and you are sitting upright, you are 10 inches away from there hair. Also there was no usb ports to charge phone in DM716 flight from Santo Domingo airport to Toronto airport DM1284 where Boeing 737MAX8 is used from Mexico City to Santo Domingo airport is really good. DM716 from Santo Domingo airport to Toronto airport is not okay with caveats. I paid extra $60USD for carry on baggage.
