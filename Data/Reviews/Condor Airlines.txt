### "a really great product"
What a really great product, a pleasant change to the usual Frankfurt offering on this route. Service was great on board as was the catering, a hot meal on a 2 hour flight which is substantially better than the usual business class in Europe. We even got Skywards miles for this flight.

### "be aware of their policies"
I recently had to cancel a flight with Condor Airlines over two months in advance due to my wife's pregnancy. We provided a doctor’s note stating she was unable to travel, yet we were told that only taxes would be refunded, despite their website stating a 20% cancellation fee for trips canceled 60+ days prior. This crucial detail was buried deep in their 40+ page terms and conditions, making it incredibly misleading. Customer service was unhelpful and unwilling to assist. When I requested to speak with a manager, I was denied with no explanation. Condor’s lack of transparency and rigid policies make it difficult to trust them. If you’re considering booking with them, be aware of their policies and poor customer service.

### "suitcases had not come along"
Not Verified |  We had requested wheelchair assistance for my 86-year-old mother. After a short bus ride, we entered through a side entrance to make our way to the plane. We had to push the wheelchair ourselves because there wasn't enough staff. We were briefly directed to the lift up, then right, and after customs to gate 48. Upon arrival for boarding, we reported to the disabled care where they let us through to check paperwork. Something was wrong, and we had to go back behind the tape. He said he would resolve it but was busy with other things. We were ignored during several attempts to make contact. After 30-45 minutes, another person came who I managed to approach, and he let us back in but saw an error message. Condor had made a mistake and had not debited enough money and we had to make up for that. This had already been arranged the day before. I had proof of copies with me. It would not have been paid and my evidence was not interesting. Paying double if necessary was also not a solution. We were told if we wanted to stand behind the tape again. After a lot of wrangling, only my mother and I would be able to come along and my son had to stay behind to come 4 days later. Unacceptable, we have done nothing wrong and are treated like this. My 86-year-old mother was crying and almost in shock. She tried to separate us to stop my son from leaving. There was overbooked and absolutely no place left. I didn't settle and was very angry, after a lot of stress and harsh words, my son was finally able to come along. Once we arrived at the Puerto Plata it turned out that suitcases had not come along. This took so much extra stress and time. We were the last to come out of the airport. Just terrible. But it could be worse Because after 4 days without suitcases we received the message today that they had forgotten our suitcases and it will take until next week.

### “nothing short of a disaster”
I wish I could give Condor Airlines zero stars. One thing to say about me, I have never written a bad review to anyone. My experience with their baggage handling, customer service, and onboard experience has been nothing short of a disaster. My bag was lost on a direct flight from Frankfurt to Antigua—a route with no layovers, where losing a bag should be nearly impossible. The lack of communication, accountability, and urgency from Condor has been appalling. After six days of emails and follow-ups, I still don’t have my bag or a clear plan for when it will arrive. While I received an email stating my bag was found in Frankfurt, the lost baggage report has not been updated, and no one seems to know how or when it will be delivered. Meanwhile, I’ve been forced to buy essentials—clothing, toiletries, and other items—since my bag contained critical gear for my trip, including hiking, snorkeling, and scuba diving equipment. Adding to the frustration, Condor has no representatives at the Antigua airport to handle these issues, and their response has been to direct me to a third-party website that provides little to no useful updates. When asked for contact information for the person handling my bag, I was met with silence. On top of this, I’ve incurred significant additional costs—taxi rides across the island to buy items, pricey laundry services, and inflated prices for basic necessities in the Caribbean. To make matters worse, most local businesses here don’t issue formal receipts, leaving me wondering if Condor will even reimburse these expenses. Their website vaguely states passengers are entitled to purchase urgently needed items within a “statutory maximum liability,” but Condor refuses to clarify what this actually means or how much I can spend. The onboard experience wasn’t any better. The food served during the flight was the worst airline food I’ve ever had in my life. It was bland, tasteless, and barely edible. For an airline positioning itself as a quality long-haul carrier, this was beyond disappointing. The most shocking part? I’ve met other passengers in Antigua who have been waiting for their bags since December 17th! This demonstrates that Condor has no reliable system in place to handle delayed baggage, nor do they seem to care about resolving these issues promptly. My holiday has been completely disrupted because of Condor's incompetence. Instead of enjoying my time, I’m stuck dealing with the stress of washing the same limited clothing, coordinating with an unresponsive airline, and spending money I didn’t plan for. Avoid Condor Airlines at all costs. Losing a bag on a direct flight, providing abysmal food, and showing complete indifference to customer satisfaction is beyond unacceptable. If you value your time, money, and sanity, fly with a different airline. Verdict: Unreliable, unprofessional, and not worth the hassle. Condor has no excuse for this kind of service. Save yourself the stress and choose another carrier.

### “Please read the reviews first”
Not Verified | Please read the reviews first, don’t make our same mistakes. Before buying tickets with them get some info about this company actually, for me it was the worst company I have ever travelled with - they charge you for headphones - they don’t accept cash - the seat maps on the app while doing check in is not corresponding with the real plane - charges for choosing a standard seats for no reasons. The plane was dirty where we were sitting both ways - cabin staff, some of them were nice, some of them not so friendly and didn’t like to speak English.

### "they refuse to accept cash"
It's an absolute shame. We are on the flight and want to order food but they refuse to accept cash so I want to pay with my maestro card and they also refuse it because it is not a German maestro card. As far as I know, maestro is maestro, it doesn't matter which one it is. This is why we had to starve for 5 hours. Een regelrechte schande is het. We zitten op de vlucht en willen eten bestellen maar ze weigeren cash geld aan te nemen dus wil ik betalen met mijn maestrokaart en die weigeren ze ook omdat het geen Duitse maestro kaart is. Bij mijn weten is maestro maestro maakt niet uit welk het komt.hierdoor hebben we 5 uur lang honger moeten lijden

### "I didn't agree to pay"
I am writing this letter to express my disappointment as an Air Condor customer. On September 28 th I traveled from Toronto to Frankfurt. I am 66 years old woman with a medical condition and I was asked several times to move to the end of line since I didn't agree to pay a ridiculous fee of $ 225 for my carry on luggage. Instead, I was told to check in my carry on as a second luggage. My carry on was 8 kg as the policy states and my checked in bag weighted 23 kg. I also had my purse which contained important medication for my medical condition and essentials for the long overseas trip. I was forced to stay in line for over an hour by the Condor employee since I was complaining about the carry on. I showed my email that stated the flight was fully booked and we can check in our carry on luggage free of charge. The worker rudely disregarded my claim. Since my family had left the airport, I texted them to help me pay the luggage fee online. Unfortunately, the website was broken and my son said it showed a message that in that case we don't have to pay and I attached email as well. I never had issue with my luggage specifically carry ones. It was an extremely disappointing experience.

### "never been so poorly treated by any airline"
Not Verified | We were re-routed onto this flight as our previous flight had been cancelled. Our luggage was not transferred from Swiss Air to Lufthansa in Milan Italy, so our baggage was flown to Zurich with virtually no way to make it to LA in a timely manner. We have AirTags in our luggage so I have been able to track where the bags are and have been. Both pieces of luggage were kept in Zurich Friday evening and then on Saturday were flown to LA. The luggage was received in LA late Saturday evening and is still at this writing Sunday afternoon, sitting in LA, allegedly to be delivered tomorrow when both my wife and I have to return to work and will not be here to receive them. I even offered to go pick up the bags myself in LA and was told that they would not be released to me. Over the course of the weekend since our flight on Friday, I have emailed Condor three times and have not received so much as even a courtesy response. I have called and spoken to Condor's mislabeled "customer service" only to be hung up on three times. I have asked to be transferred to a supervisor or higher up in order to try to resolve this circumstance and have either been hung up on or told that they don't have anything to do with baggage, that there is no number to call to speak to someone about delayed baggage, and that no supervisors were available. In the meantime our bags are sitting in LA some 30-40 miles away being held captive by Condor's baggage handlers and or (and I hesitate to call it) service. I have flown quite a number of times with a variety of different carriers and never have I been so poorly treated by any airline and their employees as I have in this circumstance with Condor Airlines. I give one star reviews only because it is the lowest offered rating.

### "pay 250 Canadian Dollars for my bag"
I wish there was an option to give zero stars, and not one. I booked a flight through WestJet, who apparently partner with Condor (no clue why). I called the night before my flight to make sure that I had a checked bag included in my fare (if I didn't, I wanted to pay for one, as they are cheaper if you buy them before you get to the airport). I was told by the customer service representative that I did have a checked bag included in my fare. I pay for a seat (window seat) ahead of time, as I cannot sleep in any seat other than a window. I arrive to the airport the next day to be told by someone at the check-in desk that I do not have my checked bag included and will have to pay 250 Canadian Dollars for my bag, which is absolutely insane. I tell her I spoke to customer service and they told me I have a bag, and she said there's nothing she can do about that. She also told me I could upgrade to premium economy and have the bag included for 150 (bizarre pricing options but ok). I call customer service again and am told again that I do have a bag included, but she says that if I pay for the bag, I will be reimbursed. This is starting to feel sketchy to me, so I ask for proof of that in writing, over email, she says no. I ask for a recorded copy of the call, she says no. I ask her if I pay for premium economy (since its cheaper, and if I do end up getting scammed by all of this at least I will have had more leg room) if I will still be reimbursed since its actually cheaper than the checked bag fee, and she says yes. I go back to the counter, pay to upgrade and mention that I already paid for a window seat and would like a window seat since I already paid for one. I file all of my claims for the reimbursement before I board. Arrive on the flight: I have a middle seat, and the "Premium Economy" seats are smaller than some economy seats that I have sat in on other airlines and are incredibly uncomfortable, and the food is worse. I can't sleep at all on the flight. I continue to check in on my claim in the following weeks and am told very rudely by a customer service representative that I need to be 'more patient' because it could take up to 6 weeks to respond to my claim; this information was not mentioned anywhere or by anyone. I finally get a response to my claim, and it was denied, as they 'do not provide retroactive reimbursements for baggage fees', even though I was clearly told by a customer service representative that they did. The final line of that email was that they 'would be delighted if I would fly with condor again'...fat chance. I hope everyone considering Condor reads this and realizes that it would be so much more worth it to fly with literally any other airline. What a waste of my time and money.

### "zero care factor from Condor"
I booked with Condor to fly LHR - YYC - YYJ on 30 July 2024, returning YYJ - YYC - FRA - PRG on 19 August 2024. On the morning of 19 August, I did not receive any SMS or email notifications, despite having provided both contact points, to discover that WS 206 was not showing up for departure. I contacted the Condor helpline number to be advised by a helpful staff member that I had been rescheduled on a flight the next day. There was no notification from Condor and the staff member I spoke to said there would be no contact from them. I incurred an additional night accommodation in Victoria at CAD325 plus meals, lost my requested and paid for, seat allocation on the original YYC-FRA flight and my seat selection on the aisles ensuring my personal comfort on the 9 hour flight. Condor's response: They tell us that their flight to Calgary was delayed. This flight was operated by Westjet Airlines. This airline is therefore your point of contact. We would like to ask you to contact them as the cause of the delay. When I was rescheduled, I flew a different route with Lufthansa, where staff were completely disinterested in my payment of additional seat service and would not assist with a relocation to an aisle seat. There was zero care factor from Condor, no refund or apology. I would not use this airline in the future.

### “an excellent aircraft”
I will stay away from most recent reviews. I have only one severe criticism and that costs them a star: check-in luggage per person in business class of only 30 kg between Europe and the new world (Caribbean in this case). More for a fee depending on how much you want to take. Most decent Airlines, even EW Discover (let alone famous carriers like Air France and many others) allow you 2 X 32kg per person. That has to change, absolutely! All the rest was plainly EXCELLENT. Their ranking around 2 stars has become obsolete. The fleet has been completely renewed, brand new A330’s replacing the old faithful Boeing 767, otherwise an excellent aircraft.

### "never fly with Condor again"
Not Verified |  This have been such a bad experience. We booked with a travel agent so it was not even our choice to go with Condor, this will be the last time though. For starters, it was not clear how much luggage we had to choice on their website, we called, the lady on the phone was so rude and could not help us. so we did as she said and paid just for the luggage which was 2 hand luggage (8kg) and 2 for in the plane (21 kg) we already had 20 kg included in our deal with the travel agent. We paid extra and that was over the €200 for our luggage. When we were at the departure the lady at the counter was shocked that we paid this much for it and said to us it wasn’t necessary, so I looked up their customer service. I called numerous times, no answer.. I send a couple of emails., no answer, 12 days later we received a mail, that it was normal to pay this fee. I will never fly with Condor again.

### "Very bad in everything"
Not Verified |   Very bad in everything: Baggage handling, delay, poor communication. Unwelcome feeling. Unfriendly staff. If you exceed your baggage allowance, you are the loser. No alternative is offered than to take out your wallet. Never again Condor. Zeer slecht in alles: Bagageafhandeling, vertraging, slechte communicatie. Onwelkom gevoel. Onvriendelijk personeel. Bij overschrijding bagage ben je de klos. Er wordt geen alternatief geboden dan je portemonnee trekken. Nooit weer Condor.

### "Absolutely terrible experience"
Not Verified |   Absolutely terrible experience with Condor. The call center is completely incompetent. Spent over five hours at the airport getting the runaround by the customer service department. Completely ruined our trip. I was even hung up on by the Agent. I will never fly with Condor Airlines again!

### "did not feel customer-friendly"
I was initially recommended to fly with Condor Airlines based on a positive experience a friend had two years ago, flying from Toronto to Frankfurt. She praised their customer service, from the check-in counter to the flight itself. Unfortunately, my experience was quite different when I flew from Toronto. Long Wait Times and Inconsistent Customer Service Upon arrival at Toronto Pearson Airport, I was met with long wait times in the queue and inconsistent customer service from the check-in agents. The first agent I encountered was friendly and made an effort to welcome me to the airline. However, an issue with my baggage weight arose, and despite her best efforts, I had to adjust my luggage. Due to a decision by her manager, I had to redo the luggage weight and carry-on, forcing me to start over by rejoining the line. Unprofessional and Rude Behavior When it was my turn again, the first agent took her break, and I was assisted by a different agent. Although she seemed more experienced, she was significantly less friendly. She made me feel unwelcome by asking me to remove the passport covers from my family’s passports, making it seem like I had done something wrong. Her instructions on how to handle the carry-on luggage were unclear and frustrating. Eventually, I had to discard my carry-on luggage to fit my items into a personal backpack. Despite my compliance, this agent tore off the approved hand-carry tag and threatened to flag me for trying to carry another bag in bad faith. She failed to inform me that I needed to get my hand-carry tagged again during our dispute. When my wife politely asked for her name to submit a customer service inquiry, the agent told her "to go to hell" and then proceeded to call the next customer. Unresolved Issues at the Boarding Gate The situation worsened at the boarding gate, where I was flagged for not paying the overweight fee. The agent’s manager insisted that I had not followed directions and ignored the incident where the agent told my wife to "go to hell. It was disappointing that the manager chose to protect the agent’s unprofessional behavior rather than address the issue. Final Thoughts on Condor Airlines While some Condor Airlines staff were professional and genuinely tried to help customers, my overall experience was negative. The unprofessional behavior of one agent and the manager’s defense of such conduct made for a frustrating and disappointing experience. Condor Airlines did not feel customer-friendly, and the fact that I ended up paying an overweight fee due to this poor service only added to my dissatisfaction. Despite the flight being delayed, which likely cost the airline more money, the unprofessionalism I encountered left a lasting negative impression. I do not recommend flying with Condor Airlines, especially with the staff at the Toronto Pearson International Airport.

### "pay a small backpack"
The worst airline that I have ever taken. They obliged me to pay a small backpack that had the correct measures. They didn’t want to check it and I had to pay 75 CHF. They were so unfriendly and I had to pay even when my backpack met the requirements. The flight was also so expensive. Never again!

### "cabin was uncomfortably hot"
We flew Los Angeles to Frankfurt, Germany and back in Condor's business class. The aircraft was a fairly new A330-900. The lie-flat seats were a bit narrow (17 inches at shoulders height) but everything works well (lights, entertainment, power ports). The entertainment choices included a lot of old movies and a couple movies from last year. The food was good (for airplane food) although there was almost nothing available between meals. The cabin was uncomfortably hot, even after they turned off the lights for sleeping the temperature was 25° C to 26° C (77°F-79°). The crew tried to lower the temperature but couldn't. One crew member told us they were having this problem with the new Air Bus 339 aircraft. It seems like Condor has fewer crew members than competing airlines so bathrooms were cleaned less often and when we pushed the service button it took 10 minutes for a crew member to respond. Condor passengers can use the Lufthansa lounges which are nice in Europe so that is a benefit. We will probably try to book a different airline next trip.

### "how hot the cabin was"
The only thing I remember about our business class experience was how hot the cabin was. My family of 4 was hot. It made the whole experience quite unpleasant, and I'm already dreading the flight home. There are no air vents, so i had to pour water on their silly socks and wet my head to cool off. A request to adjust temperature and was denied. The staff were okay, not overly friendly, but the main reason I won't be flying Condor ever again was just how uncomfortable the flight was.

### “Avoid them at all cost!”
Not Verified | Garbage airline where they charge you for everything! I called them in advance to see how much I would pay for a second checked bag only to get a different ridiculous amount at the time of my check in. $502 for a second checked bag is ridiculous and criminal! Avoid them at all cost!

### "recommend this airline"
Not Verified |   The flight arrived early, leaving a smile in everyone faces. The food was incredibly delicious, well exceding my expectations. Legspace was good, and the ticket price was really good for the flight. Really nice crew. Definitely recommend this airline.

### "$180 to check one bag."
Not Verified |   Can't check a bag online. Checked it at the airport and got the sticker shock of paying $180 to check one bag. That is criminal. They charge per kilo. Flight wasn't cheap. We will get the privilege of paying that going back too! The rest of the flight was average, not great. Just expect to get gouged.

### "customer service is so abysmal"
Not Verified | DO NOT FLY CONDOR! We bought business class tickets from NY to Athens with a layover in Frankfurt but we were only issued business class tickets from NY to Frankfurt. I understand that smaller planes do not necessarily have separate cabins but we weren't given priority boarding or priority luggage or lounge access which is ridiculous. We paid 100% of the fee for business class but only benefited from business on part of the flight. On the way home there WAS a business class but again, only our flight from Frankfurt were we seated in business. Although the ticket was issued by Condor, I had to call the second carrier to make sure we were in front of the plane so we could make our connecting flight, Condor refused any responsibility. And I paid extra for the seats! No priority boarding and, more importantly, no priority tags on our luggage. And our luggage did not get to New York. Their customer service is so abysmal. We had to call multiple times and they are beyond rude and nasty. Truly the worst airline.

### "A total ripoff"
Not Verified |   Beware that if you book business class that has a connecting flight you will only be in business for part of the trip. You will pay 100% of the business class fare and only travel half of it in business. Nor will you have access to the lounge in your connecting airport. A total ripoff.

### "Very disappointed in Condo"
Very disappointed in Condor. You don't expect much for the money, but this was below par. Situation: we are waiting at the gate for an hour. The flight is delayed by half an hour. The passengers are then boarded in 5 minutes and we are the last group allowed to board. Then we run into a problem: we have not booked a return flight because of our road trip and that is required to enter the US with an ESTA (we had one). Fine, then we will book it immediately! However, since the plane had to leave in a hurry, we did not even have 5 minutes to book a return flight. Ultimately, due to a mistake that was relatively easy to solve, we became the victims of Condor's poor planning and execution. There is then some discussion among the service center employees about how to resolve this situation. Ultimately, the employee we contacted decides that we have to pay a €400 rebooking fee per person. It is extra sad that after we have done this (we have no other choice) that another Condor employee comes to us and states that he could have solved it for €100 per person... It is truly scandalous to be treated this way and with such exorbitant to incur costs. Our advice is to book a more expensive flight. Zeer teleurgesteld in Condor. Voor het geld verwacht je niet veel, maar dit was beneden alle peil. Situatie: wij zitten een uur bij de gate te wachten. De vlucht is een halfuur vertraagd. De passagiers worden vervolgens in 5 minuten geboard en wij zijn de laatste groep die mag boarden. Vervolgens lopen we tegen een probleem aan: wij hebben vanwege onze roadtrip geen terugvlucht geboekt en dat is vereist om de VS met een ESTA (die hadden we) binnen te komen. Prima, dan boeken we die direct! Echter, aangezien het vliegtuig met grote haast moest vertrekken kregen wij niet eens 5 minuten de gelegenheid om een retourvlucht te boeken. Uiteindelijk zijn wij dus door een foutje dat relatief makkelijk op te lossen was, de dupe geworden van de slechte planning en uitvoering van Condor. Vervolgens ontstaat er enige discussie onder de medewerkers van het servicecenter hoe deze situatie op te lossen. Uiteindelijk beslist de medewerkster waar wij contact mee hebben dat wij €400 rebooking fee moeten betalen per persoon. Extra zuur is dat nadat wij dit gedaan hebben (we hebben geen andere keus) dat een andere medewerker van Condor naar ons toekomt en stelt dat hij het voor €100 pp had kunnen oplossen.. Werkelijk schandalig om zo behandeld te worden en met zulke exorbitante kosten opgescheept te worden. Boek een wat duurdere vlucht is ons advies.

### “it was an absolute nightmare”
Not Verified | I had the misfortune of flying with Condor Airlines recently, and let me tell you, it was an absolute nightmare. From the moment I stepped foot in the Frankfurt airport, I was greeted with incompetence and rudeness. The icing on the cake was this lady with glasses at the boarding gate to Calgary. Instead of efficiently checking people in, she decided to pick a fight with a passenger over the size of his carry-on. Did she think it was more important to prove a point than to ensure the smooth flow of boarding? Apparently so. Thanks to her lack of common sense and problem-solving skills, we were left scrambling to make our flight, almost missing it entirely. Condor Airlines seriously needs to reconsider their hiring and training practices if they want to avoid subjecting their customers to such utter chaos and frustration. Avoid at all costs unless you enjoy unnecessary stress and delays.

### "Confusing Rules, Extra Charges"
Confusing Rules, Extra Charges, and a Lot of Hassle. We booked a five-day vacation to Tenerife, including 20 kg of checked baggage and a standard carry-on per person through our regular travel agency. Condor's confusing app information led us to call the Condor customer service to confirm their baggage policies. They insisted we book two additional 8 kg carry-ons, which we did and paid. We carefully packed an official Samsonite carry-on that met Condor's stated dimensions and a small backpack and the check-in suitcase. At Düsseldorf, the check-in agent wrongly claimed our official Samsonite carry-on was oversized and urged us to book extra checked luggage for the return flight to avoid additional fees. We reluctantly contacted Condor's customer service while on vacation to sort out the confusion, but they assured us our baggage was indeed within their limits and no extra booking was needed. The agent even advised us to contact our travel agency to make a note of this in the Condor system. We did so but the travel agency informed us they did not have access to Condor systems which makes sense. Just to be safe from any issues flying home, we paid €125 to Condor for 30 kg of extra checked luggage. After which we contacted Condor support again where they reassured us everything was booked and we were now allowed to carry two carry-ons and max 3 check-in luggage (max weight per piece 32 kg). At the airport for our return flight, Condor staff aggressively charged every party of passengers in front of us in line for excess baggage. Our 23.5 kg checked suitcase, well within the 32 kg per piece and total 50 kg limit paid check-in luggage was also flagged as overweight. Despite having two small carry-on bags and 20 kg less than our 50 kg allowance, the agent tried to demand extra fees. When challenged, she threatened to deny boarding until a supervisor intervened and acknowledged we had complied. Condor's incompetence, contradictory information, and aggressive fees turned our vacation into a stressful ordeal. Avoid Condor if you value your time, money and sanity.

### “food was very poor”
There was no blanket and no earphones, it looks like they ran out of them, in fact I saw that they distributed them up to a couple of rows in front of me, and because it was cold I had to use my own scarf instead. The food was very poor and of bad quality. Thankfully they offer a lot or beverages. For a long-distance flight is not acceptable that even in the economy class is the space for each seat too narrow. So given the tickets’ price it would be expected better services, that were not offered.

### “portions of food were terrible”
Our flight from Frankfurt to Prague was canceled by Condor for no reason. We were in time at the gate and we were unable to board second plane. In the cabin we had to pay for wine, headphones etc... The portions of the food in comparison to other airlines were terrible. I was hungry. Seats were uncomfortable. Again in comparison to other airlines. The planes was not cleaned... I am not choosing this airlines ever again.

### "tricked into paying more for a change"
I was declined check-in because daughter's passport was expiring less than 30 days before the return date (which is fair) so I agreed to get her return flight rebooked. As soon as I paid an extra $400 for the ticket changed I was told the cut-off time to check in has passed and I won't make it to the flight and that it can be rebooked again online but not at the counter. The agent refused to help further. Upon calling condor helpdesk I was told the flight can't be rebook at all, so not only did I end up paying for a ticket I wasn't able to use, I was also tricked into paying more for a change that didn't let me use this ticket.

### "never book with this airline again"
I will never book with this airline again. A few minutes after checking in my suitcase, I was told that all flights were canceled due to snowfall. After 5 hours we were told that there would be no more flights. It can happen, this is force majeure. I called Condor several times, but each time they had no information about replacement flights or other solutions. I would receive a call back or an email. Neither happened. I could pick up my suitcase the next morning at 5:00 am. I also had to arrange a hotel myself, but due to the weather, no means of transport could be arranged and there was no other option than to sleep at the airport. We were given no drinks, food or blankets. It was too cold to sleep. The queues at the restaurants were 2 hours just to place an order. The next morning at 5:00 am I was at the baggage service desk, along with dozens of other passengers. The flights that day continued, but there was still no solution for my flight. It also turned out that the service desk only opened at 8:00 am instead of 5:00 am. So after waiting for 2 hours, an employee who knew nothing about it finally came. She had no idea about the canceled flights or our missing luggage. We had to fill out the baggage claim online and our suitcases would be sent after 2 to 3 days. It has now been 2.5 weeks and I have not received any responses from Condor. The only thing I get a response to is the baggage claim. They still haven't had time and I have to be patient. I don't even get an answer as to whether my suitcase is even still there. Worthless company. I would warn everyone not to book your flight with Condor. Ik boek nooit meer bij deze vliegmaatschappij. Enkele minuten nadat in mijn koffer had ingecheckt, werd verteld dat alle vluchten verlaat werden door de sneeuwval. Na 5 uur kregen wij te horen dat er geen vluchten meer zouden zijn. Kan gebeuren, dit is overmacht. Meerdere keren heb ik gebeld met Condor, maar elke keer hadden ze geen informatie over vervangende vluchten of andere oplossingen. Ik zou teruggebeld worden of een email ontvangen. Beide is niet gebeurd. Mijn koffer zou ik de volgende ochtend om 05:00 kunnen ophalen. Ook moest ik zelf een hotel regelen, maar door het weer was er geen vervoersmiddel te regelen en zat er niks anders op dan op het vliegveld te slapen. We kregen geen drinken, eten of dekentjes. Het was te koud om te kunnen slapen. De wachtrijen bij de restaurants waren 2 uur om alleen al een bestelling te plaatsen. De volgende ochtend om 05:00 stond ik bij de servicebalie voor de bagage, samen met tientallen andere passagiers. De vluchten die dag gingen door, maar voor mijn vlucht was nog steeds geen oplossing. Ook bleek de servicebalie pas om 08:00 open te gaan in plaats van 05:00. Dus na 2 uur wachten kwam eindelijk een medewerkster die nergens vanaf wist. Ze had geen idee over de geannuleerde vluchten of onze missende bagage. We moesten online de bagageclaim invullen en onze koffers zouden na 2 tot 3 dagen opgestuurd worden. Ondertussen ben ik 2,5 week verder en krijg ik geen reacties van Condor. Het enige waar ik reactie op krijg is de bagageclaim. Ze hebben nog steeds geen tijd gehad en ik moet geduld hebben. Ik krijg niet eens een antwoord of mijn koffer überhaupt nog daar is. Waardeloos bedrijf. Ik zou iedereen waarschuwen om niet bij Condor je vlucht te boeken.

### "flight delay 6 to 7 hours"
Not Verified |  I have my flight from Frankfurt to Seattle, was delayed hours and hours. Every hour they saying just wait we are leaving soon, last 6:30 hours and still waiting for departure 9:38 hours total, flight delay 6 to 7 hours just sitting in plane still the don’t know how long be take. Please don’t take this flight.

### "luggage and its contents are damaged"
It has been almost four months since my trip, and the airline's mishandling resulted in a month-long search for my lost luggage. After three visits to Airport without assistance, I located it at Lufthansa airline's lost and found. Unfortunately, both the luggage and its contents are damaged beyond use. Despite reaching out to various departments via email, I received no response.

### "Terrible experience"
Not Verified |  Terrible experience. Hours of delay. Overbooked flight, they offered upgrade for cash only. Made me downgrade from business to economy because of my pet on board, then offered an upgrade for cash only. regardless. The flight was delayed by hours because of luggage issues, etc which was because of overbooked economy. No blankets, no refreshments, no water, you have to pay for everything and the check in staff is beyond rude.

### "staff were professional, passionate, enthusiastic"
Great airline. The staff were professional, passionate, enthusiastic. They thoroughly love their jobs, and it showed. Seat comfort was good. Amenities were thoughtful and of good quality. Cuisine was remarkably decent. Aircraft was new, clean, and comfortable. What an amazing surprise. This airline really hits it out of the ballpark.

### "All in all disappointing"
Not Verified | Disappointing experience. Brand new plane, flight a bit behind schedule. Seats are very narrow and hard, Condor optimised every inch of the airplane. Food very small and not very tasty, Service okay but not very friendly, bathrooms ridiculously narrow and small. Entertainment so and so. All in all disappointing.

### "we ended up waiting over 7 hours at the airport"
I really wish I read the reviews before buying my flight. I’m a dual citizen and have been flying to Europe since I was born. I have never encountered a worst airline to fly with internationally than Condor. We paid for premium seats and wow I couldn’t believe we had to pay for that. They were worse than any economy seats on other airlines I’ve encountered. Our flight was slightly delayed but we made it to our connecting destination on perfect time. We went through security, got to our gate, just to find out that condor canceled our tickets on our connecting flight because they didn’t think we would make it. Mind you the second flight was delayed and we had over an hour before it left. We ended having to leave the gate, go to customer service, wait for assistance as everyone else flying Condor had various issues as well. In the end we ended up waiting over 7 hours at the airport for the next flight they booked us on. I contacted them over a week ago as I am terrified to fly them on the way back. Almost to the point that I canceled and just bought a new ticket with another airline. They have yet to contact me, I even followed up twice since. Would not recommend condor to anyone flying anywhere.

### "the worst travelling experience"
My flight with Condor/ Marabu (operated by Nordica) was unfortunately cancelled in the last minute. We weren't given any alternative flights in the next hours. Only possibility was the next planned flight the day after at 15.00, which turned out to be at 16.40. We were given only breakfast today, but no vouchers for lunch or anything. First the hotel wanted to force the solo travelers share rooms with other solo travellers, because apparently it was, what Croatian airlines planned. This must be a joke! We were brought the airport around 10.30 and now have to wait till 16.40. I lost one full day because of this. This is the worst travelling experience that I've ever had

### "really poor experience"
I can only say so much, you fly better economy in any other airline than business with Condor. The seats are just the same, legroom is less than in a Ryanair plane. Overall, really poor experience.

### "worst I have ever come across"
For background, we had an outgoing flight from Frankfurt to Jacksonville which was a disaster in and of itself. The return flight 2 days later was also a disaster. Astoundingly poor quality of the aircraft aside, the plane left the gate to taxi to the aircraft, but then turned around due to an engine failure, and was eventually delayed 7 h. The extensive problems over these two experiences can be roughly split into two categories. The worst I have ever come across - Understaffed, inexperienced and unprofessional cabin crew. They had to be reminded to make announcements in German, were conducting themselves very unprofessionally in view of passengers, and generally were not able to manage a tense and stressed passenger pool during the 3 hours that they kept us on the plane while they tried to fix the turbine. Extreme wear and tear of the aircraft. All three planes I have been on were dirty, litter was found around the seats, and the seats themselves were broken in many cases. The replacement plane we were put on had on overwhelming stench of urine throughout the whole cabin, and dust and mildew around the reading lights. I cannot criticise this airline enough. It is without doubt the worst organization, service and experience I have ever witnessed.

### "pay 75€ extra to get my small backpack"
Not Verified |  I couldn’t drop my hand luggage off the desk. I have to take it inside the flight, meaning I had to pay 75€ extra to get my small backpack taking through the boot. Where by you can voluntarily drop off your hand at other airlines.

### "had to pay 150 euro for our 8 kg luggage"
In our ticket, it is written 8 kg could be taken but when you go into the details of this info, they mean actually it has to be hand luggage. We had to pay 150 euro for our 8 kg luggage because they were not hand luggage but they were 8 kg.

### "all they said they can't help"
Flew Condor from Frankfurt to San Francisco on 4th September, the biggest mistake of my life. One out of 3 checked bags didn't arrive. The Condor representative promised me that it would be delivered to my home in 2 days. It's been already 2 weeks and still no luck. The funniest thing is that I have an airtag inside the bag and I can see it's been in San Francisco for a week already. But I don't have any way to get it out of there. I called Condor customer service multiple times, and all they said they can't help. I need to check the status online (which says we have located your bag), and wait. Terrible service, what the point of having customer service which tells you I can't help you?

### "stranded for 24 hours"
Not Verified |  The staff is rude and doesn’t know how to treat the customers. Stranded on the airport for almost 24 hours with food or water. I had to pay from my own pocket for meals. Even after being stranded for 24 hours, company didn’t apologize for the inconvenience. Very shameful for the company and their staff. Never going to fly Condor airlines again and never will recommend anyone this airline.

### "still no luggage or compensation"
Not Verified |  Unfortunately our luggage was lost. We are now back from our vacation of three weeks and still no luggage or compensation for having to buy everything. They have not communicated at all with us.

### "nothing was complimentary"
Not Verified |  This has to be the worst airline I have ever traveled with. They are absolutely horrendous. Our flight was delayed by almost 2 hours with no explanation causing us to miss our connecting flight in Toronto. I contacted the staff to see if they could contact our connecting flight. They refused to do so, I've never been on an airline where the staff are as rude as they were on this one. Apparently it's our fault we didn't book a long enough stop over between destinations even though they were two and a half hours late getting the plane off the ground. But that's completely our fault according to the staff. Not only that if you turn your TV off during the flight it will randomly come on with advertisements even though you've turned it off. Everything on that flight cost something nothing was complimentary.

### "rude discourteous staff"
Not Verified | The check in process was haphazard and inefficient, and not what we have come to expect of a German company. The staff were quite rude and unhelpful. As if they were doing the passengers a big favor by addressing our ticketing issue. Slow service, rude discourteous staff at every turn. I would think three times about flying this airline again.

### “not the best experience”
Not Verified | I was flying with Condor for the first time this Summer and it was a direct flight from Edmonton, AB to Frankfurt. Overall, it was okay..the flight was not late to Frankfurt but it was delayed when I was coming back. Purchased two seats by using Condor Customer service. However, on an airplane map those seats were shown as the ones with more leg room and I paid 300CAD for them which is not cheap. When we were boarding, those seats were all the way in the back, just by the engine, and they were cramped. I think it was a rip off to pay $300 and not even having a little bit of room for legs as it was shown on a map at the time I was purchasing those seats. In fact, some other passengers were also complaining to stewardess about the same problem and I could see that she didn’t know what to say so she came up with some random excuse how there is no extra room. They had some stupid displays hanging from the top and it was saying “Condor” on them so that must be the reason why it seemed to be more leg room, meanwhile it was not. Just some random excuse that she came up with right on spot. Food was also not the greatest, just pasta all the time and it was tasting like garbage. Overall, not the best experience, but it was okay since it’s direct flight to Europe.

### “customer service leaves much to be desired”
This marked my inaugural and final encounter with Condor Airlines for my upcoming journeys. Regrettably, their Apple app falls significantly short when compared to those of other airlines. It lacks the functionality to update or cancel reservations through the app, and their customer service leaves much to be desired. A recent incident exemplifies this: I reached out to cancel a ticket five days before my trip, citing severe illness as the reason. The original cost of the ticket, which included a $75 fee for a checked bag, stood at $435. Unfortunately, their response was a refund of only $160, and I must wait two weeks for the reimbursement. What exacerbates this situation is that they had already debited my account the moment I confirmed the ticket. From this ordeal, I've learned the importance of choosing well-established airlines that provide better support in such circumstances.

### "doesn’t give the option to board early"
I have flown multiple times with Condor from the United States to Germany and back. On my latest flight two out of the flight attendants were rude to me. It was the direct flight from Frankfurt to Anchorage on September 3rd. I asked a flight attendant for help with a window screen and got the reply: “can’t you do this yourself?” Condor doesn’t give the option to board early families with kids. The strollers don’t come out by the airplane door but in the luggage area when you think you gate checked them. It can make you have to walk long ways at the Frankfurt airport with your toddler before you can get your stroller.

### "return flight was a nightmare"
We are a family of 6 who flew with Condor for the first time from Milan to Cancun (stopping in Frankfurt with Lufthansa). We often travel around the world, but this company is for sure the worst ever used. The first flight was cancelled 3 hours before departure without notice or assistance, we were rescheduled for the next day without contacting us, which would compromise our holiday plan (which included hotels already paid). After hours of calls with always different answers we understood that we could have left anyway changing departure airport (Linate instead of Malpensa), but they did not tell us, we had to search and ask ourselves. The return flight was a nightmare: we attempted online check-in 24 hours before departure from Mexico, but it did not work in any channel (laptop, smartphone, app). We called 4 times, over half an hour of intercontinental calls at our expense, to hear that check-in was only physically possible at the airport. We arrived at the desk 4 hours before but it was not enough: plane overbooking, to travel in close seats we would have had to spend about 1000 dollars extra, they checked in all the others passengers and threatened not to let us leave, after which we finally left with all separated seats while having a child and an elderly person in our family. Conclusion: a nightmare, if you want to travel in peace and with a minimum of support, avoid this company

### "fly with another company"
This is one of the least professional companies I have ever used. With a two hours notice, they delayed our flight more than 24 hours! They did not offer any alternative route. Moreover, their assistance phone number was collapsed and it was impossible to reach them. They also offer contact via WhatsApp, which is absolutely ridiculous, since they just reply with an automated message saying they are busy and that the answer will take time (indeed, they never replied). Then, when filing a complaint to claim for a compensation, they send you an email saying that their email inbox is very full and that you should have patience. They even invite you not to contact them again to have updates on the status of your claim. Come on guys, if you are so busy with your email, there are probably two options: your extremely poor service is causing tons of complaints or you do not have enough hired personnel (probably both are true). I would recommend anyone to fly with another company, even if its a bit more expensive. The poor service offered costs a lot of time, which is ultimately more valuable than money (at least for me).

### "absolute worst customer service"
My partner and I recently flew on Condor from Frankfurt to Toronto. This was the absolute worst customer service experience I have ever had. Firstly, Condor staff were extremely rude and dismissive. I had my call button on for an hour, and nobody came to my seat. When I went to the middle area to ask the staff, they shooed me away and sent me to the staff at the back of the plane. When I approached the back, there were three flight attendants laughing and joking around. I told them that I had my call light on for an hour, one of them responded with a smile "Sorry, I forgot" and then went about chatting with his colleagues. Then, they advised that the food I wished to purchase was no longer available. When I asked if they can provide anything complimentary, they said no, to which I responded that "this is the worst airline experience I have ever had" and the flight attendant shrugged his shoulders and simply said sarcastically "sorry!". Secondly, Condor had been completely unhelpful in respect of our connecting flight from Toronto to Vancouver. The Condor flight was over an hour delayed, leaving us with about 1 hour layover before our connecting flight. Understandably, we were concerned. We approached a flight attendant to ask if they could contact Westjet (our connecting airline) to let them know we were going to try to make our connecting flight. They simply said that they will not do that, and that "no airline waits for passengers". I know for a fact that is not true, as I have been on flights where the plane was delayed because it waited for one or two late passengers. I was visibly distressed and the flight attendant rudely told me to "calm down". Then he said it shouldn't be an issue because there would be another flight to Vancouver. Condor refused to offer us, and any other passengers with the same connecting flight, to de-board ahead of other passengers who were not rushed, so that we could make it to our next flight. Once landed, they opened one of two main doors and instructed first class members to de-board first, further delaying us from making it to our next flight. When we left the aircraft none of the staff apologized or said their goodbye comments to us, blatantly ignoring us. In all, we will never fly this airline again, despite us being frequent travelers.

### "Worst company ever used"
Not Verified |  Poor quality airline. Flight was cancelled in New York due to broken part. We received hotel in poor neighbourhood and a voucher that we could not use, because the hotel restaurant was closed. Next say flight was delayed with two hours. Nobody received any information. Upon arrival in Frankfurt luggage was delayed for 3 hours, without information or communication. Worst company ever used.

### "attendants treat guests like cattle"
Not Verified |  I traveled with my 7-months pregnant wife and my two young children. After 9 hours my youngest finally fell asleep and laid his head down in my wife's lap. He was careful not to put the bottom of the shoes on the seat, only the sides. A male flight attendant approached my sleeping wife, woke her up and reprimanded her saying "Fuesse vom Sitz! Sie sind hier nicht zuhause" and then proceeded to repeat the insult in English "Put the feet down! You are not at home here! We paid $7,000 for our flights, about the same as for 10 nights in all 5-star hotels in Frankfurt and 3 other cities in Europe on our trip. It would have never occurred any of the hotel staff to treat us this rude. Condor flight attendants treat guests like cattle. Never ever will I fly Condor again.

### "well below low-cost carriers"
Very disappointing experience for three main reasons. The flight was done by Heston Air, a Lithuanian charter company, which I have experienced in the past. Unhappy staff, very cramped seats and just not a good 'airline'. The flight was delayed, because Condor can no longer pay for a ramp position, and positoning the plane on tarmac just didn't work out. Service is poor, not even a small glass of water is served. All in all, service and comfort are well below low-cost carriers. I will certainly try to avoid Condor in the future.

### "a nightmare and a disgrace"
Not Verified |  I traveled from Canada to Europe to attend a parent funeral. My Condor flight got canceled due to a mechanical failure. That happens. However, everything that happened after was a nightmare and a disgrace. No one from Condor was available at the airport to help me rebook on an urgent basis. I was not able to speak to anyone. Condor staff just went AWOL. I ended up rebooking flights at my own expense using other companies so that I could make it on time to the funeral. When I called Condor after returning home to get a refund, Condor Customer service stone-walled me. They told me it would take 3 months (3 months!) for them to get back to me, and they refused to give me any status on my file. When I became insistent, the operator hung up on me mid sentence, not once, but twice. This means that hanging up on a customer is actually an acceptable policy with Condor Customer service. Do not use this company for any reason, even if they offer the cheapest fare. In case of a problem, they are organized to ensure that you will not see your money back.

### "Very poor service at the check in counter"
Not Verified | 1) Very poor service at the check in counter, 2) They don’t provide a plastic bag to check in your kids car seat. Never seen this with any other airlines before. 3) They lost our luggage, kept us waiting in Frankfurt airport for 4 hours to tell us we can’t find your luggage. 4) To be fair, the flight itself was a pleasant experience but everything else was so painful.

### "movie selection was paltry"
Not Verified | I recently flew Condor roundtrip LAX to Frankfurt. My economy class seat was very uncomfortable. The movie selection was paltry and quite dated. Perhaps the most disappointing feature was the fact that other than the main meal service, Condor charged for snacks. Yes, you had to pay for a bag of nuts or a small bag of crackers. I think that's excessive. I won't be flying this airline again.

### "so careless in communication"
Not Verified | I actually had a good experience on the plane itself but our nightmare began when we landed in Frankfurt. Not only did one bag not make it but both of our bags didn't make to the belt for us to retrieve. Weirdly they told us that it had arrived in Frankfurt but not upstairs. We were going on a nine day cruise and had a few days to get our luggage and when we were told it had been found it was sent to Barcelona. After the cruise we went and picked one of them up but never heard about the other one. So two were delayed and one was lost. But to make matters worse after filing reports trying to get reimbursement for delay and now for the loss we hear nothing and it's been weeks. It's so disheartening to have an airline be so careless in communication and to take care of the luggage and have any sense of responsibility.

### "It is a disgrace"
The day before my scheduled flight from Halifax to Frankfurt I was notified by Lufthansa there would be a change to the second leg of the trip, which I confirmed on line and everything seemed to be fine. I arrived at the airport check in desk 4 ½ hours earlier than my scheduled flight. Because of an irregularity to the change of the second leg of the trip initiated by Lufthansa I was denied boarding on the Condor flight from Halifax to Frankfurt. While on site at the airport I made several calls to all airlines involved, as well as Flight Hub. Lufthansa blamed Air Dolomiti, Air Dolomiti was not reachable, Condor was blaming both other airlines and I was caught in the middle of the 3 of them pointing fingers at one another. Bottom line is the representative of Condor, whose name I have documented, told me flat out they would deny boarding as the company wouldn't take responsibility for the whole trip although they GOT PAID for the whole trip. I was told the only way I would be allowed on the plane was for me to pay for a brand new ticket for my mom and I. As I was going to lose the connecting flight I made another attempt at calling Condor Head office, I dealt with nasty customer service person in Germany who accused me of "not making an effort" to solve the situation. I provided a screenshot of the calls to the various airline companies involved - no use. I was forced to purchase an alternate trip at my own expense. The final response Condor gave Flight Hub's for denying a refund was that I was not entitled to reimbursement due to "no show". I provided copy of the airport parking receipt to expose their lie - no use. It went from the 3 airlines fighting and deflecting responsibility and my elderly mom and I being caught in the middle at the airport, to being accused of not doing enough to solve the issue, to actually being told it was my own fault for not showing up, despite having provided evidence of their lies. In what other industry do you get to keep the customer's money and demand to be paid again for the same trip or you would deny them service and suggest it’s the customer’s fault, ignoring solid proof of the contrary? It is a disgrace and an insult to the intelligence of any rational person.

### "little information at the airport"
I am disappointed with Condor's services. I was flying from Gran Canaria to Munich, the flight was delayed for two hours and I was still waiting for my luggage for 40 minutes. Therefore, I missed my next flight, had to stay in a hotel and buy expensive tickets the next day, and lose one day of work. On their website it is written that delays up to 3 o'clock are not compensated. How great, they were two hours late and it's not their fault, but I was 24 hours late home and lost 500Eur! There was little information at the airport, they didn't even offer any drinks, apparently this is a normal situation for this company. I notice that low-cost airlines like Ryanair or EasyJet are doing much better.

### "Very pleasant experience"
Very pleasant experience! There was a delay for sure, but this is almost normal these days. The temperature in the plane was comfortable, the movies were good (almost 200 movies to choose from), the seat was comfortable and the legroom as in other planes.

### "What a pleasant surprise"
What a pleasant surprise. My first time on Condor but it won't be my last. Smooth check in, orderly boarding, great crew with a very positive attitude and food way above the standard of legacy carriers on the route. Look forward to flying them long haul.

### "the airline is one to avoid"
Not Verified |  I flew on Condor not by choice but because Lufthansa flight from Zurich to Frankfurt left two hours late, so we missed our Lufthansa connection from Frankfurt to Vancouver. Lufthansa rebooked us on Condor flying on the same day. The airplane was nice and seemed new but the airline is one to avoid. They do not offer earphones complimentary, so one must buy them, the meal is small in quantity, not tasty and no there is no choice for economy passengers, but all were given maccaroni with vegetables as they are too cheap to give meat of any kind or fish. In this 9 hours and 50 minutes flight, the miserly meal is given in the beginning of the flight and not until 1.5 hours before landing that they come around with a wrapped piece of bread. By the time the piece of bread arrives, one is famished, as during the flight they do come around with snacks, but one has to buy them. The staff on board seemed really green, wet behind the ears, being mostly young, appearing new to their jobs. However, the worst was the temperature of the airplane. It was really cold, as if we were inside a refrigerator. I asked the flight attendant for a blanket and she said they did not have blankets! I contested that it was impossible. How could a plane with hundreds of people on board not have a blanket? What kind of airline could this be? People were sneezing and coughing and wrapped in coats and their own blankets (I guess they had flown Condor before) so I said I was getting sick from the cold and would review Condor negatively on social media. The flight attendant said she would speak to her colleague to raise the airplane temperature. It got a little bit better and then out of nowhere they gave me a thin blanket. It goes without saying that the temperature went down frigid again. Do they save money by keeping the airplane's temperature uncomfortably low? Also the film selection is sparse and not good. To sum up: I will never fly Condor again and urge all to do the same.

### "wrong and very intimidating"
Apparently, I was flagged for an extra security check when I checked in for my flight at the Barcelona airport. They didn’t do the security check there, however, they waited until later after my initial flight on Lufthansa from Barcelona to Frankfurt, and a 2-3 hour hot and humid race and wait to get through customs and boarding lines. They waited until I was boarding for my long haul flight on Condor (Frankfurt to Seattle) to take me away from my gate, leaving my husband waiting, and search my belongings. To give them credit, they didn’t lay their hands on me, but did search my backpack and carryon. I understand the need for extra security checks and have been so far lucky to avoid them on any of my flights, but to wait until before boarding to do it in a foreign airport with very  police everywhere and to be taken away from my gate and travel partner was just wrong and very intimidating! Then after I was the last to board the airline, Condor had the audacity to blame their delay in departure on a passenger (myself) but still didn’t depart for another 30 minutes! I had always heard good things about Lufthansa which is why I booked with them and Condor, but never again.

### "Business Class below standard"
Business Class below standard despite the new airplane, with Economy seats fitted into business class shells lying flat. Definitely not a business class seat. Very uncomfortable and narrow, not suitable for tall people. Boarding was a mess, keeping us waiting 75 minutes standing without any news about what was happening. The call centre barely speaks English. Strange service with first row of business being more expensive and getting different amenities than other passengers. Kept on promoting paid upgrades until the flight left as if trying to collect money as much as possible. Definitely a low cost business class below standards airline company despite the publicity made around the new aircraft and seats. Would not advise to fly Condor at all even in Business Class in the Airbus A330 Neo.

### "wait 8 days to retrieve our bags"
Our bags were not on our flight to Portland so we filed a delayed baggage claim. There was zero communication from Condor. I tried calling and emailing Condor for help. The email on the baggage claim form got bounced back and is not a working email. On day 8 we got a call from Alaska Airlines saying that our bags were in the lock box in Portland for 7 days. They turned it over to condor on June 7th and Condor did not contact us. On day 8 Michele from Alaska Airlines called us because she was shocked our bags were still there! It appears that Condor does not have a system for dealing with lost bags. We had to wait 8 days to retrieve our bags when we could have had them the next day. This is so unacceptable and caused much hardship. I had medical devices and medication in my bag. I think Condor should take responsibility!

### "Bad customer service"
I have booked a trip to Athens, Greece (Transit through Frankfurt) on Condor airlines. The ticket includes a standard meal on long haul flights, but they don't give an option to select the meal type (Vegetarian). Called to customer service to see if they can help, but they were not able to help and said the only option is to pay $22 to select a upgraded meal. Bad customer service. If you advertise and include standard meals as part of the ticket, it is a basic option to allow the customer to select meal type on the website or through the call center. Very bad customer experience. Similar issue with TSA pre check number. The website advertises that they accept Known Traveler number to go through TSA pre check at the airport, but you cannot update it on the reservation. Tried emailing the customer service and they also said it cannot be updated online or through the call center.

### "expect an apology and a voucher"
My wife's flight was delayed due to crew not showing up on time in addition to many other reasons. She landed late in Seattle and missed connecting flight. Was told by connecting Airline to either get another connecting flight or get a voucher for Hotel through Condor help desk. The girl sitting there at the Condor booth was playing on her phone, when my wife asked to help with getting hotel voucher or moving the flight earlier, and her response was sorry I cannot help you, my supervisor will be here to help you in 30 mins. 30 Mins came and other girls were there also there playing on their phones. My wife came up to ask 2 or 3 other female employees who came to the Condor "HELP" Booth to work on the voucher so that she can get to the hotel with the infant as they have not slept for over 20 hours. All their response was, we cannot do anything, and our supervisor is busy. After over 1 hour, my wife confronted these employees and and pressed on them to call their supervisor. After over 1 hour, supervisor came down and did apologize. I expect an apology and a voucher.

### "Terrible check in process"
Very disappointed! Terrible check in process. Lost my travel stroller. I was travelling with my baby so as always took our travel stroller which supposed to be given me back when leaving the aircraft. Even though there was a label on it saying to be returned they automatically transferred it! It make my trip terrible experience as I needed to transfer myself, my baby and the carry on baggage to the other side of the airport! The personnel rudely said there is nothing to do with it! The stroller is missing! Did not get to the final destination. How disrespectful they are to do this to parents carrying babies?

### "Too many delays!"
Too many delays! The Flight had 2 hours delay and during that this airline didn’t even give us any water or snack! This is so cheap and I don’t recommend this airline! Also they charged me extra $60 just for my carry on.

### "The baggage is lost"
The absence of the service. The baggage is lost, no contact, no information on the web site that does not operate in standard way. Even the report form does not recognise the flight number. So tricky management that no human contact the only machine voice.

### "Boarding process is terrible"
Pros: Cheaper than most other airlines from Seattle to Europe. So, I will give them a couple of 'stars' for that. But if all of the airlines were around the same price, I would never fly this one again. Cons: Website is very difficult to navigate. Finally ended up booking ticket on Expedia, which took 5 minutes as opposed to the amount of time (and frustration) I expended trying to book on the Condor website. Boarding process is terrible in both Seattle and Frankfurt. No priority boarding for B-class. No boarding by groups or rows. No announcements by ground staff. In Frankfurt it looked like they didn't even give priority to people with disabilities and parents with young children. Complete chaos. Staff on board are OK, but most are not particularly friendly. Seat on one leg was beat-up and required constant shoving of bottom of seat to slide under top part of seat to keep bottom from sliding forward. 4.Food is terrible.

### "Mostly a great experience"
Mostly a great experience. Toronto to Frankfurt then Austrian Airlines to Vienna Fare Class: Business (Upgraded to Prime Seat) Nice new A330neo plane. Lovely livery and the plane still smell new. Crew were efficient if not overly friendly. Fluent in English and German. Menu options were good. Cold appetizers were nicer than the hot meals but overall no complaints. Wine selection was good. Great long haul business class hard product. Comfortable pod seats with plenty of space and felt fairly private. I upgraded to Prime Seat and had so much space especially in lie flat position. Able to sleep comfortably. Love the pyjamas provided. Comfy and worth keeping. Boarding was a gong show. No sense of organization or dedicated boarding calls for each group. Just a mass of people trying to board all at once. No priority boarding observed. Overall good experience and certainly cheapest transatlantic business fare I could find. I would not necessarily upgrade to Prime seats again as other seats in business were equally good.

### "told me their planes are outdated"
Booked & paid on Condor Air Website 2 roundtrip Business Class Seats from Los Angeles to Barcelona via Frankfurt. Received following itineraries: LAX to Frankfurt Condor Business, Frankfurt to Barcelona Economy with Lufthansa (their chosen partner). I contacted Condor to complain they advertised full flight as Business but part of received itinerary is Economy. They said they have no control what type of seats their Lufthansa partner assigns & I must take this w/ Lufthansa. Told them I did not choose Lufthansa & did not buy my tickets from Lufthansa but Condor did & they falsely advertised a full Business-Class seat. Condor refused to help. I Contacted Lufthansa & was told Condor only books economy w/ them & I will have to pay additional fee to get Business seats for remaining part of trip. I paid Lufthansa additional $640 for mine & my daughter’s seats. Upon checking in at the LAX Condor counter, I mentioned additional fee I had to pay to upgrade 2nd portion of my flight. I said I had to pay twice for Business seat from Frankfurt to Barcelona (& returning flight). Agent said to file a complaint with Condor to get reimbursed for paying twice for Business seats. I filed a complaint; Condor rejected. My LA to Frankfurt Business seat did not recline, making it less comfortable than Economy seat that reclines to some degree. I had to seat at an upright position. They offered $100 coupon to purchase one of few items offered on their inflight magazine! A Business class ticket costs 3X Economy; my seat was less comfortable than Economy seat. Flight attendant told me their planes are outdated, missing much needed maintenance, Condor won't spend money on making repairs on their old planes. She said they routinely apologize to passengers & are embarrassed by the condition of their planes. On the return flight from Frankfurt to LA on Condor Air the Entertainment monitor on my seat was physically broken & did not operate. Flight attendant apologized & repeated same comments other Condor flight attendant said on previous flight. Once landed at LAX, my checked-in suitcase was delivered badly damaged beyond repair. There was a Condor Air employ at the carousel helping other passenger with damaged suitcases. She assisted me to logon to Condor baggage damage site & showed me how to take numerous photos of every corner and side of suitcase & upload them to their system. Condor employee inspected the suitcase & confirmed the damage; Condor claim system generated a claim #. I was told I will be contacted for assistance, but never did. I filed complaint at Condor website; got rejected. Questionable practice at website complaint process is that to complete the complaint process passengers must include their bank international code, routing number, account number. They do this to intimidate people from submitting complaints as it is impossible to complete their process before sharing this highly sensitive information. I don’t know if this is a legal practice in the US. I understand they may need this information if they choose to reimburse a passenger. But why would they ask for this information before even reading one’s complaint to decide whether to honor the complaint. They read my complaint, rejected each and every one of my grievances, left me with a broken Delsey suitcase, and have my highly sensitive banking information on their record!

### "will NEVER book with Condor again"
Booked tickets Munich to Split with Condor. When we went to check in online, were redirected to Marabu Airlines‘ webpage. Never heard of them, but ok. Online check in doesn‘t work, ok. Got to airport 2 hours before our flight - hundreds of people in the Marabu queue, which is not moving. Everyone looks confused. We talked to other people waiting and it turns out many of them were there for the second day in a row, and had been there hanging out for the whole pervious day waiting to fly before being sent away the evening before. After 5 hours or so, the one check-in staff member made an announcement that all Marabu flights were cancelled and people should return at 9am the next morning for more information. He didn‘t work for either Marabu or Condor so had no further information. Need a hotel? Book it yourself and try to get the money back from the airline was the advice. We go home, return at 9am the following morning. Same scene as the day before. A few hours later, the check in staff tell us all flights are cancelled and there will be no replacement flight. So we had to book our own alternative flight with Lufthansa. Condor customer service say we have to pursue Marabu for a refund - EVEN THOUGH THEY OWN MARABU. We will NEVER book anything with Condor again. If you think this is just a once-off bad experience, have a look at Condor‘s Facebook page. You have been warned! !

### "such disregard and indifference"
Not Verified |  I recently had the misfortune of booking a flight with Condor Airlines, and I must say it was one of the most exasperating and infuriating experiences I have ever had the displeasure of enduring. From start to finish, the airline managed to showcase a shocking level of incompetence, lack of communication, and complete disregard for its passengers' time and well-being. Everything began with our supposed departure time of 5:55 in the morning from Munich to Corfu. Little did we know that this would be the start of a never-ending cycle of delays and frustration. Condor Airlines provided absolutely no information or updates about the status of our flight. We were left stranded at the airport, clueless and abandoned, as the minutes turned into hours. As the delays stretched on, our hopes of a timely departure vanished. It was only a few hours before the initial departure time that Condor Airlines bothered to inform us, in a casual and nonchalant manner, that the flight was rescheduled for a mind-bogglingly inconvenient 21:00. This last-minute notification was a slap in the face to every passenger who had wasted an entire day waiting for a flight that seemed like it would never take off. Throughout this infuriating ordeal, the complete absence of communication from Condor Airlines was truly astonishing. It seemed as though they had no regard for the basic courtesy of keeping their customers informed and updated. The lack of transparency left us feeling helpless and deceived, with no choice but to endure the endless hours of waiting in the airport terminal. The blatant disregard for our time and inconvenience exhibited by Condor Airlines is nothing short of appalling. It is unacceptable for an airline to treat its passengers with such disregard and indifference. I strongly advise anyone considering booking a flight with Condor Airlines to think twice before subjecting themselves to such an abysmal experience. Save yourself the frustration, stress, and wasted time by choosing a more reputable airline that values its passengers and understands the importance of punctuality and clear communication. Condor Airlines, you have failed miserably in providing even the most basic level of service, and I will make sure to share my dreadful experience with everyone I know.

### "Plane fresh and clean"
Not Verified |  Plane is new seats are comfortable and I rode premium economy. I would say the window seat, there is a gap between seat and bulkhead like a bottomless pit do things do fall into it. Condor made clear that upgrades only apply to their airline and not other feeder airline. Plane fresh and clean, service adequate money was $500 less than Delta. The having to get the follow up boarding pass is confusing. I was chosen for "additional screening" along with 4 other male passengers. I thought that was a bit odd.

### "like  a low budget airline"
Former (10 years ago or so) Condor was a sufficient airline with a good service and it was comfortable to fly with. The online check-in and Condor App aren’t working properly. There isn’t any service included in a normal booking. It is necessary to book and pay for every ‘service’ additionally like  a low budget airline. Every of the three flights to different destinations were delayed. The boarding is a chaos, there are in some cases more than 7 boarding groups. I could not recommend to fly with Condor and would look for an alternative the next time.

### "one of the worst flights"
I’m usually not too picky when it comes to flying especially because I hate it in general to begin with. However, it turned out to be one of the worst flights I’ve ever experienced. It was a 12 hour flight from Frankfurt to Los Angeles and it was truly a draining experience. First of all, there was no AC for the middle rows. It was very uncomfortable and impossible to get sleep when it was so hot on the flight. It was also so difficult to communicate with the stewardesses. Anytime I tried to request different things, their responses made me feel very bad for even asking for a cup of water. Me and my friends on this flight had such a hard time even flagging down help because all our touch screens were not working so we could not use it to request someone for help. I’m also shocked that this airline has chosen to charge customers for wine and even headphones on an international flight when I’ve always gotten them as complimentary options at every other airline. Definitely will not be flying condor again nor recommending it to anyone if this is what all of them are like.

### "probably the worst experience"
Never used this airline before and will never use it again. Right from the start on boarding from Las Vegas, there was a huge delay caused by staff ineptness, on baggage checking and boarding order announcements and check in. The departure screen was showing as a departed flight 2hrs after the plane was still boarding passengers on the ground. Total mess. It seemed there was a shortage of flight attendants, as they quickly showed up, just to dump some pasta and a dry brownie to each passenger, then in the morning a bread roll with cheese and I never saw them again. Bottled water was not available even for purchase. The premium economy was taken care for way better by a separate personnel, for much higher ticket cost. This is probably the worst experience I ever had in a overnight flight.

### "Absolutely awful experience"
Not Verified |  Absolutely awful experience. The flight was decent. The food was hospital quality. Condor lost my luggage. When I went to report it, the lady in the window did minimal work to help us get our bags back. A man came out of nowhere and started speaking down to me, waving his hands at me for no reason. We treat people with respect, even if we are upset, the way he postured towards me was both unprofessional and disrespectful. When I asked his name he covered his name tag up and ran into the office. We canceled our return flight with condor and ate the charge rather than go through an awful experience again.

### "Beware - bait and switch and false advertising"
Not Verified |  Beware - bait and switch and false advertising. Horrible experience before the flight. I booked a flight from Los Angels to Florence Italy business class. Online it clearly stated - LAX to JFK, JetBlue, Business Class, Airbus A320. Then JFK business class Condor. I booked it through Condor. After paying for the ticket my confirmation comes back as economy from LAX to JFK. I called "customer service" and was told that I would receive all the same benefits but would not have business class from LAX to JFK (even though I paid for it!). The excuse was they do not control the other carrier! They will (1) advertise the business class flight (2) they will take your money (3) they will try to convince you that you are receiving all the benefits (except your actual business class seat) (4) and when you ask for a refund it takes 7-14 days! False advertising, just a blatant lie. Pay the extra money and fly with a reputable airline!

### "seats we paid for were taken"
We paid premium with Alltours to fly with Condor as it were supposedly to be premium. The only premium we could see was the price. We even paid an additional fee for the XL seats and for the family to be close to each-other. When checked in, we noticed different seats on our tickets but were waived of as "sort it out on the plane" once we boarded, the seats we paid for were taken and we were highly annoyed! There was no legroom 1m89 tall and the table in front of my seat was broken even. We contacted the service desk, every response takes about 2-3 days (which is abysmal!) and we were granted a refund. We then tried to book the seats for the return flight, but the App failed as did the Web version. Customer service responded two days later with "Oh, we can't help, all looks good here. No idea why it does not work", we waited until we could check-in and were able to get seats in one row but all XL seats were of course taken. Upgrading to business was not an option as why would someone upgrade... right? We went the lounge where we enjoyed a drink and some food (Thank you American Express! You know what service is) and waited for the plan to come. It was delayed of course. When boarding started, the chaos started. No logic in order and stewardesses were clueless and rude. At some point, the purser said "we are closing the doors in 30 secs.. we MUST LEAVE NOW! which tells me... screw safety, grab a seat and STFU!.. since that obviously doesn't work when you announce it in German and 50% are not German, we seemed to have missed the slot and a rather annoying voice then announced we would need to wait 50 more minutes for the next slot.

### "Just don't fly Condor"
Not Verified |  First, my ticket was booked by the company I work for through a corporate booking company. As it was booked through my company, you can't use the Condor App, web page, or Condor phone customer service to help you in anyway if you have an issue. Even when the booking company called Condor directly, which Condor said was the only way changes or seat selection could be made, Condor still said no. I booked Premium Economy and then paid $50 on my personal credit card for my seat. The ticket itself was paid for by my company, I had to pay for the seat with my personal credit card. Then, 3 days before the flight, Condor changed planes and the new plane didn't have Premium Economy. Not sold out, but the new plane didn't have those seats at all and no refund for the $50 for my seat selection. My wife was traveling with me, she purchased her ticket directly from Condor, and no seat even though she paid $50 as well. My wife is vegan and selected a vegan meal. But  we are now on the plane in economy, and no vegan meal for her. She is allergic to dairy so her Vegan meal is not a choice, but a medical condition. Her ticket says Vegan meal, when she signs on to the app it says Vegan Meal, but when the Attendant looks at her list, there is no Vegan Meal. The attendant says "it must have been lost because your seat was changed from Premium to Economy". She brings my wife a banana for a 10 hour flight. Economy is the absolute smallest seat I have even flown. We flew on KLM's Cityhopper later on our trip which is an Embraer 190. Tiny plane with only 2 rows on each side. We had more legroom on a commuter plane than on Condor Economy. Inches more. I am 5 ft 11 inches and I have shared a photo of the legroom on Condor. My knees touched the back of the seat in front of me. Condor refunds us the difference between Premium Economy and Economy. But not for the seat selection. So, we are out $100. About the only positive thing I can say is they didn't lose our checked bags. Really low bar. Just don't. Just don't fly Condor.

### "the flight was pleasant"
After reading numerous bad reviews on here regarding Condor, I was a little unsure on how it was going to go - after it was a success I felt I should leave a positive one for anyone looking in the future. I am happy to say the flight was pleasant, the staff were very friendly and attentive during the flight. It looked to be an older aircraft so the seating and space was a little dated, however, everything worked as it should with no issues including the massage seat which was something I hadn't had on other airlines in business. They do have newer aircraft now I just happened to get an older one. Food was very good and well prepared. Drinks selection was plentiful and I enjoyed some really nice wine from a region I am very fond of in Portugal. Smooth flight and arrived as scheduled on time. My only note would be that the seat had something hard hidden underneath it which could be felt, I think it is the mechanism for the electric movement or one of the hinges. Maybe the foam was just a little worn so it was coming through slightly, not hugely noticeable but I did feel it. Overall for the massively discounted price in comparison to other airlines, it was very good.

### "double booked seats"
The flight I had from Frankfurt to Tenerife was horrible. The flight was delayed on the tarmac for almost 35 minutes. They double booked seats and didn’t inform passengers why the plane was delayed.

### "never set foot on a Condor flight again"
We checked in for our business class flight with Condor. There was no lounge available in a small airport, which is fine, but seating was difficult because the terminal was crowded with inadequate facilities. Personally, I would not fly through Düsseldorf airport again. But the unbelievable, shocking con perpetrated by Condor really began when we got on board. We noticed on boarding that there was no difference between the seats in so-called business class and the rest of the aircraft. No dividing curtain, no extra legroom. In fact, there was far less legroom than the extra space seats that Tui sell on their charter flights. The only demarcation was a headrest cover, which stated 'business class' and an empty seat between seat A and C. It did not help that a couple who should've been in row six had occupied our seats in row five, which were immediately in front of the economy section of the aircraft which began in row six. This led to an awkward situation, where the couple who had to move could not understand why we had an empty seat between us. The couple who had to move called the chief stewardess over to explain why we had an empty seat, and they didn't. The whole way through the flight, because there was no dividing curtain, we were subjected to angry stares and unnecessary and deliberate pushing of our seats. It's an incredibly shortsighted policy of Condor to decide not to have any dividing feature between these two cabins. As with each part of the service, the people sitting right behind us were clearly angry that the free drinks and some free food stopped at our row. They made their displeasure clear by constantly pushing our seats and kicking the bottoms. Also, the so-called business class, because there was no curtain divider, was the constant through route for the toilet from economy. Worse than the objectionable passengers behind us was the absolute lack of differentiation between the seat pitch in these expensive seats, compared to those behind. There is not even a recline button on any of the seats, not in business class, nor in economy. Condor seats are fixed at approximately 90° angle and our knees were already touching the seats in front which is clearly why they can't allow anyone to recline their seat by even a couple of degrees. Neither of us are particularly tall. We have never been on a less comfortable or more unpleasant flight in many years of flying in business class. I would never set foot on a Condor flight again in any class and suggest anyone reading takes the same stance.

### "book somewhere else"
I was flying to Frankfurt and had a connection to Geneva. First of all they told us we were delayed 4 hours, then five, then six, then 7 hours. By the time we actually boarded we were then waiting another hour on the aircraft. All they offered were food vouchers for 20 bucks per person but no places in the airport would accept it. At this point I'm exhausted and annoyed. Of course I missed my connecting flight. Upon landing in Frankfurt the staff on the plane was absolutely useless and told us just to find a condor desk to re-book. I end up asking everyone where the desk is, until I realize there isn't even one open. Thank god some random woman told me to run to the gate and they will rebook it for me then. I run to the gate just in time and they reassure me that my luggage made it on to the connecting plane. Of course it did not. I land in Geneva and have to fill a luggage sheet. After all this I filed a complain and they emailed me saying I can get compensated 804 Canadian due to the extreme delay. This was back in November. I have not gotten anything at all. So now it is April and I call them and am stuck on the phone on hold for 20 min. I am pretty sure he just put me on hold hoping I would just hang up. Finally tells me I have to call back during German business hours. Absolutely ridiculous save yourself the headache and book somewhere else!

### "Hands off, absolutely ridiculous"
Absolute joke! Paid seats booked in Business and Premium Economy - they have already downgraded my husband at the check-in - while entering the plane (at the check-in I had still got my booked business boarding pass) they suddenly gave me a new ticket with seat number in economy. Short reason: Sorry, aircraft change. Flight duration is 7 hours and that was also the reason why I booked a higher class. Hands off, absolutely ridiculous. A great way to alienate customers who are willing to pay a higher price.

### "delayed in JFK for 1 hour"
I bought a flight from New York to Warsaw with 1.5 hours connection to LOT Polish in Frankfurt. The flight was delayed in JFK for 1 hour, immediately on arrival I received a text that my connecting flight was rebooked, even though I still had 30 minutes to board the plane. I had to leave transit zone and go through the whole check-in process again. I have an impression that this airline sells tickets with short layoffs so that the total duration of the flight looks great. However you would never make it on time and end up spending way more time traveling. Also, food is horrible: pasta, bread, sandwiches.

### "definitely wouldn’t recommend Condor"
Staff was friendly and helpful on check-in, but all my impression was spoilt when I found my dog in Toronto being not in his native box. We arrived in Frankfurt airport with our own box, which we use day-to-day for travelling and for resting at home. It was our property and a box, which my dog got used to. The staff checked this box entirely, approved its condition, we closed the door and they took a dog. What was my surprise to see MY dog in a strange x2 bigger box. I didn’t expect this, nobody knew where actually my box is in Toronto airport, they said the changing was made in Frankfurt. I really think it’s an extra stress for an animal to be put into other box by strangers at some point of boarding to the plane. Also there was one more owner and a dog with the same situation. So it’s a common thing with Condor? It’s shocking! I definitely wouldn’t recommend Condor to anybody.

### "most unfriendly business class"
Not Verified |  Unfriendly and indifferent attitude of the flight crew from Frankfurt to San Francisco in August 2022. The service provided is the worst. I was 5 months pregnant on the flight with my 2 children and husband. The flight attendants serving business class were not happy, it was obvious that they were very annoyed by passengers with children, although children behaved quietly and did not disturb anyone. But the worst thing was that we were last served and there was no food (main courses) that children can eat (which is not spicy) there were 3 main courses, of which 2 ended before us and we had no choice what to eat. This is the worst and most unfriendly business class I have ever encountered

### "sold us something and never delivered"
We purchased business class tickets about a month previous only to be downgraded at check in. They said we could still use the business class lounge and would be served business class meals on the flight. None of that happened and because we were downgraded at check in we had no option to take another flight or use a different airlines as we had connecting flights to get us to Whitehorse, Yukon. All and all Condor sold us something and never delivered.

### "never had less comfort on a flight"
Made the mistake thinking that Condor was a sister airline of Lufthansa and thus a good airline. Never again will I fly with them, or at least not long distance. Our flight from Frankfurt to Cape Town was 12 hours, and never before have a had less comfort on a flight. I am 1,78cm tall and could not sit normally as my knees were stuck between the seats. They have cut every corner to make it a budget airline even though their prices are very high. Their economy premium is what other airlines have as normal economy. No food options you get what there is, which has no taste (ok airline food is usually not great but this was bad). Soft drinks are free, other drinks you need to pay for. Lights out at 0:30 so no sleep before that. And around 12 they hold a commercial on every screen for duty free shopping, very annoying. Still have to fly back with them unfortunately. Never book this airline, unless you have absolutely no other choice or can go for the premium option.

### "4 hour delay and chain of mishaps"
JFK-FRA - Business operated by Smart Lynx Check in was ok and used the lounge in Terminal 1. Plane arrived 15 min late from FRA and had a bus position. I went to gate 11 when boarding suppose to start. Gate 11 area was crowded to an extent where people were not able to move. The area got hot and everybody try to vent. The ground crew arrived from check in and were lounging/hiding behind the Gate counter. Nobody cared. No announcement - nothing. Numerous people asked at gate, what is going on? We did find out the crew is arriving late. The crew arrived late and waited 45 min behind Gate 11 counter for the bus to take them to the A330. Why? The situation at the gate was unbearable and people got angry and upset. Nobody cared - no (and I meant to say zero nada zip) announcement made...Why? Now the delay of 15 min had grown to 2 hours. Finally we (Group 1) got on the bus to the airplane, but the bus stopped at the plane and we waited...10 minutes...20 minutes...30 minutes...the packed bus got hot and people were screaming, 'what is going on'. No answer. Nobody cared. Passengers knocking on the bus windows to signal but not even the ramp agent or any other cared or responded. The bus driver yelled, he does not know. After 40 minutes we got off the bus and did board the plane to wait another 45 minutes. The blame was its all JFK fault. The water did not arrive and and and but even with all that not a single Condor ground crew member did anything to ease the situation...they did not care. The cabin crew had to take all the heat and questions for the now almost 4 hour delay and chain of mishaps but they did a good job.

### "Those who consider traveling it should beware"
Not Verified |  My wife travelled this airline from Johannesburg, South Africa on 14 January and had a really terrible experience. Departure was delayed by 2 hours. Connecting flight information at Frankfurt was ambiguous which meant she was not even sure of when her next flight will be or where it will be boarding. She was also served breakfast that did not meet her dietary requirements. I also was quite concerned for her safety and wellbeing. I think that this airline should not be operating. Those who consider traveling it should beware.

### "Customer service is awful"
I've tried flying this airline twice in business class. Both times have been chaos. Save yourself some grief, pay the extra money and fly a better airline. Pros: Airplane cabin staff were helpful and attentive. Flights to Europe are lower in cost. Cons: Customer service is awful. I'll comment on our first experience which after 4 months our case is still unresolved. Our flight was scheduled to take off at 7pm Aug. 26 from Portland Oregon to Frankfurt Germany. We had a hotel scheduled for the night of arrival, and a connecting flight to Stockholm scheduled for the next day. On Aug. 26, at 10:37am we received an alert that our flight was delayed to the next day (24 hours). We immediately had to change our airport transportation, 1 connecting flight and 2 hotel reservations. We had to pay a 50% fee to reschedule the connecting flight. Almost 47 minutes later we received a "corrected alert" that our flight was delayed NOT to the next day! It was delayed 1hr 25min on the same day Aug. 26 (in reality, we weren't able to board the plane for more than two hours). After the corrected alert we could not get airport transportation, our original connecting flight was full so we had to purchase new connecting flight tickets at the premium price, and re-book both hotels. The additional cost to us was over $ 5,813. I regularly followup with Condor Airlines about the status of our claim. Their response continues to ask for patience due to "high volume of incoming mail". The delay was not due to weather, and the counter and gate staff could offer no explanation. We tried inquiring to file a claim for a partial refund, but were told to contact Condor customer service, which is a black hole of no response.

### "never seen a more disorganized airline"
I fly business at least twice per month for work. I have never seen a more disorganized airline in my life, flight from Frankfurt to JFK on December 5th. Forget about the flight that had ZERO basic amenities for business class, no working TV’s, no headphones avail to even use your phone, two different flight attendant crews who were confused on their own task and not enough food to chose the meal you want on the menu they provide. Once we landed they didn’t have their act together either and the ground crew was completely clueless in JFK so much that a Condor executive was on board and had to call the ground crew to help them while he was in the plane with us trying to deplane! Finally they lost my luggage which showed up 10 days later to my house! With PROMISES of reimbursing us for clothes and necessities I needed to buy on my trip because no luggage! Try filing a claim it’s been almost exactly one month that I filed a claim for reimbursement and they do not respond! I paid $1600 for a one way and incurred $450 in extra fees that they promise to cover!

### "service on board is disappointing"
The cabin crew was generally not very friendly, and some of them were unprofessional. When boarding the aircraft, instead of greeting the passengers and helping out with storing luggage, two of the crew members in the economy were engaged in personal discussions, not even acknowledging passengers. During the landing, they did not notice that some passengers did not have seats in the mandated upright position. The food quality is average, and you have no choice in terms of the meals you get. Also, they don't provide enough drinks, and you need to constantly go to the back and ask for more. They don't provide bottles of water, only small cups. Economy seats have very limited legroom and are not very comfortable. On the one hand, you get slightly lower prices than Lufthansa and have the advantage of flying directly; on the other hand, the service on board is disappointing. The flight was almost on time, but they run a tight schedule and delays are not unusual.

### "worst flight experience ever"
Not Verified |  14 December 2022 Frankfurt - Male 20.20, departed 22.50! This was my worst flight experience ever. Because of the mistake of the staff some travellers were guided to the wrong gate, We have waited very long time till everyone was on board and the baggage was loaded in to the plane. The IFE screen at the plane looked like 1980 year television. In total we were 2 hours late on the destination and in total 23 travellers were late for there transit flight so everyone needed to arrange visa and hotel to stay. The staff was so arrrogant and did not care about anything.

### "Never again will I fly with this company"
This was my worst long haul flight ever. I booked Condor with the belief it was still Lufthansa owned and Star Alliance member hence a quality European airline. The aircraft we encountered was an old phased out Etihad plane that Condor had leased. tacky decor and worst of all we had 12 hours flight with no entertainment system as the system was down. About 4 hours into our flight the electricity of the plane completely shut down leaving everyone scared about the state of health of the plane we were sitting in. Not very reassuring indeed and we were hoping the cockpit instruments at least were working fine. The food was mediocre, Penne Arabiata no choice for main course and beer or wine costed 7 EUR each. A worst budget airline long haul flight was the end result - Never again will I fly with this company.

### "5 hours delayed waiting inside the plane"
Not Verified | This is the worst airlines my flight is from Toronto to Frankfurt. It’s 5 hours delayed we are still waiting inside the plane to fly. I will never fly with Condor again.

### "don't let you travel with hand luggage for free."
This the worst airline ever. They don't care about passengers at all, flights delayed so much and you are not given right information. They don't let you travel with hand luggage for free. Please do not book with them, otherwise you will regret

### "I will never book them again"
Not Verified |  When I had to exchange my ticket for later date and my new ticket was $250 cheaper, Condor did not give me a credit or refund for airfare. They kept that amount and they still charged me $160 exchange fee. I had to exchange my ticket twice due to family issue and the 1st time they charged me $130 but the 2nd time $160. So, what's their exchange fee really? They do not have a set policy on fees and other things. Then their customer service rep booked my new ticket for 1 week earlier. It was his mistake. He was careless and didn't care about the customer. Overall, I ended up canceling their ticket, they kept the ticket price amount. I will never book them again.

### "they are ripping off customers to try to stay in business"
Not Verified |  Condor has changed the carrier at the last minute (they always do they are now basically a ticket reseller for cheap airlines) by using the cheap airline carrier SmartLynx for an intercontinental flight. We paid our Premium Economy ticket over Eur 800 one way and after they subcontracted the flight to SmartLynx they were selling economy tickets at 400 Eur. Needless to say that Premium Economy was not available with SmartLynx and we were ripped off by Eur 400 x 2 persons. No refund from Condor whatsoever. This airline is on the brink of insolvency and they are ripping off customers to try to stay in business. Do not book with them they are doing this as standard procedure. Needless to say that the Smartlynx cheap carrier was the worst intercontinental flight of my whole life. Letting fly a cheap European carrier an intercontinental flight is plain criminal. Think about flying Ryanair from Dominican Rep to Europe. Stay million miles away from Condor.

### "Condor is truly terrible"
Not Verified |  Condor is truly terrible. I've read reviews before booking and still decided to give them a chance and I wish I didn't. Their customer service is awful and their only answer is "there is nothing we can do". They do not offer refunds or airline credits (no matter the reason) and they say if you have a problem with anything just leave a complaint. Please save your money and sanity by booking with someone else.

### "We will not fly with them again"
I'm writing this review on behalf of my daughters who actually flew with Condor. The flight from Frankfurt to Minneapolis was delayed at departure so they missed a connecting flight to Seattle. We had to book them in the hotel overnight and purchase new tickets for the next day. When we asked Condor for the refund they told us to file an online claim and attach all receipts for their review. It has been over two months since then and we heard nothing back from the airline. When trying to contact them online we get only automated messages saying not to file any claims again. Getting through by phone is next to impossible. Be careful when booking with them. It's cheap but there is a reason for that. We will not fly with them again.

### "I would be better off in cargo"
Not Verified | I've flown Condor long haul twice a year for 15 years. Premium economy has always been a good value compared to other airlines. However, I know that all airlines are still hurting after the COVID pandemic and with my next trip in about a month I've had the most terrible time ever with any airline getting a really basic and simple booking revision completed. Total time on the phone was around 6 hours over a three day period. If you can get them to answer a phone you are fortunate, and if you can understand their English your hearing is much better than mine. In spite of the language being very difficult to understand, during three of my six calls, I've concluded that those three that I'd spoke with just did not know what they were doing. This goes for a lot of their ground crew on their seasonal routes I suppose because they are part time and being trained in a short period. In one instance the counter person attached my bag claim sticker to my luggage, I pointed it out and he apologized. It's obvious they need to sharpen their skills. The only thing I can say is that they got me to where I was going, and was fed well. As far as comfort? I would be better off in cargo. But no denying they are the cheapest. I don't want to run an airline, but would suggest they increase their fares by 20-25% and provide less seating with more space. They would still be about 15% less than most of their competition.

### "most uncomfortable I've flown"
Economy was among the most uncomfortable I've flown in years. I'm only 5'8 and there was barely enough legroom. The temperature of the plane felt like 80 degrees for 11 hours. The first meal was plain vegetable pasta and then the second was some sort of cheese sandwich with no alternative options. They barely had enough ice if you wanted a cold drink! When my mates and I wanted to order beers outside of the servicing period, we were instructed to go to the back of the plane to ask (and pay) for it there. Lastly, there were only two movies for in flight entertainment. This is the kind of flight you want to bring your own meal and snacks on, with your own entertainment setup. I won't be flying them again.

### "the most uncomfortable flight"
Not Verified |  Airline makes a ton of lazy mistakes that you end up paying for down the line. Check in was not accurate- booked my spouse and I different seats even though we booked together. Flight was delayed by 40 minutes. Extremely warm on the flight- small seats and cramped. Flight home was the same story. Staff also did nothing to stop kids kicking my seat the entire flight of 10 hours. I asked the parents to stop their kids and they let them keep doing it. Was the most uncomfortable flight for that duration I’ve had in recent years. Will not fly them again.

### "crew treated us like children"
Seeking non-stop, over-the-pole flights, we flew economy on our outbound flight to Frankfurt and business on our return to Anchorage. The check-in to boarding process required roughly 2.5 hours before both flights because online check=in did not work, the check-in counters are difficult to find, have long lines, and are located in separate terminals from the departure gates, requiring multiple escalators/elevators and, in Frankfurt, a bus ride to access the plane from the tarmac. After passing through security at the Anchorage airport no services are available so you will not be able to buy even a bottle of water to bring on board. Overall, both flights added roughly 6 hours to the round trip when compared to the multi-change flights we have taken on other carriers in the past. Economy class seat are extremely tight; an adult over 5.5 feet cannot bend over the access anything placed on the floor in front of your seat. The crew treated us like children, directing us to keep the window blinds closed after takeoff and to sit down if we stood by our seat. Window seat assignments, on-board entertainment (using your own headphones), and edible food cost extra (totaling an additional $122 per passenger). Business class is more civilized, providing comfortable seats that recline fully, noise cancelling headphones, decent food, a bag of amenities, and free entertainment (although the choices are the same as in economy). The crew was efficient and pleasant although they hurried us through food service. Both our outbound and inbound flights had very warm and dry air with no individual seat adjustments that worked. While masks were required on both flights, lots of people were coughing and sneezing regularly throughout both flights.

### "worst experience of my life"
Was not allowed to board the plane after my seat that I paid for was given away to a standby customer. 9 other passengers in our flight, all paid seat selected customers also were not allowed to board. Never once did anyone from Condor apologize. Waited 5 hours before they finally gave us a hotel for the night. Missed the first 2 days of my Italian vacation finding a new way to get there. The worst experience of my life. Contact centre was awful. No help, no accountability. Still nobody from Condor has contacted us to say why this happened, offer to pay for non refundable rooms or even say sorry.

### "lied to about the seating"
We booked a pair of business class seats for my wife and myself roughly nine months prior, and checked in online several hours before the flight. Once at the airport (FRA) we proceeded to the check in counter where they took our luggage. After it disappeared down the belt, we were told to talk to another agent. Due to a sudden aircraft change the flight had no business class seating, and consisted of economy only. However, we would be given a row (3 pax) each. This is regrettable but normal. However, on asking to cancel our tickets, we were told we would not receive any refund and would not be rebooked - they also have our luggage at this point. Not wanting to miss our next connection, we decided to move forward and board the aircraft. We immediately noticed the 12 business class seats that did indeed exist. Even further, no seats were blocked (the 3 pax did not exist). This was standard economy seating. We asked a flight attendant what was going on. We were obviously shocked. Surrounded by an entire cabin of passengers being lied to about the seating, it turn bad quickly. The gate pulled away and we were trapped on the aircraft. For the next two hours we sat, unable to exit with no explanation. The cabin began heckling the crew as they continued to lie about the departure time without rationale. Finally we saw the issue, they were waiting for cargo to arrive and load. Clearly the passengers were the second priority. Once in the air a woman started projectile vomiting. Instead of helping the poor girl, the flight attendants ran around screaming. After about 15 minutes I was about to get up and help this poor girl to the bathroom when one of the other flight attendants finally intervened and did so. We finally talked to yet another flight attendant about this whole situation. She said "what can I do about it? and that asking her to do so was cruel. Upon landing, to no surprise at this point, we sat another hour on the tarmac. An elderly gentleman sitting behind us asked repeatedly asked for wheelchair because he could barely walk. He was ensured over and over he would have one. As we climbed down the stairway, I helped carry his bag and across the tarmac to the busses. No chair in sight. Everyone still in shock. And left stranded, having missed our connection by hours.

### "Claustrophobic business cabin"
Claustrophobic business cabin, with one bathroom, seats become beds only apparently for someone 5 feet 11 perhaps, awful, limited options food, no business lounge in LAX, no internet on board. Limited movie collection. A serious ripoff. Think before clicking.

### "Never had such a bad experience"
Not Verified |  Horrible flight, first time I've ever flown trans-Atlantic when they charged for movies and TV, and choices were slim and bad. They were two hours late on both legs of the flight and lost my luggage. Never had such a bad experience before.

### "worst airline I have ever flown"
The worst airline I have ever flown. I flew into Frankfurt in June and now it is August and I went 6 weeks without my luggage because they lost it. Their customer service reps do not anything. I never received my luggage and they do not answer and I am unable to get claim my lost baggage because they do not send a letter or determination stating they lost my bag. I cannot even claim anything through my insurance since they have horrible customer service. Also the plane looks like it’s from the 70’s, nothing worked. It was a 12 hour flight and we were also delayed three hours.

### "If at all possible avoid them"
Not Verified |  I could barely fit in my seat and the customer service was absolutely terrible. Very complicated to figure out how to get where. There was a pot of confusion at the gate. There was nothing pleasurable about flying with them. If at all possible avoid them unless you are truly stuck somewhere.

### "very pleasant flight"
Not Verified | Vancouver to Frankfurt. Thank you Lufthansa and Condor for very pleasant flight from YVR to PRG and back. Speaking for myself and my 7 year old that we will never hesitate to travel with you again. Very appreciate no messing over "mandates" and being very tolerant .

### "I'd be tempted to fly Condor again"
This was my first time flying Condor. I only bought this ticket because I needed a last minute ticket from Paris to the US and Condor’s Frankfurt to Boston route proved the most reasonably priced option. I saved about $800 for being willing to try Condor over the next most affordable other options. I was actually a little scared to try Condor (actually couldn’t bring myself to try two cheaper options I’ve here left out of my calculations). But I’m glad I did try! The flight got uncomfortable by the 7th hr — my seat in 37A was too cramped. But for the first 6 hrs, I was really okay. The meal was good enough, I didn’t have high expectations, given the terrible reviews. But my pasta dinner and then pizza pocket snack both were good enough to eat. The pasta dinner featured some very tasty potato salad! The crew seemed reasonably professional. I'd be tempted to fly Condor again, but this time I would choose the business class Seats.

### "One of the worst airlines"
One of the worst airlines I have ever flown with. Online check-in was not working for some reason, it didn't accept my covid vaccine, even though I tried with 3 different documents, all of them being valid and accepted later in-person. This meant that I can't have my boarding pass, so I had to wait 1 hour in line to do an in-person check in. There I found out that since I have an economy light ticket I cannot have a carry-on luggage, only a personal item. This is quite outrageous on a transatlantic flight, but the worst thing was that this was not clearly highlighted in the confirmation email (it only said that I don't have any checked-in baggage but it didn't say anything about carry-on). Therefore, I had to pay 50 euros for my carry-on luggage, but the real issue was with the communication and tone of the check-in lady. She was quite agitated and not kind by any means. The most ridiculous thing is the 9 euro in-flight premium entertainment package. My return ticket was $1100, therefore 9 euros are practically nothing compared to this. If the ticket would have been $1120, I would have still bought it, but at least I would have had a decent experience. This form of ridiculous penny pinching leads to no-one using the screens in the back of the seats, so it's totally unnecessary to have them. Food was low quality and not enough in quantity. Seat comfort was terrible, I am quite an average sized human but could barely fit in the seat and it was very far away from comfortable, especially for a 11 hour flight.

### "customer service was pathetically bad"
Everything written above about Condor is true. The plane was old, the food service was so small that it was mostly laughable. The customer service over the phone was pathetically bad. Check-in was not successful online, there was a risk that it should have been done during the 2-hour changeover at the Frankfurt airport! Never again. And it wasn't even cheap, for the same price you can get decent things from Air France or Lufthansa.

### "worst company I have ever flown"
I can assure this is the worst company I have ever flown and a 4/10 score is generous for Condor. They don't care about Customer Service as I was actually told by one of the agents. I had so many calls with them (to solve multiple issues) and every time the agents were rude and unhelpful. One time the agent answered with "hello" and I had to ask if that was Condor - his answer "of course it is". Pathetic. The lack of service is reflected on all levels of the company, from gate agent who yawns and ignores you, to missed luggage agents who do not know the protocol for handling lost luggage. On top of the booking issues, the airline lost my luggage. That is not uncommon in the current climate, however, they have no process that is reliable to find your luggage. One agent told me that luggage is not always supposed to arrive on the same flight, so my expectation was unreasonable. It was new to me. I still have no idea of the location of my bag, I am told they can't trace it even though they have coded tags. The planes are old and extremely dirty. The lavatories are gross. On my way to Europe, the inflight system was not functional, but they neglected to tell passengers. So there was no seat power, no entertainment, nothing for 10 hours. Most of us did not have enough phone battery to last the flight either. The seats still have ethernet cable connections, which gives us an idea of how old the planes are. To be fair, the only saving grace of this airline is the flight crew. They do their best in very poor conditions. The carts are ancient and make it very hard for them to serve food and clean up but they do so with a smile on their faces. I felt for them, and was very appreciative.

### "such a disrespect"
Not Verified | Toronto to Bucharest via Frankfurt. The worst traveling experience in my 40 years on this earth. This company should be put out of business together with Lufthansa. After delaying my flight by 2 hours and missing my connection flight, Condor made me wait in the airport for 9 hours, during that time begging to talk to your representative to book me a room in a cheap hotel making me pay for my cab and many many more outrageous mistakes when all of this was Condor's doing. Traveling for 3 days because of Condor! Shameful and disgusting! They had the nerve to send me an email after this nightmare urging me to give you my money again for future vacations - such a disrespect!

### "customer service has been awful"
Not Verified |  My family was booked on a flight from Portland, Oregon to Frankfurt Germany with a connection to Paris. The flight was delayed by four hours in Portland and we missed our connecting flight to Paris. On the flight my daughter became air sick. I took her to the closest bathroom on the back of the plane to get a vomit bag and hopefully get her to the bathroom in time. I asked the flight attendant for a sick bag, she would not hand me one and pushed my daughter away from the bathroom. She would not allow us to get to the open bathroom on the other side of the plane. My daughter then vomited on the floor. The flight attendant yelled at me and at my daughter get her out of here, threw a towel on the floor and said "Now you have to clean that up. and made me clean up the vomit. I was not offered anything to clean my hands or any apology. I have never had treatment like that. I was trying to get my daughter a sick bag or to the nearest bathroom and was blocked. It was very upsetting. The attendant did not offer any help, any bags, or anything to clean my hands. How can this be explained? After this experience we were stranded in Frankfurt with no connections and no communication. We were told that we would be rebooked on new flights to Paris during our flight. That did not happen. There was zero information given to us on how to connect to our flight to Paris when we arrived in Frankfurt. There was NO information given to us, no email and no phone call. In Frankfurt a Condor employee said that they re-booked us to get to Paris leaving at 12;30pm on 6/14. I called Condor and confirmed those flights on 6/13/22. When we arrived at the airport we were told that Condor had not booked us on that flight properly and we no longer would have a flight to Paris until the late afternoon. I have spent several hours on the phone with Condor trying to figure this out, no one helped me and I was disconnected several times. Because of this delay we have missed several days of our trip, lost hundreds of dollars on the vacation rental. Since being home the customer service has been awful. No help, no emails returned. I finally took to their social media did I get a lackluster response.

### "served two horrible, disgusting meals"
Awful. Impossible to check in online after many, many attempts. Had a 4 hour layover and didn't end getting a customer service rep to issue our boarding passes until just before the flight - nerve wracking as hell. Once on board, we were served two horrible, disgusting meals. We were told we were going to have premium entertainment, only to find out none of the screens, wifi or charging outlets for phones were working - for a 10 hour flight! Seat wouldn't recline and lock, so I either sat straight up for 10 hours or rocked back and forth. The only thing good about this flight was we landed safely and our flight was smooth - kudos to the pilot!

### "Horrible Customer Service"
Not Verified |  Horrible Customer Service. It has been 5 days since Condor lost our bags. We spent 2 hours at BWI being told continuously that the bags were coming and then we found out they were not able to be located. I completed a form at BWI. I was subsequently told by Condor without a specific reference number that I was not provided they were unable to locate or help me find my baggage. They were unable to accept any customer service complaints. I have filed numerous forms with the company and have not been contacted as yet. I have been hung up multiple times by their customer service representatives. They are uncaring and unhelpful at customer service. While on board the seats were cramped and unable to recline properly. You had to pay for any significant premium entertainment €9 for old movies. I will never fly this airline again.

### "baggage has still not been located"
Traveled for a family camping trip and Condor lost our luggage with 3000€ worth of backpacking gear. No one wanted to assist or provide any information or compensation for our hardship of missing the first 5 days of our trip. Our baggage has still not been located.

### "inflight staff are the shining light"
Not Verified |  Overall an OK experience. The outbound flight was delayed by 3+ hours due to an instrument light that needed a physical sign-off by a technician that was 2+ hours away. If this was an isolated event, that would be one thing, but reading numerous reviews before booking my flight it sounds like this happens quite frequently. Shame on me, I guess. The Condor 767's are rather old, from my understanding (28 years on average) so it seems like this problem could be better planned for. This delay caused me to miss my connecting flight with Lufthansa, which was a whole other ordeal in and of itself. The return flight was uneventful, thankfully. The only issue was that my digital boarding pass listed an incorrect seat (I specifically paid for an aisle seat with premium entertainment) so that caused me to feel pretty anxious. When I got to the gate in Frankfurt I asked the desk agent about my digital pass, only to have him largely ignore me. He then printed a new boarding pass that had my correct seat. What this was about, I don't know. The cabins aren't bad, seats are ok and the inflight staff are the shining light for this airline. They were polite and attentive and I appreciated their help.

### "Never travelled in such poor conditions and frustration"
Awful. Impossible to check in online. 20 min minimum to get customer service on the line. Chat only available weekdays during regular working hours. Flight was 2 hours late on departure. Only 2 movies were free. You need to pay to have access to the rest. Condor rescheduled my second flight thinking I would not make it due to the 2 hours delay - without any notice. I run to get to flight 2, only to learn that my seat has been cancelled and moved to the next flight which is 4 hours later. Lufthansa calls Condor to ask for the ticket to be reinstated so I can take the flight as I was supposed to, Condor refuses - without any explanation. Waste of time and money. Never travelled in such poor conditions and frustration.

### "What a horrible experience"
What a horrible experience. 3 hours late leaving Boston with no communication. Cramped and unpleasant plane with no screens. Bus shuttle in to gate delayed us a further half hour. Then of course missed connecting flight. No customer service in terminal. They automatically rebooked us on a flight ten hours later though there was an earlier one they had promised. No customer support. Lufthansa no help because “you booked with Condor”. Stay away.

### "we received no support whatsoever"
The flight was delayed by 13 hours, and we received no support whatsoever. No hotel accommodation for the night, no food, nor beverage, nor voucher to use at the airport. All passengers were frustrated and we were constantly receiving intentionally deceiving information by the staff.

### "Will not be flying with them again"
Horrible. They lost my bag, I went to a front desk person and they basically told me it wasn’t their problem and to file a claim online. Trying to locate my bag was so stressful, customer service could not update me on my bag status and continuously transferred me to the wrong people or they were not answering. I still have no idea what happened to my bag. Will not be flying with them again.

### "abysmal experience"
Calgary to Berlin. Absolutely horrible experience with Condor. We booked a flight with connecting flights through Condor. They sent us an email letting us know what the requirements were for our flight, but upon arrival at the airport, we were denied boarding for not having a negative covid test and just our vaccine records. This was a connecting airline, however because it was purchased through Condor we should have been provided with the necessary information for our flight. Which we were not. When we called Condor’s customer service line, we were met with a very rude and cold representative that was unwilling to help us or even give us additional information so we could assess our options. They also said we would not be able to catch a different flight in order to make it to our connecting condor flight because the boarding pass would then be incorrect and therefore we would have to forfeit our entire departing ticket price. (Over $700 per person). The absolute lack of customer service was surprising and so frustrating. And the unwillingness to help or provide information was also incredibly disappointing. An absolutely abysmal experience. Would not recommend this airline to anyone whatsoever and will not be flying with them in the future. I have nothing positive to say.

### "crisis management was a disaster"
A landing in Seattle was not possible due to weather conditions. The flight was diverted to Vancouver. The passengers were then all accommodated overnight in hotels. The crisis management for the onward flight was a disaster. We were initially told that we would receive an email with information, which did not happen. Instead, we were told in the hotel that we should all fly back to Seattle the next afternoon at 16:30. Since many of us had booked connecting flights, it was not at all clear whether we could travel onward from Seattle on the same day, especially since the plane was not scheduled to arrive until shortly before 6 pm. There was zero information and the Condor phone hotlines in Germany and USA said they were not responsible. At the airport, there was no Condor information booth and the airport information desks had not received any information from Condor. One heard everywhere only "Yes, this Frankfurt flight. There are quite a few people asking, but we don't know anything. All passengers lost at least one whole travel day and those who did not get a connection in the evening even two. It was a disaster and all very nerve-wracking. You certainly don't need that a second time!

### "unacceptable handling of the matter"
The flight was booked for my father, a Ukrainian refugee, fleeing the horrific reality of what is going on in Southern Ukraine. He was denied access to the flight because Condor  wrongfully told him that he has to be vaccinated / have a negative covid 19 test to enter the country. According to AMENDED NATIONAL INTEREST EXCEPTION FROM PRESIDENTIAL PROCLAMATION 10294: ADVANCING THE SAFE RESUMPTION OF GLOBAL TRAVEL DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, and I quote: " (President of US) determined it is in the national interest to permit temporarily the entry of noncitizen nonimmigrants who (1) are traveling with a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident; (2) were physically present in Ukraine as of February 10, 2022; and (3) possess valid travel documents allowing them to travel to the United States". He had a valid Ukraine passport with a visa that covers him under this mandate. They dismissed him in the most disrespectful manner and misguided him into staying in the airport without means to flying and German language deficiency to escalate the issue to proper channels to get on the flight. It is unacceptable handling of the matter by Condor as a company and its employees. We had to rebook a flight on United at triple the cost and he was able to fly with no issues or any Covid-19 constraints.

### "Never will book again with Condor"
Not Verified |  Horrible experience - their food and beverage was less than average, the food serving time was odd (lunch at 10:50 and dinner at 8pm). Their inflight entertainment is poor. They also lost my luggage and it is so difficult to talk to somebody or get any info. Their Whatsapp is a joke (doesn't work at any time or date), their live chat person was not available or when it was, gave me info I already found on the website, not useful at all to get the luggage or find its status. I also called the customer service and she hung up on me because I couldn't hear her I still don't know where my luggage is or who to contact. Never will book again with Condor.

### "Everything went extremely smoothly for such an unexpected delay"
My flight that was supposed to leave Frankfurt on Christmas Day was delayed by 24 hours. Thankfully, that was pretty much the only negative I have to say about the airline. As soon as Condor realized that they would not be able to get us out of Frankfurt, they sent our luggage to baggage claim and arranged for a shuttle bus to the hotel they paid for. Everything went extremely smoothly for such an unexpected delay (mechanical problems with the plane). Once on the plane, Condor allowed everyone to use the premium entertainment options, which meant I had plenty of movies to watch on the way back. When I requested the compensation guaranteed by EU regulations for long flight delays, Condor immediately replied that they would reimburse me. I ended up essentially paying nothing for a transatlantic flight during the busiest time of the year! I would feel comfortable flying on Condor again knowing that they will help make my journey smooth even if unanticipated problems occur.

### "will avoid the airline for future travel"
Booked ticket online. Online check-in was required, but didn't work properly. Lady on counter was not able to prove that online check-in is even possible which meant I got an extra charge for counter check-in. Airline looks like a fraud to me. I will avoid the airline for future travel.

### "no refund from them"
Booked tickets in February. Got canceled because of corona virus. Called and called the customer service number no answer for weeks. Called again in october cancelled the tickets they told me it will be 2 weeks to get the refund. Its been over a month and no refund from them. Called the accounting department and send numerous emails filed a complaint with the department of transportation here in the US. No manager available on the phone. Total chaos and who is responsible for taking so long.

### "Flight was better than expected"
Flight was better than expected, aircraft was clean and legroom was great for a low cost / tour operated airline. I had pre ordered snack was fine. There was pay menu service (even during covid-19 period). Crew (English speaking fluently) were eager to serve you and friendly. We were on time, on boarding they did not check for passenger locator form that Greek authorities required to enter the country, debarkation was on the new format: allowed it only by group of rows

### "hand disinfection  not provided"
At Condor, there are no security measures regarding Corona Virus. Flights are fully occupied. Masks or hand disinfection are not provided, before boarding, when boarding, or on the plane. The toilets were not cleaned or disinfected during the flight. Zero entertainment program. Uncomfortable and hard seats. All in all not recommended.

### "suggest that you do not use this airline"
Not Verified |  My wife and I booked flights on Expedia with Condor. The airiine canceled our flights without an explanation and no compensation or even a decent apology. The experience trying to contact customer service was a nightmare. I eventually reached a representative. When asked why our flight was canceled, the representative said that it due to the currently pandemic. When asked what about the pandemic, the representative responded " what do you think". I then said that I want to understand how the pandemic was impacting the airline and resulting in cancelations. He then explained that the German government government issued a warning that airlines from Germany should not travel to the USA. When I asked the representative how he might be able to assist with facilitating another flight he said that he could not help any further and I can expect my refund in 2 weeks. I so uncomfortable and disrespected by this agent. If you have another option, I strongly suggest that you do not use this airline.

### "stuck in Dominic Republic"
Due to the coronavirus our flight was cancelled back home. Then Condor promised us a new journey home later. And now we are stuck in Dominic Republic with no flights at all and Condor will not answer in the phone and they don't care about us at all. In mail the now tells us the will not be replacement journeys at all.

### "frustrating and horrible"
Seattle to Frankfurt. No customer service help whatsoever. I paid for round trip tickets that were canceled after getting to the destination. 3 hours on hold total. Not helpful with rebooking flight. Was charged $500 more to get home. The Alaska flight that took us from Seattle to Portland was connected to the Condor flight was canceled and never reimbursed. Attempted to resolve and not able to over the phone. Attempted to by online site but they want bank information that I am not willing to give them. They should be able to credit the credit card that they billed. Most frustrating and horrible customer service ever. Plus didn’t get our bags for 4 days so had to buy toiletries and some clothes.

### "never give them a second chance"
I was flying from Lanzarote to Munich, my luggage was lost and  80 suitcases of other passengers were delayed. First 5 days, they were saying, that I must be patient and, that they will start ‘extended search’ after 5 days. I called them after 5 days, they told me that I can fill the complaint form and I will receive an answer within 5-8 weeks! Thank you very much. After 8 days suitcase was brought by a postman: they did not even tried to send it fast. They told me, that they will call me to ask, when I will be at home – nobody called. They service hotline was only saying, that I can send them an email, that of course nobody was answering. After 25 days, I have received an answer to my complaint, that it seems, that everything is already delivered, that they do everything possible to avoid such situation (80 suitcases were missing) and that they hope I will give them a second chance. Hotline did not even called the airport or checked baggage status online, so I do not think, they did everything possible, I do not think they were sorry. I will personally never give them a second chance, it was too much stress for me.

### "everything like a budget flight"
Not Verified |  Frankfurt to Cancun. Never fly with Condor again. for an over 10 hours international flight it has only 4 free movies and 4 free episodes. The other movies you have to buy. No free headphones. No blanket on board. The seat has no head holder. Cabin crew barely smiles. They were doing everything like a robot. During online check-in seat cannot be chosen. Super uncomfortable for the journey. The meal has small portion and not tasty. They charged anyway quite a lot for the flight! But they run everything like a budget flight: need to pay additional for choosing seat, for free movies, for headphones, for additional food. Really disgusting operation strategy. Probably you need to pay extra for the cabin crew to smile at you! I give them 1 point because of the tasty desert.

### "Misleading upgrading process"
Frankfurt to Cancun. Misleading upgrading process from economy to premium economy through their website, resulting in a couple separated in a 11 hours flight. It gives the option to upgrade in step number one. It shows a premium economy box next to both names in the second step making you believe that you can pay for both and get upgraded. It charges only one upgraded seat in the payment step, because only one was available, although at the second step it sets the premium box sign next to both names. Thus a couple is separated in two different sections of the aircraft just because the algorithm tries to sell anything available by tricking the customers. Indifferent flight attendants that ignore an issue that occurs by the airline.

### "never travel with Condor again"
Not Verified |  Vancouver to Frankfurt. My partner and I flew Condor Airlines last year. There was a documentation issue and we asked to change our departure date, several days prior to the flight. Condor, unbelievably, refused to rebook our ticket over the phone and told us to try to rebook our ticket at the check-in counter, on the day of travel. Of course, the check-in counter could not help us other than to cancel our ticket. After spending several hours on the phone with the accounts department of Condor, we were given new tickets and an apology. The flight went without incident. Then, five months later on December 24th, we received a rude and demanding email that we should now pay for the first flight, which we had asked to be rebooked. We will never travel with Condor again.

### "never flying Condor Airlines again"
Cancun to Amsterdam via Frankfurt. I found the seats in Premium Economy worse than on many Economy flights. Considering it was a very long flight, I could not sleep at all as it was so uncomfortable. The portion size of the food was really small and even though I had asked for a gluten free meal, I was denied it because I didn’t have a receipt! Only one of the cabin crew were friendly. To top it off, no wifi was available! Needless to say, I am never flying with Condor Airlines again!

### "I will not ever fly them again"
Not Verified |  I flew on Condor several times when Lufthansa owned it and was delighted. They have since been sold to Thomas Cook and the experience was very poor for my flight from LAS to MUC. The seats are miserable — there is so little leg room, and I’m only about 5’8”. I have never been on such a pitiful long haul flight—and it is not inexpensive. They charge for movies—really?? And the change of planes in FRA was a complete disaster. No announcements or signage, and no one knew we had to check in again, or where to do so. Everyone was confused and angry. I will not ever fly them again.

### "incredibly unprofessional"
We flew from Kuala Lumpur to Frankfurt on 17th December 2019. We paid € 300 per person and I guess you get incredibly unprofessional service when you pay peanuts. We flew in a Boeing 757-300 on a long haul flight from Kuala Lumpur to Frankfurt. Way too small of an airplane to travel in! Small chairs, 3x3 with barely any legroom. - No in-flight entertainment! No screens in the back of the Plane seats, only old LCD screens from the ceiling in the middle, on which they showed flight information and in the morning exactly 1 hour of old episodes of some comedy series. No iPads, no WiFi for use with your own phone. No power sockets or USB chargers. Boarding started 1 hour later without any communication whatsoever to the passenger. Only when the boarding was finished (in a unprofessional way without microphone etc. ), the captain explained that there were problems with loading the food, because of the fact that the airplane was not suitable for such a long flight. These were his own words! Refueling in Dubai. Another sign that the airplane was not made for such long flights. We couldn't leave the airplane and it took a little more then an hour, before we took off for the next 7 hours. Breakfast was butter, jam, cheese, ham but no bread. No communication about the fact that there was no bread. Not one of the crew explained why there was not bread. Passengers had to ask themselves why there is no bread and some of them got a sandwich, while the rest wasn't even complaining because it's so weird I guess. Warm food was OK though. All and all, the whole charade looked incredibly unprofessional, it gave me a bad feeling. I will not ever advise anyone to fly with this organization!

### "don't think I'll fly Condor again"
This was my second flight with Condor. The first was two years ago and went fine. This scheduled flight was Frankfurt to Seattle via Las Vegas. The crew at the gate were disastrous. No announcements were made except to notify people that seats were available to upgrade at a reduced price even though people were queuing up to board in the line that was for a passport check, which resulted in boarding beginning 40 minutes late. Business class and premium economy board from the same lane at the same time; however, when in line I was told business class first. Fair enough. Then they called for premium. When I tried to board then the lady told me no, business class first. This happened twice more. The flight was then delayed for more than 2 hours for an engine repair. Seems like something that should have been caught earlier. Sitting in our seats for two hours with no air conditioning was unpleasant and the crew never offered even water. To make up for the inconvenience of the delay, everyone on the flight was offered access to the "premium entertainment. Which was nice, but for those in business class or premium who already had that access that didn't mean much. Flight was fine once we got going. Because of the delay we missed our connection to Seattle. I was pleasantly surprised that Condor did actually take care of things for us on this end (because we booked with them directly): they rebooked us for the next morning, covered the hotel, food vouchers, and transportation to/from the hotel. Ground service in Frankfurt was terrible but the assistance in Las Vegas was pleasant. Overall I don't think I'll fly Condor again.

### "The flight is delayed"
Frankfurt to Las Vegas. I am sitting in the dreadfully uncomfortable "waiting area" after "upgrading" for only $230! The flight is delayed again. No weather problems, etc. From Frankfurt airport, you are parked in the bowels of the airport just to find the gate. The staff is surly at best and the common response is: "What do you want me to do about it? There is no place to get food or even water.

### "Overall a good flight"
My experience exceeded my expectations. The flight between San Juan to Frankfurt was fully booked, I found staff at check-in pleasant and efficient. Boarding was a little chaotic, not clear where to queue up, boarding delayed and announcement made that boarding would be in zones, but it was really a free for all. This was not an issue as I find that random boarding is better than zone boarding as generally less people are completing for the same space on the aircraft. Ground staff could have managed cabin baggage better as some passengers were bringing more onboard than the 1 bag @ 8kg + small bag onboard. Larger bags do not fit into the middle lockers and need to be placed in the side lockers. I observed several passengers struggling to stow their bags and needed to find space away from their seats, but then again some passengers seem very adverse to putting their small bag below the seat in front of them. The flight left about 20mins late and the Pilot made a good announcement to explain why. We arrived on time in Frankfurt. The aircraft was clean with mood lighting, lockers and toilets which looked like they had recently been refurbished (bright and modern). I'm 5'9 and found the seat width and pitch no different from other airlines economy class. Seat did not have an adjustable headrest, but as a pillow and blanket were provided, so I found it comfortable for the 9 hour flight and was able to get quite a few hours of sleep. The in-flight entertainment was fine; limited free movies/tv show, however the free movie was a recent release and the screen resolution was of a high quality. Bring your own headsets or buy from the crew on board. Premium entertainment can be purchased for 9 Euro and the selection seemed good with a mixture or new releases and favorites. A meal was served about 60 mins after departure and the quantity (small salad, bread roll, hot pasta dish and desert) and taste was fine and better than expected for an operator such as Condor. About 90mins before arrival into FRA a light breakfast (roll, ham & cheese and fresh fruit) was also good. Soft drinks and tea/coffee are free and alcoholic drinks at Euro 5 is reasonable. Crew were fine; not overly friendly but efficient; meals served and cleared quickly. I observed a crew member during a service drawing a funny face on a napkin for a infant ... nice touch. Overall a good flight and considering the very reasonable fare and some entertainment, and meals were included. I'm glad I booked Condor and found it good value for money and I'd fly them again.

### "told that we missed our flight"
Frankfurt to Seattle. We rushed as fast as we could to catch our flight but security and custom lines took so much time. We arrived at our gate five minutes after checked and were told by a very rude Condor agent that we missed our flight. We asked what she could do to help us and she said “nothing, you will have to figure it out for yourself” and then she added “you might have to spend two more days in Frankfurt” We texted our friends who barely got on that flight, telling them that we missed our flight and they texted us back that Condor had just made an announcement that they would be 35-40 minutes delayed. We cold see the plane and we knew our luggage was on the plane already because we checked it into premier checking, as we had bought premier seats. Then we heard from our friends on the flight (six of them) that people were in our seats. That is when we figured out that Condor had already sold our seats - making double money from our original flight purchase. We found another agent from Lufthansa who was opposite the Condor agent we dealt with. She was very helpful. When she called the agent we first dealt with, she couldn’t get a response so she called another number for Condor and was able to get us tickets from Frankfurt to Las Vegas, leaving a couple hours later. The problem is we live in Seattle so we not only had to buy new Condor tickets to Las Vegas for $659.99, but we had to buy tickets from Las Vegas to Seattle on Alaska for $436.60 (a total of $1096.59. Condor made a huge profit from our initial return ticket purchase of $1309.98 by not only taking our money but then selling our first return ticket to someone else. They refused to help us get home so we had to buy another ticket from Condor ($659.99) and that only took us to Las Vegas. We had to spend an additional $436.60 for Alaska tickets to fly from Las Vegas to Seattle. The irony of this whole story is the plane that we missed was delayed an entire hour at Frankfurt. It would have been so easy to have let us on board since we were just five minutes late. They had to take our luggage off the plane and transfer to our new flight. What a waste of time and energy.

### "real hit or miss"
Not Verified | Frankfurt to Seattle. The cabin crew were real hit or miss. One flight attendant was probably the rudest airline employee I've ever met (and I used to work for an airline). Very sarcastic, he corrected me saying they don't have coffee with milk, just coffee with cream. Ok guy. Then complained that this "wasn't a gym" when three of us were stretching in the aft of the aircraft. He also passive-aggressively knocked me in my glasses once reaching over (I'm assuming) and when exiting the aircraft stepped forward to bump shoulders with me. He was also rude to the other crew and passengers. But then randomly nice to some others. That would have never happened on ANA or another real airline where I pay literally half as much for infinitely better service. The food wasn't too bad and I liked the seat in coach though slightly cramped.

### "9 Euros to watch movies"
Frankfurt to Seattle. 9 Euros to watch movies on a 10-hour flight, alcoholic beverages are not complimentary, and the credit card processing machines to purchase items in flight are not compatible with US cards which results with the flight attendants being rude and impatient with you about not having euros in cash to pay as a backup. Flight was delayed by 50 minutes. Never again will I fly with this airline.

### "rude and miserable people"
Not Verified |  The worst airline I have flown with, ground staff at Frankfurt are rude and icy beyond belief. The aggressive woman at the gate (Frankfurt) was refusing to allow me to go to the toilet, when I pointed out they had not provided toilets and that I needed to go she reluctantly agreed but snarled that she would unload me if the bus arrived. On my return she threw my ticket at me - the bus arrived 30 minutes later! I have flown twice to Anchorage with them, Cabin crew give the impression they do not want to be there, if you do see a smile it appears forced and fake, it’s as if they resent doing their job. Food was just about edible, pasta tubes with a sauce on both legs. No water for first two hours on return flight and no ability to purchase water after security at Anchorage North terminal. All entertainment has to be paid for. Check in is at ANC south terminal, departure is from the north terminal, of course Condor do not tell anyone this so people wandering the terminal looking lost. Check in staff at Anchorage were pleasant enough - they are not Condor staff. This airline could learn a lot from the likes of Virgin on employing the right type of staff. I wish there was another airline that flew direct to Anchorage that is as cheap as Condor, until then we will have to suck it up with these rude and miserable people.

### "Just a bit more legroom"
Frankfurt to Seattle. Premium economy is not worth the money. Pretty much no difference to economy seats. Just a bit more legroom and less horrible food. Save your money and spend it on a hotel upgrade. It’s a rip-off. In addition, old planes, no WiFi and never on time. Bus transfer to the plane in Frankfurt is  annoying.

### "will never ever fly again with Condor"
Vancouver to Frankfurt. I have never seen an airline that charges for alcoholic drinks or watching a movie. They ask 5 euros for a very very small bottle of Whiskey. Additionally, their crew are not friendly, that makes people hesitate to ask a glass of water. The ground service was not professional, they made us so confused and frustrated about how to get our tax free refund. I will never ever fly again with Condor.

### "experience was the worst by far"
Pittsburgh to Moscow via Frankfurt. In 30 yrs of international travel, this experience was the worst by far. Their partner airline bumped me off the second leg of the flight due to overbooking and offered zero compensation on the way there. I had to buy a hotel night and paid for a separate flight (with a different airline, obviously). Total losses: $850, 36 hrs, millions of nerves cells and a massive bruise to my dignity. On the way back, they broke my luggage and have refused to pay, blaming everyone and their dog but themselves (for what, a $100 at best?). Between emails and phone calls, I have spent multiple hours with them to no avail: they keep pointing fingers to the airport of departure, of arrival, their partner airline, myself (yep, I am at fault for them damaging my luggage). I mean, they made the whole trip the worst ever and took zero responsibility. Not once throughout the entire debacle did I hear one word of empathy from any of their staff. Shameful, really. Avoid at any cost.

### "avoid to use this airline again"
Frankfurt to San Jose via Santo Domingo. I can't believe they just give you 1 movie on economy class. Another bad thing is the food, very poor, and they give you the food in a rude way, same as some of the personnel they are rude,  with I dont care. I will avoid to use this airline again.

### "charges to watch movies"
Frankfurt to Vancouver. I have never once been on a plane that charges to watch movies. I board my 10.5 hour flight on Condor from Frankfurt to Vancouver and they give you 1 free movie and you don’t even get to choose it - I then went to pick another movie which costs money on top of that alcoholic drinks aren’t included. I flew same route on Air Canada on a cheaper ticket and had unlimited drinks and entertainment no extra costs it’s pathetic condor you suck I hope you realize that’s robbery

### "the legroom was not spacious"
Cancun to Munich. I had an issue with some passengers seated behind me, they were quite tall and wouldn´t allow me to recline the seat because the legroom was not spacious, they started screaming and making a scene and the staff decided to stay out of it, so the whole 8 hour flight I didn´t recline my seat, which was very uncomfortable. Other than that the flight was ok and the food was pretty good. For the economy class the seats just suck in my opinion, I am 1.72 cm tall and the legroom was no good, you should consider business class if flying with Condor Airlines, but got to say the space and the plane its much better than Aeromexico or Air France.

### "satisfied with this airline"
Munich to Preveza. Overall i was satisfied with this airline. I flew with them for the first time and there was only one problem and that the flight was delayed by 15 minutes. Everything was fine on board. The service was above average in this price category and the prices of refreshments weren’t all that bad. The seats were average and mine was missing the hand rest cushion which was quite uncomfortable. The airplane itself was clean and in a good condition given it was 20 years old.

### "Coming home was an absolute trial"
Frankfurt to Baltimore. Beware if your flight says that it is being fulfilled through Air Tanker. My initial flight into Germany was fine, but only fine. The flight wasn't full, but I still felt very crammed in. The food, if you don't spend extra money on their Premium menu, is not much and about the same quality as a hospital cafeteria. It was all solidly "meh". I'd been snapped at for not having my passport ready as I stepped into the plane, yet nobody had instructed me to do that and it was my first international flight. They also, for some reason, made an announcement that they would be checking passports upon exit, but they didn't actually do this. Eventually we got to Frankfurt though, and I found myself feeling solidly underwhelmed by the experience. Coming home was an absolute trial. I checked in online 24 hours beforehand, and when I showed up the next day, a good four hours before my flight, I received a nasty surprise. I waited in line to check in my bag, and after finally getting up to the desk, was informed that I needed to go to the Service Area, that everyone did, and to not worry because "nothing was wrong with my booking. Yet there was clearly something wrong because the woman looked very uncomfortable. The Service Area was a disaster, and I waited in a barely moving line for an extremely long time to be finally told that I would be getting pushed off into Lufthansa's lap. One man working the desk and constantly answering a frantically ringing phone, trying to deal with an entire plane full of people who had just learned that Condor was using a smaller plane and had ditched them. They needed three or four of him. I was given vague directions as to where to go, worried that I wouldn't have time to catch this new, much earlier, flight. I finally got face to face with a Lufthansa rep as my new flight was starting to board, and she couldn't even find my name in the system because Condor hadn't bothered to send it. That took a good fifteen minutes to fix by itself. I was told by professionals and other travelers alike that this haphazard downgrading of flights is very typical of Condor. They promised reimbursement of 300 euros for the flight, and of course as I tried to file the paperwork for it they are trying to give that reimbursement as vouchers for future flights with them. If I am ever lucky enough to fly to Europe again, it will not be with them. Lufthansa proved to me that they know what they are doing and how to treat their customers, even when faced with a swarm of stressed out people suddenly on their doorstep. Lufthansa had great food and great service, and in the future I will definitely be willing to pay a little bit more than what Condor is asking for peace of mind.

### "I shall avoid Condor in future"
As a regular passenger with Condor I had booked a Business class ticket for a return flight from Halifax to Friedrichshafen via Frankfurt. On check-in I was notified by ground staff that the airline had sent a smaller aircraft that was not equipped with business class seats. I was handed a form that would enable me to apply for a refund of the ticket price difference. The flight was extremely uncomfortable. They obviously were sending an old aircraft with old interior and very little legroom on pure economic grounds because business was not fully booked. This way they sacrifice customer satisfaction for some operational savings. Doesn‘t look like a sustainable strategy! I was a Platinum Voyager traveller with SAA for 5 years and Lufthansa Senator for another 10 years. I am tall and was struggling all the way to Frankfurt. As most passengers do I book higher class transportation for a reason. An involuntary downgrade with an offer to refund solely for the different ticket price doesn‘t do the trick. It certainly looks for them as an easy way out. I shall avoid Condor airline in future!

### "I didn’t get any bags"
I had my flight on 18 July 2019 from Zagreb to Frankfurt to Calgary. I was told by the check in staff at Zagreb that I will have to pick the 2 checked bags at Calgary for customs as it’s the first destination to enter Canada. However, I didn’t receive either of them in Calgary. I was then directed to baggage counter where I filed lost baggage for my 2 bags and boarded my flight to Vancouver. I didn’t get any bags there too. As WestJet was the domestic flight from Calgary to Vancouver, I filed a complaint about the lost bags with them at Vancouver. After that day I tried calling Condor customer care to ask about the bags, one of the staff mentioned that I can contact them on 5th day if I still didn’t receive the bags. However, there was no response on my bags till 23rd July so I decided to call condor customer care, I spoke to very arrogant staff. Instead of understanding my issue, she preferred to act as if she is doing any favour on me and didn’t even hear to what I wanted to say, she mentioned that they are not responsible for the same and the airport is responsible.

### "Worst airline experience"
Not Verified |  Frankfurt to Las Vegas. Worst airline experience I’ve ever had. To start with, we arrived at the ticket counter and here they told us that they switched the plane and this plane doesn’t have business class. So we paid for business class but have to fly economy. There was no warning before that they had switched the flight, then there was absolutely no help from anyone (and with big attitudes) to see if we could switch our flight to go business class (like we had paid for). They were unwilling to help. Then we arrived at our gate, got our boarding tickets scanner and i was selected for random security. Once i was done there, i had to walk back to my gate where i was met with attitude again. I wanted to pass because i had already gone past but selected for random security. I got yelled at by the man passing the boarding passes even though he was the one who took me to security. Honestly an awful experience and will never fly Condor again and caution you against it as well.

### "worst food ever served"
Phoenix to Frankfurt. Everything about it is a budget airline and that is okay. The non-stop route was a major factor for flying them. The problem I had is the plane had no air vents, very, very warm and uncomfortable. Seats are not well set up for long haul flights. Armrests hard and unpadded, no tray for devices, not well cleaned. Further, the absolute worst food ever served. We didn't even bother look at it on the return. Several other passengers made similar comments. The inbound flight had some air movement, that helped alot. Nice crew and ground. It will take a really good price for me to use them again.

### "worst airline experiences"
This is one of the worst airline experiences I've had. I booked premium economy from the Bay Area to Milan through Frankfurt. I booked with Condor because they used Alaska and Lufthansa to support the US and EU legs of the trip. Unfortunately, Condor does the overnight trip. First, Condor sends out a PDF receipt/schedule that looks like it was generated from an antiquated green screen technology. It's incredibly hard to understand and you have to manually port over into a calendar. Second, after the receipt, you get no communication from them whatsoever. No reminder, no notice of schedule changes - nothing. Second, their customer service is a total joke. Third, food is awful. For premium economy, it's insufficient to say the least. Finally, it is incredibly uncomfortable. While premium isn't business or first, I've always found it pretty comfortable and have been able to sleep. Not so for Condor. You can recline your chair maybe 1" more than you would in economy. There is a lot of leg room, but every time your neighbor moves or readjusts his or her sleeping position, it feels like an eight year old is kicking the back of your seat. The WiFi did not work and there are no power outlets. The movie selection sucks and is really hard to use. Will never book Condor again.

### "meals and entertainment are decent"
I fly to Europe every summer from Alaska to Ukraine via Switzerland, Germany or Netherlands. Condor is my favorite choice for this trip. Their prices almost always beat other airlines. The meals and entertainment are decent and service superb. For the last 10 years I’ve been traveling my luggage was always arriving safely and flights that were on time, no cancellations nor delays. I had a few small problems with customer service when I had to get a person via the phone while trying to change a flight from Ukraine online (not available). Other than that it was nice, and I flew with kids and oversized bags. Yes Germans likes their rules and unlike American Airlines will suggest you pay extra if your bags are ridiculously overweight. However just as likely they will let it slip if you have a child or are just stressed out or broke (I've had all situations above over the years). As for the crew being unapproachable, perhaps flight attendants are more reserved however when it comes to being helpful they are superb crew. Overall highly recommend for budget, family, eastern European connections and last minute business class upgrade travelers. Alaska flight is just gorgeous and the shortest too. Very safe and decent service. A bit of a clunky website or stiff regulations are not huge obstacle when it comes to competitive prices and convenience.

### "You get what you pay for"
Phoenix to Frankfurt. You get what you pay for and Condor can be hit and miss. Condor strictly strictly enforces its baggage policy. Before being allowed to proceed to the check-in counter the airline weighs both the checked luggage as well as hand-carry on, which is limited to 8 kg. People who are used to traveling with a small suitcase as carry-on are in for a rough surprise since passengers in economy are not allowed to use the overhead bins to stow luggage. I noticed quite a few people who were pulled aside to pay for excess baggage or repack their luggage and get rid of things. The boarding process in Phoenix was chaos, but I give them credit since the airline only started serving PHX the week before and the staff didn't have much experience. It was, however, very unprofessional for the staff to be arguing with each other as to how to handle the boarding process. Flights to the U.S. originate in Frankfurt and return that same day, which means that there are no representatives available to deal with incoming passengers who encounter problems with their luggage because the airline's staff is busy checking people in. This happened to me on my return flight from Frankfurt to Phoenix when my luggage didn't arrive after waiting for over an hour. There was no Condor representative in the baggage area and a customs officer finally told me to go to the Condor ticketing/check-in area to file a claim. Once there I was told that they didn't have time to deal with me since they had to finish checking-in people for the return flight to Frankfurt. Absolutely unacceptable. The service on board can be hit and miss. I purchased upgrades to premium economy on both flights at check-in. The service on the flight from PHX - FRA was friendly and efficient. The service on the return flight was very poor and non-existent between meal services. On the 12 hour flight from FRA to PHX the crew came around with water only once, compared to five time on the PHX - FRA flight. When I asked for a glass of wine I was told by the flight attendant to get it myself in the galley - and this was in premium economy! Three of the flight attendants looked and seemed very stern and unapproachable. The meals in premium economy are slightly better than in economy, with a choice of two meals instead of the pasta dish in regular economy. The quality and presentation of the food, however, is nothing compared to that served on mainstream airlines like Lufthansa or British Airways. Condor uses bus boarding in Frankfurt for many flights, which is time consuming and inconvenient. The price I paid for these flights was a fraction of what I would've had to pay on a mainstream airline. You can purchase upgrades to premium economy, which offers 36" of legroom, at check-in subject to availability.

### "abandoned customers mid-trip"
We booked flights on Condor.com from Seattle to Vienna via Frankfurt. We barely missed our connection by a few minutes, after a series of delays waiting for shuttle buses and long lines at passport control and security checks. We even ran the half mile down terminal A to catch our flight but the door had just closed. There was just no way to have made the connection in time (and we are middle-aged and healthy). We expected Condor would simply rebook us on a later flight, or set us up for standby seats. Instead, they told us we were on our own. They said that their policy (not written anywhere) is that you have one hour to make your connection. After that, it's not their problem. We had to purchase entirely new tickets from Frankfurt to Vienna to complete our trip. Expensive! In all our years of flying, we have never experienced an airline that abandoned its customers mid-trip - and my wife is a travel agent. Condor is for people who want to save a buck and are willing to take a big risk. I would question the safety of an airline that operates this way.

### "have never known an airline to be so greedy"
Real horrible experience with Condor Airlines. I was charged for earphones only to be short changed by over 8 dollars. When questioned the staff member she couldn't explain and said she would sort it when landed. After 11 hour flight no attempts were made to return money. This airline charges to watch movies and charges for absolutely everything. I have never known an airline to be so greedy. Should be called con airlines. Never again avoid this company like plague. I have flown with British Airways, American Airlines, Emirates etc and have never been made to feel so cheap.

### "had a really good experience"
Frankfurt to Cape Town with Condor. I was nervous about flying with Condor because of all the bad reviews. I had a really good experience. I decided not to pay extra for a vegetarian meal, but it happened to be vegetarian anyway. They were constantly serving drinks throughout the flight. Flight attendants were really friendly.

### "very uncomfortable seats"
Seattle to Frankfurt. If you like very uncomfortable seats this airline is for you, if you being told that your seat which you paid for was unavailable this airline is for you. I walked right by it and someone was sitting in my seat. I certainly will not fly on this airline cause it’s not for me.

### "everything is paid extra"
Las Vegas to Frankfurt. 2 movies for free, everything is paid extra, food is scarce. We got delayed with no support or help regarding  if or when to transfer to any rebooked flight. My bag was lost and came 3 days later.

### "administration is a mess"
8 months after the return flight from Corfu to Frankfurt I received several e-mails that wrongly say that part of the costs are still to be paid. This airline's administration is a mess. Apart from that we booked Priority and paid for it, didn't receive any other treatment than any other passenger though.

### "fought for and got a refund"
Actually, I must admit that I’ve never flown with Condor but I did have a flight booked. Turns out my flight from Las Vegas to Frankfurt was cancelled because the plane never left Frankfurt in the first place. Unfortunately, Condor failed to even notify me. Long story short. I ended up cancelling the whole trip and requested a full refund. After much back and forth that was in and of itself pretty bizarre (at one point I received a refund check and a bill within days of each other), Condor did refund the ticket and I figured that was that. Fast forward 6 months and I’m trying to book another flight to Germany to visit my mother who is having health issues  and figured I was ready to forgive and forget the past negative experience with Condor so I attempted to book a flight with them. Well, at first I thought they had possibly flagged my credit card because my payment was declined ( the credit card company confirmed there were no issues with the card). I tried my debit card - same result. I tried one more time with my partners card (different last name, etc.) to no avail. So, my conclusion is that Condor has blacklisted me as a passenger because I fought for and got a refund. I guess they won’t ever be getting my business again nor that of a few additional family members.

### "Condor, never again"
Frankfurt to Seattle. I’ll never fly Condor again. The boarding process was a nightmare— we were supposed to take off at 2pm, but we weren’t even finished boarding at that point. They had us go through like 3 different (useless) checkpoints which wasted so much time. Then, on the runway, we had to “wait for paperwork” (?) for another 15 minutes. Ended up landing 40min after we were supposed to, costing me my connecting flight and another $150. Onboard food was beyond lackluster, entertainment was laughably lacking, and attendants were unfriendly. Never again, Condor, never again. What a joke.

### "I am very disappointed"
The flight itself was okay. There were only little things to eat and only non-alcoholic drinks included. The real problem was that our luggage did not arrive at our destination. There was no response to e-mails and contact via forms on the website. A live chat on the website was responding but they could not help. Contacting them via forms provided for reimbursement of unplanned expenses (we had to make a lot of phone calls, make taxi rides and restructure our vacation to get our lost luggage) was not responded again. Another contact on the live chat was simply canceled because the employee said he could not help again. I am very disappointed. I will not fly with Condor anymore and I do not recommend it.

### "would never fly Condor again"
Flying from Seattle to Frankfurt and Frankfurt to Minneapolis. Paid extra for premium class. Outbound, seating no different than plain economy and food services so-so. Inbound, seating was tighter than plain old economy, it was apparent that they added extra rows of seating after 1.5 hour delay in Frankfurt. Food service was terrible. At start of travel in Seattle they did not even load our luggage onto plane and luggage did not show up until 3 days later in Prague. Great start of 2 week trip to Eastern Europe. It is now mid February and they have not yet reimbursed us after many claims, emails and calls for our inconvenience of 3 days in Europe without bare essentials and our premium upgrade which was worse than any economy I have ever flown. So far, their excuse is they have many claims to handle. They are owned by Thomas Cook Travel and they refuse to intervene. We would never use fly Condor again nor use Thomas Cooke.

### "Seat space was not existing"
Frankfurt to Hurghada. Check in was very unorganized. no difference between baggage drop off and regular check in. boarding was very stressful (50 min). Premium meal was ok, but the price is a rip off. Seat space was not existing (1.60m) normally even with Ryanair i have no problem. Crew was friendly. But I have to say that the crew had a really a hard time with some disgusting tourists. I will not fly condor again mostly because of their passengers and non existing seat space.

### "the crew did a good job"
Kuala Lumpur to Frankfurt. I believe this is the worst long distance flight I ever took, and the flight took place in a new aircraft. First, leg space is unbearable and seat quality is rubbish. You have to pay for in-flight entertainment and headphones, makes 11 euro per seat. Else you may watch 4 preselected movies. . The ingredients for food are very cheap and have bad taste. You get bombarded by in-flight selling every hour or so (on a long distance night flight), so you cannot fall asleep. The toilets stank when boarding the aircraft (new plane). I must stress out that the crew did a good job in general, the only positive thing. Finally, even if Condor is a low cost carrier, you still pay a certain amount of money for it. However downgrading services at such a low and unacceptable level is shameful and shows how every penny gets squeezed out of you nowadays. The German word Servicewueste - service desert - describes best Condors flight politics. A swift change in Condors flight conditions will be greatly appreciated. Until then, never again.

### "the seating was unbearable"
Not Verified |  Frankfurt to Seattle. The food was nice the staff was nice but the seating was unbearable. Not only was the space far to small but the men in the seat in front of me insisted on reclining right back. The man in front of me in the return flight was so heavy he literally crushed my knees. If passengers cannot have adequate space the seats should not be allowed to recline and cause injury to other passengers. I would not recommend you to anyone after my experience.

### "water bottle had to be paid"
Frankfurt to Hurghada. The check-in was fast and the standards accordingly. The departure and arrival were delayed by about 30 minutes. The seating comfort was down to the usual average. Too short and too close seats. No drinks or meals were provided as a service. Even the smallest water bottle had to be paid, as with low coast airlines. The entertainment program was designed really for small children or it was shown ancient series movies. For adults an impertinence on a 4.5 hour flight. Even if the aircraft is probably already 20 years old or it was mostly package holiday travelers, this cannot be cited as an apology.

### "they have no contingency plans"
I'll put this in points, because there's some advice. We booked to fly from Manchester, UK, to New York, and back to Manchester from Los Angeles a month later. Since we wanted to sit together, we pre-booked seats, at £25 each for each way, adding £100 to the cost of the flight. We also booked an extra bag in the hold. Going to New York was fine. We took off, landed and that was that. No decent movies, cramped leg room, awful food, but we knew what we were getting into going in, so we came prepared with our own food and movies. First piece of advice - take your own movies, headphones, and water. After a month, we got to LA airport to fly home. When we checked in, the woman on the desk tried a scam. It says on the website that you are allowed one piece of luggage, plus a "handbag" or laptop bag. The sizes are quite small, but all I was concerned about was my old-fashioned laptop that weighs a lot. They tried to convince us that the weight was for both items, went so far as to say that was what it said on the website. I pulled the relevant page up on my phone, and only then did the woman give in. The alternative was to pay airport prices for the bag to be stowed in the hold. Second piece of advice - weigh your carry on carefully, because they will, and wear a coat with deep pockets, so you can stuff the excess in there. At least they don't weigh that. The plane was four and a half hours late. We got a variety of explanations, none of which seemed right. And we were never offered refreshments or vouchers, which is a statutory requirement if the airline is in the EU area. They just left us, and gave wild excuses. Either they didn't know, or they didn't want to tell us. Third piece of advice. Take photographs of the departure board. When you claim, they will try to say that you are wrong. Finally we got on the plane. They gave us free access to the full entertainments package as compensation. I used my tablet to watch the Netflix movies I'd previously downloaded. We arrived at Manchester just over three hours late. Fourth piece of advice - however tired you are, take photos of the arrival boards, and because you're tired, make notes of what they actually said. And take your own blanket, or coat, because they don't have any. Ever since May we've been trying to get compensation, and all Thomas Cook did was offer us £100 compensation. We haven't accepted it. If something goes wrong, and it seems that happens a lot, they are working on such a shoestring that they have no contingency plans. The planes are old, cramped and tired, and don't expect decent food or entertainment on long haul flights. Budget is fine, but not their response to complaints. If it hadn't been for those, I might have chalked it down to experience, but no.

### "both flights were wonderful"
Portland to Frankfurt. Excellent value. Expected to have a miserable experience for such a low fare, but both flight out and return were wonderful. Even food was better than higher cost airlines. The only downside is 30" legroom, but it wasn't uncomfortable.

### "do not recommend this company"
The flight DE2402 from Frankfurt to Toronto had been delayed for more than 2 hours without announcing any reason. When I had requested the reason from Condor customer support by calling 1-866-960-7915, I had been redirected by the first agent to request the reason from Toronto (Pearson) airport and the Condor agent had also mentioned that no compensation for delays can be expected. Toronto Pearson airport rejected the request and confirmed it's Condor's airline responsibility to provides updated on delays and reasons for them which sounds valid. So I called 2nd time to the same Condor number and was told they are not going to give any updates on their delays as these delays are very frequent and happen all the time. Condor reps had been rude and not helpful. I do not recommend this company to anyone.

### "exceeded our expectations"
Frankfurt to Seattle. Condor exceeded our expectations. We read other reviews and were prepared for a worse than United or Delta experience. Condor was cheaper and better. New plane, very clean, good food, nice staff. Left on time and arrived early. Free movies were limited to two: but one was a favorite all-time movie for us and the other we hadn’t yet seen. Hubby watched his favorite and I read a very long book. So, by not having a hundred movies to choose from, we saved many hundreds of dollars. Now, I admit that there was one issue- we booked through Travelocity from Frankfurt to Salt Lake City Via Seattle. Condor sent a schedule change that would not have allowed us enough time to get through customs in Seattle to make our connection to SLC. I called Travelocity and they fixed it for me.

### "very friendly staff"
Excellent experience overal with a very competitive in-flight product. I typically fly major carriers in Business including AA, Delta, United. Even though Condor may not offer a fancy flat bed like the major carriers, it is a very comfortable lie flat seat (170 degree angle) 4 times cheaper. The Good: Very clean airplane - Lie flat seat - Very good entertainment system with large screen - Amazing service and very friendly staff. Very good and abundant food and beverages. The Bad: - Entertainment could have a few more movies - No Internet - Boarding was really chaotic - Seat position cannot be adjusted when table is out (weird) - Only 1 bathroom for Business class section.

### "completely regret not listening"
Anchorage to Frankfurt. Before flying with Condor, I of course read the reviews before spending a large sum of money on an airline I’ve never been on -  I completely regret not listening! On my departure date I checked in online and my boarding pass claimed I was on standby with no other information online in regards about our flight status. I attempted to call Condor whom charged me .35 cents/minute and was on hold for over 20 minutes before being disconnected by your service. My significant other and I had no other option but head to the airport 4 hours early to ensure we were going to have a seat on our departing flight. We were told by condor employees that we were involuntarily downgraded from Business class but did not have a seat assigned for us yet. They claimed the previous plane was out of service and had to bring a smaller plane to the airport. Not only was our flight delayed by 2 hours but we were eventually forced to premium class seating. I received a toll-free phone Number to contact Condor in regards to a refund for our business class seats. When calling this number it was a Thomas Cook employee who claimed he could not help us because the company was not affiliated with Condor. My significant other asked to speak to a manager and we were put on hold. Their holding music was of course the theme song for Condor, we were then again intentionally disconnected by your service team and were left with no assistance. I'm very disappointed in the service I've received not only at the airport Condor employees but as well as the Frankfurt Condor employees who were never able to answer our questions and the only option was to email the company. With the stress your company has put me through to get to Europe was absolutely disappointing. And the customer service is disgusting, there is Literally no way to contact you without being charge money by the minute to speak Condor. Even the US number that was given to me so I could speak with a Condor representative was inaccurate. It was an employee that worked with Thomas Cook who refused to help me and had no contact information to provide me to contact the correct company. I will never recommend anyone to ever use this disgusting service.

### "It was horrible"
Not Verified | Venice to Baltimore via Frankfurt. It was horrible. Never fly this airline. Flight going, they did not have wheelchair waiting in Frankfurt. Missed flight. Very hard time trying to find someone to speak to. Had to wait around for hours to take another flight. Got to the airport three hours early so I could do duty free but kept taking other passengers to flights so ended up not being able to do any duty free because they took us 15 minutes before boarding.

### "Customer service was a joke"
Toronto to Frankfurt. Our flight was delayed 27 hours and at the Check in I was told I could purchase new tickets and would be refunded my money back for the flight that was rescheduled in its entirety. A rescheduled flight was not an option for this trip as the new departure time would make me miss my fathers funeral in Hungary. They provided no alternate way for me to get to my destination except for the purchase of new tickets on my own. I filed the complaint as I was told to, and 4 weeks later received an e-mail stating I would be refunded less then half of what I paid for the original tickets, plus I had to purchase new tickets as well. Customer service was a joke, they said there was absolutely no one that I could speak with in regards to this matter and refused to transfer me to her supervisor as he had more important things to do. My only option being to email the complaint company and hope for a response. Save yourself some time, money and sanity and fly with a different airline.

### "Absolutely despicable"
Frankfurt to New Orleans. I didn't think the reviews were as accurate as everyone makes them out to be. Awful airline. Made us recheck our bags which made us late and then wouldn't let us board. The employees even said it was "our fault and we would need to buy a new ticket with them. 2,500€ ticket for one person on a whim and we would have had to wait 4 days in the airport? No thanks. The amount if unhelpfulness was astounding. In fact the last minute ticket people were miles more helpful in getting me home that day. Absolutely despicable, will never even consider this airline again and I urge everyone else to consider other airlines. The extra price is worth it as in my case I just completely lost the entire ticket cost.

### "It is not worth the money"
Frankfurt to Austin. Do not use this airline! 6 hours of delays on my first flight. They messed up my meal and the flight attendants were very unfriendly and made me feel like I was unwelcome. Once I arrived in Frankfurt I find out that due to their delays I had missed my connecting flight. I was told I had to go over to their ticket counter and get rebooked and the when I arrived the lady said they had already rebooked me as if I had any way of knowing. Return flight was also delayed 2hrs. No meal again, had to buy a snack. Was starving after 13hr flight. I arrive in Texas and find out my luggage was lost. It has been a week and Condor is refusing to help me. I have followed all their instructions with no results. If you call them they are rude, if you email them you get a auto reply. This airline is not the fastest route due to their  delays. It is not worth the money and it could end up costing you money of they lose your bag.

### "horribly uncomfortable seats"
Not Verified |  Seattle to Frankfort. Horrible - I have never flown an international flight with such a small space. 12 hours in a seat that is so small that even my 5'4" frame banged the seat in front of me. Plus, the cushion on the seat is terrible. I only flew this flight because it code shares with Alaska Airlines (my favorite airline) and I wanted to use my miles to bring my daughter along on a business trip. Never again. And it wasn't particularly cheap, either. By the time I paid to choose a seat (how can that be considered extra?) and check a bag (should be included on an international flight), it wasn't really any cheaper than the others. I did not know how bad it would be. I luckily was able to get an aisle seat so that I could get up from the horribly uncomfortable seats. In addition, the flight out of Seattle 3 hours late! (yet it arrived on time, making me believe that they are seriously padding their flight times).

### "never fly this airline again"
We flew with Condor from Frankfurt to Portland and back. We have had our 8 month old baby (lap infant) and our dog (in cargo area) with us. Both flights were delayed due to problems with the plane (AC broken on our way to the US which resulted in a 2h delay while we were boarded already, the cabin felt like a sauna with over 100F outside, our poor dog in the cargo area / plane overbooked in business class on our way back with re-seating passengers). There was no service during that time like providing the passengers with water in the heat. As a breastfeeding mum I requested water frequently and was denied  it mid-flight on both routes. The crew was unfriendly, brief and didn´t care much about our comfort nor the comfort of our baby (we have tried to get Premium Economy seats). The food was horrible, it´s pasta with tomato sauce both ways on a 11h flight. The in-flight entertainment is a joke, even with the upgrade (which costs 10 EUR per passenger) it´s not any better since there´s nothing interesting to watch (no new movies or shows). The seats are very uncomfortable, there is no head rests that can be adjusted. Bringing a travel pillow is a must. But the worst part was the transport of our poor dog: we have picked up a very stressed dog in FRA whose muzzle was raw and bloody. He must have been trying to get out of the kennel in panic. What caused it unfortunately remains unknown. Also, since given ice cubes (recommended by the airline staff) instead of water, suffered immense diarrhea (due to enteritis, my friend is a vet and examined him right after we got home) and was literally swimming in it in his kennel. Condor´s customer service is a zoo, nobody feels responsible for anything there and we just got forwarded back and forth to different agents for several days, which is why I end up writing this review because we certainly will never fly with this airline again. I have to give a 1 to post this review but I would give a zero.

### "Terrible inflight service"
Frankfurt to Portland. Terrible inflight service. Airport attendants were not helpful in the least. No way to change seating, I was told the flight was full but there were at least 25 open seats (yes I counted and yes I took one). In flight entertainment is non existent even for 11+ hour flights. Food made me sick. Worst flying experience of my life.

### "attendant changed my seat"
Anchorage to Frankfurt. I paid for an emergency row seat as I’m extremely tall. Upon checking in, I saw that the gate attendant changed my seat to a regular one. By the time I got through the customer service line, all exit row seats were booked. So I was in regular seat for 10 hours. I emailed condor over 1.5 months ago for a refund and haven’t heard back outside of their email confirming receipt of my contact. Never again.

### "customer service a joke"
Toronto to Frankfurt. The flight and inflight service were mediocre at best. The customer service is an absolute joke, when I called with an issue they were completely useless and couldn't point me in the direction of anyone that could help me. Incredibly disorganized company, it is an enormous headache to get assistance from them.

### "absolute worst airline"
Seattle to Berlin via Frankfurt. The absolute worst airline that I have ever flown with. We booked our seats 3 months in advance. I booked an upgraded seat in the exit row. Paid an extra $500 total for the upgrade. The day before our flight I see that we were bumped from our seats and were now in the last row of the plane. I was furious. I called and their customer service is a joke. They gave no help. Then when speaking to an agent at our airport, the seats on our boarding pass did not exist! Luckily there were 2 seats available on the plane, but again we were placed in the back of a section so our seats did not recline at all. Furthermore, when the people in front of us reclined, we were basically stuck in our seats. It was the most uncomfortable and horrible 12 hours of my life. We still haven't been refunded for our upgrade either. Avoid at all costs. If I could rate a negative 10, I would.

### "I feel ripped off"
Portland to Frankfurt. I bought a business class ticket for myself and my sister for our flight to Frankfurt. They took our money and did not deliver the service. My sister got business class seat and I was given an economy seat on 22C. The captain apologized but I have two joint replacements and was very uncomfortable. There was no mention of reimbursement of my business class ticket. I feel ripped off.

### "the worst airline ever"
Not Verified |  Flew Frankfurt to Vancouver. Absolutely the worst airline ever, starting from the boarding process to clearing through US customs in Vancouver. Waited over an hour to clear customs due to incompetent baggage handling on the part of Condor. Had to wait in a holding area with multiple passengers while we all waited for luggage to complete inspections. I will never ever fly with Condor again. Do yourself a favor and pay the extra money to fly with someone else.

### "super friendly and helpful"
Seattle to Manchester. I checked prices of tickets to Manchester and saw that Condor Airlines was by far the most economical. After booking I thought I would check the reviews to get an idea of what to expect. Imagine my dismay when I read the poor reviews. I thought to keep an open mind which I did. Thank goodness. I don't know what people expect when flying economy, but I found the flight attendants to be super friendly and helpful; check in etc was a smooth process; food was fine (chicken curry on the way back was delish and there was ice cream) and there was a blanket, bottle of water, and a pillow on my seat when I boarded, There are many airlines now that charge for soda pop, but there was complimentary juice, coffee and tea during meal service, and a constant availability of complimentary water. I understand there is no personal entertainment on the seat, but remember it's economy - although I did hear the planes are being upgraded next year. I give the experience an A+. Only regret, the route is not available in May and there are no direct flights from Phoenix to Manchester!

### "do not recommend"
Not Verified |  Frankfurt to Baltimore. Had passengers board the shuttle bus and stand on the bus for 20 plus minutes in the heat with no air. The driver said the airline was short of cleaning staff and we had to wait to board the plane. After 15-20 min in the heat a passenger asked to at least open the doors for some air. The driver said in German not to exit the bus however it appeared the majority of passengers speak English and walked off the bus. This is a liability and safety risk. It is inhumane to have the passengers overheat on a bus. I’m addition the departure was delayed by about 45 minutes and there was no communication regarding the delay. Definitely will not be flying this airline again and  do not recommend.

### "a delayed departure"
Baltimore to Frankfurt. This is the worst airline I have flown. They made me sit in a non air conditioned room after messing up security check multiple times and then take a packed non ac bus to the airplane. Once there, you can’t get off the bus. Then when you do, you trek up a large stairway to sit on a hot plane. Next, a delayed departure of 1hr 20mins.

### "service was really bad"
Seattle to Frankfurt. My Condor experience was the first I ever had with an airline company. I bought tickets online using the flex option which allows up to three re-bookings. I had to change my flight and then had to call Condor. This was a nightmare. I spent almost 4 hours with the support team trying to change my ticket. I waited 30 min each time hanging on the phone before having someone actually answering me. They told me that I could only exchange my ticket to another ticket but by paying again the flex option (+80 $), which makes no sense, why couldn't I just have a regular ticket as I already paid the flex option once? Then they made some errors in the amount they took from by bank account and had to call them back so that they can correct their mistake. Once on the plane, the service was really bad, even if I'm used to low cost companies, this was the worst. Snacks were to small for a 11h flight and the entertainment service only proposed 2 movies for free (Avatar and Lego Batman). When I came back to the US I decided to take Icelandair, which is way better, for the same price! I strongly advise not to take Condor!

### "initial trip was canceled"
Frankfurt to Seattle. This review is posted on behalf of my 81 and 82 years old parents who flew with Condor round trip from Frankfurt to Seattle. Their initial trip was canceled after they showed up at the airport with no explanation and not compensation for the trouble. They had to come back the day after resulting in missing a precious day of vacation with their grand children. The return flight wasn't much better, they were put in an exit row seat which meant in front of the restroom, with no ability to extend their feet or recline their seats. In addition, the A/C was blasting cold and most passenger were wearing blankets around them. The crew didn't seem to care. Finally, the food was atrocious.

### "entire flight was a disaster"
Not Verified |  This entire flight was a disaster. We got off our plane from Kraków to transfer via Frankfurt, only to find that our plane to Minneapolis was delayed by 2 hours. That in and of itself was annoying, but I get that delays are unavoidable. Once they loaded all of us onto the plane, we proceeded to sit on the plane for an additional hour before the captain informed us that our plane was over the weight limit. There was no indication of how long it would take, but about another half hour later, we were in the air. The flight attendants announced that due to the inconvenience, everyone on the flight would be granted free access to premium entertainment. Except, we had already paid for it, and I still wasn’t able to access it. I signaled to get assistance from an attendant, but waited three hours before finally giving up and switching it back off. When drink and food service was administered, I attempted to alert the attendants to the issue, but was advised to wait longer. This was never fixed. About a half hour before we landed, the captain announced that “some” customers’ luggage was not placed upon our plane, and that if we noticed our luggage missing, we needed to fill out the form. Of course, after landing, my travel companion and I discovered that none of our luggage was on the carousel. We filled out the form as instructed, and were informed that our luggage “should” arrive by Tuesday night, and that we would be emailed reference numbers. I requested to be able to pick up my bag at the airport, because my trust that Condor could handle successfully delivering it to my home was lost. I was never emailed a reference number. I was neither emailed, nor called, nor texted any information about where my bag turned up to. Right now, I am on the second round of calling their U.S. 1-866 number, because the first time I called disconnected after 45 minutes. This is hands down the worst air travel I’ve ever experienced. All I want is my bag back.

### "terrible customer service"
Las Vegas to Frankfurt. I wish I actually had a flight to review but this review is about Customer Service (or total lack thereof). I was supposed to fly from Las Vegas to Frankfurt on Condor today. After I was not able to check in online and there was a strange flight from Munich to Frankfurt in my booking information, I decided to call. After being on on hold for nearly 30 minutes, I finally spoke to someone who informed me that my flight was cancelled and that I had been booked onto a Eurowings flight for tomorrow to Munich with connection to Frankfurt. No email, no phone call or any type of notification prior to that. They blamed the cancellation on the Las Vegas airport but I also saw that their flight from Frankfurt to Las Vegas was cancelled as well. I did call Eurowings and have a verbal confirmation that I am indeed booked on their flight but I have nothing in writing from Condor. I also spent over $100 changing my reservation from Reno to Las Vegas from today to tomorrow since I had no indication that anyone would be covering overnight expenses. I've flown a lot throughout my life but this takes the prize for terrible customer service, hands down. I can only wonder what my return flight from Frankfurt to Las Vegas will end up being like...

### "never fly with them again"
Dubai to Stuttgart. Terrible Airline, will never fly with them again. I understand, that Condor is a low-fare Airline, however I still expect a certain service for a long distance flight. A flight exceeding 5 hours is a long distance flight in my opinion (our flight duration was 6 hours). We knew, that the seating would be terrible in a low budget flight and therefore especially paid to have seats with extra legroom. When boarding however, we were asked by the stewardesses in a very unfriendly tone whether we have the receipt for our seats as other customers paid for the same seats. It is a disgrace, that one has to be treated that way just because they are not able to organize their seats. After showing our receipt everything was fine. I do not understand why there have to be 6 Stewardesses on a flight which offers no complimentary service. You have to pay for water and food. There is no entertainment system, apart from the screens in the middle of the aisle and they didn't even have blankets. What are the stewardesses paid to do on these flights? Our stewardesses went through the aisles two times during the flight and spent the other time in the resting area. Maybe if Condor would reduce their stewardesses and offer at least water and blankets. Definitely the first and last time. And i might add, that we fly 4 long distance flights a year (also with low budget airlines) and none has been as bad as this one. Obviously Condor doesn't care though, because I read the other reviews and all of them are terrible.

### "not be using Condor again"
Austin to Manchester via Frankfurt. First let me say I am not a frequent reviewer and I see far too many reviews based on 1 negative experience and some of those are exacerbated by the traveler's lack of preparation and knowledge. I've flown condor on 4 flights (2 round trips). The first was their inaugural flight from Austin to Frankfurt. I was excited to find a low fare airline was finally operating within 100 miles of me as I have used several in Europe over many years. Affordable Business Class would be great. The inaugural flight was long delayed by late arrival, jetway alignment, cleaning time, and disorganized loading. Fortunately I expected delays and scheduled my ongoing connection late enough that we did not miss it. On board service was great. My second trip two years later was still plagued with exactly the same problems - only this time exacerbated by what seems to be lack of competence. Late departure from AUS caused Condor to automatically rebook connecting flights be we got no text, email or notice from Business Class attendant that it happened. We were at our previously scheduled connecting flight in plenty of time and did not know anything until we were denied boarding. 6 hours in a closed Macdonalds, losing my rental car at destination, no help desk in the airport, no useable response from phone calls and no access to lounge was a bummer. I'll leave out some of the details of Inbound flight to Austin but suffice to say it was 2 hours late due to comedy of errors all due to a lack of coordination (one example buses to planes arrived just as they were starting to refuel so we're crammed onto buses for the entire refueling sequence). Priority" luggage arrived on belt 45 minutes after landing along with all the other luggage. If an hour sitting on a concrete floor (before buses) in a holding area sounds like Business Class to you by all means use Condor. This could be a good airline. On board service was just about as good as other Business Class carriers I've used. The staff are working hard but the system is just not functioning. My complaint and request for any type of voucher received a firm no. We will not be using Condor again.

### "never fly this airline again"
Seattle to Frankfurt. We arrived to the boarding gate for our flight in PDX, and were issued paper tickets (we had business class seats and could not check in online). When we went to board the plane we were told that our tickets were standby only, that 32 people had been booked on businessclass, but that the plane only had 16 seats. We were traveling with a family of 4 - two small children and two adults, an agent said they had 'a solution' and we were all rushed onto the plane separated into seats apart from each other. We had to ask other passengers to move so that our children were not seated with strangers. My child and I ended up in a row next to the toilets with seats that did not recline. Upon following the ridiculous customer complaint process (I even walked into their offices as our hotel was near them in frankfurt) this is the response I received: We regret to learn that you and your family could not be accommodated in the class of service you purchased for your flight DE2091 from Portland to Frankfurt, and offer our sincerest apology for any inconvenience that you experienced. Apparently because they got us there, they are going to stick with a sincere apology to make me whole?! I will never fly this airline again, and will be sure to warn everyone eager to try the new SEA - FRA route to beware. This is a budget airline without any sort of customer service integrity.

### "bad crew service"
Bad crew service going from Frankfurt to Fortaleza food was just dry pasta you have to pay to watch old movies - will never recomend this company. I have used lots of different companies but never this bad.

### "insulting and incompetent"
Seattle to Frankfurt. This airline is incompetent and insulting. We were unaware of the cost of adding a child under the age of two, so we had to add our child at the gate of the flight prior to boarding. The gate staff insisted on a cash amount of ten percent of the entire round trip ticket for the ticket, issued us no receipt, and all record of this is now lost on our return ticket. The service hotline has been insulting and incompetent. Despite the fact that my child was allowed onto the plane, they claim there is no proof of the payment occurring. We are now being required to pay the amount again. They have instructed us to contact the Seattle office of Condor, but they have no contact information for this office and the website and service line for SeaTac simply list the help hotline. Because they insisted on cash, we cannot show the electronic transaction. I will try to avoid this company in the future and I recommend other customers do the same.

### "was pleasantly surprised"
Baltimore to Frankfurt. I was really worried about taking Condor after reading terrible reviews, but was pleasantly surprised. Premium economy provided separate check-in, expedited security screening, and priority luggage handling. We did need to take a bus to/from the terminal in Frankfurt, which was a little disorganized. The seat wasn't terribly comfortable--but there was adequate legroom and decent enough recline to get some sleep. They provided a nice amenity kit with a re-usable tote. The food on the way over was terrible (tasteless pasta dish), but we seemed to have a separate premium menu on the way back, and the chicken dish was actually tasty, and another cold snack and yogurt were served later as well. Alcoholic beverages and soft drinks were included, as was the (limited) entertainment. On the flight back, service was very good, with numerous offers of drinks/water, and even a hot towel. Flight over was 1/2 hour late, and return flight left 1 hour late--we were not connecting, so not a problem for us.

### "Not an enjoyable flight"
New Orleans to Frankfurt. It did not land in time, which nearly caused me to miss my another flight. Not to mention the  quality of food they provide (pasta with bread), the plane was too hot. There was only one movie and one episode of a series to watch which are free. Not an enjoyable flight if you are flying for 10 hours.

### "extremely poor management"
We flew as a family with Condor (operated by Thomas Cook Balearics) from Hannover to Djerba and back. Both flights were delayed by two hours due to staffing problems. The information around the delays were very badly handled, both in Hannover as well as in Djerba. Looking at FlightRadar24, we could see how things evolved and knew more about developments than their local handling agents. The aircraft operating our return flight was coming from Hanover, where it had a scheduled turn-around-time of only 30 minutes from the previous flight from Heraklion. That this would not work was absolutely clear, even before a delay was announced. Later the crew explained, that a planned crew member was drawn to another flight and they had to wait for a standby staff. This is extremely poor management by Condor/Thomas Cook. The flight itself was also very poor. Even though they gave out a small drink for free due to the delay, once they reached us, only still water and tomato juice was left. There were no drinks for purchase (catering error). Luckily the duty free goods made it on board and so revenue could be earned for the company. Only positive aspect was the cabin crew, who tried to make best out of extremely poor management. Last thing to mention is, that also my previous four Condor flights were delayed, one even landed at the wrong airport, leading to a three hour bus journey in the middle of the night. Therefore I can clearly say: Condor/Thomas Cook Airlines never again!

### "worse than other cheap airlines"
Baltimore to Vienna via Frankfurt. I bought a ticket with this airline as a late option before travelling to Europe. I don't write many reviews and this is one of a few very negative ones but I hope it will help fellow travelers avoid my mistake. I have traveled on many airlines around the world over many years and Condor now officially rates as the worst airline I have ever traveled on. Just a few of the the many problems on this airline: (1) reserved an aisle exit row seat for 120 dollars - a necessity on long flights because of a medical condition. Was told at the airport that "someone had changed my reservation and the seat was no longer available" Instead I was given a 40 dollar seat that had less space than most domestic flights. No apologies, no refund offered. In fact, they wanted to change me an extra $40 for this new seat until I told them to go to hell, I had already paid. (2) claimed that the flight would be late taking off because they were cleaning it. Arrived so late that it was impossible for numerous passengers to make their connecting flight in Frankfurt. Re-booked my flight but didn't bother telling any of us on the flight, or texting or emailing us so we were left desperately trying to get to our connecting flights. Actually took over 45 minutes to go through security, passport control and the considerable distance between the arrival gate and the gates for the connecting flights. Again no apologies, no communication, (3) On the return flight, informed about the gate at the last moment - long after all the other airlines. The Condor flight left from a large barn like addition to the airport. By this time realized that the Condor gate would be asshole of the airport - clearly this is not an airline that garners much respect. The boarding gate was a massive chaotic mess, with no one knowing where they were supposed to go and no effort by employees to guide the huge jostling disorganized line - basically we were treated like cattle - or perhaps worse. (4) bring your own food - theirs is disgusting, your own entertainment - 2 movie channels, the toilets require basic maintenance. Yes this is a cheap airline but so much worse than all other cheap airlines and not very cheap if you upgrade to basic expectations. Summary: I would not travel on this airline unless you are absolutely desperate and have NO other options.

### "the most dreadful flight experience"
Traveling to Europe at least twice a year, I can say this is the most dreadful flight experience we have had. The seats in premium economy were like sitting on a wooden bench, so enjoyable for a 10 hour flight. We were served dinner on our breakfast tray. The purser, head of the flight attendants, was incompetent to deal with issues. Though we did have 2-3 flight attendants that were competent. The woman in front of me put her seat back and three glasses of liquid spilled into my lap. Poor design. We dreaded our return flight. Never again.

### "I have filed a complaint"
I had a flight from Austin at 21.50. I came to the Austin - Bergstrom airport two hours early to check in my bag and at the counter, by the register boy at Condor Airlines, I was informed that I do not have a flight for July 5th. He swiped my passport twice and showed us the screen, in which was stated that I had a flight for July 9th. I was misinformed at the airport about my booking and was not permitted onto my returning flight which I purchased 3 months ago. I had the invoices and the itinerary, which proved that I had a flight that day, but because of the system glitch, he could not check me into that day's flight due to the fact that according to the system there was no flight for me that day. As a consequence, I got stuck in Austin with no returning flight. He showed me on the screen that I have a flight Monday, but now after contacting the airport, airline and booking agents, it's apparent that I don't have a flight at all. My itinerary for the complete trip showed the correct departure date, including the systems of our booking agent, and the airline system. The only system that did not allow me to check-in and fly was the Condor Airlines registration desk at Austin Bergstrom International Airport. Like I mentioned before, the passport was swiped a couple of times, proving that I was in the airport and not late, nor absent. Due to the companies mistake in Austin, Texas on July 5th, I was not boarded on my flight from Austin to Frankfurt and onto my connecting flight from Frankfurt to Riga which has caused me 700 USD loss. Due to Condor mistake, I was forced to book an additional return flight Austin-Frankfurt-Riga and I requested to be paid back immediately for all the expenses I had to endure during their system failure to provide the check-in desk with my correct flight information. When I contacted the phone number they gave, because no one at the Check-in would help me, I was placed on hold for about an hour, and the next day informed that nothing can be done, as I was supposed to be on that flight. No one has offered any help or advice. I have filed a complaint, and hope to get an answer.

### "never fly Condor again"
I purchased an upgrade to premium class, days before flying due to a back problem. My upgrade cost 320€ and I feared after reading reviews that it was absolutely necessary, only to find that at the gate in Frankfurt airport, they were offering the upgraded seats for 80€. They ask you to be at the gate one hour before the flight, I suppose to sell these upgrades??? But then the attendant annouced that there was also ONE seat left on business for "sale". I approached him with the reciept of my upgrade and asked if he could give me the business class seat, seeing that I had paid 4 times the price of his "offer". He was not kind and did not listen to me, but told me that it was the "luck of the offers that are available at the gate" and that he couldn't possibly put me in that business class seat. I was seated in 6H, premium class which has leg room but is in front of the cabin crews ample and curtained seats. My moniter to watch entertainment was placed so high up that it was not comfortably reachable nor comfortable to watch! The other seats had foldable footrests, my seat did not. The flight attendant came into her seat, reclined far back which left me with a big curtain hanging in front of me, which took away any of the extra room of my seat. Also the food was awful and I believe that airline food isn't so bad and usually edible, this was not. I will never fly Condor again. For the return flight from Pittsburgh to Frankfurt, I asked about the price of the upgrade 225$ and asked if they were going to sell them last minute for much less and they assured me that they wouldn't, and they didn't. I sat in my economy class seat and suffered the size and limited entertainment for my return. Mostly the crew were nice but not helpful and always on the sell.

### "a horrible experience"
Frankfurt to Portland. It was a horrible experience. We had to pay for our seat. I want to seat with my mother who is sick they want me to pay for seats. The airplane was not ready to fly cause the air conditioner was broken but they asked everyone to get it. It was so hot inside it took about 1 hour and half to fixed. Anyways it was 1 hour delay there was a lot of people that they had connected flight and they missed it. Customer service was so poor; the flight attendants were so rude. I was so scared to ask for anything cause there next to my asked for blanket and the flight attendants with attitude told him he should get a blanket by himself. For 11 hours flight no intertainment if you have money you can buy headphones and code to unlock movies. I always fly to different countries and I have tried a lot of airlines but this one is the first time I heard to pay for movies and headphones. It was so boring sitting and not being able to watch movie for 10 to 11 hours fly. I could not wait to get off. It feels like I was in jail. Food was horrible When I was checking flight I put especial request for food vegetarian but they brought her meats and she couldn’t eat, my mother is diabetic and she needs to eat, I asked the flight attendants and show her the ticket and she had no idea. She said there is only one option for good. I asked her to bring anything they have and after 30 mind she brought her one apple. They did not bring any snacks we had one dinner and breakfast and it was so small amount. They don’t have a lot of drinks available either. I would never fly with this airline.

### "customer service is horrible"
Not Verified | Never fly on Condor, customer service is horrible. We sat on the plane for 2 hours last night to find out we couldn't take off. After getting off the plane we were told to go home if we could but that they might be able to find some hotel rooms. The employees at the desk had no answers for us and provided us with a phone number to call. After sitting on hold for 20 minutes the person on the line says they can't answer any questions we need to talk to the people at the airport and the hung up on me. We ended up at a hotel and were told to check the website for an update at 8am. At 8:22 the website was still stating that info. Around 8:30 it was updated to say next information 9:30. What's even better is the sign at the ticket counter. I call Condor again and they state I need to talk to the staff at the airport, what staff? He promised me someone would be there in 20 minutes. I asked if I could speak with the person confirming the arrival of the employee in 20 minutes and was hung up on. Condor is stated they can not assist with rebooking hotels, car rentals or connectong flights.

### "forced me to pay for the choice of seat"
Flew Las Vegas to Frankfurt. Two times Condor forced me to pay for the choice of seat. The first time after buying a ticket, the second time on check in. Money has not been returned. Did not receive any apologize.

### "never fly with Condor again"
The flight from Frankfurt to Las Vegas was delayed more than 9 hours. I went to check-in early enough to ensure I don't miss my flight as I had to be in Vegas at a certain time. The check-in desk in Frankfurt told me I need to go to the Service Desk of Condor in Frankfurt airport as they can check for re-scheduling possibilities. I went to the service-desk of Condor and asked for re-scheduling opportunities and I had checked instantly that there were several possible flights that they can re-book me, the lady there told me they won't do it for me. Even if I told them the urgency of my trip was to be in Las Vegas at a certain point of time and this delay was making the flight pointless, the response I got was: "there is nothing we can do". In contrary there were quite other flight possibilities which I even showed to her. But again the answer was no. What really hurt me the most was that a couple in front of me were on the same flight and they were offered alternative flight to make their appointment. I would never fly with Condor again and I would highly recommend to anyone not to chose Condor as an airline. Their customer service is unfair and disappointing.

### "canceled without notification"
Toronto to Frankfurt. My flight was canceled without notification and reason. I called Condor Customer service three times. Every time the wait time was 45min. I think they wait and pickup the phone after 45 min. Tried the online chat. Contradictory information provided by the two parties. The first one told me that the next available flight was in 5 days and booked my flight for June 1st. The online chat people told me that I am booked for the next day with Austrian Airlines but ware not able to give me any confirmation. I'm still not sure when I'm flying. Condor / Thomas Cook and their customer service are not yet ready for overseas flights

### "definitely fly with Condor again"
❌ Not Verified |  Toronto to Frankfurt. My husband and I had a very pleasant experience flying with Condor airlines from Toronto to Frankfurt. Having read all the bad reviews, we were concerned with the quality of the flight. However, most of the things I have to say are positive. The flights were on time, check-in very quick. The plane itself was pretty new and although there was not not a ton of legroom in the Ecomony seats, we felt pretty comfortable. The service was very good too, actually better than other companies we have flown with previously. The food was a bit hit or miss - the main meal was not good, but the lighter meal at the end of the flight was very good. So I would recommend taking a sandwich from home. Also in terms of entertainment, there were only 2 movies we could watch for free - the rest you could order for an additional fee. So again , just grab a book or a movie from home. They do have a huge audio selection though that is completely free and excellent. So overall, for the cheap price that we paid we were pleasantly surprised and will definitely fly with Condor again.

### "offer no free WiFi"
Seattle to Frankfurt. What a terrible experience. Rude cabin crew. I was looking at photos on my phone and a stewardess came and asked me to switch it off. I hit the power button and put it away but then she said to turn it completely off in a very rude tone. I complied even though I have not had to turn my phone completely off for many years now as long as it is on airplane mode. This is the first and will be my last time flying on Condor. They have a very sad selection of entertainment available on an international flight, and offer no free WiFi.

### "miss our connecting flights"
Tel Aviv to Portland via Frankfurt. Flight was delayed for three hours without any explanation, making me and other passengers miss our connecting flights. Once we got to the main destination their was no customer service or anyone to speak to at their desk to receive food vouchers, or any way to help switch flights.

### "on the same level as Ryanair"
I booked a Condor flight from Santa Cruz de La Palma to Düsseldorf for 18th April 2018 although I needed on one month earlier. This was completely my own mistake. Therefore, I called the customer service and asked for a cancellation of my flight (for a fee of 110€ ) as booking a new flight would be cheaper than using the flex option of my flight. Thus I told them to please cancel and I would book the new flight. Now here comes the great surprise. The price of my new flight changed from 69€ to 289€ when I tried to pay. Basically a second after telling them to cancel my first flight. Thus I called the customer service again, but they told me hard and fast that this is the so called dynamic pricing system and this could happen all the time. No, I won't be able to reverse my cancellation of my first flight and yes, either I pay the new price of 289€ or I won't have any flight. Great thanks! Booking the wrong flight was completely my own mistake, I do understand that. The rest of the story, however, is impudence and puts Condor on the same level as Ryanair.

### "the seats were not available"
Stuttgart to Dubai. Chargeable XXL seats were booked and paid months in advance. At check-in, the correct boarding passes were handed out. At the gate, my wife and I, as well as two other passengers, were called during boarding. There we were told - without giving reasons - that the seats were not available. Statement: "It would be like that. We should get in touch with the Condor flight service after the flight. After several minutes of discussion, we were let into the plane, with no clarity about where we ultimately sit. There we got the booked seats. During the flight it was freezing cold, without blankets, coffee and water had to be paid for.

### "It was a disappointment"
From Berlin I had an uneventful flight to Frankfurt on Lufthansa. On my arrival there I could not find on the display from which gate the Condor flight to Seattle was leaving. A friendly Lufthansa agent could not find any information on her computer. Another agent from a small airline then directed me to the C gates, a long walk, at least for an 80+ year old, to the other side of the large Frankfurt airport. I had to leave the previous security area and go through a second security check. When I arrived the entrance of the security area was crowded already and we had to wait until the security people had arrived (other security areas were not busy but they served several airlines). The security officers took some time before they were all assembled and I had to wait, seats were in rare supply. Because of the delayed security boarding of the plane was late although arrival in Seattle was on time. My business class seats were adequate but not comparable to other airlines. There was no USB plug. The food and the service was exemplary. On arrival I expected my "priority" marked luggage to arrive early. I did not, in fact it did not arrive at all. An agent then asked me to fill out a form, which I did including the number of the luggage slip (which subsequently I lost, the agent may have attached it to the form, I presume. It is now more than 24 hours later and I have not received a phone call or an e-mail notifying me if and when I can expect my luggage. An attempt to contact the airline failed: the explanation was temporary technical difficulties. As an 80+ year old I kept only the medication for one day and although not seriously handicapped the long walk in Frankfurt tested my stamina. A friend had flown on Condor in coach and told me about difficulties, which I hoped to avoid by flying Business class. It was a disappointment. I fly frequently to Europe from the United States but I will not do so again on Condor.

### "last flight on this airline"
Frankfurt to Fortaleza. My recent experience with Condor was one of the worst if not the worst. We were kept in the plane, on the runway, for six hours, with no drinks or food offered, other than water. The crew kept us mostly in the dark about what’s happening, which was very frustrating. Finally, the plane had to go back to the terminal because the crew exceeded their time limits. They put us up in an airport hotel and it took them 28 hours to arrange another crew and a plane. But they wouldn’t release our luggage for all that time so we were stuck without a change of underwear not toiletries nor other necessities that were packed in our bags. My last flight on this airline!

### "problem is in their customer service"
Portland to Split via Frankfurt. As far as the airplanes and service experience, Condor is just fine. No frills, but no real issues either. Our problem is in their customer service or issue resolution if things go wrong. Both directions of our flight we had problems - on the way there it was missing our connection and needing to be rebooked, and on the way back our connecting flight from Seattle to Portland (booked through Condor, the flight itself was on Alaska) had been cancelled 2 days before  and Condor had not notified us, or rebooked us. When we landed in Seattle and called they told us it wasn't their problem. We ended up, through discussion with the very helpful Alaska agents, booking a rental car and driving to Portland (it would have taken 4 x long to wait for the next available flight). We paid for this out of pocket. I submitted this on the Condor airlines customer service on 8/11, and didn't hear anything. I contacted them in early October, and did receive an apology, but was told they were working on it, there was nothing they could do (they said they don't have phone numbers or ways to contact those who handle issue resolution) but that I would hear back within 1 week. On 10/26 I contacted them again, and was told the only option was to file another complaint. I asked to speak to a manager, to have some resolution, and the very rude representative just told me there was nothing she can do. At this point we are out $400 for the rental car, and have received no compensation or communication from Condo.

### "never use Condor Airlines again"
Frankfurt to Vancouver. My experience with Condor Airlines was terrible and I will never fly this Airline again! While the price was right when I originally booked the flight on September 18th, when I arrived at the airport on October 3rd, 40 minutes before my flight because I had been delayed several hours in transit, the staff at the check-in counter was  awful, worse than any staff I have ever experienced of any airline in my 62 years of my life. The man there said smilingly  I could not board the flight because I arrived 40 minutes before the flights and not the required one hour. I explained my situation, that I had booked train tickets to be there 3 hours ahead but can of course not control who decides to end their life on that day across what train track and that this would impact trains for thousands of people. This man had absolutely no compassion or understanding for my situation and just told me with another great smile that my ticket was no no and void and I would have to purchase a new ticket all over again. He did not mention that a few hours later they would have another flight that flew to Victoria just a slightly different routing with a stopover in Seattle. It's clear that this man didn't care in the very slightest what would happen to me, of course the airline had my money and that is all that matters. My ticket was  non-refundable. I decided to drive in that very moment that I would never ever ever fly Condor again. Thankfully I had purchased the plane ticket with my Visa dish on a Day card which insurance flights for circumstances just like these. However going through an insurance claim is a huge effort and I had to stay overnight and Frankfurt and pay everything up front including the flights that I took the next day which was in fact the same flight. If I had not purchased the replacement flight through a credit cards that they would refund me all my extra expenses, the situation would have been far far worse. I have never before by any Airline I have ever used, experienced such a vast extent of unkindness and uncaring by check-in staff at the gate. A few years ago, in 2013, I had booked a flight with Iceland air and the same thing happened, accept a time arrived just twenty minutes before the scheduled departure. In fact, there were two of us getting to the gate 20 minutes before the flight left and both of us were accommodated simply because the staff cared and wanted us to have a good opinion of Icelandair and somehow they managed to get the luggage on the next flight, and had it brought to our  addresses in Iceland. Now that is customer service! I will never ever use Condor Airlines again.

### "was extremely stressful"
Medford to Warsaw via Portland and Frankfurt, returning from Warsaw to Seattle via Munich. I booked trip for myself, my husband and our 1 year old child via Condor Airlines call center in Germany on April 21, 2017. A confirmation/invoice was sent to me for the trip. On return when we arrived at 5am to Warsaw airport on June 21 we were told at the check in desk that we are not on the list of passengers from Warsaw to Munich and that we have flight booked only from Munich. It was extremely stressful to say the least! After being sent around between different desk clarks I had to purchase new tickets for $716 USD to get me and my family to Munich on the flight we were supposed to be on in the first place LO 351. After submitting a complaint, following up with numerous calls and emails I finally received an explanation of a supposed computer error and a check for $190 USD. You ask why $190 USD? Well, it's approximately what 716 PLN (Polish currency) amounts to in USD. So their agent did not pay attention and instead of reimbursing me $716 USD sent me a check for $190 USD. I emailed them back right away clarifying this mistake and requesting remaining $526 however nobody ever responded to me in the last 2 months. So, it's been nearly 4 months since our trip and I am yet to receive $526 USD or anything additional. This is unacceptable and what a shame for an airline that otherwise could do so well!

### "leaving the waiver zone"
Zagreb to Portland via Frankfurt. I booked a ticket directly with Condor on their website. Starting in Zagreb (first leg operated by Croatia Airlines) and going to Portland USA via Frankfurt. My only check in was in Zagreb and my documentation has been checked there by Croatia Airlines and I've been told that I am all clear and good to go, got printed a second boarding pass for Frankfurt - PDX flight and told to just go to the gate once in Frankfurt and that I don't have to talk to Condor staff or prove anything in Frankfurt since the ticket was bought as a one journey. Also my bags were supposed to go straight to PDX when I dropped them in Croatia. However I was asked to show documentation again at the boarding gate in Frankfurt 10 minutes before gate closes, only to find out I can't board the plane because my onward journey exiting USA was to Haiti and apparently that doesn't count as leaving the waiver zone. I was not aware about those fine print rules and regulations when I booked the flight, the only reminder was that I might be asked for a proof of onward journey at the check-in. It's obvious that they're doing that on purpose to make more money out of customers. Later on I tried to talk to one of their employees at the frankfurt airport only to find he was lacking professionalism and customer service skills. I had to rebook the ticket and sort myself out for 2 nights in Frankfurt. I flew with them couple times and they're getting worse - lately they started charging 12 euro for entertainment pack and wouldn't provide free headphones, so that's extra. Food and on-plane service has never been good.

### "the service was first class"
Flew Frankfurt to Toronto. Old planes, great service. I have to admit I was rather hesitant to fly Condor as I’m not a big fan of charters. But we were on a tight budget and we needed to go and there were no seat sales to be found for our dates. My main concern was space and charters tend to really cram the people in. My wife I booked premium economy (about a 1000€ cheaper than Lufthansa). I read all the reviews I could and kept seeing comments about 'old' planes. The Condor website gives you the impression that all the planes are new and Thomas Cook, the parent airline, has the new Boeing 787s. So it was a huge shock to get on board and find not only did they not have in seat TVs but they overhead TVs were from the 80s. I mean how to you even get parts for a 40 year old TV. I can’t believe they still work. Sure don’t build them like they used to. That aside the service was first class and the food, very surprisingly, was excellent! The seats while older were very comfortable. My main concern was leg room and premium economy gives you an extra 8 inches of much needed space. The staff made a huge effort to give 5 start service and like I mentioned the food really surprised me. The best I’ve had yet (next of course to Business Class). I noticed a lot of "the airline screwed up and I’ll never fly them again" comments. I suspect that when it comes time to book again and price will win. The flight back there was no empty seats, inspite of the bad reviews price always win. Will I fly them again. Probably, I’d prefer Luftansa Air Canada Business class but the budget doesn’t always allow it! Tip: don’t book business class as if they do switch planes you may get downgraded to premium economy. Do pay extra for the premium economy. If you must book back of the plane pay extra and get an emergency exit seat. It’s tight back there.

### "never flying with Condor again"
Flew Austin, Texas to Prague, Czech Republic. Back in March we bought tickets with Condor Flugdienst to fly to Europe. We decided to pay extra and upgrade to Premium Economy just so we could get a bassinet for our daughter of 7 months, so she could fly more comfortably. With Condor, bassinets are only available in certain specific Premium Class seats and must be booked together with the parent’s seat. Two months after buying our tickets Condor changed the airplanes for our flights and we received the following notification by email: “The operating aircraft on which you are due to travel changed and the alternative aircraft has a different seat configuration. Therefore we've moved you to the nearest comparable alternative with identical seat properties.” Except that that wasn’t true: my husband and I were given separate seats and I was assigned a seat without a baby bassinet. Meaning we would have to carry our daughter on our laps for 12+ hours, after we had already paid for a premium class ticket with a bassinet available. We called Condor ASAP because their online system is extremely limited and does not even allow changing seats. We spent 45+ minutes on hold and were almost starting to doubt if the constantly repeating message about how much Condor cared for my call was actually true. But finally we got to a real human being. We explained the problem and how the seat arrangements had gotten all messed up after the airplane change. No problem, he said, let’s get them back on track. He put my husband and me back in adjacent seats (even though we lost the window seats) and gave me a seat with a baby bassinet available. All is well, we thought, and things happen. Flying is a complicated business and we understand that sometimes airlines have to make rearrangements like changing aircraft. Could Condor have been done better? Perhaps, but nothing is perfect and in the end we got back what cared about the most. Fast forward to a week away from our trip, and we decided to call Condor to ask some routine questions and verify that everything was in order for our travel. We just wanted to make sure that all of our bases were covered since we were traveling with our baby daughter, it’s a long trip after all. And this is where the problems started. We asked Condor’s representative to confirm the seat arrangements for the departure and return flights and he told us that for the return flight there was no bassinet available. What? That has to be a mistake, because we called back in May and Condor’s representative fixed exactly that! Well, turns out that he didn’t do it for both flights, only for the outbound one, and completely failed to mention it back then. And now the one bassinet seat in the plane was taken. Now what? Well, according to Condor’s representative, we now had to take our daughter in our lap for 12+ hours because there was nothing that they could do. Nothing. Well, what can we do? There’s nothing we can do.” This is obviously Condor’s fault, there has to be something that can be done to fix this. There’s nothing we can do.” In conclusion: Needless to say, we will be voting with our wallet (extra 1000$ for a seat for my daughter)and never flying with Condor again. I’d rather pay extra and fly with an airline that would not take advantage of us in such a blatant way, and they used my daughter as the wedge to force us to pay up. Condor would rather lose a customer for life than own up to their mistakes.

### "staff was friendly and helpful"
Not the best experience. The aircraft was old. There was absolutely zero inflight entertainment, no charging outlets. Food was mediocre and was very rich on mayonnaise. Soft drinks were served multiple times during the flight, as well as alcoholic drinks with meals. Staff was friendly and helpful. I would fly with them again.

### "cannot recommend to fly Condor "
Frankfurt to Minneapolis. Premium Economy bad service Condor gave the possibility to upgrade flight tickets to Premium Economy for EUR 99.- each. They told us we will get better food, free drinks and better service. Because we had a long flight in front of us we paid for the upgrade, expecting to have a better service. During the flight they only served food and drinks during the normal serving times. I called for a flight attendant to get some water and no one showed up for over 2 hours. I had to wait until next food was served. I wrote to Condor to tell them my experience and they only told me that beverages are available during normal meal service and between it can be that they were busy. I have not seen one flight attendant walking up and down the aisle for over 2 hours. This was the worst service ever and I cannot recommend to fly with Condor or to pay an upgrade for Premium. Also the customer service is only finding excuses and did not apologize once .

### "superb value and good service"
We traveled out of Dallas to Vienna, and Condor carried us from Portland to Frankfurt. The short flights were coach by Alaska and Lufthansa and the trans-Atlantic segment was business class by Condor. Condor business class was much better than US-based airlines in terms of the willingness of the flight attendants to serve. They never stopped serving us food, drink, and wine. The did not disappear after serving dinner like American flight attendants. Yes, its movie selection is scanty (albeit tasteful), and its seats may be a bit too narrow for westerners, but it gets you over the ocean in comfort and on time. We appreciated the attitude of the crew - they worked hard to earn our trust, unlike American flight attendants whose sole interest in to collect a paycheck and benefits. For half the price of US-based airlines, Condor offered a superb value, and a good service. BTW, there were power plugs, headphones, small but good selection of movies and music, and plenty of good good, bread, fruits, and drinks (wine and German beer).

### "lack of communication"
Budapest to Seattle via Frankfurt. The worst flight ever, started seemingly normal. 30 minutes until the flight started experiencing some of the worse turbulence I had flown through. 2 hours into the flight we noticed our plane on the screen map had turned around, when the crew was asked they said the pilot will make an announcement. 10 minutes later we were told we are told there is a hydraulic fluid leak and we must return to Frnkfurt. We were told once we returned we would get a new plane and be on our way again. Before landing we received news that we would be staying over night, when we finally landed we had emergency crews surrounding the plane and for 20 mins it seems we were stuck inside the plane. From there the communication was absolute and no one was helpful. Did get a room , but ended up flying with the same crew the next morning. They told us to contact Condor for reimbursement of anything that was a fault of this, but I am reading I will never get refunded for anything. Old planes, dirty, lack of communication, and not really cheap tickets. Plus, the cabin crew did great keeping people calm and tried hard to take care of us on our final trip home .

### "no in-flight entertainment"
Toronto to Frankfurt with Condor Airlines. I have travelled them before, and at that time my experience wasn't that bad, but wasn't good either. This time I realized that it is the last time that I am travelling with this airline. The aircraft was old. There was absolutely no in-flight entertainment, no power outlets, no room for legs. I felt very bad during the flight.

### "absolute disaster"
Absolute disaster. San Diego to Frankfurt with a Seattle connection on Condor. I reserved and paid for a window seat but at the gate I found out they gave my seat to someone else. So I had to upgrade to premium to get a window seat and pay an additional $109! Then I land in Frankfurt and turns out to be my luggage is still in Seattle where I had my connection. I am here for a business trip and left with no clothes, laptop or cosmetic supplies. Who knows when they are going to deliver my luggage. I'll never fly with them again it's a nightmare!

### "Absolute worst airline"
Baltimore to Zagreb via Frankfurt. Absolute worst airline I have ever experienced in my life. The seating was cringingly bad. Food was mediocre (anything better you had to pay for and their credit card payment system was down so I couldn't buy anything). Legroom was dismal. TV's and entertainment were horrible. Staff was rude. Bathroom facilities didn't have paper towels available. I could go on but I would rather not re-live the experience. I would give this a zero if Skytrax would let me.

### "They lost my luggage"
New Orleans to Naples via Frankfurt. Worst experience ever. They lost my luggage and were zero helpful in trying to figure out if it's just delayed or lost and whatever else may have happened. No customer service number to speak to anyone in person. Blame the airport and take no responsibility for what goes into their planes. Apparently they have no tracking numbers for what luggage is added to their planes. So couldn't even tell me what leg of my trip they had my luggage and which they didn't. Wish I never flew with them. Ended up in Italy with no clothes, no hair or skin products.

### "Never again with Condor"
Cancun to Frankfurt. Check in prompt, efficient and courteous. Boarding chaotic with the last few rows called after business class and then no more announcements with rows etc. except final boarding call. Boarding was unorganised and tedious as a result. Purser and one flight attendant onboard very friendly, courteous and professional, the other 4 ladies seemed unfriendly, hurried, unmotivated and not really interested at all. When my 6 year old son suddenly needed to urgently use the restrooms during the meal service I was mortified at how rude one particular FA was to us both. During the night one had to go to the galley and interrupt the idle gossip to get a glass of water. Half an hour before breakfast I had a dry throat and went again to the galley for water (that most airlines continually offer). The young lady was clearly annoyed with my request and commented that she would be serving breakfast and drinks shortly anyway. Premium entertainment was poor and costed extra in a long haul. Food was poor. Never again with Condor. They aren't really much cheaper as the premium carriers when one factors in all the additional cost with seat reservation, drinks and snacks and entertainment/headphones.

### "no support from Condor"
Seattle to Frankfurt. First flight was delayed 10 hours, there was no support from Condor. They do not have employees at the Seattle airport, there was no information, no rebooking, zero help. After finally arriving in Frankfurt at 10:30pm the Condor office was closed, no employee arrived at the gate to direct passengers. We stayed in a hotel at the airport and stood in line at the condor desk the next morning to rebook our connection flight to find out they had booked us on a 7am flight without telling us, we missed it. Finally arrived at destination 24 hours past the scheduled time - without luggage. We are at the Frankfurt airport now, Condor flight is delayed by two hours, we will miss our connecting flight again. Condor employees cannot help us until we land in the USA. We most likely will not be able to get home today.

### "do not open check in early enough "
Munich to Las Vegas. I arrived at the airport 2.30 hours in advance of departure time, to find out Condor had no check in desks open for economy class. A long queue started forming, with confused passengers not understanding what was going on. About 1.30 hours before departure one Condor employee showed up and started to check people in. It took another 20 minutes before two more employee showed up and finally allowed the queue to progress. When I arrived at the check in desk I was told that I would not need to pick up my luggage in Las Vegas and that it would be automatically sent to my final destination (San Francisco). This was very strange and I asked for confirmation, which the employee was happy to provide. No need to pick up luggage in Vegas. By the time I checked in it was only 1 hours before the flight, and I had to go through security and passport control. In the corridor in front of the gate two Condor employees started checking everyone's documents again. A confusion of passengers directed to different flights (there were a number of people going to Seattle on a later flight also instructed to join the same queue) did not help. Instead of opening a new queue, they just kept shouting 'Las Vegas please come forward'. Onboard the pilot informed us the flight was going to be delayed because 25 passengers who checked in did not reach the gate in time. Further delay was caused by the need to removed their luggage from the hold. Arrived in Vegas my luggage was waiting for me at luggage reclaim. I had to re-check it to final destination. The inflight entertainment in economy class is limited to 2 movies (pay more if you want to watch something else) and the food was disappointing. This would have not surprised me, given the budget nature of the airline. But blaming the passengers for missing a flight when they do not open check in desks early enough was too much even for a fan of cheap flying like myself.

### "The pricing is good"
Baltimore to Frankfurt. I have flown this route on Condor/Thomas Cook 3 times now with another trip planned at the end of the month. This is one of the few direct flights from Baltimore to Europe. I have also recently flown this route on United from Dulles before. I live 15 minutes from BWI and an Hour and a half from Dulles. BWI's international terminal is very small only 8 gates, only one bar/restaurant once you get through security. On the return Customs delays can be very long if more than one flight comes in at a time. Of the 5 flights I have had on this exact route from Condor 2 have been on time, 3 have been late over an hour with tarmac delays which turn your 8 hours on the airplane into 10. The pricing is good especially if you are flexible and usually the premium economy is only 30 to 100 dollars more which is a great value for the extra legroom and premium food which I find to be excellent. Entertainment is pretty much zero as there are no tvs in the setbacks only old tube tvs showing ok movies. I actually watched a few of them out of boredom. No wifi on the flight. Cabin service has ranged from awesome to average depending on the crew. In summary if you are closer to BWI then Dulles and don't care about inflight entertainment then this works great for going to Europe. You will get there in one piece directly in 8 to 10 hours and not be hungry for about 2/3rds the price of United without having to deal with Dulles Airport. If they had wifi it would be a perfect experience for me as that would be all the entertainment I would need.

### "because they were freezing"
Frankfurt to Seattle. Condor was the only airline occupying the terminal with only two gates and still they managed to screw up the boarding cards/check-in properly. None of the ground personal made any attempts to clear up the situation. After the boarding completed and we rolled to the runway the AC was running on maximum setting for 11 hours, which turned the aircraft into a flying cooling house. None of the flight attendents noticed that some of the passengers had put on jackets and asked for blankets because they were freezing.

### "Don't take Condor Business Class"
Las Vegas to Munich. Don't take Condor Business Class. If you are considering booking a long-haul flight with Condor in Business Class - don't do it. Condors service is not what you would expect from Business Class. My Condor flight was delayed from Las Vegas to Munich for more than an hour so I missed my connecting flight with Lufthansa to Nürnberg. I fly very regularly Business long-haul flights (Senator with Lufthansa) but don't remember the last one (long-haul) being late, I fly with Condor once and the flight is delayed. Ok, might be bad luck. The way Condor handled it was bad though: Since it was our first wedding anniversary, it was important to me to get as quickly as possible back and I indicated that to the AHS agent handling Condors Customer Service at Munich Airport after collecting my luggage and having to walk through half the airport. Next Flight would have been around 7pm, thus not an option. I expected Condor would pay for a taxi to Nürnberg (about 150km from Munich Airport). Condor turned my request down and instead offered me a first class train ticket, which isn't that much cheaper but it meant I had to take the metro (S-Bahn) to Munich Central Station (about 45min), wait there and then take the train to Nürnberg, take a taxi home from train station, thus about 2h more than by taxi and about 4h later than with the regular flight. I am used to much better service in Business Class with other airlines considering the price I pay, so my advise: Don't take Condor Business Class!

### "No PTV screens"
Baltimore to Frankfurt. Plane was late for almost 2 hours and the plane looks ancient. No PTV screens in the seats. And that's the same thing in premium class so no difference which one you pick. On top of that they only showed one movie and it was a cartoon at 1 am. Seats are uncomfortable. Little Leg room. Food was ok but there was no choice. You can get free coke water tea and a beer but no other alcohol. Staff was so so. If you don't mind those things and pay cheaper price then go for it.

### "never fly with Condor again"
Vancouver to Frankfurt. Staff was friendly, but you had to pay for movies, unacceptable for such a long flight. Poor food and you have to pay for extra drinks and alcoholic drinks. Only 6 kilos of hand luggage is permitted. We had two bags to check in and had to pay 150 CAD dollars extra due to being over the allowance. I will never fly with Condor again.

### "only serves one food option"
San Diego to Frankfurt. The seat comfort is close to zero. Although I am 5"4 the space around you is very limited. No side neck supports and blanket & pillow only by request. Condor's customer service is inefficient in serving their food or beverages. Most of the crew on my both flights had an attitude, if you asked for any additional request. Condor only serves one food option, no matter if you are a vegetarian or not. You are more than welcome to order upfront another meal. Although the price of the flight costs the same when flying with BA, you have to pay to watch movies or alcoholic beverages - the movie selection does not list the newest movies either. Lastly you can only assign a seat, if you pay 30 EUR during the booking process.

### "do not recommend Condor"
Missoula to Frankfurt via Seattle with Condor Airlines. They cancelled my connecting flight and assigned me a different flight which meant I had an overnight stop. They did not offer me any hotel voucher or any food voucher, nor did they offer to change the flight to a better time or to help me in any way. Instead, I was forced to cancel the flight and rebook, meaning that I paid an extra 200 dollars through no fault of my own. I do not recommend Condor Airlines.

### "frustrated with nobody to help"
This is the very first time we flew Condor Airlines internationally , to Europe. We booked a 3 tickets Business class for our Outbound from San Jose to Athens via Frankfurt through Momondo web site. The reason I selected Condor was because it allow me to fly outbound with Business class and Inbound with Premium Coach. Seattle to Frankfurt to Athens (2 hrs layover), Condor did not allow us to check-in online 24 hrs ahead of the flying time and each time we have a lay over, we have to physically check-in at their counters. We flew Business class and I did submit their requested API 1 month ahead of time. Condor did not explained nor have any agent helping us at any of the layover airports. Their agents showed up only 2 hours ahead of the connecting fly at their counters. We are frustrated with not knowing what to do at the lay over airports since we have to go through security overtime. It was a waste of time and very frustrated with nobody to help. We booked Business class seats but from San Jose to Seattle we have to fly Coach with Alaska airlines (Condor affiliates partner) and Alaska only provides boarding pass at the last minute (even though we were at the airport 2 hours ahead of our fly) until Alaska is sure that every of their seats are with their customers. Every time, I called Condor customer services for help, Condor agents was no help. We bought Business class tickets assuming to have a priority check-in but at Seattle it was a bit chaos cause everyone wants to get in first. It was a nightmare for the 3 of us although we have been traveling abroad frequently and know the way around the airport. The Business seats of Condor Boeing 767 to me is compared to Premium coach seat. The food in the Business cabin is great, food in the Premium coach is horrible. In Athens 24 hours before our fly back to the state, I tried to check-in for our boarding pass, I was allowed only for myself the boarding pass but only from Frankfurt to San Diego, Condor blocked my wife and son printing their boarding pass and when I called Condor representative in Athens for help, they have no clue of how to fix this. We ended up getting to the airport 3 hours ahead of time to find Condor counter for help. The same process occurred again, we have to check-in every time we have a connecting fly on the way back.

### "food absolutely horrible"
Halifax to Zagreb via Munich. Staff friendly, price was right, food absolutely horrible! 3rd time flying Condor - also 2009 and 2012. My, how times have changed! The quality of service was still the same (average to very good), but no more free drinks, entertainment or decent food. Perhaps paying for (and ordering a meal) in advance is better? The main course pasta dish was melded to the inside of the container - formula and inedible. The breakfast bun was disgusting.

### "not fly with Condor again"
Toronto to Linz via Frankfurt. I knew it's a cheap airline so I didn't expect much, they will ask you to pay for earplugs, an instant upgrade to premium economy and etc. But for the movies, they only have 2 that are free and old, you need to pay extra for some premium selection, which I browsed. The seats are very narrow. For food, they have no choice, just pasta. The worse part was the ground crew, I got yelled at by the lady at the Frankfurt airport gate. I was flying from Linz to Frankfurt for connecting to Toronto and when I was in Linz, I used my mobile boarding pass alright, which I got by online check-in and it generated 2 boarding passes at once. So when I was at the Frankfurt gate, there was a weird instructions that asked the passengers to all "check-in" again with their passports, not to mention that the gate opened only 1 hr before the suggested boarding time. So I lined up for the re-check-in and got yelled at by the crew because I presented my mobile boarding pass. I got confused because I obtained it from the online check-in, then I don't know what intrigued her, she raised her voice. To be fair, the cabin crew were quite nice, with big smiles and were very polite. But overall, I will not fly with Condor again, mainly because of their poor service, and the horrible experience from the ground crew.

### "experience was positive"
Due to the number of poor Condor reviews, I was hesitant to book my trip. But the direct flights from my Austin home to Frankfurt as a hub to visit family in Germany and Spain persuaded me to try Condor for a business trip. The experience was positive, comparable and in some cases superior to Economy Premium in my other airlines - American, United and Delta. Food choices were welcome, although wine offering was a small glass with no refills. Staff was pleasant and encourages (and genuinely expresses thanks for) passenger donations to an African village school children. To compensate for the thin seat cushion (for the 10 hour flight), I sat on the soft pillow provided. My sense is that Condor and staff are working hard to improve their image and they succeeded in my trip.

### "definitely fly again"
Minneapolis to Frankfurt. Absolutely amazing! Great seats, clean aircraft, awesome food (so much of it we couldn't eat it all) and the service was impeccable. We travelled with our 6 month old baby and all the staff couldn't have been anymore helpful. Will definitely fly again.

### "the only problem is the waiting"
Flew from Las Vegas to Frankfurt. Condor is cheap and reasonable in terms of most of its services and baggage allowances. The hot food is good, and you always have free water. The pilot and staff are pretty nice. The only problem is the waiting. We had a 2-hour delay because we first had engine problems. Then during take-off, a kid refused to buckle up and they had to escort the family off the plane. The staff had to sort through and find all their luggage, causing many of us to miss connecting flights. If anyone from the Condor company reads this, I recommend that they warn passengers that they will be escorted off the plane for failing to follow pre-flight procedures.

### "cheap ticket, excellent service"
Cheap ticket from Frankfurt to Baltimore with Condor, excellent cabin service, no problems. The team served in the cabin were young, yet extremely polite and helpful. I flew May this year to Germany, returned June and the service I received was the the best ever for me (I am 66 years old and flew many times before). Whether a coincidence or the standard, this experience is going to make me search for Condor Airlines for my future trips. Entertainment (movies) and seat-comfort may not have been the best, but everything else took first place in my experience.

### "we were too late"
Seattle to Frankfurt return. Condor did not accommodate online check in and after changing our flight to depart 2 hours earlier, they sent an email which we missed. We were 75 minutes early to Frankfurt airport, and they could not issue boarding passes as we were too late, and they would put us on another flight without us paying a new one-way airfare. We have been fighting Condor for a refund of the replacement inbound airfare ever since but to no avail.

### "pretty uncomfortable"
❎ Unverified |  The plane was modern, new and exceptionally clean The ground crew both in Portland and Frankfurt were friendly and helpful. We were greeted with a complimentary pillow and blanket and a bottle of water in each seat. The food was decent for airline food and the flight attendants passed through the cabin often with offers of water and other drinks. The entertainment channels, we paid for the upgrade, were marginal with not much selection. The seats were really, really, cramped and uncomfortable. There was so little space in between the rows that it was actually hard to stand up and get out of the row. This made for a pretty uncomfortable over 10 hr flight. The price was right.

### "experience absolutely horrible"
Vancouver to Zagreb via Frankfurt. My first Condor experience has been absolutely horrible. Economy class is despicable on this airline with absolutely no leg room for the 10 hour flight from Vancouver to Frankfurt. The food they provide in economy was disgusting and mainly consisted of bread. In comparison to other airlines the Condor economy class is deplorable and definitely not worth your time or money.

### "A total mess"
Flight from Munich - Varadero: First the flight was overbooked and the ground staff did not provide any information in English. Then they said a technical problem happened and delayed the flight around 3 hours. They did not provide any help! No voucher, no WiFi, no call. They ask to double check boarding passes several times. The new aircraft they brought in had a different seat configuration so, boarding was a mess. Tickets did not match and there were several people with the same seat. A total mess! Around 6 hours total delay. In all that time they just provided a snicker (chocolate) and a bottle of water.

### "her reaction was inappropriate"
Calgary to Frankfurt with Condor Airlines. I boarded the plane with a baby and I mentioned to our flight attendant that I was an ex-flight attendant, (Sabena) as per protocol. When I told the flight attendant I needed help with the seat belt to attach my baby on my lap she responded to me that if I was a flight attendant I should know how to buckle the belt. I just needed help to reach the seat belt lock and her reaction was inappropriate due to the circumstances. I was very disappointed at her remark and thought to myself as a flight attendant I always had a positive attitude towards passengers. Today, I'm glad I'm not part of these companies as I live in a much better part of the world.

### "don't even try this airline"
Cancun to Prague via Frankfurt. The worst experience with Condor. Dirty seats, red wine from previous flight everywhere, rude and unpleasant flight crew who did not appologize for that. Screen does not work so my wife can not watch any films, dirty plane including the awful toilets. We booked business class - first journey by Condor and next by Czech Airlines. CSA did not provided business class lounge access, when I tried to solve it in Frankfurt by telephone, the operator from Condor checked our booking and told us that we need to pick up a voucher from the Condor desk for the lounge. So we travelled through the whole airport to the Condor desk where we were told we do not have business class lounge access. Don't even try this airline - better pay more for Lufthansa, Finnair, Emirates or another normal business class operator who knows how to behave to business class passangers.

### "the crew and staff are lazy"
Flew Condor Airlines from Munich to Barbados. This is the worst experience I have had with any airline that I have flown with. Economy class consisted of charges that no other airline would ever charge. The crew and staff are lazy and delays should be expected as a norm. Even as a cheaper alternative to other airlines this was by far the worst investment for airfare that I have made. Please avoid.

### "this airline is not reliable"
Flew Condor Airlines from Frankfurt to Seattle. This airline is beyond appalling. From significant, unexplained delayed each way to poor customer service inflight this airline is not reliable. The ground crews in Seattle and Frankfurt created chaos. Extremely unprofessional and incompetent staff. I will never fly again. Pay a little extra and fly on a reliable airline.

### "economy is very uncomfortable"
Toronto to Prague via Frankfurt. Gates for connecting flights at Frankfurt are posted at the last possible minute. In our case D2 was posted until just before the flight then changed to D23 at the last minute not allowing enough time to reach the gate. We missed our flight and had to bus it to Prague causing an 11 hour delay. Tip: don't trust the flight boards, use a mobile app to track your gate. Get to the gate as soon as possible to get in line for the final passport check, don't stop to shop! If they offer deals at the gate for premium economy take it. Economy is very uncomfortable on long flights.

### "never fly Condor again"
Cape Town to Frankfurt. Unfortunately a very poor experience. Checking in luggage over one hour at Frankfurt, with passengers almost rioting. No one behind desk, no manager to be seen. Staff sicknesses blamed - poor single girl checking in next day flights (why) there on phone seeking help in tears. Comfort during flight impossible if over 1.85 metres plane - seats crammed to maximise revenues. Food abysmal. Booked train ticket in association with flight - even that failed on return with collection numbers wrong. Thomas Cook need to urgently look at threat to brand. Will never fly Condor again and advise others to avoid.

### "crew gave excellent service"
First time with Condor through Thomas Cook. Manchester to Fuerteventura (4th October) and return (18th October). Plane was obviously fairly new. Plenty of leg room and good seats. Flights bang on time. Flight crew gave excellent service and pilots were very informative for a change. Food good. It had the best inflight graphics I have ever seen showing the route information. It had satellite views of the land and gave various views of the plane. Full plane shot, wing shot and a pilots view out of the windscreen. Would travel with them again.

### "do not fly with Condor"
We flew with Condor from Frankfurt to Seattle and back. The reason was not the price (which was not distinctively lower than other airlines), it just came up as the best option in terms of time spent on the whole way. So what you are getting for basically the same price as with other airlines is the following: Smaller space on your seat and around, poor food all the time, 2 movies provided for free, but no headphones for free, if you want anything else to eat beside the 2 meals provided you need to pay for that. Dirty toilets that were not cleaned during the whole flight and last but not least-rude staff. They treat the customers like a cattle, without any exception on neither of those 2 flights. If you have any self-respect do not fly with Condor.

### "bad customer service"
Second time we had to fly by Condor Airlines from Costa Rica to Frankfurt via Santa Domingo. There was no other choice because of necessity of US transit visas for flights via USA, that we did not get. While the prices are getting higher there is a very bad customer service. I contacted Condor beforehand via email for Costa Rica $29 for 1 person airport exit tax and had got the answer "We inform you that all the airport taxes and fees are included in the ticket price". In airport it was 1 hour usual flight delay, and Condor representative insisted us to pay Costa Rica exit tax extra. Poor service onboard, plastic meal as well for ordinary ticket. Our neighbour lady passenger sitting next to us, had ordered special menu for extra price, so she had problems to get it.

### "Service was terrible"
We were booked on Condor Flight DE2403 from Toronto to Frankfurt, as the middle flight on a three flight booking. When we arrived to check-in for our first flight in Montreal on WestJet, our bags were checked only to Frankfurt. We assumed this was because we had to clear customs before catching our next flight, however when we only received boarding passes to Frankfurt as well, we were concerned. However the Westjet agent said he simply had 'no ability' to check us through to our final destination of Zurich. When we arrived in Toronto, we waited at the Condor gate until 30 minutes after the flight was meant to depart. All of this time the monitors only said 'delayed' and there was no Condor agent present. Finally we gave up and exited the gate area to go out to the main check-in area of the Airport only to find out that the flight had been 'delayed' until the next day. We requested re-booking but were refused. We requested that we be booked back to Montreal but this request was also refused. We were put up in a hotel however the entire process was poorly executed. When we arrived back at the airport by bus the next day, the check-in line at Condor was 1.5 hours long. The flight itself was okay and when we arrived in Frankfurt a Condor agent gave us the gate # for our new connecting flight as we still had no boarding pass). Unfortunately however, we were not able to travel back through to the gate area from customs with no boarding pass! Thus we had to enter the Main Terminal and find Luftansa check-in, only to be told our e-tickets were nullified. We then found a Thomas Cook service desk (in another terminal) and waited for over an hour to then be re-booked on another Lufthansa flight for which we still had to check-in with Lufthansa 'with our luggage' even though we had been assured in Toronto that our luggage would be checked through to Zurich. Retrieving our luggage was a nightmare, but we finally made it back to Lufthansa check-in, now 3 hours later. By this time however, there was a huge line and we would have surely missed our flight were it not for a kind Lufthansa customer service person who took pity on us and checked us in at an empty counter. Total delay - 24 hours. Service was terrible (except for Lufthansa staff,  who were excellent).

### "ground organization unbelievable"
Frankfurt to Toronto. The cabin crew for our Condor flight was fine but the ground organization was unbelievable. Two hours into our flight from Frankfurt to Toronto, the captain announced we were turning back because of a computer problem. We would be advised further when we landed. When we land 2.5 hours later, the ground crew is unprepared. In a highly disorganized fashion, one person gives us instructions to go somewhere else in the terminal. This takes a while because she gets into conversations with individuals. Most of us get lost going to the new location (this is a big airport, it was far away and the directions were unclear) but eventually we find it only to encounter one person who isn't expecting us. After she makes some calls she tells us to catch a shuttle to a nearby hotel. When we get to the hotel, they tell us we are in the wrong place and to take the shuttle back to the airport. When we get back to the airport, we have no idea what to do but we eventually find a Condor service desk and are escorted to the bus parking lot. We are there informed that we will be bussed to a hotel 180 kilometres which will take 2 hours. From landing to getting to the bus has taken 2 hours! Naturally, we now have to wait for everyone else to find their way to the buses which takes another hour. So the time from landing to the hotel has taken 5 hours! How hard would it have been for Condor to have someone escort us from the arrivals gate to the buses? After all, they knew we were coming and had several hours to prepare! A word of apology would have been nice too. Surely this was not the first time a flight has had to turn around.

### "departure time was modified"
I booked my flights direct from Brussels to Burgas and return in January 2016. The departure time was modified several times till June 2016 + change from Burgas to Brussels via Varna, but we were informed for the most recent change for more than 3 hrs delay of depature time from Burgas just before check in on 8/09/2016. So we have to stay from 19:00 till 01:10 on the airport and the flight to Brussels via Varna all night without sleep. It was very uncofortable combining with some health issues.

### "the service was sublime"
Frankfurt to Las Vegas. Check-in at FRA was a breeze at dedicated Business Class counter. Onboard, the service was sublime - non-stop attention and friendliness for 12 hours. The lie-flat seats were arranged in a 2-2-2 configuration and, while comfortable, did require some acrobatics to access the aisle if one has a window seat and your neighbor is fully reclined. The real highlight of this trip was the meal service: wonderful taste, elegant presentation, and substantial portions. IFE was great with a large seat-back screen, though the selection of movies is not as vast as on other carriers. This is my second Frankfurt-Las Vegas Business Class trip on Condor's non-stop service, and it ranks "up there" with the majors. My only negative is that the shared Lufthansa lounge at Frankfurt gate C14 was a bit of a disappointment.

### "try not to fly them again"
Calgary to Frankfurt. Old looking outdated cabin. Lowest customer service ever. Seats cramped together to the extent that is almost impossible for 6.2 ft, 250 lbs person to fit in one of their economy seats. Expect to pay 8 euro for "premium" in-flight entertainment that by the way is not premium at all, some outdated older movies. Free in-flight entertainment consisted of one older (2012) kids movie and one older regular movie. Food is on a brink of being disgusting. I expected way more from a German leisure airline. I will try not to fly with them again.

### "seats were really uncomfortable"
We flew with Condor from Milan to Varadero, with a change in Frankfurt this August. 10hr trip from Frankfurt to Varadero. The airplane was from the 80's (to be generous). There were only little ceiling monitors for the whole plane. However the company offers possibility to pay 8€ extra to have a portable tv (very old and heavy) with few movies and series on it, unfortunately there were not enough tvs for all the people on the plane and being at the half of the airplane we could only buy one in 3, which happened to be the last one available. The seats were really uncomfortable, and it was impossible to sleep. It was impossible to lay back the seat without hurting the person sitting behind. On top of this, the seat on front of mine was broken. The food was the lowest quality I have tried on a plane and the portions very small even for me. On the return flight the company moved us to another flight (Frankfurt-Milan) claiming that we couldn't make it on time for our original flight. Of course we discovered it only in Frankfurt, and even though we were at FRA check in 1hr 10 mins before departure, they refused to muve us back on our flight. Therefore we had to wait 6hrs in  Frankfurt after spending the night without sleeping due to their unconfortable seats.

### "terrible customer service"
Austin to Frankfurt via Venice with Condor. Entire flight cancelled with no notification. Then told that the passengers will be put up in a hotel, but the catch is that if you live in the Austin Area or less 50 miles (or 80 km) away you are turned away from getting a hotel. Now family must take time off from work to provide a ride to catch the rescheduled flight at 1355hrs the next day, which is during the middle of the work day. Not to mention there has not been a new issued itinerary, to coordinate getting picked up. Called and asked at the counter for a new itinerary and was told they did not know if there was one to issue - terrible customer service.

### "our experience was not good"
Baltimore to Frankfurt. Our first experience with Condor Airlines was not good. We boarded the plane in BWI and looked for our seats. There was no row 14 on this plane so we asked the flight attendant for assistance. She was already in a bad mood and told us that there was a change in planes and that we would need to just find a seat. My son and I were now seated apart for this flight. To make matters worse, another couple had the same experience and they moved them to business class. We asked to move there also and was told sorry, that despite open seats, there was not enough food to move us also. My real frustration is that I have contacted Condor 3 times via their online system and they will not respond to me. This is the height of snobbery from them. To intentionally ignore a customer's request is proof that they just do not care. Avoid this airline.

### "I was stranded in an airport"
Flew Condor Airlines from Austin, Texas to Frankfurt, Germany. Flight was delayed by 8 hours first time. Second time the plane had issues so I was stranded in an airport for 5 hours while customer service reps walked around and did nothing. Still have not heard on if they are going to reimburse for the time lost. The prices are inexpensive but there is a reason for this.

### "a nightmare to deal with"
Manchester to Almeria. I have no complaint about the flight. My complaint is that I thought I was booking with Thomas Cook on their site, however when I picked my flights, Condor which is the German arm of Thomas Cook came up, and I assumed it has TC logo on so it would be ok. Condor took six debits out of my account instead of 2. I made a complaint to Thomas Cook and they had it for 10 days and never bothered informing me of how it would be resolved. I phoned them up after 10 days and after being on the phone for an hour they informed me they don't know what the charges were for and to take it up with my bank to find out even though they all have the German logo on all the debits and all on the same day they came out, they dont know what the charges were for. I would never fly with Condor or Thomas Cook as I had 3 different flight numbers to get my boarding pass, they are a nightmare to deal with. they charge £12 for a seat which can add on £24 for each passenger.

### "overall I can recommend Condor"
Portland to Berlin via Frankfurt. Overall I can recommend Condor Airlines, having flown in 30K (window seat) on a long-haul flight from PDX to BER via FRA. While the features on board were modest and the seat pitch (29") was quite tight for this 6'2" passenger, given that the ticket price was so low. The dinner was nothing special, but the breakfast did at least include some pineapple and fruit. As other commentators have noted, economy only includes two films and two TV episodes, but there is a solid selection of music to listen to. My flight into FRA was delayed and I missed the LH connection to TXL, but this was easily resolved at the LH desk. I suspect that many critics of Condor have never flown a LCC before – given the low, low cost of the ticket I thought it was more than fair and I would fly them again. Not to be compared to a mainstream carrier but that's not what they're going for. My only criticism is that flight attendants sometimes did not give out two drinks (water and soda) if asked.

### "horrible customer service"
Frankfurt to Punta Cana via Puerta Plata. Condor Airlines is unprofessional and discourteous to its clients. A month before departure, we received an email telling us that our route had been altered with no offer of an alternative. We called the service center and they provided no compensation. Upon arrival in Frankfurt, we were informed that the flight had been delayed 3 hours with no explanation/  or anything to appease the customers. I called the hotline and the gentleman told me to submit a formal complaint that would take 4 weeks to process. There is no counter inside the terminal, no airline representative, a flight of people looking lost and confused. Bad business, horrible customer service.

### "was not impressed at all"
Horrible flight with Condor Airlines from Portland, OR to Frankfurt. The seats are extremely uncomfortable and my carry on ended up being taken out of my area by one of the stewardesses and placed in another compartment nowhere near where I was seated. Considering that I keep my medicine and have severe edema when flying, this was a problem because I couldn't not find my belongings when I needed my medicine. Portland to Frankfurt is a very long flight and yet you have to pay for the movies now? How cheap can you get? The food was awful and I ended up not eating. Before this flight, my computer had a virus and my information ended up being erased. I contacted the company immediately but they were not helpful. They wouldn't provide me any information. Luckily, my info was the system so when I showed up to the airport they already had all of my details. I was not impressed at all.

### "unprofessional and unfriendly"
I have flown Condor several times in business class cabin from Europe to the USA and vice versa. The cabin crew are decent and food meets the highest standards. My experience with the ground staff has always been terrible. The staff in Frankfurt are disorganized. Their instructions are unclear and witnessed their very poor interactions with customers including myself. Needless to say that it was almost impossible to find your way to the gate as there were no instructions for connecting passengers Yesterday I was flying from Portland to Frankfurt (connecting from Las Vegas). A long line of passengers were waiting in a long line 2 hours before the flight. The ground personnel showed up 50 minutes before the departure time while boarding was supposed to start at that time. The process of delivering boarding passes was very slow. An announcement that the flight was delayed was made 10 minutes before the departure time. All this was done in a very unprofessional and unfriendly way.

### "run away from this airline"
Los Angeles to Manchester. I entered my reservation information via a Condor webite and I was sent an email ticket that listed myself as two passengers. When I contacted the airline, they made me pay $230 to change the ticket to myself and my Mother, Condor sent me the wrong ticket information 5 more times. Run away from this airline. The customer pays when Condor makes mistakes. I complained to the ticket agent at Thomas Cook when I was checking in and he said they made his own daughter pay $130 when she changed her e-ticket from her maiden name to her married name. This is not the way customers should be treated. Deplorable, and you pay when they fail.

### "I would fly Condor again"
Cancun to Geneva via Frankfurt with Condor Airlines. Amazing flight and premium economy class was amazing. The seats have a lot more recline than in the standard economy class, and we were given a tooth brush, all meals, lots of entertainment, and water regularly. I looked around at the economy class seats and they were definitely a little more cramped, but it seemed the same as most airlines. The only negative review I can leave is that the flight was delayed, but considering that it's a low cost airline I was expecting it and was in no rush to get home. I would fly Condor again without any hesitation.

### "grateful for help Condor provided"
Frankfurt to Salvador da Bahia via Rio de Janeiro. I am satisfied with Condor! I had an experience to have a connecting flight with Condor from Germany to Brazil. I had a stupidity to miss that flight and to stuck in Germany for a little while. I felt frustrated about it as it was extremely important for me to get to Brazil. I went to the Customer Service in hope that they find a solution for me. And they did! They found a cheap convenient flight, a comfortable hotel to stay in for a night and even a taxi. Next day after that I was aboard the plane listening music from inflight entertainment that I enjoyed a lot. I’m really grateful for help Condor provided as I travelled alone and sometimes some awkward situations can happen with me.

### "I couldn’t move"
Barcelona to Seattle via Frankfurt. Got to BCN at 5:30 for an 8:00 flight. The taxi driver did not know which terminal, his company had never heard of Condor. No one in Terminal 2 had ever heard of Condor either. Tried Terminal 1 and followed some other English speakers as we finally found someone who pointed us to desk 500. Turns out we were on Lufthansa for the first leg. Luckily they had my flight, but had lost other peoples and one couple were forced to pay for a same day flight so she wasn’t left in Spain alone. First leg was good, short, reasonable. Second leg from Frankfurt to Seattle was a nightmare. The people at the terminal were rude, pointing brusquely in random directions and then ignoring us. I had to go to Terminal C which involved a shuttle in the terminal and going through security again, even though I was still inside the airport. Then it was a maze of hallways, confusing signs, security again and a long walk to the far end of yet another terminal, only to find out the flight was delayed almost 2 hours, which I found out from other passengers as the only agents left and didn’t return until just before the new flight time. The only food available on our side of security was the tax and duty free shop’s selection of alcohol and candy, or a choice of 8 or 10 sandwiches in a convenience shop. Choosing between going through their layers of security to get to a restaurant I had seen and a sketchy looking chicken wrap, I chose the chicken wrap. Then we waited. Strangely enough we had to take a crammed full bus to get to the plane out on the tarmac. The attendants were pleasant when we boarded. I was happy to see my Premium Economy seat had a pillow, a blanket and a footrest. Things were looking good. Then the plane got full. It was quite warm in our area, though I noted that the folks in the back half were all wrapped up in their blankets, the folks in our area were fanning themselves. There was supposed to be extra leg room and better food for the higher price. There may have been extra leg room but between the man in the seat ahead of me reclining as far as he could, the footrest, the pillow and blanket, and the man in the seat behind me being about 5 inches from my head I couldn’t move. Getting out to go to the restroom involved gymnastics. Then the food. I was delighted to be able to order a Diabetic meal. I would have been better off with the Economy meals. The attendant proudly delivered my Diabetic meal and I opened the cover to reveal potatoes, sliced fruit, 2 kinds of bread, a date bar, a heavily marinated salad and some water. Really? Which part of this is not carbs? Oh yes, the salad and the water. The snack, a few hours later, was a choice of apple slices, cheese and salami on white bread, or a plum cake. Really? Several hours later dinner was served. Again the attendant delivered my Diabetic meal. This time it was some spicy grains, covered with limp cheese, the sliced fruit, a stick of heavily marinated peppers and mushrooms, 3 kinds of bread, a date bar and water. Over 8 hours with nothing but carbs and water. I was not in good spirits when we finally got to Seattle Airport baggage claim, where we waited 25 minutes for our bags and many of us missed our connections.

### "excellent value for money"
Recife to Frankfurt with Condor. My trip started off with a 3 hour delay due to a technical in Frankfurt. As with any low cost, one should not expect a meal voucher during that time. That said, due to the delay the cabin crew and cockpit treated the flight like it was a full fare, everything included flight. Everyone got the full movie package (usually 8 euro's extra), a blancket, a better pillow (usually an extra cost) and some rather comfortable headphones. I was impressed from the get go. With the all the extra's I was not certain if I got the better meal too. It was a wonderful suprise as I initally wasn't sure what if might get a meal. This was my first time doing a medium to long haul flight on a low cost. Cabin crew walking through the aisle on regular intervals and handing out water to anyone who was awake. This to me made the flight. It's the small things that really add up. Our flight was on an older Boeing 767, I'm not usually a fan of this particular aircraft, but the seats were comfortable, had HD TV screens with a fair amount of movies to keep me occupied for the entire flight. Keep in mind I was given the full package due to the delay. Overall, I was highly impressed. Its excellent value for money.

### "need to get their act together"
Having booked a Business Class flight from Basel to Mauritius via Frankfurt, the BSL-FRA being Economy. Condor were unaware that the Most Significant Carrier rule applied to the booking. That means that the baggage allowance on the longest flight applies to all flights on the booking. Condor give 30kg in Business plus golf bag. BSL-FRA with Lufthansa only give 20kg in total. Condor were unaware of the MSC IATA rule and it required over one hour of telephone calls until I found someone at Condor who knew the rules, this was the second year running that we had this problem. Condor need to get their act together. As for the flight that was fine except the publicised "lay flat" seats don't lay flat. They are the old Lufthansa seats. Food was good and the service attentive especially on the return flight March 13th via Munich. The Boeing 767 is now an old aircraft and quite noisy, even at the front.

### "shame on you Condor"
Never again! Booked 9 months in advance. 2.5 weeks before departure of our flight from Frankfurt to Bangkok was given to Hifly, a cheap Airline from Portugal. We had lots of trouble cancelling our flight to Bangkok. Same with return flight: 2.5 weeks before they changed the flight from Condor to Hifly. Never again will I book a Condor flight. It's a good selling machine with a nice homepage but at the end you end up having problems only. Bad customer-service, endless hours in telefon-hotline-loops and as a customer you are worth nothing after you have booked the flight. Shame on you Condor.

### "he has to pay cash only"
Tenerife to Manchester with Condor Airlines and very bad service. They had no card machine onboard, and as it was a 4.5 hour flight I asked for a glass of water - I did not think it was unreasonable as on the incoming flight tea coffee and water was free. First stewardess said we only sell on this flight, explained that I had no cash I only had a card sorry - she checked with two others, no he has to pay cash only. It does not make sense especially with all the advertising saying what great service they have.

### "had a good experience"
Frankfurt to San José via Santo Domingo. Had a good experience on this flight. Friendly staff, good food and comfortable seats. It was definitely worth the money. One little thing was on the layover in Santo Domingo they wouldn't let us leave the plane. We had to wait for about 2h in the plane with out any service. But besides that I recommend this flight and airline.

### "never choose Condor again"
Cape Town to Frankfurt with Condor. As other reviews confirm, the substitution of aircraft types for others with smaller business class sections appears to be common practice at Condor. First, we tried to purchase additional luggage online: impossible. Then we called 2 days in a row the given phone number and end up, after 10mns of waiting with an unhelpful, disgruntled operator. Then we tried to check in online: impossible from Cape Town. Finally, at checkin we were downgraded to premium economy for a rough experience with a bossy, expeditive and pretty unpleasant crew. The 11 hrs 35 mns of flight give you ample time to think. Everyone understands that technical reasons have priority over anything else. What is unacceptable is the way the situation is handled. Why no advance warning to business class passengers so they can re-schedule? Why no Condor staff on site to handle? Why no reconfiguration of the premium business cabin (just move the separation) and at least offer business class service to the downgraded, if not the seat? Careless, complacent management of a situation is all it is. I shall, as my fellow downgraded passengers, never choose Condor again.

### "flights were excellent"
We booked Condor Airlines Premium Class from Providence to Frankfurt, which was available at the cost of a typical Coach Class ticket on other airlines serving airports in our region. On the day of departure we upgraded to Business Class (both directions). All aspects of our flights were excellent in both directions. The cabin crew was attentive and available throughout, the aircraft and amenities (IFE, meals, snacks, wine/beverages) fantastic, and the ease and convenience of traveling through a smaller international gateway (PVD) amplified all the great things Condor does. We had a separate check-in queue, priority boarding, were first in line at the CBP areas, it was simply great! The value of services and amenities versus price paid for transatlantic travel is un-paralleled!

### "we were disappointed"
Frankfurt to Punta Cana in business class. Been doing that trip for years with Air Berlin. We did the same trip a year ago and it had been a pleasure. Smiling check-in agent, great flight attendants, outstanding and attentive lady purser and not luxurious but tasty food. Serious improvement also as far as the shell seats are concerned in their new business cabin (equivalent to Air France's old 777 product). Only the ridiculous 400 EUR surcharge for 20 kg excess luggage was making us furious (we were staying 2 months abroad so we needed that and their standard was and still is not 32 kgs but 30 kgs per person). This second experience was all the contrary. Ground service from indifferent to non friendly personnel, announcing without previous warning that the plane (Condor Boeing 767-300 ER) was being replaced by a plane with no business class (a Portuguese HiFly leased A330). We were supposed to rebook (but it appeared later on that there was no business seat available within the next 9 days) or accept a downgrade to premium economy. One hour discussion at the ticketing counter did not help and they even sent us back our German tour operator who refused a rebooking with Air France via Paris. We accepted the downgrade forced by circumstances with a fear for a horrible 10 hours flight in a cramped seat in the main cabin. We are 64 and 58 and fly only business on long haul for more than 10 years. The flight was to depart the next day around noon (as we were doing a night before check-in, quite common in Germany). The next morning, thanks to the kindness of Condor check-in agents and possibly a software update missmatch (mentioned around this time by other reviewers), we could delay our departure with one day and have two business seats (not the ones we had reserved six months earlier, but still). Condor paid for hotel and food. The attitude of the cabin staff was as neutral/indifferent this time as the it had been wonderful the year before (until I asked for a customer satisfaction form). Not trying to have a real personal contact with business class passengers, and my wife should never have heard vulgar words spoken by the male chief purser to one of the attendants in the front galley. Besides that, the food was average and not impressive. We did not like this year's Champagne nor the South American red wine. Sauvignon blanc was better after a while. On the whole, we were disappointed and have come to the conclusion that Condor is inconsistent in their quality. We are Belgians but, through those long years of flying, always have had a very high opinion of German aviation professionalism and discipline. Come on Condor, wake up, you can do much better than that and you have already proven it.

### "normal Economy seats"
Frankfurt to Hurghada return, and Condor is low cost airline, so that was the service onboard flights. They gave me for a 4 hour flight just some nuts and water or tea/coffee. The prices to buy meals onboard were quite expensive but food was delicious. The cabin service was also okay. The seats were normal Economy seats like on other airlines like Lufthansa.

### "first and last time with them"
Cancun to Frankfurt via Munich with Condor Airlines - the first and last time with them. We called to the airline to book our flights but she booked the wrong flights. In Cancun our tickets were not available for the check in and we needed to call to Germany for 2 hours, to show them that we had a reservation. After we got the boarding pass we arrived the first destination where we had to switch the plane. There was also no ticket available for us (because of same system errors) - so we had to wait 5 hours for another flight to our final destination.

### "waiting over 5 months for refund"
Our Punta Cana to Paris flight was delayed by 5 days which is not the complaint, although bad enough in and of itself. They were entirely disorganized in how to handle an entire flight of people not having their flight leave as planned due to their airplane having problems. The main complaint comes from waiting over 5 months for my refund and never having a prompt reply from them or the requested info when they claim to have reimbursed me and have not!! They agree to reimburse us Euro 1200 for the flights - which I am still waiting for and hoping they ever reply to the emails I send. Dismal service - add in to that during the 5 days of delay we never knew day to day when we would be flying etc. When we finally flew, they then wanted us to pay the infight entertainment, were treated like regular bookings and not allowed a free glass of wine etc. After waiting 5-6 hours in airport before flight initially cancelled, paying for an entire day of food in airport. Our luggage was dented and ruined as well, but nothing extra in the reimbursement for that as the max refund is euro 600 per traveller.

### "flight experience was excellent"
My family (wife and 5 year old daughter) and I flew Condor outbound from Frankfurt to Windhoek departing Dec 9th. Check-in in Frankfurt very quick and efficient with friendly staff. Boarding process very quick although flight was quite full. Very attentive and children friendly. Were seated in middle row together (2-3-2) - seat comfort with new cabin good and comfortable with in-flight entertainment (chargeable). Departed on time. Food tasty. Cabin staff very attentive / friendly - pilot explained route and technical specs. Arrived on time next morning. Overall flight experience was excellent considering direct flight / ticket price and warm and friendly staff. Have already considered Condor for our trips in 2016.

### "attentive and children friendly"
My family (wife and 5 year old daughter) and I flew Condor inbound from Windhoek to Frankfurt departing Dec 31st. Same experience as for our outbound flight in summary: Check-in in Windhoek very quick and efficient with friendly staff. Boarding process very quick although flight was again quite full. Very attentive and children friendly. Were seated in middle row together (2-3-2) - seat comfort with new cabin good and comfortable with in-flight entertainment (chargeable) Departed on time Food tasty Cabin staff very attentive / friendly (purser making jokes and tailored specific to New Years) - pilot explained route and technical specs. Arrived on time next morning. Overall flight was excellent considering direct flight / ticket price and warm and friendly staff. As mentioned on my inbound review I have already considered Condor for our trips in 2016.

### "staff appeared surly"
Manchester to Las Vegas via Frankfurt with Condor Airlines. Paid for an upgrade to premium economy. The legroom was not great. Films and audio average. The attendant light was ignored and was mortified to be charged for a small tub of Pringles after paying £189 each for upgrade - not impressed! Staff appeared surly and indifferent.

### "lack of Customer Service"
The Condor Airlines plane was in great condition and the flight in Business Class from Frankfurt to San Jose was generally enjoyable. However the lack of Customer Service ruined the overall nice flight experience. Flight attendants were very friendly, the food was good, drinks (incl. Champagne) as well and though the seats did not recline fully (only up to 170°), we slept very well. They show a lot of new films, which are free in Business and Premium Class. In Business you have a large 15 inch monitor (compared to 9 inch in Premium and Economy). Unfortunately we tried to change our return flight, which turned out to be impossible. Due to a system upgrade - according to Condor - we could not access our booking online. When we tried to call the office in SJO (CR) they told us, that due to a system failure, they could not change our booking and that we needed to call the office in Germany. This we tried a couple of times, but always ended up in the waiting loop. We tried to contact them by mail, but no response was given in 3 days. I cannot recommend an airline that completely fails when it comes to services on the ground.

### "extremely uncomfortable"
Flight was with Condor but was actually a really old Thomas Cook plane that Condor had leased for the summer. Really worn out and from the early nineties I think. The plane had to turn around after 3 hours as the navigation system failed and return to Frnakfurt for repair. We had a 22 hour delay and very poor treatment and little information as to how our journey would continue. We missed the first day of our tour. The return journey was in a more modern plane but the smallest seats I've sat in. Extremely uncomfortable for such a long flight. The inflight entertainment was also chargeable (and if you'd paid you'd have been disappointed to find the plane was so old it didn't have any). Seats choice was chargeable, no vegetarian meal (unless, of course you paid an expensive fee). Condor have ignored all our claims for the 600 Euros compensation we are each due for the 22 hour delay.

### "comfortable and enjoyable"
My flight from Antalya to Frankfurt with Condor Airlines was comfortable and enjoyable. Also new leather seats were installed in that aircraft. It was nice that free snack and drinks were available on this airline. Boeing 757-300 was perfect for short-medium haul flight and entertainment was good. I liked music programme. I can recommend Condor.

### "the cabin crew were great"
We were booked to fly with Thomas Cook from Manchester to Fuerteventura, but they transferred us to their partner airline, Condor Airlines. We had never heard of Condor Airlines so were very sceptical. However, the aircraft was larger than expected, had more leg room and the cabin crew were great. Flights were on time and we even got free tea, coffee or water on the return leg, which is unheard of on UK airlines. Would definitely fly with Condor Airlines again.

### "Condor cheats on coffee"
I flew economy class on Condor Airlines from the USA to Germany. I chose the airline because the price was significantly lower than competitor airlines. The flight was okay, the cabin service adequate. The quality and quantity of food service was minimal - a vague, bland pasta/pesto main dish was virtually tasteless. Portions of salad and dessert were microscopic. The worst insult to the passengers was that Condor cheats on coffee - it serves an inferior instant (powdered) variety instead of brewed coffee. This is unheard of on a transatlantic flight. The product is undrinkable for all but the most uncritical (or desperate) of coffee drinkers. Use this airline if you are budget-minded and an uncritical eater. It will get you from point A to point B, but don't expect any frills. Maybe they serve real coffee in first class? ?

### "you get what you pay for"
My experience with them was good, the plane looked like new, flight on time, service is a little cold, cheap flight so you get what you pay for, only one meal option, you pay extra for some drinks, seats, movies, audios etc... Legroom is good, cabin crew are hit or miss, some friendly some indifferent, will fly them again if the price is right. They park on remote stands so if you have walking difficulties keep that in mind.

### "shocked by stewardess behaviour"
The Condor Airlines call center staff gave wrong info regarding extra baggage for fragile items, which caused a huge problem for us. The call center staff refused to apologize for that. The ground staff in Seattle were unhelpful and cold when I was clearly in distress. The flight crew failed to answer the call button 5 times, and I had to flag them down. Once I had attention of a stewardess, she refused to help get down my carry-on from the overhead luggage: first, she said, "you can't get it? I told her that no, I couldn't (I'm way too short, plus, I was travelling alone with a 4 month old). Instead of asking a colleague to help her on my behalf, the stewardess told me, "I can't get it, it is too heavy. When I looked at her with confusion, she proceeded to say, "It's your stuff, isn't it? In the end, another passenger (who I note was as shocked by the stewardess' behavior as I was) got my bag for me. Immediately upon returning, I filled the online complaint form but never got a reply (it has been 4 months!). I've checked about my complaint multiple times, but the call center "doesn't handle complaints" and has advised me to resubmit the form or send an email to the complaints department. Despite 5 complaint forms, 30+ emails and 50+ phone calls, Condor Airlines has never responded to complaint.

### "cabin crew could smile some more"
Boarding at FRA airport took a while as there was only one gate agent and the self boarding gates were not opened. It seems Condor Airlines do not use them for an unknown reason. I had to use the bus to the aircraft and due to the size of FRA this took nearly 10 minutes, not including the wait time when the bus was next to the plane. A warm welcome from the cabin crew and offered help to find my seat and stow cabin baggage. During the flight, the cabin crew served coffee, tea, water and a little snack for free, other drinks/foods could be bought. While it is okay for me to get only a small snack and water, I would expect that this reduction of service somehow makes its way to the adjustment of ticket pricing but they stay at a constant level. Especially reserving a seat for EUR 25 (emergency exit row) seems quite high for me on a short haul flight. Also to listen to the in-flight entertainment, you need to buy a headphone for EUR 3,50. Cabin crew professional but not too friendly, could smile some more. There were some announcements from the flight deck but with quite low volume so they was hard to understand.

### "no safety checks were completed"
Condor Airlines has no concept of safety, appearance or hospitality. The stewardesses look drab, hair was a mess and not off the neck. They spoke in German without even bothering to ask if we were English. Upon departure and arrival, no safety checks were completed to ensure all bags were safely stowed under the seat or in the overhead bins. A woman sitting beside my husband in the 2nd row, had a huge straw basket on her lap the entire journey. When the stewardess went by to check for safety belts, she made no attempt to ask the passenger to stow her bag.

### "fly again only in premium economy"
We got a good price with Condor Airlines for our trip from Vancouver to Frankfurt. I wanted premium economy but it was sold out. We opted for the exit row seating 23A/C. The bad was that the overhead bins above the seat contained oxygen equipment so you could not put your carryon in there. Although approved by the airport check-in staff, the bags we had would not fit under the seat in front either. So we had to find other available space which wound up being quite a ways from where we were sitting. The window seat was very cold at altitude, my whole left side was freezing and there is no air vent to adjust. We checked in online and were told we could just go to the counter and go to the baggage drop and we would be done. When we got to the long line up we were told that we had to line up with everyone else. I finally saw a sign that said baggage drop and so we got out of the long line and went to the much shorter baggage drop line. The onboard entertainment was dreadful, a choice of 4 kids movies unless you wanted to pay extra for the "premium package". Take your own entertainment system. The good - price and food was okay, legroom was great in the exit row, staff friendly and helpful. We had a continuing flight from Frankfurt to Prague and Frankfurt airport is a terrible place to change planes, make sure you have lots of time between flights. We went to an info counter to ask directions and an uninterested young lady just pointed at the immigration line across the way. We were in the line for a while until we got close enough to see we were in a Euro passport line, so it was out of that line and into the proper one. Through immigration no problem, then find our flight on the departures board and start to make our way there. We walked one direction for about a kilometre, took an elevator down and walked back the opposite direction for the same kilometre. Then down a flight of stairs and made our way through security again, and into a waiting room to catch a bus to our flight. Would we fly Condor again- yes, but only in premium economy or an exit row. Would we go to Frankfurt again, not if we could avoid it.

### "aircraft and inflight service very good"
Vancouver to Frankfurt return with Condor Airlines. The check in, aircraft and in-flight service were very good, but there was a long line at Frankfurt for the return flight. I should have checked in online! Apart from the food the standard was certainly as good as Air Canada, so my experience, although limited, was good. I would not hesitate to use Condor Airlines again.

### Condor Airlines customer review
I flew to Europe and back on this airline and they were really good. The customer service on the phone is okay and could use some work, but the flight was really good. The food wasn't bad and the attendants were really nice. Also, some really nice prices to get across the pond! I paid $799 to fly from Seattle to Prague (stops in between) and $709 from Paris to Las Vegas (one stop in between). It was excellent.

### Condor Airlines customer review
My wife and I flew round trip to Frankfurt from Seattle on Condor Airlines and could not have had a better experience. We have flown on Delta, Alaska, Lufthansa, and American in the past 6 months and we both feel that Condor Airlines was a superior airline. Agents at the airport, flight crews, aircraft and meals were great. It was our first time on Condor and having read some of the reviews on this site we were a little apprehensive going in, but now would not hesitate flying Condor again.

### Condor Airlines customer review
Staff at the check-in desk didn't seem to work for the airline, wanted to charge for overweight baggage when we were 3 kg below allowance. We were prepared for the worst, so they didn't take advantage, but we saw people being stung. Not a real bargain for a non-food "premium" long haul flight. Never again.

### Condor Airlines customer review
Pretty poor overall. Very poor communications re a connecting Lufthansa flight and sports equipment which Condor could not manage to sort but at the last minute helpful Lufthansa did. A 3.5 hr delay on the way out, barely an apology. You get what you pay for in economy, but we upgraded on the way back to get improved legroom, but got the bulkhead seat which was worse than economy, so when I was told to get my feet out from stretching beyond the curtain into Business class I was less than impressed. Mailed Condor after the flight to take up all three points - 10 days on still waiting for the courtesy of an acknowledgement let alone a reply. Basic customer service seems to be a bit of a struggle here.

After seeing the reviews on here I was very nervous about using this airline, but the price ultimately made the decision for me. While the flight was definitely late (45 mins) it didn't matter to me at all as I had no connecting flights. Condor offered a straight flight from Providence to Frankfurt, Germany which was perfect for us. They only offered very limited television for our section, however it was made clear before we bought the tickets so there are no complaints about that either. The interior was brand new on board with usb chargers at each seat, even the coach section. I would without a doubt fly with them again.

Flew non-stop Frankfurt to Minneapolis in economy. Flight was normal like any commercial flight. Online check in simple, however seat selection only possible for a fee. I did not use seat selection but airline placed our party in one row so no issue. Fight left gate on time but sat a bit on the tarmac, arrival was on time. Arrived at FRA airport 2 hours 15 minutes early and check in easy with only a short wait. One bag checked free. Security was gate specific so opened and closed just for the flight. Cabin interior just redone, very new and seat back TV screens were high quality. Free in-flight service included one hot meal and one cold meal, plus 4 or 5 beverage services with soft drinks free. Bottle of water provided for each seat. Only downsides of flight were tight legroom (I am 6'-2" but managed OK), limited entertainment: 2 movies free (1 adult and 1 kids movie, plus 2 TV shows), and no air vent at the seat but temperature was OK without it. Would consider flying Condor again.

We booked with Condor but the flight was with Omni Air a Us company. First we could not book our flight from GVA to USA as the access is not possible from another place than Condor desk. So we arrived quite late and had to run to the Condor desk and got very wrong information from the staff so we arrived late at the right desk and we were 7 travelling together and got not seated next to each other. Then onboard old aircraft with no video seats, they sell DVD player for 8 euros but they had not enough for everyone so only the seats in the front could buy it - it is a very long flight so without entertainment it is even longer. If you get good seats you can watch the movies chosen by the company on the few screens they have in the middle but our seats were not in the middle, so bad view for this purpose. The staff on board was very nice and friendly. I will never fly again with Condor.

### Condor Airlines customer review
I have been flying for over 50 yrs and this was the worst airline experience. This flight was scheduled to leave at 8.45 pm on June 27th, 2015. Approximately six weeks prior to departure our travel agent informed us that the return flight would be later which we were ok with. When we received our new itinerary on May 9th we were shocked to find that our departure had also changed to 11.45pm on June 27th. This delay, which our travel agent said she was not originally informed of, of course negatively impacted our travel plans and hotel reservations. Six weeks prior to departure it was of course also impossible to find a reasonably priced flight for the same date for eight people. The plane arrived at the gate late (no passengers disembarked) but we watched through the window as large crates of cargo were unloaded from the plane. As midnight came and went we asked the gate staff if we were going to make our connecting flight in Frankfurt – they reassured us we would. We asked multiple times over the next hour and each time got the same assurance. They then informed us that the flight was delayed because they needed to clean and provision the plane for our flight. The time approached 1 am (technically the next day June 28th) before boarding commenced. The pilot and head flight attendant at the plane entrance again reassured us that we would make our connecting flight no problem. They then informed us that the delay in the flight was due to refueling. We didn’t take off until 1.30 am. Upon arriving in Frankfurt there was no direction on how to catch our connecting flights we had originally scheduled an hour and 25 minute to make our connection – but of course we left an hour and 45 minutes behind schedule. We parked at Concourse A and unloaded. We had to board the airport buses which took us to the other side of the airport – Concourse C. No one met the 15-20+ passengers who had our connecting flight to Munich or provided direction. We found our departure gate, back at Concourse A, and ran through the airport to try to make our flight – other passengers were with us. They rushed us through the security checkpoints but we were still delayed. We arrived at the gate to have Lufthansa inform us that the flight left 5 minutes ago and it was not their fault. Apparently Condor had not communicated with them allowing the 15-20 passengers to make our connection. We felt the Condor staff who promised we would make the connection had lied to us and worse yet made no provision for the connection. We then had to go across the whole airport once again to the Condor desk. Where upon the desk staff made us feel like it was our fault we missed the flight, were unfriendly, unsympathetic and made little attempt to find a solution except for a flight to Munich 3+ hours later – which again would have interfered with our hotel reservations. Unwilling to wait or delay any longer our family discussed the situation and we made arrangements with our rental car to start our trip and drive from Frankfurt. But Condor then proceeded to lose our bags for an hour and a half and said they would not forward our bags if they could not find them. We got to our destination at 1.30 am. We had issues on our return flight as well - a gate change less than hour before the flight with no notice.

### Condor Airlines customer review
I am used to flying business class with the traditional big carriers when flying internationally (Air Canada, Lufthansa) so I was unsure what to expect when flying with Condor. I was headed to Nice to attend a friends wedding and had enough miles to get there for free via Lufthansa but was short a few thousand for the return. Condor offered a great fare for business and I figured because it was affiliated with Lufthansa it wouldn't be so bad. For the most part I was right. When I arrived in Frankfurt from Nice it took at least 20 minutes to get to the gate. Not a problem since I had a 4 hour layover. However there were no food options in the terminal (minus a duty free and some vending machines) so we had to exit the terminal and go back through security to get to an area where we could eat. Luckily we didn't have to go back through immigration. After eating we went back to the gate and were greeted with a long line. Unbeknownst to me or my friends we had to go through security again, before we could enter the actual gate area. There was no separate line for business class passengers and once through security, there was a Condor check in process that added another 10 minutes before you could actually grab a seat at the gate. Once in the gate area, there is a small store where you can buy water and chips but not much else. Not a deal breaker. We finally boarded and they let business class passengers board first. As we walked onto the plane I noticed that it wasn't an actual Condor plane. It was a 757 that belonged to Eastern (I think). It appears Condor rents the plane but uses their own crew. The cabin layout was 2-3-2 throughout. All seats appeared to be the same width but Business Class had more pitch. I'm about 5'10 and could stretch my feet out comfortably. Although it sold as Business Class it was more like premium economy in my opinion. The seats were not lie flat, but at the ticket price, I won't complain. I could tell that the plane was old and refitted. There was no entertainment system in the seat back which annoyed me. As we were taking off, I could really tell that we were in an old plane. I fly weekly for work, so I know a smooth take-off vs a rough one. This was a rough take off and the screen on the bulk head actually showed us losing altitude at some point. Can't lie I was a tad nervous. We finally hit 10,000 feet and things started to get better. The cabin crew came by and gave everyone in Business Class a portable entertainment system to compensate for it not being in the seat back. They were kind of bulky (think a portable playstation) but the movie selection was great and so was the quality. It was free for Business Class but I think there was a nominal fee for everyone else. The food selection was good enough. I wasn't expecting 5 star dining, but the lunch was tasty and filling and the cabin crew was very attentive and helpful. I fell asleep for half of the flight and woke up for the second serving which was also tasty and filling. All in all it was a pleasurable experience given the price I paid for my ticket. I would fly with them again, but only if its on one of their aircraft, and not one that they lease.

### Condor Airlines customer review
The inflight service was poor. Had to pay for TV and movies - 8 euros. Headphones extra. Food was awful. Flight attendents never answer call bells. Had to use busses from the tarmac to the airport in Germany. I would never recommend this flight or take it again.

### Condor Airlines customer review
Bought tickets on Condor for $500 one way Calgary to Frankfurt. For the price I paid the airline met my expectations. Checked in online but the website is not user friendly and after entering data for 6 people was told system was unavailable. I chose the option of not paying to preselect seats and it seemed as if it was a scam to have me pay out of frustration with the free option. It eventually worked and we got 6 seats together. Condor doesn't have a bag drop option in Calgary we had to stand in the checkin line for 45 mins even though we were checked in. It was the first flight of the year from Calgary so once fully boarded we sat in the plane for an hour because the contracted ground handler didn't train their staff on condors systems. The pilot told us such. Once enroute the flight was fine. Entertainment was one free basic movie and then a small fee to access the premium content. Overall selection was mediocre. Dinner and breakfast were served and again the food was mediocre. Crew were fairly robotic and weren't overly friendly. One of our bags were lost but eventually turned up an hour later in Frankfurt due to a handling error. Overall you have to remember it's a budget airline and you get what you pay for. I would use them again.

### Condor Airlines customer review
When we finally boarded the flight (1.5 hrs late) the plane was not clean and the seat and inflight video in business class was not working. The flight crew was not able to assist and they offered no compensation or rectification for the situation. The food was okay but the selection of drinks in business class was extremely limited. The seat did not fully extend flat due to it not being operating properly. The connection time in FRA is not enough time although it is a legal connection in their system. One must give themselves at least 2 hours between flights. Condor have limited gates and the size of FRA requires at least 2 hours for connection. On our return, I was injured a day prior to our flight and we contacted Condor to reschedule our flight and to request a wheel chair and was refused due to their rules for needing at least 7 days notice for any request changes. Flying business class and not having any customer service was astonishing. We had to contact the airport to arrange our own services. When we arrived at the gate in FRA, we were told business class was oversold and we were asked to fly another airline to get home. We asked if wee would be in business class and if we would have seats together and would our luggage be on the flight. The Condor representative assured us all would occur. When we arrived at the other airline, we did not have seats in business class, we did not have seats together, and our luggage was not in their system. The other airline called Condor to get the information but no one at the Condor gate would answer. We had to work with the other airline by ourselves. The price is cheaper on Condor and there is a reason. This was the worst travel experience I have ever had.

### Condor Airlines customer review
I flew in Business Class from Portland to Frankfurt in June 2015. I often fly across the Atlantic for business and have a status with Lufthansa so I am used to Business Class cabins on the 'big' carriers. I didn't know what to expect when I had to fly to Frankfurt from Portland on Condor but I must say that I was positively surprised by the service received on board the aircraft. It's not comparable to Business Class on the big airlines but it's definitely worth the money. Still get your lie-flat (though not horizontal), great meal service, IFE and so on.

### Condor Airlines customer review
Booked to go from Portland, Oregon to Tel Aviv, Israel for a 2 week trip. Outbound Alaska Air from Portland to Vegas, Condor Vegas to Frankfurt, El Al Frankfurt to Tel Aviv. Only learned after booking the flight that I could not check-in online, but instead had to check-in with each carrier at Portland, Vegas and Frankfurt airports. This meant arriving in Vegas, exiting security, collecting bags, waiting in line to check in and re-check bags, and then re-entering security. Bags were booked through Frankfurt to our final destination, but in Frankfurt we had to go through customs/passport clearance to exit the terminal in order to be able to check in for the next flight. Return Tel Aviv - Frankfurt - Portland we had 1 hr 50 mins between flights and only just made the connection - we were the last people to board. To top it off, when the bus brought us around to board the plane on the tarmac, I noticed my bag sitting on a baggage cart. Only when I spoke to a supervisor did he go over and tell a handler to put the bag on the plane. After getting to Portland, my bag arrived but my wife's and two sons' three bags did not. We filed lost bag reports with a "Condor rep" who was at baggage claim. Now it's been 48 hrs and after waiting 30 minutes on hold on the phone, Condor is claiming that they aren't responsible for the lost bags and we need to talk with Portland Airport lost and found.

### Condor Airlines customer review
Condor had changed our flight times without us knowing it. We showed up at the airport 2.5 hours before the original flight flew. We were told that we are not on the list. After hours of phone calls all they could tell us was "There's nothing we can do". Didn't attempt to book us on a different flight, no money back, absolutely nothing. The worst customer service I've seen.

### Condor Airlines customer review
My wife and I arrived at the Fresno airport to board our flight (Alaska airlines) to Portland. Alaska personnel had no itinerary listed for us. Called Condor who did all of the booking and was told that we cancelled our flight 7 months earlier. What? Called Alaska airlines who explained that Condor cancelled the flight and failed to let us know. Condor customer service agent later admitted that the mistake was on their end. Told me the best they could do is reschedule the flight for the next day. She told me that they would try to re-route us on another airline. OK. I just need to be in Frankfurt. Came back on the line and told me the request was denied by her supervisor. I asked to speak to the supervisor (5 times) and was never allowed to do so. My wife and I had to settle for a departure the next day. Now at home, changing hotel reservations, rental car information, etc. The whole process took 3 hours of my fixing Condor's error.

### Condor Airlines customer review
Worst experience. Booked well in advance and when we went to check in, we found out that we were not next to each other - we were told that we should have paid to reserve our seat. Isn't that why we pay over $600 when we book? This made us end up with the middle seat with 6 rows in between us.

### Condor Airlines customer review
We were supposed to leave Vancouver to Frankfurt on May 3 at 6.20 pm and after sitting on the runway and back at the gate for 3 hours while they said they had technical problems we were told the flight was cancelled. We got on the bus supplied to the Hilton hotel and got there at midnight no food onboard and nothing at the hotel. Next day we were told the flight would not go until the following day - 2 days late. We flew on same plane same seat 2 days late. They gave us a voucher for 600 euros to fly Condor but it has to be activated by phone and we have had 3 different people who speak German call and after waiting on hold for up to 40 minutes as soon as they say voucher they hang up. I doubt if we will ever get to use our voucher. It has been a very frustrating experience.

### Condor Airlines customer review
When one orders Premium Economy class tickets one would expect to get free drinks onboard the flight throughout the entire flight and not only when the flight attendant come around with the cart. Also when one pushes the call button for the attendant to come to my seat one would expect the attendant to come within 30 minutes and just not ignore the call light. I was in the rear of the plan and I saw 5 customer call lights on in the rear of the plane on the ceiling and 4 flight attendants sat under then ignoring them as if they did not exist? I looked throughout the cabin and there were 5 lights on at various locations but not one single attendant answered the calls. They continued to sit in the back of the plane discussing their issues with each other as if the passengers never existed. Another issue 4 bathrooms for over 250 passengers? Located in the rear of the plane only. I will not fly Condor again. Cheaper is not always better and in this case poor service bad equipment on the plane food that was upgraded for $20.00 per person both outbound and inbound was a joke. Next time I'll book with Lufthansa.

6 May 2015 DE 3049. Return was 25 May 2015 DE 1048. We booked with Condor and it was our first experience with the airline. My wife is handicapped and we chose to use our own scooter on a three week trip to Germany and area. Nothing could have gone smoother on this trip as far as the airline is concerned. They did everything to make the airport transition smooth and we do appreciate that. We will not hesitate to go with Condor again. Also the cabin staff did a great job as well.

DR2264 DE4265 Business Class. Just arrived in Frankfurt from a return trip to Mombasa. Condor Business Class on the 767 is second to none! Fabulous food service and all round high quality. Highly recommended!

### Condor Airlines customer review
Condor could not communicate to the connection flight company that we were flying with our baby. This made very difficult to check-in. The check-in was finally successful thanks to the personnel of the airport which understood the situation and bent the rules (always within safety and security limits) to allow us enough time to have Condor making a last minute correction. This "last minute correction" involved us calling the call center 5 times with the regular few minutes waiting time having to explain the problem from the beginning to 5 different people. We were timely (2h00 before departure) at the airport for the check-in if we would have been only few minutes later we would have lost the flight. The problem happened both ways. Remembering our experience on the way in the day before departure we called and asked to check the situation. The problem was indeed still present. Therefore we kindly asked them to correct it. Although we received a positive answer on the day of departure the same problem happened again. The inflight entertainment is an additional fee per person. This was not clear on the ticket. Experienced people were having their personal tablet loaded with entertainment.

I traveled with my wife and two year old daughter round trip from Germany to Miami and it was less than pleasurable. I already don't expect much but at least I would think that we would have access to air conditioning. They did have the air on a little before we were about to take off but as soon as we got into the air either it was turned down to minimum or it was turned off. Since we were not traveling First Class or Economy Plus we only had one meal option - it was the same meal (Pasta with tomato sauce) on both flight. For our entertainment we had the option of watching either one movie or one episode of Modern Family (on a nine hour flight). They do have other movies that they offer but of course for an extra fee. Don't expect much leg room because you will not get it. The seat rows are very tight so most likely you will be up most of the time stretching your legs out. When we finally got off the plane we had to wait almost an hour for our bags (even after we had already completed going through customs). Definitely would not choose this airline again.

### Condor Airlines customer review
I recently made a round trip between Frankfurt and Kilimanjaro airport. All in all I'd have to say that the experience exceeded my expectations given all the negative comments I've seen. On the way to East Africa flight was full and there was a flight attendant at the gate who walked around and lifted our hand carried luggage and placed a sticker on it after examination. I was a bit worried since I had my SLR and 2 lenses on it causing it to exceed the 12lbs but she wasn't too concerned. On the way back flight was 2/3 empty so the luggage weight wasn't even an issue. Food on board was decent. I did pay the 5Euros to get my entertainment so that was my only complaint.

### Condor Airlines customer review
The only good thing about my flights to and from Europe with Condor was that they were on time - for departure and arrival. Their website is the worst imaginable! Just try to get into it to book your seat selections! Hours and hours of wasted time and that's to 'pay for the seats'. The leg room is pitiful the meals - let's not go there. The in-cabin staff are at a absolute minimum barely visible during the 9-10 hour flights. I will never travel with this company again.

### Condor Airlines customer review
Mid July I flew from Frankfurt to Toronto. I had booked my flight in what they refer to as Comfort Class which would generally be in between economy plus and business class on major airlines. The flight was disappointing as they changed aircraft and the alternate plane was not equipped to offer Comfort Class. This was the second time this happened to me with Condor on the same route the year before. The negative rating is owed to the fact that the comfort provided did not match the comfort booked. Condor had chartered the plane from a British charter provider. The staff was very friendly. The food was adequate for economy class but inadequate for an elevated service class. Their customer service department is completely unresponsive.

### Condor Airlines customer review
I did not know about this airline but was in a hurry so booked the Frankfurt - Calgary flight I usually fly good old Lufthansa. Now that I know it is a budget airline I'm less furious about the extra fees on the baggage steep fee of $200 to upgrade to Econ premium $8 glass of wine condescending attendants and ground staff cramped space $8 extra headphone $8 to watch a movie. Let me put it this way: if you want to be penny wise pound foolish and don't mind bearing light humiliation from staff and service alike go ahead: Bon Voyage in the ultimate 10.5 hrs cattle class experience.

### Condor Airlines customer review
It was my first flight with Condor and it will be my last the outward flight was 3hrs late and the inward flight was over an hour late. The cabin crew were rude to but worst of all they did no cabin checks before take off or landing - a lot of the seats were not upright and some people didn't have seat belts on.

### Condor Airlines customer review
Will never fly with them again. Delayed by almost 5 hours on way out and even had to land half way there to change crew before we could do the rest of our journey and they didn't really bother to give us any information as to how long the additional delays were and the reason behind it. Then as if the way out wasn't bad enough we were then delayed for another 2.5 hours on the way home! Absolutely horrendous service and the plane was horrible the seats had literally no room - herding cattle came to mind when squished in the tiny seats with zero leg room.

### Condor Airlines customer review
I flew on Condor from Frankfurt to Seattle. For an international flight the service was rather good. Meals were above average and there was more leg space than anticipated (but then I am a small person). However I was disappointed because this flight was delayed by 4 hours causing me to miss my connecting flight. There was no transparency about the reasons for the delay. We were given no advance warnings even having signed up for mail alerts. Despite getting complimentary cocktails and unlimited access to the entertainment system the bottom line is that this flight was abnormally late (whereas all the other flights in the entire terminal were within 30 minutes of scheduled departure) and we were not updated at all on the situation.

### Condor Airlines customer review
Frankfurt to Panama (via Santo Domingo). Great refurbished B767 with nice interior. Nice seats but there is not enough legroom (I am 1.90m tall). Nice food (dinner breakfast snack) good drink selection (many alcoholic drink are not free of charge in eco class). Nice crew. Considering that is Condor low cost carrier (I paid a Zagreb-Lima ticket 404€) I shouldnt complain so much about poor legroom a little bit disabled entertainment programme (you have to pay to watch movies) etc. I dont like that when you buy a ticket they put extra cost for paying with a credit card they should involve that cost in the price of ticket. Also I think that the stop in S.Domingo should be no longer then 1.30h. Staying in the middle of the night on almost empty airport is so boring. All in all I really recommend Condor and will use their service again if they offer these low cost prices.

### Condor Airlines customer review
Having mostly dealt with North American airlines previously I feel that Condor has excellent customer service. We made a mistake when booking our flight and when we called their customer service number the call was picked up very quickly and the agent who picked up was able to help us fix the problem right away-no waiting no transfers which is practically unheard of nowadays. We also ended up corresponding with their Goodwill Department and they were very kind to us. Their in-flight entertainment system is a very nice touch screen monitor that allows you to charge your electronic devices via a standard USB cable and there is a nice selection of music for free although there is only one movie and one TV show free for viewing. Their in-flight meals are terrible to be honest but I'm happy to be fed at all considering I've been in 6-hour flights with other airlines that barely give you a snack. I would highly recommend Condor simply because they have always been very helpful and it has always been a pleasure dealing with them.

### Condor Airlines customer review
Minneapolis to Frankfurt and return. The price and on-board service was great. Planes are new-ish 767s. The economy class section seats are very crowded. I recommend you upgrade to premium economy as I did with nicer seats more room free movies complimentary alcohol. I highly recommend and even with the upgrade it is far far less expensive than the usual US carriers that fly out of Minneapolis. My recommendation is based on the premium economy seating.

### Condor Airlines customer review
I flew Business Class Frankfurt-Calgary at the beginning of July. I usually fly British Airways Club Class. Overall the experience was quite pleasant and the "value for your money" was great. Flying on short notice at the height of summer business cabins on the major airlines are either booked up or exceedingly expensive so this ended up as a great option. Having said that though I don't care much about the in-flight experience I just need lounge access a comfortable seat for sleeping and a non-disgusting bathroom. If you're after the more service oriented perks of flying Business class Condor might not be for you. Seat Comfort: The seat while not lie flat like on BA is certainly comfortable enough to survive a long-haul flight without feeling like one has been hit by a bus. There can however be the sensation of sliding down the seat but this can be remedied with an additional pillow placed by the feet. If you can find one. I took one from an empty seat not sure whether they keep those stocked. Food: Acceptable but nothing to write home about. For me this was not an issue I tend to take healthy snacks and sleep for the large majority of the flight. My seat neighbour did not rave about the food either. Bathroom: My reason for flying business class is at least in part based on my aversion to airplane washrooms which I find to be cleaner and more available in business. Condor definitely met my expectations here there was one washroom for 18 seats and it was spacious enough and clean. Lounge use: Another key reason for business class of course is the lounge access. As I flew out of FRA Condor gave me a voucher for one of the Lufthansa business class lounges which was great of course. The food offerings were not as good as say Heathrow's Galleries options but that may be because I am vegetarian and the Germans love their meat. Overall Service: The flight attendants I encountered were pleasant ground level staff less so but that tends to be the norm in FRA. One annoying thing is that here is no priority boarding as they use buses in FRA. This might be different at other airports.

Calgary to Frankfurt 25th July Flight 5095. My wife and infant travelled this flight last week it was terrible. We were told during check in that we would be given a bassinet onboard which we didn't get. Overall experience was bad and inflight service was pretty poor.

From Calgary airport to Frankfurt. I was impressed by the good service and looking forward to use Condor again. Very good service for a good price! They are on a good way to become a 4 star airline just a few improvements.

### Condor Airlines customer review
I flew from Frankfurt to Toronto for the first time in July. Although it was economy class I was surprised by the good service food and the new interior design after reading a lot of negative reviews. However the entertainment system should be free for all and then they would get 5 stars from me.

### Condor Airlines customer review
Great Experience for Low Cost travel. What I liked: New aircraft's from Minneapolis to Frankfurt and back. Easy booking experience and economical fare. On time both ways. Got upgrade to Economy Plus to accommodate me and my wife together. Very good take off and landing experience. What I didn't like: Fees on credit card payments which is also a foreign transaction. No vegetarian meal option. You need to pay extra before travel to order special vegetarian meal which I came to know during the flight. Only 1 movie and 1 TV Serial in Economy Class. Economy Plus is recommended for long travels.

My 16 year old son and I flew business class non-stop back and forth from Las Vegas to Frankfurt on Condor this past week and everything was great. The check-in process out of both airports was quick and the planes left on time. In the air - the flight attendants were very nice and we never had any problems. The food (in particular) was very good. The drinks cart came around all the time so my glass was never empty. The on-board entertainment was more than adequate for a 10 plus hour flight and I really liked the nearly lay-flat beds. I say nearly because they say that the beds are 170 degree flat - close enough. Anyway - before we left - I had read a number of negative reviews about Condor but honestly I didn't see anything to be concerned about. Granted we were in the higher level class of service and who knows what goes on back in coach but for the price we paid - I am more than happy and I would definitely book with them again.

Flew Condor with a group of 6 high school kids SEA-FRA. Pleasant check in staff professional cabin crew. Reasonably comfortable new interiors on B-767. Have flown with many groups on many airlines and this was one of the best experiences. Will definitely book with Condor again.

### Condor Airlines customer review
I will not be flying Condor again. We flew Frankfurt to Calgary economy seating. I have flown my fair share of budget airlines and this was by far the worst customer service I've ever received. Long story short the staff at the desk in Frankfurt were rude and condescending. My boyfriend and I were on a connecting flight and could not obtain our tickets until the gate opened before the flight. The agent refused to provide us with our boarding passes repeatedly until boarding began and all other passengers had received their boarding passes. Evidently they had either purposely or mistakenly changed our seats to be completely separate from each other and made it impossible for us to try to change this. No apology was received for this mix-up and she actually had the nerve to accuse us of being negligent in checking with her that day. Appalling service. Plane itself was basic as well as all other inflight services.

Frankfurt to Anchorage Boeing 767-300. After reading all the reviews I was quite worried but I was glad to find that there was no reason to. The cabin has been completely refurbished every seat is equipped with a screen. The entertainment program is €7 plus €3.50 if you do not bring your own headphones. 1 movie and 1 episode of a TV series are free and so is the extensive audio program. The staff was friendly and attentive. We all had a bottle of water in our seat pockets and drinks (water and juice) were offered throughout the flight. We got two meals a lunch and a snack - ordinary airline food but it was ok. Soft drinks and coffee/tea were free in Economy you had to pay for alcoholic drinks. I would definitely fly Condor again.

### Condor Airlines customer review
I flew with Condor for the first time today from SEA-FRA with a connecting flight onto AMS (via Lufthansa). I only booked my flight 3 weeks prior. My one-way ticket with Condor was less than half of other direct flights to AMS. I had read some less than favorable reviews of Condor so my expectations weren't high but given the cost savings I was willing to be open-minded! I did pay the extra fees to select my husband and my seat online check- in was smooth and there was no hassle with bringing my rolling suitcase and backpack as carry-on luggage. There was a minor delay at departure but the pilot made up the time so no worries. My first impression once getting on-board was that it was a very new plane state-of-the-art entertainment system and comfortable almost "bucket style" seats. Granted they didn't recline very far but hey it's still economy! The flight attendants were polite and friendly (though they did mix up my drink order) the food was pretty good but the beer was warm and tasted terrible! The options for the entertainment system looked good but at €7 and considering I was exhausted I didn't bother using it. Overall this was the easiest and most pleasant longhaul flight I've taken and I will definitely look at Condor for any upcoming travel plans to Europe!

I read a lot of reviews about Condor and was hesitant about using them for my travel. I was pleasantly surprised when I sat foot on their 767. The aircraft interior was newly renovated very clean. The slimline seats were some of the most comfortable I have sat on. I usually don't like these since they lack padding. 11 hour flight was ok. They served drinks about 5 times more than any US carrier across the Atlantic. There was lunch and snacks at the beginning and the end of the flight. Nothing gourmet but it was tasty and filling. Their inflight entertainment offered a lot of options for 7 EUR but I opted to read a big book instead. All the seats had a big screen TV at the back of the seat. I will use them again.

Condor Boeing 757-300 from Dusseldorf to Jerrez in Spain. Check in was quick but then it got worse. Flight late due to late arrival of aircraft - just 30 minutes so no problem. Boarded plane with bus transfer at the aircraft we waited 15 minutes before the door opened then 1 hour on the plane. Crew said that the bags of the arrival flight were still in the plane due to a lack of staff so after that they would load our bags. But we saw the staff sitting on the tarmac. Inflight we were served a snack a bun with cheese or salami with cream cheese spread but we have a lactose intolerance so no food for us. Our travel agent and the booking was informed of that. Only coffee and water for free the rest you have to buy.

End of May Vancouver to Frankfurt. I was not expecting much after reading some of the reviews. After experiencing Condor myself I did not see anything wrong. Nothing unusual at the check-in absolutely no Condor staff checked the carry-on bags for overweight and friendly as supposed to be. There were two meals on board and plenty of non- alcoholic complementary drinks. Every seat had its own entertainment monitor but not much movie selection. Only one thing caught my attention. One passenger had problems finding a space for her carry on. Flight attendant No.1 said that she cannot do much about it and proceeded on what she was doing. Another flight attendant No.2 was caught up in a discussion with the passenger but the problem did not seem to be solved until a while later. I had a sense that the flight attendants were somewhat poorly trained. I had similar experiences on United airlines but here the flight attendants solved the problem quickly without arguing with the passenger.

Dec 2013 FRA-CPT. First off its a budget long-haul carrier so don't expect any frills or the usual treatment you'd normally get from a "mainstream" carrier. Think EasyJet with a bit more leg-room and a few options and you start to get the picture. I was actually pleasantly surprised the check-in process was easy the transfer at Frankfurt was effortless and the flight itself was comfortable. You do have to pay for all the extras beverages water etc and you do need to upgrade your IFE if you do not have an electonic device to keep you occupied. I didn't bother the seat had a USB port so all I did was plug in and use my phone to keep me entertained. For what it is - it's not that bad. If you're more concerned with getting to your destination rather than the "fluffy" stuff inbetween then you can't go wrong. You get what you pay for in the end. For me they got me to where I needed to go and they did so comfortably and in good time. They don't pretend to be something they're not they are a no-frills long haul budget airline.

I flew from Vancouver to Frankfurt. Condor Airlines once OK have over the years became unfortunately a second class airline. Service inflight and at the airport is substandard and very inefficient: staff at check-in counter were rude unprofessional and poorly trained. An airline to be avoided.

I recently flew from Las Vegas to Frankfurt and I have to say that I was very pleased with the service offered onboard. The crew were nice and always asked if I needed anything. The food was good and the entertainment as well. Too bad they don't offer in-flight WiFi.

FRA-CPT-FRA. Both flights in their refurbished 767 Condor Business Class former Comfort Class. Booked Condor as it's the only airline offering a non-stop service Frankfurt - Cape Town. New cabin looks state-of-the-art. The 170-degree lie flat seats and the new IFE both are a great improvement compared to the cabin before. Very small amenity kit. Just the basics: Toothbrush and paste mask socks and earplugs not even a lotion. But packed in a foldable bottle cooler nice idea. Catering was so-so. Had beef on both flights tough meat every time. About punctuality nothing to complain about both flights arrived some 10 mins ahead of schedule. The friendliness and attention of the crew was outstanding and deserves a special appreciation. Would definitely choose them more often to CPT if they were a member of either oneworld or Star Alliance unfortunately you can't collect any tier/status miles on Condor flights just Miles and More award miles. Otherwise thumbs up for their new Business Class product!

I was travelling from VCE to Phuket through Frankfurt on 10 December 2013 with my 19 month old daughter and my husband. For such a long flight we got only one plate of pasta with pesto each and a very poor breakfast. A couple of bottles of water and that's it. We fly every year and have done for 10 years with other companies to Phuket and have never experienced something like this. I asked for a seat at the in front to be able to arrange a bassinet for my baby to sleep but they refused my request. I asked for food for my baby but I was told I had to bring it from home. I have my flight back to Venice next week and I am already looking forward to it being over. Headsets were sold to passengers but after one hour the entertainment program was interrupted because it was out of order! I would never recommend Condor!

### Condor Airlines customer review
We travelled in January with Condor from FRA to CUN. Due to critical opinions on this airline we were sceptical about our flight. Fortunately it turned out to be one of the most enjoyable flights we have had. The check-in and boarding were fast and smooth. We flew in Premium Economy which offered us generous legroom and very good seat comfort excellent food and beverages as well as travel kit incl. couple of gadgets like socks tooth brush and paste etc. The only complaint regards lack of IFE. Unfortunately our B767 was not one of their refurbished machines so we had to watch movies on overhead monitors. However the renovation of their B767s should be completed soon so if we fly with Condor on long haul again we hope to take advantage of refurbished interior.

Jan 1st 2014 from Munich to Las Palmas de Gran Canaria on an A320 almost fully booked. Check-in was slow but I gave myself enough time at the airport in MUC. On New Years day Munich airport was relaxed and quiet. The flight was wonderful. An excellent crew came with two rounds of free champagne to celebrate new year during the full hot meal service on this 3 hour flight. Food was tasty and even more quantity than American carriers across the Atlantic serve and of better quality. This is a low cost carrier. Carry on weight was checked during check-in with an efficient staff. Condor is by far better than some counterparts. Passengers need to stop whining about carry-on rules; remember you packed your bag not the airline.

### Condor Airlines customer review
I recently flew from Las Vegas to Frankfurt and back. The check-in process in Las Vegas was quick and smooth. I usually fly Economy Plus on United so I opted for Condor's Premium Economy Class and must say - its definitely worth the extra money. Not only did I get more legroom but I also got one of these amenity kits that you usually get in business class. How nice. The crew were kind and nice and frequently offered beverages during the flight (on both flights). The cabin must have been refurbished lately. The seats seemed new and all passengers had their own TV screen incl. USB charger. Food was ok but I'm a picky eater anyway.

### Condor Airlines customer review
The worst flight I have ever had. Me and my husband booked a flight with Condor (Frankfurt - Cancun - Frankfurt December-January 2013). The staff at the check-in desk were rude and helpless. Seats on the plane were very uncomfortable. Will never fly with them again and will never recommend.

### Condor Airlines customer review
Flew Cancun-Frankfurt in January 2014. Have very little to complain about. Food staff attitude price seats - all was at par. The only drawbacks were a slow check-in (an hour) and that onboard entertainment is old school overhead TV's (so bring your own).

### Condor Airlines customer review
We flew economy from Puerto Rico to Germany and back (14/12/13-11/1/14). On the San Juan-Frankfurt flight the entertainment was outdated but on the way back we had TVs on the back of the seat in front of us which for a 7-euro fee made the 10-hour flight tolerable. Very nice if it were free since most of the movies and TV shows dated from 3-10 years back. Regarding space it is minimal but since my husband and I are on the small side not unpleasant. The meals are about average for long-haul flights as are amenities like pillows and blankets. The flight attendants are more chipper than average. Regarding the baggage requirements. If you look on the internet for passenger opinions and if you scrutinize Condor’s policies you will notice that they state a 50-lb weight limit for the one checked-in suitcase and 13 lbs for the carry on. We pre-weighed and triple-times pre-weighed our check-in and carry-ons. However no one neither in San Juan nor in Frankfurt seemed to care about said limits people around us simply argued a bit at check in and overweight baggage accepted. Speaking of check-in: in Frankfurt – as noted in other reviews – it was awful. Awful in the sense that every Condor flight was checking in at the same time. Although no assistance regarding kiosk check-in was given whatsoever my impression was that checking in through a kiosk may be a better way to go. What is the benefit of having passengers (like us) who arrive over two hours ahead and are freaked-out by the extraordinary line: blood pressure rises worries escalate while reading the 45-minute-to-the-counter signs with no one to guide or help out. Can Condor improve their Frankfurt in-airport service? My last comment is that the fare was not that great. We have flown other airlines at economy for less and received more.

### Condor Airlines customer review
FRA-Funchal-FRA in EcoPlus back in Eco. After reading all these negative comments I had zero expectations but was positively surprised. We left an hour late due to a technical problem but the cheerful ground crew gave lots of information and told passengers exactly at what time the delayed flight would board. On board a friendly crew with good service (considering it is a charter airline) warm meal and sufficient drinks. The seating comfort was much better than expected. Although I am tall I had a comfortable flight. Similar experience on return this time flight spot on time. Will use them again.

DE 6229 Cape Town to Frankfurt 1 December 2013 Seats: 31 D and E. We had high expectations from this airline because of it being a direct flight and the time it would save us. The first problem was with the on-line check in. We with our travel agent tried many times during the 24 hours before the flight with no success. We checked in 3 hours before the flight and could only secure 2 seats in the middle block. We were squashed with less leg room than in all of the many planes we flew in the past for nearly 12 years. It was extremely uncomfortable. This flight was the very first long distance international flight where we had to pay for alcoholic drinks. When the main meal was served (curry chicken) which my wife may not eat she asked for a possible alternative. The stewardess was very rude and replied that in the economy class you must accept what is served you don't get any choices. Why should economy class passengers which is the bulk of your business seen as inferior to the others. Your entertainment system is outdated and very basic and leaves you no personal choice of films and added to this that you even have the audacity to charge for the headset. We received none of the much appreciated extras as routinely supplied by your competitors that may improve your flight like earplugs toothbrush etc. Except for the return flight which leaves us no alternative you can be sure that we will never fly with them again.

### Condor Airlines customer review
My husband and I travel extensively all over the world. We consider ourselves seasoned travelers. Our flight departed from Anchorage to Istanbul without incident. We sat in Economy comfortable seats attentive service pleasantly surprised food adequate. However our return trip from Athens Greece to Seattle was awful! Lufthansa agents in Athens extremely rude and unwilling to help us with connections to both Seattle and Frankfurt via Condor. Upon arrival in Frankfurt Condor agent appeared disinterested and borderline hostile that we were disturbing her. Flight from Frankfurt delayed 3 hours due to mechanical issues. No accommodations at the gate other than two vending machines thus one would have to go through security again should you wish to eat something more than junk food. Once plane was "repaired" all passengers had to leave the gate and have their tickets re- scanned for the same gate and same aircraft. One gate agent attempted to perform this task for approx. 100 passengers. Once aboard service did not begin for almost 2 hours. Service began with a mini-Snickers bar no water. Once the beverage service began we were offered water Fanta or Coke. No ice so everything was room temperature. Our male flight attendant said we could have an adult beverage at no cost so I asked for red wine and my husband asked for a Jack Daniels and sprite. To our surprise he did not know what red wine was! Additionally my husband was denied his order and told he could have either wine or a gin and tonic. Dinner while free of charge was pretty awful pasta with some sort of sauce and coleslaw. The bread and cheese accompaniment was good. During the evening hours a different flight attendant would come by with a water bottle in one hand and cups in the other waving them over the heads of passengers while sprinting down the aisle. Two hours prior to landing in Seattle we were offered breakfast and a beverage. We asked for coffee and were told by our inept male attendant that none was available but we would find it available at the Seattle airport. We are not sure what the breakfast meal consisted of it was cold and inedible. Bottom line yes you get what you pay for but it does not explain the contrasting difference between the service we experienced leaving the states to that of returning to the states. We will never fly Condor again.

My wife and I traveled (round-trip) from Halifax NS to Frankfurt and a connecting flight to Budapest Hungary. The ticketing was quick and easy (2 minutes). Boarding was also easy and the same as any other flight organized by row etc. It was $1000 cheaper than any other airline. It left on time. It was a standard Boeing 767-300 with standard seat sizes. The meal was pasta and tomato sauce which was hot and tasty but it was airline food. The staff were very cordial and friendly. I would fly Condor again and probably will.

### Condor Airlines customer review
This airline is very difficult to find in the airport at Frankfurt. Although I checked in online they did not honor the seat selection and our boarding passes printed out with different seats 13 rows apart from each other. The ticket agents are rude and refuse to help change the seats each one claiming a different colleague who is arriving at an unknown time in the future is the only one who can handle our request. Stay away from this airline it is not worth the hassle.

### Condor Airlines customer review
My wife and I always travel business class on international flights and thought this was what we were purchasing when we bought "Comfort Class" tickets however the only relationship their "Comfort Class" has to business class is that you are able to use the business class lounges. Our check in was off in the corner of the airport no priority check in for "Comfort Class" and the line was almost an hour long. In the boarding area we were paged by name and the agent took our four tickets ripped them up then reissued three tickets. I returned to the desk and asked for the missing ticket and the agent tore up the three tickets and reissued four tickets. When I returned to my wife she reviewed them and noted we now had three tickets and a duplicate. I returned to the desk and again the agent tore up the four tickets and issued four appropriate ones. The boarding time came and went and we all continued to stand around. Eventually we boarded then sat for an hour at the gate. The flight subsequently made up almost all of the time. The plane didn't appear clean. Upon boarding we realized our seats were very uncomfortable and clearly weren't comparable to business class seats with other airlines. The seats are hard and have no lumbar support. There is perhaps an extra inch or an inch and a half more width than coach class. These seats don't lie flat or come close to it. The only entertainment was from small screens on the forward bulkheads. The cabin attendants were very pleasant and the food was well prepared. The organization of the return flight was just as big a mess as the initial flight. The gates were way off on their own and although coming from a connecting flight we had to again pass security. Condor agents finally showed up. There were no announcements but they manned 3 desk positions the boarding position and also had a woman who wandered back and forth behind the desk becoming involved in some passenger details. We were in a long line to board but when it was our turn we were directed back to one of the desk positions to show our passports again. We waited in the long line to show our passports and then the agent directed us back to the long line waiting to board. Finally we boarded this time the plane was clean but the seats were just as uncomfortable as on our initial flight. Once again the cabin attendants were quite pleasant. They gave us food frequently and it was always good. We will never use this airline again.

Salvador - Frankfurt 29th September 2013. Flight DE 7077. The rudest airline staff I've encountered. We were travelling with four children under 5 the youngest two are twins and my husband and I had one each on our laps. First the host rolled his eyes and pursed his lips every time he rushed past us in the aisle and the children were hampering his progress. Given the size of the seats (my knees pressed the seat in front) it is normal for toddlers to stand in the aisles from time to time and he had his knickers in a knot about it even though they were promptly moved aside for him to pass. That said I couldn't understand why he might have been hurrying as customer service was zero. My son spilt water on his seat and the hosts would not give us a towel or serviette to dry the seat and so we had to sit on a wet seat for 10 hours. They would not let us change our babies into pyjamas in our seats but would also not let us go to the toilets to change them telling us we needed to wait for the seatbelt sign to go off - and it remained lit for 3 hours. I ended up very upset and having words with them about their extremely poor attitude; they said we had no legitimate complaints as "no one else was complaining" and it was our problem for travelling with four children (who I might add were good as gold and didn't cry once the whole time). In short travelling with a family was a nightmare on this airline and not on account of the children - I have taken more than 40 flights with my children and we have never experienced such rude obstructive and lazy hosts. We will never - never - fly with them again.

Vienna to Frankfurt (Lufthansa) Frankfurt-Washington D.C. (Condor). Upon arrival to Frankfurt the departure screen showed my Condor flight 2 hours delayed. I arrived at the new departure time and we were called to board except we didn't actually board we were just moved into a small room near the gate. As soon as the last person presented their ticket an announcement was made "the flight is delayed we have no information. I asked the gate agent simply if the plane was in Frankfurt or still on the way from another destination. She replied "we have no idea. An hour later I called customer service to inquire about other flight options since I had a meeting the following day. Customer service said they could do nothing and that I should write a formal letter of complaint which didn't solve my immediate problem of getting to Washington. At this point the flight was 5.5 hours late. I asked for my bags to be returned and called Lufthansa to arrange a flight the following day. I then waited 2 hours for my bag. I will never fly with Condor again.

### Condor Airlines customer review
Milan from BWI. I experienced some of the negative points other reviewers had pointed out. My worst experience traveling with Condor was their strict requirement for how much your carry on must weigh and their lack of communication with their partner airlines (Lufthansa in my case) where I checked in luggage. I checked in at Milan Airport on Lufthansa to Frankfurt and then to BWI on Condor operated flight. The gentleman at the Lufthansa counter checked-in my bag to BWI without weighing it. When I tried to board the Condor flight in Frankfurt I faced two rigid ladies who were asking passengers to weigh their carry on and empty them to less than 6 kilograms or pay 100 Euros to check them in. Interestingly this was happening only with these two ladies the other line checking in with another agent did not have to do this. When we got onboard the majority of the luggage compartments were empty. Another awful point relates to the inflight entertainment. On a long flight of about 10 hours from BWI to Frankfurt the only entertainment was a small video screen showing a movie of their choice. We even had to pay $5 for a a pair of headphones. Ironically the same movie was being shown on the way back from Europe! Regarding flight timeliness our flight had a 5-6 hours of delay after we had check-in at the gate. We had to wait for another plane to arrive as our plane had mechanical problems.

### Condor Airlines customer review
I had a round trip from Santo Domingo to Vienna. The low price almost makes up for the short comings of the service. It's not all Condor's fault though. I booked through Travelocity and Condor would not allow me to directly upgrade or reserve seats. They referred me back to Travelocity and Travelocity said they couldn't do anything go through Condor. The limits on baggage weight are a mixed blessing as there wasn't a big hassle loading the plane with filled overhead compartments. Check your carry on weight as you check your luggage so you don't have to pay extra when at the gate as I saw several other pax doing. I appreciated the rule much more during the trip than before the trip. I had read about the advantages of the Premium Economy and Comfort class and I believe it would be worth it but I was comfortable in my aisle seat in Economy and I'm over 6' tall. I can imagine others that wouldn't be. On board the service was exceptional in comparison to the price I paid. The food was better than most airline meals I've had in the past few years. If you're flying on business I'd recommend a different carrier though. Another issue is that the Condor hub at Frankfurt is in Halle C so it's a long jog from the feeder Lufthansa flights and another security screening. Part of the low price is that the pre-flight services are minimum. They don't start processing for a flight until immediately before it departs. As far as the entertainment my iPad had more than 75% of its charge when I arrived as the inflight system was interesting enough though really dated.

### Condor Airlines customer review
Condor started direct service to Seattle 2 years ago. In that time one would expect that this no-frills partner of Lufthansa would have corrected some of the service and comfort complaints. Not so - although I booked well ahead (in Feb.) for a July flight booking took place in Germany. As a native speaker that was no problem for me but American tourists take note. Check-in was fine and the SEA staff very helpful. Once we got seated in the waiting area a Condor employee kept snooping around looking for over-stuffed and probably over-weight carry-ons. The long flight on an older-model 767 was uncomfortable. Tight seating poor air supply (no separate air vents) cabin heat and tiny old-fashioned TV screens. These were outdone by what must be the worst airline food we have ever been served! Personnel would pass out little 4 oz cups of water or soft drinks from time to time sometimes with a tiny ice cube quickly melting. Beer as I quickly learned was 3 Euro and you got a tepid small can. We bulked up for the return flight - brought food along. Check-in at Frankfurt terminal was a silly circus of having to line up showing the boarding pass and then lining up a second time at the other counter doing the same thing. This time the 767 was a newer version with adequate TV more legroom and adequate temperate conditions. The food and drink however was even worse! One reason I chose Condor was the price as compared with other airlines. Although the cabin staff were very professional I cannot recommend this airline for its food and lack of comfort.

Flight back from Seattle to Frankfurt in Comfort - Business Class not Economy Plus. Plane was not full so I had two seats for myself which was great. As stated below the old reclining seat - no lie flat - are out of state- of-the-art but still quite comfortable so I got a good night sleep. The Lufthansa angled lie flat Business class (not the brand new one which is real lie-flat but not installed in all planes) did not give me a better experience. Food good as I often experienced not so good as when you leave Frankfurt but comparable to much more expensive airlines. Staff very nice and helpful a really good experience. Flight was in time and good. Entertainment system worked but outdated drop down TV but you can get your own DVD player in C-Class but only 4 uninteresting films. Preferred to sleep. When arriving at the baggage carousel my bag was already there (not so in Vancouver). I booked 1 day before I flew at half the price of British Iberia Lufthansa so it was very good value for the money. Will fly Condor again.

Condor Business Class is about 50 % of the Business fare of the normal Airlines and I booked 1 day before! Food superb better than many regular scheduled Airlines absolutely comparable to LH. Crew very friendly and nice. Toilets kept clean. Nice Details a rose for each passenger. Inflight Entertainment average you can order a personal DVD player.

Understand the rules and the process before you get to the airport to eliminate unpleasant surprises. We knew the strict weight restrictions for checked luggage and carry on items so there was no problem. Flying non-stop from Seattle to Frankfurt on a 767 in economy was 10 hours long with 2 edible meals and 3 second rate movies. We could have chosen to upgrade but knowing exactly what to expect we opted to use the money saved in Europe instead of getting a better airline dining experience and 16 cm of more legroom. If you need maximum creature comforts upgrade or chose a different airline. If you like to save. Money for more important things this may be the airline for you. We were satisfied arriving on time both coming and going.

ANC-FRA Boeing 767. Flight good and on time but comfort and food awful. Overnight flight with no personal lighting meant cabin was very dark and I could not read at all for most of the flight. Main meal served was one of the worse I've ever had. No choice just pasta with dried and pretty solid tomato sauce.

Will never fly with them again. Check in took over 2.5 hours we arrived early huge lines but kept getting bumped out of line as they had to take other passengers who waltzed in late. They would pull them to the front of the line. They did this with 4 flights ahead of us. Hold you in a small lounge in Frankfurt like cattle no air- conditioning boarding is chaotic free for all. Seats terrible narrow and no leg room jammed in like sardines.

### Condor Airlines customer review
Frankfurt to Toronto on July 29 2013. DE1060. We arrived at our destination. Aside from that this airline caused us great frustration at every turn: (1) My wife and I were given incorrect directions and made to wait in unnecessary lines at our transfer. (2) They split up our seats so we could not sit together. (3) They lost our luggage. (4) They botched our missing luggage report. (5) Provided absurdly poor customer service whenever we tried to get help. Air travel is a complicated service and I expect that things will go wrong sometimes. The most important thing for me is how an airline deals with a problem when it arises. I have flown dozens of airlines all around the world and I can honestly say that Condor has been the worst by far. I would not recommend flying with them.

### Condor Airlines customer review
Chose Condor as alternative from Frankfurt into Washington DC via Baltimore instead of Dulles - this is a draw: Baltimore is a smaller and nicer airport but Wash-Baltimore Pkwy has very heavy traffic so 1.5 hrs can be expected Dulles is 0.5h. Booked however because Condor operates B767 which I like better for 2-3-2 seating than B747/777 3-4-3 seating of LH/UA. However seats were awfully cramped legroom merely existing seats not comfortable. Restrooms extremely small few. Flight-Entertainment very poor: TV screens in aisle in poor quality no indiv. screens providing itinerary info for those interested. Food was given no choice but was ok. Flight attendants in first leg were attentive friendly and competent. In second leg however almost harsh. However this leg was packed with difficult pax (tourists many crying babies) so service was certainly not easy for FAs. Yet they were harsh in asking shades be put down in even in full night though light was kept on. Which was a blast because lights didn't need to be kept on for such a long time which drove the many babies mad so the overall unrest increased. Then again the crew were doing a great job with the kids patient. First leg was late on takeoff but caught well up second leg was ahead of time pilots provided a very calm ride. All in all I guess Condor is a classic case of you-get-what-you-pay for and the difference in price is rather marginal than substantial especially destination airport taken into in consideration. Condor seems generally ok but remember they are carrying tourists no frequent flyers so mood/atmosphere differ quite from carriers more business orientated.

Frankfurt to Havana. Picked Condor as approx. $1000 p/p cheaper than flying Air France. Seated in Premium Economy for minimal extra cost. Well worth it for the leg room. Flight Attendant was fantastic. Entertainment was old drop down TV but that wasn't a problem as slept and read. Food and beverages plentiful and served at regular intervals on our 11 hr flight. If flying with them they are very strict on stored and cabin luggage weight which we think is great as people bring on far too much cabin luggage. We witnessed many people having to re-pack or pay the excess fee which is very expensive. This problem is well documented on reviews so we were well aware of this before we booked with Condor so had no problems at all. Condor was very helpful with obtaining our Visa for Cuba which we purchased at their counter at check-in time. Check-in desk was easy to find at the Frankfurt airport after arriving by train. Would not hesitate to fly with Condor again.

### Condor Airlines customer review
LAS-FRA paid for a sector with Lufthansa onward to my final destination of London when I booked hassle-free on the airline's own site. Check-in at McCarran's new terminal was very pleasant - German ground staff helped me through the process of using one of their automated kiosks then directed me to a counter to pay $100 for my second suitcase. Whilst doing so the agent moved me into an exit row window which was greatly appreciated. After gambling away my last $20 on poker machines at the gate boarding was efficient with zones strictly enforced. Taxied for ages to a far runway while other planes that pushed after us took off without delay from the main runway. Initial ride was bumpy as we climbed over the desert but clear and confident bilingual announcements from the cockpit assuaged even the most nervous flyer's concerns. Dinner was fairly light but enough to satisfy. No seatback entertainment just a kid's movie on the TV monitors above the aisles but I was happy to read and enjoy the view outside. Unfortunately the otherwise-friendly crew were hysterically overzealous about passengers closing window blinds one even reaching across and slamming it shut just inches away from my nose as I enjoyed the sunset. In the end I literally had to tell one to calm down and that I promised to close it before falling asleep which I eventually did. Possibly helped by the extra legroom in the exit row I was very comfortable thanks to the complimentary blanket and pillow. I awoke to a small breakfast snack and drink and before we landed in the rain at FRA on time and disembarked at a remote bussing stand the crew announced the departure gates for Lufthansa flights all over Europe and the Middle East. Lufthansa may no longer own Condor (the tail says "Thomas Cook") but obviously still have close relations which is very beneficial to the customer - my connection (and that of my two suitcases) to my London flight was seamless. For a leisure airline this was an excellent experience and I will go out of my way to fly them again.

Seattle WA to Frankfurt Germany - SEA was confusing it was difficult to find the Condor desk - but once we did it was a smooth process. SEA is always difficult and for that reason I avoid flying in and out of SEA preferring PDX. Anyway the Condor flight was just fine - because of reviews I had anticipated difficulty with size of seats storing carry on food/beverage service. But it was a smooth flight kind and attentive attendants food was very good (surprisingly) beverage service fine - though no coffee refills. All was well for a 10.5 hour flight. Luggage was available almost immediately and customs processing in Frankfurt was very smooth. Same with the return trip - and because we took a train into the FRA airport we could check our baggage in with the new air/rail check in service . I will definitely fly with Condor AIR again - good value!

Flew out of Frankfurt into Calgary. Flight delayed 2.5 hours. Food is not nice at all. Entertainment is a joke and you are made to pay for earphones. You get the first drink for free and then must pay after that. Seats are a bit firm anad there is not much space between each seat. The staff were generally nice enough. I have to fly with them again as I am returning to Europe but I am not looking forward to it.

I've just embarked my daughter in Calgary for flight to Frankfurt DE 3095. Arrived at Calgary 2 hours before departure and found a long line for check-in. We had tried to check online but the site didn't work. Spent 1 hr in line when we finally reached the desk the luggage exceed the weight by 2 kilos. We asked the attendant to leave us few minutes to take out something from luggage but after 5 minute she came and told us that they need to close the check-in and if we haven't finish we must pay $130. So we had to pay. I was in touch with my daughter close to plane taking-off and the flight was delayed 10 minutes. I don't understand why the check-in was closed early. My daughter told that space between seats was very tight and front seat didn't had a monitor as for a long flight. I am expecting her landing in Frankfurt and I will come back with more information.

Las Vegas to Frankfurt April 2013 Premium Economy. I had a rather pleasant experience with Condor something much better than I had expected. The seats were comfortable despite the lack of a headrest and had adequate legroom. Seating arrangement is 2-3-2 which is best when traveling with family. There is no barrier separating Premium Economy with Economy but this was no problem. As far as food all options in the menu card were of meat or fish so it was a good choice in selecting vegetarian meals for us. Our preferred meals arrived and were more than sufficient; lots of side dishes and snacks accompanied the main course. The flight attendants were friendly and I had no problems with them. Entertainment: there are overhead screens in all cabins and the film selection was decent coming in both German and English. Overall I enjoyed my 10hr flight with Condor and would definitely fly them again.

### Condor Airlines customer review
First and last flight with Condor Frankfurt-Salvador! 2 hour delay no Condor staff at the airport/transfer desk - only available over the phone! Customer Service hung up on me twice and didn't even think it was necessary to apologize for the delay. Moreover the airplane staff were unfriendly the plane was old (no TV) and limited in terms of space. The price I paid would have been the same for a different airline. The only reason I was obliged to choose Condor was because no other airline offers this direct flight from FRA to SSA!

FRA-MBA return. Flight was 12hrs delayed due to problems with the plane. Were brought to nearby hotel with shuttles. Got all the information we asked for. Flight was ok staff friendly legroom astonishingly spacious for a charter. No personal IFE though. Food nothing special. Return without any problems or delays.

Vancouver to Frankfurt. Generally pleased with the overall experience. Flight back to Vancouver from Frankfurt turn into a nightmare as we were connecting from Rome we got off at Frankfurt and proceeded to the Condor gate at 1.30 pm got to the gate at 2pm and there was a long line-up. After that line we had to line up again for the security. When we finally got to the gate we found the Condor agents were weighing everyone's carry on baggage for the 6 kilo limit and if over the cost was 20 Euro per kilo. There were 3 of us travelling together and combined we were 11 kilos over as we had purchased some duty free items. The agent grabbed our boarding pass and refused to give it back to us unless we paid the 220 Euros for the 11 kilos of overweight carry on. We felt so trapped so we paid. Never again.

DE6120 Frankfurt - San Juan (Puerto Rico) on June 8th 2013. Good service and nice staff. Toilets kept clean. Both meals were ok for that price in Economy Class. I was lucky that the seat next to me wasn't occupied. Otherwise it would have been hard to stand a 10 hours flight in such narrow space. Next time with Condor I'll book Premium Economy for sure mainly because of the 15 cm more.

### Condor Airlines customer review
Picked Condor because it was low cost or so I thought. You don't get to pick your seats until after you pay and then you find out you have to pay to pick your seats. I had two small carry-ons and they wanted to weigh one. The charge for being over 6 kilos on the 2nd item was 75 euros. On leaving Seattle heading for Frankfurt departure was nearly on time. As the flight occurred during the night I expected the lights would be turned off and I actually asked after a few hours when they were going to be. I was rudely told not until the flight attendants had finished selling to passengers. The flight back to Seattle was an even a longer delay plus paying extra 75 euros for a slightly over 12lbs 2nd carry-on. All communications on the plane full of English speaking people was in German first then English. After flying for over 11 hours on the return flight the gate was in use so we waited 20 minutes only to have the occupying plane break down. So we moved to another gate and waited another 15 minutes for their ground staff to relocate before we were allowed off of the plane. You could not pay me to fly on this airline again.

### Condor Airlines customer review
Flew round trip Las Vegas to Frankfurt Germany. Pretty much everything that can go wrong went wrong. Seats are completely inadequate for international flights. Very little leg room no amenities to charge devices and no interactive entertainment. They did not have my non dairy meal and rather than own up to it they said it was my fault and that I was supposed to pay for that. I've never been asked to pay for a meal to be dairy free when otherwise free. Condor never posts their gate info until the last minute leaving you sitting outside security like I am doing right now waiting for my delayed flight to be assigned a gate.

### Condor Airlines customer review
Keeping in mind the old expression "you get what you pay for" I booked one way SEA-AMS in Condor's Comfort Class. At only USD $1659 it was $900 cheaper than the next lowest fare on Icelandair (FI). Check-in was smooth and quick with a dedicated counter boarding was efficient an on time push back from the gate. Cabin interior was pleasant and the seats though limited in the degree of recline were wide and comfortable. A full dinner and breakfast service was served with choices made from the menus that were distributed by the friendly and professional flight attendants. The food was actually better than most first class meals I've had on domestic US carriers. Condor uses a live stream that allows passengers to view movies and other programming on their own computer tablet or smart phone. There are also digi players available at no charge for those passengers traveling without their electronic devices. I like the fact that I was able to use the business class LH lounge in FRA while awaiting my connecting LH mainline flight into AMS. Put aside all the negative reviews of Condor and book their business class cabin without trepidation. It really is a good product at a reasonable price.

### Condor Airlines customer review
I flew on Condor 4049 from Seattle to Frankfurt. It had very hard seats I could not sleep and the overhead entertainment was not ideal for a 12 hour flight. I was surprised how friendly the flight attendants were. The food was very good better than I was expecting. I would recommend Condor if you don't care about hard seats or poor entertainment. I would highly recommend Condor.

### Condor Airlines customer review
Frankfurt to Havana and Punta Cana to Frankfurt: Not really bad but not good either. Quite narrow seats no personal inflight entertainment (on 10.5hr flights). Completely strange service concept: They start with a free alcoholic cocktail of your choice. But then they charge for headphones plus they charge for wine with the main dinner. Than they pass with snacks which are also for sale. First team was friendly and funny second in a bad mood. All in all - if I have the chance depending on routes I will fly another airline.

Flew from Frankfurt to Seychelles. Ground staff at FRA very unfriendly. Condor did not have a plane for the flight and had to borrow one from Thomas Cook UK. Aircraft totally unsuitable for 8 hour overnight flight - non-reclining plastic seats maybe ok for a 2 hour flight but not here. Downgraded from Premium Economy to Economy as aircraft did not have Premium Economy seats. Was told to claim back difference in price on return to Germany. Did this via Internet. No confirmation of claim from Condor. Phoned Condor and was told that claims take 6 to 8 weeks to process and they cannot even confirm that they have received the claim. Rather use Emirates or Etihad next time.

Frankfurt - San Jose Costa Rica. FA's were funny and our flights were on time. Just make sure to do your research on the rules sizes and regulations. Some people pushed in the queue when boarding however all this about stampeding onto the plane is complete rubbish. Food was okay legroom decent.

### Condor Airlines customer review
We have used Condor several times flying from Las Vegas to Frankfurt. The most recent trip was in summer 2012. Airport staff and flight attendants are nice and helpful. No more/less room than other airlines economy so I don't know why others' are expecting anymore. My husband is 6'4" and never has complaints about leg room. Return flights from Frankfurt to Las Vegas are just as nice. US Customs at the Las Vegas airport can be rude.

### Condor Airlines customer review
Because of a technical problem our plane made a stop in Munich. There it was 14.00. They couldn't serve the lunch on the flight Frankfurt-Munich but they could on ground in Munich because the time on ground was more than 1hr but they didn't so they served the lunch at 16.00! No excuse from the Captain! Cabin attendants and the seats were ok. However legroom was very small not suitable for an 2.5 hr flight. The flight was cheap so value for money was ok.

### Condor Airlines customer review
Traveled on Condor last summer from Fort Lauderdale to Frankfurt. Plane was on time and crew friendly but helpful on both lets. We didn't opt for the Economy Plus upgrade and I wish that we had. After 5 hours of a 9 hour flight the seats felt really close! Food was good though we had upgraded to the Premium meals. On the flight to Germany we had to remind them a couple of times but on the flight back they served the correct meals without having to correct them. Overall for the price it was a steal. Would not hesitate to rebook with them again (in fact planning now for summer 2014) but be sure to splurge for the upgraded seats.

### Condor Airlines customer review
Flight from FRA to YVR on Oct 20. We were told at check-in that flight would leave 2 hrs. late. Departure gate in the airport was changed - caused us some anxiety until we found our gate. In flight service from attendants is good. Efficient almost robot-like. Can't get any sleep in the seats. After 7 hours in economy class you want to get off. All in all: value for money if comfort is not first priority.

### Condor Airlines customer review
Flew Halifax - Frankfurt economy class Sep 2012. Flight was 3 hours late departing seats were rather cramped. Flight attendants helpful but meal was terrible: partially re-heated ravioli. Breakfast and In-flight entertainment ok. We missed our connecting flight to Rome and had to take a later flight. Condor staff were somewhat helpful directing us at Frankfurt but could have done better. Heard from a family member that Premium Class was much more comfortable on the return. However I'd be very hesitant to use them for a transatlantic flight again.

### Condor Airlines customer review
Vancouver to Frankfurt - 8th Sep 2012. I read the reviews before I booked and knew Condor was 'very average'. I think 'very average' is being kind to them. It was the worst flight we have ever taken. The plane was late to take off. OJ was spilt in the overhead locker above our seat by another passenger. When I asked the staff to clean it (it was leaking down onto us) they were not happy to oblige. They did a lazy job and when the plane ascended and through the remainder of the flight OJ continually leaded down on to us. Then cabin staff spilt coke on us. No apologies. Food was sloppy macaroni cheese. Inflight entertainment was an aisle monitor approx every 5 rows. The movies were preset with the 1st being in English the 2nd in German. Very old movies. Staff extremely rude. Seats uncomfortable and tight. When we arrived in Frankfurt the plane stopped a long way from the terminal and you have to be herded and crammed into a bus and transported to the terminal. If you are on a tight budget and the flight is not an enjoyable part of your holiday - then fly with Condor. But if being comfortable and the flight be a happy holiday experience - then do not fly with Condor.

Vancouver to Frankfurt 1-10-12. Frankfurt to Vancouver 13-10-12. Cabin staff on both trips exceedingly rude. Water was poured down my arm and I was told I held the cup wrongly. The food is okay but water service on return trip very poor and I can't get over how rude the cabin staff was on the trip yesterday. At one point we were told that if we wanted more comfort we should travel in a more expensive area. I was travelling from Copenhagen yesterday and in Frankfurt I was sent to 4 different stands to get a boarding pass. Condor appears to be in total chaos in Frankfurt.

### Condor Airlines customer review
Vancouver to Frankfurt and Frankfurt to Vancouver. I read the reviews prior to flying so I was at least not completely caught off guard by the shabbiness of this airline. The Vancouver to Frankfurt leg of the trip was 'ok' but Frankfurt to Vancouver is where the horns came out. The gate at Frankfurt is very disorganized and the service could not be more rude and unapologetic. I was prepared with one carry-on and a laptop. In Frankfurt be prepared to wait 2 hours in a crammed lineup at a very shabby gate even if this a connecting flight and you luggage has been previously checked in. The economy section of the plane is laughable. I'm 6'-2" so had no leg room at all. I had to sit on my side and tilt my legs towards my girlfriends space. I fell asleep once on the flight and was awoken by a food cart being slammed into my knee cap. I was offered a very brief apology. The food was edible which is the most you can say for any airline. They provide you a small bottle of water when you first get to your seat and offer ample drinks on the plane. No complaints with food or drinks. In flight entertainment is very poor. They have common outdated TV's above the left and right seating (none in the middle). Screen visibility is poor and they charge for headphones so bring your own. The movies that are played are older meaning they have been released on DVD/Blu Ray for the past few months. I would only recommend this airline for struggling families on a budget. If you are a couple with no kids or single I would suggest to book Premium Economy Class or go with another airline.

DE2067 Anchorage (Alaska) to Frankfurt 11th September 2012. At the gate everyone rushed forward as soon as the first call was made obviously desperate to board first as soon as their own class or seat row was called. It was difficult to get through the crush. The girl on the desk said "It's always like this"! Why don't they do something about it? Once on board we realised why - it was a bun fight for overhead locker space. Despite a supposed restriction of one carry-on bag some people had 3 and some were huge. Oversize bags were just left hanging out of lockers for the flight crew to sort out. It was absolute chaos and we finally took off an hour late. I thought Expedia had ordered a veggie meal for my wife as my e-ticket said it had been 'requested' but apparently this is not the same thing! The stewardess asked if I had paid for it which I hadn't so we weren't getting it. Turns out you have to pay extra for a veggie meal (or any other special diet). Never ever heard of this before on any airline ticket for which meals are included. The seats in economy were narrow and uncomfortable (impossible to sleep) the TV screens were few and very small the washrooms dirty. To top it all after disembarkation at Frankfurt we had a 20 minute bus ride to the terminal. Then we had to walk about 2 miles right across the airport and even go through security again despite being transit passengers before catching our connecting Lufthansa flight to Manchester which we only just made although the layover was nearly 2 hours. Why can't Condor/Lufhansa (both German) connections be simpler than this? The only good points were that they did make up time on the flight (lucky with the prevailing winds I guess) and they didn't lose our luggage! Oh and they were at least cheap.

On 08.23. of this year my wife and our 3-yr old daughter were supposed to be on the flight 4049 from Seattle to Frankfurt at 6.05 pm. After five hours of waiting they were told the flight was cancelled. The staff at the airport wouldn't say much more than that the passengers should call a phone number in Chicago tomorrow morning at 9 am. In five hours at the airport they were not offered a glass of water let alone a snack. That same night I called Condor's main number and asked for more information about the flight. I was told to go to the airport and ask for more info there. When I said I'd just come back from there they hung up. In the morning the Chicago number was useless. Since Condor wasn't helping I had to buy new tickets due to my wife's further travel arrangements. Buying a ticket 3 hours before the flight tends to double the cost. In the end we ended up paying an additional $1200. That was the most expensive "Condor" flight ever.

### Condor Airlines customer review
FRA-YVR Comfort Class 2 seats middle row middle aisle. The crew from the moment we boarded until the moment we departed were fantastic. Great seats lots of room. Lots of nice touches printed menus crisp linen amenity kit headsets large pillows and quilt etc. Food and wines were above average quality and the quantity goes back 20 years in airline product. In my opinion the f and b was better than both Lufthansa and KLM and I am making reference to their Business Class product. I would recommend this airline to anyone as long as they travel in the front cabin.

### Condor Airlines customer review
We arrived at the gate to find a huge queue and it took us an hour to get to the counter. When we did get there we found that Condor had substituted the plane a well worn 757 so instead of the flight we had expected and paid for this plane did not have any service differentiation and the entire plane was cramped economy. To make matters worse they had just one individual handling the tickets who had to re-ticket the entire plane. The queue was horrendous and while I was upset I also felt sorry for this young lady who had to bear the brunt of upset customers. What struck me was the indifference ”the plane has been changed here are your new tickets". No explanation no “sorry for the inconvenience” - nothing. We were herded on to a bus to be taken to the plane and when we got there the plane wasn't ready so we sat there in 36 degree heat with little or no AC for almost 25 minutes. Our seating on the plane moved from premium economy to a cramped window and middle and we sat there for almost an hour before the plane left the terminal. Once airborne the captain announced that this particular plane did not have the capability to fly direct from Frankfurt to Halifax so had to divert to Manchester and spend another hour on the ground refuelling. During that time crew suggested we stay in our seats and refrain from using the washroom unless absolutely necessary. An hour after takeoff they served the meal. By that time we had been on the plane 5 hours and during that time the only thing they had given us was a glass of water/juice. I did notice however that the crew were snacking all through this time. We arrived in Halifax about 2.5 hrs late after being on the plane for almost 10 hours. What really struck me was the indifference of the staff and crew.

We took Condor from Frankfurt to Cancun and back (10 hours flight). Economy seats are too narrow with common TV monitors (ours was not working). You have to pay to get earphones for the movies.

Vancouver Canada to Frankfurt. Hour and a half delay and the explanation was that some toilets weren't working and they couldn't fix it. I barely made my connecting flight from Frankfurt to Dubai and my luggage didn't make it I had to wait 2 days for it to be sent to Dubai. I was flying comfort class so I didn't have to join the big queues but staff at the check in counters were not friendly at all. I would not fly Condor again.

The flight from Seattle was delayed now it is Friday 12.30 noon flight still has not departed no answers as to why. Heading to a 24-hour delay? Or more? Condor had to send people to semi-local hotel for night passengers back at airport around 9.30am Friday morning and still waiting for their flight. Of course connecting flights to other destinations all missed. Ripped off at baggage check-in at Seattle one suitcase weighed 1 pound too much another 2-1/2 pounds too much cost $60 extra.

Frankfurt to San Juan Puerto Rico on a 767-300 and 9.5 hours flight. Boarding in Frankfurt is at horrible C1-C4 gates or ghetto gates of FRA Airport. Condor's computer system seems to be old and out of date since it takes a long time to add passport information. Flight was wonderful and service excellent. Flight Crew works hard and food was very good and tasty. By far better than US Carriers. Condor has a quality product and tough carry-on policy. It is the same no nonsense approach as British Airways on carry-on and it works. Seats are a little cramped in regular economy but recline very good. For the price of $350 from FRA to SJU it is above expectations.

We took Condor to Frankfurt. First of all the plane was 2.5 hours late taking off from Calgary and we missed our connection from Frankfurt. Staff not helpful at all they were sending us all over Frankfurt airport - which is another disaster. If you can help it never fly through it!

We flew from BWI to Rome via Frankfurt on August 6-7 2012. After reading reviews about Frankfurt I was worried but Condor did a great job diverting us to a bus so we could travel directly to passport control and our new gate. The layover was 1 hour and 5 minutes and the transfer took only 15 minutes. Fortunately both legs departed and arrived on schedule. The plane itself was fine. The crew was efficient and came by frequently. The only complaint is minor - the seats seem very close together in economy class. Also the TVs were in the centre aisle so it wasn't a great view for those of us on the sides. However I would recommend Condor because we didn't have any problems with the flights or the Frankfurt connection and the price was better than other airlines.

I just returned on DE 4067 from FAI to FRA and have nothing to complain about. Our flight from FRA to FAI in July was on time no checking of carry-ons at the gate easy boarding and overall a wonderful flight. The cabin crew were very nice professional and helpful. I am 1.95 m (6'3") and book Premium Economy to have more room - and it is worth the money. Sure the food is typical airline fair but it's edible. Our return today from Fairbanks was on time and fast.

Halifax to Frankfurt return. Late leaving Halifax by 2 hours but the worse thing was that Condor had us on the plane for over an hour with no air conditioning and no information. We missed our connecting flight to Amsterdam. Lucky for me I have Star Alliance gold status so the rebooking with Lufthansa was easy. Return flight was a disaster. Again 2 hours late. We couldn't get checked in through Lufthansa out of Budapest. Frankfurt check-in was an awful experience with long lines and little information. The seats are small and the entertainment system is prehistoric. Condor overbooks its flights so there is a fight to get someone to miss their flight. The passenger waiting areas were crowded and poorly organized. The return flight included two passengers conducting their own personal "rave" on board. No one spoke to them or seemed concerned. While you can save some money flying Condor I question whether the savings are real or even worth the hassle.

We just got back from our trip to Europe flying Condor to Frankfurt. The troubles started at check-in at Calgary Airport when my family of 4 was booked separately. Finally they sorted it out but the flight was 2.5 hours late taking off and we missed our connecting flight in Frankfurt. There Condor staff were very unhelpful told us we are now Lufthansa's problem sending us around the airport. The airplane was at least 25 years old with common TV's very narrow seats bad food and un-caring staff. I would not recommend flying with Condor at all.

Flying from Hamburg via Frankfurt to Baltimore. Spend a long time checking in was sent back and from between Condor and Lufthansa. Rude behaviour from the Condor employees. Had to stand in several lines and long waiting time in Frankfurt. Waiting rooms very crowded and dirty. Took a long time to register necessary information before boarding card could be issued. Employees seems to be unmotivated and very low skilled. Baggage was lost. Not able to track baggage due to wrong information given from representatives at the airport in Baltimore.

Very poor service. Flight from Halifax to Frankfurt took off 1 hr 40 mins later than scheduled so we missed our connecting flight in Frankfurt We had to go through clearance twice; had to wait in one long line-up to get a new ticket and then again we had to wait in even longer line-up to get a new boarding pass. When I called Condor to reserve XL seats they said no problem and they charged me 15 EUR per seat in each direction. When I got on the plane I realized that they reserved regular seats for me. I was told XL Seats cannot be reserved on long haul flights. Condor is not clear in their communication and they will charge you extra whenever they can.

FRA - Colombo at a bargain price of 230 Euros one-way and value for money. Seating is rather cramped but still manageable. They provide filling yet basic meals and one gets clean if not the most modern planes and rather efficient then charming crew. Even got LH miles credited. Their main advantage is that they fly you directly to secondary airports and exotic destinations without lengthy plane changes. Would not hesitate to travel again if the price is right.

### Condor Airlines customer review
Flew from FRA to SSA in a clean 767-300ER on 15/7/2012. I paid a little extra to fly Premium Economy and it was still comparable to the major airlines' standard economy. However had generous leg-room a great pillow (larger than usually offered) and received a kit with water full-size toothbrush toothpaste headphones eye-cover  earplugs and a small footrest was under each seat. The seat reclined well and the crew were friendly and helpful. The on-board service was a very nice surprise: great food and a reasonable variety of beverages - hot and cold. The only draw-back comparing with its competitors is the lack of individual LCD screens: they still used the old-fashioned overhead screen for each cabin sector. A good experience and would repeat given a choice! Shame that the FRA airport is a total mess: immigration was chaos and so was the security screening before the gate delaying our flight by about 15 minutes and stressing the passengers.

### Condor Airlines customer review
Flew on 767 from YVR to FRA. Worst airline I have ever flown on internationally. Seats were cramped they are older and bulkier than new seats. I'm 5'8" and had virtually no leg room and had none whatsoever when the passenger in front of me reclined her seat. I've never had worse food. Hot pasta dish was essentially chopped vegetables on top of bland and congealed pasta bread was stale. Breakfast consisted of 3 slices of citrus fruit crackers that resembled soggy bread and a couple of paper-thin slices of cheese and meat. Extra snacks and drinks were for purchase only. Headphones for IFE were also for purchase only. Only redeeming factor was that the agent at check-in counter was friendly and professional. Budget-airline-quality for not-so- budget-airline prices!

### Condor Airlines customer review
Flight from Toronto to Vienna (via Frankfurt) was about 40% less expensive than other airlines. After booking and then reading the other reviews about Condor on this website I worried that we had made a mistake. We paid an additional 15 euros per ticket each way for reserved seats since the check-in process seemed to be a common complaint in past reviews. In Toronto we waited less than 10 minutes to check-in through a friendly Condor agent. The boarding and flight was what you'd expect for any charter - perhaps a little less leg room but overall on par with Air Canada. The on-board staff were helpful and cheerful. I had requested a special meal and when they didn't have record of it they went out of their way to offer me other choices. Our experiences on the return flight were the same. My spouse was a bit disgruntled because on the return flight all alcoholic beverages were an additional charge - but not a big deal given the price to value ratio. I would be happy to fly Condor again and would recommend it to anyone who is looking to for a more affordable option to fly to Europe.

Flight from Berlin to Greece. In flight film was a current film although intended for children with a flight containing only 3 children. Breakfast was satisfactory and typical food served. Would have liked having more than 1 coffee and 1 water but the flight was only 3 hours. No issues at all with luggage.

I had the same experience as previous posters with stiffing me for excess baggage charge. Website states a $26.00 charge for excess baggage but I was charged 60 Euro. I was going to throw out a few things but the was not allowed to for security reasons which made no sense. Other passengers walked through with 2 items (I had large purse and small suitcase) and were not stopped at all. Also when checking in was told flight was overbooked and I had no seat but my daughter did! Had to wait to gate to find out if I could get on plane. Girl at check-in hinted I may get upgraded but that was not the case at the gate a very rude woman told me to take a seat then called me over to say I got a seat but my daughter and I would not be seated together. Was not able to check in online because we were US citizens and had not paid extra $$ for seat choice.

After we checked in at the desk a lady was pulling passengers aside to weigh our bags and charge us for excessive weight. Really a rip off. They charged us 320 Euros for two carry ons. It was a disgrace. She said either pay or throw your belongings away. Beware of your carry on weight. They only allow 6 kilos which is about 12 pounds and that includes the luggage weight. It was a money making machine at the gate. They made a big profit that day. Will never fly or recommend Condor again. After 9.5 hours the bathrooms had no toilet paper with urine on the floor. They should be ashamed of themselves and I paid $400 extra dollars for filth.

Premium Economy from Frankfurt to Fort Lauderdale. The bad: Check-in at Frankfurt was somewhat slow and no smiles were given during the process. Boarding was a bit delayed with no explanation given. Boarding message was very hard to understand due to lousy speaker quality. We were told to board in different stages but people ignored this and everyone went on the buses at the same time. Hand baggage limit is only 6kg which is nothing (my hand carry suitcase is fairly light but still weighs 3kgs without anything in it). Luckily this wasn't checked or enforced on this flight. The good: Flight was actually quite good. Seat on Economy Premium had plenty of leg space. I'm 1.95cm and still had 30cm of space from my knees to the seat in front of me which in my case was a wall. Seat leaned back a lot which made it somewhat comfortable to sleep something I otherwise find hard on flights in general. No individual screens but a few common screens showing comedy music and ads. On the promo clips they showed for Condor all the flight crew were young and hot (probably hired models) the real crew were old and looked like something out of an 80's movie. But the service was friendly and professional. Food was actually quite good. I've had better but I've certainly had worse as well. Overall the experience on Economy Premium was like flying on the luxury class of old low cost airline. And since the price was fairly low I would probably fly this way again.

FRA-Las Vegas. If its possible avoid it. Most importantly passengers need to be aware of unreasonably tight restrictions (1 item of less than 6 kg) on hand luggage stiff penalties for excesses (20 Euros per kg) and a policy of checking-at-the-gate by which time it is too late for passengers to re-pack their luggage. The seats don't allow much leg room and they seem a bit narrow. And have to wait long time because of their checking-at-the- gate - it takes really long time believe me!

Vancouver-Frankfurt Economy on 767-300ER with winglets - actually the most up-to-date variant of 767 I've flown including a more modern interior with curved storage bins like on newer 777 planes very well kept. Staff courteous and friendly pilots provided updates at regular intervals. Only thing I can fault like others have done is the no-frills standard of service. This includes a cramped cabin seating layout with very little leg room bland and nutritionally lacking food no personalised in-flight entertainment for a 10+ hour flight and the inability to either check in or choose seats for this flight online resulting in a long queue at the airport and luck-of-the-draw seat assignment. Overall Condor maintains a certain German quality of flight service well but it's far from flying in style. For the very cheap ticket price was worth it. Beware also of strict carry-on luggage weight allowance.

FRA-HAV in Premium Economy class. A very good product indeed. The 767-300 looked very clean and new. Seats (2-3-2) are wide and comfortable. Recline very good pitch 35". You get a footrest under the seat in front of you can be used in several ways for feet/legs and are very comfortable. A full size pillow comfort kit water Drinks are free and they start with a cocktail hour then return with drinks during meal service. Meals very nice. Menu's choice all well presented. More drinks offered during flight together with an ice- cheese-cake. Snack before landing distributed (again with drinks) a couple of hours before landing. Giving you time to eat/enjoy and somehow shortening the flight. Same concept (drinks and meals) seemed to be followed in economy class too. Crew very nice. Polite still with humour. Compared with other airlines that offer Europe-Havana flights Condor Premium is much better for more or less the same price.

Frankfurt-Cancun return. The main problem is customer service when checking in. When checking in at Cancun airport I stood 2.5 hours in the queue barely getting to my gate in time for the flight. When I finally reached the check-in counter it turned out my suitcase was over the limit for checked-in luggage. I was told I had to pay for this which is fine. What is not fine is that the operation of paying took 15 mins. Extremely ineffective and tedious check-in process. The flight itself is below comfortable entertainment is poor the food is no more than okay and leg room is nothing to write home about. But all of this would be more acceptable if the start of the journey didn't have you running through the airport because ground service is so slow.

### Condor Airlines customer review
Boeing 757 FRA-AYT Jan 2012. Airplane quite clean and young crew friendly check-in procedure professional and effective at FRA personnel at gate at least tried to board by sectors food/beverages for the 3 hour flight sufficient and quality OK - much better than competing airline that we took on the return flight. Only the seating is quite cramped in economy - in width and legroom we wouldn't have coped with a longer flight.

Vancouver to Frankfurt return. The flights themselves were probably a 7 or 8 out of 10. The food was good and the service was friendly. The seats don't allow much leg room and they seem a bit narrow but we managed. The real problem is with the Condor staff that check you in and I would give them a 1 out of 10. The web-site did not allow us to pre-select our seats from Canada so we went to the airport early so we could get window seats. We were the 2nd people in line when the wicket opened and when we asked for a window seat the woman said that they had all been assigned online. We told her that because we were the 2nd people in a line of hundreds we were hoping she might be able to switch our seats. She said no. There was no smile no apology - nothing - just a flat no. And our experience back to Canada was just as bad. It took almost 2 hours for the check-in. The lines were incredibly long and while waiting to board I must have heard six different passengers complain that they had to pay 20 Euro for each kilo their carry-on bag was over the 6kg limit. One person said that they would gladly throw out the chocolate they were bringing home for their children but were told that it was too late and they would have to pay 60 Euro penalty. And of course we were sitting in the middle section again. But the young pregnant woman sitting beside us was not even allowed to sit with her husband. They told her they would not try to find any seats together for them so she spent the 10 hour flight alone. Would I fly Condor again - not on your life! The land crew of Condor Airlines has scarred me.

Frankfurt to Salvador return comfort class. Food was pretty good attendants friendly service was good seats are pretty good as well. May not be as good as KLM business class but it's half the price. All in all a good experience.

### Condor Airlines customer review
We give Air Condor a definitive ‘thumbs down’. There were some positives (decent food and drink and reasonable leg space) but negatives dominated. Most importantly passengers need to be aware of unreasonably tight restrictions (1 item of less than 6 kilos) on hand luggage stiff penalties for excesses (20 Euros per kilo) and a policy of checking-at-the-gate by which time it is too late for passengers to re-pack their luggage. On our flight (from Frankfurt to Vancouver on 1 October) dozens of unhappy passengers were paying penalties of hundreds of dollars.

### Condor Airlines customer review
I travelled with Condor with a 1.5 year old baby as the first leg from Vancouver-Frankfurt-Prague trip. For the price the experience was good. They gave my child games and they bumped us up to Premium Economy on the return and food was fine (one free alcoholic drink is given).

Panama to Frankfurt Economy. The stewards were not really customer oriented no smile just robotic. The entertainment onboard was a couple of TV screens playing some Disney films and 2 normal movies. You can buy headphones for 3.5 EUR however many passengers did not have Euros. The quality of meal was ok but the problem appeared with the first snack - the steward simply forgot to give the snack to me and my partner. Later I asked for it and they did not even say sorry - she just told me It happened because her colleague was too fast. I know I travelled in Economy Class but still I paid enough to deserve suitable behaviour from staff.

FRA-MBA-FRA Seating in Business Class okay charter competitors are better. No personal inflight entertainment only screens on the bulkhead. Good choice of meals and a good selection of wine. Crew friendly and professional.

### Condor Airlines customer review
Flew with my 17 month old and my friend and her 6 month old daughter from Fort Lauderdale to Frankfurt and to Prague. At the airport told we could not sit together and we did book the seats together. Onboard my friend ended up sitting next to a passenger who was drunk she asked to move and was told there were no free seats. One person felt sorry for my friend and he changed seat with her. It took the attendant 2 hours to get me a water. I was very disappointed with all the service I received.

Halifax to Copenhagen via Frankfurt. Frankfurt airport is overcrowded departure gates are not posted until a few mins before boarding. The Boeing 767-300 holds over 250 passengers and there was a very long queue being passed through a pair of checkpoints to get on bus after bus plus a 15 min wait. Halifax airport was far more efficient. Onboard I found the seat so thinly padded that I sat on the head pillow. The lunch was so-so and later a snack consisting of a piece of cheese in a dry bun with beverages a while afterwards. At least Condor did provide 2 or 3 free rounds of beverages during the flight. The Condor magazine had about 70 pages of duty-free merchandise which seems like a distraction from the business of flying.

Calgary to Oslo return. Condor leg from Calgary to Frankfurt went well both ways. The 2 flights were on time. Leaving Calgary we were the third people in line so got an exit seat. Their seats have limited leg room and the seats are not wide. Meals were adequate and they serve plenty of food and drinks throughout. If you are taller and require more leg room upgrade to Comfort class.

### Condor Airlines customer review
Frankfurt-Zanzibar with a stopover in Nairobi. Condor's Business Class is not on par with other competitors but it only costs a fraction of the price. Interior was clean and crew friendly meals were alright. My only disappointment was that we were allocated new seats for the (short) Nairobi-Zanzibar leg because of some passengers disembarking and joining. I had originally chosen a window seat but found myself on an aisle seat.

### Condor Airlines customer review
Frankfurt-Calgary. Economy class was overbooked which caused chaos for seat distribution therefore at the time of departure we were still sitting at the gate waiting. On-board service was average. As it was a flight from Germany to Canada with a German company communication in German and English must be considered sufficient however many German passengers had trouble filling out the customs declaration which were only in English. Lack of information about the position of the plane and other flight data. As expected in Economy class one does not get much space but as I am not very tall and had an aisle seat it was not a problem. Anchorage-Frankfurt with stopover in Fairbanks: we left Anchorage nearly on time but had 1 hr delay in Fairbanks reportedly due to new software equipment. Flying from ANC we spent 12 hrs on board during which time we only got 2 snacks. At the gate in Anchorage there were various free newspapers but all of them were outdated and there was no recent American papers.

We flew Frankfurt to Phuket in an outdated and badly maintained 767. The Food was meagre service was poor with no drinks served between meals. My Seat was damaged so it could not be reclined. On the return there was a stop over in Bahrain. There was a problem causing the aircraft to be grounded. It took hours before we were transferred to a hotel.

I had a great flight. I got bumped up to Premium Economy class the airplane was clean and new. The stewards were very professional. The food was great! the fed us 4 times! One snack on arrival 3 times with the drink cart 2 meals and a farewell snack. I've never reviewed before so that proves how much I loved flying.

Flight AYT-DUS with 1 hr delay at take-off and 40 min delay at landing - nothing displayed at airport! No reasons told at airport - finally get an explanation on board. But from the reception until the end of the trip no single word form Captain or cabin staff that they regret the delay or wishing no further inconveniences - felt like cattle. Some cabin staff ok - some others like at a market (walking through the plane and screaming "water water..."). Despite a 40 min delay (and one of last arrival at DUS) - Condor was not able to avoid apron-position - so further delays and missed our last shuttle bus (cost me 15 €). Obviously due to late arrival - also baggage needed additionally more than 30 min (there were no other passengers in arrival hall) - after arrival at conveyor belt. Also online check is only possible if you have pre-booked the seats (with add. costs) - only mentioning this after you finally filled-in the registration forms.

FRA-AYT-FRA: Check-in at 4 am was a mess and had to wait over an hour to get checked in as 6 or 7 flights were leaving early. However counters were well organized an electronic system was assigning counter numbers to the guests and representatives were walking around calling for passengers with flights that were about to close check in. Check in staff in AYT unfriendly didn't cared about seat requests and gave me an aisle stating flight is full although it was half empty and I was able to move on board to an empty row. Both flights were on 757-300 aircraft in good shape with retrofitted seats on inbound flight. Full meal on both flights and movies shown. Headsets need to be paid for. Crew friendly and announcements in both English and German. Would fly them again although sometimes it's a hit or miss experience and they're often affected by huge delays. If price and schedule are fine I would rather go with Air Berlin or TUIfly.

First time I fly with Condor (Comfort Cabin) and also last time. We had a 6.5 hour delay taking off to Frankfurt. I purchased Comfort Class (supposedly equivalent to Business Class) and to my surprise on my connecting flight to Munich they booked economy -if you pay Business you should get Business. The food is not impressive at all. The staff en route to Frankfurt not the best though the staff on return were very good.

### Condor Airlines customer review
We flew Condor from Frankfurt to Ft. Lauderdale. The flight was over 8 hours late taking off the crew did not perform the safety instructions and most of the Captains comments to the crew and passengers was in German. The crew did not translate his dialogue so most of the English speaking passengers were not aware of the issue with taking off - turned out this was a mechanical problem. We checked in at the airport 2 hours early for the flight and were told then that it would be delayed 8 hours. We were not given a reason or any kind of assistance. We also had to cancel our hotel reservations in Ft. Lauderdale because we were so late getting in (3am instead of 7pm). It was really a bad experience after a great 16 day cruise vacation.

DUS-LPA. Upgrade to Premium cabin very comfortable great meal and wonderful service. Flight departure and arrival ahead of schedule and luggage on carousel in a matter of ten minutes. Great value and great crew.

### Condor Airlines customer review
Condor is a low-cost airline so you get what you pay for - except it's not actually much cheaper than proper airlines so basically what you get is all the disadvantages and none of the advantages. Food is pretty poor in flight entertainment poor customer service non- existent. If things go wrong cancellations late departures and arrivals missed connections etc don't expect to get any thing back - they deny everything and blame 'unavoidable circumstances'. My advice avoid them.

Had booked direct flight FRA-Sharm el Sheikh. Got message 4 weeks before flight that the flight was changed to FRA-Hurghada-Sharm which took one hour longer. Delay because a whole bunch of Miss Germanys to be cameramen flying to Hurghada. Passengers were filmed without consent even their explicit partly angry refusal was filmed. After lunch an onboard Miss- election was performed. Reading or listening to an audio book was impossible. Flight back from Sharm to FRA direct this time but again a Condor cameraman on board who filmed passengers without asking their consent. Fare should have been rewarded to passengers as they took us as extra supporters for free. Food was poor. Sadly you don't have much choice of airlines if you want to fly from FRA to Sharm.

DUS-FUE-DUS. 757-300. Very Cheap tickets but zero comfort. If you're taller than 1.80 m don't expect any legroom. The rest was okay for the price (food service schedule).

We flew to Phuket and everything was all right. It was cheap and the staff kind. If you want more luxury you must pay more for the ticket.

### Condor Airlines customer review
I am very unsatisfied with Condor. For three times in a row Condor has changed the scedule of a flight I have booked. Last time they changed from a direct flight to a flight with a stop- over. From the beginning I could have bought a much cheaper flight if I would accept a flight with a stopover but I do not like a stopover. Condor sell a direct flight and afterwards they change it to a non direct flight without any disccount or possibility to cancel or change the ticket or getting the money back.

FRA-PMI-FRA. Tickets were rather expensive. Outbound we prebooked a so called Gourmet Meal which was not value for money. Service attentive and friendly. Seats okay but legroom very cramped. Inbound Gourmet Meal again not recommendable. Crew average. Seating in a door exit row very good. Overall nothing special expensive for a charter airline but at least on time.

FRA-MRU. Ticket prices are now expensive for what is basically a charter airline. Leg room in economy on outward leg was non-existent return leg was more comfortable after shelling out another 200 Euros to upgrade to Premium economy.

MUC-FRA-MAURITIUS: no good money for value at all! Economy class tickets were as much as 960€ although booked months in advance. Meals were of poor quality service non-existent. Charters just cannot do the long distance flights !
