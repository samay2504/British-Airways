### "a great experience"
Bangalore to Hyderabad. My first time with Air Costa – they been operating as a regional airline India for 2 years. A great experience, the legroom was really good, seats comfortable and the aircraft very new. It's low cost, so besides a glass of water, it costs. But given the flight time of little over an hour that's no problem. The range of food and beverages looked good though. The flight was 20 mins late – the only downside.
