### "very poor online check-in service"
I experienced a very poor online check-in service that was not user-friendly. Additionally, the customer service at the airport was lacking in experience, resulting in mishandled check-in luggage and a delay in its arrival at my destination by a few days. This airline is the worst I've ever traveled with, so I strongly advise against choosing it to avoid similar regret.

### “avoid this airline at any cost”
One of the world’s worst airlines, out 5 hours delay, inbound one hour delay plus luggage delay. Cabin not comfortable, only pork dish served, avoid this airline at any cost.

### “the seat is comfortable”
Not Verified |  The staff are friendly and the seat is comfortable. The air ticket is cheap. Although there's no TV and wifi, I can bring my pad and watch films. Not bad.

### "options we got were unacceptable"
Our transfer flight from Hong Kong got changed to a different day (18 hour delay with overnight layover) but no free accommodation was provided despite such an option mentioned on the official site. All support requests via email get ignored, as well as live chat on the official website. Had to call Hong Kong landline number and spent 30 minutes trying to get solution but with no luck. All the options we got were unacceptable - another flight to Bangkok instead (and not Phuket) - upgrade to business class on the later flight from Tokyo to HK (but still overnight layover in the airport with no hotel provided). Ffull refund round-way tickets, but impossible to refund only one-way. Trust cost more money than a 1-night hotel for 3 ppl. Leg-room space is slightly better than LCC (HK express/AirAsia) but much worse than any major airlines in the region (Thai/Cathay/JAL). Sats are worn-out and making big noises when you try to recline. Not comfortable, especially during overnight flight (not recommended anyway due to the low leg-room). No automatic check-in machines in the airport (Tokyo/HK/Thailand). Online check-in works, but need to spend a lot of time if you want to drop the baggage. Thailand if you do not get a paper ticket and use QR boarding pass,  you will have wait for special assistance and spend 10 mins+ for the manual checks. Due to this, flight from Phuket get delayed.

### "never fly Hong Kong Airlines again"
I tried to use the website to purchase extra baggage allowance, which would have cost about USD $30 for an extra 15kg, but the transaction did not go through. Instead I paid at the counter, and they charged me about USD $250. That was double the price of my ticket, basically tripling my cost. When I complained to the ground team, the attendant just told me  "be careful next time. If you punish your customers, its a losing strategy. I could have paid the same amount for Cathay Pacific with none of the bad business practices and attitude. I will never fly Hong Kong Airlines again.

### "Pathetic check in and ground service"
Pathetic check in and ground service at Hong Kong airport. Instead of reference, they ask for a ticket number. Ok provided. Check in not allowed. Transferring through Hong Kong from another airline. No problem- I’ll go to the transfer counter. They tell me transfer counter is only for Cathay Pacific. I need to go through immigration and check back in. Aisle K. So I run through the airport, through immigration and customs, back upstairs to check in, get terrible attitude from the check in staff. Staff on the plane are very nice, but come on guys. Get your stuff together. Or at least tell your passengers what to expect. Never again with Hong Kong Airlines

### "The crew were extremely nice"
Not Verified |  The crew were extremely nice, the flight was about 4 hours and 5 hours for the flight back to Hong Kong. The flight was really smooth. Props to the pilots. The food was light and average. The drinks were cool, the in flight entertainment was "out of service" but pretty sure the airline is on a budget. Warning that the ticket only includes 7 kg of luggage to take on the plane, and have to pay individually for luggage in cargo hold. 20 kg round trip more than 800 HKD. Seat was alright, had decent recline, trying to avoid flying with Hong Kong Airlines until maybe a few years later when they earn some money back. Overall above average flight.

### "courteous fight attendants"
Punctual departure from Hong Kong and arrival in Taipei. In flight service is rather minimal for an hour and half flight despite light meals are still distributed from the courteous fight attendants. Food are simple and they tasted okay. Seats are average in the class.

### "Quality airport and in-flight service"
This is definitely one of the underrated airlines. Quality airport and in-flight service for quite a reasonable price. Check in and boarding were smooth. The pilot has maintained adequate communication with us and the cabin crews were very attentive and helpful. The food was not superb but beyond average. The cabin crews kept checking us from time to time to see if we need anything else, which I asked one of the cabin crews for a refill for my cup and she was gladly to do so. Seats are average for its class. In-flight entertainment was great. A good selection of shows to choose from for less than a 3 hour flight. If you want to get the most bang for your buck, I think you can put Hong Kong Airline into the list.

### "Thank you to the flight attendants"
Thank you to the flight attendants of flight hx782 today, Monday the 27th. I left my phone in my seat on my flight and my phone made it to my next gate very quickly because the staff not only were wonderful but they care enough to not just put my phone in a box. I thank you from the bottom of my heart!

### "they're a just-meeting-expectations"
The really good thing about Hong Kong Airlines is that their prices are fairly reasonable and it remains that way even till a day or two before departure, which makes last minute flying with them great. Also, they do not charge a premium on one-way tickets (i.e. The cost of a one way ticket is roughly half the cost of a return ticket), so it really helps when flying multiple destinations. It was a disappointment that amenity kits weren’t provided in Business Class and the entire IFE system throughout the aircraft was malfunctioning on the flight. This certainly isn't my first time flying with them, and they're a just-meeting-expectations airline on the whole. Nevertheless, after taking into account their general punctuality record, I appreciate and would still recommend them for their flexibility especially for a last-minute traveler around Asia.

### "referring to strict booking conditions"
Bangkok to Hong Kong. We booked a flight with miles but had to pay # 60x2 EUR for taxes fees. We had to postpone our trip in November due to the events in HK and planned for February in order to stay within the limit of the validity of the ticket. But in February, nothing was possible and I asked for cancellation of both ticket, mentioning that I want to get my 13000 points x2 accredited to our accounts. Result: A credit of 54,04 EUR and very rude answer referring to strict booking conditions without any concern about Covid as if these people ignore the pandemic. Explanation about the credit can be get through the booking link, that not work. I sent a complain letter but after one week no answer.

### "disappointed and dissatisfied"
Tickets were a mess when leaving Vancouver yto Hong Kong. Ticket lady had to reprint them and fix our seats even though I had previously paid to select my seat. While getting that straightened out, saw a notice that the online entertainment was broken for the 14 he flight. Got on the plane and they didnt offer a paper, magazine or anything with no entertainment. Food was pretty good but when I selected fish and got chicken instead. Asked for alcohol drink they said they had wine and no coffee for food service but later they were giving coffee and beers. Also made everyone sit their chairs up to eat before serving. I found out that they did have alcohol but I had to go to the back for it because if I rang the assistance button they rarely delivered. I was very disappointed and dissatisfied. On a 14 he flight you need entertainment, they apologized for it but then tried to sell us treats from their menu to compliment the non movie movies.

### "very good solid service"
Hong Kong to Beijing. A very good solid service. The food is not ideal but satisfying. In flight entertainment was not working but was advised of this at check in. The boarding procedure was fast and the captain made adequate announcements keeping us informed at all times. The seat has a good recline pitch and is quite comfortable for the short trip.

### "regularly cancel their flights"
Vancouver to Beijing via Hong Kong. Hong Kong Airlines is the worst airline to book flights with because they regularly cancel their flights and do not care about what passengers have booked with them. I booked a flight in Sept of this year for travel in March and Hong Kong Airlines cancelled our flights to HK and Beijing right off costing me additional costs to make changes to our hotels. At the end, they offered me a full refund 3 months prior to departure when I had booked my flights 6 months prior, and their CS did not even bother to look up any other reasonable flight changes with other partner airlines to make my original arrival and departure dates work. I told them the reason I booked my flights in advance was to get the travel plans fully secured on exact dates and offering me a refund now would be useless as it would be impossible for me to find similar flights now. The CS did not seem to give a damn! Do not fly with them!

### "no way to clarify booking details"
We were 17 people traveling together and at Bangkok airport we were asked to pay extra for Myanmar (4 of them) passengers because their name was entered wrong. We have travelled HK Airlines before but this wasn’t a problem then. Myanmar citizens have only one continuous name with no surname or first name and we booked their tickets by entering their name twice in both fields. At the airport we were told that this is wrong and we needed to enter Mister or Miss in the first name field and the surname field to be entered with the whole name. Nowhere does it say this as we entered the name according to our previous experience. The ground staff said she was only working there and she could not do anything but follow orders. I do think if you take on a job you are expected to fulfill your responsibility towards the job and not fill a seat! Calling the Bangkok office is of no use because they do not pick up or keep you waiting and the automatically disconnects. So there is no way to clarify booking details. We went to the Bangkok office before the flight date and they didn’t say that there was an issue with the names then. This is high unacceptable. The flight itself was uncomfortable - the planes both to Hong Kong and to Osaka were small with no personal TV.

### "enough for short-haul"
Hong Kong to Taipei. During this 90-minute flight, using the IFE system is enough. The cabin was not much comfortable as the A330s was quite old. The catering service was quite short with a sausage bun but it's enough for short-haul. After touch down in Taipei, taxing was a bit long due to traffic control.

### "would recommend them"
Bangkok to Hong Kong. The really good thing about Hong Kong Airlines is that their prices are fairly reasonable and it remains that way even till a day or two before departure, which makes last minute flying with them great. Also, they do not charge a premium on one-way tickets (i.e. The cost of a one way ticket is roughly half the cost of a return ticket), so it really helps when flying multiple destinations. Other than that, it is quite an average airline with average legroom, below-average food, service, average IFE, etc. This certainly isn't my first time flying with them, and they're a just-meeting-expectations airline on the whole. I appreciate and would recommend them for their flexibility especially for a last-minute traveler around Asia.

### "they offered me a refund"
I booked a trip with Hong Kong Airlines in March 2019 for travel in December 2019. I booked it this far in advance so that I get decent prices on the flights. My flights were confirmed by Hong Kong Airlines and I booked the hotels at my destination. One month after I booked the trip, Hong Kong Airlines contacted me to let me know that the airline had cancelled our departure flight and that they were bumping us out by one day. Then 3 months prior to departure, Hong Kong Airlines contacted me again to let me know that the airline had now cancelled our return flight and they would be bumping us out by one day for our return flight. I contacted my travel agent to let them know that this was not acceptable as it would cost me more money again to book a hotel for the extra day. After spending hours and days on this, nobody at my travel agency or Hong Kong Airlines was able to assist me. At the end, they offered me a refund. I let them know that the reason I had booked my flights 9 months in advance is because I wanted to ensure that I get decent prices on my flights. Giving me a refund 3 months prior to departure is not going to help me find similar flights on the dates that I needed them on.

### "Getting seats assigned impossible"
Not Verified |  Los Angeles to Bangkok via Hong Kong. I purchased a ticked from an online travel agency, and none of the seat selections was respected, even though the receipt showed them as confirmed. For online check-in instead of using the name and locator number, they require the ticket number, which was not on the agency confirmation. The lounge in LAX was mediocre. On the LAX to Hong Kong leg, the hard product (cabin/seat) at first glance looked quite comfortable enough. The soft product was of vastly inferior quality. The seat was dirty, crumbs on the seat, and stains on the armrest. The service was uncoordinated and slow. The bread came after the main course. The drinks were poured once, and any further request for either a refill or more water was only brought after a long wait or a reminder. The wifi was unusable. One could see the network, but there was never a connection. Getting seats assigned on the return portion was impossible at airport checkin on the outbound, and could only be done 24 hours prior to the last segment departure (not 24 hours before the first segment departure, as is standard). A call to their customer service line resulted in "I cannot open the seat map. There is a lot of competition on these routes, and, I'm sorry to say, for the price, this is the worst option.

### "the Cabin Crew were exceptional"
My son and I were flying from Vancouver to Hong Kong with Hong Kong Airlines. Everything was going extremely well, until my son's stomach started to hurt and started throwing up. The Cabin Crew were extremely nice and they allowed my son to lie down in business class. One of the Cabin Crew was really nice to my son. They asked if he wanted hot water every hour and also gave him some medicine to reduce pain in his stomach. Overall, I think the Cabin Crew were exceptional and they also arranged him a wheelchair.

### "that was the ticket I bought"
My flight was Sapporo to Bangkok but I had to transfer on Hong Kong about 24 hrs. For first 24hrs I accept to wait because that was the ticket I bought but the airplane was delayed after that. I asked them as I want to get a shower but they say no and give me a voucher for food. The flight still delayed so they gave me a second voucher food which mean nothing to me. I’m  disappointed didn’t fix the problem properly to me.

### "they changed my seat"
Okinawa to Hong Kong. Very bad service, I reserved aisle seat, but they changed my seat without notifying me. After just boarding the flight, they have not turned on the AC and the cabin is really hot.

### "Cabin crew and service is good"
Beijing to Hong Kong. Ticket quite cheap (comparing to an average of HK$2500, this was only HK$1000). New aircraft. Check in at PEK is fast, but boarding is a little messy. Cabin crew and service is good (they may also accept flight logs). Meal was nasty as usual since air cater was done in PEK.

### "Efficient cabin crew"
Bangkok to Los Angeles via Hong Kong. Efficient cabin crew serviced passengers quickly and met all basic expectations. They might not seem friendly, but they were not rude. I assumed their focus were on speed and getting the job done. Good in-flight entertainment - lots of selections catering to local and international passengers. Plenty of snacks and drinks during flight, self-service style. Hot food were ok.

### "enthusiastic, charming and very efficient"
HX offers very attractive price for business class for destinations such as Okinawa, Bangkok and Denpasar etc. An older ex SIA aircraft was used, the seat was 2x2x2 angle lie flat. For medium to short haul, that's perfectly fine. What impressed me the most are the wonderful set of crew on board, they are enthusiastic, charming and very efficient. For a flight of nearly just 2 hours, they managed to do a full service (welcome drink, hot towel, meal in 2 separate courses). Compared to my recent experience with Thai, who just stacked everything onto one try for a sector slightly longer than from HKG to Okinawa. HX has a good and extensive duty free catalogue. Boarding was very orderly, and parked at aero bridge. Despite the bad rep and recent financial troubles and rumours for shutting down, things seems pretty ok. They have every reason to stay on the market, and I wish them well, I will continue to chose them for Bangkok, Okinawa and Denpasar.

### "no record of the service"
I was returning with my 92 years old dad from Shanghai to Hong Kong, because my dad has difficulty walking long distance, so I called two days ahead for wheelchair service. Upon check in the agent has no record of the service, but said will arrange a wheelchair in 30 mins. When it’s time I went back to the agent and had to wait for another 25 mins before a wheelchair was brought out. After being pushed to the gate, we were told another agent will be back and push my dad onto the plane. Upon boarding we waited but no one showed up. There was another lady on wheelchair and agent told her she needed to be the last one to board the plane. After most people boarded still no one came by, so I asked an agent and she immediately asked a female agent to push my dad in. After arrival to Hong Kong, We were told a wheelchair will be brought to door after everyone departs. Then 10 mins after everyone departed the plane, they told us a wheelchair is here and who wanted to go first (two passengers needed wheelchair). Since my dad was standing he was pushed thru the ramp to terminal right outside the gate. Then they asked my dad to sit on a bench while they went back to push the other lady out. Afterwards they said will check for another wheelchair for my dad while they pushed the lady out to customs. We waited for 40 mins without sign of any wheelchair. An agent was accompanying us and he kept checking. Finally my dad was upset and decided to slowly walked out himself while holding my arm. The agent said wheelchair was handled by another company and they were lack of resources! The flight service was decent but be warned if you have a need for wheelchair service!

### "rescheduled last minute"
Hong Kong to Vancouver. My flight connection was rescheduled last minute from a 2 hour layover into a 12 hour layover and they would not let me use the lounge while I waited. Now I’m stuck without a place to relax. I feel it would be easy for them to accommodate me for their own scheduling mistake, but they do not. Furthermore it seems the lounge staff and help desk do not even have the authority to accommodate me if they wanted to. Won’t fly with them again.

### "Would definitely do again"
Los Angeles to Bangkok via Hong Kong. Flew on same exact brand new A-350 (B-LGH) on three of the four legs and on an older A330. The A350 was in the new herring bone configuration, which is more modern but not necessarily more comfortable than the older business cabin on the 330. Check-In ans Boarding efficient and quick, lounges in LAX (International Lounge) and BKK (Miracle Lounge) were mediocre, in HKG (Auris) - Great. Amenities were standard, food was good and it was presented well. Wine selection was limited, and drinks/refills were not offered as much as it should be customary in Business class. Cabin crew was hard working and courteous, maybe a bit inexperienced. My seat (12K) got stuck on both long legs and I had to be reseated. WiFi was only available on the last leg. Overall an excellent experience and great value for the price paid. Would definitely do again.

### "carrier does an okay job"
Other than a low price, I do not find many redeeming qualities. The aircraft were new, but the layout appeared a bit uncoordinated as did the design and color schemes. Service was very green and awkward. I found the food was very mediocre, rather institutional. IFE was lacking in selection. The seats were good and the flight was on time. This carrier does an okay job if it serves your low fare needs.

### "rude people at check in"
Auckland to Hong Kong. Worst experience with an airline.Very unhelpful and rude people at check in. The women at the check in desk asked us to show her on our ticket what the flight number was, She couldn't read her own airline ticket. On top of that she also missed that the luggage were traveling all the way to Istanbul and messed that up. We'll never fly with Hong Kong Airlines again.

### "waited 24 hrs for our baggage"
Our flight from Los Angeles to Hong Kong was delayed for 5 hrs, then Hong Kong to Manila was also delayed. The worst part is when we arrived to Manila, 3 of our baggage didn't arrive, we waited another 24 hrs for our baggage. Never gonna fly this airline again.

### "a very impressive experience"
Hong Kong Airlines seems to be going strong, despite of the recent rumours about their financial hardship. For this route HX deployed an Ex SIA A330 plane, with old style angle lie flat seat at 2-2-2 configuration. It's from the 90s but still at acceptable condition. Leg room and seat pitch are acceptable, only it's a bit cramped when in fully flat position. This is ok for short haul flights like this one, so no complaints. Catering and wine selection is average. Beef is a typically difficult type of meat to serve and get right on board. My beef dish was tough, so I ate only half. Despite these short comings, what makes HX shine are their well trained cabin crew, who are courteous and hard working. They are also very pro-active and see to my every need throughout the flight, reminds me of how things used to be in the long gone past. They have a very good on board duty free catalog that offers some unique items. Fast track was given to help speed through immigration process. Priority bags are amongst the first to be delivered. Overall, a very impressive experience.

### "a flight to forget"
Osaka to Hong Kong. This flight was well below par in terms of service, no smile from flight attendants, no slippers offered. Inflight meal arrived without chopsticks for starter, no refill of drink and my food tray was not collected for over an hour. Whilst waiting for the bathroom, near the middle of the aircraft I saw the Cabin Crew looking after the economy class were preparing drinks on trays to offer economy class passengers. Seems like Economy Class passengers had better service than business class passengers on this flight. Was a flight to forget. Economy class luggage was delivered before Priority Baggage. The positive is it seems as if inflight meals have improved significantly the past two flights.

### "Flight was punctual"
Manila to Vancouver via Hong Kong, the first leg from Manila was Philippine Airlines. Our layover was only 2 hrs but we had to line up for an hour in HKG to get our connecting boarding passes. Prior to the flight I had checked in online already and saved the bar codes in my phone, however according to the staff, these were not allowed and printed copies were required. They should have at least noted that online. During boarding they did not prioritize families with children. Inflight entertainment is limited to movies and music. Inflight food is not nourishing for me. The cabin crew are very accommodating and helpful. Flight was punctual as expected.

### "flight is about 80% full"
Beijing to Hong Kong. The flight is about 80% full. My seat is in the middle next to wings. I was served a meal without any choice. As I really didn't want to eat spicy noodles the cabin attendant gave me breads instead, but  no butter. Since no entertainment on this old airplane, a passenger use speaker loudly of his mobile phone to watch something in flight.

### "quite low price we paid"
Bangkok to Los Angeles via Hong Kong. First of all, the Hong Kong Airlines website is really clunky and bad. The error messages are cryptic and useless at best. We were not able to check in online, and got different error messages each time. We purchased VIP lounge passes, but only received 1 via email/text and was unable to attach them to our itinerary or my frequent flier account. I was unable to make an FF account for my wife, again useless error messages. Check in lines were pretty long, and boarding was poorly managed. We paid extra for the "extra legroom" seats for the HKG to LAX and return and if those have 3" extra legroom, I'd hate to sit in a normal seat. The seats were also hard and uncomfortable. I have flown a number of other Asian carriers (Singapore, EVA, Korean primarily) and all had much more comfortable normal seats. The food was poor and very little choice. No self-serve snacks, no menu provided. Only Chinese-style food and it just wasn't that good. There was limited water/juice service throughout the flight. Considering the quite low price we paid, it was reasonable. But if you look at other seasons, the prices are not even competitive with airlines with better service, I think our fare was somewhat of a fluke.

### "impressed and appreciative"
Not Verified |  On Nov 24 2018 we arrived at the Ho Chi Minh Airport only to find our flight would be delayed due to a typhoon. I want to thank the staff at Hong Kong Airlines for taking such good care of us from Ho Chi Minh to Hong Kong to Vancouver, and even arranging our flight through Air Canada from Vancouver to Calgary. I panicked several times due to not being well travelled. I want to express my deepest appreciation for the absolute care & attention provided to me and my family every step of the way, ensuring alternate flights were arranged, looking after our luggage, and reassuring us that they care. I am so very impressed and appreciative. Thank you!

### "unacceptable service"
Hong Kong to Ho Chi Minh City. Our flight was delay 6 hours from SFO to Hong Kong. Our flight from Hong Kong to Ho Cho Minh delayed. Once we landed in Hong Kong they gave me the first flight out but it’s 23 hours wait. They gave another family of 3 guests on the same flight out as ours from Hong Kong to Ho Chi Minh on Vietnam Airline. This is the worst experience of flying. This is unacceptable service.

### "rebooking cost will be 800HKD"
My husband and I attempted to speak with many different staff and no one assisted us. My husband and I were booked on two separate flights from Hong Kong to Okinawa. I was on the 0710 flight, he was on the 1130. The 0730 flight was not full, so we asked if we could change my husband’s flight to 0730, so that we could back to Okinawa together. Many people we asked just said simply I can’t do that, no information provided why or where to switch the flight. One lady said I can switch the flight, but the rebooking cost will be 800HKD. There were 3 empty seats next to me. What a waste!

### "comfortable as a medium range flight"
I used Hong Kong Airlines from Tokyo to Bangkok via Hong Kong. Check-in was smooth and on time flight. I was saved because I got a fast track pass at Bangkok. In Hong Kong lounge was wonderful, comfortable space and delicious food and drinks. On the other hand, the Narita lounge was comfortable but the cuisine was one more, the Bangkok lounge was narrow and not very comfortable. The equipment is slightly old impression, but it was enough comfortable as a medium range flight. It was disappointing that there was no champagne in the welcome drink. In-flight meal was average content, but I enjoyed having a lot of wine. As local people were eating with time shifting, it seems that such services are also available. I think that it is more better if there is Japanese menu book.

### Hong Kong Airlines customer review
Hong Kong to Bangkok. I haven't flown with Hong Kong Airlines for well over a year and so much has changed (for the better). Both sectors the business class is 1x2x1 configuration fully flat bed. The new lounge at the satellite terminal is beautiful and really worth a visit.The service is top notch, with an improved menu. Welcome drink is just water and juice, no champagne on offer, but alcohol is served during the meal if requested. Boarding is very orderly and efficient both in HK and BKK. Crew are welcoming and pro-active, especially the senior purser who held a great conversation with me. On return, a new A350 aircraft is deployed and the product just got even better! The famous Blue elephant restaurant designed a good menu for them. I am truly impressed by such an airline from my own country, their business class tickets are often very reasonably priced. therefore I have no hesitation to fly with them again in future.

### "there was no entertainment"
Hong Kong to Seoul in March. The cabin crew was lack of teamwork. Food was fine but the beverage they offered was limited with very few choices. No personal TV was offered within the plane, so there was no entertainment.

### "delayed again for 2 hours"
Hong Kong to Hanoi. First delayed for 45 minutes then delayed again for 2 hours ( technical issues). They provided 75 HKD restaurant voucher. After getting on the plane, the departure was delayed for 50mins. They shouldn't have made customers wait in the flight.

### "surprisingly nice and attentive"
❌ Not Verified |  Auckland to Hong Kong. Flight was quite expensive but I had to book it last minute and no other options were available, as this was the Christmas-New Year period. I arrived well in-time for check-in at Auckland Airport; scheduled departure was 10:15 am, and I arrived just before 8 am. Online check-in was not available for this flight (no reason given). Only two counters opened for check-in at the airport for Hong Kong Airlines. There was already a long queue for what it looked like was a very full flight, and the line was getting longer behind me as well. Check-in process took awfully long; The three ground staff were slow, rude and unapologetic. I was still waiting for my turn at the scheduled boarding time of 9:30 am. They had to rush the last 20 or so passengers for check-in and rudely told us to run to the gate or we'll miss the flight. No priority was given at security, and no airport carts were used to transport us to the gate. I double-checked both at check-in and at boarding-gate with staff to ensure both my check-in bags were on the flight, considering the check-in was hectic; I was assured both times that my bags were on the plane. We finally made it onto the aircraft and departed almost 30 minutes late. Plane and seats were old but nevertheless comfortable - I had a window seat at the back of the plane; curtains and interior were a warm red colour. Cabin-crew were surprisingly nice and attentive; leg room was sufficient and I managed to get an empty seat next to me. Food was delicious, toilets clean, and the help-yourself-minibar at the back of the plane made the difference. IFE was mediocre; not a lot of choice but sufficient. Arrived in Hong Kong 20 minutes ahead of schedule. I went to the transfer desk in Hong Kong Airport to make my Jet Airways connecting flight, here they advised me and some of my fellow passengers that due to late check-in at Auckland, out bags weren't loaded onto the aircraft and they will be coming on the next flight. After I arrived at Mumbai, it took 5 days for them to deliver the bag to my Mumbai address after countless calls and E-mails. Overall, not a bad flight, but they need a more efficient check-in process to ensure all passengers that arrived on time are checked-in on time by the ground staff and ready to board at least before the schedule boarding time.

### "quality of food is not bad"
I booked this Hong Kong Airlines flight to Vancouver from Hong Kong because of its unbelievable low price (USD380 return, tax included) it was due to the launch of this long haul service. This is the first long-haul route for HX. I took HX flight many times already but never on a long haul one. Honestly, I did worry a lot before the fight. Once I board the plane, I realised there was no TV on the seat. I was totally freak out as I thought I had to spend 14 hours on the plane without any entertainment. There was also no chargers as well. But after the plane took off, flight attendants hand out iPad with pre-loaded movies and videos to passengers. They are not wonderful but better than nothing. The seats are quite standard economy seats like other airlines. Surprisingly the quality of their food is not bad at all. One thing which makes the airline look very cheap is, they blocked out the whole front row and asked people to pay extra to sit. Even there was no one paid the seats, they left them all empty and put a plate on those seats saying you have to pay to sit there.

### "I didn't have Canadian visa"
I booked a flight from Hong Kong to Seattle through Hong Kong Airlines website. However, when I visited the counter to check-in, I was rejected and missed the flight because I didn't have Canadian visa as there was an internal transit at Vancouver. After asking what Hong Kong Airlines can do to fix my problem, they told me to call to contact center by myself, and it took me 7 hours (9am to 4pm) to get an answer that they could do nothing, not even a refund, and it was my mistake not checking with Canadian immigration rules before booking the flight. As a result, i needed to book from the another airline which is very expensive and I get nothing, not even sympathy.

### "Meal service only had pork"
Hong Kong to Nanjing. Meal service only had pork as opposed to my request for something else. Cabin crew who was serving meal wasn't co-operating. Later another cabin crew and their manager came into help and provided me with some meal and offered to double check my return flight's meal request. Check service at HKG airport was good.

### "brought my wife and I one blanket"
I caught a red-eye flight from Bali to Taipei via Hong Kong. I had to ask four flight attendants over a period of 10 to 15 minutes before I received a blanket. One flight attendant brought my wife and I one blanket, but we clearly asked for two (we held up two fingers when we requested the blankets). She later gave two blankets to a couple several rows in front of us. I had to ask another flight attendant (the fourth) to get a blanket. Most people use a blanket on red-eye flights, so I can't see why they were not stowed in the seat pockets, as I have experienced with other airlines.

### "I'd fly them again"
Bangkok to Hong Kong. Pricing is the reason for round trips. I arrived at the airport kiosk, no queue. The hostess welcome was okay. Boarding time is 08.25 am. They were on time. but waiting so long to take off. Onboard, the seat was clean. but I want to change to long legroom. The hostess said I need to pay an extra charge, so I don't change. Seat big enough. They have a TV. The quality of the food was not too bad. I'd fly them again.

### "as compensation they upgraded us"
Hong Kong to Okinawa. We arrived at the airport to check in. Tried checking in online and at the airport kiosk and didn't work, we saw the line was rather long so asked their staff whether we should do anything and both told us to stay in line until they call our destination for last minute boarding. We wait until they finally call Okinawa, followed the staff to the express counter, at which point they told us "your flight is closed cos you're late". What's worse is that they tried to pass it off as our fault at the beginning despite us following their instructions. When they did finally rebook us on tomorrow's flight they said "we normally charge customers to rebook but we'll waive it for you" as if they were being generous. In the end they rebooked us on tomorrow's early flight and as compensation they upgraded us. Also gave us two food vouchers for the airport, as if airport food is great. I told them I wanted to be compensated for the taxi rides to the airport, lost hotel night, and lost day of car rental but they can't do anything about it.

### "efficient, friendly, and professional"
Bangkok to Vancouver via Hong Kong. Pricing is the reason I flew them, so expectations were low. The cabin crew was very efficient, friendly, and professional. There were often three meal choices in economy. They were on time for the two segments I flew. The recline on the seats was spectacular. Sorry, people behind you. The A330 aircraft are older, with threadbare seats, no wifi, and an interior decked out in Reds and Golds. Their frequent flyer program is sub par. 208 cheap one way economy tickets from Bangkok to Hong Kong will get you a free one way economy over the Pacific. Not really worth participating in, unless you tend to pay higher fares. And the lack of entertainment in the seatbacks. They handed out iPads, but they really didn't stack up to a real entertainment system. The quality of the food was pretty poor, I left most of the suspected meat items on the tray. I'd fly them again, if the price was really right.

### "First class service!"
Vancouver to Taipei via Hong Kong, Vancouver is a relatively new route by Hong Kong Airlines. All their airplanes are very new, the Hong Kong to Taipei leg was flown by a brand new A350-900! If that wasn't pleasant enough, their Hong Kong ground staff are even better. I missed my alarm clock that morning and arrived at Hong Kong International Airport only 35 minutes before the departure time, Hong Kong Airlines sent one of their staff to accompany me to a quick check booth going through the immigration and safely check, then all the way to the boarding gate. First class service!

### "Will consider other options next time"
Flew Hong Kong Airlines from Seoul Incheon to Hong Kong. Website was overly-complex. At first it seemed only frequent flyers could access any of the services every other passenger would expect elsewhere. No self-check in service. I had to re-enter my data several times before it was accepted. Booking confirmation reference was 13 digits long and thus hard to remember since most only use 6 numbers. Gate was the furthest ends of the terminal for both origin and destination and there was no view. Seat was far too narrow and very hard and there was awful garish red upholstry. Legroom was quite good but my right leg was obstructed by the seat support in front. No footrest. There was a loose velcro strap hanging down from the seat in front to which could not seem to cling back. No USB port. Very limited IFE with really tiny manual buttons. Screen was dim even at brightest setting. Aircon was not adjustable. They gave cheap ear plugs instead of headphones. Sound quality was poor and required frequent adjustment. Cabin Crew moved so quickly in the aisle that I could not even get a beverage from them. Loyalty points cannot be claimed retrospectively. Lots of long announcements with an annoying bell chime that left your ears ringing about duty free but nothing about the hour long delay until landing. Will consider other options next time.

### "hardware was absolutely perfect"
Flew from Los Angeles to Bangkok and back. I was happy with the flight LA to HK and back as it was a brand new aircraft. HK to BKK was an older airbus but I preferred the older one as it had more leg room and wider seats. It looked like a higher grade plane, even rest room were more equipped. Pros: Good schedule, on time, we were anxious about a connecting flight from Bangkok onwards to India but made it in time. Crew were smart and nice uniform provided good service. No issues at all. There were snacks and juices at back to aircraft near galley that one could pick up anytime. Food was very good and served hot. Cons: Not many concerns, just the longer flight from LA to HKK was hard on the butt after few hours as it had less cushion, I guess to cut cost and weight that is my only negative esp. on a longer 15-16 hour flight the seat can get uncomfortable. A big one for me personally was the frustrating online check-in process that kept giving vague error messages that made no sense, just some weird code. That was the most frustrating part, the website, the human element and hardware was absolutely perfect. Airport Check in was smooth, friendly and efficient.

### "very slow in-flight service"
Flew Hong Kong Airlines from Auckland to Narita via Hong Kong. Firstly, very slow in-flight service by the crew. Took 30 min just to get a cup of coffee, and I needed to ask twice for that. Secondly, my suitcase was not properly transported to my destination, and when finally I received it a couple of days later, they had locked it and so I ended up having to break it open. None of this would have happened if I hadn't chosen to fly this appalling airline.

### "you get what you paid for"
Early booked on this flight and got a relatively cheap deal, but you get what you paid for. The plane felt old and probably was from its parent Hainan Airlines. The flight itself was smooth, and the service was OK. The downsides are that the toilets never seemed to be clean and the meal portion was quite small for a 11+ hour flight. Also the ground handling managed to cause a damage to one of my luggage. Still waiting for airline feedback on compensation but it's not looking positive. The customer service phone number in Taiwan doesn't work.

### "pretty poor service"
Gold Coast to Shanghai via Hong Kong. My bag did not arrive with my business class flight with Hong Kong Airlines from Gold Coast to Shanghai via Hong Kong. I left instructions with HK Airlines for it to be forwarded to me at my hotel in Shenzen as I was departing shortly afterwards for that city. It took innumerable calls to track my luggage - I was finally informed more than 24 hours later that it had arrived at Shenzhen airport and I had to go and pick it up myself. This was after 9 pm at night. They refused to deliver to my hotel like any other airline would do. I had no alternative but to go the airport myself the following morning. The airport was an hour from the city, and i had appointments that i had to cancel to go there. Once there I had to wait 2 hours as the bag was not where they had said. It was an extremely difficult situation for me as very few people at the airport spoke english. After many phone calls to Hong Kong and Shanghai, the bag was finally located at a totally different place from where I had been told. Altogether it took almost 4 hours to get my bag back at my hotel. The bag also had a cut in the side. The only compensation HK Airlines offered for all this stress and inconvenience was the cost of the taxi to and from the airport! All in all, pretty poor service for an international airline!

### "staff was so nice and friendly"
Hong Kong to Seoul Incheon. The staff was so nice and friendly I had to write this review. They brought me every little extra stuff like more orange juice and bread and butter and stayed super friendly. They literally wanted to help me which was a nice feeling. Everything else was good too, food as well.

### "delayed by more than 3 hours"
My first time travelling with Hong Kong Airlines from Hong Kong to Seoul and my flight was delayed by more than 3 hours due to operational reasons. Their website still showed the scheduled flight time, which was very misleading. I called up the customer service but they could not confirm the gate number. Finally, I had to check over the counter to confirm it.

### "flight was delayed overnight"
Vancouver to Taipei via Hong Kong. I knew that because of a typhoon my flight in Hong Kong would be delayed. However the airline wouldn't let me change the time of the starting flight from Vancouver to avoid the bad weather. They promised a hotel in Hong Kong if the connecting flight was delayed overnight, but then once I got to Hong Kong it wouldn't give a hotel. To make matters worse it attempted the connecting flight to Taipei, only to turn back halfway due to strong winds. After that fiasco they gave us 500HKD (USD65), which is not enough for a solo passenger to get a hotel anywhere near Hong Kong airport. There was a typhoon. What did the airline expect?

### "an awful, irresponsible, and inconsiderate airline"
My connecting flight from Hong Kong to Bangkok was suddenly cancelled, and changed to a flight 10+ hours later, only 2 days before. I was on my trip without the internet and just got informed about it when I checked in at Beijing. The ground staff in Beijing could not help with anything. I asked for an earlier flight, any hotel, any lounge service. They said I have to contact Hong Kong Airlines myself. Why would you have a ground service that cannot support a passenger that needs help? I flew to Hong Kong, just to find out that all rooms at airport hotels were fully booked. I went back to Hong Kong Airlines ground counter. They could not help with any accommodation, and only provided earlier flight to Bangkok after a lot of begging (now, +6 hours from the original one). My wife and I were stranded in the airport without support from the airline for 6-7 hours. When we came back to drop our luggage for the new flight, still no assistance and we had to wait in the long queue for over 30 minutes. If we knew that we can get an earlier flight, we wouldn't have taken out our luggage and just used transfer lounge to wait. Or even book a hotel in advance. The airline just did as it pleased, and didn't care about passenger experience at all. Such an awful, irresponsible, and inconsiderate airline. I don't recommend to anyone. This was my first and my last flight with Hong Kong Airlines.

### "ground staff were pitiful"
Hong Kong Airlines ground staff were pitiful. The woman that printed our boarding pass for the Hong Kong to Beijing flight was absolutely rude and talked to us like we were stupid. We were only asking questions about our baggage to make sure we don't lose them. She was not nice, probably because it was 5:10 am. She was not able to provide a nice service, information and good words to customers.

### "flight attendants super friendly"
Hong Kong to Taipei. Just flew them yesterday. Got to the airport 4 hours before departure, was told at checkin the flight had been overbooked, had the option to take another flight in a hour with another airline in economy or take the next flight with Hong Kong Airlines at 10:35pm which was 5 hours after my original departure. So we decided to wait and take their later flight. When we checked in to the lounge we was told the flight is at midnight now. However the staff ware very friendly, the seats was alright. The food was delicious and flight attendants was super friendly. They are great for value compared to CX business on the same route.

### "inflight entertainment pretty good"
Tokyo Narita to Hong Kong with Hong Kong Airlines. The check-in counter did not open until 2 hours before the departure time, which is an annoying policy. So it is utterly useless if you want to arrive at the airport earlier and save time for shopping or going to lounge to rest after going through the customs. This is particularly hateful as an hour or so was typically not enough for Hong Kong travellers to buy souvenirs in Japanese airports as there are loads of stuff to buy. The flight was delayed for around 40 minutes, which was nice, at this occasion interestingly. The A333 is equipped with inflight entertainment, of which I can watch movies and listen music, pretty good. The legroom is within reasonable range, not spacious but acceptable. The hot meal is included in the ticket price. It was reasonably good. The crew refused to store my fruit in the fridge politely. No complain on this, just a bonus if this request was accepted.

### "very impressed with the airline"
❎ Unverified |  Mumbai to Auckland via Hong Kong. When I travelled to hong kong via Jet Airways and then to Auckland thereafter with Hong Kong Airlines, I was very impressed with the airline. To begin with the greetings on board in English, the airline staff made me feel so comfortable, the seats were brilliant and much better then Jet Airways. The service is 10 grade, the staff took care of me and my my family so well be it food, drinks or even my 7 month old toddler. I am impressed with the airline for its service, food served me my choice of Indian (hindu meal) the best rajma chawal I have had, the drinks and the uninterrupted service on a 11 hour journey. I would recommend all my family members and friends to try Hong Kong Airlines. Just add a lot of movies and entertainment as its a 11 hour journey.

### "it got me to where I want"
Beijing to Hong Kong return with Hong Kong Airlines. The first flight was an older model without IFE. The second flight was on a much newer and more comfortable plane, with IFE. Usual meals and bathroom facilities. Happy with ground crew, she was able to send my luggage all the way to my final destination on a different airline and ticket. Budget airline and fare. It got me to where I want over the Chinese New Year festival.

### "good service and tasty food"
This is the first time travelling with Hong Kong Airlines flying from Bangkok to Hong Kong. It's also my first experience in Hong Kong Airline J Class. My pork noodles were cooked by the famous Thai cuisine restaurant, Blue Elephant which were delicious. The cabin equipment is clean and tidy. Cabin crews are nice and very friendly! Entertainment services (movie, TV) are very up to date. Good service and tasty food. Affordable price, taking into account that I flew business class.

### "drink and hot snack are served free"
Hong Kong to Chengdu. Hong Kong Airlines is the low cost Hong Kong airline, owned by Hainam Airlines. It costs 1/3 flying them compared to Cathay Pacific, so I shall have no complaints. The seat pitch is tighter than Cathay or other airlines. It was a dinner time flight and drink and hot snack are served free. No complaints as expectation was not high, to be fair.

### "fraught with red tape"
Ground Staff at Osaka Airport require more training. My partner and I arrived in Hong Kong on 29 October. We are both British passport holders although I also have a Hong Kong ID card. My partner has leave to stay in Hong Kong for 6 months and this is clearly stated on a slip attached to his passport. We took a trip to Kyoto (via Osaka) for 6 days. Everything was fine on the outward journey but the return trip yesterday was fraught with red tape. First, despite having checked in online 48 hours before, we had to get our boarding passes at the check-in desk at Osaka Airport. It was really frustrating as we only had hand luggage! We saw 5 members of the staff attending to one lady customer while the queue grew ever longer. Little did we know that we would have the same attention. The girl at the counter asked my partner how long he was/would be staying in Hong Kong, wanted to see his return ticket to England etc. We pointed out the page where it stated that he could stay until April 2017 of he wanted, but she sought advice from a colleague and then 4 more joined her!! We couldn't to get them to understand that he can stay in HK for 6 months. Eventually they asked my partner to sign a "Release of Indemnity". The process of queuing and grilling lasted from 14.25 to 15.50. They were all very polite and very apologetical - in fact 2 gentlemen later saw us at the gate and apologised again for their lack of English, but it was no less frustrating and annoying for us. My partner could not have been the only British passport holder in this situation. I think that with more training the check-in staff could have more confidence to deal with similar situations. Other than that, we were happy flying with Hong Kong Airlines on such short haul flights

### "nothing to complain about"
I have been flying with Hong Kong Airlines many times on this same route from Naha to Hong Kong, it has never disappointed me. Excellent flight time, punctuality, matched with equally satisfactory inflight service and catering. Very often they sell seats at promotional price, make this an instant winner over the other airline from HK which serves this route (But at a hugely marked up price). For a 2 hour flight, from the airport priority check-in, lounge access, to the wonderful 1-2-1 seat arrangement (flat bed), there is nothing to complain about. Crew were enthusiastic and pro-active. The menu has 3 choices, and a small but acceptable wine list. I feel for the price I paid, this is more than I had expected. If anything to pick it would be the food, it's not bad, but it is not yet very good, one little area to improve on. Priority luggage first the belt, I couldn't ask for more.

### "ground staff were awful"
My travel was PVG to BKK with a stop in HKG. Travel was on October 22nd 2016. The check in (about 2 pm) took 1 hour because they were changing my flight from PVG to HKG. The check in agent said don't worry the flight will not leave before 7 pm because of weather. The gate personnel and the flight notification board said go to gate, flight leaving at 3 pm. At gate, the personnel there had no idea what was happening and just said stay at the gate. They were not even airline personnel. I went to the lounge and called the airline. They said the plan was now a 7 pm departure, and the plane was still in HKG. The plane finally boarded at 8 pm. We then spent 4.5 hours parked at the ramp while the pilots waited for a takeoff slot. Finally arriving at 3 am in HKG (3 hours after my connection left). In HKG, the staff were very rude about rebooking and told me that I could wait until they were ready. Apparently they started work at 4 am, so we needed to wait. I was finally booked on a flight leaving to BKK at 1 pm. That flight was delayed until 2 pm. Then we were boarded and made to wait on the plane another 2 hours before takeoff. Arrived BKK about 6 pm. In short, the air staff were very good and the flights were fine. The ground staff were awful and seemed to have very little training or information. I travel a lot and decided to save a little money on this trip, but the ground service was the worst I have ever had. On a good note, The lounge in HKG was not bad at all.

### "staff were rude"
Flew Hong Kong Airlines from Hanoi to Hong Kong. Flight attendant rolled her eyes at me when I asked for a glass of red wine. It was a major mission to agree to this request. Staff were rude, dismissive and completely uninterested in providing any type of service. Not recommending this airline to anyone.

### "staff totally disinterested"
Hanoi to Hong Kong with Kong Kong Airlines. Terrible staff attitude - rolls eyebrows when my friend asked for service. Staff totally disinterested. Gave another passenger a talking down for moving one seat over when did not matter. Unprofessional. As well, bags delayed excessive amount of time on arrival - staff did not care.

### "calling card to win my business"
Hong Kong to Beijing. 0740 departure on this return leg trip. On the inward trip for the long haul, wanted to change seats on their partner Hainan Airlines, as the inward seats 15 D/G were close to the lavatories etc. On checking in at HKG the agent issued our boarding tickets and lounge pass. I neglected to ask her prior to issue to elect another seat assignment. She said there was availability to change. She would work on it and I should advise their lounge staff to finalize the change. Yeah, like that would happen. In being accustomed to CX's lounge offerings, I was hoping for the noodle bar, unfortunately not at HK Airlines. I did ask the lounge staff to assist, as advised. They said they would help. Their lounge was nice and had plenty to select. The lounge staff advised we could collect our new passes at the departure gate. Arrived at the departure gate and they had no information, but would check. The flight was now on airport hold. Gave the original passes back and said they would contact Beijing staff to assist. Flight was on time, again nice presentation and service. Breakfast, albeit a western choosing was excellent. Fresh, served piping hot and refills on coffee and juice. Arrived on time. On deplaning, much to my surprise a HK Airlines agent was at the end of the jet way with name cards for us. She not only had our new boarding passes, but lounge invitation cards to boot. She also pointed out the security and screening location. We were through the process in 20 minutes. Way to go! That's service and a great calling card to win my business.

### "overall a nice experience"
Beijing to Hong Kong on Hong Kong Airlines A330. 20.00hrs departure Typical Beijing air control. Crowded and a bit delayed. Not the carriers fault. Only 1 hour behind, but would put us into HKG at 1230 and then to the hotel at 0200. In any case, my first time with Hong Kong Airlines. Boarded quickly, separate doors for business and economy cabins. Seat 15F middle of the aircraft aisle. Warm greeting and beverage offered. Got settled and offered a refill. Nice touch. Nice larger aircraft on the run compared to others. Fully lie flat seats. IFE had decent choices for the 3 hour flight. Full meal service - 3 choices. Beverages and nuts provided, meal served quickly. Refills on beverages without having to ask. Deserts were tasty and ample. English flawless and overall a nice experience. Give them a try

### "deserves it's 4 star rating"
Gold Coast to Hong Kong via Cairns. Check in at Gold Coast was less than 5 minutes. No Lounge Service for Business Class. Left on time for 2.5 hr flight to Cairns. Only a muffin and drink served for breakfast but crew were very attentive. 1.5 hour stop in Cairns. Relatively full flight to HKG. 2 full meal services - 1 hour out of Cairns and 90 minutes before landing. Choice of 3 meals each service with 1 western and 2 chinese. Meals were good portions and very tasty. Plenty of drinks available with crew constantly checking for refills. Daytime flight so didn't take advantage of the fully flat seats, which are very comfortable. AVOD was limited with (understandably) mainly chinese TV shows. Crew were very professional and chatty making for a very pleasant flight. Hong Kong Airlines Business Class deserves it's 4 star rating.

### "recommend enthusiastically"
The flight from Hong Kong to Hanoi is relatively short, but Hong Kong Airlines made it an entirely pleasant experience. I had checked my luggage through from TPE so I can't comment on their check-in staff, but the service and efficiency of the personnel at their lounge and at the gate were exemplary. The flight boarded, departed, and arrived on-time. There were only 2 passengers in business class, so we were attended to cheerfully and personally. HX loses some points for no alcoholic beverage service pre-departure and for very limited selection inflight. Also, the seats are somewhat outdated, but the pillows and blankets were particularly nice, and overall the experience was comfortable. Both meal choices were appealing, and the purser made sure our wine glasses were refilled throughout the flight. I can recommend HX business class enthusiastically for anyone flying into or out of Hong Kong.

### "cabin staff are very kind"
Hong Kong to Beijing with Hong Kong Airlines. It is is a fresh airline company, but the price is cheap and we could enjoy flying with this airline. Their cabin staff are very kind and they could speak Chinese, English and Cantonese. The food was excellent, especially the dessert.

### "cabin crew were nice and friendly"
This was my first time flying with Hong Kong Airlines. Before buying the tickets I read some negative reviews about them but their price was so attractive that I decided to give it a try. Flight from Hong Kong to Bali was on time, departing from the recently inaugurated new terminal at the Hong Kong airport. It was an A300 and there was no entertainment on board. The return flight was an A330 and had entertainment, not a lot of movie selection but had some movies that were quite recent. Seats were comfortable, food was ok and the cabin crew were nice and friendly. The return flight had a little delay but some of the time was recovered on air. During my stay in Bali, my daughter had a barotrauma in both ears and couldn’t fly as scheduled. My husband contacted Hong Kong Airlines office in Hong Kong and after a few misunderstandings, and after sending all the proofs from the hospital we managed to change my flight and my daughter’s at no extra cost. I was impressed with their customer service when an emergency arises. Luckily everything went well and I really need to thank the airline.

### "definitely fly them again"
This was an early flight from Hong Kong to Beijing. Hong Kong Airlines flight was from the newly opened Midfield Concourse Terminal. It was still relatively quiet when I reached the terminal. Boarding was called around 7am, and the queue was relatively long despite it was an early flight. Onboard, all seats are equipped with IFE. Choices and varieties of entertainment may not be as much as Cathay. The monitor of the IFE are not so advance as well. The design of this red cabin looks rather Chinese and conventional, nonetheless, I find the 31 inch seat pitch comfortable and roomy enough. The inflight service and meal are both superb. Cabin crew are friendly and well trained. This was my first flight with Hong Kong Airlines. Given it's low fare, I will definitely fly them again.

### "a short comfortable flight"
Taipei to Hong Kong with Hong Kong Airlines was a short, comfortable flight. I checked in online and bag drop took about five minutes. There was a slight delay, of about 30 minutes, on the flight. Boarding was very quick as there weren't that many people, considering the size of the aircraft. There was a small meal and drinks service which was quite surprising for such a short flight. The seats were comfortable enough, for such a short flight, and the legroom was adequate enough.

### "first and last time"
We arrived at Hong Kong Airport at 0550 for a 0750 flight to Bangkok. Upon checking in at the check in counter was told our flights had been changed to 2205 due to overbooking. We had got up at 4am to arrive at the airport on time. I asked why our flights had been changed when I was holding in my hand a printed copy of my flight reservations. Was told by check in counter and supervisors that flights are overbooked and nothing we can do. They put us on standby for the next two flights, also overbooked, to no avail. We were at Hong Kong Airport for 16 hours waiting for our flight, they gave us each 60 Hong Kong Dollar meal vouchers but would do nothing else for us. I asked to be put on another airline and was told I would have to pay for that if I wanted to. This is the first and last time I will fly Hong Kong Airlines.

### "service is nice as a whole"
I was attracted to the promotion of Hong Kong Airlines recently flying from Shanghai to Bangkok via Hongkong. Hongkong Airlines fleet includes A320, and A330-200/300 Business class seats of Shanghai to Hongkong leg are separate and laid flat to 180 degree, arranged 1-2-1. Business class in A333 is same, but what different is an extra bar in it that was not used during our short flight and seats are arranged by 2-2-2 type. What's more, the seats cannot be laid flat totally. Cabin service is nice as a whole. About food and beverage, I can say that is very good - 2 or 3 kinds of entree choice on menus. Red wine and white wine can be provided to me, but no champagne. By the way, view of Lounge in Hong Kong airport is wonderful, and the location is so good to watch planes on airport.

### "a pretty poor effort"
Flew Hong Kong Airlines from Hong Kong to Bangkok. The exterior of the plane was very dirty. The interior was very red and upon embarkation and disembarkation there was cheesy Asian music playing out of the tannoy system. The interior was rather old and there was no inflight entertainment on board this actual aircraft. The food was pretty poor with just a sausage roll being offered. Every time the captain put on the seat belt sign, the cabin crew would march down the aisle making sure that everyone was wearing their seatbelts. They refused to serve any joy drinks during this time. Compared to Cathy Pacific this was a pretty poor effort.

### "professional and attentive staff"
Hong Kong Airlines trip from Hong Kong to Taipei. Seat 15A in business class on this A330. impeccable cabin cleanliness, professional and attentive staff, very comfortable seat with good entertainment. More than good food and impeccable service. Flight on time and very pleasant thanks to the staff.

### "great service on board"
Another really good travel experience with this young airline of Hong Kong. Web promotion got me very cheap business class tickets from Hong Kong to Taipei. With perks such as lounge access, a generous luggage allowance, great service on board, fully flat bed, nice food and all that. Arrived in Taipei in terminal 2 around 7 pm the terminal is quiet, passed through immigration with no waiting needed, luggage quickly delivered, I was out in less than 30 min. Return trip was as nice. EVA airways handled the check in and offered lounge access at their "The Club" Star alliance lounge. Everything else was the same, in many ways, they exceeded what the other major Hong Kong based airlines in terms of service and attitude. Hong Kong Airlines made flying in business class a possibility with such incredible prices. If they are doing promotions and offer great prices, have no worries and give them a try.

### "very pleasant 2 hours"
Hong Kong Airlines from Hong Kong to Okinawa with a friend, and bought their biz tickets 6 months ago at an excellent price. We were both impressed with the ground service, the lounge and the inflight service, etc. Crew were polite and efficient, meals were average but still a good 7 out of 10 with 3 main choices. The spacious flatbed and 1-2-1 configuration makes flying a pleasure. Aisle access for everyone, that's a plus. A very pleasant 2 hours and we have reached our destination on time. Return flight was more or less the same. They worked hard and maintained their high standard even on a full flight. This is a great airline to travel with on biz class if the prices are right, which often is the case.

### "cabin & service were excellent"
Booked Hong Kong Airlines because the fare was much lower than competing airlines. Check-in was a scrum even for those merely checking in bags. Onboard the cabin decor and the service were excellent. The small snack was fine and I did not expect more. Plane left the gate in Hong Kong on time but there was a sudden jolt on push back when the pin in the push back rod broke. No fault of the airline but it resulted in a 20 minute delay. Add to this the regular delay prior to arrival in TPE due to seemingly interminable one runway operation and we arrived an hour late. For the same reason, departure from Taipei was delayed but flight again smooth and enjoyable.

### "180 degree lie-flat bed"
Hong Kong to Bangkok in Business class with Hong Kong Airlines. The aircraft is parked at a remote bay at HKIA on a rainy day, so got wet as there was no shelter on the staircase to the aircraft. Service was normal, though the aircraft is new with 180 degree lie-flat bed. Food was not bad, but rather a small portion comparing to CX or EK on the same route. Slippers and hot towels were provided. Quite a big improvement and value for money on this airline.

### "5 hour flight was really delightful "
I flew Hong Kong Airlines for the first time in business class, due to a special promotion. My Hong Kong to Denpasar Denpasar flight was slightly delayed for 45 minutes. But we were only 10 minutes late on arrival in Bali, so that was acceptable. On return flight was right on time. Check in was very easy they had a dedicated counter for business class passengers which was almost deserted (beeline at economy!). Their lounge is fantastic, with nice view of the tarmac and freshly made to order food. Ample space to relax and free speedy wifi. Boarding is orderly. Their service is every bit as good as big companies like Cathay and Dragonair. The menu has two choices, and with the local flavour of Hong Kong which was a nice touch. I had two types of seat go to and back. I had the recliner type seat which was actually very comfortable and spacious. Coming back was their new flat bed, much like the smartium seats of Asiana or Emirates business class. Plenty of storage space and comfortable to take a nap on. For a 5 hour flight, this was really delightful considering the great price. AVOD has somewhat limited choice, but for a flight shorter than 5 hours, that doesn't really matter. All in all, they have a very solid product, great to try if the price is kept low.

### "offers excellent service"
We flew Hong Kong Airlines from Chongqing to Hong Kong on a Sunday morning. Check in was fast and friendly, my boyfriend asked for an aisle seat and we got upgraded to exit seats without having to ask for it. Flight left approx on time, flight attendents very polite and friendly, eager to help. Seats were comfortable, plane was quite new. We got a warm breakfast (one choice only) and were served cold and hot drinks. Entertainment was good, no personal screens (not necessary on a 2 hour flight), lots of magazines and even English newspaper. We arrived with a 15 min delay. For flying at such low fares (comparable to low-cost airlines, where  you have to pay for your own food and drinks and cramped in little seats) Hong Kong Airlines offers excellent service.

### "good value for money"
A decent offering which was good value for money. Flight was delayed 2hrs due to Chinese Air Traffic Control. On-board service was friendly and efficient and meal choices and quality were what you would expect for a 2hr flight.

### Hong Kong Airlines customer review
I flew Hong Kong to Taipei on 24th May, then back to Hong Kong on 23rd August. I chose this airline because its airfare was way cheaper than the second cheapest airline at the time of booking. I was aware of its reputation for its tardiness but I still decided to give it a chance anyway. Outbound flight was supposed to depart at 12:10 but got delayed by two hours. However, it was understandable given that there were a lot of flights arriving late from the Mainland due to poor weather. Once I boarded the plane, flight remained on the ground for ages until the captain asked us if there was a doctor on board. None of the flight attendants explained why we were grounded for so long. Long story short, we landed in Taoyuan at around 17:00. Return was supposed to depart at 1450 but was delayed twice and I did not board until 18:15 and landed at Hong Kong almost four hours late. I asked the ground crew why it was delayed and it was the same reason as before minus the bad weather. While the cabin staff (plus staff at the airport) were friendly, inflight entertainment offers quite a lot of entertainment choices for a short flight and comfortable seats for a regional flight, it does not make up for the fact that timekeeping is the worst I have experienced. I wasn't even notified of the delays until I reached the airport, it's obvious that communication in Hong Kong Airlines needs a lot of improvement.

### Hong Kong Airlines customer review
Outside of aircraft dirty but inside new and clean. Cabin crew young and enthusiastic. Full meal despite short (2 hr) flight. IFE acceptable.

### Hong Kong Airlines customer review
I have experienced wonderful hospitality, food and beverage that is above average and quite delicious. The lounge is spacious and with good food, some even made to order. I got the excellent 1-2-1 new style flat bed pod seat, very private and great to relax in for a 5 hours flight. AVOD has limited choice, but for a regional airlines that's ok. Upon return, check in queue is short and efficient, using a shared lounge on 4th floor at DPS airport. The return flight experience was as good as the last. All in all, I am very impressed by this flight and feels confidence to use them again for going to Bali, which is at a fraction of the price to two of the big airlines who fly this route direct.

HKG-BKK-HKG. Outbound Flight HX765 delayed by almost 2 hrs Inbound Flight HX762 delayed by around 30 mins. Flight delay seems to be a norm at this airline. Only pork bun and basic drinks were served inflight. Aircraft's were slightly old. Limited choices of Inflight Entertainment. However the flight attendants are young energetic and eager to serve.

We flew from Bangkok to Hong Kong Hong Kong to Shanghai Shanghai to Hong Kong and Hong Kong to Bangkok. We liked the staff seat and the airplanes. The airplanes were new. We had delays on all flights. The foods were OK. The fares were low. We will fly HK Airlines again.

### Hong Kong Airlines customer review
Shanghai Pudong-Hong Kong then Hong Kong-Shanghai Hongqiao both on A330-200 and delayed more than 1 hour. Seat comfortable and AVOD with a few movies. Cabin crew young and lack of experience no newspaper provided like KA/CX food awful and very tiny size the only reason I fly with HX is their low airfare between Shanghai and Hong Kong.

### Hong Kong Airlines customer review
My route was BKK-HKG-Okinawa-HKG-BKK. All flights offered a bun and juice for meal even lunch time! Due to typhoon no.19 the flight from Okinawa to Hong Kong was rescheduled without prior notice. The first rescheduling from 11.55 to 15.30 is acceptable but then it kept being rescheduled to 19.30 then 2.30 the next morning. Luckily I decided to change my flight to the next day so I didn't need to spend a night at airports. All flights were delayed at least half an hour. My first and last time on Hong Kong Airlines.

### Hong Kong Airlines customer review
Hong Kong Airlines uses two types of planes on their Hong Kong to Bali route. An A330-200 which I flew on as well as a newer A330-300. The -200 series has a 2-2-2 configuration in business class with angled lie-flat seats which is good enough for this 4.5 hour flight. The service is good and the food choices reasonable. The IFE is old with not many movie choices but for a regional flight that's quite decent. This was my first time flying them and I was pleasantly surprised. Although next time I will try and fly on the A330-300 which has a more modern 1-2-1 lie flat biz class seats.

### Hong Kong Airlines customer review
Round-trip from Hong Kong to Okinawa in Economy. The outbound flight was made on an A330 that was so old that there was no button on the armrest to turn the light on and off. (I remember this because a flight attendant who saw me reading asked me if I needed her to turn on the light.) The return trip was on a newer A330 equipped with the latest IFE. However none of the Hollywood movies listed in the airline's magazine was available for viewing so I occupied myself with its games. While this was only a 2.5-hour flight full IFE was available when I flew with HKA on the even shorter route to and from Shanghai in 2012. Beverage selection was good but food consisted only of a bun wrapped around some meat on both flights. Perhaps HKA expected its passengers to have eaten right before boarding? What HKA could do right before boarding is to board passengers by row number so that they won't have to form a long queue well before boarding begins and get in each other's way inside the plane. For short flights (three hours or less) I'd recommend HKA but mainly because of price.

### Hong Kong Airlines customer review
Flew HKG to Bali return and was really amazed by the level of service. Staff were attentive and friendly from the moment I checked in. Staff had even gone to the trouble of memorizing my name and used it in conversation. Very Chatty and good fun! Can't fault them at all other than limited choices on the entertainment! Lie flat beds and massaging seats really completed the experience. No flight delays couldn't ask for anything more!

### Hong Kong Airlines customer review
We had read a few reviews of Hong Kong Airlines and went with some trepidation to Hong Kong airport to check in to HX 775 to Bangkok on Tuesday June 3. Do you remember the good old days when there were attentive check in staff and delightful personnel to greet you and look after you once on board? Well that is exactly what we had from the moment that we arrived at the counter until we disembarked in Bangkok. We could not fault the airline at all. And more to the point we had exactly the same on our return to Hong Kong on HX 776 on June 9. Admittedly we were in Business Class (and I really recommend paying the extra to fly up front) but since the flights took off and landed on schedule and the crew were excellent all through I doubt that anyone sitting behind us would have had any complaints. Well done Hong Kong Airlines we'll certainly fly with you again.

### Hong Kong Airlines customer review
HKG-TPE-HKG short trip due to super low fare and co-promoted with AMEX. Check in was smooth but located at far end at HKIA T1 Aisle K. Flight delayed for a relatively short period. Board the A330 at remote gate 523 was a chaos. Inflight service was okay cabin crew young and friendly but seemed inexperienced and lack of conversation. Food was the worst part of the journey. Good point was the A330 with AVOD and new seat comfortable.

### Hong Kong Airlines customer review
I unfortunately encountered what HK airlines is most notorious for flight delays when I was flying Hong Kong to Taipei. The plane went on to circle around the airport for a good 30 minutes. They didn't provide a proper meal either (I guess because it is a short flight) and most of the inflight entertainment they promised was not delivered either. I could only use the TV after 45 minutes into the flight. On my return trip we arrived 42 minutes before boarding but they wouldn't let us on. Their terms and conditions stated CLEARLY that the counter will close 40 minutes before the boarding time. Staff just waved us off and told us to call their hotline. We requested to be put on the next flight their staff told us "there is no next flight" and made us leave. We had no other alternative than to stay in a nearby hotel and pay an extra 300 USD for a one way ticket the next morning. To sum up our experience we had a dilemma and clearly nobody bothered to help. I'll be sure to never take HK airlines again. Go budget at least they're willing to assist.

### Hong Kong Airlines customer review
PEK-HKG-PEK - Really painless and quick check in on both ends. FAs were very attentive and were great communicators. A330-300 is in great shape and is a beautiful plane. Leg room isn't great in coach but it was far from uncomfortable. Food is quite decent and the IFE was excellent. They had great English language selections - far more than could be watched in the ~4hr flight duration. Flight was slightly delayed from HKG to PEK but captain agreed to wait for passengers arriving from a different flight - I don't mind being delayed

### Hong Kong Airlines customer review
We are aboard flight HX775 flying from Hong Kong to Bangkok on 16/04/14. It has been delayed by almost an hour already firstly for a technical delay and then waiting for a passenger in transit. There has been very little communication and the internal crew have been clueless. If you're planning to fly with Hong Kong Airlines do not expect to be on time. We were delayed by 45 minutes leaving Bangkok and heading to Hong Kong as well. Really not good enough.

### Hong Kong Airlines customer review
I tried this airline for the first time on a plane from Beijing to Hong Kong. I arrived at the airline counter and they wouldn't let me on the plane because my ticket didn't have my middle name. The counter agents would not let me on until I called the booking agent to change my information. I had bought my ticket on the airline's website so I had to call the same company even when their agents were standing right in front of me. I told them my situation and they charged me $300HKD to update my name information and would not budge on the fee and could not answer why it costs $300 to update my name besides continually citing "procedure. They wouldn't refund my ticket and said they would not let me on the next flight if I missed my current flight because of this issue. It felt like they were holding my travel plans and money hostage and were extremely unethical in their treatment of this issue. I would never use this airline again. I could understand if this was an issue out of their control but their policy service and how they treat a customer is appalling.

### Hong Kong Airlines customer review
We flew as a family of 4 from Shanghai to Hong Kong and then the following week from Hong Kong to Beijing and we were happy with the flights. The website was good and easy to use when making the booking. However I couldn't see anything about the luggage allowance. It turns out economy passengers are allowed 2 pieces of luggage - so our 5 suitcases between 4 was fine. The check-in was easy - with no queues at either check-in. The plane was modern with individual entertainment. We watched recent films on each flight. We were fed a meal on each flight which whilst not exciting - was fine and the staff were pleasant and helpful. The prices are similar to European 'cheap' airlines and yet the flights service and comfort are all much better here. Would absolutely recommend if you need to use this airline.

### Hong Kong Airlines customer review
Flight HX283 from TPE-HKG. Hong Kong Airline was the worst airline that I've travelled with. On the day we flew back to HKG the flight was delayed due to a typhoon in HKG. The staff of BR (EVA air) served us well while we were waiting to board. In Hong Kong the plane had to go-around 3 times FA's had no explanations. I feel so disappointed with this flight.

### Hong Kong Airlines customer review
The worst airline I have ever travelled with was delayed by an hour going to Hanoi and 2.5 hours coming back. No apology no explanation for either journey. Was told I couldn't sit in the front seat with extra legroom (when the plane was loaded and locked) even though the seats were empty. The food was awful - literally bread and water there was no inflight entertainment. Staff were okay but just operate like robots and don't actually care. I will never travel with HK airlines ever again if you read this then I advise you to use a much more reputable company like Cathay/Dragon.

### Hong Kong Airlines customer review
Flew BKK to Hong Kong. Outbound received a complimentary upgrade to business class. inbound flight was full so stayed in economy. On both legs the service was excellent. Inflight entertainment in both sections was a pleasant surprise on such a short flight. Food was also better than that served on a lot of more prestigious airlines. Enjoyable experience.

Worst airline company I have tried and I travel a lot. The service was extremely bad I flew from Hong Kong to Hanoi and back. Both flights were delayed with more than 2 hours each in fact the flight from Hanoi was delayed more than 3 hours even though its only a short flight. The crew at the destination and in Hanoi didn't do anything to solve the problem. So first and last time I am travelling with Hong Kong Airlines service is a non existing word in this company.

### Hong Kong Airlines customer review
Our flight Sanya to Hong Kong was over four hours late resulting in missing our connection to North America for which we had allowed five hours. A typhoon had blown through the day before which they initially tried to claim as the cause then eventually admitted it was a local ground operations issue. Nobody at Sanya airport had the ability to communicate competently in any language but Chinese and the Hong Kong Airlines staff on the ground admitted that they did not know why their plane was being held on the ground for three hours without boarding (there was not a mechanical problem).

Bali to HKG in October in business class. Excellent all round given cost of ticket - flight was on time comfortable business class seat entertainment was not great but acceptable standard and best of all - service was excellent. I had some trepidation having read some of the negative press on this airline but I was very impressed. Compared to the cheap airlines in Europe and America HKA is a class above in my opinion.

### Hong Kong Airlines customer review
Guiyang to Hong Kong a terrible flight. First the flight was delayed about 2 hours they provided some food and beverages which was appreciated but the food looked terrible. Onboard blank stares replaced the usual "welcome aboard" with only one flight attendant actually welcoming passengers. The seat was comfortable enough for a short hop but it was on the hard side. When the meal service started there was no choice of a drink and the only sign of food was a terrible pork bun with the pork seemingly mashed together into 2 balls that looked as if they were compressed. There was also no in-flight entertainment. Setting aside the terrible welcome I received the cabin crew were great they were not robotic and were friendly.

### Hong Kong Airlines customer review
HKK-HKT return. Better than expected. Delayed one hour on the way to Phuket which seemed to be because we were waiting for connecting passengers. IFE practically non-existent just TV episodes on an overhead screen which I couldn't listen to as there were no headphones but for a 3 hour flight I don't really care. Cabin crew were pleasant. The return journey left on time again with pleasant cabin crew and quite a decent breakfast was served. We landed early. My only real gripe was the highly annoying jingle which they played on a loop at top volume on the outward flight. All-in-all decent value for money.

HX529 September 12 2013. Booked Hanoi - Hong Kong. On the departure day we had no idea the flight was cancelled no communication from the airline whatsoever. We had to call the airline to see that the flight was indeed cancelled since the airline website was utterly useless and they tried to have us fly the next day which was unacceptable to us. We asked them to put us on the Cathay Pacific flight on the same day and they said they would call us back. A few hours went by and no word so we called them back. The woman on the phone had the audacity to say we had contacted them a few days ago to try to cancel our flight and get a refund which was a lie. Eventually they got us on the Cathay flight. This was a classic case of "you get what you pay for". We booked with Hong Kong Airlines to save some money but will do so again we will rather spend the extra money for less stress and better service with other airlines such as Cathay.

Had booked Hanoi - Hong Kong - Hanoi 4pax. Before even getting to Hong Kong the return flight was cancelled 5 days before the original date of the flight 'due to operational reasons'. Offered a flight with them for the following day which didn't suit our itinerary then offered a flight the day before the original: again this was cutting short our few days in HK. Left it with them to sort out another flight on the original day. No response by email or phone for several days. Went for the outward flight from Hanoi: all checked in and waiting at gate then flight cancelled due to 'operational difficulties' This was 10pm. They were going to put us up in some random hotel until the following day same late evening departure but after much waiting protesting following counter staff through the airport to collect bags and be re-admitted to Vietnam some passengers with onward connections seeming to go off on another flight they eventually got us on Thai Airways to Bangkok to get their own BKK to HKG flight at 02.30. So we got to HK at 06.00 about 8 hours late. I then had to make several calls whilst in Hong Kong to get them to sort out a return flight which eventually came through with Vietnam Airlines. I will avoid booking HK Airlines in future.

First and last time flying them. First time visiting Shanghai choose HX because of their departure time (Friday night back Sunday night). From HKG to Shanghai our departure time was supposed to be 9pm and land at 11.30pm. As we got to the departure gate we were waiting to be called but it was 9.30pm and there was no announcement ground staff told us delay was due to typhoon after 5mins we got onboard but we were kept waiting (no announcements from Pilot). Told we would take off at 11pm plane landed at 1.15am. On the flight back from Shanghai to HKG departure time 9.10pm we were informed there would be no delay but again there was a long time waiting at the departure gate. Got onboard at 10.15pm and after doors were closed there was no signs of push back. At 11.30pm we finally took off and landed at 2.15am.

### Hong Kong Airlines customer review
June 29 flight HX775 departure 12.15 from Hong Kong to Bangkok and July 2nd flight HX766 departure 20.25 from Bangkok to Hong Kong. Both flights substantially delayed (respectively more than 3 hours for the flight to Bangkok even if officially it was rescheduled for 14.30 and 2 hours for the Hong Kong flight) which needless to say has been causing inconvenience. On the return flight the delay was such that we arrived in Hong Kong at 2am. At that time of the night the 'Airport Express' is not in service. I had to take a taxi. Adding to this poor service at check-in for both flight exhibited nothing but incompetence and lack of organization. This was the first and the very last time I was flying Hong Kong Airlines and I will not recommend it.

### Hong Kong Airlines customer review
HKG-PEK return. Seats are comfortable enough. I especially appreciate the sensitivity of the Entertainment touch screen. Entertainment is enough. Cabin crew also serves well as I saw them being very helpful to teach another pax to use the goods sold on SkyShop. The only demerit I had to state would be lack of beverage. There's still improvement on the taste of breakfast (fried egg is unsatisfactory).

Purchased Business Class round-trip BKK-HKG-BKK as they had the lowest fare and convenient times. However for a business class product it was not as good as other carriers on this route. On check-in I was not offered the security/immigration "FastTrack" that I always get on other business class flights out of BKK. When I asked they said it was not available for my fare code. I found this unusual since I paid a full-fare refundable fare. After further complaints they gave me the FastTrack pass. I did get the invitation to a 3rd party Business Class lounge which was quiet and offered a fair selection of drinks sandwiches warm snacks and fruit. Flight departed 2.5 hours late and there was no explanation. Onboard the captain announcements sounded competent and assuring. A330 had nice lie-flat business class seats. The business class cabin was only about 20% full. The flight attendants were good and provided a nice friendly service hot towels before departure and after meal. Had a nice hot Thai meal with white wine. Coffee wasn't very good. The entertainment system was not fully functional. The "Hollywood Movies" section had no movies so I watched a Japanese movie with English sub-titles. On arrival at HKG we parked at a remote location and we had to take a bus to the terminal. This seemed inconvenient at first but actually was quite nice as the bus takes you direct to the immigration area and you don't have to take walk far or take the shuttle train. Overall it was an ok Business Class product for the price but not what one would expect from Cathay Emirates or Thai who fly the same route.

### Hong Kong Airlines customer review
HKG to Sanya return. My outbound flight delayed an hour without announcement. Boarding was a little rushed and chaotic. A330 airbus seating was not bad even had AVOD (although mine didn't work). For a 90 min flight all I got was a tiny hot dog wrapped in foil (not on a tray) a small cup of water only one round of tea not even coffee. Absolutely no other drinks offered. It felt like a budget airlines although the ticket price matches other carriers such as Dragon air or CX. Service was lukewarm. On return the plane was even smaller they served a hot dog again very stingy indeed but I was prepared this time by eating before boarding. No IFE only overhead TV. I will only fly with them if their prices are cheap and there are no other choices for that route.

### Hong Kong Airlines customer review
Flew PEK-HKG in economy. The airplane itself was comfortable and new. Seating for economy was adequate enough if not a bit generous! Entertainment options while limited were enough for 3 hours of flying time. Those were about the only 2 positives from this flight. Flight attendants were disengaged and not interested in passengers. It took 5 yes 5 different requests to get one beer from them. During the process of asking for the beer one flight attendant rolled her eyes at us! Food for the flight was inedible. While the price may be right I wouldn't go out of my way to fly them again.

Flew last weekend from Shanghai (Hongqaio) to Hong Kong returning to Shanghai (Pudong). Was apprehensive after reading reviews on this site. Was pleasantly surprised both flights boarded on time there were the inevitable delays on taking off from both Hongqaio and Hong Kong but these airports are infamous for congestion. Both flights landed on time. Meals were good on both legs although no alcohol served which doesn't really matter on a 2 hour flight. Service was good on two full planes (A330's both ways). Good PTV although sectors not long enough to enjoy full movie-stuck to TV programmes instead. Overall pleased with the service provided-will fly them again.

Return sector HX764 Phuket-Hong Kong. Business Class 23 Jan 2013. Not advised of schedule change: Flight scheduled to depart at 03.30am. HX hotline advised flight was cancelled Phuket handling agent advised flight would depart at 01.00am. No response from either as to why they had not attempted to contact me. Lounge facilities: On previous occasions use of the "coral Lounge" was provided. This time I was guided to a table at a small snack bar. Flight: Online check in revealed limited seating choice. In the event I was alone in Business Class. One can assume that no one was notified of the schedule change as Y class appeared lightly loaded as well. I was dozing seat reclined listening to my ipod when I heard the landing gear being lowered. I raised the window blinds saw HK lighting: Seat back to upright earphones off and noted that the cabin crew were absent [although I could hear them chatting] and that the galley curtain remained drawn. Overall: The lax attitude to passenger handling of high yield passengers is difficult to accept. This was not my first experience of HX 'Premium' service however it has been my last.

HX374 / HX375 from HKG - KWE (Guiyang China). Flight delayed 30 minutes they said it was due to the heavy traffic at HKIA. On return to HKG the plane was delayed 3 hours again the delay is because of the heavy traffic in HKIA. The "meal" onboard was only bread with ham - ridiculous.

My first return flight Beijing-Hong Kong was cancelled due to bad weather and so as my replacement flight 2 days later (all 3 HK Airlines flight cancelled out of 4 total on that day). Impossible to contact any staff on the phone and no response for my voice and e-mails. I gave up after a couple days and travelled back with another company. Finally the company replied by e-mail yesterday after a few weeks saying they are sorry weather beyond their control etc. and they offer a luggage belt as "souvenir" to compensate for all the inconveniences!

PEK-HKG. This was a very average airline and I would not go out of my way to fly them again. The seating felt very cramped the flight attendants seemed to lack that high level of customer service but again nothing that was hard to deal with. Not sure why an airline like this gets 4 stars where other airlines I've flown on international legs (Delta United etc) only get 3 stars. This didn't feel any better. If you get the right price though don't hesitate to fly with them.

I have booked to fly twice with this airline. both times flights have been cancelled. First time was in June we were taking an early flight to Bali and was informed via e-mail with less than 48 hrs notice that the flight was cancelled and we were put on the much later flight. Very surprised to find that on the return flight there was no entertainment for the same 5hr flight? The second time my wife and I and my wife's parents are booked to fly HKG - Hanoi on the 4th October 2012 and return Hanoi - HKG 8th October. I have received an e- mail today to say that both flights are cancelled no apology and no advice on alternative travel options. I quickly looked for alternative flights that meet our requirements ( work in HK and domestic flights in Vietnam into consideration) and found one Dragon Air flight and one Cathay flight that suited. I called the Customer "help" line suggested they transfer us to these flights to be told that HK Airlines do not have an agreement with Dragon Air or Cathay. They instead asked us to take HK Airlines flights one day before the outgoing and one day after the return date to which I said no. We will never be booking with HK Airlines again.

Phuket-Hong Kong August 29th. Aircraft arrived from HKG on schedule. Passengers boarded quickly and the plane left Phuket on time (02.45). Most passengers choose to sleep straightaway but water tea coffee and a hot snack was offered. Arrived HKG ahead of schedule at 06.55. Plane parked on tarmac and bus to HKG immigration. Luggage arrived within 30 mins of landing. When this flight is on time I would say value for money. There are advantages to a night flight. But I can imagine the discomfort when this flight is delayed. A320 with 144 economy seats and 8 "business class.

### Hong Kong Airlines customer review
We had a weekend break from HKG to Phuket and the flight was overbooked. 14 people were left without a seat on a plane holding at the most 300. This is a calculated approach by the airline - they know that they overbook but continue to take the money. We were only flying away Friday back Sunday so the idea of arriving a day late - the offer made - was a joke. I would not recommend anyone flying this airline until the stop overbooking.

### Hong Kong Airlines customer review
Last week I was flying to Beijing and they delayed the flight 5hrs with the reason being that they needed a new plane? I had to fight for over 30 mins to be transferred to another flight (Dragonair). Was finally transferred and thought that would be the end of that however on the return flight two days later the same excuse was used and there was another 3 hr delay on the return. The thing that made my blood boil wasn't the lack of organization or the pathetic excuses they made it was the ground staff who rolled their eyes and tutted when I complained and asked to be put on a flight that was leaving on time. I also spoke to other passengers and they had delays of up to 10hrs with the same level of service. If this level of service continues and the amount of delays this airline experiences remains then I think this is an airline will soon be out of business.

London-Hong Kong Route. Originally booked a return flight for late August/Sept 2012. Found out by chance that Hong Kong Airlines is to suspend this route last week. Tried to check on their website in need all flights has been 'Sold Out'. Tried to call directly to their offices in HK where no one ever anyone picks up the phone! Called their London office staff wouldn't give out any information at all they only say they are doing re- scheduling and cannot give any further info. None of the passengers bought tickets have been contacted! Extremely poor communication and 200% un-reliable. Luckily I bought my ticket through Expedia called them and they in turn contacted the airline and confirmed that the London Hong Kong route is suspended indefinitely from Sept! Expedia managed to get the airline to refund the ticket price in full! but this will take 2-12 weeks! very inconvenient! Will never use even for a short Asian trip!

Round trip flight: Beijing-Hong Kong-Taipei Taipei-Hong Kong-Beijing. Every single flight delayed. PEK to HKG supposed to depart at 7.40 am instead delayed until 9 am due to plane maintenance. Because of this I missed the connecting flight to TPE which was scheduled for 12 noon. I had to wait until 5 pm for the next flight - also delayed more than an hour. Coming back TPE-HKG only delayed 20 minutes. HKG-PEK at first I was notified the flight had been changed from 8.15 pm departure to 7.30 pm. I arrive for the 7.30 departure to find out the flight is delayed until 8.50 pm. It is currently 8.30 pm and they have not started boarding yet. When asking for an explanation for flight delays you get the usual "the previous flight was delayed" or "there were airport issues". Flying with them has been the worst experience I've come across in all my travels.

Had several flights with HKG Airlines in the past year and every single one of them was delayed. The worst one was last night supposed to fly out HKG-PVG at 9.30pm but did not take off until 1am! Their excuse? Always the same due to the late arrival of the aircraft. Ground staff last night even tried to lie by saying there was a thunderstorm in Shanghai which I knew from a friend in SH and the weather forecast that there was no thunderstorm. Since we will not arrive in Shanghai until 3am due to the delay ground staff in HKG promised there will be shuttle buses provided from the Pudong airport to four different downtown locations in Shanghai. What happened when I arrived in PVG? The promised services do not exist! It was almost 4am and no one we can talk to. Some of us tried to stop flight attendants who were marching out of the terminal to find the answer again with no success. In the end we had to catch and pay for our own taxi. Agreed with other passengers not worth the money at all and will not fly with them again.

Delayed 14 hours supposedly because of the bad weather both in Hong Kong and China but other airlines managed to take off with a delay of about two hours. Communication terrible and there were numerous updates (17.00 20.30 23.00 and 01.00 ) followed by further cancellations despite being told the new time was confirmed. Destination countries were not told about changes so my driver also waited 14 hours and even staff at the gates did not know what was happening. I have since been looking on the Internet and delays are still up to six hours which is unacceptable. A miserable start to my trip plus I missed a night at a hotel.

Shanghai PVG to Hong Kong. A330-200. Check in experience was good. Given priority service due to being injured and on crutches. A wheelchair was arranged and I was escorted through immigration to the aircraft for early boarding. FA's were friendly helpful and provided very good service. Good choice of entertainment for a short flight. 2 choices for the lunch service was a pleasant surprise. Quite happy with the amount of leg room in the seats for economy. Had a stand off position upon landing in HKG and had to try and make my way off the aircraft using the stairs after I was told that there would be a lift organised. Staff were very helpful with their assistance in getting me off the plane and on the bus. A wheelchair was waiting at the terminal and I was again escorted by staff through immigration baggage claim and out to the exit. A very pleasant experience overall. The only negative though the flight was delayed by about an hour.

Took HKG Airlines twice ie 4 flights and every single one was delayed. Best' was 1hr delay worst 7.5 hrs (arrived in Bali at 6am instead of 10.30pm. Can't fault the ground staff but the airline has some serious organizational problems. Never going to fly them again - any dollar saved you need to spend triple in food at airports taxi late at night etc.

HKG-LGW. Took Hong Kong Airlines new club classic after 4th day of launch. Food was great with lots of superb choices seat was very good with soft cushioning and comfortable recline. Received Bvlgari amenity kit. Aircraft was A330-200. There was a bar which served lots of wine and beverages. Inflight entertainment was good although some sections were still under construction.

Roundtrip from Hong Kong to Shanghai in economy. IFE including VOD was extensive but the 2 hour flight each way didn't allow me to fully enjoy it. Food was average but adequate. The beverage selection was somewhat limited. Service was good. On the return trip my flight was delayed for 2.5 hours.

BKK-HKG-BKK Business Class. Very surprised that this airline did not offer any alcoholic drink throughout the flight. On the way back to BKK there were no movies at all only TV programs. Service was very slow and inefficient. Food worse than mediocre. The only thing I liked was the seat - it's angled-lie flat yet comfortable. For a flight of 2.5 hours I would prefer to fly economy class with TG or CX. This was not worth the money.

Hong Kong - Sanya return. Great airline attentive crew modern aircraft and comfortable seating for short flights. Business lounge in Hong Kong is brilliant for such a small airline. Unable to fault the service or experience. Some bigger airlines could learn a great deal from them.
