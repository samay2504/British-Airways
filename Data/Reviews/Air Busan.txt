### "definitely recommend this airline"
Not Verified |   Apart from the fact that the crew at Incheon were a little rude, everything was perfect. For a low cost airline, the seats were very comfy and the legroom was amazing. I would definitely recommend this airline.

### “now starving in the plane”
They took us in to the plane at 12.30 pm. After closing the doors they announced that there is problem we have to wait 1 hour. After 1 hour they said there will be additional 1.40 hours. There is no food in the plane, they expect us to sit here for long times and starve? We came here for travel, I understand that it is not the airplanes fault but we lost our whole day and now starving in the plane. I had never have such bad experience with plane! How hard to get some snacks from the head office or somewhere else?

### "No meals, no inflight entertainment"
Clean plane, but no water served for a 6 hour flight. No meals, no inflight entertainment. Seats have USB charging which is good, but even for a budget airline, i would  expect a bottle of water and maybe a snack. I won't be in a rush to fly with Air Busan any time soon. Check in staff seemed to be unsure about visa requirements and kept me waiting for a long time (longest check in I have experienced).

### "totally indifferent crew"
Clean plane, totally indifferent crew, but what is absolutely amazing is that, on such a long flight, the flight attendants did not distribute a single drop of water to passengers, except to those will to pay for overpriced items; not even the cheapest low cost airline(and this was not a low cost) would do better.

### "closed the counter 90 min prior"
Seoul to Kuala Lumpur. When we arrived at the airport 90 min before departure time, the  counter was empty. Nobody up there and the automatic check-in was disabled. After walking all over to find their offices, we were greeted by an employee who told us they closed the counter 90 min prior to flight as a company policy. There was no effort on her part to open the door or offering any alternatives. I dislike that attitude in any kind of service.

### "no problems with this airline"
Seoul to Busan. First time with Air Busan and it was great. Price, App, check in, employees, service,luggage and on time. At the check in I was offered an earlier flight, no fee. There were no problems with this airline and trip. Recommend.

### "Great value budget airline"
Osaka to Busan. Great value budget airline. Web site and on-board magazine promise free water but none was offered. Check-in at KIX was about 20 minutes, check-in at PUS was zero with no other customers in sight. Offered decent seats even though we hadn't pre-booked them. Outward flight was delayed due to 'air traffic control restrictions' at KIX but landed on time due to timetable padding. Return flight left early but landed slightly late after circling around western Japan for ages. Boarding on both flights smooth. Bus to terminal at PUS, but sky bridge on return flight. Perfectly adequate and reasonably efficient for a budget airline and a one-hour flight. Would use again.

### "efficient and excellent"
My family flew to Daegu from Gimpo. From check-in to boarding, service rendered by all staff were efficient and excellent. Cabin was clean and seats were usual economy class comfy. On our return flight from Daegu to Gimpo, we were late due to traffic and could not check-in thru self serve kiosk. We had barely 15 mins prior to flight departure. Approached counter staff for assistance. First thing the staff did was radioed the Captain while processing the checking in and printing of boarding passes. An agent came over to escort and assisted us throughout the procedure to ensure we boarded the plane without further delay. All these were completed within 15 mins and flight departed on time. Our biggest compliment is towards the Captain for both flights. Journey was smooth and landing was perfect which you dont even feel the plane has landed. Flew with many major top 10 airlines in the world but never had this landing experience ever before. Cabin Crew rating, great and comparable to top airlines! Keep it up and will definitely choose and fly Air Busan on all my destinations where served by Air Busan.

### "was a disaster"
Today in morning when we were coming Jeju to Busan, it was 10 minutes late, which is acceptable. But after this when all the passengers were in plane and it start to run, they stopped. We were informed that there is an issue and pilot will take plane back. We were kept waiting another few minutes and cabin manager announce that they are looking into it and will give further notice. Crew members were serving water and juice. Further notice kept happening for next two hours and plane finally moved at 12:35 pm, instead of 10:30 am. It was my first time to fly with Air Busan to Jeju, which was a disaster.

### "they don't have aerobridge"
Flew Air Busan from Jeju to Busan. No delays - my experience of taking budget airlines gives me an impression that they will surely delay. They served orange juice that was quite nice onboard. Smooth landing at Busan. I slept on board. But they don't have aerobridge like Korean Air, Asiana Airlines or Jeju air.

### "customer service appears to be top "
We were in Jeju flying to Busan then connecting to Gimpo. I noticed our flight was delayed and we may miss the connection. I queried this with ground staff. Within 16 minutes our flights were changed (at no cost), 4 people's luggage located, dragged across the airport, by tiny female ground staff, identified and reloaded then we were seated in row 1 of the airline and off to Gimpo. Totally amazing. I am still astounded that this happened. Plus a refund on our original flight. Congratulations Air Busan. If I could I would fly this airline regularly - customer service appears to be top of their list.

### "check-in staff were incredible"
We highly recommend the staff at Jeju airport. We were booked Jeju to Busan, Busan to Gimpo. Our flight from Jeju was delayed and we would have missed our connection in Busan. The check-in staff were incredible when we queried if they could assist us, they changed our bookings to a direct flight with only 15 minutes to do this. 2 lasses retrieved our luggage (for 4 people, not light) from the original flight, hauled it to the check in desk so we could confirm they had our luggage & all correct, then down onto the tarmac into the plane. This was all completed within approximately 15minutes. It was brilliant of the staff. They were crediting us with the change flight we had incurred earlier and missed the button - it become a payment, - this was not an issue for us, it was only $37.00 Australian and the service those girls gave us was quite unbelievable. Flight was good too.

### "one of the best budget airlines"
Gimpo-Jeju and Jeju-Gimpo. One of the best budget airlines I have flown with thus far. Air fares were cheap. The seat was really comfortable for such a short distance and legroom room was really spacious (more space than SIA). Beverages were served despite the short flight and FAs were very friendly. Airport staff very polite when we were checking in. Definitely fly with this airline again in the future.

### Air Busan customer review
I recently flew Gimpo - Jeju and Jeju - Busan and what a great experience! Fares were cheap included baggage and when I changed my flights to spend more time in Jeju I only had to pay the fare difference. The seats were the same pitch as Qantas (31") flights departed close to schedule and drinks were served despite the short flight time. The only slight criticism I have is that their website is a bit tricky parts of it rely on Flash which may be why I couldn't get an English version to load on my mobile device also whenever I tried to put my passport details in I got an error - if this happens try selecting "No passport" this worked for me. I'll definitely choose them again if I'm flying their routes - great effort!

### Air Busan customer review
PUS-GMP 737-500. The weather was deteriorating and we were caught off guard by a typhoon heading our way. We got rebooked for free quick and friendly service. At the gate the flights would all be cancelled. The flight was bulk loaded pilots ready. The first delay occurred as extra service agents were called to the gate and were providing information to the passengers. After an hour delay we observed extra pilots boarding as well we learned the captain after deliberating safety being his major concern decided to fly out. A quick boarding nearly full flight and we took off in heavy winds and weather while dark. Despite the weather the pilot remarked thanking us for coming along for the ride saying Hang tight and nice flight which broke the tension. Even though it was a bumpy flight the crew were really calm and nice which calmed us all they spoke English too. It's times like this they must remain calm and they did. Not one time did we feel anything other than our safety was what was most important. A very capable and friendly airline.

PUS-CJU B737 Short flight from us an to Jeju Island. Left and arrived on time. comfortable seating. No food served; just a 50cc bottle of water handed out. No inflight entertainment.

### Air Busan customer review
I flew with my family from Fukuoka to Busan for a holiday. Although we stayed for a night in Busan and then flew to Seoul the next day the airport staff were very helpful and friendly they helped me reserve seats for the second route with leg room. The ticket fee was still attractive even though it was during their New Year. No choice for the drink (only Jeju orange juice) inflight. No delays.

### Air Busan customer review
FUK-PUS return on an aged 737-400 clean and offering reasonable leg space. Check-in courteous despite I arrived pretty late. No inflight service for such a short flight they served orange juice but it was not necessary to do so if fares go lower. They have an interesting selection of duty free shopping on the plane it's worth trying it. Uneventful trips and luggage arrived safe and sound. I'd wish they offered more routes into Korea from Fukuoka. Very user-friendly website that allows to catch good fares and per it's seat selection. Flying BX was a nice surprise.

### Air Busan customer review
PUS-GMP. User-friendly website made the ticket purchasing easy. Departure delayed 20 minutes but the plane arrived on time in GMP. Orange juice and water served on a very short flight. FAs were friendly and efficient. Seat pitch and leg room may be a bit tight but I believe it's common for an LCC. Overall a great choice for those who want to take a domestic flight in South Korea.

### Air Busan customer review
Busan to Jeju. Flight attendants great and tried to have a little fun with the passengers. On the way they served drinks (water/juice/coffee) and a fortune cookie. They also had some kind of draw for a few different gift certificates. Airplane very new and in excellent condition. Seats were quite close together so my legs were almost pressed against the seat in front of me even though it wasn't reclined (if you're tall it might be irritatingly tight). Overall though a pretty good airline and I will fly with them again.

### Air Busan customer review
Very good considering the fares. I even wonder when they serve drinks on a 50 minutes flight (Seoul - Pusan). I'd rather have a cheaper ticket.

### Air Busan customer review
Very good friendly and uncomplicated service. Like the fixed prizing. Makes you wonder why it has to be so stressful travelling in Europe with the likes of Ryanair etc. Would always choose Air Busan again.

### Air Busan customer review
Air Busan was what I would expect from a LCC. Seat pitch a little tight but enough for me. Flight attendants a little abrasive but you can't judge an airline by one flight attendant! Overall good airline and it serves its purpose well; affordable no frills flying so that is what you should expect. South Korea is small so flights with Air Busan are only in the 1 hour range!

### Air Busan customer review
GMP-PUS-GMP. Very good fast efficient and friendly staff. At GMP ground handling done by Asiana so all the traditional quirks of this great airlines. Served water and OJ on this very short flight.
