### "handled my delayed bag terribly"
Air Corsica handled my delayed bag terribly. At Bastia airport 40 people waited up to 1 hour to be seen by a baggage claim agent. MY 50 minute wait plus the 35 minutes spent filling out forms meant there were no more airport buses or taxis available to the city. An additional wait for a taxi brought me to my hotel 2 plus hours late. I had to waste even more time buying replacement items needed till my bag would arrive the next day. And the Air Corsica site for reclaiming these expenses was unusually user unfriendly, illogical, and demanding unreasonable amounts of documents. Once submitted I received a message saying that because of the high volume of demands there would be a 6 week delay for a response! There was never an apology or explanation for the delayed bag. Air Corsica is stuck in another century in terms of customer service.

### "Extremely poor customer service"
Not Verified |  We were expected to travel from London and Paris to Calvi, all booked together on family holidays. Air Corsica suspended all flights from London giving only two weeksâ€™ notice and did not accept to refund tickets from the third passenger travelling from Paris. The third passenger could not travel alone, and we also had to cancel accommodation and car rental resulting in additional costs incurred. Extremely poor customer service, many emails and phone calls since September. Lots of time and money lost and extremely high frustration.

### "there were no inflight service"
You can change your seats at e-check in without charge. Both flights were on time. A320neo was clean, there were no inflight service for the 1 hour flight. Stewards were efficient and friendly enough.

### "trying to receive compensation"
Bastia to Stansted. Group of 8 flying as a family. At check-in, Air Corsica staff mixed up baggage tags so they did not correspond to the correct individual. Air Corsica then decided not to load a full trolley of luggage on to the flight to ensure it was not delayed. 4 out of 8 bags did not arrive at Stansted within our family (alongside numerous other families that were also missing bags). We proceeded to inform staff but as the luggage tags were on incorrect bags due to incompetent staff, we could not make it as clear as it should have been on the missing bag forms. 3 out of 4 bags arrived within 5 working days. Our bag has never been recovered. Air Corsica have then proceeded to make it impossible to track it down or receive a refund for lost luggage. Website does not allow you to save or upload correct information so 4 times we had to restart our request. They refuse to speak English on the phone. After we finally processed the refund request, they sent one reply saying the bag had been returned and therefore the case was closed. They then closed the request without even contacting us and so we therefore had no way of appealing this. The bag has never returned. We have now had to go through our insurance provider but even this is being made difficult as they aren't even able to get hold of Air Corsica and as our luggage tags were incorrect we are having to speak to multiple insurance providers that we took insurance out with even though it only affected one of us. We flew in September 2019, are now in February 2020 and are still trying to receive compensation for our luggage.

### "Excellent all round"
Stansted to Ajaccio. Excellent all round. On time, drink and a snack served, no hassle to board or have onboard bags. Seats were comfy for a 2 hour flight - fare reasonable. Would recommend.

### "Overall I was satisfied"
I flew from Marseille to Ajaccio. Overall I was satisfied. The outbound leg was carried out with an ageing but very well kept ATR 72, and the return with a recent A320. Both flights were on time and the crew was polite and smiling. Given the short duration of the flights, both around 50 minutes, the inflight service consisted solely of drinks, but that's fine. The basic fare always includes a checked in luggage and the price was correct: I spent 118 euros return to fly on mid-July booking just 4 weeks prior to departure. The only minus was the long waiting time to collect the luggage at AJA (25 minutes despite having just 2 aircrafts to unload), but I don't blame it on Air Corsica.

### "don't expect much from this flight"
Flight XK101 on December 25th. Like every year going back home, there were long queues at the check-in counters due to understaffed service on Christmas Day, which caused a 30 minute boarding delay for just a 40 minute flight. Aircraft was as tight as usual. 100% full. Don't expect much from this flight which is just a hop across the Med. Onboard crew is OK, but ground staff are slow. Propeller aircrafts are very noisy. Service onboard is 1 drink. But, most of all is how can the airline justify such a high price 190 Euros (non flexible tickets) round trip for only 2x 40min flights. Prices are more expensive than ever despite the very low cost of fuel.

### "assisting my wife and I"
On September 4th 2015, we had reservations to fly Air Corsica from Calvi to Nice. Then we had connection on Alitalia to Rome. Our connections were very tight with only 45 minutes in Nice. Weather on September 4 created much confusion. The Air Corsica flight from Nice to Calvi was delayed 1 hour and arrived at 10:45am. We were going to miss our Nice to Rome connection. We expected to be staying the night in Nice. We departed Calvi 1/2 hr late. Fortunately, the flight from Nice to Rome was also delayed. The Air Corsica agents in Calvi arranged for an agent in Nice to assist in having my wife and I meet Alitalia agent. That agent escorted us through security to our gate and we made the Nice/Rome connection. We arrived in Rome only 1/2 hour late and all of our bags (4) arrived perfectly.

### Air Corsica customer review
Short hop from Nice to Calvi. Hardly any people onboard. Crew were not particularly friendly or welcoming but we were served a cookie and soft drinks. Landed smoothy although slightly delayed due to a missed approach. However tickets were cheap and luggage included. All in all a decent experience.

### Air Corsica customer review
A good trip. I did Paris-Orly-Calvi and Calvi-Marseille. These trips were fairly good staff at the airport and cabin crew where very good. Biscuits and a drink served onboard (totally normal for the time of the flight which is not longer than one hour and a half). However the seat was really small.

### Air Corsica customer review
Paris Orly. Full fare ticket in Economy class on both sectors as no other airlines fly this route due to the "public service" law requirement. It is 100% affiliate with Air France and same basic service on their flights : a drink with some savoury biscuits. Nice-Ajaccio small regional aircraft very old and extremely noisy. Cabin crew average. Served one glass of water and nothing else. Ajaccio-Paris Orly a glass of apple juice with some savoury biscuits in a typical A320. Staff at the airport extremely helpful but crew quite average hardly noticing you. For this price the service is below standards and would consider the ferry boat !
