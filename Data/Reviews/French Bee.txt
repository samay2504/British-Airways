### “What a colossal mistake!”
We recently flew French Bee from Miami to Paris Orly, lured by the promise of lower fares compared to our usual airline. What a colossal mistake! First, their website is painfully slow and not user-friendly—just booking tickets felt like a chore. At Miami Airport, check-in was disorganized and stressful. We brought an extra checked bag, knowing there’d be a fee, but were shocked when we were charged a whopping $140 for it! Once on board, we were stunned by the narrowest seats we've ever experienced on an international flight—truly uncomfortable, with hard bottoms and barely any room. And we are not large people. Anyone taller or broader than average, beware. The cabin crew were unfriendly and dismissive. Food options were terrible, portions ridiculously small, and everything else—from a coffee to a blanket—came with extra fees. Want a basic cup of coffee? That’ll be €2.50. Unreal. On our return flight, things went from bad to outrageous. We had the exact same carry-ons we flew out with—1 rolling bag, 1 backpack, 1 tote handbag between the two of us, all within the airline's published limits. But at boarding, we and 8 other passengers were stopped, scolded, and told we’d have to pay $240 or we wouldn’t be allowed on the plane. When we tried to explain we were within limits, the gate staff became aggressive—my husband was pushed by one of them and told, "Pay now or you don't fly. It was blatant extortion, and all of us were furious and shocked. In the end, we were forced to pay under pressure just to get home. Once back on board, the same cramped seats and bad service greeted us again. We’ve never felt so mistreated by an airline. The bullying, hidden fees, and lack of professionalism make French Bee a complete disgrace. We will never fly with them again, and we strongly urge others to stay far away. If saving a few bucks means being treated like cargo, it’s just not worth it.

### "never use French Bee for my travels again"
I had a terrible experience with Frenchbee during my trip to Paris. We purchased our seats a month in advance, only to find out at the airport that our seats had been sold to other passengers. When we inquired about this, we were told that purchasing seats online doesn’t guarantee their assignment. We showed them our receipts, but that didn’t help us at all. The customer service was appalling. While Vanessa was the only staff member who was somewhat helpful, the rest of the employees were rude and dismissive. It felt like they didn’t care at all about our situation. I will never use French Bee for my travels again!

### "extremely disappointed"
Not Verified | I recently flew with French Bee from Orly,France to Newark, NJ and was extremely disappointed with the experience. The flight itself was uneventful, but the check-in process was a nightmare. When I arrived at the entrance gate, I was informed that my luggage was overweight and my backpack was too big and that I would have to pay an additional $148 to check it in. I was not aware of the weight limit and was not given any warning when I booked my ticket. The staff at the check-in counter were unfriendly and unhelpful, and seemed more interested in collecting the extra fee than in assisting me. I felt ripped off and frustrated by the experience. The airline's policy on luggage weights and fees is not clearly stated on their website, and I believe that they are taking advantage of unsuspecting passengers like myself. The agents at the gate were very rude and treated me that I might lose my seat if I don't pay before the door is closed. I emailed and emailed the customer service and was a waste of my time. I will not be flying with FB again and would not recommend them to anyone. The extra fee for my luggage was a significant inconvenience and added to the overall stress of my trip. I expect more transparency and fairness from an airline company, and fell far short of my expectations.

### "absolutely terrible experience"
Not Verified |  I had an absolutely terrible experience with FrenchBee. I was forced to pay over $200 in fees to correct a simple typo in my name (an unnecessary “S”). What’s worse is that they charged me twice — once for the outbound flight and once for the return flight. This policy makes no sense and is clearly designed to exploit customers. The process to fix this took over 3 hours on the phone, with multiple calls needed to finally get it resolved. The inefficiency of their customer service is beyond frustrating. To make matters worse, our flight was delayed by more than 2.5 hours with no proper explanation or compensation. Overall, this was one of the worst travel experiences I’ve ever had. I strongly advise anyone considering flying with FrenchBee to think twice. If this issue isn’t resolved with a refund for the unnecessary name change fees, I’ll make sure to share my experience widely so others won’t fall victim to such poor service. Avoid this airline if you can! My flight cost me $1900, it’s a complete shame

### "unfairly flagging carry on bags"
Not Verified |  French Bee the need for greed, the rudeness, unfairly flagging carry on bags that meet regulation when dropping off pre paid luggage, the total check in experience a night mare, & have passengers sitting @ cancelled boarding stations that were moved somewhere else and I was a waiting passenger that made other passengers aware that it was changed.

### "no free water"
Ignoring customers and no free water on an 8-hour flight? Our meal tickets meant nothing because apparently thwy "ran out" of food. And then, $462 for 3 bags ONE WAY, plus damaged luggage? Not to mention, jamming carts into our arms and ignoring us like we weren’t there. One family member was even entitled to a free drink, but no I get it, charge for soda, fine. But water? That’s next-level ridiculous. If you hate your job that much, do us all (and yourself) a favor: quit, find a new passion, and let someone who actually cares about customers take over. It’s time to step up and actually show some class—because right now, Frenchbee’s doing the opposite. Be better!

### "We had a great flight"
Not Verified |   We had a great flight with French Bee, from Paris back to NYC. We booked late for our first ever Europe trip, so we didn't want to buy expensive tickets. We took a risk going with French Bee, since it's cheap, about $250 one way. We were nervous, seeing all the bad reviews especially with cancellations. Turned out to be an awesome experience,  on time, good foods, no turbulence.

### “Worst airline ever”
I paid for premium economy with last down seats, yet they booked me in basic economy at the back of the plane. They said to file a claim on the website, which doesn’t work. Food is terrible. Worst airline ever.

### "worst client services"
Not Verified |   Worst company and worst client services ever. Never use it. I am a US-citizen, based in the US. I made a reservation on their website (english version) and made a mistake during my reservation regarding an overnight flight. I called 5 minutes after to indicate that I made a mistake and wanted to book the overnight night flight leaving in the early morning (1AM), instead of the one leaving at night (11PM). The customer service told me that I made my reservation under a French website (?!). I indicated that I was on an English website and my ticket was written in English and fare indicated in USD. However they maintained that the 24-hour cancellation policy only because the English website I used was French (?!) and that the US laws regarding 24 hour cancellation was not applicable. Crook company. They only proposed me to buy a new ticket and no reimbursement possible.

### "I arrived two minutes late"
Not Verified |   This is not a good airline in flexibility, respect for the client. My experience with this airline is very poor. I arrive two hours prior my departure time with enough time for me to check in the flight. The check in personal not helpful at all. They stated I arrived two minutes late therefore, the flight was closed. The flight was already booked and my tickets gone, and they did not allow me to rebook unless I pay more money in to embark 3 days later. I had to rebook with another airline having to pay additional charges. Not a happy experience. Furthermore the person off the front desk was miserable in service with me, there’s no refund from the flight, nor credit.

### "I won't be flying French Bee again"
The flight and service on the flight was as expected for a budget airline. The food is extremely overpriced and service is minimal (bring your own food if possible!). The seats were more comfortable than I thought, which was probably the biggest surprise. My big complaint is that our flight was delayed three hours, which caused my family to miss our connecting flight and spend the night in a hotel. I asked several times to get compensated for this hotel stay but they did not do so. I guess $130 is worth losing customers for life. I won't be flying French Bee again.

### "You could end up stranded"
My daughter took an outbound flight from LAX to Paris on December 17th, 2023. Everything went well on the outbound flight. However the return, scheduled for February 9, 2024 to go from Paris to LAX is a different story. On January 5th I received an email from French Bee stating they were cancelling all flights between Paris and LAX until March 31st, 2024. Consequently, I had to purchase a one way return flight on another carrier to get home which ended up being more expensive. This is completely unacceptable. They did not even offer to put my daughter on another carrier, only that they could either reimburse the full cost of the return ticket, or get a voucher plus 20% for future flights (there is no way I will ever use this airline again). When I try to access my booking online to request a reimbursement the system says "an error has occurred". When I try to call the company for 4 days straight in a row, no one answers and the call disconnects after about 1 hour. I have contacted my credit card company and am now disputing half of the charge for this flight as they are clearly making it as difficult as possible to get reimbursed! True, their fares are very enticing, but it is not worth it to fly on this airline. You could end up stranded and have to pay a lot more at the last minute to get home!

### “No help. No apology”
Not Verified |  NEVER been treated so badly. Worst airline ever! Cost us several thousand dollars. Arrived in Paris from Madrid flight (different airline) on our way back to US and had to self transfer our luggage between airlines & terminals. We were checked in with French Bee and just needed to print luggage tags and drop luggage (had prepaid 2 x $110 per 50 lb bag so $220!). We arrived 80 min before flight and kiosk said check in was closed. We asked a couple of employees and both said, check in was closed for the flight. We said we were checked in and just needed to drop 2 bags. They refused to help and sent us to the “help” desk who told us we were too late and luggage had to be dropped 90 min before flight, so at 80 min there was nothing they could (would) do. Told us to buy another flight and next one was in 2 days. There were at least 3 other passengers at the help desk in the same situation. All screwed. No help. No apology, just snotty, entitled attitude. With losing our hotel in Newark, Uber to other Paris airport, new flights, plus over $1000 paid to French Bee for fares and baggage for 2 of us, ended up costing us apx $3000, hours of major stress trying to get home and 2 brutal days of travel, all because we couldn’t drop our bags 80 min before the flight. I’ve flown numerous airlines domestic and international, dozens of times and never experienced anything like this. Absolutely disgusting way to treat customers or people in general. They screwed us over unbelievably and not the slightest bit of care from a single employee. I’d recommend anything other than using them.

### "I had my flight cancelled"
Not Verified |  We arrived literally seconds after they decided to close the gate meaning we still had time to board. Getting go the gate was a mission unto itself as nothing is listed. We get to the gate and the manager immediately begins to talk to me and my partner in a rude manner. Says our carry on was over the limit, yet when we came in from Newark they allowed it with no problem. He then proceeded to try and charge us $100 per bag. Reluctantly I was going to pay as I needed to get home, I tried to negotiate with him to just charge us for both bags since we were strapped for cash. So I’m offering my Apple pay since that’s where the money was and he refused to charge me, ironically everywhere else I’ve been we used Apple Pay with ease. He refused our entry and we were stranded in another country. I then call customer service to try and rectify this and they say that I’m blacklisted. No rhyme or reason. So now they won’t even return any of my money and I had my flight cancelled. If anyone reads this and they are thinking of flying with this company, I urge you to look elsewhere.

### "unequivocally the most horrific flight"
Not Verified | I booked a return trip on French Bee from Paris to New York in June 2023 on booking.com. First time with that company, but I have been flying hundreds of times across all continents for 59 years, from a Breguet deux Ponts in 1964 as a toddler, to A380 Emirates first class as a corporate executive in 2018. My weight of 83kg is normal for my height of 1.86m. I was excited to fly the A350, in my first transatlantic flight since the end of the pandemic. French Bee was unequivocally the most horrific flight experience of my entire life. FIRST, arriving at Newark, I had to choke up $200 on top of the ticket price for our two midsize luggage. SECOND, I had booked and paid extra for extra legroom on an emergency exit row. The actual layout of the cabin was entirely different from the booking map, and when I asked to be relocated so I could fit my leg in length, I was told by the crew to suck it up or get off the plane. The crew also blamed Bookings.com for the wrong cabin layout? THIRD, French Bee crams an extra seat in width in economy (10 seats across instead of the standard 9 seats of the A350), so not only I lacked legroom, but also the width of the seat was reduced by about 1/9 to fit that one extra seat in width – by the way, thank you to Airbus for enabling that. FOURTH, I am not going to comment on absent service, dehydration in flights, and so on. Just imagine the worst you can fathom. I will never ever again fly French Bee, I would rather stay home than subject myself to ten hours of torture and insults. QUESTION: at what point will the regulators step in for minimum comfort standards, so that some airlines stop carrying passengers like cattle to the slaughter house ?

### "never been charged that amount of money for bags"
Not Verified |  We were arriving in San Francisco from Cleveland when our flight was delayed. We still arrived an 1 hour and 45 minutes before our scheduled flight with French Bee. United let us off the plane before anyone else to catch our flight with French Bee. I immediately started trying to check us in online (I was unable to previously because the website was not working), when I found out I was still unable to check us in due to the website. I then started making phone calls to the check in desk at the airport. I called nine times while waiting for my bags. No one ever answered at the French Bee desk. I grabbed my bags and ran as fast as I could to the French Bee counter (still with 1 hour and 30 minutes left before my flight). When I arrived, the counters were shut down and there was no one there. I inquired with AeroMexico where they had gone, and they only could tell me they shut the counters down. We arrived with plenty of time to catch our flight but there was no one to check is in. I begged and pleaded with anyone who could help me find a French Bee attendant and couldn't find help. Security told me that I would have to rebook my flight even though I was on time. French Bee only flies to Tahiti every couple of days. So, I had to purchase an Uber and a hotel room in San Francisco for the night. I then had to buy a whole new ticket with United for the next day or I would have missed three days of my trip versus one. I called customer service with French Bee multiple times and didn't get an answer until the next day. Customer Service told me they couldn't help me and I could only file a complaint by email. I had never heard of this! Not even customer service to help me? Fast forward to the end of my trip. I had tickets to fly home to San Francisco with French Bee again. Once again, I tried to check in online ahead of time but the website was down. Arrived at the French Bee counter in Tahiti and I was told I would have to pay $330 for three bags because I didn't check in ahead of time. The lady at the counter who worked for French Bee was so terrible to us, we couldn't actually believe that someone could treat us so horribly. I have traveled to over 40 countries with the same exact bags and never been charged that amount of money for bags. When I asked why, she said because I didn't check in online. She didn't want to hear it when I told her that the website wasn't working. She didn't believe me.

### "window for check in luggage has closed"
The ground crew had the worse customer service ever. Even I have my boarding pass and seat confirmed, they required us to be at the airport 4 hrs prior in order to check in our luggage. We arrived slightly before the 2 hrs prior of our boarding time, they refused us checking in our luggage because the window for check in luggage has closed. The crew kept pointing us to the long line and wasted our time instead of helping us to get the luggage checked in. Finally we were at their customer service counter and we realized the long line has the same issue like us - denied of checking in the luggage. They gave us 2 ridiculous option: 1) Fly without our luggage (since we had our boarding pass and ready to go) or 2) change to the next flight by paying a fee (our initial flight is still in the airport and boarding time is still 1 hr later). We are forced to pay an additional fee to get the next flight so we can fly home with our luggage. They refused to waive the fee. I understand if we came late where boarding is going on but we are talking about 2 hrs prior. I felt being scammed by this airline.

### "Absolutely awful customer service"
Not Verified |  Awful airline. Do not fly with them unless you want a train wreck of an experience! They cancelled an entire return flight without telling anyone. No message, no email, they just let everyone arrive at the airport so that they could tell people one by one that the flight is cancelled and to come back the same time 24 hours later. Absolutely awful customer service.

### "seats were not very comfortable"
Not Verified | Everyone was very nice, the food was good, the seats were not very comfortable it felt small. Both trips were an hour late which was hard. The second trip they kept us standing in a really warm room for an hour. I think that really did it for me. My fare was not really cheaper than other fares…being in that hot room was very uncomfortable. I feel like they charge too much for the dinners and breakfasts. There was no WiFi.

### "My husband said he’d rather take a boat"
The plane was more than two hours late and the communication for what we could have expected as passengers would have been appreciated. We bought the second tier of Wi-Fi (the social package) and it stopped working for both of us within 20 minutes of the flight. The first meal is provided but anything other than water (juice, coffee, snacks etc) you have to pay for. I expected to have to pay if you wanted alcohol or specialty items, but juice and coffee? That seemed ridiculous to us. Speaking of which, we did try to order champagne but the card reader couldn’t connect to the Wi-Fi so we couldn’t buy anything anyways. The plane also ran out of water which is unacceptable for an 11 hour flight. I would never fly this airline again. If it was the only option, I’d find literally any other way. My husband said he’d rather take a boat from America to Europe before flying French Bee again. I will say the flight attendants were very nice, but that doesn’t really count for much with everything else the airline is lacking.

### "close for boarding passes 1hr 30 mins before departure"
To call it “bad customer service,” would be the understatement of the century. This was not to be believed. The SNCF train, which took me from mid-France to Paris, was delayed. I still ran like the devil to get to the airport in good time. Went to check in at 1:30PM, exactly 1hr & 20 mins before the scheduled 2:50PM departure. I was in utter disbelief when I was told they were not going to give me a boarding pass because they close for boarding passes 1hr 30 mins before departure. That is only a 10 minute difference! They didn’t care that there was plenty of time to get to the gate. When I asked if there was any recourse, I was told that I could go to a customer service line. When I got there, I found dozens of other people in the same situation. The recourse was to buy a new ticket. Forget basic customer service. What happened to the days when they would actually rush you through to get you on that plane? I paid extra to get on the flight the next day, and I also had to pay for a hotel that night.

### "Terrible experience altogether"
Terrible experience altogether. We have a small child who was sleeping in his stroller and the RUDE lady at the bag check had an extremely poor attitude. She said we had to check our stroller then and couldn’t check at the gate. Never heard of such a thing and was certainly not the case flying to Paris. She became quite nasty and was screaming at my wife. In the end, we woke our child, checked stroller and carried him through the numerous check, long lined check points. I paid for priority boarding, but that doesn’t matter because once they open the gate, everyone runs to board the plane. French Bee did not board first class, priority, etc., prior. It’s a free for all. You’d think that on an 11 hour flight you’d be offered some sort of beverage, ie., soda, juice, coffee… NOPE, you have to pay for all drinks… ALL. Same for anything to eat.. no snacks offered. It also seemed they needed to make an announcement regarding no smoking quite often… very strange. Would I ever consider flying French bee again? Absolutely not.

### "In flight service was attentive"
Family of 5 (2 small children + parents and grand mum) Los Angeles to paris return. Check in was easy Boarding was easy. Great service even though we were late to the Gate. In flight service was attentive, courteous and helpful. Reasonably priced and food was tasty. The aisles are slightly narrower but good leg room. Plenty of overhead storage on both flights. Plane had new entertainment equipment and felt new, great value for money. Pro tip: make booking with hot meal it’s worth being included or bring ample snacks, drinks, and meal/ cup of noodles from airport/home.

### "avoid your airline at all costs"
Shortly After Flight BF 730 took off, the pilot announced that there was a “mechanical issue” and therefore the plane had to return to Orly. There was no elaboration of the nature nor the impact of the issue on the flight. Once on the ground, we were instructed to claim our luggage. It then became obvious that the flight was not leaving at all when the staff began handing out vouchers for a nearby Marriott. The staff was not sure we would be on a flight the next day because they had no information about crew or aircraft availability. They went on to say there would be a bus to transfer us to the Marriott, but they had no idea when it would be available, so we took a taxi. The remaining passengers arrived at the Marriott by bus between 10:30 and 11:00pm, not having had food or water since before boarding the flight. We were treated like merchandise, not as paying customers. At 5:00am the room phone rang and we were told to be in the lobby by 6:00am for a bus to take us to the airport. When we got downstairs at 6:00, there was no bus; it finally showed up at 6:30. Frank has mobility issues and we were told that there would be plenty of help for us. That help never materialized, either at the hotel or at the airport. We checked in and were informed that flight BF 5731would leave at 10:30am. There was no help available to get Frank all the way to the aircraft; we were taken to an area one level up from the gate, but the elevator to the next floor down was out of service. Eventually the operator of the lift truck showed up and put us in his vehicle. The flight was further delayed because the catering had not been delivered. We finally boarded and the flight left around 12:30. Unlike on our outbound flight, we were seated in the seats we paid for. The flight crew was OUTSTANDING. They were efficient, friendly and very helpful, one of the best cabin staff we have experienced in many years of air travel. They deserve better management than they currently have with French Bee. The theme that comes up repeatedly in the above fiasco is the abysmal level of management communication. It is ironic if not ridiculous that, in a company which relies on precise communication to ensure passenger safety in the air, that there can be such poor communication. It is highly unlikely that we will ever book a French Bee flight. By the same token it is very likely that we will warn others to avoid your airline at all costs.

### "Do not recommend"
Never got to take the flight. We had booked the flight for 29 August 2023. French Bee did a schedule change, which cancelled the flight-- then things went poorly. We had booked the tickets through AMEX. When we called AMEX to see what we could do once the flight cancelled, they called French Bee to get the flight moved to a day earlier. Somewhere in that process French Bee took over the reservation. Our plans changed late last week and I called AMEX to get the flight changed. AMEX has no access to the record now, since French Bee 'owns' it. They told me to call French Bee. I called them, after a 30 minute hold a very stressed and unhappy agent was going to process the refund, then abruptly told me since it was an agency booked ticket AMEX would have to do it and then she just hung up. That fast. I'll try AMEX one more time, then I guess I'll have to dispute the charges. French Bee isn't a company you want to work with. At least we didn't have to get on the plane and deal with the non-service attitude. Do not recommend.

### "French Bee won't see me again"
Worst experience ever! First, our flight was delayed for about 1h. Then they boarded us and we took off. But after about 1h of a shaky flight, the pilot announced that there was a technical problem and that we had to return to Paris. So after about 2.5h in the air, we were back where we started, but happy to have made it back in one piece. A lot of chaos back at Orly in Paris, took another ~6 hours before they found hotels for some of us, most were told they should look for their own accommodation. About 10 unmotivated staff speaking no or poor English trying to manage some 400 agitated passengers. Worse, we had no clue what would happen with our flight to LAX, though they promised another attempt the next day. Sure enough, at 6.28am they sent out a text message and email saying there would be another flight at 10.30am. Short notice, esp given that nobody said it would be that early. Another problem, many passengers were shuttled (after ~2h wait for the shuttle) to their hotel rooms at CDG airport, which is ~1.5h away from Orly (!). It is now 10am and we just got informed that our flight would be delayed. Deja-vu! Hope we make it back in one piece, one can feel anguish, perhaps fear among the passengers. This operator seems technically unreliable and has unprofessional staff. French Bee won't see me again, to say the least.

### "one party had their ticket suspended"
It’s so bad. They tried to tell us we couldn’t fly because one party had their ticket “suspended”. What did that mean? The man at the counter wouldn’t explain. He threatened to “call the captain and not let us on”. Keep in mind we’re a family of 4, just standing there trying to figure out if our vacation was ruined. Almost on the verge of tears, my Mom was, after planning this Tahiti trip for a year. The man laughed at us and said we needed to buy another ticket. Right there and then. For $800. Seeing no other choice, we did just that. A minute later, the man gets on the phone and says “they've activated your old ticket. Maybe you’ll get a refund in 24 hours.” We got a refund a week later. This man was combative, rude, and mean.

### "they don't care about business"
Rude check-in staff and gate staff. Their baggage check-in software stopped working at the check in counter and they blamed on it saying we checked in late. But we had already checked in at another counter and had our physical boarding passes and bag tags. So how can they say we checked in late. And then at the check-in counter, nobody is helping us check in bags and kept pointing us from one supervisor to another. At one point, they pushed us aside and stopped speaking to us when we are clearly trying to converse with them. I wish I had the names of the staff who ignored us and left them on our own, so I could list them here. Anyways, we didn't want to miss the flight just because they aren't checking in our bags. So, we just took the bags to the gate hoping we can ask them to check in at gate. At the gate, we met with much ruder staff who told "we cannot fly today and our ticket is cancelled". They put us in a security check area and made us wait for 20 mins. Then after much verbal fighting, airport flight supervisor came in and heard us out. He finally helped us by allowing baggage drop at the gate. The French Bee staff were still looking at us like criminals and we gave feedback directly that the service is bad and they treated us rudely by lying that "we cannot fly today and ticket is cancelled" or if they really did cancel, why did they cancel without our permission when we already had our boarding pass and bag tags. To that feedback, they were still not sorry or acceptive, they just said fly Air France next time. So, clearly they don't care about business. We aren't flying with them anymore.

### "Absolutely terrible airline"
Do not fly this airline. Delayed two hours and then had to return to original airport after an hour due to technical issues. Absolutely terrible airline.

### "$100 for one baggage suit"
The worst company I have ever seen. Took $100 for one baggage suit, when their website write it cost $50. Also small child took a seat a lot of rows apart. Manager was very rude, and said " it's your problem. I can't do something

### "We wanted to upgrade"
Worst experience ever. We wanted to upgrade. We were told to do it at the airport. We arrive 5 hours early. They were nothing but incompetent. They charge $400 to seat from row 11 to 6. They said not available in Premium economy . We arrived are the airplane. Many empty seats on first class. Delay 5 hours in Paris Delay 3 hours in Miami. Not worthy. Don’t travel in this aircraft.

### "the worst way I’ve ever been treated"
The level of service we received from French Bee on June 10th at Orly airport was the worst I’ve ever experienced. I was traveling with my husband my 4 year old daughter for a 3 pm flight from Orly to Miami. We just got married in France and was coming back from our Honeymoon. As we were checking in a young lady snatched our boarding pass from us stating one of our carry on was too big. If that’s the case, that wouldn’t be a problem for us to pay. The problem was that she pulled our boarding pass from us and ran with it. When I tried to get the ticket back from her, the manager got involved and call airport security. He falsely stated that my wife hit the agent. When airport security looked at camera footage and saw that was not true they actually had the agent apologize for a false claim. Even though we didn’t do anything wrong, we got kicked out of the flight. I had to book another flight for my family. That was the worst way I’ve ever been treated. After the situation the manager did admit that the agent was partly wrong for how she handled the situation, but the damage was already done. I had to book 2 other flights and it took us 24 hrs to get home compared to our 8 hr flight. The manager could have handle the situation, but for some reason and he made it worst and got airport security involved. I was embarrassed by airport security, treated like we were criminals in front of my 4 year old daughter. That was all due to a false claim that was later proven from camera footage to be a lie. Never I will never again flight with them.

### "terrible experience"
I had terrible experience with French Bee! I was trying to check in online 2-3 hours prior my flight but it wouldn’t let me. Then I came to Newark 1hour 25min earlier just to find out the checking closed exactly 1,5h before flight (including self checking). The French Bee representative left me without boarding pass! Marked me as NO SHOW, and declined refund! And I was inside Newark asking for help right until my flight left for over an hour! I wasn’t the only passenger, two other people also were left behind by French Bee for the same reason. French Bee is a scam! Do not book!

### "fine for a budget airline"
French Bee is fine for a budget airline. Airport airline staff in Paris were rude and unhelpful. Cabin crew were polite, friendly and professional

### "not by flying with French Bee again"
The flight to Paris was mostly ok, except it was delayed for about 45 minutes while police came to remove an unruly drunk passenger. However, the return flight was by far the worst experience we've ever had with an airline. We had purchased extra leg room on the bulk head, and upon getting to the seats there was a large service dog that took up the space in front of my wife's seat (and even part of the space in front of my seat). Not just the extended leg room portion which we purchased, but alk her leg room (see picture). French bee should have a policy that if a service animal is over a certain size, the passenger must purchase two seats. I essentially paid for this guy's extra space for his service dog! (Again, my wife had to move to a seat without extra leg room). When we pointed out the problem to the flight crew, although at least 3 different members came over to look at the situation and all did the "hmmm, I see the problem" thing, none of them did anything about it. My wife eventually just moved to an open seat on her own. When we asked for a refund on the difference in price between the extra leg room and economy seat (an extremely reasonable request), we received the following response: "First and foremost, we regret the inconveniences you had to face as regard your flight BF720 on 04/30/2023. Service animals are trained to do work or perform tasks for the benefit of a qualified individual with a disability, including a physical, sensory, psychiatric, intellectual, or other mental disability. Therefore, passenger seated next to you was allowed to have his dog outside a cage. In this instance, we must respectfully deny your request. Needless to say, we will not by flying with French Bee again. Buyer beware.

### "professional polite and very friendly"
I did a round trip between Newark and orly. After reading what reviews are out there I didn’t know what to expect. The economy seat, I’m 6’1 and 260 lbs and I fit just fine. It may have been a little bit less room than on one of the major carriers but it certainly wasn’t torturous I felt just fine. This is why reviews that exaggerate and say oh unless you’re under 100lbs you won’t fit are not helpful! The seats had a good recline too. The crew both ways were extremely professional polite and very friendly. My recommendation would be to order the chic bistro meal ahead of time on their site they provide a nice meal. If you don’t order the bistro meal (which is an additional charge) you will get a standard meal if you book the smart fare and this also entitles you to check in a bag. If you choose the basic fare however no meal or checked baggage is included. Snacks and drinks are also available for purchase on board. The seats all had seat back entertainment with movies music games etc.. French Bee is owned by the same company that owns the airline Air Caraibes and in fact our outbound flight from Newark to Paris was physically on an Air Caraibes plane while our return was on a French Bee plane. I think they May sometimes swap out the planes (all the same type A350s) between the two airlines. The only real complaint we had was that if you check a bag , the bag drop isn’t really a bag drop it’s more a you print out your luggage tag at the kiosk and put it on and then you wait online to see an agent anyway to give them your bag and go through the whole check in process all over again. This moved kind of slowly especially at Newark . Like I started off saying I didn’t know what to expect but I found them to be a nice little airline.

### "happy to use them again"
Excellent comfortable flight with great staff. Incredibly good value for money. Tasty meal included with ticket, water free but other drinks chargeable. Would be happy to use them again.

### "best airline food I’ve had"
Not Verified | I was a little worried after I’d read all the reviews but honestly, it’s not as bad as everyone is making it out to be, I have flown with worse airlines. I had as good as experience I could have had on a 10 hour flight. I’d recommend to pre purchase your meals. We didn’t, but we’re able to purchase some on the flight and I will say, it’s some of the best airline food I’ve ever had!

### "really is no value to airline"
Flyer beware. This is a bait and switch airline. They will provide many excuses beyond the customers control for not being able to deliver what’s on their web site like; it’s labor issues, mechanical issues with new modern planes, really? How is that the customers problem. We arrived late to the USA because they changed to a smaller plane which didn’t have the same amenities as our outbound trip. When I contacted French bee about the differences I was offered $20/pp off a total fare of $3,400 for our group of 4. What a joke. There really is no value to airline. I will pay more on my next trip on another airline.

### "This airline is fine"
This airline is fine. My family of four (2 adults 2 kids) flew Miami-Orly and back for spring break. We checked in online and were all seated together. We didn't check bags, so I can't speak to that experience, but no one was weighing carry-ons on the way back. The boarding process is a little chaotic, but everyone got on the plane eventually. We did pay extra for meals (and checked bags if needed, but because it was unseasonably warm, we were able to manage with carryons), and the food was slightly better than average. Flight attendants all nice. International economy flights are always kind of unpleasant because they're so long, but there was just nothing exceptional about this experience. Seats seemed like the usual size to me--I'm on the small side, but my husband is over 6' and said seats were okay. He feels a bit cramped in any economy seat, but he found French Bee seats no worse than average.

### "The aircraft was very spacious"
I was asleep most of the flight. I must add, there was a lot of turbulence during the flight, more than I’m used to and I’m an experienced flyer. I also would like to add, please come at least two and a half hours before the flight, since it is international. I saw a lot of negative reviews based solely on not knowing this piece of information and the crew not making exceptions. The crew are really nice. One of them spilled water on me, I’m unsure if she apologized or not because it woke me up from my sleep. But she handed me some napkins to dry myself off, so I’m assuming it was an accident. The aircraft was very spacious. I had a lot of leg room, the seats actually reclined, and you’re able to view the plane from different angles via the camera that are set up on it. I’ve never seen a feature like that before and thought that was pretty unique. All and all, if I’m ever going to Europe again, I’m flying with them for sure.

### "The worst flight ever"
Not Verified |  Left from Miami with my family including a baby (5 people in total) paid for special seats for both ways, from Miami to Paris the flight was fine. On the way back from Paris we were obligated to pay to bring the baby carseat back 100 euros (I never had to pay to bring a carseat on any airline not even on the way in) and they also changed the airplane and left us in coach seats and all separated including my children. We tried to complain and explain that we had paid a different class of seat and that we had a baby and little kids on the plane they didnt care about at all. The worst flight ever. Horrible plane with no tvs, flight delayed we were in the plane with kids for 12 hrs with no outlets, Tvs. Just garbage.

### "French Bee is not family friendly"
Terrible check-in process. Staff in Paris are not motivated and each employee makes their own rules. Security agents also make their own rules and you end up with chaos and staff yelling at passengers in every direction. French Bee is not family friendly. They do not allow strollers at the gate. You have to check in and will not have your stroller with you. We had 2 very young kids and a pregnant wife. The staff did not care and refused a wheelchair. With an infant on our lap and a pregnant woman we were almost last in the plane and asked to put our bags under our seats. This is when we raised our voices and told the airline to have some common sense. Once in the plane we asked for water as my wife felt unwell after all this chaos. We were told to wait for take off. Ended up waiting for 2h for a cup of water. Once in Newark our wheelchair took 45 min to reach the plane. The staff was begging us to move so passengers on the next flight could board. We did not move otherwise we would never get the wheelchair.

### "Very pleasantly surprised"
I wasn't quite sure what to expect, having read mixed reviews, but I needed a cost-effective way to move myself, my daughter, and our two small dogs from the US to the UK via France (it's much easier to get a dog into the EU than it is to the UK, and then cross the border from there) and French Bee seemed to fit the bill. Very pleasantly surprised! All the staff we encountered, both at the airport and on board, were extremely pleasant and helpful. The gentleman at Newark who checked us in- two stressed people, two stressed dogs, and a metric ton of luggage. The flight was packed to the gills with rude people and slightly delayed, but it was the holidays. For the extremely reasonable price (I was able to get two people, two dogs, and six checked bags to Paris from New York for less than $1500, the week before Christmas), the plane was comfortable. This is one of the few flights I have been able to sleep on, so I did not make much use of the entertainment system, but it seemed robust. I did pay for breakfast in the morning, which was nothing over the top special, but not bad and much cheaper than buying something in the airport. The overhead bins were huge and seemed to accommodate a lot more luggage than normal. And for a budget airline, the experience wasn't much different than what you would get from a large legacy carrier, Most importantly, my dogs arrived safe and relatively unbothered by their adventure, though I had serious concerns about them flying in their crates (they are too large to fit in carriers under the seat). Thank you to the staff who handled them so well and kept them safe!

### "plane was horribly uncomfortable"
Our flight to Paris from New York area was delayed. A substitute airline, Wamos- became the operator. The Wamos plane was horribly uncomfortable, dirty, had no wi-fi, no screens, poor air circulation, meals paid in advance were not served. The following evening our daughter flew the same route with her children and had a worse Wamos/French Bee experience. Her plane was 2 hours late boarding, sat an hour on the runway and the inflight time which should have been, at most, 71/2 hours turned into an 8 1/2 hour ordeal as they slowed the airspeed by more than half. Prepaid seating was not honored and the family was split up. I would not recommend anyone use this airline.

### "good value for money"
Not Verified |  Despite seeing poor reviews, we decided to book using this airline I had never heard of as the timing of their flight to Tahiti worked for us. We had low expectations, realizing we would have to pay for everything from bags to meals. We were so pleasantly surprised. Clean modern plane, good entertainment system, friendly cabin crew, OK meal, and of most surprise - good legroom in economy with a good recline for the seats. The flight was on time. I would therefore recommend this airline - good value for money.

### "really pleased with my experience"
I booked RT San Francisco to Paris before reading reviews and was terrified. However, I was really pleased with my experience. We showed up early as directed and were treated great, especially by the Paris crew. I did the math beforehand and even with fees saved a lot of money going. The meals were good and reasonably priced, same with the a la carte menu.

### "lack of customer service"
This is the worst airline company ever. Unprofessional all the way. They closed our flight check in 1:45mins ahead of departure, and about 10 customers missed their flight although they technically had lots of time to check in. Worse than a lack of customer service.

### "close check in 1h 30m before departure"
I arrived at the airport 1h 30m before my flight to check in. It will not allow you to check in online. So I went towards the security representative who tells me to head to the kiosk to check in and to see him after and that too does not work, I turn around he is gone. I think nothing of it and start heading to the counter & they quickly tell me I cannot check in because I need a stamp on my passport from security? The security guy who instead of stamping me just leaves because apparently they close check in 1h 30m before departure. That makes no sense. They will take your money, close the desk and leave the customer service around to charge you to rebook. Sometimes the allure of a cheap ticket isn’t all that it’s pent up to be.

### "never recommend anyone fly French Bee"
This airline is a scam. While the initial ticket price may lure you in, what you will pay in arbitrary fees, or even if you want a beverage other than water on board, just spend the money and fly an actual airline. The "customer service" agents at Orly are by far the rudest, most unhelpful airline employees I have ever encountered. While trying to speak or ask a question, they rudely turned away while repeating "no" over you while you tried to speak. As part of a group of 10+ passengers which all "missed our flight" due to arriving 90 minutes before the flight (never specified on any French Bee booking information) we were provided with snarky responses from the French Bee customer service team such as "just leave your luggage at the airport .. but that's illegal" or "you all did this to yourselves". They refused to provide written documentation of the rebooking of the flight, or itemized list of fees for rebooking. On board, I have never been more cramped on a flight, the food was awful with only the option of water with meal (even if you paid for a meal). The bathroom sink was clogged about 5 hours into the flight. I would never recommend anyone fly French Bee for any reason. Spend the extra money and fly a reputable airline.

### "recommend and fly with them again"
I feel bad that French Bee has so many negative reviews, so I figured I would leave one to balance out the negative reviews and give a more accurate representation of this airline. I overall thought the airline was great and I would definitely fly again, considering the price. My only two complaints are the seats are so tight, that if my hips were any wider, I wouldn't fit. The seat type I was in wouldn't allow you to lift the arm rest for more room. If you weigh more than like 220 pounds, ouch. The boarding process is also a bit chaotic. I appreciate that they board the plane back to front, but everyone gathers and crowds to get there to hear them call out the rows to board. Then its a mad rush of everyone rushing to get on board. Other than that, I found the flight attendants friendly, the plane is very clean and has a small but decent amount of entertainment options, bathrooms are clean, and for that price I would absolutely fly them again. I feel that the people complaining about not being able to check in an hour and a half early, are most likely those who are arriving last minute, so that's their own fault. International flights tell you three hours early, so to me that doesn't sound like a french bee problem, but a personal problem. So can't ding them there. As my flight wasn't cancelled I can't comment on the refund process. But I wouldn't shy away from booking with them. I was freaking myself out reading the reviews prior to my flight, but my actual experience was much better than I would expect. I would recommend and fly with them again.

### "urging me to book 2 flights"
On September 5th at check-in in Papeete the following situation occurred. An employee for Frenchbee, ended up urging me to book 2 flights out of the US. He insisted we defiance! B1/B2 visa for the USA does not have a connecting flight, he does not check in for the flight PPT-SFO We are not picked up by the airline without a booked onward flight as we only have one flight from PPT to SFO. As the immigration officer in the US later told me. Because the necessary booking could not be processed quickly enough, I had to try to show a second ticket for a connecting flight with an e-ticket number in good time.

### "worst airline I’ve ever flown"
French bee is the worst airline I’ve ever flown with. I was flying on my own, got stuck in traffic and arrived a hour and 25 minuets before. I was checked in online and exhausted. They refused to let me check in my bag claiming their policy to check in bags is a hour and half before. 5 minutes Late I said can you make a exception they said no and even 1 minuet late they don’t allow. No matter what your situation is. They get the worse customer service only 2 staff on site and I figured I can book my flight for that night I have a holiday the next day which I can’t fly on .. i waited for a good while they did not apologize and just said you can fly with no bags - I said so your proposing to leave it at airport ?I got no refund , and had to fly the next day for 1500 -  they don’t care at all about their customers and are really rude.

### "personnel needs training big time"
Low-coster with very poor customer service. Tried to charge us for a stroller, when we boarded and the plane was delayed for an hour, would not let us use the restroom until the aircraft was in the air. The planes are somewhat new but personnel needs training big time

### "Worst airline ever"
Worst airline ever! They had the best time and airport for a direct flight from San Francisco to Paris so I bought a direct flight end of June 2021 for a 9/18/21 departure. On 8/4/21 they canceled the flight. I was still emailing them in September to get my money back! I had to be proactive to do all the research on how to get reimbursed, had to call them then fill a form and email it to them and despite all that it took about 2 months for them to actually refund the cost of the tickets. I always get tempted to buy an SFO to orly French Bee flight since landing in Orly is convenient for where I'm going next, but it's just not worth the risk.

### "never recommend it to anyone"
I've had negative experiences before of course, but never one so appallingly awful that I felt the need to warn others. Their cheap prices lure you in, but it is not worth it. I was flying from Dublin to Los Angeles with a layover in Paris. Upon landing in Paris, I decided to check in online while waiting to pick up my luggage, before making my way over to the other terminal. Their system would not let me check in, as I needed to show proof of my US visa. Not thinking a whole lot of it, I made my way over to the other terminal in what I imagined to be great time. Arriving at the check-in kiosks more than 90 minutes before departure, it would not let me check in there either. Confused, I walked towards the check in counters with clerks, and met two groups of people who where having a back and forth with the clerks about not being able to get on the LA flight, as they were abruptly rolling down the shutters and closing the baggage belts. I was confused. I knew I was there in great time. There was no way I could have missed this flight? Knowing what I was going to hear, I waited my turn and said I was there to check in for the LA flight. I was rudely pointed towards the customer service desk and told that I needed to book another flight. I looked towards the other groups of people and one guy said they were all equally confused. We walked over to the customer service desk together and met around 5/6 other people who had encountered the same situation. As we waited in line for help, more and more people who were supposed to be on the LA flight started to show up. Frustrated but unsurprised, the customer service representatives were incredibly rude, unhelpful and entitled. My options were, pay $400 + for a flight to San Francisco later that day and make my own way to LA from there, or pay $400 for a flight to LA the next day, and book a hotel in Paris for the night. Apparently check in closes exactly 90 minutes before departure. This wasn't made clear to me when booking, and clearly to the 20+ other people who were in the same boat as me. There was no one around and they easily could have checked us in. Aside from this, I was at the check-in desks more than 90 minutes before departure and I had previously tried to check in online! They wouldn't hear any of it. They wouldn't let me talk or explain the situation. The agents were the opposite of calm, and turned to shouting at and fighting with customers instead. I was absolutely flabbergasted. So I ended up sitting outside the airport like a bloody fool while my flight hadn't departed. There is no doubt that we all could have very easily got on that flight. I guess they make their money through having people pay for multiple flights though. There is always a catch with these low cost airlines. One guy had the exact same thing happen to him two days in a row, so he had to book three flights through them just to get back to LA. The lady "helping him" simply mocked him and went off when he mentioned her customer service skills. So all in all, I ended up paying more than double the price of what I originally paid. For this, I could have flown with a reputable airline where I wouldn't have been squashed in a seat like a sardine where you have to pay to get a cup of water. I will never fly French Bee again and I will never recommend it to anyone.

### "fly a different airline"
It’s absolutely worth any difference in fare price to fly a different airline. Today I got an email that my flight was canceled and that the only option was a flight a week later. I’ve tried to call over a dozen times today and been disconnected each time. I gave my direct telephone number to call me back with the agent after being cut off the first two times and never got a call back. They won’t confirm a new flight even on their website unless I buy a new ticket. Just needed up buying a return ticket on another airline. The worst air travel experience ever. Still have not received any response from them.

### "Would definitely fly again"
Not Verified |  Great experience. Check in was fast using face recognition, the flight left on time and the staff were phenomenal. There were no questions about how many bags we had or how large they were. The plane seemed new and the airline seemed like they cared that you had a good experience. Seats reclined back far. Would definitely fly again.

### "a very pleasant experience"
Newark to Paris. I had a very pleasant experience at the airport and while boarding the plane. My expectations were low because of the reviews I saw online. When comparing this airline to others I would say: the seats recline really comfortably and the bathrooms onboard are spacious and clean. Great value, especially being an inexpensive airline.

### "Avoid French Bee at all costs"
Avoid French Bee at all costs! While flying with my wife and two young children from Paris to LAX, we checked in online and got our boarding passes on my phone. The boarding passes explicitly stated that baggage drop closed 1 hour before (the time it stated was 13:50, flight was at 14:50). As such, we arrived 90 minutes early to provide some buffer, but when we arrived at the baggage desk they claimed bag drop was closed and that we were too late. Every agent was incredibly rude, disrespectful, and actively unhelpful. They stated that we needed to go to the ticket counter to rebook our flight, and the ticket agent initially quoted a price of $150 per person to change our flights. However, they said we needed to sit and wait for our original flight to depart (so we officially "miss" it) before they'd rebook us. Then, when we went to rebook, they claimed it was impossible for us to change to any flight within the next 3 days for under $2000. Ultimately, we ended up having to fly into SFO instead and fork over $2,500 for the privilege of flying in 4 hours late to an airport 300+ miles away from home. If they had even told me it'd cost that much initially, I would've just ditched our checked bag instead of allowing them to force us into missing the flight we had boarding passes for! I would never consider flying French Bee again, and I'm aghast that they're still in business with their predatory and dishonest business practices. There were at least another 5-10 people on our flight who had something similar happen, as well. It's a total scam, never ever ever get tempted by their "cheap" prices!

### "They claimed we were late"
Not Verified |  Horrible experience with the airline. We booked this flight for our travel from Paris to LAX and we arrived at the airport 2 hours before departure. Inspire of arriving that early, they didn’t let us checkin. They claimed we were late. The staff were very rude and very unhelpful. When we tried to reschedule our flight at the counter, the guy was more angry than me and was more rude. I didn’t understand why he was angry considering I should’ve been more angry. We had to pay a penalty of 150 euros plus the fare difference if we chose to reschedule. They don’t refund the money if you want to cancel. I know they offer less fare prices and it’s very tempting to book with the airlines but please don’t do so. It’s not worth it. We paid 2000 dollars and booked a different flight and we lost the money that we used to book with French bee airlines. Oh and another thing is you have pay extra money for the meals if you have any preferences like vegetarian or vegan or so.

### "experience in this company is horrible"
Not Verified |  I took French Bee to fly from the Paris Orly to Newark on the 14th August, I could not print my boarding pass in the machines and one representative told me it is your fault.I was early to the Aéroport and because of their unprofessionalism, I was about to lose my flight. They told me your are ineligible (I am a green card holder), once I have got to the boarding gate, they told me we have a TSA and you have to check again, I have been going through agents who asked me very intrusive and nonsensical questions, I was pulled apart to do this humiliating checking, I have asked them for the reasons why they do this, they told me it is random and I think that it is far to be random. My experience in this company is horrible, I would never recommend anyone to travel with French Bee.

### "I don't recommend them"
Not Verified |  It was a bad experience. The staff at the front desk where rude and condescending. They keep saying they did not represent French Bee after I was referred to them by the staff helping customers by the kiosks machines. Their English is very poor and i was not able to get the appropriate assistance. They kept asking me to come back later and made me miss my plane to charge me more. Their attitude is unprofessional and unacceptable. After the whole ordeal I wrote to French Bee for compensation of my time and I got no help, even after i provided proof that other passengers had problems with the kiosks. I rather pay more and fly with another airline than go back to them. I don't recommend them.

### "Never, ever fly French Bee"
This airline is a scam. Because of a last-minute family emergency, I booked a flight through edreams from Nice to LAX. It had a two hour layover. I checked in online the night before, but the French Bee's website wouldn't allow me to print a ticket. I figured two hours would be plenty of time. My flight landed on time, and my French Bee flight was supposed to leave at 15.20. When I arrived at Orly, I was informed by the gate agents that they: 1) Had moved up the flight 30 minutes early, 2) Therefore, I could not print my boarding pass or check my bag (even though I was there an hour and a half before the scheduled departure), 3) I would have to purchase a new ticket. The gate agents were also the rudest I ever encountered - I was begging them to be let on the flight, as I could have made it, and they laughed and wouldn't help me. They directed me to an hour long line full of 30 other passengers who also weren't allowed to board their flight. As I had an emergency, I ended up booking another flight from Air France and lost about 3,000 euro. When I contacted customer service, they condescendingly told me that "this is how the airline industry works. I fly around 20-30 times a year - most other airlines close check in 30-45 minutes before boarding, and will at least try to get you on your flight. French Bee appears to actively encourage customers to miss their flight, so they can double-charge them on a second ticket. This is not how the airline industry works, these are unethical business practices. And the other reviews & passengers who missed their flights indicate that the problem is French Bee, not us. I am desperately trying to get a refund, but French Bee has refused me. My travel insurance won't cover it because I was technically checked in. There is no help, just a lesson for you: Never, ever fly French Bee. The low fares are a scam.

### "worst airline I have ever flown"
My experience was terrible with this airline. I was informed at check-in that my AstraZeneca vaccination was not accepted in France. So I was obliged to run about to get the expensive test done before the flight. I was also informed that an exit ticket from France (within 90 days) was required. I had pre-paid 55$ for a gourmet dinner but was served the ordinary (awful) meal instead. This was the worst airline I have ever flown.

### "rude representative"
Newark to Paris. My elderly parents missed their flight. There was a diabetes scare (my mother is diabetic) and we arrived minutes after they closed their check-in. Their offices were closed so we had to purchase new tickets for the next day (btw: French Bee charges for luggage and they are not listed on the terminal signs at EWR). When I called in at the next available opportunity to kindly ask to pay the difference in the tickets (my tickets were insured, but that's not the point), the rude representative told me it was not a French Bee problem - elderly parents were listed as No Shows so too bad and have a nice day. PS French Bee may wish to list their name on the Terminal sign at EWR. Which they do not do. Feel free to reach out, French Bee. I will await your response.

### "Pre-paid services were not delivered!"
Warning: Pre-paid services (ie: meals and priority boarding) were not delivered! My family and I did not receive our pre-paid meals. If you pre-pay for priority boarding good luck trying to exercise this additional service. There is no crowd control at the gate and the airline staff does not provide a mechanism to ensure priority boarding is honored. Airport experience at Orly Paris, French Bee is total mayhem with no clear lines.

### "they refuse to discuss the matter with me"
French Bee lost my bag and is now refusing to refund me for the expenses I incurred while the bag was lost, despite saying they would do so. Let me explain: 1) French Bee stewardess took my carry on bag out of the overhead compartment without telling me or giving me a baggage claim ticket, and then left it at my departure airport. French Bee customer service admitted this was unacceptable and not part of their normal procedures. 2) It took 4 days for me to get my bag back. 3) I was told by French Bee staff to save and submit my expense receipts so that I could be reimbursed for clothes and toiletries I had to buy while waiting for my bag. 4) When I submitted these receipts French Bee staff tells me via email they will only honor 50% of my expenses without any explanation why. I was never informed only 50% of my expenses would be covered prior to incurring my expenses. 5) When I call French Bee customer service line, they refuse to discuss the matter with me, telling me they don’t handle customer service complaints like this over the phone and I can only handle it via email. When I ask to speak with a manager/supervisor they hang up the phone one me. 6) I’m a college student in over $100,000 USD of debt and because of French Bee airline’s mistake I am out a few hundred euros for expenses incurred while waiting for my bag to arrive. I don’t understand why the French Bee team is treating me so disrespectfully and not offering to pay 100% of the expenses I incurred due to the complete fault of their airline.

### "worst flying experience"
Not Verified | Paris to New York. This has been the worst flying experience I have ever had. Me along with 3 other flyers were denied access to the aircraft. Gate agents ripped up our boarding passes and told us we weren’t flying back home. When we asked if we would at least receive a refund or another flight out his response was we would get a free flight out the next day. This was a complete lie when we went back to the check in desk we were told the next flight out was 3 days away and we had to pay another $350 and didn’t receive a refund from the priori ticket cost. I strongly encourage people to pick a different airline even if it costs more over dealing with this company. I will never be flying with this airline again

### "staff were not helpful"
French Bee flight staff were not helpful and interrupted an overnight flight with announcements multiple times an hour and kept bright cabin lights on. They boarded and took off an hour late even though no delay was announced. There was no organization to boarding. Flying from Paris to EWR, French Bee didn't give the option to do mobile check in, and the kiosks wouldn't allow check in even though it was more than 90 min before boarding. The check in desks closed and the staff were unwilling to help. The woman explaining to me was smirking at me the entire time like it was funny. I went to the desk to transfer to another flight and they were going to charge a ticket difference of €360 per person. I went online to see the tickets for the next day, and they were €360. My original tickets were that much. The people at the transfer desk were rude and unwilling to actually help. One lady was speaking English to a customer solely, then said "I don't speak English". Management there is horrible.

### "Horrible ground crew"
Newark to Paris. Horrible ground crew, absolutely rude and disorganized - after waiting in line to board, I was told that "I needed to use my eyes and see that the gate for premium is different, so now "Because you don't look". I need to stand in another line again". The boarding pass clearly reflected we stood in the correct line, by the way. Then 2 hours before landing, the pilot put on the seatbelt sign for minimal turbulence that passed about 2 min after it started. My son needed to use the toilet, so after about 30 min I asked the flight attendant, who just waved her finger - "NO NO NO". Then, again, half an hour later, same thing. We finally landed, but we couldn't get to the gate because it was occupied. 30 additional minutes. My son finally, crying, went in the barf bag after peeing on himself. He's 10 and never had an accident. I can handle the lack of management that allowed this to happen, but the absolute rudeness of their employees is something no one should have to deal with.

### "not recognize the Paris pharmacy antigen test"
Not Verified |  French Bee staff started boarding early and closed boarding early at 2 hours before not the 1.5hr as stated. Would not recognize the Paris pharmacy antigen test we obtained said they would hold our spot in line and to get an additional test at clinic downstairs. Back in twenty minutes with negative tests and they wouldn't acknowledge us in line said the boarding is closed. Had to fly the next day and tried to charge us again for baggage which was already extremely high priced, got seats further back and the extra money we had paid for more leg room and Wine & cheese ignored. Sent four emails no response. called the office said they don't deal with complaints to email customer service! Beware, do not patronize this low budget airline, deceptive practices, rude attendants.

### "I really enjoyed this flight"
I really enjoyed this flight. So surprised as other reviewers were harsh. We did purchase the extended leg room. It was so worth it. My husband is 6’4”. The staff was very nice and attentive. Seating was as nice as Americans First Class although it was tight when seat in front reclined fully It was a great way to start our vacation.

### "can't explain why they are asking for more money"
Took my money. Said flight was changeable for no fee. Charged fee to change. Do not fly. If you want to throw money away, a recycling bin is easier. Customer service says they can't explain why they are asking for more money, but if you want to fly you need to pay more. Dropped calls, broken website.

### "arrived too late to check in"
Horrible experience. I arrived too late to check in, meaning I lost my flight. Six other passengers and I had to wait in line and deal with extremely rude customer service employees. They gave us two options: fly to San Francisco in two days for 200 euros or fly to New York tomorrow for 500 euros. I watched as people paid the 500 euros each to get on the next flight. The customer service people had no sympathy for us.

### "Worst service ever!"
We were at the airport 2 hours in advance, well on time. While queuing at the check-in desk, a lady suddenly came running up and announced through the microphone that it was the 'last call' to check in. Literally 1 minute later, while her colleagues were still checking in, she closed all counters and shouted to us and some other travelers who were queuing that we had missed our flight and had to come back the next day. Even though we were there in time, even before her call. She wouldn't listen. One minute later, all of the French Bee staff walked away without saying a word. All of their customers still standing there were left alone, had to book a new flight and had to pay extra via the Help Desk. Never experienced. Worst service ever! They'll never see us back.

### "never experienced such a lack of customer service"
I flew to Paris from San Francisco on December 11, 2021 and had booked a return flight from Paris back to San Francisco on December 17, 2021. I arrived at ORY with plenty of time before the flight took off, but was denied boarding, along with many other passengers. We had received no notification that we needed to arrive at the airport excessively early for this flight, and multiple flight attendants were still around. We were repeatedly told we would be allowed to board if we checked our luggage into a different area, and we kept being transferred to different parts of the airport and being told different information. We were all incredibly upset that we were continuously being lied to, just so that airport staff wouldn't have to deal with our issue. This was my first visit to Paris, and I was fortunate to experience kindness from people in the city, but I was shocked at the rudeness of airport staff during this occurrence. At the help desk, I was told I could be switched to the New York flight for €100, but very shortly after, I was told it was too late, even though that flight would not be leaving for much longer, and I had been patiently waiting at the desk the entire time for service. Multiple other passengers who were supposed to be on the New York flight joined us shortly after, after having been denied boarding, as well. I have never experienced such a lack of customer service, and I am attempting to seek a refund for my troubles. I had to book an entirely separate through TAP Air Portugal to return to the US, which cost more than my entire original round trip through French Bee.

### "denied entry for being too late"
I didn't even catch the flight. I was denied entry for being "too late," even though I had plenty of time to board. The staff at the counter said I should have been there four hours earlier. Their correspondences indicated no such thing. I have never missed a flight in my life, but I wasn't alone. In the five minutes I stood in line at the help desk, I met almost a dozen other people with the same issue. I'm writing this from an airport lobby, resting my head on my book bag, preparing to sleep here for the night. Never,  ever fly this airline.

### "the service on board was great"
I was pleasantly surprised by my trip with French Bee. I was on a different airline arriving to Newark but my flight got delayed. French Bee customer service answered the line within just a few minutes and were willing to rebook me without a fee; only had to pay the difference if needed. I was able to make it to the desk just a few minutes before closing and the staff were very professional and friendly. Finally, the flight was good and the service on board was great. For the cost and after this experience, I will definitely fly with them again.

### "very bad flight experience"
Terrible crew, terrible food and very bad flight experience. Avoid at all cost. Cheap ticket is one thing, being taken for a fool as a customer is not acceptable.

### "told the test would be free"
Not Verified |  The staff had no idea that presenting a Covid recovery letter with a positive test would exempt us from having to take a Covid test before returning to the US. They delayed us until 20 minutes before luggage check in was closed, and forced us to take a test anyway because we did not have a QR code to scan. I was told the test would be free - it was not. When I presented a receipt to them 2 minutes before check in closed, they asked "why would it be free?". Initially rude, they wasted my time and money and acted like I was in the wrong for being visibly frustrated.

### "I couldn't have asked for more!"
Based on all the reviews, I was prepared for the worst. Being a regular Spirit customer, my bar for airlines is extremely low. But, they had real seat-back pockets, their seats reclined and were actually very comfortable, they had free movies, nice attendants, a free (mediocre) meal, clean bathrooms. I couldn't have asked for more! Got me from A to B without making me feel like cattle.

### "It’s impressively awful"
Not Verified |  Never understood how bad low cost airlines can be until I flew with French bee. It’s impressively awful. None of my other experiences have nearly been as bad. The staff were pretty bad. Like I wave my arms and scream to get their attention and they somehow miss me from 2 feet away. I asked for water when they were walking around with the beverages but they walked right by me all 3 times out of 3. They push the cart right through at least 10 rows of seats. Once they were walking by with the beverage cart and went through 20 rows of seats until they decided to randomly stop. I assumed they’d return but they did not. The luggage was delayed by 2 hours. The check in process was a nightmare. Especially when I’m on vacation, I try to be understanding but some aspects were just avoidable. Delays happen, that’s ok, but some issues were just, unnecessary, unprofessional and below the lowest standards.

### "You get what you pay for"
Not Verified |  Cancelled my flight, automatically put me on another flight 1 day later, very difficult to reach customer service to understand why and how to change the flight / get my money back. You get what you pay for. Very unreliable, cheap, poor quality service. Might be worth it if you're on a strict budget and have very flexible dates, but even then I'm not sure it's worth the hassle.

### "low quality service"
San Francisco to Paris. Low price and low quality service. I pay for food in the flight and for nice seats but they dont find on the system, so I don’t have food in a almost 12 hours flight. Thanks for the experience French Bee.

### "a mistake at Edreams"
I booked a flight from Papeete to Paris via San Francisco on Edreams. They proceeded to the reservation on French Bee. When I arrived at Papeete airport, I was asked to collect my luggage in San Francisco. This was something I could not do, as there was only two hours of transit time. I tried everything,  I stressed all the people in the customs line to try to arrive on time, finally I missed the flight to Paris. In San Francisco put me back on the next flight to Paris (2 days later). I asked them to book me a hotel which was refused because for them it was a mistake at Edreams. They left me without a solution. I had some money and I was able to book a hotel (end of holidays=limited budget). When I came back, I tried everything to recover the hotel and restaurant expenses.

### "everything was exceptional"
Paris to San Francisco. After reading negative reviews after I had already booked my ticket, I was bracing for the worst, but to my surprise, everything was exceptional and trouble free. Check in and boarding was fast and efficient. The plane was brand new. The food was good, there was even a baguette instead of the usual roll. I was seated in the last row but the seat reclined all the way, first time I’ve ever seen that. The inflight entertainment was similar to other long haul flights, a selection of new releases along with some older movies. I’m not a tall person but there seemed to be a lot of legroom, more than discount carriers for sure, it seemed the same amount of space as a major carrier. I was surprised to read that others said the seats were tight, it all seemed fairly roomy. Maybe my plane was different? Anyway, I’d totally fly French Bee again, such a good value! I’ve been on over 50 flights the last five years, and I would say this was in the top 5 for sure.

### "staff is super nice"
San Francisco to Papeete. I've flown on French Bee 10 times now and it was always perfect. Aircraft is brand new, seats go very far back, staff is super nice. Movie selection is awesome. Check in in Tahiti was very long.

### "misleading commercial practices"
Paris to San Francisco. French Bee is the worst. I have nothing to say about their cabin staff services, they are very professional and it is like any other Economy Class type of flight: long and tiring for everyone. My only problem with FrenchBee is with their customer service: I suggest you never have to make a modification on your flight: FrenchBee will take your money and send you a confirmation, then later cancel your confirmation and tell you that you have to pay for another flight (if you're lucky to see that they canceled your reservation.) I do not recommend you to fly with them, their unfair and misleading commercial practices is something that should not be allowed anywhere in the world.

### "Very nice crew"
San Francisco to Paris. Got to the Airport 3 hours early and when the counter opened I checked my bag and even though a little over on weight said it was not a problem. The seating was tight but not nasty small. ( I'm 5'11" and weigh 210lbs). Plane was new and clean with no nasty odors. All seats had a small blue blanket in plastic packaging. the inflight entertainment was good with menu choices from using your laptop/phone to output video on your screen to cameras on the nose and tail to see where you are going, to a choice of about 30 movies plus a few TV programs. Still not too shabby for the $180.00 seat price. You also can order duty free stuff and also munchies from the video screen menu - chips are 2 EU, and you can buy 2 small bottles of jack Daniels and 2 chips for 10.00 but no different from other airlines these days! The flight was good and bathrooms were clean. The Cabin crew spoke mostly French but were fine.. by the end of 11 hours the seats were feeling a little bit hard. Just keep in mind that I think most folks miss, especially those who have flown to Europe before, this is not a $2000 flight. It's basically a nice clean seat on a bus. Bring snacks or a sandwich with you along with a neck pillow. I even had the chance to talk to the flight crew including the pilot who was from Madrid. Very nice crew.

### "terrible customer support"
San Francisco to Papeete. Our flight was delayed because the pilot was sick. The plane left the next morning so we missed our connections which resulted in needing a hotel in San Francisco and Tahiti. French Bee's customer service to handle this delay was a disaster. No help with anything (hotels, meals). They said to fill out an online form for reimbursement of costs after returning home. I spent hours trying to submit an online form. Finally only worked using Chrome browser after many attempts. After over a month finally received an email requesting receipts which I emailed. Received an email requesting bank information (including SWIFT number) so they could transfer them money (They can't send a check). It has been over 6 months and I still don't have the reimbursement after many emails asking why they haven't sent me the money. Same problem for everyone that joined me on this trip. I suggest never using French Bee since they have no backup pilots along with terrible customer support. Use United Airlines if flying from San Francisco to Tahiti.

### "Treated horribly"
Paris to San Francisco. Worst airlines ever. They asked to board 2 hours early and instead of boarding they made us wait at the entrance of aircraft for 1 hour. No special entrance for infants. Not allowed to feed the baby not step out at the boarding gate. The baby was crying continuously but no kind-hearted person. One of the passenger names was reversed from original and was stuck issuing a boarding pass for hours. When I read online it did happen for many other customers. They charged €150 and finally allowed to board. Treated horribly. Would never travel through them again in my life. Tickets are neither cheap we just need to buy each item separately. Unfortunately, there were no other flights for the required days else would have booked some other airlines even though I already paid them money. Felt really bad seeing my 3 months crying for milk and they not allowed to feed or board the flight.

### "I wish I had been better prepared"
Not Verified |  San Francisco to Paris Orly. This was my first experience flying a low cost carrier internationally and I wish I had been better prepared. The flight to Orly was fine except the seats were extremely uncomfortable - they are molded resin and my body did not match the mold they used! The food was almost inedible and you have to pay for wine! The return trip was a nightmare - somehow they had reversed the names of my granddaughter and the check in person refused to issue a boarding pass! From then on the nightmare got worse as I was referred from counter to counter - after two hours of this they finally issued a boarding pass with the original name reversal!The Orly French Bee staff were poorly trained or nor trained at all and the counters were dramatically understaffed. If you are going to fly French Bee, take your own food,make sure you have pillows etc. as these are not provided and accept there are no freebies at all!

### "to fix the error was $200"
San Francisco to Paris Orly. Due to having to make a last minute trip, I decided to try French Bee for my first time. I went through the registration on the site and accidentally put my last name as first name and vice-versa as they requested last name first (European style). When I received my confirmation letter, which I carefully checked, it showed my name "correct" though as they used a European style they actually showed last name, first name. Thinking all was good (i.e. no change fee in the first 24 hrs) I only discovered the error when I was checking in and found out to fix the error it was $200 (half the cost of the ticket). I wrote a letter to their customer service explaining that their confirmation did not indicate first name last name and thus I couldn't detect it was wrong. They denied my request and basically explained it was my fault and didn't acknowledge their error in creating a confirmation that considers that the sequence of first name, last name can vary by country. On top of that it took an hour for the bags to arrive in the bag pickup area because the plane was late.

### "it's good value for money"
I don't understand why everyone hates on this airline. I flew from Paris to San Francisco and back in May 2019. The plane was new, enough space, great service, perfect entertainment program, relaxed bag rules (if you read the booking rules carefully and purchase the extras), courteous stewards, safe feeling inside, good food, unlimited supply of water, clean, punctual. The only problem is the booking process, which is a bit counter-intuitive, but this has nothing to do with the flight itself. I'd really recommend French Bee. The prices are super cheap also, so it's good value for money.

### "my tickets were never issued"
I planed for my family vacation in Paris and booked tickets through their website in January. After booking and paid with my CC, I received the confirmation # and E-Ticket #. I paid in full When I saw the correct amount was charged in my CC statement. In April when I went to the SFO airport for check-in, CSR at the ticket counter said my tickets were never issued. The CSR went inside the office and talked to her boss in France and said that only way she could get us on board is to pay the full price at the gate. I showed my E-ticket/confirmation number and credit card statement to her but no use. CSR said she believed me and my documents, but there is nothing she could do but charging again. I argued until 15 minutes before the boarding time, but I really had to pay not to ruin our vacation. I even visited French bee office in France, but the response was the same - There was nothing they could do but claim through their website. After coming back from France, I filed the complaint through their website and called 800 number, but I have not heard from them for 2 weeks. Luckily there were available seats, and we were managed to make our trip (although x2 the ticket price), but we were not be able to fly if it was a fully booked flight.

### "Worst company ever experienced"
Not Verified |  Paris to Saint Denis Reunion. Paid for seats with extra space but got refused when check in in because we don't speak French well enough. When filing a complaint and asking for money thay agreed ans they would refund the extra money we paid. This was promised more then 8 months ago and we still did not receive. (Reminder from our side on a monthly base). Worst company ever experienced

### "never had a worse experience"
San . Francisco to TahitiUnbelievable. Showed up to the airport and after waiting in a long line they informed me on of the pilots was “sick” and they were cancelling the flight. The told us they would call us and give us details about a new flight, i had to drive back to the airport several hours later to try and find out some information. They scheduled the flight for 9am, but then at 8:55 they pushed the departure back another hour. As a result I will lose 2 days of my vacation. We landed after the last ferry I needed to take to another island, so I had to stay in a horrible hotel and wait. I have never had a worse experience with this airline. I should have listened to the other reviews detailing similar cancelled flights. No food, jammed airline, barely any water. I cannot express how disappointed I am with this airline.

### "pretty good for the money"
San Francisco to Paris Orly. Overall pretty good for the money, unless you're in a hurry or have connections. We left 2 hours late from SFO because we were waiting for the passengers from Tahiti to pass customs, check their luggage again etc, etc. I think this is pretty common on this route because it's really a Tahiti-Orly route with a stop in SFO. Being right before the holidays (dec. 15th), the flight was pretty full with families. I had purchased a premium package to be able to choose my seat and have a meal. The meal was pretty good, but for the breakfast you'll have to pay extra. On the way back, our plane boarded two hours late no explained reasons. Staff was very nice and pleasant and flight fast and comfy.

### "prevented me to board"
Paris to San Francisco. Customer service is non existant, they send you from one counter to the other hoping you’ll disappear! I had a reservation on a flight back to San Francisco from Paris and they prevented me to board the flight claiming I refused to pay the penalty fee. I gave the agent my CC on the phone a week prior of flying and if problem there was, they had my cell and was reachable in Paris at all time. I missed X-mas back home and now stuck in France waiting for the next flight, they are asking me close to a full fare to board a last minute flight.

### "never fly this airline"
Paris to San Francisco. I purchased a ticket using someone else’s card, which the site allowed me to do 2-3 weeks before my flight. I was never notified that I needed to update my payment information and upon arriving at the airport I was told my ticket was suspended. I was not notified of this and as a result I missed my flight, the next flight was in 3 days so I had to book a flight for over $900 to make it home, an Uber ride to the other airport in Paris and a hotel in Ireland for an overnight layover. The customer service department is horrible and the service at their information booth at ORLY was horrible too. They had no sense of urgency when I told them about my problem and did nothing to assist me. One of the ladies would not help be because she said I spoke English too fast and that she did not speak English. She asked me in return if a very sarcastic and demeaning way “ do you speak French?” Does it sound like I speak French. Please never fly this airline.

### "was the worst experience"
San Francisco to Paris. On May 21st 2018, My fiancee and I flew with French Bee to Paris. Our first bad experience was the inability to add checked bags on their website. We spoke to their customer service line and were told that they couldn't add it on for us and that we should use the website 24 hours prior to boarding our flight. When we tried to do this, we were met with the same message that said we could not add checked bags on the website. When we got to the terminal to get our boarding passes and add our bags through them, they charged us $95 per bag. Once we got to our gate, we waited far longer than the time that stated when we would take off, which was 8:30 p.m. We did not take off until 11:45 p.m. and were told that it was due to an immigration issue involving other passengers. There was no technical difficulty nor was there any inclement weather preventing an on time take off. According to regulation (EC) 261/2004, any delay over 3 hours at a distance over 3500 km would entitle us to compensation of 300 euro. Two days after we'd arrived in Paris, we received a call saying that our flight back home was rescheduled from the original date of June 6th 2018 to June 8th and that we needed to confirm that we would take that flight or opt for returning 7 days early or 7 days later. Either option would cost hundreds as last minute hotel reservations in paris were not cheap. From May 23rd until June 7th, I was repeatedly calling the customer service line and getting answers like "we can't help with compensation", "We need to speak with our superiors and call you back" (Which they never attempted to call back). We went back and fourth with no answer as to what we would receive in terms of compensation for our two extra days of stay as well as our extreme delay. Finally, I suggested asking their superiors about the possibility of refunding the full value of our ticket and canceling our return flight and I could purchase another ticket through a different airline. I was explicitly clear with them, even asking them to put into their notes and repeat back what they had written, to call me back in order to confirm that this is still something we wanted to do. After receiving no word for 3 days, I called them back and learned that they had canceled our flight without any confirmation from me. I attempted to have them rebook my fiancee and I on the June 8th flight, only to be met with "I'm sorry but we can't rebook your flight". Again, we had to repeatedly call multiple times a day, every day in order to get a straight answer as to what our options were. Finally, on June 7th, we were told that it would be impossible to rebook and that we would need to purchase another ticket back to the United States, even though we had not (AND STILL HAVEN'T) received the refund they told us was released to us for the original ticket that they had mistakenly canceled. Since returning, I had been trying to claim the compensation that had supposedly been approved. However, without a valid booking reference, the sight would not allow me to do so. This was the worst experience we ever had with a company. The representatives did not care to help, were not competent in their own jobs, were blatantly lying to us and doing everything possible to refuse the help we were asking for. I would never fly with them again nor would I ever recommend this terrible airline to anyone. I only give them one star because that is the only option I have.
