### Phuket Air customer review
I'm travelling to Thailand in 2006. The travel group agent that I use bases their Thailand fares on Phuket Air - but no longer sell those flights as Phuket Air are barred from Europe. The agents comment "Even if Phuket Air get their landing rights back in Europe we wouldn't touch them with a bargepole". I think that qualifies as a negative commen. Happily I am booked on Thai with whom I have had a couple of very good flights in the past. The only downside is that I have to go from Heathrow. What foreign visitors must think of the UK when they arrive at LHR Terminal 3 is beyond me.

Thank you for this excellent opportunity to add our voices to those who have had the dubious pleasure of travelling with Phuket Air. Our holiday was booked through Saga and although our flight out to Bangkok on 2 April was uneventful after reading in the Bangkok press about the catalogue of problems occurring whilst we were on holiday we refused to travel back to the UK on 13th April with Phuket Air. As it happened this coincided with the Thai Ministry of Transport grounding the entire fleet (11 of the 13 had already been suspended pending inspections). Saga found us seats on Austrian Airlines and Saga now want an extra Â£285 each for this - but that's another story! The Daily Telegraph has reported that Phuket Air's flying permit is suspended for the summer by the Department of Transport following "a number of serious safety breaches". The airline's landing rights have also been suspended at Amsterdam Schiphol.

My family and I were due to travel with Phuket airlines in July this year Gatwick - Bangkok. In January I started to get concerned with the number of cancellations and late flights. I then discovered the Skytrax site and am extremely grateful to all of you who have posted comments. In January I re booked with Thai Airlines with whom we have previously travelled it appears to be an extra expense well worth making.

### Phuket Air customer review
We flew with Phuket Air in January but have only just found this site. We must agree with all comments made about this airline. Our outward flight scheduled for 2.00 pm on 18 January was delayed until 7.00 am on 19 January. The aircraft was very cold for the whole journey lots of people sitting with blankets around them. The cabin crew were trying to keep the toilets clean but were not very effective. The in flight service was not of a good standard and we were left for many hours with no food at all. On asking about this we were given a tuna roll. Our return journey which should have left of 29 January at 11.50 pm was delayed until 12.45 pm on the following day. Before we left Sharjah after refuelling the engines on the right hand side of the aircraft were under observation on take off and periodically throughout the rest of the journey. We found this rather worrying more so now after the events of the last few weeks. Our travel insurance company rejected our claim for the return delay because the wording of the airline's letter stated the reason for the delay was 'aircraft rotation' and this is not covered under our policy. We arrived back at Gatwick at 8.30 pm on Sunday and were unable to use our return rail ticket and our son had to make a 400 mile round trip to collect us. We were left considerably out of pocket. We feel that the comments in the press from the airline representative over the fuel spillage incident last week patronising and indifferent to the very real fears of the passengers concerned. Phuket Air pulling out of Great Britain is the best news for travellers to Thailand. The flight problems left us with bad memories of an otherwise very enjoyable holiday.

Arrived back from Bangkok Wednesday 13th April. Started out Saturday 9th April. Flight cancelled no explanation given. Put on a bus for a hotel sat there for over two hours outside the airport. After several trips to the airport and lots of lies later we were finally told we would be taken home by Lufthansa. Great. Not so we taken to the airport again at 21.30 to check in. Lufthansa had no knowledge of us. We were then herded to check in with Phuket Air for a flight at 03.00. After several more cancellations we finally took off at 5am. The flight was uneventful thankfully. No representative from Phuket Air gave any information at any time. All the news we had of the airline being grounded was from the newspapers or family back in the UK. The staff should be given a lesson in telling the truth all we got was lies and more lies. Never again will I fly PHUKET AIR. I think 79 hours for Bangkok to Gatwick is a little too long!

I have just come back from Bangkok via Sharjah taking off April 13th - 5am Thailand time and landing 2.15pm UK time. We were supposed to take off at midnight on April 11th got to check in desk where they were checking people in and then suddenly they stopped and we were informed the flight was delayed 24 hours till the same time the next day. We were put up in the airport hotel (no complaints about that the manager was brilliant) and given vouchers for food but not for drinks not even for water. There was no Phuket Air rep around at all and rumours were spreading that they were about to go bankrupt. We had no info the next day and still no rep but were told by the hotel manager although it was not his responsibility he would try to find out what was happening and post it up on a notice board. We were told we would be updated at 1.30pm. By 5pm there was still no news some people had been stranded for 4 days at the hotel. We were told the flight could possibly go that night or maybe not for days as the airline could go bankrupt. We were eventually told the flight would be going at 3am and to check out at 8.30pm (71/2 hour check in which meant hours waiting at the airport unecessarily!). However the flight didnt leave until 5am eventually. During this time there was no airline rep present at at the airport at all to keep us informed so rumour was rife. When we landed at Sharjah we were not allowed off the plane while refuelling (is this normal practice) and delayed yet another hour for more maintenance. I would never ever fly with them again after this especially hearing about their appalling safety record and other peoples experience.

### Phuket Air customer review
Phuket Air on the 25th March 2005 to a lovely holiday in Thailand. What turned out to be a nightmare was the return flight from Bangkok to Gatwick on the 9th April 2005. On arrival at Bangkok airport on the 26th March 2005 we were handed a sheet of paper and told to ring the number given 72hours before the flight was due to take off to reconfirm the flight and times. We took the flight tickets to an agent and ask if he would do the necessary for which he did it cost 200 baht to get this done we were told that all was in order and was even given a reference number which turned out to be totally ficticous. On arrival at Bangkok airport everything was total chaos as the flight had been cancelled but there was no one from Phuket Air to give any information out to us we were left to roam the airport ourselves to see if we could find anyone that knew anything about the cancelled flight. After several hours we were told that there was a bus waiting outside to take us to a hotel but once outside more chaos as we got on the bus with our luggage we were told that we would have to wait until the bus was full then it could leave. We waited and waited and waited two hours we sat on that bus even the police moved it on as it was there too long. We finally set off only to go round the ring road back to the airport. Still not a word from anyone at Phuket Air. Trying to phone Phuket Air but no answer or engaged. Trying to get home from Bangkok airport flying Phuket air since 9th April 2005 finally got home 14th April 2005. Anyone thinking of flying Phuket air should think again and go by a decent airline as Phuket air doesn't seem to care about it passengers just the money it can get from them.

### Phuket Air customer review
We were booked on a flight with Phuket Airways to fly out on the 26th March with family about a month before we were due to fly we found this web site regarding the disasters that had already happened we have visited Thailand several times and are not nervous passengers but upon reading the reports we tried to change airlines through our booking agent but were unable to because our original tickets were not transferable so we flew to Bangkok as planned once we were on the plane we noticed that the overhead panneling was hanging down once we had taken off the passenger sitting underneath this was getting wet due to condensation they advised the cabin crew of the problem who got another member of staff who then proceeded to stuff the gap with paper and tried to seal the panel with some form of masking tape which did not work my overhead light did not work there was a blocked toilet where someone had put a disposable nappy down so eventually this toilet was taped off and out of use the passenger behind seat would not go into the upright position but because the plane was only half full he could sit in the seat next to him we eventually arrived in Bangkok without any further incidences but not looking forward to our return flight we were on holiday for three weeks but some of the family were to return on the 8th April. We proceeded our holiday and spent the last week in Hong Kong and were to return to Bangkok on the 13th April for 3 days before flying back to the U.K. with Phuket Airways once we had boarded the plane at Hong Kong (Thai Airways) we picked up a complimentary newspaper (Bangkok Post) only to see the headlines "PHUKET AIR WOES LEAVE 800 FUMING" after reading that the aircraft had not passed the safety inspections and the problems with the fuel and hydraulic systems and all but 2 planes were grounded made us very wary about flying home to the UK with them we made the decision that once we had landed at Bangkok we would try to find an alternative airline to fly home with at our own exspense we eventually succeeded to find 2 seats with Eva Air 2 days earlier than planned but for peace of mind we were prepared to pay for the airline tickets. Although we had arranged our flights with another airline we were interested to see if Phuket Airlines were still going to fly to Gatwick on the date we were due to fly with them once we were at Bangkok Airport we located Phuket Offices but they were closed our flight was the following day so when we arrived at the airport the next day we approached Phuket Offices and after waiting several minutes a member of staff appeared and we asked when was the next flight to Gatwick only to be told they didn't know switched off the lights and locked the office. We proceeded with our flight home safely with Eva Air only to speak to our family that had flown home with Phuket Air on the 8th April to hear that there had been uproar with a fellow passenger who insisted that they were assured that the aeroplane that were travelling back on was not the one that had had hydraulic problems previously he was assured by the captain that this was not the same plane but once on board the story changed and it was the same plane so all in all what a sham airline and the moral of the story is never to fly or recommend Phuket Airlines although we would not be surprised to hear that they had gone bankrupt.

I work on a consumer programme for ITV and would be interested in hearing from anyone who was on the Phuket Air flight which had a reported fuel leak during a routine stop at Sharjah on Sunday 3rd April 2005. We would be interested in hearing your story. Please send your contact details using the Comment Form at the bottom of this page and Skytrax will put you in touch with Sarah.

### Phuket Air customer review
I agree with other comments from fellow passengers on flight 618 on April 2nd. It was a complete nightmare and an exhausting experience for all involved. The lack of communication the standard of accommodation at Sharjah and the lack of food and water for hundreds of stranded and delayed passengers left a lot to be desired. Horrified to read their UK sales manager's Gordon MacFarland's quotes to the press. Come on Phuket Air take responsibility especially in light of further problems with your aircraft and apologise please.

### Phuket Air customer review
A word of advice - do not under any circumstances fly with Phuket Air! If you are due to fly with this company to London Gatwick in the next few days I would strongly advise trying to change airline companies. We just landed after a hysterical journey from hell - which began in Bangkok on Saturday night and ended in London (via Sharjah and Amsterdam) on Monday afternoon.

### Phuket Air customer review
I was also on the same nightmare flight and got stranded in Sharjah. If Phuket air did not think they done anything wrong or that there were no problems with the planes they should have been available and around the hotels talking to us. We are still waiting for an apology.

### Phuket Air customer review
I was on the same 72 hour nightmare from hell trip as the others but it is not a one-off. On our flight out we ended up taking 10 hours to get from Bangkok to Phuket but not before our first plane had set off only to return 20 minutes into the flight due to "technical problems" with no explanation ever offered to us except being offered 200 baht to spend in the restaurant. This experience paled however next to the return flight. Despite the British Embassy getting involved the Sharjah branch switched off their phones and fled their offices the Bangkok office would not answer their phones and no member of the crew were prepared to speak to the passengers in person. I telephoned every other airline and if a flight had been available I would have booked it whatever the price! If you are offered a flight for nothing with this dreadful outfit please decline it.

### Phuket Air customer review
BKK-LGW with Phuket Air on 04-05-05 - total chaos!! Passengers on plane before us would not get back on plane after re-fueling at Sharjah - because of the "minor problem" of fuel leaking out of the engine! We flew in 2 days later to find them still waiting at Sharjah for our plane to pick them up. Bit of a problem though our plane was also leaking fluid from the engine (different plane). Waited in Sharjah for 16 hrs for the muppets to fix the plane (well kind of fix it). Don't fly with them - Dangerous ! !

### Phuket Air customer review
I have just arrived back in the UK after the journey from hell the April 02 flight 72 hours from Bangkok to Gatwick. After being stranded in Sharjah UAE for 60 hours and an almost total lack of communication from Phuket Air I can do nothing other than urge anyone who is planning on taking a flight to cancel their tickets immediately and find someone/anyone other than these clowns to travel with.

### Phuket Air customer review
Gatwick to BKK. Flight to BKK was excellent no problems. The plane was old but everything worked and the staff were excellent. Plenty of food and drinks were available on request. I flew back on 16 march and apart from the hour to refuel in Sharjah which is a little inconvenient the flight was excellent.

### Phuket Air customer review
Intrigued by Fern Tuppen's comments below. We were on the same LGW-BKK plane on the 24 February and condition wise the cabin was dirty and scruffy. Torn and stained seat covers and staff service was offhand to say the least. Are the staff the Thai Airways rejects because they really do not come close to the Thai standards. I agree about the flights not being full and have heard rumours that Phuket Air will have to cut these long haul flights because it is crippling the airline to keep losing money. I would not repeat the experience even though I admit it was cheap! I do have real concerns for the maintenance and safety standards for this outfit and fear the worst has yet to come for them.

### Phuket Air customer review
LGW to Bangkok out 24/2/05 back 10/3/05. I had been dreading it. Maybe we were just lucky. The planes are a bit old and tatty but no worse than others I've flown - in our case the ex-KLM both ways. We were in Economy and legroom and seat width was OK both flights were around half full so we had a row of 3 between the 2 of us - makes a world of difference! Service was excellent food better than average drinks available- although on request because the cabin crew don't hassle you much. Managed to get some kip on the way home which for me is unusual. Both flights were on time and devoid of trauma. Yes the plane stopped at Sharjah for about an hour and the toilets were cleaned and checked which took about 20 minutes.

### Phuket Air customer review
Myself and my partner flew Phuket Air to BKK in Oct 04. The flight over was ok the plane was an old KLM jumbo which was tatty but comfortable. I agree with the comments about the cabin crew not being able to handle drunken louts. On the flight out there were a group of middle age men who were served alcoholic drinks from the time of serving to just prior to landing. Although they didn't cause any trouble I was very surprised that the cabin crew continued to serve them over a period of 11 hours. Our return flight was a bit of a nightmare. Having spent 6 hours waiting in Bangkok airport we boarded the plane at midnight. Our take off time came and went 40 minutes passed and we were told nothing. Then the captain said we would be taking off in 10 minutes (no apology). This came and went then another announcement there was a problem loading the luggage and we would be taking off in 10 minutes. Again this came and went. One and a half hours passed before we finally started to move. This KLM jumbo was really in bad shape and was much worse than the plane on the flight over it was dirty my table was broken and we generally didnât feel that happy flying in it. As the plane turned the corner and revved the engine to join the runway there was the most horrendous smell of burning. We were sitting at the front end of the plane near to the kitchen in the nose cone. As the plane started to go down the runway the smell got much worse. All the cabin crew were up running about looking in all of the ovens trying to find the source of this smell. They all looked terrified which is pretty off putting to the passengers in the first place! The plane continued down the runway with the smell getting worse all the time. Even as the plane was taking off the crew continued to look for the problem. My partner and I were terrified as too seemed those people sitting around us. One lady even got us and asked the crew what was going on. They didnât really tell her. The plane climbed very slowly with this smell still present. Whilst we were still climbing the captain came out and sniffed about with all the cabin crew flapping around him then the co-pilot came out and done the same. I think everyone on the flight feared the worst. We honestly thought we were going to be blown out of the sky. About an hour later the smell went away but we couldnât settle after the adrenaline rush of panic. We also stopped in Sharjah which was awful as the air conditioning was switched off and we were delayed here too. We werenât given any drinks were told not to use the toilet and werenât allowed off the plane. Our journey home took us over 36 hours which marred the end of our holiday. I was most upset by the lack of information provided by the crew. We were not told about the burning problem or the cause of it or reassured about it there were no apologies at all. I would never fly Phuket air again nor recommend it. I am surprised that the BAA allows them to provide a long haul service from the UK.

LGW-BKK 05/02/05 and BKK-LGW 16/02/05 in Business Class. The flights were on time - Business Class cabin located upstairs and spacious quiet clean. Seats comfortable with good recline legroom and personal video display. Food was excellent and the service very friendly.

### Phuket Air customer review
I'm with Helen Brade. Was also on the 15th January flight with the 18 hrs delay. If I had known the real reason for the delay engine fire on outbound flight flight I wouldn't have flown with them at all. The planes are old noisy the reading lights don't work the TV screens are fuzzy and they should stay on the ground for good before a real disaster occurs. The crew are lovely but I didn't feel at all confident that they would be able to handle an emergency situation or one such as the drunk passenger described in Helen's posting. I was on the plane for a total of 17 hrs on the return flight on 12th Feb and this was a day early than scheduled as Phuket said 13th Feb flight cancelled when I called to reconfirm flight no explanation so I lost a day at the start of my holiday and a day at the end I won't be flying with them again. I flew to Bangkok from Laos a few days before my return flight and there were 5 Phuket Jumbos on the tarmac at Bangkok 3 with the engine covers open maybe routine but with all the information on this forum  it does make you wonder. I hope that they can sort out their problems but short of a new fleet I can't see it happening!

### Phuket Air customer review
Bangkok to London for myself and two children - 5/02/05 flight delayed 2 hours from Bangkok- no explanation given On boarding found no one at the entrance to plane so just wandered on and found our seats. Two of the three were broken and could not recline. A passenger behind us could not find her seat as shown on boarding pass. Eventually cabin crew discovered that the seat on aircraft did not exist and had to cross out a seat number using felt tip pen and write correct number up above. Overall impression of interior was very unpleasant and dim - hardly any light at all due to the very old aircraft used and no updating of interior. After taking off no hello from captain or any communication - it would have been courteous to know what the delay was . We never heard his voice throughout the flight. After arriving in Dubai the hour hour turned into 2hours 15 minutes- no cabin crew would tell me what the delay was for although I did see a Phuket Airlines engineer inspecting engines. Took off for final leg - at least this change of captain did mean that we heard his voice and he at least apologised for the 2 hour plus delay. I should mention that during the stop-over the engines were off and no aircon inside cabin which left most passengers very uncomfortable. Food was of low quality and beer i asked for was warm and not refrigerated. Crew were ok especially after seeing what they have to put up with. On arrival at Gatwick had to wait exactly 60 minutes for bags and with the extra delay of flight meant we missed our coach we had previously booked. Total flight time 18 hours (21 including arrival time at Bangkok - as we were told to arrive 3 hours before boarding?) After travelling for 20 years I can honestly say that this has been my worst experience ever and has put me off flying especially with children. I have to return to Thailand and would not fly Phuket Airlines if I was given free tickets - the whole experience from check in to arrival was most unpleasant.

### Phuket Air customer review
LGW-BKK return. Both flights on schedule no delays. Very happy with the service. The 747's on this fleet are very old but for 300 quid I didn't expect a champagne reception! The only annoyance was that I wasn't awoken when the visa forms came round. Caused me a slight delay getting through passport control! Going from most of the readers here I struck lucky! I will flying again with them soon will post results of that journey on my return.

### Phuket Air customer review
I was also booked for this flight. When we arrived at Bangkok airport for the return trip we were met with the same problems. Our group of four spoke to a supervisor and we were very lucky to get on the Qantas flight an hour later. I second everything the previous writer has said. Phuket Airlines are a shambles. Never again.

### Phuket Air customer review
Pleased with our experience on Phuket Air - flight out was a little dissapointing as they were old seats with little recline. But we were the only two in Business Class so were treated like royalty - the best staff I have encountered. Return was different - much improved seating with cradle style resulting in a good nights sleep - but the food wasn't quite as good. I would fly Phuket Air Business Class again - such a good deal.

### Phuket Air customer review
My friend and I were on the 14th January flight from Bangkok to Gatwick when the engine caught fire and we had to land back at Bangkok. What a total nightmare! I would urge anyone thinking of using Phuket Airlines to go with a reputable carrier and to avoid flying with them. Phuket Airlines in my opinion are a total shambles. Once we had landed back at Bangkok Airport there was no organisation no explanations just total chaos. None of the staff had a clue what was going on and how to handle the situation. We heard stories from other passengers about problems they had experienced on the way out as well mechanical problems very long delays etc. They are just not equiped to deal with big international flights. The reason they are so cheap is because they are so crap! The planes are very old and have definitely seen better days. Don't risk it pay the extra to fly with a decent airline is my advice you will feel safer and more confident and you will get much better service. We spent out Â£400 on a new return ticket as we were not prepared to fly back with them to London the following day. 13 hours is a long time to sit and worry whether their old plane will make it or not. I know alot of other people on our original flight bought new tickets as well some were on our Thai Airways flight back to Heathrow. My friend has since contacted Phuket Airlines here in the UK to take the matter further but surprisingly they aren't being very helpful - Phuket Airlines - bunch of cowboys in my opinion.

### Phuket Air customer review
I traveled with Phuket Airlines on 15th January 2005 our flight was supposed to leave Gatwick at 2pm that day. We arrived at the check in desk at 11am to be greeted with a rumor that the flight was 11 hours delayed! Eventually the check in desk opened and passengers were informed that there was an 18 hour delay on the flight no real explanation was given but after looking at this web page I now know why. Apparently the flight which left Bangkok on 14th January had to make an emergency landing due to an engine fire. I can honestly say that after my experience with Phuket Airlines this does not surprise me in the least. I have never come across such an inefficient incompetent and unprofessional organization. The flight eventually left London Gatwick at 8.30am the following morning. The service left a lot to be desired passengers were fed a poor quality meal just after take off were not given another hot meal until 8 hours later. The aircraft used was severely weathered and that is putting it mildly (ex KLM fleet). On our return flight several televisions were broken and the audio equipment on many seats did not work. Our return journey turned into a complete nightmare in anticipation of a further delay we contacted Phuket Air in Bangkok on 28th January informing them that we were due to fly out on 29th only to be informed that the flight would be delayed 12 hours and would not be leaving until 30th January but we still had to be at the check in for 9pm on 29th. We were also informed that we would be put on a standby list with Thai Airways for a flight out that night and the earlier we arrived the more chance we had of getting on that flight. The main problem with Phuket Air is that they do not have the fleet or the organizational capacity to operate on an international basis. Check-in eventually opened at 9.30pm and we were informed that there was no standby list and no prospect of getting on another flight! We had to return the next morning at 7.30am to check in. Again further annoyance as passengers began to queue up at 7am only to be told that check in would not open until 8.30am. The flight was scheduled to leave at 10.30am and eventually took of at 12.30pm due to further âtechnical difficultiesâ! The flight home was horrendous the airline does not seem to have any regard for passenger safety as they allowed a seriously drunken passenger to board the flight in Bangkok. He was that drunk he could barely stand up. He then proceeded to seriously harass the passengers on board walking around the plane for several hours causing grave concern. The cabin crew had no control whatsoever over the situation. After four hours we were shocked to be informed that despite numerous requests from passengers the Captain had not been informed about this disruptive passenger. The flight made a scheduled stop in Sharjah to re-fuel this in itself defies all logic as it manages to make the outward journey with out stopping and only serves to turn an 11 hour flight into 15 hours. We were subsequently informed that the only reason why they do this is because itâs cheaper to re-fuel. Eventually after half an hour of being on the ground the drunken lout was removed from the plane and his baggage off loaded. After a 14 hour delay and a 15 hour long flight you do not need the stress! With the price of tickets being so cheap regrettably Phuket Air has opened up the market for the typical English larger lout. If you have already booked tickets with Phuket Air I pity your misfortune if not escape now and use a reputable airline that will not destroy your holiday and most of all not compromise your safety!

17/12/04-07/01/05 LGW-BKK. Our 3rd flight with Phuket Airlines and never again - the planes are a disgrace faulty seats lights etc - the food is awful the toilets backed up (I'll leave that to your imagination). The first and second flights with them weren't too bad because the planes were only a third full - so plenty of room and slept all the way. Got decent service when awake but the third flight with being peak season was fully booked and a nightmare - it is practically impossible to get a drink even though the staff are really friendly as they are so busy. The fuel stop is a nightmare and the flights shouldn't really be sold as direct because they're not. Check in at Gatwick is okay but at Bangkok allow 2 hours at peak season - very disorganised which leaves no time to go to duty free. A friend of ours was on Bangkok to Gatwick 14/01/05 and 5 minutes out of Bangkok they had to return and do an emergency landing - the engine was on fire. Apparently this also happened 3 weeks before christmas. I'd rather pay more and feel safe and be able to get good service.

### Phuket Air customer review
BKK-LGW Business Class - just got back this morning from this flight. The 747-300 really is showing its age however they have done a great job refurbishing the upper deck. The seat pitch at 58-60 inches is the most generous I have experienced in business class and with only 7 rows it feels very spacious. There are no seat motors so it's all manually operated but the seats are extremely comfortable and the recline is excellent. Unfortunately the same cannot be said of the standard of catering. I have travelled on eleven different airlines' long haul business class and the dinner served on this flight was the worst I have ever experienced in business class - by a very long way. In fact I have had much better meals in other airlines' economy class. Also only one white and one red wine was offered both very mediocre and no after dinner drinks. The breakfast served on the second leg was of a much higher standard though. There was a choice of 6 movies but no menu so that I had to ask one of the crew to write them down! The stop in Sharjah to refuel was a real pain as it made the whole flight last 15 hours. So great seats and polite service but very poor food and wine. On the way out there was a 17 hour delay due to technical problems. They knew about this the day before but didn't bother to phone any passengers to let them know! We got transferred to the Thai Airlines flight from Heathrow which had great food and service but the worst seats. I have experienced in business class!

### Phuket Air customer review
They are cheap and they are cheap for a reason! - 2 stories of incompetence - First my brother took the LGW to BKK economy return in May 2004. Outbound no problem. Return flight they dumped all the passengers in the middle of the desert (Dubai) and abandoned the flight due to supposed technical failure but later we discovered they had missed their landing slot at Gatwick. Absolute chaos at Dubai airport and the one lady Phuket airline staff deserted her post and left 300+ passengers stranded. All the Phuket Airlines officials did a runner! No explanations given! After 5 hours of irate passengers spitting nails â an Emirates official grasped the nettle and re- scheduled everybody back to Heathrow or Gatwick on Emirates flights. My brother was delayed around 8 hours. Story no. 2 - thinking maybe my brother had a âone off experienceâ I flew out same route economy class Â£456 LGW to BKK in August. Outbound no problem decent flight with average service. Return flight I re-confirmed my flight 72 hours prior with booking reference. Reached BKK airport 3 hours before departure and 3 queues were about 50 metres long already! - and hardly moving. It took an amazing 3 and half hours to eventually reach the desk as the staff were spending 80% of their time on walkie talkies. By the time I reached the desk I was told by the check in girl that the flight was overbooked and I couldnât fly that day! â Charming! Itâs now 2.30 am I am dog tired and no Phuket flights for 3 days! â They transferred about 8 of us to a nice hotel and put us on standby for BA/Quantas. Yes âstandbyâ at peak holiday season! â no guarantee of getting home for 3 days ... lucky B.A. had a seat the next night back to Heathrow (not LGW) making my home train ticket invalid to Sheffield. I complained by email to Phuket Airlines (their website is useless). It appears that standby passengers were let onto our flight whilst valid ticket holders like myself were denied access. No reply by email but did eventually receive a letter reply 3 months later. A long convoluted generalised statement about overbooking problems and didnât address the real issues. If you want to save money and take a risk go ahead and book - but for me Phuket Airlines nay more!

Just back from Bangkok. Direct flight over was good with good food. Stopover on the way back to London was a real pain! Old jumbo which was quite noisy and made it hard to sleep. Poor choice of movies/tv programmes shown. Passengers had no control over their personal lights on the way back which was quite strange so unable to read in the dark.

LGW-BKK. Old Thai Airways 747 but service and food excellent. Had emergency exit seat but so few people on flight 3 seats were possible for lots of people to stretch out. BKK-LGW Old jumbo emergency exit seat again but only 120 passengers!! I have never seen so many people sleeping! They can't keep going with this loading. Again staff and food excellent. Fuel stop in Dubai though. Paid Â£313 all in. Will travel again and hope for same luck.

LGW-BKK return - Club Class. Pleased with the service. Aircraft are ex-KLM but everything was working attendants first class and the food good. Had to make a fuel stop on the outbound flight. Old aircraft and fuel stop has to be set against low cost. Its your decision but I will use again.

London-Bangkok vv Business Class. Check in was great with no queue when we checked in for our flight 90 mins prior to departure. As a small airline they use the Aviance Lounge at Gatwick which although fine was being used by some grotty Easyjet passengers who had obviously paid to access the lounge. On the flight out the 747 300 business class seats left a lot to be desired with very little recline. However the cabin crew made up for this with an exemplary service. Food was superb and again made even better by the wonderful cabin crew. On the return the business class cabin was a newly refurbished one with the best seats I have ever experienced in c class. Although cradle rather than lie flat I had the best nights sleep of the whole holiday. All in all as they are upgrade their cabin interiors I think Phuket Air are fabulous and would fly with them again.

LGW-BKK-HKT return. As you can see we had two internal flights - to Phuket and back. Firstly I must agree with all other comments food good quick check in offered exit seats with legroom staff friendly but not very professional. Thai greeting towels ok toilets very clean  and not very good in flight entertainment. Then it comes to the 8 hour delay at Bangkok( after a 12 hour flight) on our domestic flight to phuket. We roamed the airport aimlessly for 8 hours - not good. we were promised a transfer to Thai Airways which was not going to happen as the plane was full - bad news. Then they kept our cases at the desk and said they would be checked in for us ( along with seven other passengers cases) but when we got to Phuket we had no cases ( the other seven did) We waited until the next afternoon before they arrived at our hotel - which really meant we lost a whole day of doing nothing. It gets worse. We had to rearrange our Pick Ups at the airport. Then all this happened on the return flight from Phuket to Bankgkok. 4 hours delay. Also the food was cold on both domestic flights. The flight to LGW via Dubai was long and hot - we didn't just refuel - but off and onloaded cargo which took nearly two hours I'm sure. I timed the return flight - 15 hours 1am to 4pm. I would never use them for domestic flight ever again and only if I couldn't get another flight would I use them for international flight. Would not recommend.

I just completed an LGHW-BKK-LGW roundtrip on Phuket air and my feelings are mixed for sure - checkin was swift and I was immediately offered and exit seat - empty flight out so I actually had that exit row to myself - food delicious but quantities somewhat meagre and left me ravenous in midflight - I must echo the others by saying that the aircraft are not the most comfy and are really showing their age - the IFE is a mess. Staff not to be faulted. The check in agent at BKK lied to me for some reason telling me that I would certainly have 3 seats to myself as the flight was half empty [it was about 95% full in reality!] - the stop in Dubai makes the flight home almost intolerable as we cannot get off [that is at least 15 or 16 hours in that thing!]

Gatwick - Bangkok return.Check in & boarding at Gatwick was a breeze no one waiting for either. On entering the 747-300 & all the way to the rear each cabin crew member gives the traditional Thai greeting. A bit late leaving due to a few missing passengers these prehistoric aircraft are not comfortable when stationary. There is no individual air con & no air moves around the cabin until the aircraft is in flight. Quite a few of the pax were fanning themselves with the inflight leaflet. Hot cloth towels were offered but were strangely dry. Drinks/peanuts & dinner of green chicken curry or salmon fillet with rice - a chickpea salad & strawberry tart. Plenty of offers of wine & tea/coffee. Flight both ways were not full so had a 3 seat row going & the last econ middle row on return. Legroom varies on the way I had about 32" pitch. Entertainment is via overhead screens. Drinks available throughout the flight & all service calls answered straight away. The crew very friendly taking time to talk to pax & to answer any questions. Coming back check in at BKK a nightmare 4 desks open 60% full flight but still took over an hour. Took off straight into a very bad thunderstorm. The plane rattled rolled dipped upped & went all over the place for about an hour. The crew sitting either side of me looked very nervous! Once everything was stable the same good service. Slept most of the way back. The plane refuels in DXB but no major hassles - front & rear door open so air moves through cabin no problem if pax wish to stand by doors again crew happy to chat one was even helping a pax with stretching exercises. More drinks & sandwiches after takeoff & breakfast before landing at LGW. Luggage took usual time for to come through. Not a bad airline - staff great but some of their inexperience shows & they need to upgrade the aircraft.

Flew London to Bangkok return  arriving back on 28 August. The plus point was the courtesy of their cabin staff very polite and helpful. There were three major minus points. Old planes lights not working so you coudn't read small TV screens shared by many passengers. Refuelling at Dubai on the way back. Never mentioned when I booked. The flight back took a total of over 13 hours. When I reconfirmed more than 72 hours of departure I was told the flight was full. They sorted it out after an hour and I was OK but not what you need. I won't be using them again.

I recently flew Air Phuket from Gatwick to Bangkok and return. I found the staff to be very efficient and helpful. However the planes they are using (old planes from KLM) are well past their sell by date. The noise was terrible and half of the planes audio system's didn't work so it was a long flight without any films etc. The drinks service left a lot to be desired - one drink after take off and one drink with your meal was the only alcohol allowed. On the return flight we had to stop at Dubai for refuelling - had to stop on the plane for over an hour in a great deal of heat. I for one (and a lot of other passengers) will not be using them again.

My wife is Thai and her home town is near Buriram in NE Thailand we have to fly Bangkok-Buriram when we go there. Phuket Air recently took over the route from Air Andaman. We were very impressed for a small airline much better than Air Andaman Very smart cabin crew - good service. Served a small snack which was quite tasty for only a 45 minute flight. They have recently started flying Bangkok to London Gatwick so would be interested to find out what they are like long haul.
