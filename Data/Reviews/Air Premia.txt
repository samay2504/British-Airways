### "the nerve to refuse compensation"
My flight with this disgraceful airline turned into a 20-hour hostage situation, and they have the nerve to refuse compensation. Departing Flight: Scheduled: 7:00 AM Actual Departure: 9:00 PM (11-hour delay!) Result: Missed an entire day of my trip, wasted at the airport Return Flight: Scheduled: 12:00 PM Actual Departure: 9:30 PM (9.5-hour delay!) And what did they offer? No refund, no voucher, not even an apology. Their customer service response? Delays happen. If they canâ€™t operate flights on time, they must refund passengers, not treat us like fools.

### "inflight entertainment is sparse"
Not Verified | This is a good airline with more legroom than most for economy and I have taken it a few times already this year, but I am considering switching to United from now on. The inflight entertainment is sparse. And even the little that they have is almost useless to non-Koreans because they do not have subtitles. Somewhat related to above, United now has Starlink, giving me not only entertainment options from my laptop but the ability for me to be online. I like the extra legroom of Air Premia, but fast and free unlimited internet service is very compelling.

### "legroom is the biggest selling point"
The flight attendants are top notch - service is gracious and consistent. Little things like coming by often to take trash, asking your preferences clearly, and sincere friendliness that I think is sadly lacking in some airlines these days. I don't know how they manage to do it but the eggs are truly good. Also, this is the only airline in which I was served a dish I tried to recreate once I got home - a corn salad with red onions and feta. Delicious. They do not serve typical Korean food but all I ask of airline food in economy is that the food not be disgusting. Air Premia's dishes can actually be described as good. The legroom in economy is by far the biggest selling point of this airline. Even though their entertainment options are severely limited, I am completely happy with economy on Air Premia.

### "staff was young and energetic"
I have been to Asia 37 times and found Air Premia by accident. They really do not market in the United States. This airline could easily be a leader in the industry but for paying attention to the basics. Serve a decent meal on a long haul flight. The food was simplest the worse I have ever eaten on an airline. Offer more than a dozen movies and tv shows only in one language with subtitles is boring. Why fly a Boeing 787-9 aircraft with all the modern features to service the public and then not use them. But there are far more positives to be considered. The premium economy was like flying business. Plenty of room to relax while crossing the Pacific. The staff was young and energetic. They hustled to make sure everyone for top notch attention despite being forced to serve dog food. The entire crew was also very safety aware. Whomever is in charge of this airline needs to be fired and replaced by an expert that understands inflight service.
