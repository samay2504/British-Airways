### "Very poor customer service"
Very poor customer service. Failure to resolve the issue of the Swissport agent damaging my bag. Filthy aircraft, customer service not fit for purpose

### "this is a great service"
City of Derry is a small regional airport, however, check in was very straight forward the Logan Air staff were very friendly. The security process was a little over the top however, it was fast. There is a small cafe within the terminal and its servers’ drinks and snacks which was more than sufficient for the short wait prior to boarding the aircraft. Boarding the flight was by seat number, however, this was orderly and efficient. The flight from City of Derry to London takes just over 1 hour. The cabin crew are extremely friendly and provided some tea/coffee and biscuits. After landing the plane was parked in a remote apron, however there was a bus to take us to the terminal upon arrival. My luggage was also coming out of the carousal by the time we got to the terminal, which meant I was on my way to next destination very quickly. Overall, this is a great service by Loganair from a regional airport.

### "not book with this airline again"
Not Verified |   Avoid if you ever want any help. Specifically booked Loganair due to flight times. Email received of flight change to 4 hours before I booked. Which is now too early for me to be able to board as getting off a cruise ship on the same day and will not make it to the airport in time for checking in. Completely un-helpful support team who have only advised that I can change to another day as there are no more flights on this day and not to forget no refund due as apparently a 4 hour schedule change is reasonable. So now I need to pay for new flights with a different airline or spend more money to stay over another night! Or I can fly to Newcastle? Miles away from where I need to be. Ridiculous that they pretend these are actually alternatives. Will absolutely not book with this airline again.

### "Absolute nightmare"
Absolute nightmare, lost my luggage in both directions, refused me to board the aircraft despite boarding pass in hand. 7 hour delay ant Heathrow, and no Loganair staff available at all.

### "avoid this company at all costs"
Please avoid this company at all costs. I booked (through work, this was a business trip) a flight on 6th March. Flight was scheduled to take off at 06:55, this flight was delayed by 2 hours then circled Heathrow for a another 45 mins before we could land. Ok, I accept these things happen. The attendant on the flight was miserable and made no effort whatsoever to make any apology for the delay and potential impact for those travelling. Then the next day I arrive at Heathrow at 7:15 for a 09:45 flight to be told it was cancelled, no reason provided (and I know the flight the evening before was also cancelled as this effected my colleague) there was no one available to talk to, don't bother trying to call them, you are pushed back to the website that tells you nothing. I was left in Heathrow airport for nearly 10 hours, and my only option was a flight to Edinburgh (I flew out from Dundee where my car was) as a female travelling alone you have absolutely no way to talk to anyone from Loganair. I have emailed them today and this is the response to my request for a refund 'The booking was made by an agent, please contact them regarding the refund for the cancelled flight. Regards. Help Centre Supervisor'. No apology, no acknowledgement of my concerns, nothing! My employer will never use them again. Regularly travel and book my travel through my employers portal, and delays and refunds are provided to the individual (employee) who has suffered the inconvenience. It was not the agent sitting in Heathrow for ten hours, it was me. Not so much as a glass of water was provided. No indication of concern or duty of care to females travelling alone was shown from this absolutely shambolic company. Please please avoid. I

### "All staff were very helpful"
I was very nervous as was flying on my own for the first time and with my young child. All staff were very helpful from the minute we walked into the airport. The lady who booked us in was so considerate. When we got on to the plane we were met by Joanie, she was so welcoming and involved Samuel straight away. Joanie then went above and beyond during the flight to make sure we were ok and to help me keep Samuel occupied. She was so kind and thoughtful and was very complementary about his behaviour. To absolutely blow us away she let us meet Johnathan and Catherine (I hope I have names right?) this made Samuel’s day. He couldn’t stop smiling. Please pass on my heartfelt thanks to them all, what a super team. I will definitely be using Loganair again.

### "cabin was extremely friendly and welcoming"
Flew on Loganair on flight No. LM-0651 from City of Derry Airport to London Heathrow. It was an early morning; however, check-in was fast and efficient. Check in staff were very friendly. City of Derry airport is a small regional airport, however the service for early morning check was good. We took off on schedule and during the flight there was tea, coffee and biscuits serviced. The cabin was extremely friendly and welcoming. We land in Heathrow ahead of schedule and luggage was delivered very quickly. I was very impressed by the service provided Loganair on this flight.

### "The service was reasonably good"
Before booking my return flight from Edinburgh to Southampton, I was horrified after reading the unfavourable comments given to this airline that I nearly wanted not to book with it. In the end, I decided to fly with them. I felt I need to counter balance those unfavourable comments as they did not reflect the experience I had flying with this airline. The service was reasonably good. The flights (Edinburgh to Southampton, and Southampton to Edinburgh) both took off on time. The inflight staff were friendly, and they even served coffee and a small snack. The luggage arrived on time as well. Only thing I could say is some seats on the aircraft looked a bit worn out, but for a flight of just over an hour, it was not too bad. I would fly with the airline again if the domestic airfare is not so high. Next time, if I were to travel to Edinburgh to Southampton, I would probably drive as this would save me money. That doesn't mean I would not recommend flying this airline, because I would.

### "a total absence of customer service"
Not Verified |  I use this airline frequently because it is the only airline serving Orkney. If you are coming to Orkney and are able to use the ferries then do so, this airline is a disgrace, frequently delayed and cancelled and a total absence of customer service. However I would say that the cabin staff are fantastic, it is just a shame they are stuck working for this airline.

### "11 hours delay and cancellation"
Avoid if you want to get to your destination. Is simple as that. 11 hours delay and cancellation in the end at Cardiff Airport for a 55 minutes flight to Edinburgh! Sent a message the day before indicating a two hours delay. The company already knew there was a problem but still gone ahead and asked to check in as normal. Nobody from the company available to speak to. Cardiff Airport staff all 4 of them in the whole Airport no manager between them, taken two hours just to arrange taxis and accommodation. Including passengers who were disabled in wheel chairs, and a mother with 4 week old baby and a child with her. We given a flight option for evening flight next day. Precious time wasted never to be seen again. Annual leave, hotel bookings and life experience.

### "never look forward to using this service"
Over an hour delayed. This is consistent with every time I have used this airline. Very frustrating considering their cost. Staff at airport didn't seem to care. One tried to prevent a customer from using the toilet which was located out with the gate we were sat waiting (no facilities provided - yes this is Bristol airport's problem, yet she should have been more considerate). When I went to advance check in online I was told it would be a £6 charge to select a seat otherwise I would be randomly allocated one, even though I was travelling with my partner who was scared of flying. Overall never look forward to using this service.

### "avoid Loganair like the plague"
Not Verified |  A word of warning - avoid Loganair like the plague. More of a joke than an airline really. I lost a day of my trip when my outbound flight was cancelled. My inbound flight was delayed by 2.5 hours so I missed my onward flight last night. Next flight to Norwich is on Sunday so they wanted to put me in a hotel for two days. When I booked a flight for the next day on another airline and asked them to cancel my flight they then washed their hands of me and I had to sort my own hotel last night. This morning I arrived at the airport at 5.30am. Loganair have 5 flights on the departure board - 3 of those are already delayed by an hour or more. Their staff don’t seem to give a stuff - I guess they deal with so many inconvenienced people that they are over it as well.

### "unbelievable customer service"
Avoid this airline when possible. The Birmingham to Isle of Man check in desk open 40 minutes late, the plane as then delayed on 3 occasions and then cancelled without an announcement just a text message sent when sitting at departure gate. No one from Loganair to explain cancellation or how to retrieve luggage or go back through security. Over 2.5 hours to get out of airport and entire plane full of passengers only helped by a member of airport cleaning staff for the first hour. Appalling and unbelievable customer service by this airline.

### "We will never book with Loganair again"
Not Verified |  If I could wind the clock back I definitely would not book with Loganair. Firstly after booking and having chosen our flights we got an email saying both flights were to be moved to early morning which would mean the added expense of an overnight stay at an airport hotel for us. Then when we needed to cancel because our son had to attend GCSE revision sessions, we discovered there was no way of cancelling. The only option was to change flights which we did not want to do and even this would incur a charge that was nearly as much as the flights in the first place. We will never book with Loganair again and would recommend that anybody considering it looks elsewhere if at all possible

### "like to express huge gratitude"
I am writing a separate review for this return trip, because I would like to express huge gratitude to the Loganair ground staff at Kirkwall. Never felt so silly in my flying ‘career’, but I managed to book a return flight for a wrong date, and found this out only at the check-in counter. What I would like to outline is not the fact that I was eventually rebooked on an earlier flight (had a FlexPlus fare so it was assumed), but how the staff cared. The initial morning flight had to be delayed and aircraft promptly replaced for a smaller one due to crew sickness: the ground staff had to manage 80+ passengers, most of whom went on vacation with families and were missing their flight connections: they resolved the situation very efficiently (I assume it is not easy to find alternative flights when flying out from a small island in the middle of nowhere known for an awful weather) and remained kind during the process. And in the middle of this all, the check-in manager found me out from the crowd in the departure hall and personally presented me with a new boarding pass, thus, solving my own mess in addition to the problems they had on the plate. Amazing job and great example for many regional operations! Cherry on top, the flight great as well, with a very lovely crew.

### "gave a fantastic impression on me"
For a regional airline, Loganair gave a fantastic impression on me. It was expensive (£200 one way), however, I booked at the very last minute at the FlexPlus fare. Lovely ground experience (my bag was too big to be brought inside the cabin and the manager just kindly offered to place it in the cargo hold), excellent flight crew and lovely service (delicious cookies, cold and hot beverages). Seats were comfortable for a turbo-prop and what I also liked very much was that the ATR-72 was not as noisy as, say, Dash-8. One thing I would suggest is that they introduce a fully refundable fare instead of just allowing to change flights with no charge.

### "Customer service extremely slow to respond"
Return flight but outbound was cancelled at extremely short notice. Was on way to Heathrow on tube when flight was cancelled. Had to find a way to travel 200 plus miles that evening at short notice. Not covid related, and claimed compensation immediately. Two months later no sign of my fare or compensation. I made the return journey successfully a few days later but irritating to have to chase my money for their breach of contract when the law is clear. Customer service extremely slow to respond.

### "possibly the best ever"
Flew Edinburgh to Stornaway on Fri 25th June. Flight no LM0343 at 12:10 hrs. The cabin stewardess (possibly called Jenna) was possibly the best ever. Her attention to the passengers and general persona was fantastic. Whatever Loganair are paying her, its not enough!

### "definitely be flying again with you"
I recently used Loganair and had the best experience flying with my daughter for her first time. The staff were very friendly and Matthew on board was amazing to me and my daughter, very friendly, he was a big part in my experience made it so easy for us and was so good with my daughter making her smile and laugh I couldn’t thank him enough! We also met the pilots who were very friendly and made us laugh and at ease with us both. Just want to say once again a massive thank you to everyone at Loganair, will definitely be flying again with you!

### "moved our flight to the following day"
Not Verified |  Has this airline ever ran a flight at the date/time that it is supposed to? Me and a my partner had a flight booked to Exeter and my girlfriend also had a flight book for a return 2 days later. A few weeks later, Loganair called and informed her that the return flight had been cancelled, so she had to rebook with another company. On the date of me writing this review, the flight is supposed to be leaving but upon checking the flight status I have found out that they moved our flight to the following day without informing us. Turns out because someone had phoned my partner to confirm the return cancellation, they left a note on the system saying that they had already contacted us so they never informed us of the change in date for the flight there. To sum up, we have had two flights booked with this company, one cancelled, one moved date. That cannot be just bad luck. We will be asking for a refund, as well as compensation for the flight booked that we no longer require due to their incompetence.

### "How unhelpful this small (and small minded) company is"
Not Verified |  We booked a trip to Edinburgh with Loganair last January, sadly all the events etc were subsequently cancelled due to Covid, we had no option other than to cancel our flights - Loganair would not offer us a refund only a credit note valid until August 2021. (Interesting that all the attractions we had planned to visit issued refunds immediately). Recently contacted Loganair to clarify the position re our credit note, it is difficult to plan ahead with so much turmoil and uncertainty. Loganair will not extend the time period for the validity of their voucher! How unhelpful this small (and small minded) company is.

### "Loganair refuses to refund me the money"
This airline is engaged in unethical behavior. The Loganair flight I booked was canceled by Loganair. Loganair refuses to refund me the money I paid for the booking. Do not book a flight on Loganair under any conditions

### "This was a great surprise"
Not Verified |  This was a great surprise as we have never flown Loganair before and expected a noisy prop jet, instead we had a small jet both ways. The ground staff were amazing as I requested a wheelchair for my husband at the last moment and they looked after him really well. It was a lovely smooth flight both ways and it took around an hour to reach our destination. We hope they continue to stay flying from Southampton as this is the best flight on that route we have ever had. I would certainly recommend the airline.

### "heard nothing from Loganair"
Not Verified |  I booked & paid fully for a return flight from Glasgow to Donegal for 22 May 20 returning on 25th May'20 On 16th March I received an email from Loganair informing me that my flight was being rerouted to Derry instead of Donegal. As this was unsuitable I requested a refund & on 18th March they agreed to & said it would take 28 days to process. However when I contacted them again in May as I still hadn't received the refund I was told it would take 60-90 days to process. It still hasn't been processed & I've heard nothing from Loganair.

### "they would not give me a refund"
Not Verified |  I was supposed to be flying from Glasgow to Stornaway today with another 8 family members, we were going to a family wedding on the Isle of Harris. Due to Corona virus the wedding, hotel and flight were cancelled. When i tried to get a refund from Loganair they would not give me a refund only the offer of flights valid for 1 year? With people's commitments it would be very difficult to get together again with work and other commitments, they are just saying you can go when ever you wish the whole point was to go together for this great occasion? Absolutely sick about the outcome and the expense.

### "No alcohol is permitted"
A good commuter service serving Derry in Northern Ireland to Southend. This recently changed from Stansted on this route but there is a minimal time difference on reaching central London by train or car. The airline has the benefit of an included service to allow you an optional free airport check in, advance seat allocation and an included baggage allowance. Pre-booking a seat, you may have reassigned due to the number of passengers and pay-load. The check in staff and cabin crew are all friendly and professional. There is a basic beverage service on board accompanied by a biscuit/snack. I asked for some water and was presented with a small cup with a peel off lid. This is rarely offered by most airlines and is a good positive for the airline. Perhaps a complimentary newspaper could be an addition at the gate! But overall the seats are good flights are good and the interior well maintained. I signed up for the Clan Loganair loyalty programme and was sent a Hogmanay voucher over the New Year period. Having booked several flights with them I was disappointed they did not honour the voucher when I tried to redeem it. I wrote a letter of complaint and they explained they would not honour this one off voucher. They accepted it was valid and in date but would not process this as the booking was already made. I have though booked other flights with them since as the airline crew make up for the poor commitment and response I received from the marketing and customer service team. My only negative comment is for a 90 minute flight it would be nice to have a glass of wine or a Beer on board as No alcohol is permitted. In this day and age this would not be too much to ask.

### "Loganair is an excellent option"
The fastest, stress-free, beautiful way to travel to the Queen of the Hebrides - the island of Islay, famous for its single malt peat smoked whiskies! Loganair operates out of Glasgow airport to this remote location several times a day. The Saab 340 has 34 seats and has two propellers. The seat was comfortable. The plane was only half full. The flight attendant moved passengers around the the cabin to ensure "balance". It felt quaint and reminded me of the many Saab 340 flights I had taken from Detroit to Marquette (MQT) on Northwest Airlines (before Delta once it acquired Northwest retired them and replaced with CRJs). The actual flight time was less than 30 minutes and the views of the country side, the indented coastlines, and the landing over the waters were a pleasure to behold. The sole flight attendant ensured that safety rules were communicated and followed. She was dressed in the red and black tartan uniform, the colors of this Scotland based airliner. No food or drink service on this wee plane on this short flight. Given the limited space in the cabin, even carry on bags, had to be checked in. No charge. Check in at the Glasgow and Islay airports (for the return) were smooth and went off without a glitch. The alternate to the flights would have been a very long and ardous car/bus drive followed by a ferry crossing lasting for another at least over a couple of hours. The Loganair is an excellent option to ensure you can spend more time on the island. It was an enjoyable flying experience, especially since, at least at Islay, you can arrive at the airport only minutes before the flight takes off.

### "found the experience very enjoyable"
Derry to Stansted. I have never been on a small airoplane before, but I found the experience very enjoyable. The air steward was most pleasant and helpful, and the free snack was a bonus, unlike another airline I used to travel on that charged a lot for anything. Highly recommend!

### "Delayed yet again"
Edinburgh to Wick. Delayed yet again, becoming more and more part of the trip. They do not care the delay has on onward travel. Commented to a gate staff female employee and was told “nothing to do with me, there is no pilot". Great customer service - not.

### "these flights are superb"
Not Verified |  Travelled out on the Tuesday morning flight from Glasgow at 7am, slight 20 mins delay, but the flight now only takes about 35 mins in these newer Jet Engined planes, instead ot the Turbo Props which used to be used on this route. Offered a Drink and a snack with it, which was nice, and touched down enjoying some lovely scenery on The Isle of Lewis just after 8am. Back again on the 4.35 flight from Stornoway to Glasgow on the Wednesday, delayed 25mins due to the Island Air Traffic Control, but again, great flight and a snack and cup of tea some photos out over the Scottish Islands below, then straight back into Glasgow. Good flights, slightly expensive, but the ferry takes the best part of a day if you travel up from Glasgow, so these flights are superb, and now there are 4 daily return flights.

### "professional and friendly"
Glasgow to Stornoway. Loganair provide an excellent service to Scotland. The crew are all professional and friendly, the airline is run very well. Its always a pleasure flying with Loganair.

### "service not now become operational"
Belfast to Carlisle. I booked a return flight with LoganAir in April for a journey in the middle of June which required an overnight stay in Carlisle. I recently received an email to say that this service will not now become operational until September and the flights have been cancelled. This was because "changing circumstances around the airport’s staffing means that this cannot be completed in time to receive scheduled flights as planned on 4 June". I booked a room which, not thinking anything would be amiss, was non-refundable. Apparently booking a hotel room is treated as being inconsequential even where there is an overnight stay (perhaps I should sleep rough!?) and cannot be refunded.

### "the attitude was abysmal"
Islay to Glasgow. Through no fault of ours the flight was delayed which meant we missed our connecting flight to London To say the attitude was abysmal and non caring is an understatement. We were treated as of it wasn't anyone's fault but ours. An absolute disgrace with regard to customer service.

### "delayed by 2 hours"
Islay to Glasgow. Appalling customer service. We were delayed by 2 hours so we missed our connecting flight. Loganair took no responsibility and we've had to wait 11 hours overnight at the airport for the next available flight and pay for a new onward flight even though Loganair is meant to be in partnership with BA. From talking to locals at the airport, it seems this is a regular occurrence. Also, having said they'd make sure our bags came off first, they were actually the last 2 bags off! What a hopeless service. I won't be using them again and would suggest getting the ferry instead.

### "outbound and return flights were excellent"
Flew Glasgow to Stornoway. Both the outbound and return flights were excellent with good practical service from the air hostess and the ground staff. Their website is easy to use. The seats and space are of a decent size for economy - how many airlines can truly say that! On the way back I had to stay in Stornoway for 2 more nights because of the snow on the mainland - the young man running the check-in quickly and efficiently arranged hotel, meals and taxi without any prompting. I suppose the really great thing about Loganair was that you received quality individual customer service appropriate to the circumstances and needs. It is way ahead of other flying experiences I have had - unless paying a small fortunate for elite classes. I do hope they can maintain this standard of service. I have joined there flying club and if they do maintain the standard of service it will be well worth sticking with them on relevant routes.

### "polite, chatty. and friendly"
Flew Loganair from Stornoway to Edinburgh. The flight was a relatively quiet one, but the single cabin crew member was polite, chatty and friendly. Take-off was in strong winds but the aircraft was handled with skill, and the in-flight complimentary service was not disrupted. The In-flight service was comprehensive, offering a breakfast option and drink. The entire experience was like stepping back in time to a more luxurious period.

### "I cannot praise them enough"
My flight from Manchester to Norwich on 21st December was unavoidably delayed due to heavy fog in Norwich. The pilot came out to the passengers to  explain this and paid particular attention to two elderly customers who were in wheelchairs, even offering his (only) coat to one. He stayed with us the entire time and updated us constantly. The cabin crew brought us mince pies and were very comforting. I cannot praise them enough for the service provided and won't hesitate to recommend & use them again. The flight itself was smooth and the pilot landed safely in tremendously awful thick cloud. Thank you.

### "great customer service"
Flew Loganair from Barra to Glasgow. Very nice airline with a great customer service. Our flight for the next day should be canceled because of a storm, so we got booked to a flight one day before to get our onward international flight for sure. Aircraft was small but okay and the pilots did a great job to keep it silent.

### Loganair customer review
Great service from a great little airline operating on behalf of Flybe. The Dornier 328 is a comfortable aircraft, albeit a little small. The sole cabin crew member was polite, professional, very friendly and chatty. Complimentary snacks and drinks were served and the flights were on time departing and arrived early. In fact, the outbound flight only took 31 minutes, a record according to the crew.
