### "the worst service I have experienced"
On this not exactly Blue1 cheap flight (where you don't expect much) the service was terrible. We had two very small children with us and we didn't get anything for them (no greeting, no good seats, no extra-treatment) like we got at other airlines of the same price range and although it was a lunchtime flight (12-15pm) there was nothing to eat offered - only tea, coffee and water. Not even juice for the kids! And once the service started the stewardess skipped our row (the one with the 2 babies!) and continued the service further down and the other stewardess parked her cart right in front of our row for about 5-10 minutes (I'm not exaggerating) serving other guests, collecting something here and there while my kids were crying because they saw the water in front of their eyes and were thirsty. After waiting forever I asked the stewardess behind me whether I could please get some water, she told me to talk to her colleague. When I finally catch her attention, was so grumpy that I had complained that she looked like she wanted to pour the drinks on my lap. The worst service I have experienced.

HEL-OSL. Check-in was rude and dismissive but otherwise the flight had very nice crew and the plane was spotless clean as well. BOB meal is cheaper on Blue1 than on SAS due to the currency and I found the quality to be rather reasonable as well. On-time departure and arrival in Oslo. Ticket price was great as usual.

HEL-BLQ-HEL. Check-in in Helsinki was awful. We already had the boarding passes printed but before proceeding to baggage drop we had to queue at the self service check-in kiosk for the baggage tags. So why do they have check-in online in first place? The queue for the baggage drop starts right next to the check-in kiosks the departure hall is very small and people were standing between the two queues. As a result many people ended up queuing in the wrong line and no-one from Blue1 did even notice what was going on. So a ten minutes operation lasted almost half an hour. On the other hand the plane was a new and shiny B717. Light coloured leather seats plenty of legroom compared to other regional airlines and friendly FA made the flight pleasant despite the clumsy start.

HEL-ARN a very full flight operated by Golden Air for Blue1 (frequent airplane substitution). Economy Extra is at the back at the plane upon boarding. Seat comfort and space is poor even for Economy. I enjoyed the cheerful service and the nice fresh meal. Flight departed and arrived with a slight delay. This is nevertheless about the level of a competitor's regular Economy Class fare but priced a bit higher; the level of space especially is totally unacceptable for anything above LCC Economy.

BLQ-HEL which they fly 2 weekly during the summer. A bit of a random route but the flight was full due to very cheap fares. I got in on an OW for $107 incl. all taxes. Flight departed about 35 minutes late and a little time was made up en route. Plane was spotless-clean with Blue1's new seats. Service was generally OK but everything is now for-purchase including soft drinks! Not sure how they can call themselves a full-service airline like that. Bologna is a disaster of an airport with the construction and there was only one agent for check-in for the entire flight and nothing for *G. Well for the price this can slide.

Flew Stockholm to Helsinki. Booked a business class flight through Eurobonus miles to find that there is in fact no business class and was in fact in premium economy. The difference between this and economy on the 40 minute hop comprises a glass of wine or a beer. All pretty disappointing. The plane was on time I guess.

ARN-HEL on the standard B717. Clean and airy cabin legroom fine for such a short hop. Coffee/tea served for free. Courteous FA's gave out a stuffed toy for the baby in our party and took extra care explaining how the infant's seatbelt worked. Bags were on the belt in minutes at HEL.

HEL-MUC on tired MD 87. Took the Internet upgrade opportunity for 4900â‚¬ to "Premium Economy". Worth it on ground service (Quick check-in Fast Track at Security) as Economy Pax had a long queue for both. The SAS Lounge in Helsinki very basic. Cabin crew friendly nice breakfast. However no English newspapers available and no comments at all to the flight from the cockpit! The price for the upgrade is ok as I had 2 rows for me alone - in contrary to the Economy cabin which was 95% full. Otherwise you are flying Low Cost with a high economy fare.

Short trip Arlanda to Helsinki. Very nice people working on board. Cold but nice meal nice experience.

HEL-CPH-HEL. HEL-CPH on Avro RJ85 on-time both ways. Clean aircraft crew and service are nothing special but seats comfortable and spacious in the 3x2 configuration. CPH-HEL on B71 food for purchase in both directions drinks free. In general this is competitive to SAS on the same sector but definitely a low-cost feel without a particularly low-cost price.

### Blue1 customer review
Premium cabin on new 717s provides access to seating in the front of the aircraft and a meal service. Value for money is okay - the fare and upgrade charge were significantly lower than for other full service airlines. If you are a Star Gold customer this is simply not worth it as you already have access to the SAS lounges. LHR-HEL breakfast was a plastic box no refinements and free water in addition to free tea/coffee provided in Economy. A very basic meal with a small portion of hot food. HEL-LHR was better with a hot meal and courteous crew keen to refill drinks. Other Star members on similar flight lengths (Turkish Aegean TAP) do a much better job. This is basic flying at the low cost end of the alliance. I have flown SAS Business/Economy Extra in the past and found service to be better the overwhelming impression is of plastic reduced cost and service stripped down to the bare minimum. The 717 is configured for 115 seats in 2x3 and not 120 seats as some have commented; there is no seatmap available anywhere. Star Gold customers are given preferential seating.

LHR-HEL-LHR on MD90. Good friendly service each way. Flight out I was expecting to pay for food but had free breakfast tea/coffee ham roll and some chocolates. Free top ups of tea and water offered later in the flight. Seats with good pitch and comfortable. On way back had to pay for food but expected.

Helsinki - London. Boarding in HEL very disorganised with our flight boarding and another arriving in the same tiny area at gate 11/12. With nearly 150 pax waiting to board at about 5 pax a minute being checked (there was just one very flustered woman checked boarding cards/visas etc) so boarding took a while. MD90 was old but ok to fly. Exit rows 24A/F have 64 inch seat pitch but are slightly narrower than normal seats. Free tea/coffee/water. Staff friendly. GBP 50 each way so great value.

Brussels-Helsinki-Brussels. Brussels-Helsinki (2000) was cancelled. Rescheduled on Brussels- Copenhagen-Helsinki with SAS. When we arrivied at Copenhagen the flight from Copenhagen to Helsinki was cancelled. We had to stay overnight. Helsinki to Brussels flight cancelled. Recheduled on Helsinki-Copenhagen-Brussels. Excuse illness pilot. I had the feeling they just cancelled the flight due to low number of passengers.

### Blue1 customer review
Oslo-Helsinki economy. Flight landed a few minutes ahead of schedule. Friendly and helpful cabin attendants. Coffee tea or water included in the fare. Bought a delicious sandwich for EUR 4.50. Comfortable flight on my favorite type of aircraft - the quiet but rare MD90. My first flight on Blue1 but hopefully not the last.

HEL-ARN and back. Both legs were RJ85's but first plane was configured 3-3 and the second 3-2. I suspect they are changing to 3-3 to pack in more seats which means I will never fly with them again. 3-3 seat config was terrible (and this was row 2 in economy extra). Seats incredibly narrow and pitch very tight. Return flight in 3-2 config was much nicer. With care you can pick the 3-2 config flights over the 3-3 flights but I wonder when will all the RJ85's be 3-3. To the terrible seats the attendants forgot to serve drinks with the meal to the first two rows on the way out I heard cans being opened behind me but nothing for us in the first two rows When they came around with just tea and coffee after the meal they could not understand why I asked "when are you serving fruit juices and other drinks".

### Blue1 customer review
CPH-HEL in economy class. I have always been a Blue1 fan but after this trip I am not so sure anymore. The flights departed and arrived on time which is probably what you can expect from an airline these days. I think what really bothered me is that it was so uncomfortable on both flights (AVRO-85). Although I have flown CPH-HEL on Blue 1 quite a few times I cannot remember that I have ever been on a plane with a tighter seat pitch than these two flights. It might be that there has been a change in aircraft! In addition I think that the flights were expensive given that I got the lowest possible rate (about 250 EUR for a return ticket all inclusive) and the service provided. Next time it will be Finnair!

### Blue1 customer review
Have flown many times with Blue1 and cabin crew very helpful and friendly. The planes are good standard with good leg room. In addition the check-in routines are fast and efficient no matter how you do it.

### Blue1 customer review
LHR-HEL return. Aircraft an ex SAS MD90. Aircraft and cabin interior was clean and tidy although a little dated seat pitch was good. Flight attendants friendly and information from the flight crew was good. Only tea coffee is free on board - food has to be purchased. Flight to HEL was on time return to LHR was one hour late. Overall no major complaints and good value for money. Usual good Scandinavian hospitality.

### Blue1 customer review
HEL-RVN-HEL MD-90. The plane was new clean and with large seats. The crew was very professional and polite. Either in Helsinki and Rovaniemi we arrived ahead of scheduled. I recommend this airline even if sometimes the fares are not really low-cost.

### Blue1 customer review
ARN-HEL-ARN in premium economy. Cold food but wine quite ok. In Rj-85 try to get row 1-4 since pitch is 32 there otherwise. As said quite ok being a commuter line. Ahead of schedule both legs.

### Blue1 customer review
HEL-CPH. RJ85/100 - clean quiet (I like these aircraft). Good crew good service. Flight crew kept us informed about our journey routing and expected time of arrival. No complaints.

### Blue1 customer review
Fly Blue1 twice a year from Stockholm Arlanda to Vassa. The other reviews are right about the plane noise it is pretty loud with a prop plane. But the fact that it was 2x1 plus the seats were blue leather and larger than normal than made up for it.

### Blue1 customer review
Already flown many times ARN-VAA and vv with Blue 1 in Biz Class (C) and I can only say to be very pleased with the service provided during this 50 mins flight.

### Blue1 customer review
Early morning Blue1 flight HEL-OUL with MD90 aircraft. They charge for everything on board. Breakfast 5 euros which would have been too much for me but sandwich with coffee would have cost the same. So bought the unhealthy bun + coffee for 250. On Finnair you get a sandwich and coffee for free even on this 1 hour route. Crew nice with one exception but they did not check that luggage was stowed away before landing. Does not give a nice impression especially after the problems that SAS and Blue1 have had with their planes lately.

### Blue1 customer review
Vaasa-Helsinki-Oslo with premium economy ticket. Check-in via SAS-website and no queuing at the airport necessary. They use Avro 85 on these routes with a very nice grey and dark blue interior. The front walls are decorated with original modern art pictures! Just 5 seats per row is much more comfortable as most other airlines using this aircraft type. The finnish domestic flight was one-class only with food for purchase. Coffee and cinnamon bun was nice for EUR 250. Easy transfer at Helsinki and second flight offered two classes with a nice snack-box for premium economy. On all flights the flight attendants were very nice and helpful. Impression was significantly better as with their parent company SAS.

### Blue1 customer review
On Sunday 1 July 2007 we arrived at Stansted to pick up the 19.55 flight to Helsinki. Apparently the incoming plane had a fault so was unable to fly but two smaller planes were to be provided. There was a considerable delay in the take off these two planes (we were in the second) and we did not arrive in Helsinki until well into the early hours of the morning with two very tired teenagers. Our return trip was booked for Friday 6 July 2007 at 18.55. To our dismay the plane detailed for our flight was faulty and our return journey would be delayed until 21.50. The plane detailed for this trip was faulty and we would have to wait for another plane to return from its previous journey. We arrived in Stansted well after midnight local time. We did appreciate the four 10euro food vouchers in Helsinki. Whilst I do appreciate that faults do occur which must of course be dealt with but I feel that two experience within six days does not fill one with a great deal of confidence! Once in the air our flights were comfortable and staff helpful.
