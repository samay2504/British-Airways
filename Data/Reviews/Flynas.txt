### "Flynas is deliberately delaying"
On Feb.28, 2023, I took Flynas flight XY258, from Istanbul to Mumbai with the stopover in Riyadh. At BOM Airport, I discovered that my bag which contained all my necessary equipment for the mountain trekking, other vital items get lost. I reported it and got PIR number. Since that moment already 2 years passed. I wrote decades of refund requests but neither Flynas nor anyone in their authority has resolved my case. Instead they were redirecting me from one department to another. I have every reason to believe that Flynas is deliberately delaying the process in order not to pay for lost luggage!

### "no compensation received"
While my luggage was under the care of FLYNAS, it got damaged (wheels broken off). I reported this issue immediately upon arrival in Jeddah and included all relevant documents and pictures. Now 5 months later and  no compensation received. Email communications gets ignored or if ever answered, then with massive delay. Already 3 times FLYNAS closed the case without any compensation for the damage done during their care.

### "contradictory to their own policy"
I made a mistake when entering my first name during booking. Despite the fact that all other information matched perfectly — same passport number, date of birth, and last name — they refused to correct the name. Their reasoning? They claimed it was a completely different person! This is absurd, as the error was clearly just in the first name. On top of that, their cancellation policy is misleading. Their terms clearly state that if you cancel, they will retain 25% of the booking amount. However, when I tried to cancel, they took 100% of the money, offering no refund. This is contradictory to their own policy.

### "Low service quality"
Flight was delayed for over an hour waiting for some passengers which affected some of our logistical arrangements made upon arriving. Limited food option for purchase offered on board. Low service quality compared to some other LCCs.

### "Will not fly them again"
For a modern airline, flynas staff still behave like government funded flag carriers of old. Check in staff was busy gossiping amongst themselves and ignored all requests. They had to ask for my visa twice, because they didn't pay attention the first time and handed it back. A seat assignment request was summarily declined, without even trying. I had paid (a lot) to check my bag so that I could keep my laptop bag overhead and have some leg-space. Even though I did not have a bigger bag, I was asked to keep my backpack under the front seat. It's a weird way to reward paying customers. Again, any protest was meant with absolute indifference. Will not fly them again.

### "the flight got closed"
Horrible level of customer facing employees in Riyadh station, today I was flying to Dubai, I came 95 minutes prior to the flight time, I approached the supervisor, he directed me to stay in the queue, the line took me 35 minutes to reach the counter, then I was surprised that the flight got closed, when I re approached the supervisor, his tune of voice and attitude was so rude, with shameful level of professionalism, I approached the station Manager their, he refused to state his name or title, and did not even listen to my complaints. I am so shocked by the quality of Flynas’s front line employees, beside losing my flight to Dubai (which is my smaller issue), I felt badly directed and unheard when I had an issue.

### "baggage got lost 11 days ago"
My baggage got lost 11 days ago, using Flynas. Several times I have tried to claim compensation, but have always been declined before the process could start. It seems like Flynas is really trying not to want to help me. Otherwise, may I ask why WhatsApp chats are being closed, within seconds, and Emails never answered?

### "unprofessional and unsatisfactory"
I traveled to Riyadh from Doha on a Flynas flight and had pre-booked extra luggage and snacks. However, I did not receive any snacks or water during the flight. Despite asking the cabin crew for assistance, I was told that my request would be fulfilled, but I did not receive anything. Additionally, the cabin crew's behavior was unprofessional and unsatisfactory.

### "never fly again with Flynas"
Not Verified |   The boarding crew to the inflight crew were rude. Although a snack was included in my ticket nothing was offered. It felt like they were doing me a favour by flying me. The crew took all the bags to put in the overhead compartment for take off which is understandable but they did not check to close the compartment. They laughed at the person seated next to me because they appeared to be a little confused. I was not allotted the seat which I had reserved and the check in crew did not even offer an explanation or apology. Just said it’s been allocates to someone else. Will never fly again with Flynas.

### "we still don't have the refund"
My husband and I bought 2 round trip tickets to go from Baghdad to Jeddah and return back on July 13, 2023. The trip was for Sep 9 to Sep 20. We reserved the hotel and got ready for the trip. Close to our trip on Aug 14, 2023 we received a message that our flight has been cancelled! So we tried to contact the airline. They said we have to choose and accept a refund option. They said we can only refund the money back when the airline goes with it. Since we paid for hotels in Saudi Arabia and it was non-refundable, we had no choice but to buy another ticket to go for our trip. So we bought other tickets. We couldn't find the same price and we bought very expensive tickets since it was very close to our trip. We couldn't get the same date we had hotel reservations for. So we got the return 2 days later and there were no cheap hotels available. So we reserved a much more expensive hotel for those 2 extra nights than what we got before. After 8 months we still don't have the refund. We wrote to KIWI and there is the history of our conversations on KIWI customer service line for the past 8 months. Today, I got a message that we will be credited on kiwi.com 501 dollars! We paid 1150 for 2 people but it seems airline are going refund us for one ticket. Why? We deserve the full refund of both tickets and also damage that we tolerated from cancellation of tickets by you. It hasn't been our intention. The cancellation has been done by the airline so airline must give us back our money in full. We need to pay for our credit card that we bought with it. So we need airline to give us back our money through our credit card not as KIWI credit. We need it ASAP to pay our credit card. We already got late payment due to buying twice the tickets for a trip. It's totally unfair what you have done to us!

### "my trip was ruined"
The only reason for booking Flynas was the opportunity to get a transit via Riyadh and explore the city before the next flight for which I paid twice the price instead of a direct flight from Dubai to Amman. It's promoted that anyone can get a Stopover visa for 96 hours in case of travelling via Saudi Arabia national airlines Saudi or Flynas. The visa had to be received right after my flight confirmation. Meanwhile, I did not receive anything. After thousands of times trying to apply for it, it was not possible. No any website is operating to apply, they never answered my call for 2,3 days. no chats, I emailed them several times , did not get ANY reply. The only time they answered was to ask my name and PNR and again disappeared. I found someone to at least get connected there in Flynas and try to at least CANCEL this sad flight. No possibility either. Giving abnormal reasonings, telling your layover is for 7 hours you can't pack your luggage, meanwhile, I don't have a luggage at all and it is MY right to ask for a visa, it is NON of their business. So it's a big scam and they admit it, which is worse. Neither that visas are free of charge. when they promote it to buy from Flynas airlines to get it for free, then you have to pay so-called administrative fee which is around 25 USD xD, but then they call it a free visa. ZERO customer support. no professional, they even told me " It does not matter what we write on a website, we just write it" So they by themselves approve that they are lying and misleading a large amount of people only to scam their money for twice more fees. They refused even to change the layover time when they have flights every hour from Dubai to Riyadh and from Riyadh to Amman. Refused ANY kind of assistance, for a refund of the ticket they told me ZERO dollars. So I have to take a flight and be stuck in the airport for many long hours because of their lack of reliability. Please don't book with this airline. I had a horrible headache because of lack of communication with them... and my trip was ruined

### "I didn't get my bag yet"
I have faced terrible baggage service from this flynas I arrived at the Riyadh domestic Terminal @ 7.15 a.m. I waited on the belt to get my luggage until 8 a.m I couldn't find my bag on the belt so informed the Baggage service they asked me to get to the international terminal to claim the bag. Once I reached the international arrival bagged service they switched me from counter to counter and asked me to cancel my ticket from Riyadh to Dubai to get my luggage. This is not my mistake to cancel my ticket. It's almost 4 hours I have been waiting. I didn't get my bag yet.

### "No customer support"
Absolutely terrible experience. No customer support whatsoever. It is extremely difficult to reach a representative (you call, they tell you to send an email, you send an email they tell you to call, you whatsapp they also tell you to call). Also, this airline does not offer a refund at all unless they cancel the flight themselves. So even if you purchase a Plus or Premium ticket, you will be charged 200 each way to cancel and can only get the remaining amount as credit to use with Flynas. I’ve never seen such consumer exploitation.

### "no one gives us a resolution"
I took Flynas for the first time, took flight from Dubai to Yerevan via Riyadh for my Eid Holidays. I reach Yerevan and wait for my luggage for 40 minutes. I go and complaint to the lost and found in Yerevan airport who do not take any written complaint and directly guide me to go and speak to the airline outside the airport. They just inform us all the luggage in the flight is at the belt and no other luggage is found, I have 4 other passengers who took the flight from Dubai via Riyadh and they also lost their luggage. We all go outside looking for Flynas office which is not there as the information desk outside at the airport informs us the airline started flying to Yerevan just a day before and ours was the second flight. We try contacting the flynas customer service but no one gives us a resolution saying we need the complaint number from the lost and found department in the airport which they did not take. The flynas representative comes at the information counter and informs us the luggage might not have been transferred from Riyadh airport in the flight and they can get it in the next flight. Now I was in Yerevan only for 2 days but had to postpone the stay because they asked us to come 2 days later to collect the luggage for which I was following up with them. No one to update us for anything. I raise a complaint to the airline customer service for compensation and just one reply from the airline asking for the complaint number of the lost and found of the airline and my contact details. I give them my contact number but no one calls. Now its been 15 days I am following up with the airline on email but no one responded and called. I notice after collecting the luggage that my luggage has been broken too.

### "the crew's lack of transparency"
Flight XY 213 experienced a delay of two hours, during which no representatives from the airline were present to communicate the underlying causes for the delay. The notice regarding the departure alteration was disseminated at 6pm, thereby dissociating the delay from any issues pertaining to the aircraft's late arrival. Evidently, the crew's lack of transparency resulted in personal discomfort and undermined my confidence in the airline. Furthermore, it is noteworthy to mention that when attempting to provide feedback via the survey, the response failed to be recorded. This occurrence not only proved highly frustrating but also fell short of acceptable standards. Overall, the combination of the delayed flight, the absence of staff communication, and the inability to register my feedback has greatly disappointed me, eroding my trust in the airline.

### "worst customer service"
They lost my luggage and I lost another flight for this. Right now I'm continuing to try to have an help from them to deliver my luggage in Switzerland but I'm receiving wrong information saying to contact other companies that don't matter (Wizz Air and Transavia). Wizz Air was the company I had to take after Flynas. Nowadays after called infinite times, sending emails, chat on all social channels i'm not receiving helps and last days all of them are disappeared closing chats when I'm asking something on their website or don't answering my emails. The worst company ever, the worst customer service I could see in my life!

### "I missed my flight"
I missed my flight due to long waiting at security check. I was travelling with family and staff denied entry. While 15 minutes were left  No refund, change in flight or compensation was offered

### "Such lack of service"
Left Cairo ok, on arrival at Riyadh at approx 7pm, once on wifi, a "reminder" email arrived telling us of a new flight number and departure time, now 11 hours away at 0600. No communication from ground staff about luggage, delay, any options to stay somewhere, nothing. At 3am, some passengers managed to raise the issue with airport manager, who spoke to the Flynas manager . He  then got off his backside, issued boarding passes to the 20 odd people stranded, and checked luggage is available to (hopefully) end up at our destination at the same time as us. Customer service at last. Such lack of service by a Saudi airline, does not reflect well on the country.

### "luggage has not come with the flight"
Not Verified | I boarded Flynas flight from Dubai to Hyderabad, IN (XY 210- DXB- RUH, XY 325- RUH- HYD) with my family. My ordeal started from the time I landed in RUH, I have booked for wheel chair for all my journey for my elder son, 4year old. My elder son is a special kid and can’t walk, no wheel chair assistance was provided by Flynas upon reaching RUH, on my second leg flight when I asked a flight attended for water I was denied that citing reason that they are busy. I have even complained to that crew member after 30 min and he just rendered an apology, but these all issues stand very small when I compare this with ordeal I met when I landed in Hyderabad on 8-12-22 at 8 am. After waiting almost 2 hours near the conveyor belt for luggage , almost all the passenger of flight XY-325 was informed that sorry your luggage has not come with the flight and it’s still in Riyadh. I am not from Hyderabad and I have planned this journey with my two little son (1 year & 4 years) and my wife for a medical reason only, my all 3 luggage has doctor reports, medicines, and all other necessary stuffs which are still lying in Riyadh. I fold my hands and request Flynas to show some courtesy and kindness and provide me my luggage asap.

### "I didn't get my luggage till now"
Not Verified |  I didn't get my luggage till now. It's been a week. Very poor service. I am trying to contact airport authorities but they are not receiving my call. Now what am I supposed do ? All my clothes and books were there in my luggage! I just had 1-2 set of clothes in my hand bags. I will not at all recommend anyone to fly through flynas. This was my worst experience till now .

### "with flynas app be careful"
Cabin service and flight time is above average. I think the problem of this airline as per previous review is customer service. Their website showed if you want to cancel and then it showed cancelation fees. That is suitable for me and when cancel the fees came to be the refund. Failed to cancel the process and I advise who want to use this airline to use third party reservation and I have no problem. Everything is clear and direct with all third parties but with flynas app be careful

### "got delayed for 2 hours"
The flight got delayed for 2 hours without any reasons. Staff are very unorganized and rude. People are waiting in lines and the flight is not open. The price is as expensive as the other flight.

### "do not recommend this airline"
Not Verified |  Our flight was delayed 20/30 minutes without any notice. The aircraft was small and there was no space, the seat very uncomfortable and it barely even reclines. The flight attendant was rude and short tempered for no reason at all. My food was disgusting, bread with mayo or cream cheese, carrots, cheeses with only a very small water bottle. You have to pay extra to drink anything else. I do not recommend this airline.

### "The food on this airline is the absolute worst"
Not Verified |  The food on this airline is the absolute worst. I purchased a sandwich and it was cream cheese on a dry, spongy flat hotdog roll I wouldn't feed an animal. The staff are sour. The plane has never left on time (and I have flown them 8 times). They also falsely advertise their holiday destinations. For Sarajevo they have a photo of Mostar. Expensive for the level they are.

### "next flight to Sarajevo is in 2 days!"
Yesterday, I’m supposed to have a flight from Jeddah (transit in Riyadh) to Sarajevo. My flight from Jeddah was delayed which initially stated for just 20 minutes (in reality for 2 hours without any announcement whatsoever) Had a bad feeling that I’m going to miss my next flight, therefore I quickly search for the officer in charge at the gate (there is barely anyone at that gate) to let them know and ask them to make sure that I’m not going to miss my next flight. The officer said he had make sure that my next flight is aware of this delay and assured me that I’m not going to miss my next flight and so I can get onboard and make it on time. Unfortunately, when I arrived in Riyadh, I was too late and other next flight to Sarajevo is in 2 days! I went to the counter and luckily they offer some compensation, however as I’m writing this review, know that I’m still waiting for my luggage and it’s been 7 hours.

### "best described as sad"
I booked FlyNas since it is the only airline offering a direct flight between Vienna and Riyadh. 5 hours is all it takes and I booked their premium class. What FlyNas delivered is best described as sad: Time of our flight moved forward by 40 minutes without notice. Check in in T3, but boarding in T1. Flight went first to Salzburg for a 50 min stop and to offload and load passengers while arguing with ground staff on missed safety issues. Seats in premium cabin are very uncomfortable and identical to Economy. Waste of money. Cabin was freezing, no blankets available. Seats recline enough for a 1 hour flight but not a 7 hour plus journey. No power sockets. First 2 sets of overhead bins on either side of the cabin are reserved and used for crew luggage. Crew could not care less where passengers, paying premium prices, store their Hand luggage. Food in its presentation, selection and quality was dismal. 1 bottle of water offered during 8 hours in the aircraft. Crew did not ask once if they could possibly be of help. No hand towels in the toilet. Of course neither screens nor wifi. The 5 hour journey started at 1000 at Vienna Airport and ended at 2000 in Riyadh.

### "I do not recommend this airline"
I do not recommend this airline to anyone. Within the span of 24 hours, the airlines managed to cancel my original flight and delay my updated flight. What a trashy service.

### "ground service is the worst"
I did online check in and they didn’t send me the boarding pass, at the airport there is no Machine to print out the boarding pass, there is no counter for people who did online check in and having only carry on bag. They want me to stay on a very long line to get the boarding pass although I did checked in online. Staff from flynas were not cooperative at all. So I went out after waiting in line and canceled my flight. I will never use flynas again, ground service is the worst.

### "where does the greed stop?"
Where does the greed stop? Booking: agent on the phone says lower price than the one I saw on the screen for booking - same flight same time. Changing the flight: deliberately made a nightmare so you can book through the staff and pay 125 SAR service fee. The customer service was on the phone while I was trying to do it myself. It would take them seconds to do it. Checking in: good experience and helpful staff Im flight service: 100g water bottle and a piece of bread with a slice of cucumber - sort of sandwich. Staff: absolutely lovely.

### "not covered by any kind of support"
Although there were 9 passengers waiting in the airport, the airline closed the registration, leaving these passengers with no support for the weekend. No available solutions, the only answer I get after two days of complete silence, I am not covered by any kind of support.

### "Really horrible customer service"
Flynas lost my bag on a flight from Jeddah to Amman a month and a half ago. I've filed many complaints, sent many emails, made countless calls, and received promises to look into it and get back to me, but I haven't heard back and haven't got any answers in a month and a half. Really horrible customer service. Avoid this airline.

### "call center kept me 30 minutes without answer"
Flynas is a low-cost carrier while the ticket price was 250 USD for a domestic flight from Riyadh to Najran (light economy). Flight was cancelled and their call center kept me 30 minutes without answer, their twitter account reply privately that yes it was cancelled because of weather (weather was calm), I asked for the next days flight and they replied that no seat was available (the online site showed me there was). I asked for the nearby airport to fly from (three hours driving), they said no seat was available while flynas.com showed there were 3 flights available.

### "no one was telling us what was going on"
Riyadh to Delhi with Flynas. Our flight was delayed one hour, after the delay we boarded the flight at 9.15 pm, we waited 3 hrs on the flight. I don't know if the problem was the weather but during the 3 hrs we were very bored, no one was telling us what was going on. We were very hungry. After three hours the cabin crew were not answering our questions with any gentleness.

### "they never returned my money"
Delhi to Cairo via Riyadh. Under these unfortunate circumstances of coronavirus, I cancelled my ticket under the cancellation policy but they never returned my money. One they ask to call their call centers but they have ghost centers because no one picks up a phone there. Further I kept on chasing them on mails, even copying there top management but no one is giving heed to it. On my scripted replies which are of no use. They say that my money is kept with them for 1 year to be used in future and if not used within that 1 year it will be confiscated. I mean that's absurd.

### "did not honor our refund"
Not Verified |  We planned to travel from Canada to Jeddah on Feb 28 and after few days travel Flynas from Jeddah to Karachi on March 8th, 2020, but Saudi government banned Umrah and refused entry on Feb 27th, hence we never started our journey from our base Toronto. Flynas did not reply any email or phone or honored our refund. So far there has been nothing from them.

### "refused to refund my money"
Istanbul to Delhi via Riyadh. I had a return flight from Delhi to Istanbul. My return flight was on 14th March 2020 and it has been canceled since the government of Saudia Arabia has stop flights to Turkey due to the recent COVID-19 outbreak. My cancellation mail arrived on 12th March 2020 from Flynas Airlines Flight Adjustment Department. According to the mail, I could call their call center to get more information. I tried to call Flynas Call Center however, their call center was not accessible because no one picked up the phone. Indeed, I mailed their customer service unit but I did not get any response. I had to book a flight at the last minute from Delhi to Istanbul. I had to fly a different airport than my previous airport because other options were way above my budget. I had an extra flight from Sabiha Gokcen Airport so that I had to rush between these airports. When I came back to my home town after a terrible journey I still did not get any response from their customer service unit. So that I called Flynas call center. When I talked to the Flynas they refused to refund my money. They informed me that they translated my ticket into a mile point and I had only one option which uses these miles on the next flight. I did not accept their rules because I knew that a refund was my legal right in this situation. I tried to explain that I was not a Saudia Arabia citizen and I did not live in Saudia Arabia so that I could not use these miles. When I requested to refund my money again they advised me to contact Flynas customer service unit. I called them and mail them but there was not any response from Flynas customer service unit. I reached their call center again and explained that Flynas customer service did not answer my emails and phone calls. This process continued three times, I mail or call their customer service unit a hundred times but there was no answer. I paid 230 SAR phone bill because of these phone calls. In summary, I was victimized by Flynas company and threatened unfairly. I have been waiting for two weeks to get any response from the customer service unit but they still ignore me.

### "Shockingly inept organisation and shockingly inept communication"
I travelled with FlyNas approximately 10 times early last year and insisted to my employer that I would never Fly with them again. 4/5 times they were late - usually between 1-4 hours. They provide almost no information to passengers about the delays and just let them sit there waiting for something to happen. Shockingly inept organisation and shockingly inept communication. Having changed employer, this year I've had to try them again. Unsurprisingly, their app still doesn’t work properly (on iPhoneX at least) forcing you to use a Web browser and take a screen shot of the ticket. I checked in online last night and came to Dubai terminal 1, thinking I’d get through emigration and use one of the sleep pods for a late morning flight. Only I was told that they didn’t accept FlyNas e-boarding cards, I had to use a normal printed one - but FlyNas counters were closed, so I had to get a taxi to a local hotel instead. This morning someone told me that’s because of the visa checks that need to be done in person - which Emirates, Saudia and Fly Dubai seem capable of doing online. It appears that FlyNas aren’t linked up to the systems to enable this online - yet they don’t feel like this is worth mentioning when you do checkin online. I’ve travelled lots, and I have no qualms in saying that FlyNas are utterly useless. A bit cheaper than most of the other airlines, but a truely awful experience.

### "Avoid this airline"
Not Verified |  Delhi to Riyadh. The worst flying experience I had. Two days before my scheduled departure, they rescheduled the flight to be over 10 hours later. Given the time change and that the flight was at 4 AM, I didn't see this until the day of. As a result of this, I was late coming back for work and had to pay top dollar for an extra night at a hotel (booking so close in). They then further said they would provide compensation both at the airport and later when I could call the customer service. In short, the flight cost me more money than the ticket of the flight itself, and I was lied to repeatedly throughout the process. Avoid this airline. If you want to go to Saudi Arabia for whatever reason, don't take this.

### "now waiting for refund"
My flight to Cairo via Riyadh from Delhi got delayed by 11 hours. However I was only intimated for the first sector a night prior. There was no reply on emails, no proper response on fb messenger from them when I kept asking them for Riyadh-Cairo flight. It was on the date of my flight when I had a callback and they said they cannot accommodate me on the connecting flight. My flight was at 3 PM and I was on phone sitting at my home at 11 AM discussing what will happen to my flight. They gave me an option to reschedule my whole flight. My flight was on 25th and the reschedule date they gave me was on 27th Dec. I had spent money on my vacation, taken leave from my office. Pathetic customer service as they only have international customer care number. People working there are equally pathetic. I will not recommend this airline to anyone. I finally cancelled my flight and now waiting for refund.

### "organised and efficient"
Riyadh to Dubai. Organised and efficient. I take this route every week. Most of the times the plane arrives before scheduled time. The only suggestion I have is to apply strict hand baggage control in Dubai Airport

### "11 hours at Riyadh Airport"
Abu Dhabi to Delhi via Riyadh. Flynas is the worst flight in the world, they  delayed my flight 8.30 hours with officially conformation of bad weather. The staff said destination weather is not due to this we are delaying our flight but in email or sms they are not mentioned the weather of destination is bad. They not provide us hotel also, I spend more than 11 hours at Riyadh Airport. This is my first and last travel for flynas.

### "told to wait 12 hours"
Dont be attracted by cheap ticket prices. My flight from Riyadh to Delhi got cancelled after they gave boarding pass. And was told to wait 12 hours for the next flight. No explanation. No accomodation, no water, no food. They hold your checked-in bags and tell you to wait at the gates for over 12 hours and they cant even guarantee whether you will get the next flight. Pay more and better book other airlines.

### "disappointing experience"
I have a flight today from Dubai to Cairo via Riyadh, the trip got delayed at least 3 times so far making the arrival time 2 hours later than the original arrival time, a so disappointing experience. Highly not recommended

### "had no issues on board"
Not Verified |  Lahore to Riyadh. Flight was on-time and had no issues on board. Flight map was bit slow but the inflight entertainment was wonderful and there was variety was movies, games, and inflight magazines to read. Aircraft was also new and staff were generous. I would recommend this airline for tourist coming and going to/from Saudi Arabia.

### "Flynas ruined my vacation"
I travelled from Abha to Dubai on connecting flight last August 9 for a supposed fun vacation. My flight was business class. Unfortunately, until now August 11, my baggage is still in Abha. Flynas ruined my vacation. This is unacceptable and their service lines are very useless. I called them several times, sent emails and text messages, but they are really very difficult to reach. In fact, went to their office in Dubai Airport personally and promised that they will send back my luggage the day after. But one day has passed still my baggage in Abha. This is the worst airline ever! If only I could turn back the hands of time I wont book with Flynas again.

### "flight being delayed hourly"
Riyadh to Dubai. They call themselves a budget airline but work out more expensive when seats, luggage and meal on flight has been selected. I am sitting at the airport in Riyadh with updates coming up showing the flight being delayed hourly. I regret having booked this airline.

### "I had a wonderful flight "
Not Verified |  Riyadh to Lahore. I had a wonderful flight with this airline. The flight was on-time and the crew were friendly. The WI-FI and connectivity were poor but the in-flight entertainment was good. The seats were very comfortable and new.

### "it’s so disappointing"
I booked a flight on 27th December 2018 from Jeddah to Kuwait to visit my family. The flight first delayed for 30 min. When I reached to the airport while waiting to check in I have been told the flight may cancel due to the lack of customer at the aircraft. Flight was at 14.30pm and it was already 16.00pm and there was no manager of supervision to guide us. Than we have been told we will fly with Jazeera and 18.10pm and they took our passports to issue the tickets and we have been told the bus will take us to the north terminal. While we are waiting we have been told none of he flights are available for today and they were trying to send us to the hotel. There was no clarification on when we will fly. Even for next day or whatever! There was an agent and he said don’t talk to me and complain to the call center! So irresponsible I had to book another flight and mean time I have been told I can refund! After waiting over the hearing their cheap on going advertising for 25 min. I manage to talk to agent and he said there was no delay with the flight and place took of to Kuwait on time! They had no idea what was happening at the airport. He gave a agent name to talk to him and he said he has the solution for you .Pay a bit more and never use this is airline as it’s so disappointing!

### "very poor customer service"
My flight Jeddah to Riyadh departure time is 17:00, we reached the airport 1.5hrs earlier with our online boarding ready and been told that it is canceled. For no valid reason they put us on the flight at 19:00. We received a msg only 10 min before boarding that we should contact them, and still showing in airport screen (on time) And the new time was also delayed until 20:00 with Zero respect to passengers time and very poor customer service by staff in land.

### "a terrible airline"
Flynas is a terrible airline. Always late and never any explanation by cabin crew. A no frills airline with ageing fleet at very high prices. Over $300 single from Dubai to Riyadh. Stay clear of this airline.

### "do my best not to recommend"
Jeddah to Riyadh. They simply announced that the flight is 5 hours delay and no other option than wait. Without suggesting putting us on another flight or other company or even lunch or snack voucher or anything like respectable companies do! First and last experience with these people and would do my best not to recommend.

### Flynas customer review
I wanted to travel from Islamabad to Madina for Umrah with my family. Obviously they offer cheaper option so I googled it to find out whether they accept umrah passengers? The response to qurry was in affirmative so I booked from the website using credit card. Nowhere during the process I was alerted or warned about anything. As I reached the airport before departure, I was told at check in counter that I was not permitted to travel on Umra visa through flynas. I returned home to process modification or refund. The website does not offer any option to launch complaint or cancel the booking. I contacted customer servive at Saudi Arabia where I was told that Flynas does not offer refund as per policy however, they will offer me credit for subsequent travel on flynas for which I should call next morning. I called customer service centre again next morning. I was told since I had booked on website in light category so airline does not offer any change or cancellation and my money of almost $1100 stands wasted. I was also told that cancellation is offered only to the passengers travelling by business and first class. It is shocking that people travelling by economy (light or premium) class are otherwise underpreviliged and even they are made to suffer by skimming their money. So an extremely miserable and tortourous experience with the airline. It does not warn u before booking your journey. Lures you with cheaper offers and subsequently grabs your money. Completely shocked once customer service centre told me that we have grabbed your money and have no way out for you. Never choose this flight.

### "staff however were very unprofessional"
My flight was canceled on arrival at the airport and I understand these things happen. The staff however were very unprofessional and don't care about their customers. Just a (sit down there and wait for the 9.30 flight). No apologies or explanation, nothing. The 9.30 flight was now jam packed and I was told to move from my seat I booked and asked why. I was told to get off the plane if I do not move. I will move if they give me a proper answer but this was ridiculous. I will definitely not fly these airlines again.

### "way they answer is so rude"
Jeddah to Riyadh. My flight was supposed to be 1200 but I'm still in the terminal. Because of delay. What makes me upset are that they never made an announcement about this delay and they removed the flight info from the electronic screen so we have no idea when the adjusted departure time. Because of no announcement and no info, all of us have to proceed to the other gate to ask Flynas ground staff and the way they answer me is so rude.

### "reasonably friendly and courteous"
Flew Riyadh to Dammam with Flynas. On time departure and good service from online check-in to boarding. The A320 aircraft was fairly new, clean and ticked all the boxes for a one hour domestic flight. Crew seemed reasonably friendly and courteous. A good low cost airline with reasonable prices.

### "diverted due to a bad storm"
The flight from Jeddah to Riyadh was diverted to Buraidah due to a bad storm and weather. My complaint is that the stewardesses refused to offer coffee or tea even though I offered to pay as per the Nas Air policy. They became very rude. Many frustrated customers were complaining, but the staff were not interested.

### "its no longer cheap"
Riyadh to Jeddah. One of the worst airlines, last week my wife and two daughters traveled by Flynas, They charged for meals but they didn't supply even a glass of water during the flight. When my wife check with crew of cabin they no apologize but said today their company couldn't supply passengers meal and soon will refund the money (meals). However, until now no refund. They attract people by saying the slogan of Cheap flight, when it comes to domestic its no longer cheap when compare with Saudi Arabian Airlines. Terrible service.

### "never recommend this airline"
Dubai to Jeddah with Flynas. Seats are okay, and the staff is okay. We had a stroller / baby cart. When we got out of the plane, they didn't take out the stroller. It also did not come out with the rest of our luggage. We had to wait good 45 minutes for Flynas representative to get to his desk as he was on a "10 minute break"? Finally, he informed us that the stroller is in the other terminal. There is no way for them to bring the stroller to us, so we had to go to the other terminal by a taxi and get the stroller ourselves. This cost us 2 hours and; 100 Riyal extra as the taxi driver had to wait for an hour for us to finally find our stroller. Why couldn't they bring the stroller out when we were getting out of the plane or even send it through the luggage area. Would never recommend this airline.

### "has all you need"
Jeddah to Riyadh with Flynas, a low-cost airline based in Saudi Arabia. It has all you need from such an airline. Spacious seats, clean aircraft and the flights were on time.

### Flynas customer review
Both flights were delayed. The gates were never shown on the screens. The baggage took almost as long as the flight now, in fact I am weiting this and the baggage still has not shown up. The drive from Riyadh to Abha is about 8 hours. This flight took me over 9 hours now..

### Flynas customer review
LGW-JED-RUH on April 26 2014. Business. FlyNas is the low cost carrier of Saudi Arabia and recently added intercontinental services and enhanced cabins to its range of domestic and regional routes. I flew from London Gatwick to Jeddah with a connecting flight to Riyadh. The aircraft had been full on arrival at London but the passenger load was very light returning to Jeddah. As a result the level of service was terrific with a high ratio of crew to customers on board a very clean and smart A330-200. Business passengers can use Fast Track at Gatwick and have access to the Aspire Lounge. The seats are angled lie flat and very comfortable for a six hour sector with large pillows provided. The on board entertainment was supplemented by iPads with new release movies pre-loaded. Fares on FlyNas are lower than the full service flag carriers when booked well in advance and this was reflected in the meals which were average served in economy size foil trays with none of the fuss or flourishes of the five star Gulf airlines. This was fine for the price paid. Saudi carriers do not serve alcohol but there was a good range of soft drinks. An afternoon tea was also served not long before landing. The Saudi experience apart from the customary reading and blessing at the beginning of the flight did not really begin until King Abdulaziz Airport because the aircraft and entire crew is Portuguese hired from HiFly. They worked very effectively in both English and Arabic and were hard-working and friendly. The connecting FlyNas flight to Riyadh was a very typical low-cost service on board an A321 fairly tight for space full to the brim with purchases available from the trolley. Seating is allocated and there is the option to buy extra leg room or a larger seat at the front of the cabin but flights between the main cities in Saudi Arabia are not longer than a couple of hours so a standard seat was fine.

RUH-JED. Check in at Riyadh Airport was ok staff helpful boarding pass says a certain gate however the screen stated another gate. Flight delayed almost 45 minutes but were not informed screen was still showing on time. Plane was ok looked a bit tired crew seemed helpful. Seats looked old I don't like the leather seats but it seems a Saudi way of expressing luxury. It is a pay for service airline so didn't expect much space between rows is narrow and I felt the seat itself is smaller than regular airlines was not really comfortable but for a short flight was ok. Upon arriving in Jeddah couldn't find the belt for luggage however we finally found it but with a different airline logo and different destination.

### Flynas customer review
RUH-JED return. Check in a breeze no queues staff efficient but a few smiles would not go astray. Boarding quick new A320 with 29-30" pitch. Interior clean new looking pay for service was good value if not limited. Flight on time and bags on the belt within 5-10 minutes. Both flights full and cheep and cheerful at only 390 riyal about 70 euro - cannot go wrong with this service especially with no hidden extras (bags go free no issue with hand luggage etc). One negative was the safety on landing but I think it s just a middle east thing - why do passengers get up and start taking bags etc from the bins when the pilot has not turned of the seat belt sign at the stand? Cabin crew do not ask people to sit down.

### Flynas customer review
RUH-JED. Another good flight with Nas Air. The flight left on time was not too crowded and an emergency-exit seat was definitely appreciated. The Arab and Eastern European cabin crew made an effort to seat us comfortably serve promptly collect rubbish and smile throughout. While the plane was old (it seemed to be a second-hand ex-Spanish Airbus) it didn't have the tired feeling of many other discount carriers.

### Flynas customer review
RUH-JED. Flight cancelled before hand but only told when arrived at the airport at 5am for 6.45am departure. Promised seats on 10am flight but refused to check us in when we tried at 9am as there were "no seats" customer service policy seems to be to lie and then go off duty and let someone else sort it out! Rude and clearly incompetent not sure they know how to run an airline.

### Flynas customer review
JED-RUH with one of the new Saudi discount carriers Nas Air. I had booked a super-cheap airfare for about USD $30; unfortunately I did not read the fine print and after the cab driver taking me to the wrong terminal at King Abdul Aziz Airport in Jeddah I ended up being five minutes late for the 45 minute boarding time... and Nas has a strict 'on-time' policy. I was a bit annoyed that five minutes seemed to make the difference between my getting the flight and not but I guess I agree with the rule in general. As a result I ended up having to return to my hotel in Jeddah for another night and booking another flight the next day. This one wasn't so cheap - but still quite reasonable at about USD $90. When I finally did fly I thought the airline was good for the price. The older Airbus 320 needed a new fit-out; the seats were tatty and overall the cabin looked quite old. The seat pitch was very bad but I have experienced that on other discount carriers like Jet2 and easyJet so I expect that. The stewardesses seemed to take forever to get to me with their drinks and snacks cart (all for purchase) but then seemed to whizz past a whole few rows without even offering us anything to eat or drink! Very odd. Luckily I caught them on the way back. The stewardesses otherwise were reasonably friendly I have flown Saudia before and thought that Nas Air attendants were nicer. The level of English of one of them wasn't so good but I noticed that they were Arabic speakers - which I don't think is the case with Saudia. All in all I thought that the airline was okay - I would fly them again for the price they are charging.
