### "worst experience of my life"
The worst experience of my life. Flight delayed by over 8 hours, no information, no one notified me ahead of time. Iâ€™ve been in the airport since 6 am. No compensation. Airline staff incredibly rude and unhelpful. Never, ever, ever use it.

### "The worst experience ever"
I have booked a ticket on 05.07 for flight WZ-383, and due to feeling unwell, I could not join this trip. So, I tried before the flight to change the ticket online for another date, but their web-site was not working on this option plus it was hanging when it came to the point of making change, I have tried as well to call the hot line, but no one would respond, just continuous waiting. Finally they considered me as no-show customer and I lost my ticket totally. When I wrote to them in their feedback form on the web-site - they answered me firstly that I was no show, and after on 27.07 they replied that I need to send a written letter on their address via normal post, while I never expected that in 21 century any company would do so, since long time all respectful airlines and business companies are replying by e-mail officially. I guess they just hope that written letter would not reach them - so, they can close the case without giving any feedback. The worst experience ever. Never recommend to anyone.

### "Convenient time charter flight"
Istanbul to Moscow. Convenient time charter flight from Istanbul to Moscow. Low airfare, within the size of hand luggage, water and inflight magazine on board for everyone.
