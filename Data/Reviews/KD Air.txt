### "been 5 months and counting"
Everything seemed totally fine when booking two return flight tickets from Vancouver South to Tofino for our 3-night stay (tickets worth 698 CAD). Then it all went wrong, KD Air called two days before scheduled departure (flight #214 2018/07/30), telling me that the flight to Tofino is cancelled due to unscheduled maintenance. I had to book the flight with other airline for double the cost. KD Air assured me that the flight from Tofino to Vancouver South will still happen. After the first night in Tofino, KD Air called me again and told me that the flight (#215 2018/08/02) back to Vancouver is cancelled due to unscheduled maintenance. Again, I had to book the trip back with another airline for double the cost! As I don't live in Canada, KD Air's customer service assured me that I will get back money back! It has been 5 months and counting (since July 2018), I still don't have my money and KD Air decided to stop responding to my emails.
