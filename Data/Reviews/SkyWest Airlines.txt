### "forced rebook by airline"
Not Verified |  Book flight for Thanksgiving. Left Nov. 26, 2024 one way to Fresno. Flight was nice and comfortable no complications. Book flight back from Reno, Nevada December 1, 2024 at 7am direct flight to Portland only to have canceled and reschedule for over booking. Unable rescheduled on Sunday to fly so forced rebook by airline for Monday 12/2/2024. No base seat available so force to buy a higher price ticket or be reschedule for Tuesday 12/3/2024. Refunded $25 dollar from Sunday then force to pay $55 dollar Monday or be scheduled. There more but I book flight through Alaska and flight was Via Skywest. So their more even late leave airport on Monday and ground stewardess take 20 minute to play with another passenger tablet before being able board plain. Flight suppose be 720 am left Reno after 820 am.

### "took great care of daughter"
Not Verified | The folks at Delta and Sky West were great. They took great care of daughter and her room mate on their way home for spring break. They made a special trip to get our bags at the Elko Airport.

### "wasn't even close to fitting my carry on"
Not Verified |   They had a measurement in the terminal that shows if your carry on can fit. My carry on fit just fine. But when I got to the plane, the overhead bin wasn't even close to fitting my carry on.

### "She is a perfect representative"
Our flight attendant, Julie, was very friendly, attending to the needs of not only first class but coach, too. She remembered drinks and kept our thirst quenched. She was always busy and helpful. Always giving a beautiful smile to each customer. She is a perfect representative for Sky West and should be be commended for a job well done.

### "delayed because of mechanical issues"
Both times delayed because of mechanical issues, very frustrating. From now on direct flights only! I don't understand how the same airline can have mechanical issues before take off so often?

### "fishing rod as an extra item"
Portland to Seattle. Their policy counted a fishing rod as an extra item requiring me to check a bag through my final destination jeapordizing the contents of in the bag. The lady scanning tickets was very rude and challenged the validity of my final destination. I would never book a flight with Sky West!

### "big thank you to staff"
A big thank you to staff of Skywest Airlines at St. George Airport and on flight DL7393 Wednesday, May 18, 2016. My age related reduced mobility and endurance makes travel more difficult than in past years and I had dreaded this flight. However, Skywest staff made it one of the easiest flights I have had in years of travel. The male attendant in the boarding lounge saw my cane and luggage and without my asking came to me and asked if I would like help which I accepted gratefully. On boarding the female flight attendant also immediately took my luggage and placed it for me. On deplaning a male staff member offered to handle my luggage and proceeded to get me through the arrival lounge and to a wheel chair where I was taken all the way to the outside taxi stand. Given that the Skywest lounge at SLC airport is far removed from the baggage claim and taxi stand, this was more than just a convenience. I was able to arrive home without being exhausted. Kudos to the above mentioned Skywest staff - a team of champions.

### SkyWest Airlines customer review
The plane was a CRJ operated by Skywest. I was warmly greeted at the door by a very nice FA. Service was excellent. The seating on the CRJ is 2-2 rather than 3-3 on the larger planes. The plane was very comfortable and quiet. No entertainment system due to the short flight.

### SkyWest Airlines customer review
I am a regular flyer but only had my first experience with SkyWest last week on a flight from Milwaukee to LaGuardia. Unfortunately I have to say it was the worst experience I have had with an airline. I booked the flight via Delta who did not include baggage in the ticket price and would not allow me to pay for this immediately - I had to wait until it was time to check in. Very inconvenient. They then proceeded to rescheduled the time of the flight about four times. As a result I had to call them to reschedule to a later flight which resulted in my missing several hours of my NYC vacation. The later flight took off as scheduled but was very old and had the smallest seats I have ever seen and I am a small person. Safety is clearly not a priority for this airline as the flight attendants did not explain what to do in case of an emergency and by checking the safety card I discovered there were no life vests or life rafts on board. In the event of us landing on water we were to use the seat cushions to stay afloat! Considering this flight crossed Lake Michigan and Lake Erie and flew over the Atlantic before landing at LaGuardia I find it baffling that they would even consider not having life vests on board.

LAX to SMF on 12-10-14. Small regional jet economy but in an exit row with more than adequate legroom. Uneventful flight decent airline would fly Skywest again.

### SkyWest Airlines customer review
SMF to SLC - premium economy on Delta's regional carrier Skywest. In my experience seats on Skywest are more comfortable than the ones on Delta's larger aircraft. However the recline is minimal. Pleasant flight on time flight no food for purchase.

### SkyWest Airlines customer review
SLC to OKC. My spouse gave me her first class (upgrade) boarding pass. I can't comment on value for money because this was a free ticket. However first class was disappointing no food served or available for purchase on a flight that boarded at 1:20pm. (we had a one-hour layover). The seats were wider than those in EC and with more legroom. I'd fly Skywest again but would not pay for a first class ticket. Other than the lack of food the flight was pleasant the FAs attentive and courteous.

### SkyWest Airlines customer review
SkyWest does not honor American Express/Delta free baggage deals. They are the only carrier in and out of some destinations like West Yellowstone. As a result even if you get your free checked bag from your original departure location/Delta flight you won't get it on the way home. The SkyWest ticket counter employee at West Yellowstone actually thought it was funny. She laughed at me when I complained. This was a "Delta" flight operated by SkyWest.

### SkyWest Airlines customer review
Traveled from Kalgoorlie to Perth. Aircraft used was a Fokker 100. The check-in was extremely quick. As always the plane was tidy and well kept the flight attendants are always polite and tidy. Skywest seats have more space then rival airlines on this route and are comfortable too. The flight included breakfast and unlike the rival airlines on this route you are given more then one option to choose from and a variety of drinks to select. I would recommend Skywest.

### SkyWest Airlines customer review
Perth-Kalgoorlie same-day return. F50 outward F100 return. Quick and efficient check-in. Aircraft ageing but clean and well-kept inside and out. Seats reasonably comfortable for tall people. Ground and cabin staff friendly cheerful helpful and very professional. Was promised breakfast but only a snack provided. Ticket prices quite expensive even considering late booking.

### SkyWest Airlines customer review
Perth-Busselton on Fokker 50. Terminal was new clean large and attractive. Quick check-in. I lost my boarding pass but was re-assured it didn't matter (which was a great relief)! Cabin crew were easy going and polite. Aircraft spotless. Small snack (rice crackers) and water were served. Very quick flight and comfortable but forgot to go to the toilet and didn't have the chance to get up as it was so quick! Arrived early with a smooth landing. Great information given by pilots (altitude weather) fare was $104.

### SkyWest Airlines customer review
Busselton-Perth on F50. Check-in great and nice baggage allowance. Fare was $92. Delayed landing at Busselton but made up time in air. No food - was a disappointment. Only water served. Cabin crew didn't smile and made little eye contact. Comfortable flight. Toilets were pretty average. Pilot made great clear announcements. Aircraft in great condition the cabin had no mess and a nice magazine to read.

### SkyWest Airlines customer review
PER-KFE-PER Fokker F100. Alliance charter F100 on the way out to Cloudbreak. Cabin very old and worn out. Not surprising for mining charter flights. Breakfast not bad usual cold breakfast/cereal affair. Flight time nearly 2 hrs. No IFE or magazine. Return 5pm and F100 again. SkyWest aircraft this time. Meal was a very small snack but we landed at 7.15pm so dinner would have been more appropriate. Magazine provided but no IFE. Crew polite and easy going. Drinks were good and plentiful no alcohol unless purchased. Advice - don't sit in the last three rows as they aren't "window" seats as they are blocked by the engines and the noise is terrible.

### SkyWest Airlines customer review
LAX to San Diego having flown into LAX with Delta and this was the connecting flight. Timetable for this flight allows 50 minutes but in reality it is nearer 20-25 minutes. Nice little Canadair jet very bright and clean inside. Left on time and arrived early. Two cabin staff seemed to be playing good cop bad cop. No drinks offered because it seems the flight is not long enough. Its a great little flight that does not climb too high and so you get a splendid view of Los Angeles. Once the plane was parked up we had to walk along the apron to the terminal building. Slightly longer wait then I had expected for so few passengers to get my luggage from the carousel.

### SkyWest Airlines customer review
MEL-PER Via Kalgoorlie. XR22 Fokker 100. Due to not being able to locate the crew the flight was delayed by 1 hr at Melbourne. Due to strong winds between Melbourne and Kalgoorlie the flight was diverted to Adelaide to pick up extra fuel. The 5h20m flight turned out to be nearly 7 hrs. These tickets were extremely cheaper than the major airlines. Check-in was simple at Melbourne airport and the flight was extremely good. The Flight Attendants were down-to-earth and worked well for the full flight including the stops. They brought around food many times during the flight. Apart from this unexpected stop i would highly recommend Skywest for the Mel-Per route.

### SkyWest Airlines customer review
Fokker 50 from Perth to Geraldton and Geraldton to Perth. Great service by cabin crew food provided was great. The disadvantage of Skywest flight right now is its delay. All my flights were delayed but mainly due to the small terminal of the airport. In addition the flights on this flight is very expensive due to lack of competition.

### SkyWest Airlines customer review
SLC-FCA-SLC Delta connection branded CRJ200. Both directions crew was informative and friendly. Aircraft well maintained and clean. I can't complain about the service we received in 1hr 30min flight. Check in people at SLC are very busy with constant Skywest-Delta Connection flights leaving but efficient.

### SkyWest Airlines customer review
Perth to Albany F50 early morning flight. Check-in well staffed so no waiting. Aircraft in good condition for its age and seat pitch generous. Friendly crew and a reasonable cooked breakfast served on this 1 hour flight. Departed and arrived ahead of schedule. Excellent service - my only gripe was the fare $201 is a lot for a 400km flight. More than half the seats were empty - they would surely fill more seats if they kept the price down.

### SkyWest Airlines customer review
Darwin-Perth via Kununurra and Broome. Light food and beverage served on each leg by friendly and hard-working cabin crew. Aircraft interior trim was a bit worn but the seating was the most generous and comfortable I can remember in an economy cabin anywhere ever - this is how it should be! All up the flight took nearly 6 hours and we had to stay on the plane during stops but I would have had an expensive extra night in Darwin had I flown with anyone else. I got a very good fare booking well in advance but fares shot up to over $800 a week before - perhaps they should review this pricing policy because the plane was less than half full on 2 of the sectors.

### SkyWest Airlines customer review
YEG-SFO return economy. We were placed in the exit row of the CRJ-700 on both flights. I'm not sure if this was pure luck or because of our FF memberships. Consequently we found the leg room excellent. The flight and cabin crew were good. The only beefs we had with SkyWest was that they charged for checking in our bag. We were not made aware of this charge before checking in.

### SkyWest Airlines customer review
BUR-SFO. I flew First Class on a new CRJ-700 with excellent service. Flight crew professional and friendly. New seats on the CRJ very comfortable. More so than some of the larger domestic aircraft. OJ or water offered prior to take off from the flight attendant. Pillow and fleece blanket supplied. This flight exceeded my expectations for a regional flight. Returning was equally as good.

### SkyWest Airlines customer review
PER-DRW-KNX-PER. All flights were fantastic heaps of legroom and complimentary meals with tea coffee or juice. Soft drink and beer available for a small charge. Complimentary newspapers on all seats too. The F100's seem to be aging a bit. Not bad at all for a local airline reminded of Ansett service.

### SkyWest Airlines customer review
This was great for a low cost 55 min flight. Flew Perth-Albany and return. Check-in was fast large baggage allowance and check-in women was attentive. Boarding call clear and we were boarded within 10min from the call. 2 flight attendants for a small Fokker 50 (prop plane) great seats with good leg room and recline. Served a meal of great food. On the way back I was surprised that there was no security check at all! What great trust the airline/airport (Skywest is the only airline to fly to Albany) has in there passengers! On the way back they served a chicken sandwich with carrot cake and cookies! Only problem I had was that it was in plastic containers.

### SkyWest Airlines customer review
Perth to Karratha on an F100. Friendly staff from the ground staff through to the cabin crew on-board. Aircraft showing it's age but the cabin service was efficient and friendly. Hot breakfast served with tea and coffee all included in the very cheap fare of $159. Skywest has lots of positives going for it and whilst these flights are aimed mainly at the mining companies they will continue to pick up other business with their good product.

### SkyWest Airlines customer review
DEN-MLI (United branded flight). Had to walk outside to board plane which is fine. However left 15 minutes late since 3 other planes boarding from same gate at same time and people getting on wrong planes. CRJ-200 extremely outdated interior and air conditioning inoperable. FA told us to close shades for entire flight to keep plane from heating up which helped. Cabin crew pleasant. While I would say worst flight I have been on subtle nuances made up for it somewhat.

### SkyWest Airlines customer review
PER-LEA return. Perth quick and efficient check-in and no queues at security screening. Boarding by walking across tarmac. Flying north I was travelling on a F-100 jet down they use a F-50 turboprop plane. Seat pitch is impressing. Catering okay and free of charge except if you'd like to drink beer or wine. FA attentive friendly. For the (high) fare you pay you get pretty good service. Check-in in Leamonth took ages due to a printer problem and there was no security screening in service which I found rather remarkable.

### SkyWest Airlines customer review
In Modesto CA (a city of about 200000) Skywest is the only airline that serves our airport with multiple daily flights to both SFO and LAX (LAX service unfortunately to end soon). Realizing that one can't realistically expect a comfy Boeing or Airbus jet on these short thin routes Skywest does at least get you there - although anyone beginning his or her trip with Skywest or any regional should try to depart as early as possible as these planes easily get backlogged during their multi-segment days and are given last priority to land and big hub airports. I have flown Skywest many times to both airports recently. Unfortunately they use the dreaded Embraer Brasilia turboprop on those routes which is very cramped loud seats don't recline and the "lav" (it's a bit of a stretch to call it that) is nothing but a mid-sized compartment that even I at only 5'10" can't stand up in. There is no running water. The sole F/A must actually crouch under the galley counter to allow you into the lavatory. All of us mid-sized Western city residents will breathe a huge sigh of relief when Skywest finally gets rid of all these dreadful beat-up planes and replaces them with regional jets!

### SkyWest Airlines customer review
RDM-SLC-DEN. Not real happy with Skywest/Delta Connection on this route. At RDM took agent a full 15 minutes to check me in she continually was having to refer to "how to" manuals to guide her through the process. Late incoming flight causing late departure was not told upon checkin nor was this reflected on monitors in the gate area. Later an announcement made that those with tight connections in SLC should come to make new connections however my ticket showed RDM-SLC-DEN as a simple stop in SLC same flight number to DEN single boarding pass. You guessed it it was one of those flights that shows up as a one-stop but is actually a different plane (I knew airlines did this on intl connections but didn't think that the regionals did it too.) Skywest ground staff in SLC were very shaky: three seeming trainees one slightly-more knowledgable one who had to guide all of them through the various situations they were trying to rebook.

### SkyWest Airlines customer review
Perth to Esperance return with SkyWest and most impressed. The breakfast going was real food fresh and tasty. On the return mid morning flight back to Perth the muffin was tasted just out of the oven. Nice coffee not bitter at all. Attendants were efficient and friendly. Legroom the best of any domestic airline in Oz.

### SkyWest Airlines customer review
Perth to Darwin via Broome. Fokker 100 was clean quiet and comfortable. The cabin crew were polite friendly and helpful. The food among the best airline food I have tasted. There was a large selection of alcoholic and non alcoholic drinks available. Overall I had a highly enjoyable experience and would not hesitate to recommend flying with Skywest in Western Australia!

### SkyWest Airlines customer review
Perth to Exmouth. Very friendly crew and a good flight with the captain indulging in an overfly of Exmouth bay for a spot of whale watching!! Hot meal was supplied on the outward trip which was better than some other Carriers travelled. Highly recommended.

### SkyWest Airlines customer review
I've flown SkyWest on the SFO-EUG route many times (under United ticket and livery). They used to fly mainline United (737) on this route but have resorted to more frequent flights (5 a day) on this route with SkyWest. The CRJ 200s are spacious for their size and the FA is usually very friendly and attentive. I wouldn't want to fly more than 1.5 hrs on the CRJ 200 since leg room leaves a lot to be desired.

### SkyWest Airlines customer review
Travelled skywest while on honeymoon from Oakland to Salt Lake City in codesharing Delta. It was a CRJ flight for about 30 people -only 1 flight attendant on board. First time travelling in such a flight as in Asia smallest planes are B737/A320. Flight is comfortable flight steward very friendly made 2 rounds of drinks.

### SkyWest Airlines customer review
Had a flight with Skywest from Perth to Broome it was one of the best flights I have ever had. Flight attendants were excellent food services was very nice with the full tray that included very fresh food. The FA’s came around with trays of drinks all the time and the nice touch was when we boarded at Broome after take off the came around with ice hand tows as it was very hot and humid at broom. What a 5 star service and I love there Fokker 100 aircraft very neat with all leather seats and the most leg room of any airline in Australia.

### SkyWest Airlines customer review
I recently flew Skywest as a Delta Connection from HLN to SLC. Although I don't like the level of the windows in the CRJ (you have to bend your neck down halfway to see out) the flight was very good and comfortable. It's amazing the room those little planes have. It was a very full flight. The F/A was a delight - very conscientious and attentive. The flight crew were good too. We got there way ahead of schedule. I was very impressed with Skywest.

### SkyWest Airlines customer review
The Flight Attendants were very professional efficient warm always smiling and extremely attentive. I felt like a guest rather than just one of their customers. I highly recommend flying with them if you come to visit Western Australia!

### SkyWest Airlines customer review
There is also a SkyWest Airlines in Australia that has a fleet of Fokker 50's and Fokker 100's. They also have frequent flyer agreements with Qantas.
