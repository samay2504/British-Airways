### "satisfied for what I paid"
A low-cost airline, and they enforce bag weights and sizes and number of bags very closely. Despite that if you buy early its a good value for travel in and around Kazakhstan. Purchase bags early as they charge a lot at airport. My flight however was fine, arrived on time with no issues. Overall satisfied for what I paid.

### "issues with Russian cards will be resolved"
We bought tickets for the flight from Omsk to Almaty at 13 March. Then the airline cancelled all flights from Russia. The return of money have been requested but the company informed us that the money bought with the card issued in Russia will be done only the technical issues with Russian cards will be resolved. No other way to return money have been offered. Since the technical issues (blocking of Russian VISA and MasterCard cards) is not expected in nearest future.

### "treated rudely at check in"
Almaty to Shimkent. Was treated rudely at check in. The first time we flew it was very cheap, and this time we flew it was almost the same price as air Astana On one flight we had to wait (Taras to Almaty). Three hours because they lost a passenger and even get off and go back on the plane.

### "I will use it again"
Almaty to Taraz with FlyArystan. Super cheap ticket, nice and fast service. No delays no problems. Only one thing to be improved, check in at Taraz airport. Staff were very slow. For sure I will use it again. Please open Almaty Dzhezkazgan, as there are no direct flights.

### "exceeded my expectations"
Almaty to Karaganda. Purchasing a ticket 11 days before the flight from Almaty to Karaganda was super fast and cheap. Airplane looks new and clean. Service exceeded my expectations. Cabin seat was quite comfortable. Menu of snacks, tea/coffee, and other bevarages is affordable. One unusual thing is while checking in, they sort flyers based on their seat numbers to make it easier to board a plane.

### "cheaper than the Talgo train"
Nur-Sultan to Almaty return. I bought the tickets on the company's website. Initially I planned to travel with just a hand baggage, but the day before the flight, I managed to add a baggage on the website for 2500 tg. The flights were excellent. Flight attendants sold buy onboard drinks and snacks. Arrival was just on time. The ticket price turned out to be cheaper even than the Talgo train.

### "lack of credit card payment support"
Astana to Almaty. Staff was polite and the plane seemed new. I hope it will continue to work like this. After long stagnation in Kazakhstan aviation industry, this was like fresh air, even not considering the price of the flight. Only inconvenience was lack of credit card payment support, only cash support.
