### "flight itself was actually quite good"
Not Verified |  On April 19, I flew with Discover Airlines from Frankfurt to Orlando. Overall, the flight itself was a positive experience — the food was good, the crew was attentive, and there was enough focus on passenger comfort. The in-flight entertainment selection wasn’t exactly a "Top 100" collection, more like a solid "Top 75" — not outstanding, but definitely good enough for a long-haul flight. Unfortunately, everything leading up to the flight was far from smooth. Online check-in was frustrating and confusing. We had pre-selected seats via the Lufthansa website, but these didn’t match what was shown on the Discover Airlines platform, where we had to check in. As a result, our family wasn’t seated together. I called for assistance, but was told that seat selection had already closed. Luckily, during the final step of online check-in, I was able to pay extra for new seats — and we managed to get the last ones available that were still grouped together. When i filled a complaint about this i was replied that we would get our money back within 14 days for this issue. The airport experience in Frankfurt was also disappointing. Most of the staff seemed unfriendly and unhelpful. Our printed boarding passes didn’t work with the self-service baggage drop, so we had to queue at the counter. Once we were at the desk, we were treated as if we were an inconvenience simply for needing assistance. After checking in the first suitcase, we stayed at the counter, only to be met with confusion from the staff member — apparently surprised that we had more bags. We were traveling as a family of four and had four suitcases, but only with reluctance did the staff member help us check them all in. Boarding the plane was poorly organized as well. Thankfully, since we were traveling with children, we were pulled aside and given priority boarding. That part went very well and was much appreciated. I decided to write this review because I’ve read a lot of negative feedback about Discover Airlines — and while I can relate to some of it, I also want to point out that the flight experience itself was actually quite good, especially considering the price. Would I fly with Discover Airlines again? Probably not. But I also wouldn’t completely rule them out.

### “hardly anything to buy”
Not Verified | One small cup of water for a 5-hour flight and additional water could only be purchased. No meals on board either. Well, okay, but there was hardly anything to buy except for a couple of sandwiches.

### "extremely bad service"
Not Verified |  I guess no service might be even better than extremely bad service. if you fly with Discover, here is my advice. Bring your own drinks along, and that applies in particular to water. You are offered 0.1 litre complementary water in a cup. If you ask for more, you don't get anything. You may purchase water for an incredible price. And go to the toilet before the flight. Even for a 3.5 hours flight, you are considered as disturbing factor to the flight crew if you go in the toilet. I paid for a full flexible ticket and I knew, I don't get much service. But to get this unmotivated crew was a little shock for me. I will fly them again, to return to my home town, But then: Never.

### "the flight was unpleasant"
First of all, they rejected the entrance while boarding to several passengers because of a wrong boarding group even though it was the last passengers of the previous group and these passengers were asked to go back to the cue. They didn’t allow to put my hand luggage into the airplane because it’s too large. I had to take all my electronics and carry them with me. Seats are uncomfortable and the flight was unpleasant.

### "boarding was a mess"
One of the most rude and unprofessional ground and cabin crew. The gate agent screamed at me because I had handed her the boarding pass from my previous flight by mistake; boarding was a mess with the gate being changed three times. The aircraft was parked away from the gate, so we had to use buses to get to the aircraft, which was fine but they made us wait for several minutes inside the bus after bringing us away from the terminal saying that the aircraft wasn't ready. Cabin crew ignored calls toward the later part of the flight and closed service more than 40 minutes before the end of the flight, refusing to serve water.

### “for the price, definitely not worth it”
It all started when we checked in our luggage. We arrived at the Discover counter and only saw the Business Class check-in desks. Since we were flying Business, we headed there. A staff member standing in front told us we had to go around the corner to check in. That seemed possible, so we went there, but it turned out to be the Economy check-in. So, we returned and told the staff member that we needed to check in here since we were flying Business. His rude response: “You could have said that.” Well, it’s not our job to inform him—it’s his job to ask what class we’re flying. It didn’t get better from there. The check-in agent seemed completely uninterested and, at the end, simply stated a number while staring at us when we didn’t immediately understand what it meant. We had to figure out for ourselves that he was referring to the gate. The only positive experience was the lounge (which was a Lufthansa lounge, not a Discover one). Then came boarding. After scanning our tickets, we walked toward the aircraft, but the entrance to Business Class was still blocked because they weren’t ready. If they’re not ready, boarding shouldn’t start! There were passengers with mobility issues who had to stand and wait until they finally opened the section. The cabin crew was okay, but the welcome Prosecco was undrinkable. The salmon trout tataki appetizer was absolutely disgusting—it smelled awful. The plane itself was old, and the seats were extremely uncomfortable. If you’re tall or overweight, good luck. Breakfast was fine, but I’m still waiting for my apple juice. The lavatories weren’t great either—not at the level of other airlines. Overall, it was okay, but for the price, definitely not worth it. I can’t recommend it.

### “Not looking forward to the return flight”
Not Verified | Where to start - you pay extra to pick a seat - they reassign you to a very much now equal seat. I do not pay extra to sit in the middle! The Premium Economy seats are EXACTLY the same size as Economy - just more leg room, larger eating tray. I booked via LH and had never heard of this airline, seems like AC is using it instead of AC planes. This leads to the next issue. At FRA things were delayed, fine. Then they said, no we cancel - go from Hall C to Hall B transfer desk for rebooting. So everyone hussles out of this secure area to B. LH at B refuse to have anything to do with this - Discovery problem, go to the check-in counters. But most booked via LH, I never picked Discovery! We hussle to the check-in, outside of security, only to be told - flight is back on! Go back through various layers of security back to the gate. I will apply for a refund, not hopeful on that actually happening. Not looking forward to the return flight - also booked with LH, but operated by Discovery.

### "ignored by customer service"
Not Verified |  Our luggage never arrived at our destination during our flight from Gdańsk to Tenerife on February 8, 2025. Since then, we have been completely ignored by customer service, which Provides contradictory information about the location of our baggage. Fails to handle complaints properly, violating passengers’ rights. Refuses to connect us with a supervisor and prevents us from filing formal complaints against staff. Only offers a partial refund for essential purchases, despite being legally obligated under the Montreal Convention (Article 22) to cover the full cost. After 5 days, our third bag is still missing, and when one of our suitcases was finally returned, we discovered valuable items missing.

### "they rejected my claim"
Not Verified | 1st flight after Hurricane Milton and was told that there would be no food on the flight. Sent me an email and then gave us a letter at check-in to go to a restaurant in the airport prior to flight and then submit receipt which I duly did to the website they specified. 4 emails and 4 times they rejected my claim stating that I had flown in the class I had paid for. They were not going to give me anything ! Not sure what to do next as matter of principal the deliberately mislead passengers

### "No regular drinking water"
No regular drinking water in the flight. When we request for plain water, they ask "what do you mean? , the only water they have sparkling water and you cannot get regular water even if you want to buy. Horrible food, our family had very tough time with this segment of the journey.

### "We were extremely disappointed"
Not Verified |  My husband and I were planning on spending Christmas with family in Paris. Flight from Tampa was 2h late. We had a 9h flight from Tampa to Frankfurt. Missed our connection to Paris by a few minutes. The security at Frankfurt was slow and not friendly and nothing was set up so we could catch our connection though we were told the plane would be held on. We had received an email with 2 options of other connections to Paris, one was 1h later and the other was 2h later than original time. That would have been fine. However we went to Customer Service Lufthansa and we were told we were booked for a flight in 9h! We were only given a $15 coupon to eat in Frankfurt airport as compensation. And we were not upgraded. We spent Christmas Eve stuck in an airport for 9h and got in Paris at 10pm instead of 1pm originally. We were awake for 36h when flying to Paris takes 8 to 9 hours. We were extremely disappointed.

### "Ground service the worst"
Not Verified |  We took Premium Economy because Business Class was already full. Cabin crew was always very polite & helpful. Food lets say "ok", screen small, films were not updated for many many years, small ear plugs (headphones) we got had the worst quality I ever had- but only ones which work at their system. But the flight was not the worst. What was the worst experience was the pre boarding at Frankfurt. I guess it was operated by a subcompany of Discover Airline (not same uniforms) -- this was a group of impolite, rude, arrogant, provocative people who use their power. Several friends of us, and also family members reported us this before, but we could not believe this. Ground service the worst we had anywhere.

### "just pure disaster"
So disappointed! I was using Orlando-Vienna way many years and when it was mostly in Austrian airlines company it was great flight. Last 2 years Discover company was just pure disaster. My husband always missed his connection in Frankfurt - that were late from Orlando always around 2-3 hours. Same my flight in July. But still we were giving them chance. Till today. They cancelled our booking even we had already in our hands printed tickets and sended us as couple totally different ways back to Orlando. Who saved us was Austrian - even they had no idea and nobody let them know why we were booked for another flight when flight in their system was not cancelled. We spent 4 hours to dealing today with this mess. Never again Discover. Rather back to the combination United - Austrian! Opposite of Discover, Austrian always tried to help me and do all the best. Even they are in same group.

### "lack of knowledge and professionalism"
Prior to our flight in August 2024, I diligently followed procedures, including confirming multiple times with Lufthansa’s hotline about transporting a registered air pistol. Discover’s staff demonstrated a shocking lack of knowledge and professionalism, creating unnecessary obstacles that escalated into an outright nightmare. On the day of departure, I was subjected to conflicting instructions, with employees seemingly improvising rules on the spot. Their refusal to check in the item, despite federal police clearance, led to hours of confusion, delays, and emotional distress for my wife and me. Ultimately, we were denied boarding our flight. The lack of empathy or assistance from the airline’s staff was appalling. I was left scrambling to resolve the issue myself while my wife was reduced to tears. Adding insult to injury, we were forced to pay out of pocket for two additional nights of accommodation, transportation, and a new weapon case to comply with their arbitrary requirements. Even after being rebooked, Discover continued to mishandle our case. On the rebooked flight, I was initially barred from boarding due to an “empty entry” in their system, an error that neither I nor the staff could understand. My wife refused to board without me, and it was only after yet another confrontation that we were allowed to proceed. When I submitted a claim for reimbursement of these additional expenses, Discover Airline refused, demanding receipts for every expense despite having bank statements that clearly demonstrate the costs incurred. Moreover, they failed to conduct the thorough investigation I had requested into their numerous failings. In summary, Discover Airline’s handling of this situation demonstrated incompetence, negligence, and a complete disregard for customer well-being. Their staff’s behavior was unprofessional at best and malicious at worst.

### “cabin crew apathetic and dismissive”
This is the worst airline with the worst customer service I’ve ever flown. On the outgoing flight there was a four hour delay, on the return flight there was a two hour delay and the airline didn’t even give you a free drink as compensation or to say sorry. Their seats are really small and don’t accommodate a normal person. They’re very uncomfortable. Their cabin crew was equally apathetic and dismissive. The food and beverage service on board was terrible. I would rather spend more money than to fly this airline ever again. I spent $1626 on the round trip ticket with a very poor airline.

### "Terrible experience with lost luggage"
Terrible experience with lost luggage. My bag was left in Frankfurt instead of being brought to Tampa. Despite assurances, the wrong luggage was delivered to the wrong location. Customer service marked my claim as "closed" even though my bag was never delivered. Extremely disappointed.

### "will never fly with them again"
By far the worst airline service I have ever had. I booked with Air Canada, but the flight is with Discover. I was quoted $185 to fly with two bikes, but when I got to the counter, I was told $50 per bike... great I thought, as it was cheaper. Once I had passed over my credit card, the agent tried to get me so sign a hand written agreement for the Visa transaction, but the number on the paper looked oddly like a 7 instead of a 1 .. once I enquired the attendant informed me that her original quote of $50 each bike ($100 total) was incorrect and the new price was $750 for both bikes for one way! Agent would not give me back my credit card until I signed the paper. I signed it that I did not agree with the transaction. Once at the gate, my wife, who had just been cleared 30 mins earlier that her carry on luggage was no problem, was now told that she had to check her carry on for $250, when my wife politely said that a discover employee had said the carry on was fine 30 mins earlier, she was threatened by the emplyee that she would be kicked off the flight if my wife didn't make it fit in the carry on tester (which it did)? On the flight, our upgraded seats were not available, but they still charged us for the upgrade? what is wrong with this airline? We will never fly with them again.

### “very friendly staff”
Not Verified | Flown from Frankfurt, everything on time, you are well informed via email. Nice modern plane, very friendly staff. Good offer of movies, food was also fine.

### "checked luggage did not make it"
Not Verified |  My flight was fine. But my checked luggage did not make it to my destination, despite having checked it in at least 2 hours before my flight from Berlin. After repeated calls, and twice submitting an "escalation report" online, my bag was delivered by Fedex from Dallas (my destination was Philadelphia) 18 days after my flight. Discover never even contacted me about this; I just got a notice from Fedex about the upcoming package delivery. The online baggage tracking showed conflicting information for the first 3 days after my arrival and then stopped updating; for more than 2 weeks it showed they were still waiting on arrival of my bag to the airport. When I called Discover, the rep was always kind but the only thing they could do was tell me to submit another report online. I am unlikely to ever use this airline again.

### "One of the best breakfasts"
Excellent staff they called themselves charming and they really were. One of the best breakfasts I ever had on a flight, boarding was on time and seats were comfortable

### "I’d class this airline with Ryanair"
Not Verified | Flight was for our honeymoon, we wake up to find out flight had been postponed to the next day so ruined our first night plans in Naimbia. Had to book not only a hotel at Frankfurt but an additional one in Namibia as landed so late it’s too dangerous to drive at night. So 1 hotel we could not refund and two additional bookings! Followed by this we then asked if we could be upgraded and said it was our honeymoon and answer was ask at gate. Then we asked at gate and not possible to upgrade only if we paid €275 per person to premium or €800 for business class. Both too expensive but they were very kind and gave us window seats. Business lounges were closed not open till later and the other just closed. No point saying honeymoon as no one cares! Gate changed 2 times also causing some confusion. All in all not how I imagined a honeymoon flight I’d class this airline with Ryanair - quality and service is the same.

### “awaiting refund for necessary expenses”
Not Verified | Booked through Lufthansa for London-Orlando return. Heathrow - Frankfurt by Lufthansa. Frankfurt - Orlando by Discover and return by United Airlines via Washington. Problems started in Frankfurt by staff allowing everyone into departure lounge then having to eject them all to check boarding passes and re-enter. However flight was reasonably comfortable, flight staff were attentive and in-flight meals passable (bit mean with alcoholic beverages unless paid for). On arrival at Orlando we were informed that our baggage, 3 items, were still in Frankfurt! As bag tags were clearly marked “RUSH” and there was a 2 hour transfer window this should not have happened. Customer service staff told us to purchase whatever required and had already raised a claim form for us. Still not very impressed as only had what we were wearing to travel. Luggage turned up 36 hours later delivered to our hotel at 4.30 a.m. Trying to chase up whether luggage was en-route via supplied phone numbers was abysmal. No response at all from Airport service desk despite leaving many call back requests. U.S based customer service blocked my number after 1st call when we were trying to ascertain whether luggage was actually coming on next flight or whether we need to purchase more clothing. After several blocked calls, used another phone and got straight through to find that luggage was now with delivery agent who would take 24hrs to get it to us but if I had called earlier we could have collected from the airport ourselves. Agent could/would not understand that we had been calling for most of the day on numbers they supplied! Return flight by United Airlines via Washington was not the best travel experience but miles better than Discover. And United have a baggage feature on their app which shows where your luggage is and whether loaded or not. We booked through Lufthansa expecting their level of service which unfortunately failed. I will not use them again. At time of writing this review we are still awaiting a refund for necessary expenses. Despite several emails requesting information on status of claim we have had no response. This seems to be in common with other reviews. Avoid discovering how bad Discover Airlines are at resolving their problems.

### "flight was postponed to the next day"
I flew from Frankurt to Las Vegas and back. The price in economy is acceptable, premium economy does not offer relevant benefits but is much more expensive. The planes are old, not very comfortable. In-flight WiFI was not working. On the flight back, we were stuck in the plane the airport for five hours, because the plane was to heavy to take off. In the end, the flight was postponed to the next day. My problem with the airline is, that they are not willing to redeem the full additional cost that the delay caused. They are also not reachable by phone or willing to call me to discuss the issue.

### "That's why they abuse passengers"
Not Verified | On August 17th, they changed the flight time from 6:40 pm to 9:20 pm, we got on the aircraft at around 9:10 pm. We spent 2 hours inside the aircraft to take off, just giving ourselves a glass of water. We took off at around 11:20 pm towards Munich, but, since Munich airport was closed, we had to stop in Zagreb to refuel, as there was not enough fuel to reach Nuremberg, being in this airport and inside the aircraft (1 hour). Already in Nuremberg, there were 3 buses to take passengers to Munich, another 2:30 hour journey. We arrived in Munich around 5:30 am. (I say again, just with a glass of water). This company talks about passengers' rights, but it's what they care least about. For this company, only passengers have duties, because if there is a passenger who arrives late, they will certainly not be left waiting for them. That's why they abuse passengers. | No passado dia 17 /08, alteram a hora do voo das 18:40h, para as 21:20h, entramos na aeronave cerca das 21:10h. Estivemos 2h dentro da aeronave, para levantar voo, apenas nos dando um copo de água. Levantamos voo por volta das 23:20h em direcção a Munique, mas, uma vez que o aeroporto de Munique se encontrava encerrado, tivemos que fazer uma paragem em Zagreb para abastecer, uma vez que não tinha combustível suficiente para chegar a Nuremberga, estando neste aeroporto e dentro da aeronave (1 hora). Já em Nuremberga, estavam 3 autocarros para levar os passageiros para Munique, mais 2:30h de viagem. Chegamos a Munique por volta das 5:30h. (digo mais uma vez, apenas com um copo de água). Esta companhia, fala dos direitos dos passageiros, mas é o que eles menos ligam. Para esta companhia, apenas os passageiros têm deveres, porque caso haja algum passageiro que chegue atrasado, concerteza que não iram ficar à espera do mesmo. É por isso que fazem é abusam dos passageiros.

### "Scarce and unedible food"
Not Verified |  Old cabin, very small room and terrible service from the attendants. Scarce and unedible food + no hot beverages. Is an instant coffee expensive to offer after a 1000€ ticket? They cancelled the return flight the day before making me lose all the other flights connection I had.

### "as bad as a Delta flight"
Not Verified |   I am on a Discover flight now. I booked due to its affiliation with Lufthansa. If you are looking for the same level of travel and service, forget it. All parts of the organization from baggage checkin through gate checkin was inept. Multiple staff for single customer who could not help when a flight was changed. The entire Discover business process appeared in disarray. The only redeeming factor was the flight crew who were the only Discover professionals I met today. This was as bad as a Delta flight. Dont be fooled by the Lufthansa ownership.

### "highly recommended"
A slightly different review, not a horror story like most. I flew from Windhoek to Frankfurt in Premium Economy as the price differential with Economy was minimal and I was carrying 2 suitcases, which were included in the price, and therefore I saved money as I did not have to pay the astronomical fee for a second one. Check in was a breeze. Priority check in meant did not have to stand in the short line. The lady handed me the boarding pass for my connecting flight from Frankfurt as well. Boarding was well organized, the staff made sure that the "gate lice" boarded with their group and not earlier. As the boarding is done by stairs indications were given regarding which stairs to use (front or back) depending on seat row number. Seat very nice, same for the blanket pillow and amenity kit. The headphones are not that good (not to say crappy) and I could not use mine with the two prongs, that was a minus, but hey! Staff was very friendly and helpful, making sure we got fed and watered in an efficient manner. Food quality was good and the sparkling wine made the trip shorter. A great trip, highly recommended.

### "Disappointed with the business class"
Not Verified |   Disappointed with the business class, was really looking forward to it as it was my first time. The outward was ok but the return was not what I was expecting. Seating very narrow. It was more or less a better economy seating arrangement with more leg room. Anyhow one should have expectations. Disappointment for a long haul flight

### "Definitely too expensive"
Nothing comfortable, inedible food, old airplane. Definitely too expensive for what it was. Will never fly with this disaster again.

### “Avoid ruining your travel experience”
I booked a flight through Lufthansa for my brother and sister to travel with me to Santorini. I tried to check in online, but it wasn't working, so I had to go to the airport counter. At the airport, I went to the Discover Airlines self-check-in machine, as my flight was operated by them, and it gave me an error. The staff at Discover Airlines directed me to the Lufthansa counter. The Lufthansa attendant attempted to check us in but also failed and sent me back to Discover Airlines. At the Discover Airlines counter, the assistant tried to generate my siblings' boarding passes but faced issues. After involving a supervisor and a 20-minute wait, another supervisor managed to resolve the problem. They then hurriedly told us to run as we were late, despite the delays being their fault. We suspect the system crash was due to purchasing my siblings' tickets with my credit card, which should have been an easy issue to resolve. After a lot of stress, we barely made it to the plane on time for takeoff. Now, I'm sitting on a super hot plane waiting for departure, and we've been told we have to wait another 20 minutes in the sun because around 50 bags are missing. I can't believe my poor siblings have to fly back to Frankfurt with this airline. I wish I could rate it a 0. If you have ANY other option, choose it. Avoid ruining your travel experience with this airline's incompetence.

### “unacceptable customer service”
On 5/3/24 my husband and I took a direct flight with Discover airlines (a subsidiary of Lufthansa) from Las Vegas to Frankfurt Germany. We arrived only to find out that  the entire cargo of luggage for all the passengers was left off the plane, none of the passengers received their luggage. Who does this?? Then we have to literally provide coordinates to the airline missing luggage department because we had Airtags in our luggage so they could locate our luggage in the Las Vegas terminal where discover airlines left it. Discover airlines took a full week before we got our luggage. We submitted a claim and it’s been over a month with several calls to follow up and no response, this is unacceptable customer service.

### “spend more with a reputable Airline”
Not Verified | I flew from Split to Frankfurt via business class. The business class in just like economy, there is no difference, exactly the same type of economy seat! On the flight back, I missed the boarding as the gates got changed around and by the time I found the gate it was closed. Then they lost my bag, which was bad enough. I still don't have it back, and the customer service that you have to deal with in trying to find it, of begin compensation is like nothing you will have ever experienced before! Wrong numbers, emails that no-one answers, forms to fill out that no one replies to. They thought they found my bag and sent me some other poor persons bag to Split airport! A friend of mine's Aunt travelled with her friend on Discover a few Months ago and both of their bag's were lost too. They still haven't found them or received any compensation. Please heed this message, and spend a bit more on a ticket with a reputable Airline.

### "never fly this airline again"
Not Verified |   I was traveling with my spouse and two teenagers. We paid for extra legroom. We found out when we checked in at the airport that we lost our extra legroom seats (my spouse next to me and our kids behind us.). They stuck us in a row of 4 with no extra legroom. Their reason: the plane had changed. The lady at the desk couldn’t give us a refund nor would she give us an earlier boarding so we could make sure to have overhead bin space that we were originally planning on having. My spouse called the number on the card the lady gave us to ask for a refund because there is no customer service available at the Orlando airport. When he asked why he was not notified of the change, he was told he should have noticed the change when he checked us in… which we did at the airport. So, neat. They said we “should” have our refund in 7-10 days. We will never fly this airline again.

### "said that I did not have a visa"
My daughter and I were supposed to fly to Istanbul. But I was not allowed to do this, because Discover Airlines said that I did not have a visa to visit this country with my Kazakh passport. Since our stay was supposed to be 45 days. They said that I could only stay in Turkey for 30 days without a visa with my Kazakh passport and discover airlines didn't let me board my flight When we called the hotline, they told us that these rules are dictated by the Turkish Embassy. Today we called the Turkish embassy and they told us that the visa-free period for citizens of Kazakhstan to stay in Turkey is 90 days. We waited on the Lufthansa hotline to reschedule our tickets for 2 hours.

### "very disappointed with the quality"
Not Verified |   Having just completed our trip to Egypt where we flew Premium Economy on the leg between Calgary and Frankfurt we wanted to share a number of observations. Our flights were originally booked through Air Canada. Several months after the bookings we were informed Air Canada had turned the route over to Lufthansa, who then pushed the flights onto Discover Airlines. We were very disappointed with the quality of the flight experience given we had paid top dollar for Premium Economy seats on Air Canada flights. On both the Calgary Frankfurt flight and Frankfurt Calgary flight the size of the seat and the leg room was less than available on other carriers’ premium economy seat offerings. The Premium Economy section was nothing more than a flimsy screen that separated this section from the Economy section of the aircraft. There was no meaningful separation between Premium Economy and Economy on the flight. Discover staff in Calgary organized the boarding of our flight in an efficient manner, However, the gate experience in Frankfurt was abysmal. A call was put out asking families with small children and family members who needed special support to board to come forward to board. Once this group was onboard there was not attempt to organize the balance of the boarding by groups. Without leadership from the gate staff, the balance of passengers simply pushed forward to where boarding passes were checked. Once on board the crew did their best to provide a reasonable level of service. We were very surprised when we informed if someone wanted a drink that included liquor, one had to buy the liquor. The quality of the meals did not meet the standard provided by other carriers either. The meals were quite spicy, the second meal on the return flight to Calgary was not appropriate given it was early morning for the passengers. The movie offerings were dated. There were a few new movies but for the most part the selection included movies that had been produced years ago. It is very questionable what the value of Premium Economy is on a Discover Airline flight.

### "a big disappointment"
On both flight they missed to deliver our baby trolley at the airplane/gate even if its tagged. Dull personnel on board. We asked if its possible to eat later on the flight and they said yes, but then it was a problem to deliver food. Ticket were bought as Lufthansa so was a big disappointment to have this third class airline handling us. Will not use their services again.

### "customer service is just horrible"
Not Verified |   Our flight was cancelled and we were rebooked for the next day. No problem there. Our claim for compensation was accepted. Now 2 months later and 4 excuses later about transfer issues no money has been received and their customer service is just horrible. Do not fly with them!

### “Poor service”
Not Verified |  Service is so bad، Poor service, flight attendants very bad, services not professional at all plus no respect and not smiling. Food and service its just ok.

### "Worst flight service ever"
Not Verified | Worst flight service ever! Do not pay more for seats with extra legroom. Without notice they hang baby beds over your seat and the mothers seat. You basically travel with another persons baby in your lap! This gives more room for your toes but not your legs. And then the staff argues with you when you try to change to empty seats instead of apologising and finding new seats for you. staff is incredibly loud during the night flight. Never had other flight staff laugh and talk loud like that when lights are turned off. when my husband got sick on the plane and used the sick bag, and he couldn’t bring it to the bathroom as people were in the aisle already to get off the plane, they told him to put the back with his sick into the pocket in the seat. Needless to say we complaint to the airline. Hardly even got a sorry and of course refused to give us a recompense for the seats. We will avoid this airline from now on and can only advice everyone to spend a 100€ or £ more to fly with an airline with better customer service. The flight really soured our first day!

### "won’t see me again in a hurry"
While I was flying economy, this is never an excuse for indifferent service nor offering. After a 2 hour delay leaving Calgary, shortly befor landing at Frankfurt, we were served a meal. This consisted of a drink, tea coffee or juice, a small yoghurt and a dismal ice cold wrap. After an eleven hour flight, I thought the ice cold wrap was inappropriate for a meal after such a long flight. When I raised this with the cabin crew, they too were indifferent. Suffice it to say Discover airlines won’t see me again in a hurry.

### "my worst flying experience"
I purchased my tickets through United Airlines, not understanding that I would be doomed to fly Discover. This is a common practice between airlines, but discover seems to have no way to communicate with United. For example, United always includes a checked bag with their cross Atlantic flights. It was included in this one too. When I was leaving Frankfurt, the gentleman couldn't find any indication that I was allowed a checked bag. I showed him the email indicating that my first checked bag was free. After speaking with a supervisor, he waived the fee. Also, using the UA flight number and reservation code, I had no possible way to select seats or upgrade my seats until I got to the airport. Ok the way out, they didn't have any upgrades available. My seat ended up having less leg room than a US domestic flight. As a 6'3" gentlemen, I typically look for upgrades when possible, but if not, it isn't the end of the world. But with Discover, my knees were pressed hard into the seat in front of me. The only relief was to put my right leg into the aisle where it would get slammed hard by the cart every hour or two. My left leg was left jammed into the seat in front of me and I felt actual pain for days from it. For the return flight back to Frankfurt (today), I experienced the same problem when checking in. They couldn't find my checked bag reservation. I explained the situation and showed her the email like I did in Frankfurt. The email said: "check in your first bag for free". She indicated that she couldn't accept that and I would have to contact United to get a refund. Their fee for one checked bag? A whopping $70 or €65. To avoid having to experience leg pain again, I requested an upgrade to premium economy, thinking that would get me a checked bag for free. She said I could upgrade for $300, but it still wouldn't include a bag. After a bit of back and forth, I was able to convince her to waive the check bag fee if I took the upgrade. Following this, I had to wait 20 minutes in the service line to pay for the upgrade. She had to call someone to process it because the system wouldn't allow it. My assumption is that this is a product of no communication between Discover and United. Again. Eventually, I was able to pay and go through security, which was significantly easier than the check in process. Folks, when your airline treats you worse than the US TSA, there's a big problem. The flight attendant were somewhat nice on the flight here with the exception of a bruise from the drink cart. People, do not fly this airline, pay any amount more money to fly literally any other airline. This was my worst flying experience.

### “Cabin attendants friendly and professional”
This is a charter airline and part of Lufthansa group. They use the same seats as Austrian Airlines but in different colors. Seat comfort isn't very high but luckily the flight was short. They've a nice wifi cloud system with movies, music, TV shows etc. Food is buy on board, not even water is given for free. Cabin attendants were friendly and professional. The captain kept us well informed about the flight. Recommend.

### Discover Airlines customer review
My flight with Discover airlines was schedule for Feb 24, 2024 at 6:25pm from Tampa-Frankfurt. Exactly 5 hours before the flight I was sent an email with the message: Cancellation of your flight 4Y65 on 24 February from Tampa to Frankfurt. I wasn't given any notice and automatically booked on a United flight that I never requested and didn't fit my schedule. Not to mention I lost my connection from Germany to Romania. I called Discover Airlines multiple times and they just hang upon you, they don't care. I was nice on the phone just looking for help from them and they are the worst customer service. I will be filing a claim with them.

### "flight attendants were amazing"
I am very satisfied with the whole journey, and that comes from a person who has extreme fear of flying. Yes, the food is not something special and the seats are not so big, but it is not like I will live there. It is a good company to fly for a vacation and the best part is staff, the flight attendants were amazing, there was one that came the whole time from business class just to make sure that I'm feeling okay, I traveled with my kid and there was enough food and water and everything. Before take off in Punta Cana there was a small problem with toilets and we needed to wait inside the plane and the stuff brought us water and everything that we needed. In the future I will fly again with them. The only thing that I didn't like was not enough ground stuff at the airport.

### "Worst flying experience ever"
Worst flying experience ever. The first flight was 5 hours and we didn’t get a glass of water. The plane had a delay, but I had connection flight that they are responsible to adjust even if this situation and the connection flight was supposed to be 6h and 55 m. Well after 21 h hours I finally got to my final destination and in the next flight there was not space for everyone so some of the passengers got home even later next day. In the plane I asked if I can have a glass of water, and I was told I have to pay it.

### "waiting weeks with no reply"
Not Verified |  The flights were fine and no delays. The problem is my baggage was missing for two months and when it finally arrived it was broken into and multiple items was stolen. I made a claim with the airline and have been waiting weeks with no reply they do a great job at hiding phone numbers to not be able to call them and chase it absolutely ridiculous. I will never fly again.

### “Horrible customer service”
Horrible customer service. I asked to upgrade my ticket to the business class, the lady said there is not enough meals. 30 minutes later she booked 2 seats to someone else. Will never fly with them again.

### "customer service was disappointing"
The customer service was disappointing, with extended queues due to understaffing and strict regulations regarding luggage size and weight. Despite the evident frustration, two men at separate counters stood out for their politeness. Flight delays were significant, and passengers were required to stand in line for an hour without boarding the aircraft. I plan to steer clear of this airline in the future.

### "Food was dreadful"
Not nearly Premium Economy. Boarding was a mad scrum where we were supposed to have priority. The lady on the microphone at the boarding gate was totally intelligible with her mumbling. The PE cabin was not independent, just an extension of Economy. The seat was a standard Premium Economy seat, nothing special. The IFE was poor with a very small selection to choose from - I watched my own Netflix the whole journey. Food was dreadful and I barely touched it. Nobody asked me why. Was this the same awful food that was served in Economy? Surely not as you have paid for elevated dining. I was served 2 small plastic glasses of wine, under 100ml in each! I was not offered any other alcoholic drink. I flew a sister airline (Swiss) in business recently - Zurich to Mauritius - and it too had dreadful, uneaten food. I flew BA in Premium Economy recently and what a total difference. Really very enjoyable and a whole different story. Never again Swiss or Discover. You have an awful lot to learn as to how to treat your business and Premium Economy passengers.

### "thought we were booking a Lufthansa flight"
Run from this airline. We thought we were booking a Lufthansa flight only to discover that we were flying on Lufthansa's down market, no frills vacation carrier' that is only half a step above a charter flight. Pathetic food, little service, poorly maintained aircraft, and the worst possible gates (set at the far end of both FRA and MCO with the other low cost airlines). The only thing worse than the flight is a tie between trying to get a straight answer from customer service and the surliest check-in agent, we are certain, in the industry.

### "a huge thank you to Dylan"
Not Verified |  I just wanted to say a huge thank you to Dylan (from US customer service), who helped me to rebook the flight for my mom from Frankfurt to Tampa on 12/04/2023. Not only he is very helpful and professional but also a kind person.

### "conditions of serving were far below average"
Flew from Las Vegas to Frankfurt with another 2 friends and it was one of the worst flights. I have booked my flight in a belief that I will get at least a standard Lufthansa experience. When booking, the flight was marked as a Lufthansa operated by Discover. I had no experience with Discover, but had a good experience with Lufthansa, so I expected to get at least basic Lufthansa standard. I am even in a Lufthansa Miles club so I expected at least fair conditions. As a first IMHO the A330-300 is not a go to aircraft for a transatlantic flight. At least not in the configuration used. The seat pitch and size, toilets and other items are designed for flights up to 5 hours not 10+. There was no possibility to regulate the AC on a passenger level, so I had to sit 10 hours wrapped in a blanket with cold ac blowing directly on my neck. Now I am experiencing a serious spinal cold and need to seek a medical care. The hygienic standard of the toilets was below average. These were dirty, smelly and some lacked even a paper wipes only a few hours after take off. Not talking about the smell that entered the cabin several times Food is subject to a personal taste. But the conditions of serving were far below average. There was just not enough space to eat normally. And after finishing the meal it took at least 1.5 hour for cabin crew to pick up the trays and empty food containers. You have to pay extra for even a simple alcoholic drink like beer or wine. That is something I never experienced on a much more shorter flights in any airline. All others offer you a free drink even in a 3 hour flight, not a 10 hour haul. When we landed in Frankfurt the terminal was not operating and we had to wait quite a long time to get out of the plane. Left the plane thru back side doors and stairs and bus to the terminal. This was also quite inconvenient because the bus took us directly to the other end of terminal and we had to run all the way thru to catch our connecting flight. I filed a claim on the Discover Airlines website shortly after landing and asked for a compensation, but I got only apologies with no solution. This was my first and probably also the last experience with this airline.

### "My claim for compensation was denied"
Ten minutes before the flight was scheduled to take off, Discover Airlines gate personnel made an announcement that due to a mechanical issue, our flight was cancelled. Upon inquiry with customer service personnel, I was re-booked on a different flight, which departed the following day. After my trip, I applied to Discover Airlines for compensation, due to the short-notice cancellation of the flight and long delay in re-booking me on another flight. My claim for compensation was denied, citing "extraordinary circumstances. The flight cancellation caused me big problems with my rental car and hotel reservations, in addition to personal inconvenience. Discovery Airlines owes me financial compensation and I will never forget the callous manner in which they casually dismissed the problems they caused when they suddenly cancelled my flight.

### "pick another airline and airport"
Left Tampa Sept 29 to FRA on a direct flight with 5 Hrs + delay. Zero communication from Discover Airline, a Lufthansa company. Rude, incompetent, unprofessional, arrogant ground personnel at TPA airport. Zero help with wheelchair service. If you are mobility challenged or wheelchair bound, pick another airline and airport. On return flight lost all luggage and again Zero communication from airline personnel. In flight service OK.

### “contact with the airline is very difficult”
Not Verified | For our trip to Namibia we unfortunately flew with Eurowings Discover (now Discover Airlines). The flight from Frankfurt to Windhoek was delayed by over 10 hours, forcing us to spend the first night of our holiday in Frankfurt. We were informed of the delay 1 hour before check-in. Coming back from Windhoek to Frankfurt there was complete chaos. All Discover Airlines flights out of Windhoek were cancelled for three days (6 flights in total), with hundreds of passengers scrambling to find any flight out. We managed to fly three days later via Ethiopian airlines, since we no longer trusted that Discover Airlines would actually get us out of the country. Any contact with the airline is very difficult. It is only via web-forms, where you get generic information-free replies after waiting for weeks. No one had even read my question. The one flight with them we managed to take in premium economy was unfortunately not good. The seats were standard for premium economy, and the food was inedible. Both my son and myself skipped the dinner, just smelling it was already unpleasant. If I could give zero out of 10 I would. Do yourself a favour. If you can in any way avoid it, do not fly with Discover Airlines!

### "worse than many cheap airlines"
I have just flown Lufthansa from Frankfurt to Orlando and back (September 2023). The ticket has been purchased through the LH Website, giving an impression that I was buying Lufthansa services. Discover Airlines is the same or even worse than many cheap airlines flying crammed passengers for summer vacation on short distances. I was flying the Economy, but that was not the economy class of regular airlines. I am 170 cm tall and that turned out to be too tall to fit in Lufthansa seats on Discovery Airline Economy Class flight. Service on board - non existent; not in a way that it should be for the price I have paid.
