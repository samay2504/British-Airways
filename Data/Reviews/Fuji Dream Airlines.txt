### "Very comfortable flight"
Very comfortable flight! This was my first time to fly with FA Fuji Dream Airlines and I was impressed. Check-in was efficient, departure was punctual and the cabin was very comfortable and stylish. Best of all, customer service was so friendly, both the check-in staff at Matsumoto Airport and the cabin crew. It was a short flight of only one hour, but very pleasant.
