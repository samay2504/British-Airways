### "Hot and humid the whole flight"
They charged me 11,600 for two regular size checked bags.The flight was only 1 hr and 15 minutes and it was a hotbox. Everybody was sweating. Hot and humid the whole flight.

### "Flight delayed was 3 hours"
Not Verified |  Flight delayed was 3 hours. No prior communication, they were well aware that our flight was delayed. We will never use this unreliable airline ever again.

### "flight experience went well"
Everything about the flight experience went well. I was worried reading the other reviews but in the end it was a very positive experience. The terminal in El Nido is also very good.

### "been a real disaster"
Not Verified |   My experience with Airswift has been a real disaster, our flight has been delayed twice, and as a result we have missed two flights. They don't give you complaint forms. Do not fly with this company.

### "AirSwift does not refund anything"
We bought a Coron Manila ticket and 2 nights before the flight, they changed destination to Clark, instead of Manila, as I had bought. Never received any notification for this. Clark is a 3-hour taxi ride from Manila. We then had a Manila Bangkok and then a Bangkok Dubai flight. We had left almost 5 hours of layover in Manila for greater security. The next day (about 18 hours before the flight), they informed us that not only had changed destination, but that the flight had been delayed by 2 hours, so we would no longer be able to take our connecting flight, so we had to buy another one. Manila Bangkok (USD1200 for 3 pax). The next day, the flight arrived in Coron 2 hours late, causing us to lose the new ticket (Usd1,200 to the trash). We finally had to buy a Manila Dubai (USD1300). Now AirSwift does not refund anything, because they say that flying the Coron-Clark, we accepted its flight. Obviously, there was no other alternative to leave Coron.

### "unreliable and unprofessional"
Pathetic excuse for an airline. Totally unreliable and unprofessional. Expect them to cancel or make massive changes to your reservation as soon as they have your money.

### "Gave no reason for cancellation"
Not Verified |  Cancelled our flight from El Nido to Bohol at a weeks notice but there are no other options for this journey so had to spend an afternoon of our holiday completely changing itineraries. Can’t get to Bohol now, lost money on hotel booking. Gave no reason for cancellation and no it’s not bad weather. Still haven’t refunded. Would never book again being so unreliable.

### "cancelled the flight due to weather"
They started by delaying the flight 3 hours. After everyone had checked in and the last flight from the airport left for the day, they cancelled the flight “due to weather”. Every other flight took off that day and there were other airlines flying to the same destination as this flight. They failed to reimburse costs for hotel room and car service to the airport. Next day the rescheduled flight was over an hour late. The fact that they lie to everyone about the reason for the cancel and take no responsibility for their incompetence has made it so I will never fly with them again. Take the ferry, it will save you time and a headache

### "choose any other airline than AirSWIFT"
Not Verified |  After I booked a flight from Manila to El Nido, I read a slew of bad reviews regarding last minute cancellations that are common with this airline. And that was concerning to me, but what could I do at that point? Sure as heck, 24 hours before my flight from Manila was supposed to depart, I received an email from Airswift saying my flight was cancelled due to maintenance issues as well. If you choose to go to Palawan, I would choose any other airline than AirSWIFT even if it means a long bus ride to El Nido.

### "Good service in flight"
Caticlan to El Nido in ATR 42-600. They rolled a carpet from to the plane to enter and exit. Good service in flight, on time flight and greeted with umbrellas from the plane to the arrival hall of the airport to avoid the hot sun in El Nido. 10 plus for this flight.

### "crews and ground staff friendly"
Manila to El Nido. AirSWIFT is a Philippine boutique airline offering daily roundtrip flights from Manila to El Nido. And this is the only way to go to El Nido. If you book any property of the El Nido Resorts, you would get a discount on its flight. And there is also a VIP lounge for guests of El Nido Resorts in the airport. They fly AT4, a very old plane. Do not expect to have much service in this short one hour ride. Of course also no any entertainment. But the crews and ground staff are friendly.
