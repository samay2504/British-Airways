### "we were stranded"
We had 2 flights booked and paid with this company, both flights were cancelled, we were stranded in the middle of the country with a cruise ship to catch. They would not reply to email, they have an English contact number, with messages in Spanish, absolutely useless. Took our money and got absolutely nothing. I don't agree with the rating of 1/10, should be zero like the service we received.

### "have not reimbursed my money"
Buenos Aires to Bariloche. The airline canceled my flight without letting me know. I had paid for 4 passengers. At the check in they informed me the flight was canceled and they offered no help. I had to book last minute with another airline for over twice the cost and Andes Líneas Aéreas still have not reimbursed my money.

### "avoid at all costs"
Buenos Aires to Iguazu. Our flight was cancelled 20 minutes before departure time; no planes available! After standing in line for hours the airline just reimbursed our airfare. No other flights were offered and no hotel or food vouchers either. We were few lucky ones who flew out on another airline at $1,000 extra cost for a one hour flight. Our ticket was part of a package. I would avoid this airline at all costs in future.

### "This airline is a mess"
Tucuman to Buenos Aires. This airline is a mess. Our flight was delayed for 10 hours without notification, we were dropped at the wrong airport, and missed our hotel reservation and were forced to sleep in the airport. No accommodations were made by the airline and we were just notified that our flight back is changed again. This is unacceptable. This airline has caused people to miss reservations, wait long hours, and nothing changes.
