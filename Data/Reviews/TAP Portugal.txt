### "Terrible customer service"
Not Verified |  Terrible customer service, very disorganised boarding, delayed flights and super expensive tickets. The quality of the worst low-cost combined with higher than average prices. Very little value for money!

### "They should be ashamed"
They should be ashamed of the practices the airline is employing to avoid paying compensation, at the expense of their customers. The staff say is a 'delay" rather than 'rescheduling" when they know they will fly 6-7 hours later. We were flying with a 5 year old child and the call centre firmly told us to be at the airport 3 hours before scheduled time, or otherwise we will be considered late - because the flight is "late" rather than "rescheduled". They knew you will not fly at 5AM, but at 12PM, having "delayed" the flight a week in advance. A disgrace of the company.

### "food is only for purchase"
Early morning flight, but late probably due to the poor performance of Lisbon airport. The aircraft, CS-TPU is 13 years old and not looking good, and the cabin is of the most basic standards. No wifi or entertainment system , and food is only for purchase. The cabin crew does not seem to care much about safety, as they allowed non body abled people to seat on the emergency exits, and they did not think about moving them somewhere else.

### "staff insisted on 23 kg luggage"
Not Verified |  The airline allowed to use priority boarding for passengers with little kids. On check-in the staff insisted on 23 kg luggage, so it's better to be prepared. They allowed to check-in one handbag as a luggage for free.

### "a most professional airline"
Marrakech to Lisbon was an absolute pleasure! Firstly the website must be commended as it is logical and user-friendly. Prior to my flights the airline sent out emails with instructions and prompts to check-in online. This was impressive and I was indeed able to check-in very easily online. Marrakech airport was very busy when I travelled and one can but commend the staff at the bag drop for their professionalism and courtesy. The flight was delayed due to fog in Lisbon. The flight was operated by an E195 and was parked at a considerable distance from the gate hence a bus was used to transfer the passengers to the aircraft. The cabin crew were immaculately dressed in a distinctive TAP uniform and warmly greeted the passengers. Due to the delay the crew offered water to the passengers. The captain made a very clear series set of announcements and kept the passengers informed about the delays. During the flight snacks were available for purchase along with drinks to purchase too. Disembarkation was efficient and well managed. On this trip TAP proved to be a most professional airline and one would gladly use their services again. Thank you TAP!

### "it was rejected immediately"
Not Verified | Lack of Lounge Access on four flight sectors. On Dec 2 in LHR T2 TAP use the Lufthansa lounge. At check-in I was asked if I knew its location which I did. Sadly it was close for refurbishment with directions to other Star Alliance lounges 15 minutes away. With osteoarthritis I was unable to walk 15 mins each way to an alternative lounge. I therefore purchased breakfast for the two of us at a cost of £40. Following TAP procedures, I claimed for this amount but it was rejected immediately and again today when I raised this issue again. I choose to fly Business Class to use lounges.

### "refused to honor baggage allowance"
Charged €107.83 at the airport because TAP refused to honor my 30kg baggage allowance. SQ Airlines confirmed it, but TAP? Pay first, beg for a refund later. Called three times—no case number, no follow-up, total silence. Had to beg on Facebook just to get a response. Two weeks later, I received an email, but its TAP demanding for bank documents. Thereafter, they "agreed" it can be processed. It’s January 29th still no refund. If you enjoy paying for services you never receive and chasing refunds, TAP is for you. Their airport staff are rude. TAP's feedback form is always "under maintenance," so even refund requests are a dead end.

### "the boarding was chaotic"
Terrible. Our flight was delayed from 7.50pm to 9.16pm, the boarding was chaotic and they forced us to load one of our bags with the checked luggage, despite it being of the right size for cabin and having the plane with plenty of space. The personell was rude and not helpful. Never again

### "incredibly frustrating and disappointing"
This airline has been the worst airline experience I’ve encountered. First, my flight was delayed by two hours, causing me to miss my connecting flight. They rebooked me on a later flight to Barcelona at 5:30 PM. While I wasn’t thrilled, I accepted it since it wasn’t too late. However, they then canceled the 5:30 PM flight and rebooked me on an 8:55 PM flight instead. I was originally supposed to arrive in Barcelona by 5 PM at the latest, but now I won’t get there until nearly midnight. When I called their customer service to request being placed back on the 5:30 PM flight, I was met with rudeness. They claimed no supervisor was available and insisted there was nothing they could do. Meanwhile, I checked their website and saw that they were still selling tickets for the 5:30 PM flight, but at an outrageously high price—proof that seats were available. This entire experience has been incredibly frustrating and disappointing.

### "substituted a short haul aircraft"
Not Verified |  TAP substituted a short haul aircraft for the long haul aircraft that they promised during booking. That meant an overnight flight of 9 hours in an economy seat. The cabin crew were rude, saying this was due to an emergency change of plane. But when you look at flight tracking websites you can see that they have substituted a short haul aircraft for the past 5 days.

### "My suitcase never arrived"
My suitcase never arrived with me in Lyon, I have tried to submit a claim to get a refund for the expenses I had to make because I had nothing with me arriving in Lyon. Of course I couldn’t do it via their website. Therefore I reach out to the customer service, that told me that I had to deal with the previous company I was flying with whereas the law is very clear : last airline flown is the responsible one to create a missing/delay bag file, proceed with search and provide you all the needed assistance. The client service close the call with me because they did not want to help me saying this was not their matter.

### “I have yet to receive a reply”
Disclaimer: I am not petty. I don't normally go "full Karen" in most cases. I know it's hard to make everyone happy when you're an airline dealing with many different needs and demands. TAP has some of the best pilots, planes, and flight attendants. However, please be aware of this company's bureaucracy and its horrible customer service. My complaint was filed with TAP 5 days ago and I have yet to receive a reply, forget about a resolution. I went to their Lisbon "Headquarters" and the Lisbon terminal customer service desk about being denied travel from Porto to Newark, NJ on November 19, 2024. No one was able to help me. They also told me there were no managers to speak with customers. How are there no managers, supervisors, or persons in charge to speak to customers whenever an agent can't or won't help a customer? They just gave me a phone number or said to check online. This is the mindset of TAP and Portugal's public workers' sector. They feel entitled and arrogantly emboldened to not give a damn about the public. My matter would've been resolved with a simple phone call to US Customs. Bear in mind that I was traveling with my 89-year-old father who was in a wheelchair. Not another red cent of my money will go to TAP.

### "separating her from my sister and myself"
I was traveling with my sister and elderly mother who required a wheelchair. We paid extra to be seated together at the front so it would be easier for wheelchair boarding. We travel regularly on different airlines and we always pay for seats upfront for ease of boarding. Never had a problem until we took this airline. Upon trying to check in online, the airline was giving my mother a seat at the back (29B) separating her from my sister and myself. I messaged their staff on the problem but they insisted that wheelchair passengers have to be seated at the back and did not even offer a refund for the seats we bought. At the check in counter we requested if we can have our original seats (4A,B,C) that we paid for be given back to us but the rude and condescending agent insisted on 29B seat and told us to get a refund in Lisbon. What infuriated me more was seeing another wheelchair passenger given a seat at row 10. So what was that rule that wheelchair passengers were to be seated at the back?! Until now the airline has not refunded us for the seats we paid.

### "customer service who are completely inept"
TAP is the worst airline and customer service! I recently cancelled my fully refundable ticket due to a medical emergency (I have a doctor's note as well confirming this). I had also won an upgrade on this flight as well. However, TAP would only refund my flight and refused to refund my upgrade $1800. I called multiple times, the reps would put me on hold then hang up. After emailing as well, I was told to keep trying via their customer service phone number (which they would hang up anytime I was placed on hold). After 3 calls, I finally reached a person who did not put me on hold and was told they couldn't do anything. Only to be told they cannot refund a "service" fee despite me not even receiving that service! They will not even take the medical incident into account. They will just steal your $$ despite not even being on that flight. It is a scam, hidden fees and terrible customer service who are completely inept.

### "attendant was arrogant and petty"
Captain left the seat belt sign on for more than half the flight with only a few light turbulence that lasted only a couple of minute each, Lady in bulkhead seat 6F was told harshly to sit down when she went to the WC, . After a while she got up again and entered the WC. I got up (6A) to stand in line and was told to sit down until she left. My husband (7A) spoke to the attendant about it and was told he was only doing his job as the seat belt sign was on. After an exchange of words my husband said the attendant should tell the captain to turn the sign off as there hadn't been any turbulence for a while and people needed to use the WC. The sign was turned off a short while later so people could line up to use the WC. There was insufficient offers of liquids on an 8+ hour flight.. One small paper cup of wine with dinner, Meal was tasty but sparse - 2 tbs veal stew, 2 tbsp roast potato, 1 tbs chickpeas, small pudding - no salad or other greens. Several hours later - For breakfast, 1 small cup of water (or pop of juice) with 1 slice of ham, much smaller than the bun, and a smaller piece of very wilted lettuce. A small chocolate desert was tasty. No offer of coffee or tea, no other service to offer a drink,even water, between meals. Overall our attendant was arrogant and petty during the flight - including serving breakfast to 6 B, C, D, E and F and then me in A. This airline used to be equivalent in service and seats to another airline. But no longer. Its Premium Economy only meant a bit more leg room; nothing more. From now on we will take another airline in our twice yearly flight to Lisbon.

### “no one will try to assist or help you”
Tap Air Portugal (LIS), avoid if you can, airline only interested in getting your money (not getting you safely where ever you are going to). We’ve missed the flight in October half term as the queue at the customs (after Security check) on 29/10/2024 between 6-11pm, was over two hours, there are no airline staff on the ground by customs and you’d be refused help if you’d ask to be fast tracked or given priority, even though the airline is aware you are checked in and queueing inside the terminal - third of passengers do not make it on the plane because of the delays inside the terminal!! If you miss you flight you’d have to queue again for over 2hrs to get your stamp cancelled and then someone at Tap Air customer service desk will laugh in your face and say they are not responsible and the next available flight is in a weeks time. No matter if you complain no one will try to assist or help you, the only option is to raise a complain with highest authority (custom police) but do you really want to risk it and possibly get locked up?

### "carry-ons should be checked"
This airline's gate staff walk around the departure gate areas to force passengers to check in their carry-on, even if the carry-ons are within airline carry-on specs. They refuse to measure the carry-ones with their card box for carry-on specs. They use all kind of lame excuses for why the carry-ons should be checked, such as they are "heavy" or for "security" reasons. They do this despite protests and appeals. This is infuriating, unfair and causes inconvenience when collecting checked-in carry-ons at destinations. This is also a shame because their flight attendant staff are professional, helpful and kind during flights. Every one of my flights for this airline out of Lisbon airport is delayed by at least an hour because of air traffic congestion at the airport. Passengers for domestic flights for this airline out of the Lisbon airport must be bused for a long distance from the terminal to the airplane. That is because the airport (Terminal 2) is undersized and outdated. The airport is in need of renovation and expansion. Seats are not comfortable. Your knees (I'm 5' 10") bang against the seat in front. All food and drinks on European flights are for purchase, except for drinking water - Thank goodness!

### "taken our hand baggage"
Ground staff lack of any sort of communication skills. They have taken our hand baggage and checked it in because flight had “full occupation”. They wouldn’t even care to explain, just put the tag on at the gate and gave a nod to carry on. When we asked to keep the baggage they only said “it’s a low fare flight and cabin baggage is not guaranteed”. Would not fly with them again.

### "will never fly TAP again"
Not Verified | What does it state about an airline when their baggage handlers protested to go on strike. I think it means that airline doesn’t care about their employees. Which leads to question if they care about their customers. If you try to file a complaint. It’s a run around about which digits you need to input from TP number, flight number, date of flight and so on. It’s cluster mess with no end in sight. Maybe that’s the idea to confuse the complainant to give up. I’m not the typical person to give up. I will fight for the 65€ TAP doesn’t want to refund me. Their automatic email states that their policy is that they don’t give refunds. I guess it’s written in stone. No wonder the baggage handlers wanted to go on strike, because they wanted change. I guess that also was written stone that they can’t ask for more or change. The question is who wants to fly an airline doesn’t view change as good or be employed by them. Are their employees happy? I suggest they fight against TAP. Fight for what you need from TAP. Make them TAP OUT!! I will make my comments public. I just want a refund. I will never fly TAP again.

### "don't pay for Comfort Class"
TAP Portugal might be just fine for someone flying alone, who doesn't care where on the plane you sit. However, you should NOT pay extra for "Comfort Class" assigned seating, because you are likely to end up being put in Economy, with no opportunity for a refund. My wife and I paid $170 each ($340 in total) for Comfort Class assigned seating by the window, but for both flights (TO Lisbon and back to Chicago) we ultimately had to fly in Economy section seats in order to be together. We did "on-line check-in" the day before our flight and discovered we weren't in the seats we had paid for. We called Custormer Service to ask why we didn't get our assigned seats, and for the first leg (to Lisbon), the customer rep said that despite what we saw on the App, we really still had our assigned seats. However, when we got boarding passes at the airport (2 1/2 hours before our flight) we were in the center section (not by the window) and when the gate attendant moved us to window seats, we didn't realize she was moving us to Economy. For our return flight, the On-Line Check-in showed I was assigned to Row 9 and my wife was in Row 32. We called Customer Service (20 hours before the flight) and when we explained the situation and requested our assigned seats, the first Rep "put us on hold," but then hung up on us. The second rep did the same thing. When we got the THIRD representative, we explained we had "been disconnected" twice already, so she took my cell-phone number. After 10 minutes or so of her explaining they had "overbooked" the Comfort Class she gave us two choices - either go to the gate the next day and hope they could assign us seats together, OR choose Economy Class seats by a window now, but accept that there would be no "refund" for the $340 we had paid for assigned seating. As we continued the discussion, the Rep claimed that my cell-phone signal was "breaking up" (even though it had been fine all along), and when I said to my wife that I wasn't going to hang up on the Rep because "the signal might come back," the Rep obviously heard that just fine, and hung up on us (and didn't call back). Overall, if you fly TAP, don't pay for Comfort Class assigned seating, because you might not get it.

### "Potentially the worst ground staff"
Not Verified | Potentially the worst ground staff I’ve ever experienced anywhere! I’ve got numerous flight under my belt and I have never seen a more disorganized, uninformed and uninterested group of individuals in any flight I’ve been on. And then on board “I can’t commit to time of arrival—so sorry”. Just a true mess and really enormous lack of timely information or updates. Potentially one of the most terrible flight experiences I’ve had. Terrible.

### "seemed utterly miserable"
On my flight out to Lisbon on TP1351 on 10 September 2024 I received the worst treatment from any flight attendant in over 70 years of flying and I shall take care never to use TAP again. The steward strutted up and down the aisle and when I requested a glass of water he slammed down a paper cup so that it splashed everywhere. When I then asked for another, for my wife, he practically shouted so you want two then. On my return flight on TP 1364 on 17 September 2024 the attendants were barely more civil, and all seemed utterly miserable. As I said - never again on TAP!

### "nearly €70 in an excess baggage fee"
Awful baggage policy and service. One of our suitcases broke so instead of checking in two bags which we had paid for (2x 23kg), we brought one 40kg bag. TAP staff attempted to charge for a separate cargo fee as we were told we couldn't fly with a bag that heavy. As a result, we then decided to check in a backpack as a second bag, and to distribute the weight across both. The larger bag was still 30kg, so we were forced to pay nearly €70 in an excess baggage weight fee. Staff were hostile and uncompromising.

### “extremely uncomfortable”
Not Verified | Minimal legroom, extremely uncomfortable for anyone over 1m7cm. My last 4 flights with them were either delayed or they lost my luggage. Worst airline I've travelled with.

### "the worst seat on the plane"
I flew to Belém for a 2 day business trip on 04/09/24 The flight out was good and gave good feedback. The promotional videos showing proper business class seats, entertainment, WiFi and good food and the flights lived up to this. The return flights were complete different. I was returning to a full work schedule and wanted to sleep. Unfortunately, on the overnight flight from Belém I was seating next to a very annoying passenger who hit me to wake me up while I was sleeping. The flights got from Lisbon to LHR was delayed by 1.15 hrs during the stop over I decided not eat expecting a full service on the flight. Disappointed no business class seats, no WiFi , no entertainment and a very poor snack. I felt I would have been better on Ryanair! My seat 1D must have been the worst seat on the plane. There was no leg room. I have severe OA in both knees and ankles and the only place I could but feet was slightly into the isle to the side of the partition. My feet were constantly being kicked by the staff and they said nothing, When I raised concerns with the steward he told me he was aware that he was kicking my feet but there was no space. So if you want to take the risk of paying a business class fare and enjoy pain and torture book TAP Lisbon to LHR.

### “customer service is horrible”
Not Verified | They lost my luggage and customer service is horrible. I’ve been waiting on a customer service phone line for hours and they are saying they that they will not send my luggage and I need to pick it up from the airport. I’m saying I’m not anymore in Lisbon so you will send it to me. After I’m trying to convince them they finally say ok I will connect you to another person and they disconnect the whole call. I’m back on the waiting line for one hour and I wasn’t able to get in the phone for 5 second and they disconnect me again. They ask you to make a complaint online but there’s some weird TP numbers and they are nowhere to find? No other information, no one is answering and the luggage is waiting at an airport?

### "never to use TAP airline again"
Between 2022 and 2024 I used TAP airlines to fly between London and Lisbon. My flight with TAP in April of this year will be the last time I will use them. I have experienced delays, and last-minute cancellations (made for "commercial reasons"), where I had to find overnight accommodation at midnight. With my last flight, a "station manager" decided that an unframed artwork that I was taking on the flight with me was not allowed to travel (even though it was paid for and was legitimate onboard-luggage according to TAP website). This information was given to me by one of the manager's underlings - the manager himself refused to either come and speak to me in person to inspect the package containing the artwork. As I was delivering the painting to an exhibition this was incredibly frustrating. When I made an official complaint I was fobbed off with "Sorry, I hope to doesn't happen again" I have travelled to Lisbon since but have travelled with a different airline and intend never to use TAP airline again for their shoddy and unsympathetic approach to customer care

### “Customer service offered no refund”
Flight from Lisbon to Newark, but we didn’t land in Newark due to weather which is perfectly fine. Landed in Boston, sat on the plane for an hour +, as they mentioned we would refuel and head back. Flight was then canceled, customer service did not give any information for over an hour. People were sleeping on the floor in Boston and not enough cots for everyone. Was told a bus would take us at 8am, but not hotel accommodations were offered. So stayed in airport for over 8 hours. Food and water was also not provided. Customer service offered no refund. Definitely would not fly with them again or recommend to a friend.

### "very pleasant first experience"
Montreal to Lisbon on TAP Portugal. First time flying with this carrier. The check-in was slow with only two agents processing both economy and premium passengers. Used the Air Canada lounge prior to boarding which had a good selection of food and drinks including made to order cocktails. Boarding was on time and efficient. Onboard, the hard product offered ample privacy as both my wife and I had the throne style single seats on opposite sides of the aisle. The FA’s were very attentive and professional. After take off, we were served a three course meal complete with a selection Portuguese wines and international spirits. My meal was OK at best but service made up for what it lacked in taste and quality. The Portuguese wines were very good though. After the meal I reclined the seat to the full flat position but found to footwell extremely tight offering little to no movement opportunity. The seat was also quite hard. The IFE had a limited selection of movies so I opted for sleep instead. I used the free texting option which worked well throughout the journey. The flight left slightly behind schedule but arrived early. Overall a very pleasant first experience with TAP Portugal.

### "we had to beg to get on"
Not Verified |  TAP Portugal has its pros and cons. Service was great, we got blankets and even pillows, onboard Wi-Fi, great selection of movies for kids and adults of all ages, the food was great, and the flight attendants were very great. On the downside, they confused us with departure time, they said that our airplane was delayed by like 5 - 10 mins, but it turns out in Lisbon Airport they do passport control before reaching the gate (which in my opinion is the worst thing ever, they should’ve done it at security instead.) and we basically almost missed our flight. The staff at the gate were being ruthless and we had to beg to get on, otherwise we would’ve had to stay in a hotel, and we managed to get on at the last minute. This was all because of lack of communication during customer service, and believe me I wasn’t willing to stay for another night at Lisbon. TAP Portugal did repay the favor though with its comfort and on-board meals and snacks. But if you’re taking TAP Portugal, please make sure you find the correct departure time and show up maybe 3-4 hours before at Lisbon Airport, otherwise you might end up almost missing your TAP flight.

### "Entire crew was attentive"
Flight was on-time. Aircraft was very clean and smells good. Boarding was quickly completed. I was surprised I had the entire row to myself during the peak travel time. IFE was decent though the music collection was excellent. Entire crew was attentive and had a smile during the entire journey. Dinner was served right after the take-off. Ample amount of chicken with vegetables and mashed potatoes, dessert, salad, bread all included. Metal cutlery. Drinks were served twice. Breakfast sandwich was super dry and bread was stale but rest of the items were decent. Landed on time and crew said good-bye with a great smile. Both ends of the aircraft were opened to disembark passengers so within 10 mins, we were out. Lisbon airport was a polar opposite experience.

### “No apologies by the airline whatsoever”
Worst possible experience I ever had with an airline. Almost everything that could have went wrong, actually did. A summary of the facts below to give you an idea. - The flight was delayed by 1,5 hours at Schiphol. We were barely able to make it to our transfer, running at the airport with 2 young kids. No apologies by the airline whatsoever, they blamed Schiphol and took 0 accountability. - The baggage wasn't available at our final destination. We waited for over 1 hour at the baggage belt. No TAP personnel was present to file a missing bag report. We were given a QR code to file a report online. The complaint form did not function as intended on my phone. When I tried to file a missing bag report on my phone it mentioned: "A missing bag report for this bag is already present, despite me not having filed any previous reports". We therefore decided to file a report on paper with the airport personnel. - I called costumer service multiple times. The first time I called, they mentioned that during weekends they weren't searching for missing bags and not able to check the system. They requested me to call after the weekend had ended. Very strange for a company that is transporting people every day (not just the week days) - Called again on monday, got into contact with customer service. Got mentioned twice in a row, they had all essential information and were able to track the bags. Was requested to wait while they sorted the last things out, only to get the line cut after 20 seconds two times in a row. - In over 2 weeks we had nobody contact us regarding our missing bags. Not by phone, not by email. Not even a confirmation the report was received properly. After 15 days I get a 2 sentence message via mail that the bags had been found. If only it ended there. - Used complaint forms on the website (multiple issues). After over 3 weeks the status of the complaints is still 'under analysis' without any response whatsoever. - After 25 days one of the 3 bags is finally delivered home. The other 2 are still missing. 1 day after the delivery of the one bag, I get a call from a TAP Portugal employee. She wanted to confirm my bags were all delivered. When I mentioned I only got 1 bag, she started raising her voice claiming that I must have received 3 bags. I had to tell her multiple times I only received one bag before she would stop. She said: No you are wrong you got all the bags. In the end she let out a long sigh, mentioned that she would be looking into things futher, and hang up the phone straight after without giving me any additonal information on what to expect. - I tried calling TAP after this strange encounter a few days after, since two of my bags were still missing (25 days after initial arrival), and after trying for over 1 hour without getting into contact with an employee (at 10 AM CEST) I just gave up. - I am still waiting for my 2 bags as I'm writing this review, and have yet to hear anything back on my request for financial compensation. Do yourself a favour. Please pay a little more for a trustworthy and competent airline. Don't make my mistake by booking with TAP. If things don't go as planned, you will regret it.

### “one of the best in Europe”
I flew 2 sectors with TAP first leg LIS-PDL with A320 neo on the European business class which is basically economy but they block the middle seat. Trip was very nice the leg room is very generous and seat is comfy a nice meal was served and the crew were very friendly and smiling. Aircraft was in excellent condition. Then I flew FNC-LIS on economy class on A330-900 neo again a fantastic flight very clean aircraft leg room is spacious on a 2-4-2 configuration and personal IFE which was personalized with my name my ticket didn’t include a meal but it was a short flight and a lot of options were on board to buy. I’m very happy with TAP as I believe one of the best in Europe. Not the case with Lisbon airport.

### "Would fly with TAP again"
Not Verified | Flight itself was good. Friendly crew and comfortable seats. Unfortunately, we were delayed by more than one hour. When waiting in the bus to be taken to the plane we were instructed to go back into the terminal as they needed to switch planes. Once in the plane we waited 40 minutes before takeoff. Staff was friendly and helpful though and kept us updated throughout. Would fly with TAP again

### "Never got the correct amount refunded"
I had originally booked a flight before covid hit. Due to covid travel was not possible. I asked for a refund, which was not granted correctly. Calling 5 times, sending in "complaints" by their official form, even talking to the ground office in Portugal directly. None of this helped. Never got the correct amount refunded.

### "canceled while I was at the gate"
Not Verified |   I've been flying TAP for many years. The service is mediocre, but since they are usually cheaper, I've accepted the inconveniences: bad staff attitude, lost luggage, no customer service, etc. This has been a very bad decision. This airline has serious management issues, and my day of having my own TAP nightmare finally arrived. My flight was canceled while I was at the gate, waiting to board. They didn’t notify anyone, just removed the flight completely from the board, leaving everyone confused. When someone finally appeared to give information, they just told everyone to recollect their checked-in luggage and wait. It's clear they are saving every penny and don’t have enough staff, who were completely lost and acted as if they had no idea what to do (and they didn’t). In Paris Orly, they had three people to manage hordes of people from the canceled flight and those waiting to check in. After several hours of waiting, they offered some very bad connections and, when they realized that everything was overbooked, decided to send us to a hotel. They struggled to book the hotel and had very confusing information on transport, leaving us to carry our luggage on foot. I was with an elderly person, and it was not easy. When we boarded the next day, the entertainment screen on my seat was not working properly. The flight was filled with very discontented people sharing their horror stories about this airline. It took me 4 days to reach my final destination. Note: this was all in business class, so don’t expect any premium service. Flight attendants are rude and seem very irritated all the time, and the food is very poor and limited, served in a single tray like in economy. They have a tendency to call business passengers to board first but leave them in line for up to an hour at the door of the plane without the AC. Economy requires even more resilience. When we left the airport after the canceled flight, the line for passengers flying economy was even worse. The atrocious situation of this airline is compounded by the fact that Lisbon airport is way beyond its capacity, so expect delays and failed attempts to land. This has happened to me several times—even the pilot admitted this situation during a go-around. Everyone is fed up with this airline and this airport. Cherry on the cake: without warning, my return trip was canceled, and they told me they would not refund me. Follow the advice of thousands of people who had their vacations and business plans spoiled by this airline and please avoid TAP.

### "a budget airline experience"
Terrible experience with TAP Portugal - on a business class flight from Warsaw to Lisbon (a 4h flight) they actually put a charter rented from Lithuanian Get Jet company which is what it is - a low cost subpar experience. The seats are cramped, close to each other, front row with the bulkhead right in your face, no space whatsoever. The food is mediocre, the flight attendants are poor mainly talking to themselves or other friends on the flight. If you have a choice, avoid TAP on this route at all cost as it is a budget airline experience.

### "the soft service is so poor"
I bought premium tickets nearly a year in advance. Paid for Premium seating and reserved front row seats. A couple of days before flying I realized that our seat reservations had been discarded and there were no premium seats left. Pay for premium, get standard. The website is an abominable mess. It's really hard to see seat allocations-- sometimes work but mostly doesn't. Phone services is near impossible to reach. On arrival we realized that our seats had been taken for staff use. They used them a small part of the flight. Wouldn't have minded so much except that the staff service is poor. Unlike better airlines where the staff bring water to avoid dehydration you have to either dehydrate or go beg for water. Staff refused to take food containers from our neighbor during a trash run saying they would come back. But didn't return. Shame that the soft service is so poor. The hard product -- planes, food, etc weren't too bad.

### "never book a flight with TAP again"
This airline is the worst. You pay for upgrades, you don’t get them. If you have dietary restrictions forget it, they don’t pay attention to your needs! Delays and more delays ! And when you get to you your connection one hour later, then don’t even instruct passengers to remain seated and let the people out that are running to catch their connections before they miss their flights. Horrible breakfast. Everything is cheap, but the price you pay for your ticket, upgrades and luggage. Lisbon airport is pure chaos. Lounge? Regardless if you have a Signature platinum card or not they still want you to pay 55Euros to access it. I will never book a flight with TAP again and I recommend no one does!

### "I had the worst experience"
Try to avoid this airline if possible. I had the worst experience of my life traveling with them. They showed no respect and treated people with complete disregard. I hope will never flight with them.

### “Awful customer service”
Awful customer service, awful airline. Massively overpriced. You’re far better getting a cheaper ticket with easyJet or Ryanair. Paid 600€ for a flexible ticket only to be told to cost of changing to flight is 200€.

### "food and wine were good"
Fantastic airline. Wonderful staff. The food and wine were good. Drinks were frequently served and refreshed. One other passenger became sick on board; the crew tended to the passenger.

### "not received any reimbursement"
Not Verified |   I traveled from Geneva to Fortaleza with my kitesurfing equipment, for which I paid an additional fee for a sports bag. The issues with the airline began right after the booking payment on the website. Immediately after they charged me, I received an email instructing me to contact customer service because my additional sports bag was not guaranteed for the return flight, which was operated by another airline. Fortaleza to Recife, operated by Azul Linhas Aereas Brasileiras. After calling customer service, I was assured the issue was resolved and that I would receive an email confirming my bag was allowed on the flight. However, no such email was sent. I had to call twice more to sort this out, or so I thought. When it was time to fly back from Fortaleza, I arrived at the check-in counter with my kitesurfing bag, only to be told that TAP Portugal had neither paid for nor booked my additional bag. I called customer service, and after numerous apologies, they advised me to open a ticket for a reimbursement as I had to pay for the bag again. Despite filing my complaint in November 2023 and contacting them more than 10 times, I have not received any reimbursement. Each time, I was told to be patient and given false promises. Today, on June 5, 2024, I called customer service in Lisbon again and spoke with an agent who informed me that my case was closed. She advised me to reopen a ticket or complaint on their website, which has left me extremely frustrated. I got upset, and she hung up on me. I would never recommend flying with TAP Air Portugal, especially because their customer service is useless, unresponsive, and unhelpful in times of need. You have to sort everything out by yourself and will end up in losing money. I will never fly with TAP Air Portugal again.

### “Never again on TAP”
Not Verified | Terrible customer service, no communication. Luggage arrived 9 days after my arrival in Rome for our 11 day cruise, despite airtag and passenger name and phone number being on the bag. Paper form required to file a complaint. Receipt of form not acknowledged, no email or telephone contact made to passenger. Customer service line only open from 3pm to 9pm weekdays, not on weekends. We called daily for a status and they said the bag could not be located. However, they moved it from Lisbon to Rome on day 2, when they realized it was tagged for Rome. Bag sat in Rome airport for 8 days with no attempt to contact passenger. Clothing, medications, jewelry, shoes and toiletries were all stuck in Rome while we tried to vacation. I cancelled our return flight on Tap and instead flew on Swiss Air. Swiss Air held connecting flight, all luggage arrived on time AND next day we received a confirmation that all luggage was received by passengers. Never again on TAP.

### "the rudest staff"
Truly the rudest staff I have ever encountered to the point of vindictive. Extraordinary. I have been flying for over 50 years and have never complained. This airline needs an attitude overhaul. I will avoid flying TAP at all costs. It’s a shame since I love Portugal but would prefer curling to Spain than to have such an experience repeated.

### “Staff rude and not flexible”
Not Verified | We travelled with TAP this morning and we only packed light as we had commitments. We were forced to send our hand luggage to the hold despite explaining to the staff that we needed to leave the airport ASAP. Staff rude and not flexible although we were one of the first people entering the plane and we were from zone A. Legroom is short and because they want to put more people on a small plane than we are forced to do send our luggage to the hold. Not good standard company. I had my luggage lost by them before and I was very worried it would happened again. It wasn’t the case this time but we had to wait 40min for our luggage when we could leave straightaway. Low standards for a non low cost company. Not recommended. I prefer to pay extra for BA because TAP is getting worse and worse. Shame!

### "insisted on checking my personal item"
TAP was very disappointing. It's regulations say passengers can bring a carry-on and one personal item. Yet, when boarding the flight, the attendants insisted on checking my personal item, which contained electronics, valuables and breakables. I explained this to no avail. It left me with no container to carry these items. On top of that, the overhead cabins had plenty of room. Fly planes big enough to accommodate the allowed carryons or have some sense and use your brain to make an exception.

### “would advise against this airline”
I haven’t flown TP since 1966 when a taxi driver in Lisbon told me and my parents that TAP stood for take another plane. I always thought it was a good joke, but didn’t experience their service until a company I consult for arranged a round trip flight from Washington Dulles to Berlin through Lisbon. I appreciate that TP is a lower price airline and all I really care about is the lie flat seat. But the food was surprisingly bad in business class. More important than that is the chaotic boarding process I just experienced in Berlin. There was no pre-board for people with disabilities, which was a real problem for a number of the older folks. This is unforgivable for a quality airline. And I write this as a 1K customer on United so I spend way too much time in the air. I would advise against this airline.

### “Another terrible Business class experience”
Embraer E90/95. Another terrible Business class experience on a tap embraer E90/95 aircraft. It's simply astounding to me that this airline continues to fly inferior aircraft that failed to have a vacant seat between two seats in business class, which is one of the main benefits of flying TAP business class in the first place. Tap continues to put on more and more of these planes on key routes and it completely destroys the value proposition of flying business class. There is no good reason to fly tap in business class within Europe on these aircraft. They are simply uncomfortable and tap is taking advantage of everybody by flying them. You have to be really careful with tap because when you book it could say you have an aircraft like an Airbus 320 but they can change that at a moment's notice and they do and you're stuck in the Embraer and believe me they won't refund you anything for the fact that you thought you bought a ticket for an Airbus and had a lot of empty space around you and they threw you on an Embraer. Their operations leave a lot to be desired, as does their integrity and I say this as a frequent customer.

### "beyond unacceptable behaviour"
What a horrid experience yesterday! We were taken by bus to board the plane at ground level. We then were stuck on the bus for over 20 minutes with no air. I asked for the doors to please be opened for air, three times in 3 different languages. Nothing happened. My claustrophobia was getting worse and my husband opened the door we were standing in front of. An older man on ground crew proceeded to push my husband and scream at him. He jammed his hands in the door which caused them to bleed. Another ground crew came inside to apologize and allowed for 2 doors to be opened. But left my husband by a closed door with bleeding fingers. When it was time to get on the plane, the man came straight for my husband yelled and pushed him hard. I had to get in the middle to stop it and screamed for him to stop. This was beyond unacceptable behaviour by a ground crew. We travel the world and will ensure we avoid TAP Portugal at all costs in future travel!

### "business class is absolutely awful"
Nothing good to say at all about Tap's Portugalia subsidiary or their business class product. The E90 is an absolutely terrible plane for business class travelers because there is no empty seat in the middle between passengers. Basically, it's no different than an economy seat and you're paying a large premium for it. I'm a TAP gold customer and feel they generally do a good job but they are increasingly using E90 and eE95 aircraft on key routes within Europe and business class is absolutely awful. Also worth mentioning the lounge is third rate at best. It's overcrowded with insufficient seating and toilet facilities and it's filthy with unremarkable food.

### “Customer service was horrible”
Not Verified | I have used the same carry on for years with no problem. I even used it on this plane on the way to Portugal. When I was leaving today, I made it all the way to the gate and they they threatened not letting us on the plane unless we paid $360 for our bags that fit perfectly by weight and size. Unless your bag weighs less than negative 100 pounds and is the size of a grain of salt, you’re screwed. Customer service at the desk was horrible so good luck getting any help from them too. I’ll make sure to warn every person I know to never use TAP. The people in the seats all around me are also annoyed because it happened to them too so thank you for ruining the end of our trip.

### "service is far from satisfaction"
I traveled from Rome to NYC with connection in Lisbon. Flight attendant treat customers poorly. During my flight I came to kitchen to get myself water I saw a bottle of water on the counter and poured my self cup of water. One of the flight attendant come up to me and start yelling at me “Sir This is my water and do not touch it”. Took my cup and threw to garbage then asked me to get out of the kitchen. Also, Lisbon airport is the worse Airport to make connections with no signs or guidance which led me by mistake to get out of the airport and come again through security where they threw products I purchased in Rome airport I really advise anyone NOT to fly with this company The price might look good online but misleading and service is far from satisfaction.

### "insult and mistreat customers"
Not Verified |   Avoid at any cost. Had a full economy class fare with unrestricted changes. At arrival at Lisbon tried to change my Lis-Fra flight to an earlier one. An employee at the counter told me it would cost me 595€ to change my flight. Not only my fare allowed for it, but my flight was retailing for 250€ and the flight I wanted to change into was at 230€. Asked for a manager. Staff tells me we don't have managers. Asked for her full name and she refuses to share her name. Asked to check why on a PLUS fare, she wanted to charge 595€ for a change. She answered leave and don't make me waste my time. If you don't like it, buy a ticket online. An airline cannot operate with employees that insult and mistreat customers. Never again.

### "employee at Funchal airport lazy or incompetent"
I booked a flight on the Air Canada website to fly on 02 April from Funchal, Madeira to Vancouver via Lisbon and Toronto. The Funchal to Lisbon flight was Air Canada flown by TAP as their flight 1686. The flight from Lisbon to Toronto was Air Canada and from Toronto to Vancouver was Air Canada. When I checked in at Funchal airport the TAP employee would not issue my boarding passes for the Lisbon to Toronto or Toronto to Vancouver flights although she did check my luggage to Vancouver. She issued only my boarding pass for the Funchal to Lisbon flight and told me that I would be issued the other two boarding passes at the boarding gate in Lisbon airport. So when I arrived at the boarding gate in Lisbon for Air Canada flight to Toronto the airline employees there were surprised to see me because, thanks to the TAP employee at Funchal airport, the Air Canada computer system showed that I had not checked in to or boarded the Flight from Funchal to Lisbon. Consequently, my seat on the Lisbon to Toronto flight had been given away to another passenger. After extensive debate among themselves involving telephone calls to others and much computer searching I was issued a boarding pass and had to stand by in embarrassment as a passenger was involuntarily removed from the seat which I had been assigned. Much the same thing happened at the boarding gate in Toronto airport for my flight to Vancouver. Although in Toronto the Air Canada employees knew that I was on the flight from Lisbon to Toronto my seat to Vancouver had been given away when their computer system showed that I was not on the flight from Funchal to Lisbon. Was the TAP employee at Funchal airport lazy or incompetent or is TAP management incompetent for failing to honour its commitments to Air Canada as another Star Alliance partner much less to Air Canada when it agreed to an Air Canada codeshare with TAP? I would add that the TAP website was useless whenever I attempted to use it even when I was in Portugal. I have no criticism at all of the TAP flight attendants or pilots. They performed well.

### "leave my luggage for check-in"
I paid more when buying the ticket online for optional cabin luggage. Then when I checked in they tell mw the flight is full so I can't take my cabin luggage with me and have to leave my luggage for check-in. It's not as cheap as other airlines but their service is poorly run. I probably would expect this type of service from easyJet.

### "never flying TAP again"
Paid $20 for internet between Maputo and Lisbon, and it worked for less than an hour. When, after a couple of hours without service, I raised this with onboard staff, they checked my laptop and confirmed that the internet basically almost never works on that route, so I should request a refund. But TAP refused to provide a refund, insisting that there was connectivity the whole flight. (Despite me explaining that their own onboard staff had confirmed to me that it wasn't working!) Am now reversing the charge via my bank, and never flying TAP again.

### "refused to give me full refund"
Not Verified |  I cancelled 4 business class tickets between Lisbon to Boston within 24 hours of booking, they refused to give me full refund by deducting 400 euros for each ticket. I complained to TAP twice as their refund policy clearly stated 24 hours full refund. They still refused full refund by saying I paid Euro (I actually paid with my US credit card). Can't believe they don't endorse their own policy.

### "Complete disaster"
Complete disaster TAP Portugal! Flight was first postponed, then canceled. No organization. Unfriendly staff, no one really wanted to help you, everyone just lied to you to get rid of you. Volle Katastrophe TAP Portugal! Flug wurde zuerst verschoben, dann abgesagt. Keine Organisation. Unfreundliches Personal, keiner wollte dir wirklich helfen, jeder hat dich nur angelogen, damit er dich los ist

### “Staff confiscated my suitcase”
Not Verified | Staff confiscated my suitcase at the gate despite it being under the weight and size limitations. I am very careful to weigh and measure my luggage before I fly. The gate attendant told me she could just "see it is overweight". Upon getting my luggage back at the destination, it was scuffed and scratched almost beyond recognition. Be very careful bringing luggage you care about on this airline as they can confiscate it without cause and handle it however they please.

### "lack of customer service"
I could not be more disgusted with this airline by their lack of competence, lack of customer service and simply not caring. For the past couple of months, it has been one issue or setback or headache after the next. The website/app are both horrendous to navigate and crash. When I called customer service about not being able to access my flight via app they could not resolve the issue. The agents on the phone give you a constant loop of bogus excuses and promises that result in no progress. Today, I am supposed to be leaving for an international flight with this airline, but to no avail. A few days ago- I received a flurry of e-mails from TAP stating they cancelled and refunded my flight. This is days before my flight and naturally I feel a wave of panic. For three days straight I called customer service constantly. I asked for answers as to why and how this happened without my approval. No success! I pleaded with them as they showed no sense of urgency. Meanwhile my  trip to Europe is riding on this flight. They kept feeding me false promises and nonsense. I demanded to speak to a supervisor who could fix this - of course I was declined. They kept trying to contact the “back office” to resolve this case.. but nobody answered. I was absolutely livid, frustrated and thoroughly displeased with this horrid booking and customer service experience.

### "I will never fly TAP again"
The flight attendants and gate agents were all very sweet and helpful. Food, comfort and were good. Unfortunately the TAP website and app are a nightmare. We had to call to buy tickets because the website wouldn’t put our payment through. No updates about delays, gate changes or boarding announcements are ever texted or emailed. When trying to buy a checked bag on the way home, I received an error that the payment didn’t go through, yet they emailed a receipt and took the money out still. Then there was trouble getting the luggage tag printed and they ultimately didn’t load it on the plane and it’s now lost in Germany. I will never fly TAP again.

### "worst airline I have ever flown"
Quite definitely the worst airline I have ever flown. Forget delays, long bus boarding, chaotic hoarding procedures etc. Many airlines have just as bad reputations as TAP. What disgusts me most is the onboard experience. TAP provides one of the most restrictive legroom and seat space in the world. At a mere 28cm, you simply can't have your kegs straight in the seat. How they get away with this is astonishing. It can seriously hurt your legs and blood flow (I'm 1,83cm so not that tall). Due to Lisbon's location, most of their European flight still be over two hours. And it's two hours of hell. I swore when I flew to Cape Verde with them about five years ago that I would never fly again with them but had no choice for this flight. I came to regret it the minute I entered the cabin again. The staff onboard is ok but the food offerings they sell are extremely limited and very unappetising. I didn't see many people purchase anything. But it's all really about the lack of comfort in your seat. That's what it's all about. And the flights were nearly 500 euro return so astonishingly bad value for what you pay. Even low cost carriers have more leg room.

### "new cabin is super comfortable"
Probably my favourite airline to fly Transatlantic flights. The new cabin is super comfortable and the food was great (we were served a full dinner on a flight departing at 11pm). Never encountered an issue with TAP and in my experience they are more reliable and comfortable than Air Canada, KLM, etc.

### “No welcome drinks or snacks offered”
8 hours flight across the Atlantic on a narrow body flying in business class. No welcome drinks or snacks offered, there is a note on the paper menu, saying that if you want a drink, you should ask the cabin crew. After takeoff we got served a full meal of acceptable quality, and then the cabin crew asked to close the blinds, even though it was 14:00, to allow the passengers to sleep, and only came back 1:30 before landing for a light snack, of a unimpressive quality. The seat was all right and the inflight entertainment also acceptable.

### "worst airline I have ever booked"
This airline is the worst airline I have ever booked. A shame really because the flight itself was great. The problem was the booking. They didn't give me the flight I booked (I went through customer service chat). Once I noticed I wrote an email, a website inquiry and an instagram message yet they wanted to charge me $1200 to change the flight to what I had booked. Massive mistake on their side. On the way back they canceled my flight and then put me on a flight on Friday, only to find out they screwed up again and put it on a Thursday. They then claimed I missed my flight when I had screenshots of all communications. They deleted the messages on the chat but I have copies. I will be pursing this airline to the highest extent. They wasted a whole day of me calling, chatting, texting. Do not fly with them.

### “This was most infuriating”
I paid good money for an economy plus (a few centimetres extra) seat because of a previous injury. However, the seat did not extend all the way back, thus not getting the extra space on a night flight. (8.30 hours) the steward said there was a seat in economy. Because I was travelling with my partner this did not sound like a solution but more like downgrade. The steward said to contact the customer service for a refund after the flight. I did this in hope to get a refund or compensation. I explained the whole situation and the response of Anna Pflieger was like she wasn't even reading the mail but just typing (copy/paste) standarized sentences and not answering any of my questions. This was most infuriating. Example: Thank you for contacting TAP Air Portugal. We are sorry for the situation you reported. Please do not hesitate to contact us whenever you consider it relevant. We look forward to welcoming you on board soon. Yours sincerely, TFCP - Anna Pflieger Never flying TAP Portugal ever again.

### "very disappointing and frustrating"
Not Verified |  Very poor customer service and complaint dept is also unresponsive. We had to cancel within 24 hours after booking, I contacted the customer to understand the refund procedure and I was told they would refund 100%. However, I only received 10% of the payment. I contacted them again, and they further explained that I should have chosen to receive it via voucher. Since then I have trying to contact them for 2 weeks and the customer service asked me to raise another and another complaint, but they never reply. This is very disappointing and frustrating.

### "expensive ticket for a low cost service"
I paid around 1450 Euros for a return ticket from Vienna to Sao Paulo, total of 4 sectors. The shorter sectors, between Lisbon and Vienna, nothing was served. Just water was "free". The seats were very bad with no possibility to recline not even for 5°. During the long haul sectors, the service was existing but very poor. Poor selection of beverages and the crew more concerned about reading books than actually doing their job. Cabin was extremely cold and the entertainment system was working partially ... sometimes on and off. It was a very expensive ticket for a low cost service.

### "not an airline I will consider"
The problem here was with booking. I was charged $250 for one normal checked bag each for my wife and I, only to find that they were charging me that just for one direction, and that that I would need to pay again for the return flight, despite that the web page said it was 'from Boston to Boston'. The US has a 24 hour rule that allows cancellation with no penalties of any flight reservation within 24 hours. After failed attempts to cancel on the Web and at least 10 phone disconnects, I was able to get an email that I requested a cancellation. They did not notify me that the flight was actually cancelled, so I checked the status of my cancellation today and it said a refund had been issued, but failed to say that they were keeping $250 (not legal in the US). The only way for me to know this to search my credit card activity on the Web. Hopefully my filing a dispute with my credit card will get me the full refund. Definitely not an airline I will consider for the future.

### "will never fly with them again"
Worst airline ever. I saw the yelling at passengers for taking pictures in the cabin and removing someone else’s blanket from their over their head so that they would pay attention. In my case I was coerced into paying for my carry on which met the weight and size requirement. It even went in the cabin with me. Then when you file a complaint they don’t have call center so no one can take your call. All they say is that it can take months for someone to handle your case. I will never fly with them again. Then my entertainment center wasn’t working properly. When I told flight attendant, she hit it and kept going. It then stopped working again.

### "a very uncomfortable situation"
In their brand new A339, TAP allocated 2 toilets to Business Class passengers. One in the front part of the cabin, one in the back, between Economy and Business (there is however a second one in the back, but it is for ECO passengers). Both toilets occupancy (green or red) are on display. This should theoretically be enough. However on this specific flight we faced a very uncomfortable situation: no toilet. For one reason only: chief purse decided 1to not prevent Economy pax to access Business class backwards toilet (which is usually done stretching a tape) . This resulted in long Economy pax queuing in the center galley. To limit access to front toilet, and galley, as a private zone for her and crew, even when green light was on. All pax started to comment, even with crew, who agreed with us, but do to staff hierarchy confessed their inability to solve.

### "I was pleased with the level of service"
My family and I were traveling on TAP from Amsterdam to JFK, with a transfer in Lisbon. Our flight was delayed on tarmac for takeoff from Amsterdam. By the time we landed in Lisbon there was 20 minutes until our connection. I knew we would never make it because in Lisbon there is a chance you have to take a transfer bus to your connecting gate (which is fine in most circumstances but is tough with a tight connection). But when we exited the stairs from the plane there was man waiting for us with a JFK sign and he whisked us off to a building where there were staff waiting to direct us through passport control. And then after we went through there were more TAP staff directing us back to the man with the van who drove us to the tarmac where our plane was still waiting for us. Not only was that level of our bags made it onto the flight to go home with us. To say I was pleased with the level of service TAP provided is an understatement. I would eagerly fly with them again and would encourage others to do the same.

### "This airline was very good"
Not Verified |  From the moment we checked in at Heathrow to the moment we got back a week later it was flawless. Perfect service, food, timings no lost luggage which we put on at Heathrow and did not have to collect it again until the final destination. The aircraft were modern and well equipped. My only complaint is on the A320 for the short flight, the leg room was poor but I guess you get what you pay for. My advice is when you fly with TAP like any other airline make sure you read the baggage rules, they are straightforward and simple but may differ from other airlines. The hassle I saw other customers having was because they had got it wrong and were trying to blame TAP and the customers were being unnecessarily rude! This airline was very good.

### "Worst ever experience"
Not Verified | Worst ever experience with an airline. 4 delayed planes, 2 missed connections. Making us run to catch the next connection. Complained and no reply, Avoid!

### "Avoid them at all costs"
Avoid them at all costs. We had the worst travel experience of our lives with them over 2 years ago, in November 2021. Our flight to Toronto got diverted to Montreal because they didn't have enough fuel on their plane to make it to Toronto. The pilot eventually timed out while we waited 3 hours for refueling on the Montreal runway. 7 hours later they finally had us to a hotel (at 4am). They were unreachable by phone, and had no flight to get us home to Toronto. The refused to fly us standy on another airline. They wanted the whole flight to go together but they now had no crew. 36 hours later we finally had to take a bus home. Absolute nightmare. 2 years later and we still don't have the refund and compensation we are entitled to. They're unreachable by phone and email and have abysmal customer service. Absolutely avoid at all costs, unless you want to be stranded in a city that wasn't the destination you paid for.

### “I’ve forgotten how bad it was”
I’ve forgotten how bad it was before and after many years not flying with them hoping that things have changed! They didn’t. Ground force at Gatwick airport very limited (took me over ONE HOUR to dispatch a suitcase! Detail: I had 10/11 people ahead of me! Flight was meant to depart at 10:15 and at 08:36 I got a message saying that my flight was expected to depart at 11:35 (1:20 minutes late… so far). A classic from this poor company. Never again!

### “had the most stressful experience”
This airline is terrible. I fly quite often and stuff happens. Today stuff happened to me. In the past I have been able to contact an airline and at least move the flights for a fee which I could reclaim from my insurance. TAP Portugal did not have ANY representatives at Manchester airport, so there was nobody to even begin a discussion with. I got caught in a road closure - totally not the airline's fault - but read the fine print because they will not help you when there is trouble, they will say they have your money and owe you nothing. They also have a ludicrous policy of cancelling your return flight if you miss your outgoing flight, which makes no sense whatsoever. I have had the most stressful experience with this airline, I would never even try to fly with them again. Thank goodness for travel insurance!

### "worst airline I’ve ever flown"
Quite easily the worst airline I’ve ever flown with. I had two flights with TAP and both flights were delayed. The second leg (Lisbon - Toronto) was close to 3 hours delayed. We started boarding and 10 minutes into the process, boarding stopped. No one told us what was going on. We were stuck in between the gate and the plane for almost 20 minutes until we learned from fellow passengers that we had the option to either wait in the gate or de-board and go back to the waiting area. There was 0 communication from the staff about anything; we only knew about updates from other passengers or by directly asking the ground staff. The ground staff at Lisbon airport were extremely rude, constantly displaying deplorable behavior towards passengers. To make matters worse, the airline decided to leave all checked-in baggage behind in Lisbon — all 150+ passenger baggage, including the crew’s. We didn’t find out about this until the captain made an announcement as we were taking off. Even the excuse they gave for leaving all baggage behind seemed disingenuous; I wouldn’t be surprised if they were lying. This meant that hundreds of passengers had to go to a tiny lost and found desk at Pearson Airport past midnight to make a claim to get their bags delivered home. I ended up getting my bag tagged incorrectly which means I almost lost my bag for good — it was a miracle I got it back. And I only got it back because I went to the courier warehouse to find it and pick it up myself SECONDS before it was whisked away on a truck to be delivered who knows where. There was no mention of compensation or anything to make up for the days with no baggage. I am planning to submit a claim to get reimbursed for the essentials I had to buy for the first two days, and while I’m hopeful I’ll get a response and a resolution, I’m not counting on it. I don’t understand how this airline is still in business. I have now made it a point to actively tell others to never even consider flying with this airline. TAP, get your act together.

### "WORST airline in existence"
Not Verified | I was SUPPOSED to go Marrakech December 1-8, but am I there? No, I am not because TAP is the WORST airline in existence. Do not be seduced by their low airfares; they are low because they are terrible and will thieve from you. Trustpilot rating 1.2, an "F" rating on Better Business Bureau and oh...a November 2022 consent decree and fine (not a large enough one!) by the US Department of Transportation for "deceptive" business practices and continually refusing to refund or massively delaying refunds when they were due. NONE OF THIS BEHAVIOR HAS CHANGED SINCE THEN. Google it - you can see exactly what I'm talking about. There are recent reviews after recent reviews on multiple websites about this. I purchased tickets back in April for two different trips: Marrakech via Lisbon 12/1/23-12/8/23 and Rome via Lisbon 1/10/24-1/17/24. In October, I got a scheduling change notification for Marrakech. My outbound transatlantic flight was moved up 2 hours (inconvenient but doable) my homebound transatlantic flight was moved up 4h55m and now leaves BEFORE my connecting/originating flight from Marrakech even lands in Lisbon! Contrary to what their (buggy) website says, there was NO link in my email notification allowing me to make an edit to reservation. I had to call in. The background noise in the service center is terrible; oftentimes you have to YELL to be heard. Some of their agents have less grasp of the English language than they should given that they need to service English language speakers. No one you talk with has any ability to assist you - they keep directing you to their poor website. I was told by the agent that they could try to rebook me given the major schedule change - one that AGAIN is now impossible to actually do. Except they couldn't; and I got zero communication from them that they couldn't. I called back, and was told there were no other direct flights from Lisbon to Chicago same day. They also refused to just let me stay the night in Lisbon and try the next direct the following day- saying I was "booked as a connection". What they wanted me to do was stay an extra day in Marrakech, fly to Lisbon, STAY OVERNIGHT, then leave the next day. So two whole extra days! And what about the whole "you were booked as a connection"?! I declined because that's ridiculous. Per US DOT regulations, that entitles me to a FULL refund because of their craziness. The wanted to charge me $45 to do the refund over the phone instead of on their website. Their website that doesn't have an option to describe my scenario. It wasn't an outright cancelation, but it was also not anything voluntary on my part. I was directed to choose my flight was canceled. I did so, and then they only refunded me the taxes saying "I canceled before they did" and "the change was under 5 hours". WTF?! It does not matter if the change was UnDeR fIvE hOuRs because the flight out of Lisbon leaves before my flight from Marrakech even gets there! The journey is literally, physically impossible to complete! I have called and spent HOURS on the phone with increasingly stupider people. I have filed multiple complaints including with the US DOT. I requested a charge back with my credit card company. After the mountain of evidence I supplied my credit card company, they reversed the remaining charge. Do you know how hard it is to convince your credit card company that a charge should legitimately be reversed?

### "had to check my carry-on,%"
On my flight back from Lisbon to Miami, TAP Portugal personnel made me check my carry-on luggage at the gate despite my carry-on's weight was 10.0 Kg. They said because my back pack had 4Kg. I had to check my carry-on, for Euros 125.00, where is the logic on this. If I had 2 extra Kgs, charge me for 2kg. I have flown 8 times with TAP in the last 13 month but If this is the way TAP conducts business, I will never fly TAP again.

### "TAP Portugal is the worst airline"
TAP Portugal is the worst airline with horrendous customer service. We booked a flight directly on Tap's website. We received the confirmation. We then called to add an in-cabin pet and were informed that our ticket was actually not approved. WHAT? We paid, and had a confirmation, please explain. I was informed that their site provided the wrong price because price fluctuates as passengers book tickets. So, although you think you're looking at pricing and flights available, it's incorrect so they don't actually finalize your ticket. However, you would never know. You don't get an email. There is no alert. Look at reviews and you see evidence of this...people needing to pay more when they get to the gate. Luckily I found out because I happened to call about needing to add something. The agent informs me that they only way to confirm my return flight is to pay an additional $900!!! Or they can 'refund' me (it was a non-refundable ticket) just the return flight. They will not refund me the entire ticket even though this is a TAP Portugal  glitch. My daughter booked her return flight to mimic our flight and her ticket is also invalid. She has to pay additional money as well. They say there is no other remedy. This is the WORST customer service ever. How is it a customers fault that their website has incorrect pricing? How is it possible that they lock you into a flight because you think it's what is listed, only to find out half of the ticket it incorrect. There is no remedy but to pay $900 extra.

### "performing like a low cost carrier"
Pricing of a full service Airline, performing like a low cost carrier. Seats were extremely close together and the backrests cannot be adjusted - they bought new airplanes with the worst possible interior. On a 3,5 hours flight was not even water offered besides the sales offerings. The staff preferred to play with their mobiles than taking care of the passengers

### “Professional, helpful cabin crew”
Very comfortable, silent and with appropriate dimmed lightning for passengers to be able to sleep. Professional, helpful cabin crew. Usually on time but at 4:25 am there really is no traffic.

### "left very late and was nearly empty"
Old plane did not make the mistake to pay upgrade to business class because it was not worth it. Plane left very late and was nearly empty, so in all had a very good flight experience due to be almost alone in the flight. The staff was amazing, and the flight attendant that was with us was fantastic. Hope no more flights in this very old plane with next to none entertainment.

### "a worn out plane"
Very good experience in Business class only due to the staff, the plane is old the IFE is dated and very old movies, it is a worn out plane, left late and did not manage in flight to make up for the time. In all paid for the full experience and did not get it all. Will see again if plane is new or old to book the class to fly

### "Not recommended at all"
Not Verified |  Lisbon airport is a mess but the TAP service is even more terrible. Our one carry on for two passengers was move to hold, which of course cost us another extra hour at arrivals. On the incoming flight to Lisbon we flew business class but not some of the drinks ordered was never delivered. That ticket cost us 4 times the regular price but experience was as in economy. Not recommended at all.

### "one of the worst airline experiences"
This is one of the worst airline experiences I’ve recently had. -Business class feels old, very worn cabin , seats not spacious, feels overcrowded. Lounge in Lisbon is in top 3 worst I’ve been too. Lisbon airport is absolute madness. The one good thing was that the staff was very polite and the food was pretty good.

### "$108 each way for an overweight carry on"
Worse airline ever. Charged me $108 each way for an overweight carry on. That’s a ripoff, never again with this airline How can I travel international with a carry on and be charged.

### "stuck overnight in Lisbon"
This was the most horrible flying experience I’ve ever had. Initially we missed our connecting flight due to TAP being late causing us to get stuck overnight in Lisbon. Then we had to be flown down to Miami the next day to catch a connecting flight to our final destination in Jacksonville and they caused us to miss that flight too! The flight itself was terrible as well. It was a 9 hours flight and the seats are TINY and uncomfortable. They fed us twice, once about an hour into the flight and they didn’t come around again until we had about an hour left! No drinks or snacks between meals!! I had to get up and ask for some water and the “cups” they give you are teeny tiny mouthwash cups with a SIP of water. I also got zero meal options because by the time they got to me they were out of options and I just had to take what they had leftover. This happened with drinks during the second meal as well. Idk how this happens when they are literally only handing out SIPS of drink. The flight attendants are also not friendly at all. We flew into Europe on United and maybe they spoiled us because that was an amazing experience in comparison to TAP Portugal!! !

### "I wouldn’t fly again with TAP Portugal"
This was the first time an airline was checking my hand luggage weight. They ask for 125 euros with no reason. When I was in Amsterdam the guys at the desk told me my luggage is fine but in Lisbon they told me it’s to heavy. After I payed the price I just went normal to the flight with the same luggage. This is after I paid extra for the seats and the flight is half empty. I wouldn’t fly again with TAP Portugal.

### "still waiting for a refund"
The worst experience we've ever had on an airline. We checked in our baggage, went to board the flight but everyone was stopped in the stairwell and told to wait. We waited for over 2 hours in the hot stairwell and were told we had to wait there and couldn't go back into the terminal. After 2 hours they told us the flight was cancelled and got us to go collect baggage and visit the helpdesk to find out what next. Everyone on the flight was queuing for 3 hours in total to be told that the flight wasn't cancelled and to just wait. We waited a total of 9 hours in the airport to be told the flight wasn't going ahead that day and we would need to wait until the next day. We were up at 4:00am the next day to get the first flight and all the passengers on connecting flights had missed their flights. We travelled in September 2022 and we are still waiting for a refund of our trip 14 months later despite doing everything they requested (and they make it very difficult). Avoid at all costs - someone told me the airline TAP, should stand for "take another plane". Not wrong!

### TAP Portugal customer review
We love Portugal but their airline sucks! This was our 3rd visit to Portugal, first time on TAP. Their system assigned us the worst seats so when we tried to change them there was an extra charge per seat. It did it both ways! On our way back their employee stopped us to weigh our carry-ons and bags together which was odd because USA airlines don’t weigh your backpacks or purses. My husband’s weighed 5 pounds more. From Miami to Lisbon there was no extra charge but on our way back we had to pay $125 more! Service was ok, food was ok but small portions. We will not recommend TAP to anyone!

### "I won't fly with TAP again"
TAP has a strict, but inconsistently applied, policy on the weight of cabin baggage. On my flight from Lisbon to JFK they made customers weight their cabin bag + personal item right at the departure gate. If over the weight limit they required a bag to be gate checked. No big problem with that. The unconscionable part was being made to pay 125 euros for that gate check It felt like extortion since my only other option would have been to leave some of my possessions behind. On my flight into Lisbon from JFK ten days earlier there was no weighing and, obviously, no charge. My Economy Plus fare entitled me no charge for normal checked baggage. A couple of other cheapo observations. In Economy Plus they serve wine & coffee in paper cups. They provide no personal amenities, like earplugs, eye mask or booties which are normal in Economy on other airlines. How much do they really save by penny pinching policies that give customers a low grade experience? Fairly comfortable seats, OK food and good entertainment choices don't make up for the bad taste. I won't fly with TAP again.

### "the worst flagship airline in Europe"
TAP has become likely the worst flagship airline in Europe. Their level of service is below ultra low cost, it's pitiful. Planes are dated, legroom is terrible, inflight entertainment and services are laughable. Ancillaries are overpriced. It's a joke of an airline. Portugal should be ashamed.

### "genuinely accommodating crew"
Very charismatic and genuinely accommodating crew. Unfortunately, on this route, their prices are consistently and veritably higher. 25F was a seat with premium legroom on an emergency exit.

### "not how you treat customers"
We booked a flight from Frankfurt to Tangier with a connecting flight in Lisbon. We arrived late and missed our connecting flight. When me and my wife arrived at Lisbon airport the TAP customer service informed us about our rights and that we will receive full compensation for any incurred expenses for the day of departure. We arrived at midnight in Lisbon and were informed by TAP customer service that we have to book a hotel for the night 20.09 - 21.09 instead of providing us an accommodation. All of the hotels in Lisbon during that night were sold out and it took us 2h of phone calls until we finally received a confirmation for the booking of the accommodation. It cost us a lot of money and stress to find an overnight stay because TAP booked us another flight on the next day. When we submitted the expenses they refuse to refund any invoice or compensate us according to EU 261/2004. This is not how you treat customers in which you apologize that you made a mistake and then refuse to compensate. I find it also very challenging to tell your customer in a foreign country to search for a hotel when you arrive at 12 midnight and the other option would have been to sleep on the floor at the airport.

### "checked only a few peoples bags"
Not Verified |  They checked only a few peoples bags and let go people whose bags weighed more than ours. After we paid a charge of $134 they packed up the machine and left.

### "downsize your carry on"
Flights were delayed almost every time boarding was like a mystery when it came to starting the process. And when coming back after them not weighing carryons for any inbound flight and within Europe flights, they enclose the gate with this barrier and you have to get in this line at least an hour and a half before departure and they railroad you to this weighing station where you realize that they have dropped the weight from the 10 kilos announced on their website to 8 kilos and they make you put your personal item on there to make sure you go over the "new allowance" and then inform you it's 125 euro a pop (no american Express). So if you see that barrier make sure before you go online downsize your carry on and if you are travelling with someone have that person hold some items and then hand them to you over that barrier after weigh in, if you want to avoid getting mugged or on your flight back home just check in that bag at half the price or avoid this airline altogether

### "trash customer experience"
They didn’t weigh any carry-ons on any flight until the very final return flight home at which point they make every passenger go through a weigh-in at the gate and charge $265 for an over-weight carry-on. Their weight limit is 12kg for both personal item and carry-on combo. Absolute joke of an airline, trash customer experience, recommend avoiding at all costs.

### "experience is absolutely abhorrent"
The experience with the airline is absolutely abhorrent. Not only was the first connecting flight delayed with no proper communication, they lost my baggage on the second flight. Like many of the reviews written, they simply do not care. There is no ground staff to seek help from at the airport, only a tiny signboard at their designated counter that tells you to submit your baggage loss reports online. Once you submit your report online, they do not update you nor contact you about anything. My baggage was delivered 3 days later to the hotel, no calls, no texts, no emails regarding the delivery. They simply quietly left it there and had the hotel staff not known I lost my baggage, they wouldn't have asked me if it was mine when I walked past the reception. When I asked for help to submit claims for the delay of the baggage, I could not find anything on their website, no international toll free line, no online support, they do not reply emails, and the only channel you can write to is FB messenger. It took them 1 week to reply me with a link to submit a loss report / complaint, to my horror the link does not work. You go into a complaint section of their website but it does not allow you to click "next" to actually submit a complain. When you register for a client account as requested, Singapore is not considered a country and neither is Germany nor Portugal, and you simply cannot register an account to lodge a complain or submit any claims. When I posted my experience, multiple friends of mine wrote to me in private reporting similar or worse experiences with the airlines. The experience is absolutely abhorrent and this is an airline you should avoid at all cost.

### "they do not care"
Not Verified |  Flight was ok, but lost our luggage and since reporting at the airport lost and found we have heard nothing. No phone lines answer for baggage service and customer says they cannot help! It has been 10 days and only an online form to fill out with missing items but no confirmation of receipt despite repeated requests This would not happen on a US domestic carrier - they do not care.

### " old plane and no willingness to work"
Flight operated by another company that felt strange. First the flight was over 90 minutes late and the crew seemed somewhat out and tired of doing the flight. Again the remote stand in Lisbon is a big problem for people on a tight schedule. Otherwise old plane and no willingness to work.

### "superb attention of the TAP transit team"
Not Verified |  Having arrived late from Miami to Lisbon and missing a connection to Manchester UK, my wife and I did not know what to do, but thanks to the superb attention of the TAP transit team, in particular Lucas Silvestre, we were successfully booked on a midday flight. Mr Silvestre was simply superb in his service and support! He spent over an hour making the changes and then personally walked us through passport control and boarding, right onto the bus taking us to the plane! His outstanding care and support deserve the highest commendation as a top exemplar of the quality staff and support one may find flying TAP.

### "Will not be using TAP again"
Not Verified |  An hour late leaving. Cabin bags removed to hold at boarding. Result- long delay at baggage reclaim with a train connection to catch. Duty free cigarettes taken from luggage after It was put in the hold or on the way to reclaim in London. Wherever it happened, would not have happened if the original booking for cabin baggage was honoured. We would have had complete oversight of our bag. Will not be using TAP again

### "service was horrible"
Not Verified | This was the worst flight I have ever flown on!! The service was horrible the attitudes were horrible and the food and lack of services was atrocious! The food was terrible. They offered one glass of wine for a 7 hour flight to Boston. They offered 2 Dixie cups of water for 7 hours!

### "Service was unacceptable"
Service was unacceptable, especially for 1st class. No service or even water until 20 min after take-off. They should inform passengers of limited service especially for 7+ hour flight. Paid for 1st class. No priority baggage?

### "Nice flight with no problems"
Nice flight with no problems, left a little late but managed to gain time in flight so arrived borderline on time. Flight attendants very friendly and also helpful finally one flight with bridge in and out. Good value for money

### "Don’t ever book with this airline"
Terrible customer service. I will never book with them again. I have a flight booked for February 2024 and when I needed to make a change on my reservation the customer service agent lied to me costing me $700+ dollars. When my flight was rebooked I was charged twice for my bags and seats. When I tried to fix this mistake customer service gave me the run around and eventually hang up on me. I filled 3 online complaints and never had my issue resolved. Called again and finally got someone who did not hang up on me. However, he told me he would charge me one 45 euro fee to get my $700 back and then charged me the fee 4 times (180 euros). I have now filed 2 further online complaints to get my money back on unfair fees and still no response. I started this process in April of 2023. Don’t ever book with this airline.

### "Never flying TAP again"
Not Verified |  Terrible! Never flying TAP again. Customer service reps at the front desk are terrible and completely unfair. Representative at the front desk did not allow me to pass through with my carryon and made me check my bag. However, a-couple right after me has the same size carryon, slightly bigger actually and allowed them to pass without checking their carryon. They were Portuguese and was all smiles vs me, not Portuguese and did not speak any Portuguese. Extremely arrogant, rude and major attitude. I asked for manager and she said there is no manager. What kind of airline doesn’t have a manager? I will pay whatever additional amount to not fly TAP ever again.

### "Incredibly horrible"
Not Verified |  Where can I start. From the rep changing our seats and separating our group to wet floor on the plane to rude employees at Lisbon airport, nothing on this airline is good. Incredibly horrible. Absolutely worthless.

### "most disorganized airline"
Not Verified | I have never flown TAP before and never will again. It was literally the most disorganized airline and airport. Last minute everything. Bags that complied with size and weight at check in were removed at the gate holding up the line. People were not pulled aside to do this, everyone in line had to wait while baggage was tagged. The Portugal airport was worse. We had a connecting flight and still had to go through security with 300 other people in the snake lines. So many people were jumping the lines security had to be called. Connectors should be rerouted to their next gate. At the gate was another line to show passports again, then there was a gate change and once again; another line of waiting customers. Then an hour wait on the tarmac for clearance! Food was horrible and unidentified, I had no idea what I was served. I did get a free glass of wine and the duty free area was clean and comfortable. I have wanted to visit Portugal but this has changed my mind!

### "They chose the most ruthless way"
We had a slight emergency which caused us to get to our boarding gate 20 minutes before the plane was scheduled to depart. We were told that the gate closed 30 mins before departure and they couldn't do anything for us. It was a very resolute and cold approach without considering our situation and trying to help in any way. The plane was still on the ground and it would take 5-10 minutes max to get us in. We were directed to go to the TAP counter and re-book our flight. As if not being able to get on our scheduled flight wasn't bad enough we were then told that if we wanted to get on the next flight (6 hrs later) it would cost us $4,842 . It was a shock since this one way ticket for three of us was more expensive than our previous round tickets for four of us ($3,530). I felt horrified, very upset, trapped and taken advantage of in a worst way. When we boarded our next flight I couldn't not notice that there were people still coming into the plane 5 minutes before the scheduled departure. So, the question remains as far as why some people can get on the plane at last minute and why we were not able to board the plane 20 minutes before the departure. I could understand if we were charged a small fee for transferring those tickets or the same price of the previous ticket but overcharging us in a situation when we should have been able to get on our original flight was something we definitely didn't expect. They chose the most ruthless way and charged us exorbitant amount of money for the seats which would otherwise be empty. I haven't experienced more coldhearted approach with any other airline in my last 40 years of traveling.

### "will never fly with them again"
Not Verified |  TAP Portugal charged me 165 euros to carry on my bag. This is after me complying with the baggage information provided on their website and showing my baggage to their flight attendants at check in. Their customer service stated that my ticket did not allow any baggage while this is not stated anywhere on my ticket confirmation. TAP Portugal has been totally fraudulent in their representation of baggage allowance and charges. I will never fly with them again.

### "A smooth experience"
Flight left Malaga late because of the amount and size of carry on they bring , it took ages for people to sit and we could go on our way, TAP needs to control better the carry ons, the remote stand keeps being a thing we boarded in remote stand in Malaga but to my surprise fast the transport. A smooth experience with no more issues.

### "need to pay to select a seat"
Overall the flight was okay but unfortunately you need to pay to select a seat even during the check-in or else you will be assigned to a random seat, it's kinda like Ryanair. The legroom wasn't great and my height is average (186cm). Also the flight was 3 hours delayed.

### "One-star experience"
A budget airline hiding behind the facade of a national airline. Never have I been weighed of my hand luggage at the gate with every other passenger. The 11-kg limit is frankly just unrealistic for a carry-on and a personal item combined. TAP, do you know BA does 23 kg for their hand luggage, and they aren’t even much more expensive than you are? And did I mention drinks and snacks are available for purchase only? The Lisbon airport is poorly managed as well: no lounges in the international zone, limited food choices, and not even functioning WiFi available. One-star experience.

### "a very good flight"
Plane on time, boarding was made in gate for the first time in many flights no remote stands, plane full but flight crew managed well the boarding to leave on time, plane not so clean but nothing to bad. In all a very good flight.

### "bad ground support"
The flight left Lisbon airport in a very far remote stand, we were kept in the bus for more then 5 minutes before authorized to board, but boarding on time and doors closed 10 minutes before flight, had to wait for 40 minutes to be airborne so we arrived late and also on remote stand with lots of time to wait for bus. Good flight, bad ground support.

### "Biggest mistake of our life"
According to their own we site, TAP would do everything possible to recover the luggage. But if you talk to them by phone, they don't want to help you. You just have to be patient. Biggest mistake of our life to fly with TAP. Next time just fly with KLM. Our honeymoon has unpleasant consequences thanks to TAP. We are going to hold them liable for all damages according to the European laws and regulations.

### "they failed big time"
Not Verified |  We were supposed to fly with the TAP airlines, unfortunately, two weeks before the flight, a completely difficult health problem arose, two weeks before the flight date, we only asked, in light of the circumstances, to postpone the flight. A week after the planned date, we wrote a letter and explained the situation, we also emphasized that if the price on the new date is higher, we will pay the difference, we didn't ask for a refund, we asked for a postponement, that's it! For over six months we waited patiently for TAP Airlines to look into the issue, in the end we received an answer, they cannot give us an alternative flight, while adhering to the company's regulations, without considering the human side, in this case. There are many airlines companies, in the end they all fly the same planes and reach the same destinations, the difference is in the service, we as consumers are entitled to receive the best service for the money we pay!! Therefore, you, as a passenger, find yourself in a crisis, and you need good service, you need someone who will listen to you, you need someone who understands the problem, you need someone who will consider it carefully in order to give you, the passenger, the best solution, it is very important to choose the airline company correctly. At the TAP airline they failed big time! Be smart, and learn from the experience of others, we will still fly to Portugal, but not with the TAP airlines, that's for sure!

### "worst and most stressful airline"
Never have I had such a bad experience. First of all getting there wasn’t the worst it was a good 3 hr layover and had delays on both flights. This appears to be the norm for tap. Trying to make sure the bags were transfer was impossible in the airport as they had one help service person who served the same people for an hour. The worst is the second flight back layover of only an hour but of course TAP is delayed all the time. First leg 40 min delay, second 15 min. After running through the airport to the gate of course on the other side of the airport we are welcomed by the usual gate people. We asked if the bags would make it with such a short time to unload and load and with a smile we were told maybe or maybe not let hope. With that great boost of confidence we boarded got to the UK eventually. When we managed to get to baggage nothing. Waited for the whole loop and thank god mine came out and another one. Ahh but wait 5 people, 5 suitcase but only 2 there. So somehow 2 out of 5 made it. One has been found in there speedy 48hr window and the other two lost with no update or idea of what’s happening. Oh and calling don’t bother they are still closed with phone line because of Covid, you would think a new excuse would be needed by now. I am fair in my reviews although I have focused on the bad because it is without a doubt the worst and most stressful airline I’ve ever been on I will look at positives. A positive is that snack cart where they charge you a fortune for a chocolate bar about the size of a grape was the fastest services I’ve ever seen. Amazing speedy and lovely smiles. In conclusion if you don’t mind the odd bag going missing, terrible transfer windows, incapable staff and company, but love a fast food cart this is the airline for you. Oh also don’t go business for around the £70 mark extra it’s the same damn seats with a curtain between you and economy plus. We had a plane with screens and a couple was in business, they overbooked and he had to sit in economy. Very poor planning. Just go with anyone but!

### "picked my wife and me to check our carry on bags"
The boarding attendants randomly picked my wife and me to check our carry on bags. They were under the weight limit, so they made us try to put them in a measurement frame, which no real bag would fit. We have used both bags as carry-ons for years with no problems. They charged us 170 euros. We had to board, we could not dispute at the time. The bags were not taken from us for storage, in fact the stewardesse told us to place them in the overhead storage. Then we saw many other larger bags without luggage tags being put in the overheads. Overall staff was rude, on flight meals awful, entertainment devices decades old.

### "cabin crew completely uninterested"
Not Verified | In Faro we checked in 2 pieces of luggage for Vienna. They also wanted to take our hand luggage (trolley) from us, but we refused. In Lisbon we were also allowed to carry our hand luggage (under 10 kg 1 small suitcase for 2 people), but in the next step it was taken from us with the information that the plane was completely full. However, other passengers with large backpacks or the same suitcases were allowed to take their luggage with them. And an Airbus 321neo actually has enough storage space. The big surprise on the plane: the overhead compartment was completely empty (photo see attachment). The even bigger sad surprise: our checked luggage hadn't been taken (so we were glad we had insisted on taking it on the plane, at least in Faro). And it's still not here after 3 days. Thank you TAP for this masterpiece, which is also reflected in the cabin crew, who were completely uninterested in the passengers and didn't even ask if they wanted a glass of water. One thing is for sure: never again TAP.

### "frustrated and disappointed"
I was traveling from Israel to Brazil. I was informed that I could only check in at the airport, so I followed this guidance. When I arrived, I found out that my ticket was blocked. The attendants couldn't help because they were clueless. They also couldn't explain the reason for the blockage. I had to call the central office in Portugal and spent an hour on the phone sorting out the company's mess. Moreover, since it was an international call, I had to pay an exorbitant fee to the service provider. All of this happened right before boarding, and I almost missed my flight. TAP has still not provided any response as to why they blocked my ticket and put me through this situation. Apart from causing immense stress by almost missing a flight from such a distant place, I also had to bear the cost of an international call to resolve this problem that they invented and made so complex to solve. In total, it took 1.5 hours to resolve this issue. I am extremely frustrated and disappointed. The level of incompetence of the company is very high. I do not recommend this airline to anyone!

### "TAP now works as a low cost carrier"
TAP now works as a low cost carrier charging everything extra, so luggage, meals, everything. At most you receive a small chocolate and a glass of water. But, you payed for a flag carrier flight. About the personal they are the most professional people and I admire them.

### "This is no better than Ryanair"
A flagship company weighing personal hand bags and charging 100 euros per weight excess. This is no better than Ryanair. At least the low cost airlines announce all hand luggage maximum weight, TAP doesn’t communicate that the personal hand item/backpack has a limit of 5kg. Be aware!

### "refused to refund my money"
Words cannot explain how angry I am at TAP Air Portugal. I, an Australian citizen, booked my Moroccan partner flights to Brazil transiting airside in Lisbon and they denied him boarding, saying he needed a "transit visa" for the Schengen Area. This is a lie: the Portuguese Government and European Union do not require Moroccan citizens to have a transit visa for airside transit in any Schengen Airport. I provided official evidence of this from the source, multiple times across multiple complaints and requests for refund; they don't care, keep parroting about the "fare rules", and have refused to refund my money for these flights. This is despite EU261 stating that we should have been entitled to not only a refund, but also compensation.

### "Boarding flight in remote stand"
Boarding flight in remote stand seems to be a thing in TAP, it is so uncomfortable to do so but they just keep at it. The flight was delayed by 30 minutes but they gave me an free upgrade to business class. In all good value for money

### "think more low budget"
If you go into your travel with the airline with low expectations, you should be ok with your experience. It should not be regarded as anything resembling a first tier airline - think more low budget, pay for everything kind of airline. We paid to upgrade seats to what was billed as "premium" but were exactly the same quality as the ones in which we were originally booked. We also paid for priority boarding, but because the airline doesn't want to pay the fees required to park at an actual gate, we had to take a bus from the terminal to the plane. This had the effect of absolutely cancelling any benefit to "priority" boarding. If you have to take this airline, you'll probably get there ok. But if you're used to flying with a more customer service-oriented airline, this isn't the one.

### "This company is a scam!"
Not Verified |  This company is a scam! I paid more money for a flexible ticket to be able to change my flight without paying penalties and when I tried to call them they asked me for £200 for no reason and without upgrade!

### "by far the worst airline"
Not Verified |  TAP Portugal was by far the worst airline. You can't really get hold of them on the phone because you wait for hours in the line. At the airport, the tried for about one hour to add my surfboard (which you have to pay extra for) to the flight. At that point, they probably canceled one of my flights because when I wanted to check-in, they told me that my flight got canceled by TAP. Again, no answer on the phone and at the TAP counter, they said, they cant do anything, i have to phone again. So in the end, I had to buy another flight for 600 euros and I got still no answer from TAP.

### "I am still pending a refund"
I am still pending a refund for my delayed flight costs and damaged baggage claim costs. The delayed flight costs and damaged baggage claim costs total out to be $830. All purchases I made to accommodate the delayed flight and damaged luggage were the cheapest options available to me at the time. It's been three weeks since I've filed my delayed flight costs claim. No response yet. My damaged baggage costs claim was denied reimbursement since I'm unable to provide a receipt of the damaged original luggage. A purchase that was made a while ago and something I reasonably no longer have. The high expectations Tap Air Portugal holds of their customers do not match the poor customer service they offer as I was on hold via their customer service phone line for 20 minutes. No answer.

### "a cheap airline and it shows"
For the total quality of this airline, I would give 1 out of 10, but I'll give 3 out of 10 because the flight wasn't totally overpriced. It's simply a cheap airline and it shows. They are very strict with the cabin baggage, checking vigorously at the gate to find people of whom they can squeeze out some extra money. Funnily, they did an announcement, stating that they will check the cabin baggage for the sake of "ensuring a timely departure". Which is obviously the opposite case - it's taking extra time. Who understands this logic ... 3 out of our 4 flights were considerably delayed. The seats are okay but you can't adjust them backwards, they are only in upright position, which got tiresome for my back after some time. There are also no screens in front on the seats, the hours were passing very slowly without any entertainment. They will serve you a cup of water on the flight, but any kind of other beverage and food needs to be paid for. It's a low quality airline, but you will arrive safe at your destination for (relatively) less money. I surely won't recommend this airline directly, but if you consider booking with them, understand what you are getting into. Just buy a ticket if it's your only cheap option.

### "Horrible experience with TAP"
Horrible experience with TAP, Chaotic scene at the gate. The clerk was weighing carry-on luggage and charging if bags were more than 10kg (I have personally never heard of this). Heavy bags (more than 10 kg) needed to be checked at a cost of 165 euros. Absolute extortion and offensive charge. We then boarded a bus that took us to the airplane. Upon arrival, all three buses sat with doors closed for over 30 min in the weltering mid-day sun. If the plane wasn't ready, why take us to it? There was zero communication. We finally boarded in a chaotic fashion as some front-seat passengers boarded from the rear, and vice-versa. Once everyone was settled in, the captain announced that we had missed our departure slot and so we sat there for 45 minutes until cleared to taxi. The flight itself was fine and uneventful, but the passengers were all in a bad mood because of the offensive baggage charges, lack of organization, and poor communication about the delays. I will never fly TAP again.

### "lousy customer service"
Incompetent staff, terrible communication and lousy customer service. They took hours to figure out our plane had an issue, took us back to the terminal claiming we would go in a new plane, but they actually just started putting us in later flights from LIS to MAD. The flight I was put on, was also delayed by 3 hours. All they gave me was a 10 EUR voucher and it has now been 20+ days and still no response from them on compensation. I was supposed to arrive in Madrid at 10AM, I arrived at 8PM. Spent 12+ hours in the Lisbon airport. This caused me to miss my flight home, so I had to buy a new ticket for $1000 USD. They initially offered 250EUR of compensation which is laughable, when I asked for them to cover the cost of the new ticket I had to buy, no response. Being ignored by their customer service team. Terrible airlines, staff is rude, they don't communicate. Avoid at all cost.

### "Very rude, extremely disorganized"
Not Verified |  Very rude, extremely disorganized. Every flight is late. Staff took carry on luggage to check because it was “too big” and plane was “full” (it wasn’t) but 80 % of baggage compartments were empty upon take-off. We flew 2 other flights with same luggage on TAP with no problem on US portion of trip. Only bothered American passengers. Others had larger luggage further back in line and were allowed to carry on up to 3 even though they didn’t have a connection. Airport staff either didn’t speak Portuguese or didn’t want to. Will never fly them again.

### 2Check-in is done in the worst possible way"
Check-in is done in the worst possible way. During the check-in process, I wanted to check what other seats were available and their costs. However, when I clicked on another seat, my initial seat disappeared, and I couldn't get it back. The only option left was to pay at least 25 euros for an available seat. I received a ticket without a seat assignment via email. Four managers were unable to provide a solution to this problem. The customer support couldn't find my booking based on all the information from the incoming emails. One of them even claimed it was a flight by Fly To Sky, despite the registration being done through Tap Portugal, and Fly To Sky doesn't have any collaboration with Tap Portugal, as stated on their website. Only the last manager suggested canceling the registration and starting over. After doing so, another seat became available again. All of this happened after an hour.

### "Their approach is of a thug"
They cancelled the 8th june atr-70 flight on the afternoon to Valencia, putting everyone on the next day 12 pm next Embraer 190 flight to LIS. Said they didn't had protocol with any Valencia hotels so I was made to pay for the hotel that extra night. Until now TAP failed the pay my money back and due compensation. Their approach is of a thug.

### "take another plane"
Not Verified | TAP Portugal stands for ”take another plane” It was the worst experience of any flight I’ve ever taken! From rude check in clerks to even ruder stewardess. If you think you’re getting a good deal on the flight price, don’t worry as they will beat you up on your luggage and you will pay dearly. Internet glitches so you can’t check in online and your bags therefore cost $50.00 more automatically. $130.00 for each bag. Your carry ons better be tiny too. The worst flying experience of all time. Seems like rules can be made up and changed at their whim! Bogus! Never again! !

### "it is looking more and more like a low cost company"
Poor boarding planning. Most passengers were allowed to board carry on luggage, only the last passengers that had reserved seats at the front of the plane and were last to board were asked to leave luggage behind. Passengers were unhappy and when entering the plane we could verify that there were plenty of room available at the overhead compartments. Safety on board was not properly verified. There was one passenger traveling with a big package (painting?) in front of her legs (photo attached). The strict control of the 12 kgs per passenger is absurd and not in line with competition. It is also not enforced in an equal manner, not everyone is forced to pay excess luggage. When possible will avoid flying TAP in the future. Unpredictable application of rules would be the main reason. We never know what will happen. I travel for work and would like some more predictability. I say that with some pain because it is my flag company. Unfortunately it is looking more and more like a low cost company.

### "no way up to par with competitors!
Not Verified | With so many other choices, TAP is in no way up to par with its competitors. Ranging from terrible customer service, unusable and oftentimes broken IT/online services, and wildly ridiculous policies, this airline is far below its competitors. Although its prices are cheap for trans-Atlantic flights, cheaper airlines have offered me better service than TAP. A 2kg weight limit for a personal item and a 12kg total limit on carry-on and personal item being strictly enforced on most flights is a ridiculous policy which delays boarding and leaves passengers stressed and dissatisfied. I have never had problems with my carry-ons, but witnessing so many other passengers arguing for up to an hour prior to boarding because of this policy has been extremely frustrating. The website usually barely works, and the airline has clearly prioritized capitalizing on unsuspecting passengers with sudden fees right before boarding or during check-in to reel them in with low prices only to leave them with no other option but to pay large fees at the gate. This is a common scheme of low cost airlines that I have been all too familiar with, but TAP goes above and beyond with their policies of unfair fees for passengers, leaving them with the option of paying or being stranded. The one thing I enjoyed about TAP was the in-flight service and leg room, which is equivalent or better than it’s competitors. However, if you have the option, fly a different airline even if it means spending 100-200 USD more.

### "try and fly with another airline"
Not Verified |  TAP lost my luggage, made me spend more on clothing, I lost my receipts but still showed them proof that I spent money on my clothing (I had images and dates thanks to snapchat), and I asked for, not joking, 7 months straight trying to talk to someone on the phone, email, social media and they were never any help at all. They denied helping me, did not compensate me at all on anything, and overall, just a bad airline that was not helpful at all and did not provide for me anything really. I had no choice but to check in my luggage, they made me check in my carry-on in the line even when I told them no. If I hadn't checked in my luggage, all of this would have been prevented. If possible, at this point try and fly with another airline but this one, more than likely you will be stuck somewhere in Lisboa with not even underwear to your name figuring it out on your own.

### "made to weigh our bags again"
We were forced to pay €125 and to check in our bags. No exceptions. We unfortunately flew TAP Airlines from Lisbon to NY and it was the worst airline experience I’ve ever had. Before checking our 2 included bags, some employee made us repack everything on the floor. Once done, she had disappeared. Some other employee checked our bags in. After passport Check, which is past the lounges, and general waiting areas, we got to the gate with almost no seats, and were made to weigh our bags again, which now had duty free inside. Since they were all 1 kilo over, due to a bottle, we were forced to pay €125 and forced to check in our two other bags. Great way to end a vacation.

### "The worst experience"
The worst experience me and my family faced just now. All this happened today, July 10. Me, my wife and two kids (6and 3 years old) had a route from Miami to Warsaw through Lisbon. I used TAP Portugal to buy tickets. TAP Portugal connected flights with 50 minutes in Lisbon. When we arrived in Lisbon I found out that gates to my plane to Warsaw closed half an hour before. Therefore it was completely impossible to reach the plane to Warsaw. Instead they gave us new tickets to Warsaw through Vienna with +8 hours. No excuses, nothing. And believe it on not they gave us totally different sits with my kids! They want me to sit my kids 6 and 3 years old separate from their parents. However this is the total lack of skill, irresponsibility. TAP Portugal doesn’t deserve even 1 star.

### "my worst experience with an airline"
This is my worst experience with an airline, the first flight from Frankfurt to Lisbon was so late so I missed the second one, they gave me a new business class ticket that is going 4 hours later to Casablanca but I was going to Fez, while boarding I realised that my seat was in the economy class even though I paid for business (they lied to me, they told me is was a business class seat). The second flight took off very late too. If I can my review will be -10.

### "tried to charge us for seats we already paid for"
It’s a shame that I had an amazing experience in Porto however not with the airline staff checking me in. The young lady was very rude and took the smaller bag that was only 9 kilos and checked it before the bigger bag with 3 kilos overweight. She didn’t give me a bag ticket for the smaller bag. Put it on the belt to go to the cargo. I asked her to wait so I can put other items in the lesser weighting bag and she told me to bad. So unprofessional, how can you take my bag and then ask me to move so I can take items without giving me a ticket. She told me I can pay 130 euros but usually with an airline that would do something like this they would take the total weight. Give you the opportunity to fix your bags but not with the young lady serving me at TAP Portugal. She also tried to charge us for seats we already paid for in advance. Shame to have such a bad taste at the end of my trip. I would come to Portugal again but on a different airline.

### "worst experience I’ve ever had with an airline"
This is probably the worst experience I’ve ever had with an airline. After paying a lot of money for my flights my father and I were treated worse than at any low cost we’ve ever taken. For the first time in my history of flying they made me weigh my hand luggage and backpack? After it was only slightly overweight they very rudely tried to make me pay a very expensive fee and it was only after I set my foot down and continuously insisted that they let me rearrange my things that they allowed me to do so. They also tried to convince my father his bag didn’t fit the required dimensions after he put it in the measuring thing multiple times to prove to them that it did. Overall the customer service was absolutely horrendous and these rules they’ve recently made up don’t make any sense.

### "egregious lapse in basic passenger logistics"
This was an TAP Portugal itinerary with the second leg (Lisbon to Athens) operated by Aegean. At no time up to my departure from Boston was I ever able to get a seat assignment for that Aegean flight, despite contacting both airlines multiple times over several months. When I checked in at the TAP counter in Boston, they could not even issue me a boarding pass for the Aegean flight, but they said I would be able to get one from an Aegean agent at the departure gate in Lisbon. What's strange about this situation is that I booked the ticket directly from TAP on their website and NOT on a third-party site, where one might expect to encounter a difficulty such as this. In Lisbon I was unable to get what I needed from a gate agent, so I had to retrieve my bag from baggage claim, go thru Portugal immigration, find my way to an Aegean counter in the main terminal area, get a seat and a boarding pass, and make my way back through security and to the departure gate, lugging my bag and carry-on the whole way, and all within the time I had left after exiting the first flight. I'm 71, and if I had not been in pretty good shape, I probably would have had a medical incident during this harrowing and upsetting experience. I can't say that either one of these carriers was solely responsible for this egregious lapse in basic passenger logistics.

### "it is all low cost but the price"
The standards in TAP have been going down in the past couple of years but it got to a point where it is all low cost but the price. For starters, I have been flying with them for 12 years and not once has been baggage been weighed. Apparently this has started now. I flew with them in March 2023 and, as always, nobody cared about my hand luggage (I frequently take a trolley and a backpack and a lot of times I've also taken a small ecobag with fragile items I don't want to put in my backpack). My last flight on 24th June 2023 from London Gatwick was different though. The lady who checked my luggage wanted to weigh it so she asked me to put my trolley in the scales and shouted I was over the limit. Highly unprofessional and rude, but then she proceeded to make me even more uncomfortable when she said loudly not one but three times that I was taking 3 items instead of 2 (referring to my ecobag). I was never given an opportunity to take anything out of my suitcase or rearrange my things, instead she took the trolley and asked me to pay £68 straight away. I also noticed there appears to be double standards as the lady on the other counter who was also boarding passengers didn't check any luggage. In addition, the economic crisis seem to be have hit hard as before we used to have a snack on board and now not even a glass of water. I would find this acceptable if I had paid a fair amount for this poor service, but TAP seems to forget that they are overpriced for the quality they are presenting customers with nowadays. Very disappointed and dissatisfied. Will go out of my way to avoid flying with them for the near future.

### "Not a way to treat customers"
Nice flight only a few minutes late, but again, remote stand with time stuck on the bus both times departing and arriving the company keeps getting worse in terms of Silver and Gold members we are stuck for ages in packed buses waiting to get in and waiting also to get out. Not a way to treat customers on my opinion

### "all 4 of us seated all over the new plane"
Not Verified |  I paid an extra $100 for seat upgrades. They changed the plane last minute right before boarding and all of the seats were the exact same. I tried to get my $100 back but they refused stating that I got the seat that I had selected...but all of the seats were the exact same on this new plane. So why did I still get charged for an upgrade and then get refused my money back? They stole my money. I had also selected a seat beside my friend that I was traveling with but they had all 4 of us seated all over the new plane. Very disappointed that I sat for 8 hour by myself plus didn't get my money back for a service I did not get.

### "flight experience very stressful"
Plane left in time arrived sooner then the expected time nice room leg. But TAP keeps insisting in remote stands we were stranded in the bus for more then 10 minutes and makes the flight experience very stressful but made it to arrive in time

### "Baggage never made it"
I flew on Tap Portugal. Our flight was delayed due to air conditioning problems, which made us miss our connecting flight. In order to make wedding, I had to take 2 additional flights to Barcelona. Plus aircraft was extremely hot! Baggage never made it to Barcelona and was returned to my home address a week after I returned from Spain! Tap said they would reimburse us for our trip and still have not and they keep closing our complaint!

### "a whopping 125 euros for 1 kg!"
I was on the flight Malaga to Newark with a connecting flight in Lisbon. After going through security, people tend to purchase things at the airport so I purchased 2 bottled waters and souvenirs. Right before boarding the connecting flight in Lisbon to Newark, some passengers were asked to weigh their carryon selectively: some lucky ones were not asked to weigh their bags and managed to take large items full of souvenirs and alcohol from airport shops and unlucky ones (including myself ) were asked to weight their carry on. My wheeler carry and my computer bag with water bottles and souvenirs that I purchased after boarding the flight from Malaga were 1 kg over 12 kg limit. I was asked to pay a whopping 125 euros for 1 kg! Since not all passengers were asked to weigh their luggage, the practiced seemed inconsistent and unfair. The weighing agent suggested I “left the items”, but I bought the items at the airport after boarding the flight in Malaga! That was pure extortion and absolutely unfair, especially since several passengers with much heavier carryons did not have to weigh their luggage at all.

### "forced to check in my carry in baggage"
Not Verified |  Was forced to check in my carry in baggage even though it fit the requirements and was included in my ticket. Staff is being forced to be this rude to customers.

### "a very chaotic boarding"
Plane left late, we had to take the bus to a very remote stand, we were closed in a bus filled with people before entering the plane for more then 10 minutes, boarding was very long and people were not well managed. In all a very chaotic boarding developed in a smooth flight experience.

### "Avoid this airline"
Not Verified |  Our flight was cancelled and all the organizing after that was a big disaster! We waited a bus for three hours and hotel check in for two hours. TAP Portugal staff was disinterested: no help, no sorry, no information. Avoid this airline.

### "the worst airline I have ever been on"
Not Verified |  This is the worst airline I have ever been on, the employees are all aggressive. I waited nine hours at the airport just for my flight to get canceled. I missed a chance to see the Eiffel Tower and 1000 dollars worth of a night in Paris. Please save yourself the worst day of your life and never ever fly with this airline.

### "no one wants to be cheated out of money"
Not Verified |  There was some good and some frustrating with the airline, however, there is a defining moment which I must share and will keep me from ever flying again with them. I had 2 checked bags. The company deceived me into paying for 3 checked bags even though we only had 2. They simply wouldn’t let me fly unless I paid again. Multiple individuals with the company said we would get refunded after hearing the story. When I reached out and requested the refund, even after providing proof, TAP told me they wouldn’t give a refund. So a company that deceitfully plays games and incurs fraudulent charges and then stands by that, I will never fly with this immoral company again. The only reason one chooses to fly with this company is the lower cost. But in the end, it isn’t lower at all and no one wants to be cheated out of money.

### "still fighting for the refund"
We purchased 1pm flight from Lisbon, Portugal to Seville, Spain (3 tickets cost us 675.45 EUR) which out of three flights available on the 15th June 2023 was the most expensive flight, more than double the price of any of the two other flights. The other two flights at 7.25am and 10.25pm, were inconvenient. On 26 May 2023, TAP airline informed us, via email, of the cancellation of our 1pm flight. We were given options of the two other flights, 7.25am or 10.25pm. 10.25pm flight on the day we were advised of cancellation would cost us around 314 EUR for 3 tickets. The difference in price of 362 EUR was not even mentioned in the TAP email. I am still fighting with the TAP airline for the refund and I would add to the above mentioned amount 50 EUR we charged for the late check in in Seville. Their response when we managed to speak to them on the phone was "Wait for our email, it is still "Under analysis". This "customer ser".

### "what a joke of an airline"
Terrible, terrible airline. We had this flight booked ages ago, night before we get an email advising that this flight has been cancelled and they have re-booked us on a flight the next day! No mention of hotels, compensation etc. We are on a long holiday from Australia so this would mean having to book an extra night in one hotel and losing a nights accommodation at our next one in Lisbon, not to mention losing a days travel. There was a flight earlier in the day with seats available but their system would not let us change to that so we eventually had to cancel our original tickets and I managed to book us on a flight a night earlier, mind you this is whist we are making our way to Milan from San Marino. Luckily we could cancel our hotel near Milan airport and book an extra night in Lisbon at a different hotel to the on were are staying at for a week. We were going Business class as a treat and at the boarding gate the agent who also checked us in at Milan advised us that we would not be getting meals on the flight as we booked too late for them to add meals for us, even though we booked that flight that morning. The agent could have told us this when we checked in and we would have eaten in the lounge but she forgot to tell us! Once on board the crew told us this again. We had to ask if we would be given anything from economy and she came back and told us we could have 3 items from the purchase menu (big of them!). Crew were nice but a bit stand offish when we boarded. We were lucky that one passenger in business class didn't eat so we got their meal which wasn't much but better than nothing. I now know why people in Europe rarely bother paying for Euro business class, it is a joke compared to other airlines. No inflight entertainment and you have to ask the crew for everything like they are doing you a favor! Of course we now have to chase our refund we had to submit even though TAP cancelled our flight. We asked at Lisbon airport and were told we have to submit it online ourselves as they only sell tickets at the airport and there is no one to help you anymore, what a joke of an airline.

### "You cannot choose a seat"
Bad service. TAP charges premium fares and delivers worse service than a low-cost airline. You cannot choose a seat on a long haul flight, even at check in. They gave me a seat in the last row where it did not recline (on a 10h flight). In addition to the fact that its employees are in a bad mood. Pessima servico. A TAP cobra tarifas premiums e entrega servico pior que de empresa low cost. Nao se pode escolher assento de voo long haul NEM NO CHECK IN. Me deram assento na ultima fila onde o mesmo nao reclinava (em um voo de 10h) Pra alem do que seus funcionarios sempre de mau humor.

### "An absolute nightmare"
Not Verified |  An absolute nightmare from the beginning till the end. 8 hours delay on the inbound, 7 hours on the outbound. Missed connecting flights due to sheer incompetence of crew and rude ground staff in Lisbon. Had to pay for hotel room due to very late arrival in Newark and a new ticket for the domestic flight that I had missed. What's more, business class food is horrible and seats are anything but comfortable. I should have trusted the overwhelmingly negative reviews of previous customers and for sure, will never ever again this airline.

### "Poor planning"
Terrible food, didn’t schedule buses for gate to aircraft transfer both directions of travel. Poor planning. Loaded commercial cargo last minute causing over 55 minute push off delay. Are passengers really worth this little?

### "I thought Frontier was bad"
DO NOT FLY TAP Air Portugal. Inexpensive flight NYC-DUB. Carry-ons courtesy checked @ NYC at no charge. Then returning both carry-ons + personal items were weighed and all was overweight. 125€ each to check! We paid for 1 checked bag but they should have weighed all at check-in as checked bag was under. Took out a garbage bag and filled with suitcase items. Left empty suitcase at boarding. No wonder they had multiple police officers at boarding. And I thought Frontier was bad.

### "wanted to charge for cabin luggage"
The flight was late because of traffic that did not allow us to get out of the gate, boarding was very long why??? I am a Gold member they wanted to charge for cabin luggage.

### "The food was miserable"
I bought a late minute ticket due to my original flight being canceled by a competitor airline. They should only have you stewardesses on executive as they are much more empathic. The food was miserable.

### "charge you for carrying personal item"
I have been all over the world and I have flew in a lot of different companies and it is the first time they charge you for carrying personal item. They made a whole set up right at the boarding area, where people would not see or have access, and they brought two scales and they would make the passengers weight their carry-on luggage. When the weight of the carry-on wasn’t enough to charge us a fee, they would make us add our personal purse on top. They would claim it passed 1kg extra (it was showing in lbs weight but I guess it is easier to confuse people using a different number). And from there they asked us of 125 euros on fee. I have never seen in my life any company charging for personal purse weight, or asking to add that weight to the carry on luggage. I asked her many times why she was doing that and she completely ignored my question and would only say “they both passed the weight and you gotta pay a fee”.

### "not recommend this airline"
Not Verified |  I booked a changeable ticket with this airline for my daughter on a 4 leg return ticket. When I sought to change the first leg the change fee was exorbitant. I checked to see how much buying a new ticket for this first leg would be and for the same class of ticket it was less than half of the requested change fee. I then spoke to their customer services who agreed it would be ok that I did this and they would just 'suspend' the first leg of the original ticket leaving the remainder of the ticket available for use. When I came to check in for the second leg I found that they had cancelled the whole ticket. I phoned again and they said I could pay a fee of 250EUR to cover what they now claimed was a 'no-show' and I could then use the rest of the ticket. However, they then said there were no seats available. I then booked separately a ticket for the same flight and when my daughter boarded we found the flight to be over half empty. When I later sought a refund they refused. I would not recommend this airline to anyone and will avoid from now on.

### "the worst airline service"
Not Verified |  Actually the worst airline service I have ever flown I went out of my way to add my review in hopes that people try to stay away from this trash airline. I flew from Miami to Madrid with the same bags I’m flying back with, and for some reason they flag me before I board and now it costs 125€? For a carry on bag that I use for every aircraft in the world and now they wanna charge me 125€? Plus their air service is bad as well

### "TAP should manage the boarding"
Late flight, and of course it got delayed, by almost one hour, TAP does not do a good job in boarding planes, other companies when the flight is full ask people to put their luggage in the cargo, so that people go in faster, the boarding took ages to do because of people carrying their luggage and putting it in the compartments, it takes ages and we might have saved at least more then 20 minuts. They should manage that. The flight went ok and nevertheless good value for money, but TAP should manage the boarding when are late in a different manner because of trollyes.

### "in all good value for money"
Flight on time, arrival on time, the only downside is the parking at the remote stand in Madrid, it takes a lot of time to deboard the plane and is not nice because it was raining, the crew was nice, the plane was new, in all good value for money

### "Staff were friendly"
This was a short flight from Lisbon to Faro (after my previous flight into LIS with TAP needed to be rebooked due to a long delay which would have left me stranded over night in LIS. The boarding was on-time and without problems. They let us wait a long time in the bus though. The plane was modern and roomy. Staff were friendly and efficient. Arrival was on time and deboarding quick and efficient. Seat was comfortable but nothing special.

### "Absolutely shameful"
I boarded on American Flight 460 and was ready to head to Philadelphia. The flight crew was confident I would make the connection and be good to go. Approximately 1 hour into the flight, the Captain came on the speaker and identified this flight had engine issues. Due to the weight provided by the fuel, we had to circle around Phoenix before landing at 15:56. We were deplaned, waited at the gate, and reboarded at approximately 17:15. This ensured there would be ZERO chance to make the connecting flight in Philadelphia onto Lisbon (AA 258). The major issue at play was I booked a separate reservation through TAP Air Portugal, since my final destination of Sao Tome (TMS) was NOT served by American Airlines or any Oneworld partners. I was able to get to Philadelphia around 00:23 (on May 13, 2023); however, this was well beyond the time my connecting flight to Lisbon left (21:20 on May 12, 2023). During this flight, I purchased the $25 Wi-Fi so I could attempt to change my flight from Lisbon to Sao Tome, which departed Lisbon at 11:40 AM on 5/13/23 and arrived in Sao Tome at 17:15 (TP 1531 – Record Locator RLPRH6). This was not possible since neither the Mobile App, nor the website would allow changes. In Philadelphia – American Airlines offered me a hotel, which I declined to stay with friends instead. This resulted in a $37.97 charge from Uber to get into Central Philadelphia. Arriving at my friend’s around 1:30 AM without my baggage (since it was held inside Terminal A and I arrived in Terminal C) – I was exhausted and fell asleep. The next morning, I called TAP Air Portugal to let them know about this misconnect and that’s where things really got fun. I was sent to a call center that basically stated my flights were canceled and I would have to rebook an entirely new fare for $1,000 (after paying nearly $1,000 for the original ticket). I begged if it was possible just to move the outbound flight one day, and I was told no. I asked what options were available to salvage this trip, and I was told nothing – my flight was canceled. I spoke with the manager and still no resolve. I had booked the first night of lodging on May 13, 2023 in Sao Tome at a cost of $150, and the second night of lodging on May 14, 2023 at a cost of $250. These were not refunded. I tried reaching every avenue with the airline and was met with “your flight is canceled and you must rebook a new fare.” Additionally, I had arranged a local guide at a cost of 200 Euro. This guide lost out on an opportunity to make money in a country that does not see tourism. As much as I wanted to make the best of things – I decided I wasn’t about to spend any more money on flights and to just find something in Lisbon – a city I never intended to visit in the first place. I settled on the Moxy Lisbon at an additional cost of $209.15. I went to the hotel and fell asleep – defeated by the whole process in a city I never intended to visit in the first place. The best part – I bid for an upgrade on my flight back from Sao Tome to Lisbon (TAP Air Portugal Flight TP 1532 departing on May 15, 2023) and this was accepted AFTER the customer service representative stated my flight was canceled. I was charged $400 for a flight that the airline canceled and returning from a destination I wasn’t even able to visit. Absolutely shameful.

### "scammed into paying $250 for luggage fees"
We were scammed into paying $250 for luggage fees. We got to the airport 3 hours early, and were not able to get into the gate until 10 minutes before boarding time because it was blocked off by a partition. Once they let the line of people into the gate area, we were told we would have to pay $250 for our carryons because they were heavier than 10kg, even though we paid online to check a bag in advance. But the agent told us we would have to check the bag downstairs, and since the flight was about to leave we didn't have time to check our bags so we had to pay. We also hardly received any water while on the flight. My wife is pregnant and had to ask the flight attendant multiple times on the 12 hour flight just for a glass of water.

### "boarding was very confusing"
Flight full and boarding was very confusing we were told to get in then had to wait for more then 25 minutes in the sleeve that was very cold with no explanation. Once authorized to get in it looked like a race to get us to our seats, but arrived on time.

### "arrived on time"
Flight on time, staff very pleasant boarding was fast, arrived on time at destination.

### "wouldn't hesitate to use them again"
Used TAP from LGW as no direct flight from Heathrow, check in quick as was fast track security the lounge No 1 lounge was okay. Boarding pretty organised so quickly at our seats A1 & A3 business class typically middle seat blocked, departed on time once in the air lunch served which was fine. Crew where good with extra drinks served arrived on time after 2 hours and waited 20 min for bags. Returned in economy check in quick as was security, used the lounge through my FF status boarding quick and the flight departed about 20 minutes late. Crew where fine as where the seats A4 & B4, TAP like many airlines in Europe serve nothing in economy not even water which I don't understand, otherwise the trip was good and having used TAP on 4 flights over the previous 6 months I wouldn't hesitate to use them again. Only let down was the check in experience at Gatwick, the agent didn't speak once she actually looked like she had just fallen out of bed, and sums up London Gatwick itself! A dreadful airport.

### "most scandalous business class"
There were enough counters to check in for business class but boarding was a disaster. The plane was not at a gate and a rather long drive by a bus was necessary. Old 319 with very hard seats. With a business class ticket one could go to the bus first but that was it. The captain gave some information before and also during the flight. The inflight service was extremely poor, one of the most scandalous business classes in Europe. A plate with some cold stuff and 2 slices of a dark stale bread no rolls at all - extremely poor and limited choice of drinks. On a 2.30 hour flight just one drink? FA were very neutral. I was happy the flight was over and Brussels was reached some 10 min ahead. I never will book this airline again. Avoid TAP ! !

### "Rude customer service"
Not Verified | Worst airline ever. I have been in every continent except Antarctic and all 50 states. These people should not be able to call this an airline. Rude customer service, no real service on the plane. Everyone was angry by time we finally left. Showed our passport so many times it became a joke with the passengers. Not only will I never fly this airlines again, I will never return to Portugal. We retired to travel and have a travel vlog. Everyone will hear about this. Make sure you bring your wallet. It was different flying the airlines in Amsterdam than Portugal. They charged extra for bags. I am writing this as I wait on a hot bus waiting to go a plane where we will get to carry our luggage up the stairs. Just horrible. Again, horrible airlines!

### "never encountered such incompetency"
I have never encountered such incompetency. While the agents were polite the system was hell. I  spent over 9 hours on the phone, where my calls were constantly dropped over and over. Frustration is a useless word to describe this experience. I was told by the supervisor that my return flight ticket was canceled, but it was not and I appeared as a No Show, so I had to purchase another ticket to get home. Upon trying to book the ticket at 609 USD online, the system one again keep screwing up and wouldn't take my payment. Upon calling TAP I was given a new rate of $949 despite the fact that their website was faulty. No consideration. Now I'll be forced to contest this over weeks and weeks as they say they will call or email but dont . On board experience is fine, it's the administration, communication and website usage that are a horror story.

### "seats are very old and uncomfortable"
The flight was in the morning and on time. The cabin is acceptably clean, but the seats are very old and uncomfortable. The crew is professional but particularly nice. There is a very limited option of food and drinks, but they do offer you a small cup of water.

### "flight was cancelled 1hr before departure"
The flight was cancelled 1hr before departure. I received a text message when I was already at the airport. The customer service desk is understaffed, and absolutely incompetent and slow. I was rebooked on a next day flight that in no way fitted my needs. I made a request of refund, and 6 months later still haven’t received it.

### "not even a glass of water was served"
Our flight was officially 2 hours and 55 minutes late. Indeed, after 3 hours delay EU regulations would have compelled TP to pay a 200 Euros + fine to each pax. However it was a bit fake, as, of course, boarding was closed at 14:55 (for a flight supposed to leave at 12:00). But the flight itself took off much later. By train or bus we would have arrived home before. Even so, not even a glass of water was served. Fortunately, our mileage program status allowed us to wait three hours in TAP lounge, which is, as already mentioned in a previous review, overpacked and serving unhealthy food.

### "They want your money for everything"
TAP does not allow their passenger to choose their seats, not even at the time of check-in. I was checking my dad in and when it got to choose the seat I was surprised it was only possible if paying. They want your money for everything. To totally rip you off. Disgraceful company, not a surprise they are on the verge of bankruptcy.

### "Avoid this airline if you can"
Not Verified |  Avoid this airline if you can. I had right to use 1 luggage and at the counter they allow me to bring the carry on to airplane cabin. Then before to access the airplane  a TAP representative with a scale weighed carry on and my back pack and both together were over their limit. And even when I showed to representative my ticket allowed to send the carry on to cargo space of airplane, they don’t allow me and make me pay there, other wise I will not access the airplane. But even if this is not the enough I have to take care of the carry on until I boarded the airplane, They charge to you there but the cannot take care of the luggage there.

### "grotesquely rude TAP agent"
At the boarding gate, gate 23 at Lisbon airport, a portable scale (no idea how accurate or when last calibrate) was being used to weight the carRy on and personal bag. A limit of 12kilos was the cutoff. My combined bags were 14.5 kilos. Upon witch I was told by a aggressively grotesquely rude TAP agent, that my bag needs to be checked. Otherwise I could not board with these extra 2.5 kilos. I was told that an immediate payment of 80€ was due now, as per the Terms of Agreement. I did some mental math an concluded that my clothes were not worth demanded amount. So I offered her my bag. Then a more ominous threat was issued about intentionally abandoned bags. I was one of only 2 passengers that I noticed to have paid the 80€. After myself a group of youngish looking German passengers made a serious fuss over the on the spot extortion. Thereafter the money grabbing exercise seemed suspended. Once onboard I complained to the crew about the 80€ for 2.5 kilos, and how absurd the whole experience was. Then was advised to log onto flytap.com/talk-to-us and register a complaint. I tried 12 times, each time I was returned to the book a flight site. I couldn't fill in all the fields of the details portion. To fill in the date I had to tap the field, then scroll 60+times from the available 2017 all the way to the current date. Very frustrating it was. Then when I tried to put my country of residence in, the site claimed Canada didn't exist. The entirety of the "talk to us/complaints" site is designed to frustrate and dismay anyone from complaining.

### "do NOT deal with them"
Not Verified | TAP Portugal gate attendants do not accept the standard United States carry on luggage and also if you pass 10kg for carry on and 2 kg for per item, they literally take 125 euros per person. Do yourself a favor and do NOT deal with them! You save few bucks here but they get you AT THE GATE with no chances for you to say no. Also they do not accept American Express. They want the American market with their conditions. Be smart!

### "Stay away from TAP!"
It's been 8 months since my terrible experience with TAP. Warning! Do not fly with this airline. Got to airport and found that flight had to stop midway and that it couldn't get to us. Had to spend the night. TAP would not get us a hotel room. Said they would reimburse us. I've been trying for 8 months and I still get the same email reply from them. Of course our flight the next day was delayed hours causing us to miss our connection in Lisbon. Zero luck getting reimbursed on that as well. Don't expect any reimbursements from these people. It's amazing they're still flying. I've seen my comments repeated often times in these reviews of TAP. I'm sorry, but that isn't business class. All I can say is read all the comments. Stay away from TAP!

### "Poor customer service"
Strange airline. Poor customer service. My seat was 3C. The storage above my seat was empty, and as expected, I put my bag in there. Flight attendant came up, pulled out my bag and snapped at me that I would have to find a storage space down the plane as she was keeping my storage space (above row 3) for business passengers. Yup, wont fly with these folks again.

### "received such a strong attitude"
Not Verified |  I paid for my seats on a TAP round trip but my husband was departing later and returning with me so I had to book his seat right after mine. Their server at that point wasn’t working but I figured no problem I will do it by phone. They then informed me since I bought the ticket through Expedia originally they could not do a phone seat purchase without charging me $200 extra for the return flight! They would have to re-issue it. Furthermore, they were extremely rude about it, particularly the manager, who basically said too bad, complain to Expedia, that’s how it is even though the issue was their server and I had no trouble buying my seats for $61.00. I will work hard to avoid ever needing to use this airline again and will ensure my many friends hear about it. I can’t believe there was neither any support, nor solution, and in fact though I was staying calm but strong about what I needed, I received such a strong attitude from the manager.

### "avoid this airline at all costs"
Horrible experience. I paid extra for our carry-on bags, only to be told at the gate I had to pay extra extra unless I checked the bags downstairs. Well, Lisbon does not announce gates until 60 minutes before departure, which means there is no time to go back through security. So, my bag is going to be placed in the hold, when I pre-paid for hold luggage, and I am being charged an extra 80 bucks for this. It is a criminal practice. I will tell everyone I know in person and on-line to avoid this airline at all costs. Do not ever visit Portugal if you have to fly TAP.

### "Very unpleasant experience"
Worst airline ever! If you wish your holiday totally ruined, use this Airline. If I had read all these reviews about TAP, I would have never booked the flight with them. They indeed try ripping you off by turning your carry on luggage to checked in baggage just before boarding the aircraft. Our carry on luggage and personal items were well within their stated limit and size and without any reasonable explanation, they tagged the carry on luggage just before boarding the aircraft. The TAP staff at the boarding gate told me it was due to the plane being full and the carry on luggage being oversized, however it was a transit flight and when boarded previously in London, there was no issue at all. In addition, when boarding the plane, nobody bothered to check the tagged baggage and when boarded the plane, the plane was one-third empty and the overhead compartment was half empty. At the gate, they were also checking for the COVID-19 vaccination record which was never pre-notified at any stages of the travel. The staff at the gate were all very rude, ill mannered and patronizing. I was disgusted and appalled by their staff training if at all any existed. Very unpleasant experience with TAP which I will never ever repeat.

### "Beware of deceptive luggage practices"
Not Verified |  Beware of deceptive luggage practices. This airline has deceptive practices regarding "last minute" requirements forcing us to check carryon luggage as check luggage and then imposing exorbitant fees for the checked luggage. On the flight with the same carrier (same aircraft) from Newark to Lisbon there I was able to board with the approved carryon items.

### "a dreadful airline"
AWFUL AIRLINE; Do not use them. Kept us in a plane on the tarmac for 1.5 hours. Then took us of as they hadn't prepared the plane adequately. All they could do was put us on a plane 5.5 hours later which went to Heathrow and not Gatwick. We were informed we would be reimbursed the additional travel costs incurred. Have used their complaints service to try and get money back as there is no other means to do so. My emails have been ignored. Spent 45 minutes trying to get through their customer service on the phone; they simply suggested I email them another complaint. They are a dreadful airline. Will never use them again.

### "TAP refused to pay the full refund"
TAP airlines cancelled my flight from Lisbon to San Francisco for Feb 6th, 2023. We were re-booked by TAP on the flight leaving Lisbon on Feb 4th. We couldn't even be in Lisbon on Feb 4th. On the TAP website there is info "If your flight has been canceled by TAP, you may request full refund of the amount you have paid:" I requested a full refund for the cancelled flight. Out of $300+ I paid for the ticket, I received a refund of $47.73. I filed a complaint with TAP and TAP refused to pay the full refund.

### "I will never fly TAP again"
My journey and trouble began at the departure airport when I was given a boarding pass for New York instead of Lisbon. Once I caught it my luggage had already been sent to the wrong aircraft. They had to manually get it and change it My luggage was damaged on a flight. I began the process of filling the paperwork and pictures when I returned to Canada Two weeks later. I didn’t receive a response for 7 months when they asked me for the same info I’d already sent. I resent the info and pictures. I received the same email requesting the info a month later and resent. Following 9 months of sending the info three times they then began sending emails saying I’d requested the damage compensation too late and due to the “Montreal convention” It has to be within 7 days of the incident. I requested I hear from the manager and what was this policy only the receive the same email twice more. This airline should be ashamed of their customer service. I will never fly TAP again.

### "$125 per bag each way for bags"
Not Verified |  Booked TAP because it was the cheapest fare. However, they make us pay $125 per bag each way for bags that have been carry on on about 10 different airlines. Would’ve been cheaper to use a better airlines. On return flight, they made every single person check their bag.

### "no messages or refunds from TAP "
My flight from Amsterdam to Lisbon was cancelled three hours before departure, when I was already at the airport. Even though TAP had my e-mail address and telephone number, there was no further communication at all. It was only when I logged in with my booking reference that I saw that I had been rebooked to leave very early the following morning, with a layover in Munich. That would take me nine hours. No hotel voucher was offered and I decided to cancel my trip. The TAP website was totally unhelpful for this, and I had to wait for 30 minutes in the queue for a telephonic help desk. It was only then that I managed to cancel, and request a refund. We are now three weeks on, and there have been no messages or refunds from TAP so far. No contact data are provided to make enquiries about the refund. I consider my money lost.

### "Worst business class experience"
Not Verified |  
We spent a small fortune to upgrade to business class only to find the seats were the same as economy. Basically the same as people paying half the price. Worst business class experience I’ve seen.

### "going down at a surprising speed"
TAP is going down at a surprising speed. In MRS they canceled their lounge agreement. No premium boarding for business class either; food on board was not cold; It was a freezing quiche and a frozen salmon. Lounge in LIS is maybe the worst (or best) example: food was not eatable, just horrible. Coca-cola but no mineral water, etc, etc..... Premium boarding was not premium as many "friends" could board in priority (they look very intimate). My seat on brand new A330NEO was broken. Fortunately their were empty setas, and we may understand why. IFS was full of old movies. NO games. Food was OK though. During all flights crew was very nice, and tried to provide all efforts to compensate the running down of their airline. A shame. How long will they believe that people will pay the same price for business class tickets (or even more) than before COVID, for a LCC ?

### "Cheap and awful airline"
Not Verified |  Booked a connection flight to fly with this airline for first time. Barcelona to Lisbon delayed 45 mins but was assured by both ground staff and aeroplane not to worry the connection flight must wait for me. Arrived in Lisbon, connection flight gone. Staff remarkably said that they do not hold flights for 10 or 20 people would need to be a 100 people minimum, which was some insult to me and the other people left stranded only to be taken to a hotel the other side of Lisbon. I'm back now to fly home 3 days later and my flight is again delayed. The reason given is simply Operations, awaiting further information. Cheap and awful airline with zero value for its customers

### "I will fly with them again"
The crew was very nice and attentive, food was good and enough. The wine selection was also good and the Port was excellent. The seat was comfortable and the on board entertainment good. There was no wifi. But for a price tag of a little over 2000 Euros this was a nice flight. I will fly with them again.

### "very reliable carrier"
Very nice flight. Left on time despite a very very full flight. Very nice crew. Kudos to the pilot very nice and funny above all a very reliable carrier - hope they can keep the good work.

### "we will never fly on TAP Portugal again"
TAP Portugal informed us right before our first flight that our connecting flight has been cancelled. We were moved to a flight to Washington DC the following day with an extra connection. When we arrived in Lisbon I discovered that the Chicago flight was not actually cancelled. The first flight was just delayed and they assumed we would not make the connect. The Chicago flight was there but we were already re-booked for the following day. We were handed new boarding passes and were told to go to the help desk to obtain hotel vouchers. We stood in line for 3.5 hours while one person worked the desk. When it was finally our turn to speak to the TAP representative, we were informed that they were out of hotel vouchers. We needed to book our own hotel and request a reimbursement for the hotel and transportation. Had we known that, we would have done that 3.5 hours earlier. We arrived in Chicago 22 hours after we were originally scheduled. It took TAP nearly 3 months to partially reimburse us. TAP reimbursed us for the hotel. I followed up about the Uber cost, Lisbon hotel tax, and purchased seats cost on the Chicago flight and the representative would completely ignore my requests. After TAP closed the complaint, I submitted a second one since we were still owed over $200. TAP closed that complaint as well with no response. We fell in love with Portugal when we visited in 2019. As dual US & EU citizens we are planning on retiring in Portugal. But we will never fly on TAP Portugal again! Avoid it like the plague! If I could rate TAP Portugal a zero, I would!

### "They cancelled our return flight"
Not Verified |  They cancelled our return flight and couldn’t offer a new flight until 2 days later due to strikes, which was not acceptable because I had a flight the next day. Turns out the strike was limited to their company only and had nothing to do with the airport, as we booked a flight with another company the same day our flight was supposed to leave from the same airport

### "Do not book with TAP Portugal"
Not Verified |  Dealing with TAP Portugal has been the most aggravating and frustrating experience I've ever had. My partner and I booked tickets on March 20th, 2022 with TAP to go to Morocco in April 2022. Unfortunately we both got COVID-19 and Morocco didn't accept travellers into the country without proof of a negative test. We contacted the airline and we were told that we would have a credit for our tickets that could be used for any flight if we booked within the next year. Okay great, we accepted that and decided we would travel to Europe the following year. Come February 2023. Now the nightmare begins. We call the airline to redeem our credit to fly to Paris in May 2023. My partner calls to book our tickets and we are told we are not allowed to book the discount economy fare on the website, we can only book the basic economy fare which is more expensive. This was annoying since we weren't told there were any limits to the fare type we could choose for our credit. He asked to speak to a supervisor or manager, and was hung up on. My partner calls back again and asks again to talk to a supervisor or manager and is hung up on again. I decided to take matters into my own hands and call the airline myself. I was able to get a supervisor on the phone, who rudely told me that we could only use our credit to travel back to Morocco, which is not what we were told originally. I called back again and got someone relatively friendly and helpful on the phone. This gentleman told me that we are only allowed to book a flight that departs before March 20th (which was the day we booked last year, I was under the impression that we just had to book before this date). We told him we cannot fly in March and he gives us the option to book something in March and then pay the change fee to switch to tickets in May. This option was double the price of what a normal one way ticket should be ($3000 CAD for 2 one-way tickets to Paris with a stop-over, when Air Canada offers non-stop one-way flights to Paris for $1300 CAD). This was obviously a rip off and attempt to price gauge us, so we decided to think about it and considered just cancelling the ticket all together because we were told we would get some kind of refund for the airport fees (he couldn't tell us how much, but gave us a range from approximately $70-$500). So we said we would think about it and call back. I call back because I've found cheaper flights than what the previous representative found for me, and I wanted to book those flights. I'm told that a supervisor will have to contact me in 1-2 days because the representative couldn't find the flight fares I found. I kindly asked him to stress the importance of calling me back because it's been a frustrating experience and we just want to have it resolved. Three days later, no call back. I call the airline again I'm told a different story. This time I am told we only have half the value to use and it must be to Morocco. I'm absolutely livid at this point and ask to speak to the supervisor. The representative tells me the supervisor will tell me the same thing but I said I want to speak with them. I get transferred 4 times. I think I'm just going to cancel and lose the money we spent. Horrible experience. TAP price gauges customers and makes up new information every time you call. Do not book with TAP Portugal.

### "Very nice crew"
Boarding on time all ready and a big fog kept us from taking off so we were late in arrival about 25 minutes. Very nice crew and new plane.

### "disgraceful excuse for an airline"
What a disgraceful excuse for an airline, I only chose them because they were cheaper - big mistake, the additional fees and all the rubbish is where they trick. I checked in in Paris no issue with hand luggage, then in Lisbon, they were weighing bags for hand luggage and if over 10 kilos total were forcing everyone to check in bags and pay a fine of 120 EURO. Food was inedible.

### "Avoid if you can"
Truly terrible. Avoid if you can. Whenever I have been unfortunate enough to fly with this company, my flight has been delayed or canceled. Never once have things gone smoothly. Once, when I was stuck in a city because I missed my connecting flight, they set me up in a hotel that was full. And here I am again at the airport knowing I’m that I will miss my connecting flight due to a delay. The customer service has been disorganized and rude throughout every experience. Can’t wait until they go bankrupt.

### "Goodbye Tap Portugal!"
I have purchased round trip for almost 4000$ not mentioning additional charge 30$ for WiFi! Not mentioning that business class is looking more like premium economy, the stewardesses do not want to do their job. They make you sit till food service is almost ending. Food is horrible, they running out of every selection. Serving cheap wine and only 2 glasses, seats are not comfortable. I will not use this airlines again! Max price it should cost is 1700$ at most! Staff need to get a better training how to treat business class passengers! Goodbye Tap Portugal!

### "Will avoid using TAP in future"
Not Verified | Chaotic check-in at Gatwick as plane had been changed and everybody's reserved seats had to be changed. We had paid extra for up front extra leg room seats but didn't get them. Still allocating seats at departure gate so plane was late into Lisbon. Great flight from Lisbon to Sao Tome, flight less than half full. Was bussed to aircraft and then waited nearly half an hour on a hot enclosed bus to board. I have arthritis and was in a lot of pain having to stand for that long. Food was inedible. Flight back was awful. Took 3 hours to book in in a very hot booking hall and flight left nearly 2 hours late. Flight was full and arrived at a remote stand in Lisbon. Once again on a packed bus. Just managed the connection to London and amazed that our luggage arrived with us. Will avoid using TAP in future.

### "A nice upgrade"
A nice upgrade with the help of the app so flown again business class and it was the same team of flight attendants. What a surprise we got as we were last seats in business class me and my wife were presented with a treat from all the crew that got my wife emotional.

### "Fantastic flight"
Fantastic flight, arrived in Chicago sooner but left 12 minutes late being 17:00 the departure time it was fantastic. Got an upgrade through an app in the boarding gate so flew business class with my wife and let me say it is a great cabin. Flew many companies but TAP rules and above all the kindness was amazing. Felt so special.

### "Dreadful, never again!"
Dreadful, never again! Lost bags both ways. Lost for 4 days on outbound, no help, no reply to emails, messages, utter useless. Still trying to claim for essentials but no one ever replies. Check in utter chaos both ways, massive queues and no one gives a damn. Loads of people in hotel also Lost bags, it seems common on TAP. On board crew friendly, food ok outbound but dreadful on return. Plane was ok. In the air they were ok but the ground side is beyond useless especially in regard to Baggage.

### "asked if I could have a travel voucher"
One month before flying I ruptured my Achilles tendon and I cannot fly. I informed TAP of this and when they replied (eventually) they told me I had two options: 1) Rebook via the rebooking system, which is not fully working as prices are not the same as they are for new bookings or 2) Cancel my flight and get just the taxes back. I asked if I could have a travel voucher that I could use once I have recovered, even if it's a voucher I have to use within a month to travel within six months. They said no. Meanwhile, the company covering my internal Brazil flights issued a full refund, and the company covering my internal Spain flights issued a full voucher to be used within one year. If there is an alternative to flying with TAP, use it.

### "a total lack of transparency"
Will not fly with Tap Portugal again! The problem was with hidden or added costs and a total lack of transparency. When checking in we were not given the option to choose our seats at all - there were seats already assigned to us, and of course those were most uncomfortable, and the option to upgrade them for 55$ was there, with the almost whole plane empty and available as it seemed. Which was ridiculous. I have never happened upon the situation when one has preassigned seats and no option to choose from what is available. A nice way to add a cost of 50$ for a completely regular seat. Then came the baggage. Apparently we had to pay another 105$ to check in one single not-overweight in any way bag. Never ever happened to me before! Every airline includes one bag in its ticket price, every single one i flew with ever! (and those were regular tickets, not discounted or last minute deals, or any deals at all - just regular tickets purchased 3 months ahead at a full price) So in the end a flight, a round trip from Tel Aviv to Cancun cost not 940$ each ticket as paid while ordering the flight, but with 55$ to choose a seat each way, and 105$ for a baggage each way it came to 1240$! 1240$ instead 940$ - let it sink in... If I knew this was the actual cost , I of course would not have ordered the tickets through this particular airline at all. And of course I will not order any tickets through them again.

### "upgrade for an attractive price"
Business class via an upgrade for an attractive price. Seat comfort is good and cabin crew are attentive and friendly. Priority boarding was smooth. The food and drink options were adequate for the 2 hour flight. However, Tap lounge in Lisbon is very below average of what you expect to be the airlines flagship lounge. Also, a welcome drink before takeoff or before the food is served would be a great touch.

### "I wouldn’t recommend TAP Portugal"
We missed our flight from Lisbon to Amsterdam because of the long waiting time at the security control line In the TAP office the lady was incompetent and said that wasn’t their problem to be late because of the control and I should make another booking and pay for it. The next one was at next day. She didn’t offer us a hotel or another ticket. I must book a flight to Brussel with fast track and payed around 800 euros for that! I took a taxi then from Brussel to Amsterdam , so i can join an important appointment at next day. The whole situation was so awful and I wouldn’t recommend TAP Portugal.

### "the worst I've ever flown with"
Not Verified |  TAP Portugal is the worst I've ever flown with. At first they cancelled my flight. The next flight was delayed and I missed my connection. No apology or explanation. Just bad.

### "TAP for me is always fantastic"
Like always full flight, flight on time, very speedy boarding and nice stewards. Want to say flying TAP for me is always fantastic, the only thing was the baggage for dispatch that they wanted me to pay but all sorted out in TAP's good way.

### "should have paid me the compensation automatically"
Not Verified |  I fly on regular base with TAP. In general I am satisfied with the service. However this time my flight was cancelled at the very last moment and could fly 2 days later. According EU rules tap must compensate me with 600 euro for each ticket. After 6 month I did not hear anything from tap. My request has still the status Under investigation. Such a simple issue, TAP should have paid me the compensation automatically. It is a shame that I do not get an answer after 6 month.

### "experiences weren't bad at all"
Booked my flight during the pandemic and rescheduled twice. Endless calls with TAP's contact centre. Contact members giving contradicting advice on flight options. Some employees would be very calm and patient, others would simply cut the line. This part was horrible. I spend hours calling them. We took our flights with a 6-month baby and used the bassinet. We had our doubts beforehand, but were positively surprised. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Aircraft clean and well maintained. Layover in Lisbon straightforward. Lisbon-Amsterdam was a full flight, so space was limited unfortunately. Wanted to share this experience, because TAP has such a bad rating. I have flown TAP before to Brazil and must confess that both my experiences weren't bad at all. Contact centre must be improved though.

### "Good value for service"
On time,  great plane almost new and the crew was fantastic. Good value for service. The only glitch that they keep making is the departure on remote stand and passengers being locked for 10 minutes on the bus

### "Worst of the worst"
Not Verified | I traveled to Portugal and while here I had to have emergency surgery, I was not allowed to fly for a week, surgery was 2 days before going back home to the USA. I tried calling got no answer after several attempts on the 18th and 19th of January finally got someone that told me to send the medical notice which I did that same day of the 19th. No one called back or responded, needed to do the flight change which was in my email. On the 26th still no response was able to get in touch with someone in management department who promised they would have someone call me. On the 27th, someone finally called, gave me a new date for February 14th but instead of doing a flight change due to medical reasons, they booked me as a new flight and listed me as a no show for other flight. I had paid $300.00 for 2 suitcases with now they won’t allow me to take back and want me to pay another $335.00 to take my clothes back home. They try to tell me that was for one way only! Really? Why would I leave all my things in Portugal. So at this point there is no one to help you, I have filed 2 complaints online, 1 written complaint at the airport, cause the call center is out of the country and no one, literally no one is available to help you in Portugal. And refuse to. They try to say even though I have a certified letter from the doctor. That unless I had cancer or Covid they could not consider it a medical emergency, even though I could haemorrhage during the flight due to the high altitude and pressure. They charged me a total of $700.00 more for me to be able to get home with my things. Portugal is beautiful don’t hesitate to come, but please stay away from TAP air Portugal. Service is horrible on top of that. They will rip you off, I could have taken 1st class for the money I’ve had to pay them. I rate them a minus 10. Worst of the worst

### "the flight attendants were very arrogant"
Like always flight on time and arrived early but this time they changed my assigned seat, no justification and put me in the aisle which was not nice. First complaint on more then 20 flights last two years and also the flight attendants were very arrogant, that was a first.

### "still a very solid and reliable product"
Overall, good experience and I would do it again. Pros: Brand new plane with top notch entertainment system including selection of 150 movies. The captain was very attentive to the passengers and communicating regularly, particularly during a long period of moderate turbulence which was scary. He also explained why they left with a small delay related to the late arrival of the previous flight from Tel Aviv. The online booking and check-in system was flawless and very intuitive. Cons: Boarding from a remote stand in Lisbon, but that's not the airline's fault. In-flight staff was efficient but not particularly friendly like in Asian airlines. Food was not great but still edible. The lunch was served immediately after take off and then a light meal was served just before landing. Considering the flight was almost 8 hours, there were more than 6 hours between meals and no drinks or food were served during that period. TAP long haul is not a slam dunk but still a very solid and reliable product to take you from Europe to North America. My favourite feature was the inflight entertainment system. I regretted not getting the Economy Xtra seat, for almost 8 hours it is probably worth it as the standard seat is very cramped and for anyone over 1,80 m it will not be that comfortable.

### "there is no customer care"
They lost our stroller on a delayed connection flight, which can happen but they just don't care. They close reclamations without resolution, there is no customer care at all and you need to legally fight them for anything.

### "horrible planes, horrible staff"
Not Verified | This airline is a shambles, there is not one positive I can think of with the three flights I took with them. At check-in told the flight was overbooked and we could not be issued proper boarding passes, we are a family of 5 so had little hope of all getting seats. Staff didn't care at all and just shrugged their shoulders making out it was our fault for not checking in online. On the flights we did eventually get on they were cramped and uncomfortable. Cabin crew rude and inept in dealing with masses of hand baggage and no locker space. Their solution was to walk away and leave passengers puzzled; the result was we took off late and in dangerous conditions with people sitting sideways, legs in the aisle as wheelie cases were rammed under seats in front. On the return we had a connection in Lisbon - big mistake. First flight was an hour late so we had 20 minutes to catch the next plane. TAP did nothing to help, no assistance, no one there to direct us on arrival and not even an advance notice of what gate to go to. We did catch the next flight but only because that was delayed too. If you are thinking of booking this airline - don't! If you have an option to fly someone else, even if slightly more expensive take it. The journey will be a nightmare from start to finish with TAP, horrible planes, horrible staff and no concern for passengers or their safety.

### "decreasing the quality"
The Portuguese carrier staff since years has worsened its onboard services.While other airlines are improving their services TAP is decreasing the quality. Flight TP016 from REC to LIS (2 hours of delay) on 13.01.2023 in business class. No one aspect of the whole service can be claimed as business service. The REC-LIS route is the only direct service from Recife to Europe. TAP is a monopolistic carrier. If you want to fly to REC with other airlines you need to go through GIG or GRU. The flight then becomes very long. When you fly to REC with TAP they do not care at all. No competition no service improvement. - No welcome drink once a board - Very poor menu. The breakfast is even worst than the dinner. A tiny small of fruit salad and a small plate with two slices of cheese and one of Brie type of cheese.Half slice of very low quality ham (not edible at all) and one slice of salami. I asked for a coffee with milk and they tried to give me powder milk. After a complaint the “normal” milk appeared and was served directly from the box. Bread selection out of any comment - Unfriendly and rude staff. The staff is always in a rush when they have to serve the meals. After the fast services they start chitchatting behind the curtains. They don’t smile at all. It looks they are going to a funeral. The toilets have No difference with the Economy one. No hand cream, nor refreshing towel or other little amenities. - The internet connection was not available - The only positive thing that cannot offset the whole bad service is the lie-flat bed. That’s all!

### "plane left on time"
A new plane, with in flight entertainment plane left on time and arrived 12 minutes earlier, the crew with a smile. The only complaint was the boarding in a remote stand in Lisbon and we had to stay in the bus before boarding closed for more then 5 minutes.

### "canceled with no email or phone call"
Flight on 09/01/23 was canceled with no email or phone call to me letting me know about this. Got to airport 3 hours before flight for check in and was told my flight is canceled. They put me on a next day flight, 17 hours after the original flight asked about hotel or food. I was told to go and choose whatever keep receipts pay from my pocket and then submit a complaint online to be reimbursed. How ridiculous this can be ?

### "last time ever flying with TAP "
I have been unable to reach the airline over the phone and their voicemail is full. I'm getting, at best, 1 email back per day. During the email back and forth, I mentioned that it seemed like my bag was being routed back to Casablanca, which is my vacation destination. The agent proceeded to tell me that they had my Grenadian address on file, and even confirmed it. This morning, I received an email from a gentleman in Casablanca CMN informing me that my bag is ready for pick-up. Again, I'm 4000 miles across the Atlantic and it is physically impossible for me to do so. So far, not a single person in this airline has even offered an apology and everyone is acting like this is the most common situation. It goes without saying that this was my last time ever flying with TAP and I will spare no amount of money in the future to avoid your company.

### "will fly them again if the price is right"
Not Verified |  Went to Israel via Lisbon on TAP Portugal. Check in ok. Lounge at O'Hare terminal 5 SAS lounge which is inadequate. Boarding on time, delayed departure due to rain. Received the gluten free meal I ordered and fell asleep on a flat bed. Had a good night sleep skipped breakfast, my son told me it was nothing to write home about. Arrival in Lisbon via a bus gate, no need to clear security. No lounge in the Schengen zone. Staff courteous. LIS-TLV, again a bus to the plane, not full plane, not even close. A321LR, 1-1, and 2-2 staggered. Very comfortable seats. No gluten free meal, but they offered me the guinea fowl which was tasty. I felt ok. There was cheese and desert which I could not eat. The purser really apologized, and he genuinely felt bad about it. Cabin not present, but if you asked for something it was promptly delivered to your seat. The port served was wonderful. Overall will fly them again if the price is right. Consider a stop over in Portugal. Have a lounge in the Schengen zone. Had to use the Wifi from Lisbon to TLV, very expansive, but worked well.

### "should kick out TAP from the alliance"
Not Verified |  It's a 12.5 h flight and TAP only provides two meals. There is no snack available even for purchase. They provide lunch right after the take-off (around noon-ish Lisbon time), after that there is no food for 9 hours. The food option is also mostly carb in economy class. The real problem was after landing in SFO. It took a while to get to the get after landing, not TAP's fault. After immigration, people gathered around baggage claim. After 10 minutes bags started to show up - wait, only 10 bags came and they all belonged to the crew! We waited another 15 minutes, no sign of any other bags. We asked the TAP stewards and stewardess who were also waiting but nothing came out. Another 20 minutes passed, we asked CBP, United Customer service, called TAP phone number, no solution - no one knows! The Stewards went to their hotels and we were thinking of doing the same but there was no guarantee that TAP would deliver them to your home! Finally the bags came after 1h 15 min! No TAP reps were visible during this entire time. They never picked up their phone. United rep announced on PA system several time to TAP reps come and talk to the passengers without any result. Overall, a horrible experience. Star Alliance should kick out TAP from the alliance.

### "All in all ok for the money"
Short flight from Lisbon to Faro. Flight on time aircraft clean. Seat space very low. Hand luggage was checked at Lisbon airport. Mine did not fit. But did not charge anyone extra for loading luggage in the plane. So this was fine. Also I was able to change seats at the gate for free to get a better one. All in all ok for the money. No service on short flights.

### "service on board was good"
Used TAP Air Portugal for a return trip between London & Lisbon over the New Year, check in at Heathrow Terminal 2 was quick as was fast track security. TAP use the Lufthansa lounge which was pretty good for a few hours before boarding, boarding was pretty quick seat 2A & C in a typical European business class set up where fine for myself and partner. Departed about 1 hour late with the flight taking around 2 hrs 40 min the flight arrived about an hour late too, service on board was good with alright food and nice crew. Returning Lisbon to Heathrow on 1st Jan, check in and security was quick taking 20 min to complete everything, although the airport isn't the best. The TAP lounge was actually okay and a nice place to sit waiting for the departure, boarding as with arrival was via a 15 min bus ride across the airport. Once onboard seat 1 F & 1 D where fine although once seated where advised of a delay eventually departing 90 min late, service on board was good nice crew and food was pretty nice. Arrived at LHR 1 hour late after a 2 hour flight, bags where off quickly, nice service only point maybe if the delays and the bus tour which appears the norm at Lisbon airport.

### "They lost all my luggage"
Worst company I use. Bad customer service. They lost all my luggage on New Year's Eve, no one has a clue where they are and I've been stuck in a hotel room for 3 days without anything basic. There is no one to talk to, customer service working hours like on vacation Without a doubt this is the last time I fly with this company, I can't believe it is a Star Alliance company

### "Worst customer service"
Worst customer service for an airline! Poor system communication -- we received an email 4 hours prior to departure stating the flight was canceled, Google showed the flight was canceled but the phone support staff insisted the flight was not canceled and instructed us to go to the airport. This was a managerial staff we were speaking / got directed to. We went to the airport to learn that the flight was indeed cancelled. They were not able to book us on the next flight out or the next morning, nor were we able to get a refund. TAP could have better communication/ system reflecting the most recent changes (ie. cancelled flight) which would save us time. It was a more senior phone support manager we were speaking to who insisted the flight was not cancelled and we should still head to the airport. Awful communication. TAP could have offered us a few options - refund, alternative route, alternative timing - and none was offered! TAP refused to give us a refund despite it being a European Union law that if a flight was canceled, a refund has to be made to the customer. I had to rebook a brand new ticket and called the hotline to confirm there is space in cabin hold for my small pet dog. They confirmed it and I went ahead to book the ticket (which costs 4x the price of the former initial return ticket). Then when processing payment for the pet on hold, they informed me that since it's with Portugalia, they are no longer able to take my pet! Another example of utterly poor communication and inexperienced + untrained staff.

### "For the price it was okay"
Flight was delayed about two hours. Aircraft was modern but seat space is lower than Ryanair, really cramped. Crew was professional. Water in cups was served for free if you asked. Hot Ham and cheese sandwich was 4,50 € even cheaper as pointed on menu. Tap allows 10 KG as a carry on and only 2KG personal item as a small backpack. This is really rare. Sometimes they might check. However not on my flight. For the price it was okay.

### "I recommend avoiding them"
If you are looking for trouble, you are well positioned with TAP. Whenever I fly with them, I have issues and with no exceptions. Last June I was supposed to fly from GRU to ZRH. The GRU to LIS flight was cancelled and I learned about it at check-in only. Nobody wanted to take care and book me on a same day flight to ZRH with another company. Now I have just been informed that there is a schedule change from Faro to Zurich on May 1, 2023 and they rebooked me on a flight where I would have a 7 hours layover in LIS. Lastminute.com where I had booked the flight could not care less neither. Together, a very toxic combination. I could go on with other issues with TAP - being put in the last seat row next to the toilet as a Star Gold Member. Cabin crews that are incompetent and could not care less… TAP for me is just absolutely disgraceful. I recommend avoiding them whenever you can.

### "great service and experience"
Boarding on time, leaving on time arriving early, a fantastic experience. Thanks again for the great service and experience.

### "expensive low budget company"
How is this company part of the Star Alliance? An expensive low budget company. Delayed flights, no food/snacks served, no variety of beverages (that you had to pay for). Weighing your carry-on and charging you extra, keeping your carry-ons down because they have no space in the cabin.

### "Next time, I’ll be paying just a bit more for an organized airline"
Amsterdam to Lisbon was okay since there was only one gate assigned to the flight. However, Lisbon to Copenhagen had at least another 5 flights attached to the same gate so I thought everyone was waiting for the same flight and the airline was running late. So I finally went up to see what’s going on and they tell the flight has been closed. I was shocked seeing as there were so many people there for gate 20. To top it off, we could never even hear the agents because the airport had someone on speaker going on and on about different flights. So, if the agent was relaying information about our flight, we would have never known. They told me unsympathetically to go to the customer service where the lady scoffed at me and was like tough luck. Never flying with TAP and would not recommend anyone either. Next time, I’ll be paying just a bit more for an organized airline. No refund by the way.

### "forcing me to check my actual carry-on"
This airline is 0/10. A backpack that is considered a personal item on every airline is not considered one with TAP. They made me take it on as a carry-on forcing me to check my actual carry-on that was below the 10 kg limit. The personal item must be 2 kg or below—that isn’t even a normal purse. This was a completely crazy experience and I needed to pay €70. Fly RyanAir it’s more straightforward.

### "worst business class product in Europe"
TAP Portugal has in my experience, the worst business class product in Europe. The experience starts at the airport, particularly in Lisbon but also in Salvador, where the boarding experience is messy as can be. What’s the point in having an “executive” line if you first make a plane-load of passengers gather in tiny areas right before boarding? Once you make it to the aircraft you are greeted with the minimum amount of pleasantries and shown to your seat. Now it has to be said that TAP has clearly chosen to buy their business class seats with the lowest possible bidder, in the A330-200 this is Thomson Aero seating, and in the A330-900 it’s Recaro - both of which have a reputation for delivering on time and on quality but a very basic product that is very poorly customised and appointed. Examples include not having a stowage in every seat in B/C, having enormous gaps between suites on the centrelines, having a meal table that deploys from the centreline which impedes egress from the seat when the table is in use, and I could go on. Long story short, expect comfort, but don’t expect much else. The amenity kit provided is very poor and is not worthy of much more wordage than that - absolute bare minimum. Once you have sat down you are left without service until cruise - no welcome drinks - no post take off appetiser service - absolutely nothing until the meal service starts. That’s right - €5000 return ticket - and the only time you’ll get a glass or sparkling white (no champagne onboard obviously) is when the meal service starts. Now - onto the meal. I would put the quality of what is served somewhere at the Air France international economy mark - with the exception of presentation which obviously is a little better. BUT - the food is so incredibly basic. There is no flair or culture or any sign of Portuguese-ness in what is being served. For a country with such a culinary culture, to be given a pasta, chicken and fish “option” is a real pity: it’s just so tactless and basic. Anyway, when I try to find redeeming features I really come out blank. There is nothing good that I can think of about this airline, they really have specialised in the most generic, lowest bidding, poor customer service arena of any flag carrier that I’ve flown in the last few years. The only thing I can say is that they probably afford to do this because there is very little in the way of point-to-point flights from Europe to Brazilian destinations so if you want to avoid GIG or GRU, you kinda have to fly TAP via LIS to get anywhere in that country.

### "TAP is nothing short of a disgrace"
TAP Portugal standards have dropped terribly in the past few years. This was a 3.25 hour flight at supper time and the business class meal was appalling. Snack size portions of cold food and stale bread roll. Flight was delayed leaving Munich by over an hour and the flight crew said nothing, and not one apology was offered at any time. Portuguese efficiency was then backed up by this delayed flight using a very distant bussing gate on arrival into Lisbon that added another 30 mins to the delay. I find the Portuguese people to be hospitable, but their cabin crew are the exact opposite. The snack tray is passed out very quickly and retrieved 15 mins later, and they then disappeared into the front galley for the duration of the flight. They have no seat power supply, no cabin wifi and no cabin service. I know that Star Alliance airlines can be inconsistent, but TAP is nothing short of a disgrace.

### "not a very full flight"
I must be a case study, arrived early, good condition plane, old but well maintained, not a very full flight, landed 16 minutes before was due. Very pleasant crew, looking out to serve you correct,.

### "airline that always has delays"
I have been on a few TAP flights and they are always delayed by at least 1 hour, they never tell people that the flight is delayed, they just let everyone wait by the gate wasting everyone's time. I've never flown with an airline that always has delays.

### "very rough and unprofessional"
The TAP agents checking in are very rough and unprofessional. I was mistreated with getting checked in and had me move items from my personal bag to my carry on and made me weight my jacket, and at the end made me pay $140 because I did not move 3 pounds from my personal bag to my my carry on. Makes no sense since we are bring the same weight to the plane. I do not care about the money, their roughness and lack of customer service has me scratching my head. I fly a lot across many airlines in US and international and never got this sort of treatment. I do not recommend TAP to anyone

### "Food was subpar at best"
I can’t begin to describe how much of a nightmare this airline is. First of all they will force you to check your baggage even if it’s just a carry on for smaller flights and even then there wasn’t enough room in the overhead compartments. Clearly states online that the weight limit is 10kg and they don’t give you any issues whatsoever on any connecting flights until you’re on your flight back home literally 30 seconds before you board the plane and tell you if you don’t pay the overweight fee they will not let you board the plane. Lady literally got confrontational with me and in my face when I tried to show her on their website where it says the weight limit and was yelling at me and then told ME to calm down. Multiple people were annoyed because they did the same thing to them. There was no organization whatsoever. We sat next to a bathroom that one stewardess said was broken, one said was occupied and then eventually one realized was just simply locked. We had to deal with telling just about everyone on the plane over half the flight that the bathroom wasn’t working only for them to continuously step on our feet trying to get to the other side of the plane to use the other bathroom. Food was subpar at best and they few drinks they did give you were literally 4 oz each. Movie selection was limited. DO NOT GET ME STARTED on the seats. Each time I had people in my seat and leg room because it was so crowded. If I didn’t have my partner sitting next to me to lean on to I would have had a massive panic attack. I’ll NEVER fly this airline again it tainted a trip to Rome that was gorgeous and completely ruined the mood every time we had to board one of their planes.

### "plane old but in good condition"
Flight on time arrived early, plane old but in good condition. Very nice crew asking if we need something else. Fantastic flight.

### "Uncaring and hostile"
Not Verified |  4 flights booked from London to Sao Vincente (return) via Lisbon. Second leg of the first flight cancelled the day before and rescheduled 15 hours later. Had to book a new initial outgoing flight on another airline to avoid 17 hrs sitting in Lisbon airport. TAP customer service agreed to refund initial flight. Did not happen. Presented for 2nd flight only to be informed at check in that this flight had been cancelled by the customer service agent following the previous call. Fortunately was able to get on to this flight last minute. Two days before return, unable to check in. Contacted TAP from Sao Vincente. 48 mins later at £2per min, I was informed that both return flights had been cancelled as I had been a "no show", despite the advisor confirming their records were showing that I flew with them only 9 days prior. Flights reinstated. First return flight delayed and connection missed. Was told TAP would put me on another airline if available. When asking for a transfer (now back in Lisbon), the advisor at check in laughed at this suggestion. TAP rebooked me on a flight the following evening - notified of this by text 1 hour after landing back at Lisbon. Luggage could then not be found. Ground Force confirmed that the luggage had arrived safely and had been returned to the luggage belt at arrivals. 3 hrs later, no bag. Told to return the next morning. No food, water or hotel options offered this entire time. Had to rebook an earlier flight on another airline (almost at the cost of the entire initial booking) and pay for a hotel room. Next morning, informed bag was missing and "probably" still in Sao Vincente. Bag located and arrived at Heathrow 2 days later. The only thing worse about this charade, was the behaviour of the majority of the TAP staff I encountered. Uncaring and hostile doesn't even begin to describe some of these interactions. If this sounds like an enjoyable way to spend your time and money, please continue and book with TAP! !

### "eliminated our upgraded seats"
Not Verified |  Terrible TAP! This is the 4th time we have flown with TAP Portugal and it is the 4th time that TAP has eliminated our upgraded seats without notice, after we paid for them. Then they said, at the airport, “there is nothing we can do. You can call TAP to lodge a complaint.” When we checked in they would not allow our check in because we didn’t have the credit card used for purchase readily available, even though we had our passports, printed ticket confirmations, receipts, and other credit cards: all proof of identity. Nothing sufficed. No one helped us. We asked if the agents would call TAP to help and they said they couldn’t. We would have to go to the web. There were no TAP offices at Madrid Terminal 2. This is the fourth time with terrible service.

### "they make flying too complicated"
Not Verified |  I have flown with TAP a few times and each time they make flying too complicated. They say it is for our security and benefit but they are inept and their web site is terrible. To manage your ticket you must have your reference number and name, but then they send you a pin number to access your ticket online. But there is a delay when they send the PIN numbers and when you enter them they don’t work. Then you have to call TAP and they offer excuses. This all takes extra time. They also randomly change and cancel your upgraded seats, after you pay for them. They say it is because they booked other people in the seats or over sold a cabin. But when you show them your confirmed seats on a receipt at check in they simply say, “we don’t have those seats anymore. Someone is occupying them. You can call TAP for a refund.” This is awful service. It has occurred three times. They don’t offer to make accommodations or upgrades. Nothing.

### "food less elaborate than before"
Not Verified |  TAP has been my go to airline for flights to Portugal. The airline has competative business class fares and service is ok. I have flown with them dozens of times always in business class and usually it's fine. The first flight from AMS to LIS was delayed by over an hour because "transportation did not show up at the hotel to pick up the crew, who stayed there overnight". Its the first time I heard that excuse and quite troubling what the background of that probably is. Amsterdam has excellent taxi service that could have kept all this limited to a 10 minute delay, unclear why it took hours and no-one including gate staff was informed. Flight otherwise okay, okayish breakfast tray, seating tight (no empty seat next to you on EMB aircraft) Empty seats in business class were filled with crew on standby tickets who then received plenty of laughs and service from the crew. Lounge in Lisbon closed without prior message from TAP: terrible. Voucher (10E) provided but pretty useless at overcrowded Lisbon Airport. Flight to Funchal on new A321 with fantastic intercontinental seating in business. Full flat beds, full entertainment. Very impressed with the hardware. Flight delayed by almost 2 hours. Good hot meal, wine trolley and quick ok service, empty seats in business again filled with airline staff on stand by tickets. Remote handling at Lisbon is not very premium friendly. Return flight from Funchal over an hour late. TAP's app completely usesless as it does not update you on anything. Flightradar gives you all the info that TAP doesn't. Lounge at Funchal closed without prior message to us the passengers, voucher provided. A319 offers a more sparse business class cabin. But again a full hot meal, best crew out of an otherwise awful team of FA's. In general TAP's crew misses communication skills and a bit of flair, but on this flight we got some personality: great. Last flight LIS to AMS again with A319. Flight on time. Business class full with upgraded TAP staff. Good hot meal. All meal trays by TAP in business look good, I miss pepper and salt, seems that has been eliminated for cost reasons, food also less elaborate than before. Wines in business are really rough, but local, so that part is appreciated. No additional service by crew, who sat in galley doing nothing and make every single announcement sound extremely depressing. on time arrival in Amsterdam.

### "deliberate way to earn some extra cash"
Not Verified |  Had to pay an extra fee of more than the cost of the trip itself for slightly overweight hand luggage. I have never encountered something like that and it seemed this was a deliberate way to earn some extra cash as the scale was rolled in pre departure. Plus the crew was very rude about it, while I calmly asked if something was possible to correct this issue.

### "do not fly TAP Portugal"
My experience with this airline has been an absolute nightmare. My wife and I made 3 reservations from Chicago > Lisbon, Lisbon > Barcelona, and Madrid > Chicago starting Nov. 14th through Nov. 23rd. My wife was unfortunately diagnosed with a tumor and needs emergency surgery, which is on Nov. 17th (overlaps with our trip) so I called TAP Portugal and that is were the nightmare started. First and foremost when you call their customer service line be ready to be placed on hold for at least 1 - 2 hours and prepare for calls to be disconnected after the 2 hour mark. The first time I called I was told to send the doctors letter to their document email, which I did. After not hearing whether the document was approved, which why would it not be approved if the doctors letter specifically states my wife has a tumor and can't travel, I called TAP Portugal who informed me the tickets have been suspended and I would NOT be charged a penalty fee once we rebooked. My wife and I then looked to rebook our trip in April of 2023 and while attempting to rebook our trip with another representative they tell us that the doctors letter was not approved because it did not specifically state my wife had an "oncological disease" therefore a penalty to rebook would be applied. I was honestly appalled but we had the doctor send an updated letter stating the words "oncological disease. We called the day after we sent the updated letter and once again I was on hold for roughly 2 hours then the call disconnected. It's worth noting that I was frustrated throughout my conversations with TAP Portugal but not once was I unprofessional prompting to be hung up on. I then send them an email explaining how unprofessional their customer service team have been and the lack of communication/empathy from the airline. I informed them about the new trip we would like to rebook via email and still to this day I have not heard from anyone. Yesterday I called a representative to confirm if the letter had been approved and to rebook our trip ...bonce again I was on the line for 2 hours while Mark, who has been the most helpful representative out of anyone I have spoken to, attempted to help rebook our trip. While attempting to rebook our trip Mark informed us we would have to pay a total of $1000 on top of what we already paid due to the difference in cost. That same flight he was attempting to book for us in April was much cheaper a couple of days when I requested a phone call but of course I never received a response so after a couple of days later the prices of those flights increased. It doesn't make sense why we would need to pay a bigger difference if the lack of communication is stemming from the airline. To put the cherry on top, after informing the agent at this point we want a voucher or a refund he was speaking and the call disconnected. I cant' explain how terrible this experience has been. We are already dealing with my wife's health and this has made the experience even worse. Unfortunately, I still have not heard back from TAP Portugal. Save yourself the headache, time, and stress and do not fly TAP Portugal, you will regret it.

### "intention to charge people wherever able"
TAP Portugal demonstrate an intention to charge people wherever able. They weighed and measured every single person’s carry-on luggage on entry to the plane. The addition of a last minute decision to check everyone’s carry-on after a certain point as they had run out of space, created an additional layer of chaos. This created a chaotic, disordered loading of the plane, and a late departure. I will not be flying with them again. Outside of the issue with luggage, the staff were great.

### "wanted to be reimbursed for my hotel"
Not Verified |  My flight on Sunday was cancelled from Lisbon to Nice on the 25th September. I was put on a new flight to Nice via Geneva on the 26th September. I was given coupons to eat but no hotel. I was told to check into a hotel and expense the hotel afterwards. I did not expense the food I had in the hotel or that I incurred during the next two days of travel. I just wanted to be reimbursed for my hotel on the 25th as this is what TAP people told me to do. To add to the misery of my trip by the way, on the 26th September, my flight to Geneva was delayed and I missed my connection to Nice. I was then put on another flight to Zurich and put in a hotel and I flew to Nice on the 27th at 7am. So you can imagine how frustrated I was about the miserable trip. All I asked for was to be reimbursed for my hotel at the Melia Hotel in Lisbon on the 25th and some sort of compensation for my travel - a trip that should have taken me 2hours and 15 minutes ended up taking closer to 40 hours. This has still not happened - we are the 14th November and I have heard nothing back yet despite having raised a complaint and kept all my receipts. Disgusting company that shouldn't operate anymore.

### "plane was in top condition"
Flight on time, fantastic crew, the only problem was a very remote stand. The flight went on time, very smooth, also the plane was in top condition.

### "on time with good staff"
It was a fantastic flight, on time with good staff. It was the first time that in a long Haul flight the special meal and the drink came at the same time. Nice for TAP, nice and clean plane.

### "nice girl at boarding gate"
Left Dublin at 04:50ish, thought it was a bit tight expecting to connect in Lisbon onward to Funchal with just over an hour between flights, missed connection that wasn't too big a deal met nice girl at boarding gate who put me on later flight to Funchal (2 hours so ok) but not before meeting TAP's version of Cruella Deville. I suppose every airline's got some.

### "a total embarrassment"
This has to be one of the worst airlines I ever dealt with. I'm currently on the phone with them trying to get the correct voucher # so I can use it for my next flight. This all started in July 2022 when my 14 year old daughter & mom were flying back just to find out that their flight was overbooked. What does that mean? If a ticket was bought why would you overbook a flight? Is there another way of getting on the flight without a seat? Perhaps there is a way to strap travelers to the wings. So with all the confusion at the airport, TAP decided to issue vouchers and put them on the next day flight. Upon arriving at Newark Airport they had lost their luggage. It took 2 weeks to get our luggage back and that was because we called TAP in Portugal numerous times to have them search. Now it's November 11th, I'm currently on the phone with them for over an hour & this is my 2nd call today. I was off today & decided to call them @ 6:30 am. Now the issue is that the voucher they gave my daughter & my mom is invalid. I gave them all the info from what seems to be a voucher but it's invalid. I can't use it online to book a flight for my daughter & the rest of the family. I've been at this for a total of 2 weeks now & the costs of the flights have now increased by about $650. Who is going to pay me for my time? The CEO and other executives should be ashamed of themselves. I work for a multi billion dollar company & I could never be part of such garbage. I'm sad to say that I'm Portuguese & I don't want anything to do with them after this year. I would rather pay more and get it done right the 1st time. It's a total embarrassment. Get your company straight. Contact me if you need me to resign from my job so I can go there and fix this mess for you.

### "the most stressful flight ever taken"
What a stress flying this airline. Orly-Funchal return. What was supposed an all ordinary intra-European flight turned out to be the most stressful flight ever taken. On the way to Funchal, the flight was changed at the last minute and we flew Orly-Porto-Funchal, instead of the original flight via Lisbon which was delayed by several hours. The onboard service is nil. This is a full fare airline and not even water or coffee were offered. On the return, the same dismal service, with a night of transit in Porto. All shops closed. The fear of cancellation and delays made the trip extremely stressful. Please if you want a smooth flight avoid TAP at all costs! This is a full fee airline which has lost it totally and is on the way down.

### "Don't say you weren't warned"
Not Verified |  Today, November 10th, returning from Milan via Malpensa airport, my flight via TAP was scheduled for 6.20 am this morning, without any explanation it was announced that the flight would only leave at 8.40 am. Women, children, families waiting to take off for 2h20 in an aircraft with minimal comfort. In addition to this 2h20 wait, our flight would have lasted another 2h40, so recap, a 2h40 flight turned into a 6h00 flight. Worst of all after taking off the flight attendants with their food and drink carts had the audacity to charge for the food and drink that clearly no one bought. They didn't have the courage to blame themselves for the delay and at least offer Snacks for free. I tell you, Do not fly TAP, fly Lufthansa or even Ryanair for crying out loud. Don't say you weren't warned by this feedback and many others in this review.

### "be very cautious flying with TAP and from Lisbon airport"
My TAP Portugal flight has a long overnight transit in Liston back in October 21st 2022. The next flight to Oslo is 7am the next day. Once I arrived at he airport at 4am (because metro doesn't run this time) by Uber I received a message from the airline that my flight was cancelled. I travel a lot and that was the first time my flight has ever been cancelled by any airline. There was no apparent reason either. The weather was excellent in Lisbon and Oslo. When I looked at the flight board apparently there are others routes too that have been cancelled. I was told this is normal with TAP. I was given another ticket that took me to another long transit in Faro, south of Portugal before flying to Oslo. Both flights had long delays. Another bad thing with Liston airport is they always announce the gate for each flight at the very last minute. You're constantly watching the flight board to make sure you're not late for your flight, I was in Lisbon back in summer too and this happened back then too. I should have remembered that so to be very cautious flying with TAP and from Lisbon airport. Arrived in my hotel at my destination at 4am the day I was supposed to check out. A long 12 hours delay. I'm not sure what happens with the airline or Lisbon airport in general. Avoid either or both whenever possible.

### "regularly late, poor service"
Appalling, regularly late, poor service and amenities and useless customer service. Definitely do not recommend, as it is more expensive than low cost airlines and gives a worse service

### "I am still waiting for my refund"
I've flown TAP in the past with no issues. On this particular flight though, they delayed my baggage. Because we transit in Lisbon, it seems anyone who came from a different destination had their baggage left behind in Lisbon. I don't have to go into detail about the time and effort wasted in the long queues at the airport to lodge a report and the inconvenience not having my baggage for almost a week caused me. However, when I raised a compensation claim, it has taken ages for TAP to assess this. Worse yet, when they finally assessed that they will refund me, they have instead disappeared. Every follow up e-mail I have sent is ignored by the team. It has been 5 months and I am still waiting for my refund. Absolutely shocking. I've dealt with airlines with worse reputations in the same situation and at the very least they admitted their mistakes and compensated me in time. TAP has been a massive disappointment. I'll try to avoid them the next time I fly. This has been unnecessarily stressful and disrespectful.

### "never fly with this company again"
I booked a flight on a business trip, which was later postponed to the summer of 2023. They were completely inflexible about offering credit. You lose 40% of the entire ticket feel, which is absurd for such an easy thing to fix. I made the request 2 weeks out. Their polices are not in favor of giving good experiences to the customers. My guess is that in order to compete with larger Airlines, they must screw you over in other ways and offer cheaper ticket prices. I would never fly with this company again.

### "food good and seats comfortable"
Not Verified |  Our flight was delayed so we were late arriving in Lisbon for our connecting flight. There was an agent waiting for us outside of customs who ran all the way to the gate with us since it was getting ready to close. In today's world I find this very refreshing and am grateful. We would not have made the plane if she had not been there. The staff on the plane was very professional, food good and seats comfortable.

### "worse than the low cost carriers"
TAP Portugal is worse than the low cost carriers like Ryanair and Easyjet. At least with those, you know what to expect, but TAP  Portugal are the sneaky ones waiting to charge you for every small detail making the already-stressful airport experience even bizarre! This Saturday, i was charged €80 because my cabin bag exceeded the weight by 1.5 kg. Even the poor staff were ashamed of it. One way to destroy all of credibility and customer service. Never flying with this laughing-stock of an airline again.

### "worst airline I've ever flown"
This is the worst airline I've ever flown with. Everything is late, the bus the airplane the luggage. The only reason I use TAP is out of lack of a better option. Is this a joke or something? This has happened repeatedly

### "the airline is going through some difficulties"
I have been living in Portugal for the past 4 years now, and I have used TAP with certain frequency, I can tell they are not amateurs, but I can tell the airline is going through some difficulties and the management is not competent. The staff work hard and are helpful most of the time, but the airline is plagued by cancellations and problematic aircraft and infrastructure in Portugal. My flights from Porto to Lisbon are often at least 30 minutes late, so plan ahead if you have a connection. The staff as I said are very friendly most of the time! Planes are well kept. No food unless you want to buy something on board. I do not have much choice but I do hope they find a new buyer and improve the airline capability.

### "worst airline that I have traveled"
The worst airline that I have traveled. The flight was late more than 3 hours and they kept the passenger in the plane for nearly one hour before they take off, after that they even offer a bottle of water. It was the first time that I traveled with TAP and the last time.

### "worst airline I have ever flown"
Not Verified |  This is the worst airline I have ever flown in my entire life. I have a connecting flight in Lisbon from Barcelona to Miami. Once I land in Miami, I have a connecting flight on a separate airline to my home city. But, I’m cutting time a little close on that layover so I obviously didn’t check any bags. I have a roller suitcase that fits the carry on dimensions and a backpack. The first flight from Barcelona to Lisbon goes smooth. I mean it’s the worst plane I’ve ever been on but I had my backpack under my seat, and the roller in the overhead. Upon trying to board in Lisbon for Miami they are weighing suitcases. Mine weighs in at 2 pounds over. They tell me it’s a $125 fee and I must check the bag. I explain to them I have a connecting flight in Miami and I don’t have time to leave the airport to baggage claim, go back through security and make my flight. They tell me that’s not their problem and there is “nothing they can do”. Even though they are allowing every other person who has cameras or film equipment in their bag to just pay the fee, and still bring it in the overhead bin. Overall I have never been treated this poorly by an airline before and am not only sitting on the plane crying right now, but am receiving horribly mean service from the flight attendants as well. We are currently also 20 minutes late for our departure time. They are mean, nasty, scammers.

### "don't care about their customers"
Not Verified |  My last trip with TAP is the worst trip in my life. It's my first trip with this company and it will be the last. They canceled my trip they maid me pay $250 for PCR plus $118 for my checked bag plus $300 to reschedule another trip that will fly after 5 days, I staid in hotel 5 night that cost me $750. I lost 5 days of my vacation plus I paid for the car I reserved in my destination without using it. Bad customer service and rude TAP employees, they lack empathy and they don't care about their customers.

### "Seats are torture - so uncomfortable"
I had a few flights with TAP in September-October 2022. And I will never fly with TAP again. I had to fly from Washington DC to Lisbon and then from Lisbon to Naples on September 15th, 2022 with a few hours stop in Lisbon airport. I had a hotel reservation in Italy beginning September 16th. Each day $400. My "TAP horror" began from the very beginning. They canceled my flight and moved it on September 16th. Besides that they did not provide me connection flight on the same day - I had to stay 2 days in Lisbon to be able to fly to Naples on Sunday, September 18th. My husband called customer service and said we have reservations that we cannot reimburse and we did not plan to stay in Lisbon - that would be additional expenses. They said that they cannot do anything about it and we had to pay for our Lisbon hotel ourselves. So, we lost $1,200 just like that. I am not saying that it took a few days from our vacation that we planned to spend in Italy. While talking with customer service on the day when they canceled our flight we were refused to speak to anyone else and were suggest $25 coupon for future use. What can I say? Food is not free - OK, but water? Seats - are torture - I have never felt so uncomfortable during flight before. My back was hurting 3 more days after that and I am not that old for that. A few words about Lisbon airport - I've seen a lot of international airports - Lisbon airport the worst, do not want to waste much time - it only has one cafe. NEVER, again.

### "forced me to pay 125€ on the spot"
On my TAP Portugal flight, I was picked out in line and asked to check my carry-on bag. This is my Away carry-on that I have used as a carry-on dozens of times, including internationally. The flight crew picked up my bag (without weighing it on a scale) and deemed it “too heavy”. I assumed my bag would be checked for free, but then they took out the payment machine and forced me to pay 125€ on the spot. My bag was already taken away to be checked, so I could not refute the size. This lack of professionalism and explanation of charges ruined my experience. Despite the budget flight prices, I will not be flying TAP Portugal again and will encourage my friends and family to do the same.

### "Star Alliance Gold status is not honored"
In Faro, Star Alliance Gold status is not honored: at check-in a big mess and bad humored attendant, lounge closed, no priority boarding. Truly unbelievable. First flight was late. Lisbon lounge completely packed. Flight attendant on second flight was unadapted to the job, at a ridiculous level. Food (paid) at absurd prices. No w-fi, no entertainment.

### "incredibly unsatisfied"
The worst customer service ever, incredibly unsatisfied. Hopefully nothing happens with your fly, otherwise you will not find anyone to help you. If you lose your luggage good luck with that. It took them 11 days to answer to me without a real information. Probably the worst company I ever traveled with.

### "Terrible follow-up customer service"
Flight was cancelled on the departure day and the next available seat was 2 days later! I had to get a hotel at the last minute at a high rate and missed a food tour that I had already paid for. Terrible follow-up customer service followed by being provided a voucher when I requested a refund. Avoid these folks.

### "flight staff not helpful"
Miami to Lisbon. Very poor service and flight staff not helpful. Seat uncomfortable and no space between passengers. No time to relax and very disorganised. Aircraft not clean and customer service not nice.

### "found the reason not to return my money"
In January 2022 I saw a big sale on TAP Portugal web-site and I decided to buy tickets from Moscow to Madeira via Lisbon. In the February 2022 the airspace between Russia Federation and Portugal closed. In the March I sent a return request and received an approval for that. Since March until October I tried to return my money. Every month I sent letters to TAP Portugal. They answered me and always found the reason not to return my money. I sent my last letter at the end of september and already didn't received my answer. I think that they wouldn't return my money.

### "much stress and inconvenience"
Absolutely unacceptable and violating EU passenger rights. I had a round trip full price business class ticket from Malaga to New York, connecting in Lisbon. So first flight: Malaga to Lisbon, 3 hour connection then Lisbon New York. After confirming the flight and issuing boarding pass the prior day, TAP AIR PORTUGAL cancelled my first flight, Malaga to Lisbon, at 3pm Sunday night prior to 7 am flight. But did NOT propose any alternative and also did NOT cancel the Lisbon to Newark leg!! How can I get to Lisbon within 10 hours on a Sunday night high season, to take my New York flight? Impossible! No help, no explanation, just one SMS: flight cancelled don't go to the airport. I booked this trip through United Airlines website. TAP Portugal should not be allowed in the star alliance or to collaborate with other world airlines, the service they provide is absolutely despicable. I managed to get re-routed, after 2 hours! 2 hours on the telephone with United client support and escalating to supervisor! Arriving at DIFFERENT AIRPORT and 9 hours late so I had expenses for transport, missed meetings, much stress and inconvenience. Absolutely worst experience, I do not recommend TAP Air Portugal if you have a connecting flight to take or if you care about arriving at your destination.

### "do not recommend this airline"
Not Verified |  This is completely unacceptable. I’m in business class. I paid $2400 on this flight from Paris to New York. First I was charged $200 more at check in because she said my carry on was to big when it was super small. Then we had to wait in a really hot area for the bus to pick us up from the airport to take us to the plane. Next when we boarded the bus it had no AC whatsoever on a ride that felt like forever. They literally kept us closed in on the hot bus until the bus In front of us left. Which was literally 2 feet away. We could have waited outside. Then the icing on the cake. We boarded the plane and they start taking our orders for food. They only had 3 options for the main course on the menu which is fine, but they didn't have enough. I’m sitting in row 8. Why when the lady came to take my order she was out of the other 2 dishes. All she had was roasted octopus left. So I literally paid all this money to not have a meal on this 8 hour flight. I am very upset and I do not recommend this airline to anyone at all at all. The plane is nice and comfortable and the staff is nice but the service sucks big time. This is my first and will definitely be my last time flying this airline.

### "definitely not a pleasant experience"
I never had such a bad experience in my life. It all started in my first flight in September 30th, 2022. I had a booked flight from Porto to Dublin, with a layover in Lisbon. The first flight was scheduled at 6pm. We boarded the flight, no worries, but soon enough we were told they were waiting for a delivery of a piece of equipment that they needed to replace as it was malfunctioning, for our safety of course. An hour passed and we were then asked to leave the plane as the equipment was not going to arrive in time for the flight. We waited for hours at the boarding gate waiting for instructions, as there was another flight leaving soon that had the same route, but it was not certain that many people could board in it. They said they would prioritise those with connecting flights, so I thought I had a chance to have my problem solved. That didn't happen and my flight was delayed more than 24 hours. I was not given any place to stay during that time, and was merely told that "the hotels close by were booked and that I could book one myself and send them the receipt later". It was 9:30pm at this time. I am a woman, 22 years old, and obviously was not comfortable to go out there all by myself to find a place to stay at this hour. Thankfully, since I had friends in Porto I was able to solve my issue, and TAP did absolutely nothing about this. I tried contacting them demanding an earlier flight (since I was basically losing a whole day in Dublin due to this) and they had no other options. The next day I went there, the flight from Porto to Lisbon went well, but in the flight from Lisbon to Dublin they had more passengers than what was supposed to and so we had to wait an hour for them to recount the passengers and check each persons boarding pass. My boarding pass had an issue since my seat did not have my name in it, but thankfully nothing happened beyond that. Then we flew and finally arrived at Dublin an hour later than what was scheduled, but thankfully my layover was 2 hours and a half, so there was no issue, and taking into consideration all that had happened before, that was the least of my concerns. Fast forward to my returning flight, October the 3rd. The same problem happened, meaning we had to yet again count all the passengers and the flight was yet again delayed. This time though, my layover was only 1 hour, so I was at risk of missing the next flight (from Lisbon to Porto). Thing is, this flight was delayed, and it only left at 11:50pm (initially it was scheduled to depart at 11:30pm, and since I arrived at 11:30pm it was the perfect time to still be able to make it). Without any explanation whatsoever, my flight was cancelled and rebooked to October 4th, 7am, even though there was a flight that night from Lisbon to Porto. There was absolutely no one at the airport that could help me, everything was closed, no one was there to get me a place to sleep in, and the TAP calling centre obviously could not arrange for a hotel remotely. With that being said, I had to spend the night at the airport, which, needless to say, was absolutely horrible, and definitely not a pleasant experience especially when you are alone, and was something I was not mentally prepared to do. If it had been my decision I would have been prepared, but it was forced on me. TLDR: TAP has absolutely no concern for its customers and has a huge problem with management. I will only fly through TAP in the future if it's the ONLY option available.

### "Worst customer support"
Not Verified | Copenhagen to Lisbon. Worst possible customer support. Haven't been able to get help with my booking and account. There is no-one to talk to that have the knowledge to help with my bookings that fails due to using SAS Eurobonds instead of Miles&Go.

### "TAP simply stands for Take another Airline"
Horrible Airline, never to fly with them again. Hundreds of people were in line to check in and only 2 employees were at the counter. You must check in yourself at kiosks and print your own luggage tags. The luggage belt was not working and delayed us from getting to our gate. We were denied boarding, approx. 22 of us and told to go to the TAP counter in the airport. Long story short, they overbooked tickets and once the plane filled up, they refused us to board. Nightmare for the next 6 hours at the airport trying to understand how this is possible, and where was our luggage. Traveled back to the airport the following day and waited 12 hrs for luggage. Had to purchase new tickets to return home, on a different airline of course. Air Transat! Because TAP simply stands for 'Take another Airline'.

### "day was a nightmare at the airport"
They made a disaster out of my luggage and day. First they forced me to check in bag and ask for 85 euros and refuse to provide me receipt. It was several people surrounding a group of selected passengers forcing this payment. At my surprise I arrive in the plane half empty and space to put luggage. When I landed they lost my luggage. Nobody to talk to and they didn’t care about my situation, they didn’t take any responsibility of what happened. Never again, my day was a nightmare at the airport trying to get my luggage.

### "Very disappointing"
Very disappointing first time flying with TAP - flight attendants did a cursory meal service (tea was served with tepid water in a tiny espresso cup, the sad tea bag floating on top with no hope of becoming a drinkable beverage) and then disappeared - no service beyond asking if i wanted more (tepid) water on top of the sad tea bag - it was an early flight (8am departure) but I had hoped for perhaps an offer to taste some port - there was however no alcohol offered at all; bad luck if anyone was looking for a Bloody Mary Immigration was a mess and so all bags should have been on the carousel - but not mine! I took a number to be helped with filing a report and after about an hour with the queue having made no progress, I walked around all the carousels and found my bag! (I did check to make sure that I hadn't mis-read the signs, but I was correct - the bag simply got delivered to the wrong belt!)

### "never fly with this airline again."
After a 5 hour delay and flight cancellation, a new flight the next day that was also heavily delayed. The worst: no information of any kind. Nobody from tap air present, stewards can't give us any kind of info. Horrible! We will never fly with this airline again. Na 5u vertraging en annulatie van vlucht, een nieuwe vlucht de volgende dag die ook enorm veel vertraging op heeft gelopen. Het ergste: geen enkele vorm van informatie. Niemand van tap air aanwezig, stewards kunnen ons geen enkele vorm van info geven. Vreselijk! Wij vliegen nooit meer met deze organisatie

### "Had a very pleasant flight"
Not Verified |  Had a very pleasant flight from Frankfurt to Lisbon in business class. Flight left and arrived on time. The flight attendants provided good service, Food was better than average. In business class on these short flights the airline simply blocks off the middle seat so that I and my wife had an open seat between us. Leg room was adequate. My only complaint relates to boarding. Usually, business class passengers board the aircraft first, but that was not the case on our flight.

### "they do not care about you"
Not Verified |  We requested a special meal when we purchased tickets. It did not show on our confirmation. We called customer service. They said that the special meal had been added. Upon check-in, the special meal was not there. We called customer service. They said it was too late to add the special meal, and to ask the check-in counter. We spoke to the check-in counter. They said to ask at the gate. We spoke to TAP at the gate. They said to ask on the plane. They also said we could pre-purchase our meal in the terminal and TAP will reimburse us if we do not get our meal on the plane. We asked about the meal on the plane. They said they didn't have it, sorry. At the end of the flight, they realized that they did have the meal, they just had a miscommunication. We submitted a ticket after the flight and got the most useless reply. It said they "apologize for the inconvenience caused", "place the highest value on our Passengers", and also that there's nothing they can do. At the end of the day, I really don't care about the meal. But as you can see, they do not care about you. Be aware that by flying TAP, you're working with a company that refuses any accountability whatsoever.

### "Don’t fly this airline"
Not Verified |  Horrible experience. We only take carryon. When we got to gate, they wanted to weigh our carryon bags. They said they were too heavy & would have to check at gate. The charge was 70 euros per bag for a total of 140 euros. If we had checked originally, there would not have been a charge. Thus, airline collects extra dollars. We left bags with crew at jetway. They assured us bags would get on plane & be first off. We arrived & no bags. How does that happen. We go over to baggage claim & they tell us bags didn’t get on plane & don’t know where or when they will arrive. We fill out claim form & they say will call when arrive. How could this happen!!! The bags where in the jetway & didn’t get on plane after us paying 140 euros. What a scam. Don’t fly this airline.

### "paid for the better experience to not get it"
We actually flew from New York (JFK) to Lisbon to Rome, then Florence, it to Lisbon to Chicago O'Hare, US. Our original light was from Chicago to Lisbon but TAP canceled that so we rebooked departing from JFK. All legs were supposed to be their version of First Class. When we get to JFK and board they stuck us in Economy along with sticking us in economy from Lisbon to Rome. Not sure why because our tickets indicated Premium Seats. So we got screwed on those two legs. Customer service was garbage and might as well have been non-existent. Our departure from Florence, It seemed to be better as they actually boarded us into their first class this time. Our departure from Lisbon was just as nice as they boarded us in their first class on this leg as well. Once we landed in Chicago (late at night) we found out that they lost one of our new suitcases with all of my youngest daughter's clothes. Then the nightmare begins, why? Because customer service is horrible with TAP. I even notified TAP the same night that the suitcase was missing. They told me the next morning that I was supposed to notify the TAP representative at the airport. Well, there was not TAP representative at the airport (we tried that night before leaving the airport). The airport said it was a TAP issue and TAP said it was an airport issue. All I know is that they can supposedly track the bag and find out where it was last 'seen' by the baggage system, yet, nobody has a clue as to where the suitcase is. Our Trip was in May 2022 and we have yet to get any kind of resolution with regards to the lost suitcase and its contents. It is not as if there were not tracking stickers placed all over the bag and that the luggage system does actually track your luggage. But for some reason they just can not locate our suit case in Florence, Lisbon or Chicago. That is amazing to me considering we are in the digital age and everything is tracked at every turn. At one time TAP actually emailed me that the suitcase had been found and actually delivered to me. They only had two addresses: my house and my office. The suitcase was not delivered to either one. I emailed back asking "where" the bag was delivered and have yet to hear back from them (been over two months ago despite me emailing and trying to call several times). The seats were ok in economy but the seats were awesome in what they consider first class (food and drink was much better as well, not to mention the lounge access at the airports). Will I fly them again? Maybe but only if I can fit what I need in carry on bags or actually place apple trackers in the suitcases. Not sure if I can convince my wife to fly with them again. As others have said, it is a cheap ticket. I don't agree that you get what you paid for. I paid quadruple for the better experience to not get it. So, I did not get what I paid for in that respect. I have been flying since I was a kid in the 1970's and have never had a suitcase lost. I am disappointed with them for that reason as well as being placed in the economy section after paying for first class. I would rate the company higher if their customer support was actually decent and one did not have to wait on hold for hours on end to get to talk to someone. To me they lost points for taking my money for first class and then sticking me into cattle car (economy), not letting me into the airport lounge in JFK, losing the suitcase, and customer service.

### "Cheap flight but you get what you pay for"
This will be the last time I fly with TAP. Cheap flight but you get what you pay for. Both my flights from Paris to Lisbon and from Lisbon to Milan were delayed over an hour with no timely communication. For my flight from Lisbon to Milan #826 on Sep 13, the gate agent decided that the flight was full and forced me to check my carry-on over my protest. Once on the flight, I could see several seats were empty so the flight was definitely not full and there was space in overhead bins. I traveled with no checked luggage but ended up having to wait for my carry-on in Milan, adding another half hour on top on the 1.5 hours flight delay. I could also see other other travelers behind me able to walk on the airplane with their carry-ons because they speak Portuguese. Never again, TAP Portugal!

### "stay in Lisbon for nearly 15 hrs"
Before the day of travelling from Brazil got a voucher from them, my son was checked in online and my husband And I need to do the check in at the airport. We are a family of 3, one of us needed to be seated far away with was ok. in Portugal they moved us from a early flight to a night one, without asking if was OK with us, we needed to stay in Lisbon for nearly 15 hrs without any support from them. We tried to book a hotel nearby the airport, unfortunately we couldn't, tried to speak with the TAP in the airport for any lounge so my 7 year old son could rest, the lady told us only for customer that paid for it and was full. Had to put my son to sleep in a chair. Arriving in uk nearly 11 pm and my baggage hasn't arrived until today !

### "Horrible experience at Lisbon airport"
Not Verified | Lisbon to Zagreb. Horrible experience at Lisbon airport. TAP employee stopped me on boarding gate demand that I will pay for luggage, I tried to explain that at check-in I talk to other TAP employee who agree that I don't need to pay. She got so angry, she refused to try talk to that guy and threatened me with loud voice in front of everyone that I have 1 min to pay or I will not go on this flight. I tried to respond but she didn't let me. I was first to check in and 4 hours before my flight at the airport and only by the board gate when I have no other option they forced me to pay or I missed my flight. I paid. I've never ever treated like this. This is not people who can work with other people. Worst humiliating service. I will never go with TAP again, and recommend everyone to stay away from them.

### "Customer service not available"
Not Verified |  Customer service not available! The way the customer is treated is actually not even worth one star. My luggage got lost and all you get is a lousy printout with your reference number and a few meaningless promises. If you want to reach customer service, you first hang in a queue for ages, only to be dealt with as quickly and vaguely as possible. If you then ask where you can claim reimbursement for the extra costs incurred, you are not forwarded as promised, but thrown off the line. It doesn't matter which call agent you have on the line. I think it's probably intentional. Now that my luggage has finally been found, they can't even give me a certain time slot for the delivery, but instead tell me to wait for my luggage until 10 p.m. After that, the usual ejection from the line came again. Empathy is also non-existent with this ‘customer service’. Rarely have I seen so much incompetence and ignorance. Once and never again  Kundenservice nicht vorhanden! Die Art und Weise, wie mit dem Kunden umgegangen wird ist eigentlich nicht mal einen Stern wert. Mein Gepäck ist verloren gegangen und alles, was man erhält ist ein lausiger Ausdruck mit seiner Referenznummer und ein paar nichtssagenden Versprechen. Will man den Kundenservice erreichen, hängt man zuerst ewig in der Warteschleife, um dann so schnell und vage wie möglich abgefertigt zu werden. Wenn man dann danach fragt, wo man die Erstattung für die entstandenen Extrakosten einfordern kann, wird man nicht, wie versprochen, weitergeleitet, sondern aus der Leitung geworfen. Dabei ist es auch egal, welchen Call Agent man an der Leitung hat. Ist meines Erachtens wohl so gewollt. Jetzt, da mein Gepäck letztendlich wohl gefunden wurde, kann man mir noch nichtmal ein gewisses Zeitfenster für die Zustellung geben, sondern verlangt, dass ich bis 10 Uhr abends auf mein Gepäck warten soll. Danach, kam wieder der übliche Rauswurf aus der Leitung. Empathie ist bei diesem ‘Kundenservice’ auch nicht vorhanden. Ich habe selten soviel Inkompetenz und Ignoranz erlebt. Einmal und nie wieder

### "unimpressed by the attitude and service"
A very mixed experience on this trip with TAP. The Manchester to Lisbon flight on the E195 was pretty good. Had front row seat with plenty of leg room. Long wait before seat belt off signs and breakfast but food not bad and service efficient. Layover in Lisbon quite short and made more stressful due to having to be bused to terminal. Lisbon to Cancun flight was on the new A330-900 plane with the lie flat business seats in a 1-2-1 configuration. Again, we were bused to plane which sort of defeats the priority business class lave at the gate. No welcome on board whatsoever, no welcome drink .. basically it was fend for yourselves which for business class passengers paying thousands of pounds for their tickets is not acceptable. All the cabin crew in the business class section were, lets say, of the more experienced type and as such had no personality at all and pretty much ignored the passengers around them, apart from officiously ensuring masks were worn. The seat is comfortable although the controls are not at all intuitive and the space for your feet once reclined is very limited. Food was good although served after a long wait and then all at the same time. Wines were excellent as was port with the cheese but after the meal service there was absolutely no service from the crew whatsoever. No enquiring whether you needed anything and certainly no offer of extra drinks. They simply hid away behind the curtains until the pre arrival snack made an appearance. This was tasty. On landing it was obvious that they were glad to be finished and off to their hotel. Very poor service. My checked bag did not arrive with me and I did not get my bag until day 4 (there were at least 20 other passengers without bags behind me in queue). Getting hold of bag handler to check on status in Cancun was impossible and I feel lucky to have actually got my bag delivered to me. In transit, 4 shirts and an aftershave had been stolen to compound matters. Return flight check in was chaos with the premium lane being used to check in a family group in economy resulting in me and other premium passengers having to check in at the economy desk. Lounge at Cancun (not TAP's) was excellent. Same shoddy 'service' on return flight with again, decent food and a very good entertainment selection. Lounge in Lisbon (TAP lounge) had everything you could need but not enough seating, cafeteria like set up and very poor toilets. Premium boarding for LIS/MAN flight was handled well and a very warm welcome from a couple of, lets say, less experienced, enthusiastic cabin crew. Plenty of space for a A320 plane and a three course meal (with a choice and menu card) and a good selection of drinks. In fact they were extremely attentive with the wine bottle even telling me I had plenty of time for another glass before landing. This last flight shows that TAP can get things right but it mostly comes down to the cabin crew. Putting your near end of service crew on your "Blue Ribband" routes is not going to win you future business, Put the younger enthusiastic crew on these routes and you will see your ratings go up. I'm not holding out for much of a positive outcome to my delayed baggage claim and I was very unimpressed by the attitude and service of the long haul cabin crew however this is not a 1 star carrier as so many other reviewers state (I have flown over 400 times worldwide and have come across plenty of these). Overall, not bad value for money.

### "disgusted by the lack of communication"
I am disgusted by the lack of communication or any form on consideration from this airline. Our fights were changed from American to TAP due to a delay and our bags were carried by the American Airline Crew to TAP terminal with the new rerouted tags on them. I was physically there when the woman from American Airlines made the phone call to inform them to place our bags on their flight. Also, I double checked with a woman from TAP to ensure that our luggage would be carried over, she looked at our boarding pass like it had ten eyes and then confirmed that there would be no issues with the bags. Surprise, suprise- the bags never made it to our destination. American airlines confirmed the following day via phone that they were with TAP airlines and never left Boston, therefore the bags were not missing and that since we filed a claim TAP should send them over to our destination. Our online claim status never changes form "lost luggage, still searching" the 12 days we were there, despite the bags location being known in Boston. It is clear that not a single person even looked at the claim or made any attempt to send the luggage over. When we arrived back at Logan Airport after our 12 day trip the girl at the TAP desk seemed to know exactly which bags we were talking about-"Oh yeah, there are two bags in our office with a tag to Venice. When I asked her why there was no attempt to contact us(my name and address were on the bag as wel as on the claim filed) they made up false excuses and tried to put the blame on American Airlines. The girl and man behind the desk at Logan Airport also lied and claimed that the bags were delivered to them only hours before we arrived (which is false because it was confirmed they were with TAP 12 days prior) and that they were taking so long to be brought up to us because they had to go through customs, which is clearly a lie because they never left Boston to begin with. When I called TAP during my trip to get answers a woman answered the phone and I explained the situation, she then put me on hold for hours and never came back. The complete lack of communication, zero attempt to send over the luggage, and zero accountability for their incompetence is absurd.

### "comfortable and pleasant"
Not Verified |  I'm writing after being hand delivered my missing luggage 2 days after landing! This was my first time losing my luggage, so I was a bit upset at TAP Air for whatever it was that happened. In the process of reporting the loss, I had difficulty with the online portals, which I will say seemed not to be functioning at the time. The portals said that my bag tag code was invalid which made me very worried that the tag would not be scanned correctly making recovery almost impossible. However, I am very very thankful and happy for the recovery serviced by TAP Air. A very nice TAP Air employee at ORD named Tamer and his colleague Jendo helped me when I couldn't find the TAP Air O'hare office. The helped me manually enter the lost baggage report and took note of my name. They were also great company in a stressful time!! Two days later, as I was about to drive 2 hours to O'hare Airport to inquire to Jendo or Tamer again about the bag, my luggage was delivered to my front door! Though TAP Air may need to fix some bugs on their online portal, and though the baggage was lost in the first place, I am so pleased with the recovery. I will travel again and pack lighter so as to only have a carry on! Finally, my 8 hour flight from Lisbon to Chicago was comfortable and pleasant. I have no complaints about anything during the travel. The seats were decently roomy with USB chargers and decent dinner! Moreover, the price was VERY cheap, which of course makes TAP Air desirable to fly with. I wouldn't be scared, but I would say take a carry on if you can, or purchase a luggage tracker (I will be doing this)

### "I am appalled and angry"
We were disappointed and will never fly with TAP Portugal again. We booked specific business class  seats so my partner and I could be together. However upon entering the flight, without any prior communication whatsoever we were displaced. We were ordered to sit at completely different seats and were at the other side of the cabin. We couldn't even talk to each other. Aside from this I am appalled and angry with how the purser dealt with the situation. She was rude and aggressive and treated me like a spoilt child when I asked why this was happening while I was only asking for my right and looking for a solution. She then just walked away and ignored me. It was a horrible flight. I've not been treated like that by anybody since I passed the age of 14. Moreover we received news our return connecting flight was changed - we now had a stopover of 5 hours in Lisbon. While there was another earlier flight leaving. But we were denied access to that flight. Again while we paid for expensive business class tickets. We then had to stay in the horrible 'vip lounge' in Lisbon. How do they dare to call this a lounge? It looks and smells like a kindergarten canteen. The design is horrible, the seats are cheap and uncomfortable, the food is disgusting and the toilets were a mess.

### "shame about the delays"
We flew to Salvador with TAP in the middle of July from Amsterdam through Lisbon, in the midst of a personnel crisis. The tickets they sold us included an overlay in Lisbon - 55 minutes on the way there and 1 hour 20 minutes on the way back. Due to delays we missed our overlays both times (on the way there and back). On the way to Salvador we had to wait for 24 hours until the next plane. TAP gave us vouchers for food (16 euro pp for 24 hours), taxi (the voucher wasn't valid and I spent a long time trying to convince the receptionist at the hotel that it was supposed to work) and overnight stay (this worked, and the hotel was nice). On the way back to Amsterdam we were put on the closest flight, which we had to run for. Overall, of course, the experience was unpleasant. But they reimbursed everything according to the European regulations (600 euro pp per delay) without making a fuzz or us having to go to an intermediary company. This decency has to be acknowledged, thank you! Next time, I wish they don't schedule such a tight connection for a transatlantic flight and provide valid vouchers. The planes were modern, the movie selection was excellent. I really appreciate the headrest with bendable wings that hold your head in place. Overall, shame about the delays, but I am willing to admit that it wasn't entirely their fault.

### "forced me to gate check my carry-on bag"
Worst airline I’ve ever had the misfortune of using. They forced me to gate check my carry-on bag because they overbooked their flight. Then they lost my bag for my entire trip. That bag had all my clothes for the week, including a tuxedo for my brother’s wedding. I had to spend hundreds of dollars are replacement formal wear. The people at TAP couldn’t care less that they lost my luggage. When I called, it was one bored customer service rep after another telling me they couldn’t help me, giving me other numbers to call that couldn’t help me or saying they were going “transfer me to another department” & then hanging up on me. I only managed to find my bag by going to the airport at the end of my trip & manually searching the lost & found. I never received any help, accountability, or even an apology from the airline. In fact, I’m still getting emails from them about how they can’t help me, which indicates that they don’t even know I managed to get my bag back from them without their help. TAP is a disgrace & you should literally use any other airline instead of them. If I can convince even one of you readers not to fly on their awful, incompetent airline, I’ll consider it a good day’s work.

### "flight I booked had been canceled"
I am deeply upset with recent experience with TAP Air and will never fly with them again. I booked a flight on TAP Air's website from Lisbon to GVA (Switzerland) for two passengers for a total of 53,40 GBP. I received a confirmation email shortly after confirming my booking. When I booked the flight, I received a pop up message saying that my credit card would need to be confirmed. This confused me, so I went on the TAP website and read that, sometimes, TAP will require credit card verification at the airport upon arrival. Upon arrival I tried to check in at the kiosk area and was told that I didn't have a reservation. I was then sent to the TAP service desk. After collecting a ticket and waiting in line for 45 minutes I was told that my booking confirmation email actually DID NOT mean that my booking was confirmed. There was an issue on TAP air's end and my flight reservation was cancelled, even though I did not receive an email from the airline that the flight I booked had been canceled. I was then told that I could purchase the flight, but it would cost not double, not triple, not five times, but over 8 times the price that I had booked the tickets for. I paid 523.22 Euro for the new tickets— absolutely outrageous. I asked the customer service representative if the price I had originally booked the flight for could be honored. She said it was not possible to do this. Because my partner and I had already booked other flights and had a tight travel schedule, we were forced to pay this outrageous price for the new tickets. Do not fly with TAO.

### "actively avoiding flying with TAP in future"
Onboard the outbound flight, service long haul was poor. To only offer a drinks service with twice (and only because this was meal time) on an 8 hour flight is not a good standard, when crew are asked for drinks outside this time it was met with attitude. Even when provided, drinks are in small cups and selection is limited. Lisbon as a transfer hub is completely inadequate and not fit for purpose, the airport is very small and limited food and drink options mean that the ones available are extremely overcrowded. Most aircraft are served by bus service and staff aren’t good. They even had us about to board the wrong aircraft! On the return leg, this was delayed by almost 4 hours, the check in agents were rude, and not apologetic at all, the help provided by the airline in terms of water and snacks, over what is a main meal time was extremely disappointing, overall a level of service much lower than would be expected of a star alliance member airline, I will be actively avoiding flying with TAP in future

### "The worst airline to fly"
The worst airline to fly. From lost luggage and when returned weeks later, my bags were damaged. No apology. Still waiting for my refund for the toiletries and clothes I had to purchase.

### " force me to put my bag in the hold"
Not Verified |  To begin with their own website messes up our booking so we arrive 11 hours later than what we actually booked. We then spend almost 4 hours to get through to their "customers service" that the asks for 60 euros to correct the mistake they made. We decline to pay for their mistake and end up taking the flights they gave us. The flight is one hour delayed to begin with. You cant choose your own seats so we are squeezed on a four seat row. My food was not edible. We arrive in Lisbon airport where we go out of the plane just to spend 30 minutes waiting in a bus on the runway before it goes to the gate. Lisbon airport is probably the worst airport in the world. No organization at all, rude staff. To get the stamp in your passport I was in line for almost 3 hours in a line. Our next flight to Copenhagen is after a 10 hours wait. They force me to put my bag in the hold and even tried to make me pay for it even though it met all the specifications needed. I ended up not paying but had to wait an additional hour for my bag in Copenhagen. On this last flight you have to pay for water. The legroom is  little and the seats are like rocks.

### "I will never be flying TAP again"
Not Verified |  I will never be flying TAP again. I flew from FAO to Lisbon and then onto JFK. At FAO at the check in desk the lady asked me if i wanted to check my 2 carry on bags for free. I told her i will only check the 1 carry on since it was free. She did not weigh either of my bags. We land in Lisbon. About to board our flight and the lady tells me to weigh my carry on. It’s 5 pounds over what a carry on bag is supposed to be and i need to now pay €125. What?? That is absolutely ridiculous. The staff at FAO should of weighed all our baggage and made this clear. Boarding was an absolute nightmare and completely unorganized. Everyone was nasty and clearly didn’t want to be there. Needless to say. I will never be flying TAP again

### "TAP just gets worse and worse"
Not Verified |  TAP just gets worse and worse. Their booking system is confused and designed only to rip customers off. Forget using Star Alliance points with them for upgrades as they simply don’t accept them however long in advance you try - I tried 2 years without success. This is a very poor reflection on Star Alliance as a whole and they really need to grip TAP’s dismissal of other Star Alliance points clubs. Check in at Lisbon couldn’t be worse even for Business Class where queues are long and staff rude. The flights themselves are almost always late and they go cheap with gates so expect to be as far away as possible and probably via an overcrowded bus. Business class onboard is akin to an average economy class - poor food and absolutely no service from the cabin crew,don’t bother asking for a drink - they don’t like providing drinks outside of meal times and their response will be rude. And finally baggage handling - I think the worst I have come across. An awful airline that is ripping its customers off and simply doesn’t care. Ryanair is much better!

### "real issue was the flight was 2+ hours delayed"
I flew TAP on Sunday, July 31, 2022 from Lisbon to Toronto on TAP257. I had flown TAP before and had sat in Economy in the Emergency row to get a little added leg room for an additional fee in June 2022. I wanted to try Business Class on this return trip as I laid over in Lisbon after flying Emirates to Asia and back through Dubai on July 30, 2022 to Lisbon. The flight itself was okay. The Business Class was subpar comparatively. Food was about the same as in Economy. The configuration is 2-1-2 aside seating in Business. The legroom was awful and suggest avoiding the single berth seats. Ingress and Egress was less than 10 inches. The foot wells in single berth Business are tiny and cramped. There are no armrests and your arms rest on metal "pods" (which are the foot wells for the twin seat berths). The real issue was the flight was 2+ hours delayed. They loaded us on to Buses 20 minutes after boarding had commenced which held about 60 folks each to move us to the Aircraft which was parked out by a maintenance hangar. Covid protocols be damned it looked like by TAP. The Bus I was on (first one) had graffiti all over it and no working Air Conditioning. We sat under the gate waiting to be ferried for 30 minutes in 30C+ temperatures on the tarmac on the bus it hit 33C as packed as we were. The then moved us to the aircraft. The buses sat in the sun next to the aircraft for 45 minutes with no Air Conditioning and doors closed for another 45 minutes. The bus driver got off while we were forced to stay on the bus. Temperature in he bus hit 37C. We all had masks on (Covid protocol) restricting breathing and when my heart rate hit 130BPM after about 30 minutes on the sweltering bus on the tarmac next to the plane, I decided it was time to act for my own health. I moved to the rear exit and pushed the emergency release and got off pulled down my mask on the tarmac to breathe and slow down my heart rate. I was greeted a few moments later by the ground handler and bus driver (who had been walking around enjoying the fresher air all of that time) at the rear of the bus and I asked if they understood how negligent TAP was being by locking seniors, children and adults on a packed bus for over an hour. They whined at me that they were just doing what they were told to which I said, you are being incompetent and I offered to show them the recorded temperatures and my heart beats on my Galaxy watch. With the rear door open some folks joined me on the tarmac and I was happy to at least get a little airflow onto the bus for those that stayed on the bus. About 15 minutes later we were told to board the aircraft (stairs). When I got on I was greeted with a half small cup of warm water and an apology as were the other passengers. 2 hours+ after the scheduled departure we were taxiing to the runway for our flight. Pilot came on and apologized for the delay and said it was "uncoordinated" events between the ground staff and flight crew that caused the issue as the plane had technicians on it when the boarding was started by the ground crew as the aircraft had just come out of maintenance. No other apology. I don't blame the flight crew.

### "canceled my flight not even 12 hours before"
I was supposed to fly but airline canceled my flight not even 12 hours before and re booked me onto a new flight that was already full and when I got to the airport to check in I was unable to and denied boarding. I was on line with an agent for over 40 minutes and no results. had to end up spending money out of pocket towards bus and Uber rides at least 100 extra dollars to get to another airport to take the next flights through a partner airline.

### "our baggage never made it"
On July 22 at 3:55 am we boarded the flight from Lisbon to Tangier. Little did we know that we would lose their baggage. We waited a few hours in Lisbon only to realize our baggage never made it. We filed a claim with Ground Force (the company TAP outsources these claims to) and the customer service from both companies has been horrible. Myself and others from the flight have been emailing and calling every day confused how they could lose hundreds of bags at once and have zero tracking / zero idea about where they are. We even sent a friend to the airport in Tangier to search. Neither company seems to care about the situation & I’m shocked they’re still in business with such an awful reputation. Either take your items as carry on or don’t use TAP at all.

### "we still have no luggage"
My husband and I traveled to London for a 14 day Anniversary cruise. When we arrived at the airport in Miami we were informed that our flight was delayed, but not to worry that we had plenty of time to make our connection in Lisbon. We specifically asked to change our connecting flight to make sure we did not have any issues. The ticket agent in Miami said that was not necessary, that we were going to make our connection because the terminal was very small in Lisbon. He omitted to say that you need to take a bus from the tarmac to the terminal. Needless to say we missed our connection. We were put on another flight to London and assured by the ticket and gate agents that the bags were on our flight. Upon our arrival in London we discovered that our bags were not on our flight and they had no idea where they were. To make a long story short we are on the 5th day of our cruise and we still have no luggage or any contact from TAP Airlines.

### "stay away from this nasty airline"
San Francisco to Barcelona via Lisbon. This is the worst airline I have come across and I have traveled a lot in my lifetime. Their customer service is outrageous. Their on board staff is rude and I feel like they went out of their way to provide extremely poor quality meals. They lost my luggage, when I reached Barcelona from San Francisco, it was missing. I made an online report, I could not stand in line cause about 39 people, one of the airport staff said had their luggage missing on my flight alone, the line was long and it would be too late for me to travel to my hotel late at night, they suggested I make an online complaint. My luggage reached there according to TAP after 5 days, I couldn't pick it up, I was already on a tour to Portugal. I requested them to drop it to my residence in Sacramento area. They refused and they said it's not their responsibility. It took hours of being on hold to finally get in touch with them. They said ask the airport to drop it off. When I called the airport, they said they are surprised this airline is still in business. They have had many many complaints. They have "misplaced" a lot of bags and it's their responsibility to deliver it to customers home, not the airport. I have made several attempts to get my luggage, now they tell me they can't find it at all. Please stay away from this nasty airline.

### "worst airline I ever dealt with"
TAP Portugal is the worst airline I ever dealt with. On July 6th I traveled this airline from Dulles to Lisbon i missed my connection due to flight delay. They scheduled my family and i to stay in Lisbon for 24 hours to catch another flight. We could not do that because we were heading to Paris the next day. So they put us on a Paris flight, but when we got to Paris we had no bags. I was missing bags for 3 days before my cruise in Barcelona. My Godfather was missing his bags for 11 days. He got it once he returned from the cruise. We also flew TAP coming back from Barcelona to Dulles on July 17 they have lost 2 bags, still no answer to where they are. TAP do not really communicate with their customers you have to email a complaint . Have not gotten call on resolution or compensation. You can do what you want but do not say I did not tell you.

### "my luggage did not travel with me"
Booked business class flight, Manchester to Lisbon. Flight was good, only 20 mins delay, however my luggage did not travel with me and TAP Portugal cannot locate the case and now want me to travel onto Boston for a three week work secondment with no case. TAP Portugal will not allow me to return hone, change or delay my Boston trip without forfeiting my ticket cost. The customer service has been quite appalling not to mention extremely upsetting. I cannot believe a supposedly international airline can treat people in this way. I so wished I had read the TAP reviews before booking my flight.

### "terrible treatment received from their employees"
On June 30 my TAP flight 433 from Paris to Lisbon was delayed 3:30 hours and because of that, we missed our connecting flight with the same airline to JFK (New York). In addition to the terrible treatment received from their employees in the terminal, they sent us to customer service where we waited our turn for 5 hours to tell us that they had no more vouchers available for hotel, food or anything for us. In fact, at that time (11:30 at night) we were informed that the claims of the suitcases had closed and we could not look for them, therefore, they left us without any clothes or anything to spend the night. We were 5 people with 3 different reservations where we had an older person and a diabetic person who uses insulin with medication in their bags and their employees responded that it was not their problem. They literally closed the door of the customer service in our face and a manager began to scream to all the people there that was not their problem and were solved. We had to pay, for hotel, food, and transportation among others. Our flight on July 1 TAP 433 from LIS to JFK was delayed more than 3 hours. The worst service they’ve ever given me in my life, they gave it.

### "not received a reply to any of my e-mails"
The flight we took from Amsterdam Schiphol departed 3.5 hours late (23:00 instead of 19:30). The lounge closed at 20.00, leaving us in the terminal for 3 hours and TAP staff was nowhere to be found. The delay resulted in missing our onwards flight, spending the night in Lisbon and made us miss the first day of our holiday. Two and a half months after filing a complaint and asking for EU compensation I still have not received a reply to any of my e-mails.

### "another lie to tell customers"
Tenerife to Chicago via Lisbon. Me, my Czech girlfriend (USA) and our baby (Czech/US) were traveling with TAP Portugal from Tenerife to Chicago. First we spent more than hour on check-in in Tenerife, because the guy there told me, that my ESTA is not linked to their system, even though it was valid, which can be checked on official US government website. He kept saying, that they have problem with my ESTA and cant give us boarding passes to Chicago. After more than an hour we got at least boarding passes to Lisbon and were able to fly there with a promise, that he talked to the TAP staff from Lisbon and they will print our boarding passes there, since he can't do it, because he's not official employee of TAP, just an external work force. When we got to Lisbon, we immediately contacted TAP staff at information, after 20 minutes of checking my ESTA the guy told me, that we should just go to the gate, they know about us and print the boarding passes for us there. We finally got to the gate, more than an hour prior the department, but were told, that they can't give us the boarding passes. It took about 5 people running around with our passports for an hour, handing them one to another, when finally the plane departed and we weren't allowed to board it. At the end, they gave us back ONLY 2 PASSPORTS! So I told them, they had 3, which finally they found it and gave it to me. The fault was on their part (their system), which they accepted. At the end the woman told us, that they could have printed our boarding passes but they didn't have enough time to do it. I don't understand, 5 people were running around, investigating my ESTA, which would take 5 minutes, and they didn't have time to print our boarding passes?? That was outrageous! So we were stuck at the airport with a 7 month old baby, just sitting on the floor for hours before they gave us new flight without any consultation about transfers etc. We didn't get even enough vouchers to cover the cheapest meal and we didn't get our bags back. We could get them, but the guy said, that it would take another 2-3 hours and it was already way past our baby's bed time, since we spent at the airport almost 7 hours of dealing with TAP staff. They told us, that if we won't take our bags, they will arrive to the final destination with us and as you can guess, when we got finally to Chicago, our bags weren't there. So we didn't have a baby stroller, baby car seat or clean clothes 2 days for our baby while on the way and than another 2 days of waiting for bags in Chicago. At the airport we asked the women at the gate if we can get a confirmation from her, that they didn't let us board our plane because of their system failure and she assured us that she will give it to us at the end. As you can guess it was just another lie to tell customers in order to not make them angry and at the very end when we were tired and worried about our baby, she told us that she actually cant do it and we have to contact them via website. It was nearly 10pm, baby was really tired and uncomfortable, so we just didn't want to deal with it anymore and left. After more than a month of filing complaint, we haven't heard back from TAP. If you fill complaint there's just a limited amount of things you can upload, so we could not upload and claim all our expenses.

### "The worst airline by far"
Not Verified |  The worst airline by far. They are very old school and still make you wear a mask on the plane. They made me weigh my small carry on bag and made me pay $125 because it was over weight apparently by 2kgs. On top of that they were late and made people wait for for over an hour at the check-in area. There was no one to take peoples’ bags, we were all just standing there. There is 0 communication from the airline and they rip you off. As a side note, there was water dripping on my leg on the plane that was coming from the AC. Very disappointed, never flying with this outdated airline ever again.

### "I will never fly with TAP again"
Not Verified |  Flight booked from Amsterdam to Málaga via Lisbon, only 1 hour transfer time. Just to be sure, I called whether that transfer time would be sufficient "no problem sir, the next flight is usually waiting with a small delay". You guessed it because of the problems at Schiphol such as no driver available for the push-back car, missed our slot and left almost 2 hours later. During the landing I switched on my mobile to look on flight radar for our next flight to Málaga, which was just taking off at that moment. After the gate there was a lady from TAP with a new boarding card for the flight the next morning, 9 hours later and some consumption vouchers. Unfortunately they couldn't offer us a hotel stay because all the hotels were occupied. We had to see for ourselves whether we could find a hotel and afterwards declare the costs via the website. Finally found a hotel not far from the airport, €200. Didn't really sleep because of a pop concert right in the courtyard of the hotel. Arrived on time in Málaga the next morning. Declaring hotel costs and delays (€300 pp) is very difficult. They are difficult or impossible to reach by phone. And how long it will be before we get our money back (if we ever get it back) no one can tell us. I will never fly with TAP again. Vlucht geboekt van Amsterdam naar Málaga via Lissabon, slechts 1 uur overstaptijd. Voor de zekerheid nog gebeld of die overstaptijd wel voldoende zou zijn "geen probleem meneer, de volgende vlucht blijft veelal wachten bij een kleine vertraging". Je raadt 't al vanwege de problemen op Schiphol zoals geen bestuurder beschikbaar voor de push-back wagen, ons slot gemist en bijna 2 uur later vertrokken. Tijdens de landing m'n mobiel vast aangezet om op flight radar te kijken naar onze volgende vlucht naar Málaga, die op dat moment net opsteeg. Na de gate stond er een dame van TAP met een nieuwe boardingcard voor de vlucht de volgende ochtend, 9 uur later en wat consumptie bonnen. Helaas konden ze ons geen hotelovernachting bieden want alle hotels waren bezet. We moesten zelf maar kijken of we een hotel konden vinden en naderhand via de website de kosten declareren. Uiteindelijk een hotel gevonden niet ver van de luchthaven, €200. Niet echt geslapen vanwege een popconcert precies in de binnentuin van het hotel. Volgende ochtend optijd aangekomen in Málaga. Declareren van hotelkosten en vertraging (€300 pp) gaat zeer moeizaam. Ze zijn telefonisch niet of nauwelijks te bereiken. En hoelang het gaat duren voordat we ons geld terug krijgen (als we het al ooit terugkrijgen) weet niemand ons te vertellen. Ik vlieg Nooit meer met TAP.

### "the worst i have taken so far"
First, the flight was 3 hours late from nyc to Lisbon, which happens. Second, when we arrived in Lisbon we missed the connecting flight because they post gate numbers about 20 minutes before the flight a takes off. by the time we reach the next flight it was too late. Third, they placed us in the next flight to Toulouse, but because we missed the connecting flight out of no where the company cancelled my returning flight a few minutes later. Thank god, i had the presence of mind to check my email to see it. Fourth, I had to get back to a long line  to fix the problem. The desk person who was very nice, didn't understand why they did that but managed to fix it. Fifth, my luggage didnt follow me even though while i was rebooking the next flight, they guaranteed me it was going to be in my flight. I called all the numbers to try to locate my luggage and every time i spoke to someone they gave me a new number to call. They don't even transfer you, they give you the number you have to call. Most of them take about 30 min to pick up. Finally, its been 5 days and i'm still waiting for my luggage. i keep checking the online checker but i get the same message every single time. I am very worried because their site says that they usually manage to locate a luggage within 72 hours. Overall, this company is the worst i have taken so far and i travel twice a year for the past 25 years.

### "TAP disappointed at every step of our journey"
Avoid this airline unless no other option is available. From the initial reservation experience online to the impossible process of trying to get a customer service representative on the phone to correct booking and billing mistakes, TAP disappointed at every step of our journey. Both on ground and in flight staff is dismissive at best and outright insulting at worst. None seem to have had even the basic training in customer relations. The airplane was fine, and relatively new, but very basic. No frills here. Otherwise, TAP truly succeeded in making the travel part of our holiday miserable. This is truly a very poorly run airline.

### "canceled my flight about an hour before we were set to take off"
Not Verified |  Do the world a favor, and let TAP go bankrupt. They canceled my flight about an hour before we were set to take off, and did not even have any staff members in the terminal to give us information or a new flight, so now I am stuck in Madrid with no information, no refund, and no way to get home. No response from TAP Portugal, or what to do next. Their staff are arrogant and will feed you false information just to ward off angry customers. The world does not need this airline, do not ever book flights with TAP.

### "I will never fly TAP ever again"
I will never travel with TAP Air Portugal ever again. Nothing to do with the canceled flight & the delay, but everything to do with the response from the airline, the lies at the airport to keep us quiet, the treatment we received and the lack of communication. Our initial flight out of EWR to AMS with layover in LIS: flight cancelled and 0 communication from airline: not a text, a phone call, an email. I was lucky to find it out before leaving for the airport because I just googled if the flight was delayed and it showed it was canceled. TAP rebooked us without ever even informing us of the canceled flight or of the different options we had. On the way back, the initial leg AMS to LIS was delayed. The flight attendant told us that we would have about 40 min to go through customs and get to the gate. by miracle we are able to reach the gate, boarding passes on hand, that they were still boarding passengers. we were group A and TAP was boarding group B. Once we get to the front of the line to scan our boarding passes we are told that they canceled our tickets and gave our seats to other passengers. Why? No response. Then they place us as Standby passengers at the end of the line of Standby passengers and we do not make it onto our flight. we are stranded in Lisbon even though we made it to our gate. The staff there was very dismissive. they gave us voucher for the hotel and dinner and booked us on another flight the following day. they told us we would get compensated for the missed flight and not in the form of a voucher but cash. once home we try to get it and we were told we can only get travel vouchers. no thank you. I will never fly TAP ever again.

### "guarantee I will never fly TAP again"
We flew as a family. My wife, my daughter, and me. We had 1:20 in Lisbon for the connected flight. However, the plane was already delayed three hours when we left Copenhagen. So we missed our connection. First we received a message we were booked for a new flight more than 24 hrs later. But after we stood in line for more than an hour, we got transferred to a flight later the same evening at 22:00. Then we thought the worst was over. But I was wrong. When we arrived in Madrid, our luggage was gone. That can happen. So we reported it. As I write, we have still not received it. Five days has passed. Every time we call TAP they ask us to call someone else and/or they can’t help us. They are taking no responsibility. At all. I had to stand in line for four hours in the airport, to be told the same all over again. I can guarantee I will never fly TAP again. The plane was fine. The personal on board was fine. But the way they take care of their passengers, when things go wrong is ridiculous.

### "A paid carry on is not the same as a paid carry on on other airlines"
I booked a flight and paid extra for the carry on bag and a checked bag. I did not use the checked bag and had a small roller bag within the required dimensions. At the gate, they had a scale to weigh bags. Mine was about a kg over the 8 kg limit. I asked to remove an item such as book or jacket to wear and he said too late. Pay 80 euros or don’t board the flight. I was horrified at how rude and abrupt he was. He then said because it was overweight, it had to be gate checked as hold luggage. I couldn’t take it in the cabin even though it fit in their sizing bin. I told him I had paid for the carry-on and an unused checked bag but he said too late. It had to be outside security. Pay again and pay 80 more. There were plenty of other people with bags bigger than mine that he didn’t care about too. On top of that, the flight left 80 minutes late departing and arrived in London after the last trains had left to my destination (because I missed them waiting for my newly gate checked bag, I had to gate check the carry on). The person didn’t care when I said this is what I needed to avoid. I needed to pay extra for ground transportation because of this guy who wouldn’t let me remove a book from the carry-on to meet their highly restrictive carry on limit of 15 pounds. Buyer beware. A paid carry on is not the same as a paid carry on on other airlines. This is clearly a gotcha airline. Pay up. And good luck getting someone to answer emails, calls or customer service inquiries online or on the phone. Some people have positive reviews because the stars aligned for them. But you may not be as lucky. I won’t be buying Air Portugal tickets ever again.

### "They have poor customer service and their staff are arrogant"
Worst travelling experience I have ever had in my life! I have planned a vacation of 5 days in Porto. I arrived on June 26th to find out that my luggage was missing. My last 4 days was to go back and forth to Porto airport to see if they have found my luggage since you don’t get any answer from their call center service. They have poor customer service and their staff are arrogant. Today (day 4) the agent that I have talked to at the airport even told me that he couldn’t do nothing, that my tag was probably lost and that if I’m lucky I might get my luggage back at home in Canada! Very disappointed that they treat customers with so lack of respect. I wouldn’t recommend this company to anyone! My 4 day vacation was very stressful and I still haven’t found my luggage.

### "This is the worst experience I have ever had in my life"
This is the worst experience I have ever had in my life. I was supposed to fly from Naples to Lisbon to Chicago. My flight to Lisbon was so late we missed our connection. They rescheduled me for the next day from Toronto to Chicago and that flight ended up being delayed as well. I demanded to be moved to another flight to go into the US. From there my bag was not moved to the new flight and now I can't get anyone to help me get my luggage back. There is no line that works. The numbers either don't work or there is no one there. I would never  use this service again.

### "Call Center are no help either"
Not Verified | Berlin to Recife via Lisbon. This airline is a disgrace! My girlfriend is stuck in Lisbon, because her flight from Berlin was delayed. The connecting flight to Brazil left without the Berlin passengers and the TAP Portugal people gave out vouchers for food but rejected to provide accommodation for the passengers stranded and delayed by 24 hours due to no fault of their own, but the fault of the airline! This airline make hundreds of thousands every day but reject paying for accommodation at about 80€ for a night in a hotel and instead asks people to stay at the airport for 24 hours? Would they accept this kind of behavior from another airline? Would they want their daughters to be treated this way? Rude behavior by unprofessional bastards who shouldn't work in customer service as they are lacking empathy and human emotions. And the Call Center are no help either!

### "Worst customer service"
I had a misfortune of my flight to Lisbon being rebooked with last leg being on TAP - which promptly lost our luggage and then after luggage was delivered to Lisbon 2 days later refusing to give it to us because "they need to follow their protocol" - which presumably gives them 5 days to reply to our claim and after that we need to jump through several hoops to maybe get it. Worst customer service and luggage handling of any airline I ever used. However cheap their tickets are - it's not worth it if you have no luggage.

### "crew offered us no information"
Not Verified | Madrid to Toronto via Lisbon. Upon boarding the plan you immediately noticed some smoke like gas coming from the windows and the smell of gas. After over an hour of sitting in the plane, the pilot announced that there was a technical error and we would be departing soon. We were kept on the plane for 3 hours, suffering through the horrible stench of gas. Throughout this time, the crew offered us no information nor basic necessities such as water. Next we were informed that the plane was NOT going to take off and we took a bus back; upon entering the airport there was no Tap Portugal employee there to greet us or inform the over 200 passengers on what to do. After over an hour of scrambling around the airport completely lost, a random Tap employee showed us and told us to follow them to the desk where they supplied us with a dinner voucher worth 12 euros and told us to come back at 11pm. Note that on countless occasions we had asked the employees regarding our situation and they assured us that we would be put in a hotel and our bags would go directly to Toronto. After dinner, in which we had to pay for the majority ourselves given the expensive prices at the airport in which a bottle of water cost 4 euros, we returned to the booth. After the Tap employees showed up 30 minutes late, one of them had the audacity to ask the group, “Why didn't you guys come here earlier?” insinuating that it was the client’s fault that we were stuck on the plane for 3 hours. Upon rebooking our flight for the next day, they informed us that all the hotels in Lisbon were booked and that they would not be providing a hotel. Suddenly a very rude Tap employee came screaming at us, stating that we had to go collect our luggage or they would be sent to lost and found. I also noticed that if you spoke to them in Spanish or Portuguese they would give you a better answer than if you spoke to them in English. So the Tap employee took the group to the EXIT of the border security and let us in to collect our bags. It was there that I was informed that the company had LOST one of my bags and I was taken to the baggage complaint section. It was there where I encountered their boss, who by far made the stressful encounter even more stressful by shouting, degrading, and refusing to help not only to me but also a very kind older lady. Eventually, I gave up and went to return to the Tap booth only to see that ALL EMPLOYEES HAD DISAPPEARED. Given no other choice, myself and hundreds of other passengers were forced to sleep on the floor without water or a blanket. Around 5 am, we were encountered with yet another group of around 200 people who’s flight to Cancun, Mexico was cancelled claiming “technical difficulties.” After another hour of waiting it was finally my turn when the employee stated that I had to pay for my bag and the extra weight. I kept on telling him that I had already paid for my bag and that in Madrid they checked the weight and it was acceptable but the flat out refused to check them stating “I will not do it for you.

### " I will never fly TAP Portugal again"
Terrible experience with TAP Air Portugal. Our flight was canceled and there was zero communication about that! I kept checking my email and the TAP, but there were no updates. The agent printed our boarding pass when we checked our luggage, and even that showed the original departure time. We went to the gate to find a different flight and airline. We asked the passengers sitting there what was going on, and they said the flight was delayed, not sure how long, perhaps around 6 hours. Passengers were kept in the dark with no idea what was going on. Once we got in the new flight, we didn’t get the seats we had paid extra money to reserve. There are no refunds for that, so I’m out $300. The experience at the Lisbon airport was awful. Between 1,000-2,000 people in line for passport check with 4 workers checking. There were no bathrooms for us as we had to get through passport check before being allowed to use the restroom. The woman working security was incredibly rude, but I won’t go into detail with that long story. Then there was trouble finding the gate for our connecting flight. It wasn’t on the app or the pass. We had to check the scrolling departures board to find it, and they didn’t post it until less than 30 minutes prior to boarding. The airport was incredibly crowded with no where to sit and eat due to overcrowding. Also, they closed the two men’s bathrooms at the same time, leaving just one stall open, so a long line formed. I will never fly TAP Portugal again. Definitely not worth the little bit of saving to be treated badly and not get what we paid for.

### "TAP refuses to give us our money back"
Not Verified | On April 14 we were supposed to fly TAP Air from Malaga Spain to Lisbon and then on to Toronto. April 12 we completed our boarding passes for the flight and also paid a total of 320 euro for preferred seats and 2 checked bags. Late in the evening of April 13th we received an email, which we didn't see until we got up at 4 am on the 14th, to inform us that the TAP flights were cancelled and we had been routed on Air France to Paris and then Air Canada to Toronto. We had to pay the checked baggage fee again and did not get our chosen seats on AC. TAP refuses to give us our money back for what we paid for and did not receive. Lesson. Never fly TAP again and never pay for extras in advance. I can only assume that TAP took our money knowing there was not going to be a flight because it was only 36 hours between completing our boarding passes and notification of being rerouted.

### "sit in the back of the plane"
First off at the TAP ticket counter in Newark the ticket agents told us that we could not fly into Portugal due to #1 not having a covid test #2 due to our vaccinations were more than 7 months old. It clearly states on TAP web site that if you are connecting in Portugal you do not need these. We were in a panic and they were rude and unhelpful and were not going to check us in but told us we would probably be turned away. They ended up checking us in and we did not need any of those things! I had paid $238 for extra legroom seats on 4/18/22 and told TAP  it was because my daughter was in a wheelchair and needed the extra room. When we got on the plane we were forced to sit in the back of the plane.

### "Extremely unfriendly staff on the ground"
Not Verified |  Extremely unfriendly staff on the ground. The woman decided my bag was 'too big', not any bigger then the fellow travellers, so it has to be taken in the luggage compartment . After I complained nothing changed however more and more people got on with bags as big or bigger. As I am writing this I hope to find my luggage at my final destination complete and unharmed. Never again.

### "they can't even pretend to care"
Not Verified |  Bags didn't arrive, they said we would have them the next day. The next day arrives and nothing. Called them, waited on hold for half an hour, only to be told they don't know and there's nothing they can do. Still don't have the bags or any idea of if / when we will get them back. Worst of all, they can't even pretend to care.

### "We were happy with the flights"
We flew out to Lisbon on 04 June and back on the 11th. Both legs were with TAP on their Embraer 190. Outbound and worried about all the press reports of massive queues in Manchester we arrived three and a half hours early. In fact, our only wait was for thirty minutes for the check-in desks to open. Our flight left a few minutes late and onboard the 190 is a nice aircraft to fly in economy. The same happened on our return flight too. The seats on this narrow body are two and two so no stranger to sit next to us. Leg room was adequate for this two-and-a-half-hour flight. There is no IFE and no included catering, as is standard now on all European airline economy flights as they try to compete with the so-called "low cost" sector. A checked baggage allowance (23kg) was included as was an 8kg carry-on allowance. Food and beverages were available to purchase. The cabin crew were efficient and pleasant and announcements from the cockpit were pretty standard. We were happy with the flights and our first time on TAP and the 190.

### "reserved but not fully booked"
Apparently, they charged me, booked my flight, sent me a confirmation number. When I arrived at the airport my ticket never existed. They told me that I was reserved but not fully booked. Then, I had to book a flight with a new airline.

### "I had to book a different flight with another airline"
Will never book with TAP again! I booked my flight 10 days prior to departure and received the booking confirmation email only to find out when I arrived at the airport to check-in that TAP had cancelled my ticket and had given no notification to me. Apparently there was an issue with the payment, of which I was not informed of and I had assumed went through since I was emailed a booking confirmation. No help from their rude staff and they tried to sell me the same ticket for more than double the price. Long story short, I had to book a different flight with another airline which departed 8 hours later than originally planned.

### "Horrible experience from start to finish"
Horrible experience from start to finish. Crew wanted to check my hand baggage in at the gate as the flight was full, and I then watched it get thrown aggressively down a shoot and tossed into a trolley - was not warned about this and had my laptop in the bag. I complained to the staff and they were very rude, did not apologise and said it’s all good and that if anything is broken to speak to someone. Flight departed over an hour late. Crew were also not particularly helpful on board. Horrible experience and will not be flying TAP if I can avoid it!

### "TAP is a dreadful company"
TAP is a dreadful company. The last few flights that I took were always delayed. Last time I saw people that had to run from our flight to the connection flight, this time is me. I booked a flight from Porto-Lisbon/Lisbon-Porto and they delayed my flight more than 1 hour so meaning I'll lose my second flight. Since I never disembarked quickly with TAP, I have no confidence that I will make the second flight back home, plus the next flight will be the next day (meaning I'll lose a day at work). If you want to have a nice/peaceful journey, consider a cheaper airline than TAP.

### "The airline messed up our travel completely"
Not Verified |  We had a very bad experience. The airline messed up our travel completely. The flights were delayed hence we missed connecting flights. They made us wait standing for 3 hours in a queue at Lisbon. We had booked flights from Paris to Los Angeles. But due to a delay first at Paris and then at Lisbon, we missed our Los Angeles flight. Originally the connecting flight was from New York. They put us on a Miami flight. We had to manage our flight from Miami to Los Angeles on our own by getting stand by on American Airlines flight. Their customer service is not only horrible but non-existent.

### "not even worth traveling for free"
Not Verified | Munich to Lisbon. Service does not exist (not even emergency instructions are given before take-off). Also not even water offered, if you don't actively harass the "service"-crew. This Airline is a joke, Ryanair is luxury in comparison. 0/10 for everything, not even worth traveling for free.

### "way below standards you expect"
Just horrible. Quality and comfort below cheap airlines for price of standard carrier. Managing flight reservation online doesn’t work in most cases, you can’t choose your seat (but that’s a feature, it is possible for a price), registered baggage is an extra commodity. Staff onboard was neither polite, nor helpful. All in all, I flew with other Star Alliance members for half the TAP’s price and the overall experience was far better. Next time I’ll choose cheap flight and I won’t see any difference but price. And to clarify, nothing happened that insulted me personally, it was objectively a flight way below standards you expect from that kind of airline.

### "Poor service and crew"
Not Verified | Toronto to Casablanca via Lisbon. I will never recommend TAP Portugal airline. Poor service and crew. bad airplane. I used this airline to go for vacation, was very bad and worse when going back to my country when I provided all the COVID documents and was not allowed to board even just a transit in Portugal no reason!! No refund!! No voucher!! They refuse to refund or give a voucher after waiting like 6 months analyzing my case/complaint. Very bad experience. I lost $2,500 in this trip for me and my family plus I spent 48 hours to get an alternative airline. My kid is 7 years old and was a real pain for him!

### "not showing our vaccinations correctly"
Not Verified |  We were denied entry to our flight due to the NHS app not showing our vaccinations correctly. We were not permitted to board despite having a full course of vaccinations. We were not permitted to leave quickly and get a test to prove we were fit to fly. Staff were rude and dismissive when we tried to find out what we could do to remedy the situation. The only help we got from anyone at the gate were Gatwick employees not employed by TAP. TAP cancelled our flight. To add insult to injury, our Return flight was also cancelled not just our Outbound. Rather than splitting our booking for us, they insisted on cancelling both flights. They have essentially taken our money for a service that was not provided and without our consent removed us from the Return flight. We could have got another Outbound flight at half the price and used our original booking to Return home. We have now spend £400 on new flights. Customer service was useless, wouldn't change a thing for us, wouldn't split the booking or even partially refund our initial Return flight.

### "lack of empathy and poor service by the crew"
LHR-LIS early morning flight. Aircraft was clean and flight departed and arrived ahead of schedule. What annoyed me was the lack of empathy and poor service by the crew. Very basic announcements and one cabin crew was walking through the cabin telling everyone in a snappy and rude way to keep their face masks on and having their phones on airplane mode before takeoff. They did their job but a bit of more friendliness wouldn’t hurt them since paying customers contribute to their wages. I don’t mind paying for food or drinks as this is the new standard on most European carriers, but calling a small glass of lukewarm water and some basic soluble coffee powder a “coffee” is a joke! Even low cost carriers do better. Also, half of the options on the menu were unavailable and the “card only” payment options very limited. Service started over an hour after departure and the crew seemed to rush through it so they could get back to their galleys and chat to each other. This experience wouldn’t put me off of flying with them in the future as my flight was relatively cheap and convenient but I hope their crew would become friendlier again and take pride in their job. I also hope that short and medium haul service would improve in the future again and since they have a buy on board menu, they should at least have differentiated offers and make payment options easier. I would have gotten better coffee and food options onboard any major European low cost carrier!

### "experience has been nothing short of horrid"
Our experience with this airline has been nothing short of horrid. They canceled our connecting flight to Venice, causing us to miss a cruise we have paid $1000's of dollars for. No notification (though they claim they sent an email - we have absolutely no email from them) and no apologies or offers to refund our $1000's of dollars in flights or compensation. No offer to put us up in a hotel so we can figure out what to do next. We are currently stuck in Portugal and are going to be required to again purchase another plane ticket for over $1000 because no refund/fix was offered to us. Additionally, we paid extra money to receive Premium Economy & it was clearly stated that we would not have to pay to check our bag because of that. Imagine our dismay when we show up to the airport & are told we must pay $250 to check our bags. We explained we paid extra for Premium Economy and were able to show where it says that checking our bag would be no change, however, we were still required to pay $250 and will also have to pay another $250 on our way home. On top of that, they tried to make us pay to check our bags again for our connecting flight prior to it being canceled. I put my foot down at that point & refused and thankfully they eventually relented & decided to not charge us. No one told us this flight was canceled when we checked the bags, so now our bags are likely headed to Italy, which we are not now, so that will be another mess for US to figure out because the customer service has been of no help. Literally, at all. The customer service is not friendly and seem rather annoyed to be doing their job. I do understand that an airport job is likely not enjoyable, you deal with frustrated people every day, but if that is not something you can do while providing good customer service to people are are being wronged and have every right to be frustrated, you shouldn't be working that job. If all of that is not enough, the one night stay at our hotel that we had here in Portugal (we had to stay one night here because our connecting flight was supposed to be the next day) was also somehow canceled before we showed up so we had to re-book and re-pay for that. With no refund, of course. Do not book with this airline! They seem cheap, however, from reading my review, you can see this trip has cost us much much more than it originally was supposed to. Should have just booked with American Airlines & paid more money - we would not be in this situation if we had. I know times are tough, TAP Portugal, but ripping people off & running a scheme to make more money off of your customers is probably why your rating is what it is. Wish we had thought more about that before we booked with you.

### "Beyond frustrated with this experience
We upgraded to Business Class on the way to Lisbon and had a very pleasant experience. However, any satisfaction that we may have had with TAP quickly evaporated upon our return trip. Upon check in we were told we needed to pay for baggage, as our tickets did not include checked luggage. I attempted to show the agent my ticket on my phone indicating that the tickets included 1 x 23 KG checked bag per passenger and was rudely informed to put my phone away, she was not interested in looking at that. I asked for a manager and was told to go to the Customer Service kiosk. After waiting 45 minutes to be seen there, a similarly rude individual told me that the system showed that our tickets did not include baggage. Once again, attempts to show them my tickets and baggage allowance on my phone were declined and I was told that the system was the correct source for baggage information, regardless of what my ticket showed. I asked if the agent did not have the ability to overwrite the charge, given the proof I had, and was told no, the system could not do overwrites as it was always correct. I asked for another manager and was told to submit a complaint when we returned home. And to make matters worse, the actual charge for the baggage was 95 Euros per bag for the fee plus a 95 Euro penalty for not paying for baggage in advance, even though our tickets clearly indicated that a 23 KG bag per person was included. I completed the Complaint form when I returned requesting a reimbursement and have heard nothing. I emailed the VP of Customer Service for TAP one week ago and once again, have heard nothing. Beyond frustrated with this experience!

### "will never use again"
Not Verified | Lisbon to Madrid. Worst service, will never use again. I had been waiting at the airport for about 8 hours because of the transfer, but I missed the flight because the information displayed on the bulletin board was incorrect. It was a mistake of the airport company, but they didn't admit it. I had to get another ticket myself without any compensation.

### "poorly informed, rudest staff"
Not Verified |  My fiancé and I booked travel from Chicago to Paris with a layover in Lisbon and then a return from Rome to Chicago layover in Lisbon again. They are unforgiving. You better show up your most perfect, put together, fully informed, self when you fly TAP. They will not be on your side for anything. It starts with the phone calls before travel, the simplest question, to the boarding of the flight, to the service inside the plane, you will feel as if YOU are the enemy and somehow the entire staff is against you and unwilling to help you reach your ultimate goal which is simply getting from point A. to point B which is the service we pay them to provide. I would describe the TAP prices to be similar to that of Spirit “barely there fare” Some of the other customers reviewing this airline had horrifying customer service experiences that made me truly believe I got off lucky in my travels. This is the most disorganized, poorly informed, rudest staff, no communication having airline in existence.

### "my first and last trip with this company"
Traveling with TAP Portugal is a nightmare. I bought a return ticket, entitled to 2 free bags/suitcases, each 23kg. To my surprise, the 2nd suitcase was no longer free when returning to Canada and I only learned that at the airport, I had to pay more than $200 to TAP Portugal. When I arrived home, TAP Portugal 1 800 phone does not handle my type of claim (expenses for the 2nd suitcase), the customer service rep provided me a phone number to call in Lisbon, at my expense. In Lisbon, the customer service rep was rude and couldn't let me finish a sentence without interrupting. Tap Portugal has been the most vicious and deceptive experience ever. This is my first and last trip with this company.

### "The food was to say the least disgusting"
I bought our tickets direct from TAP's website. The flight form Istanbul to Lisbon (TP6455) operated by Turkish Airlines. The flight from Istanbul was delayed by 1 hour and we ended up missing our connecting flight to Rio de Janeiro. I was told to go to TAP customer services which involved going through immigration to the departure area. After finding the customer services and explaining our problem I was told to take a ticket with a number and wait they will call me. My ticket number was 108 and the current number they were interviewing was 75. After waiting 4 hours I realised we will still be there till after midnight and the next flight was at 23h30. So I went to one of the ladies in their office and explained that we have been waiting 4 hours and we will miss the next flight if they do not assist us. This woman informed me that it is not a TAP problem I will have to go to Turkish Airlines and they must sort out the problem. I informed this woman that I bought these tickets from TAP and not TK and that the ticket constitutes a contract between me and TAP. But she said it not their problem and closed the door. Turkish Airlines were very professional and assisted us. They even personally ensured that our luggage got onto the Rio flight. The food on the Lisbon to Rio flight was to say the least disgusting. We has a choice between meat balls or pasta. I ordered the pasta and when I tried to get one of the ravioli on my fork the whole meal lifted off the dish. They were all stuck together with no sauce, bone dry pasta. Breakfast the following morning was a thick brown bread cheese sandwich and cold coffee. This airline should have a notice as you board saying 'Sorry our food is to disgusting to eat so we have decided not be provide a meal service'.

### "their customer service is horrific"
My wife and daughter tested positive for COVID the day before our flight back to the US. I called TAP Portugal to verify their COVID policy and get assistance for changing our flight. This should have been a straightforward experience but instead the airline agent couldn't provide us the policy and kept transferring us to a "change agent" to process the ticket change. We also received different theories about their covid flight policy. I was also never able to speak withe change agent. Every time I was transferred I was put on hold for 1 1/2 to 2 hours and then disconnected. This happened three times on the day of the positive covid test result and twice the day to myself and when my wife called. As a result, I changed the flight myself online to a date I thought we may be able to fly based on the CDC policy. We were also charged money for changing the flight even though some agents said this wouldn't occur. We retrieved recovery paperwork from the local health agency and tried to fly based on 10 day being passed the start of our symptoms. However, we were denied boarding at the gate because the TAP agent said we couldn't board until 10 days past the date of the positive test. We had to spend hours going through customs, retrieving our bags and then waiting to met with a customer service agent to change our flight. The customer service agent was not 100% sure of the covid policy but at least she didn't charge us additional money to change the flight again. We we're able to fly out on the new date but I called United Airlines to check their covid policy in case we were denied boarding again by TAP. I was able to get through to an agent tin 5 minutes who clearly told me their policy. This entire situation could have been avoided if TAP Portugal knew their own policy and provided customer service that actually tried to assist the customer. United Airlines isn't perfect and are more expensive to fly but I will definitely fly them my next trip to Portugal. Its unfortunate because the actually flight experience with TAP is fine but their customer service is horrific.

### "reminded me more of EasyJet"
Not Verified |  ZRH-LIS and back on the way to the Azores. Fares very competitive, flight experience is what you have paid for: clean but sterile interior, legroom poor, seats do not recline, no screens, a cup of water is all you get. Meals and drinks are sold, both ways at a 30% discount (seems to be standard announcement to motivate passengers consuming), no cash payment accepted. It reminded me more of EasyJet than a Star Alliance carrier. However, the flights were on time and hassle free. Thus: for the flights only I would have given them 5/10. The real pain starts with their website. For hours I tried to book the flights online and every time after inserting all passenger information (for 4 people), seat choice etc., when it came to payment, the website said that an error had occurred and that I should start the booking process again. The funny thing: after the second and third time, the price for the flight went up. Changed browser, accepted all cookies, but no way to finish the booking. The same day I tried again in the evening - same thing happened - booking processes interrupted, prices going up. The day after tried again in vain, then used their calling number. If you want to book a flight, you get through quickly, for any other issues, you wait and wait. Thus booked by call center at a price around 240 Euros higher than the day before. Back on the website to insert the seat reservation myself, the original low price was shown on the screen. After sending them a written complaint with screenshots, got a mail back a week after, just telling me to use their calling number with a certain code. Was connected to the wrong place (again after waiting endlessly), but the lady could at least inform me that booking via call center is charged with an extra administration fee. Nobody had told me this - I would first have tried to book from a different computer or waited a few days, if I had known. Also the seat reservations changed or even disappeared over time thus had to adjust them just before the check in. Thus - for a simple direct flight to Portugal I would probably chose them again, if the price was really low, but not for any more complicated flight connection. The risk of getting stuck at their call centre or having to deal with their website is too big.

### "it was a very positive experience"
I flew TAP from IAD-LIS and back from AGP-LIS-IAD, and overall it was a very positive experience. The price was very reasonable for a transatlantic trip, and the ability to add a stopover in Portugal without having to pay much extra allowed me to have a nice addition to my vacation to Spain. I paid for extra legroom seats on the oceanic sectors, which were very comfortable. The food provided on the oceanic sectors was good - they served it with real silverware, which is something I've never seen a US airline do in Economy. Also, even on the 75 minute AGP-LIS sector they offered free coffee and tea - something which most US airlines don't do for that short a flight and most European airlines charge for, and I really appreciated both that they did it at all and that it was free. The service on the ground could be improved - when I needed to change my flight it proved impossible to do online, and it took a month to get through to someone at the phone center. Also, they only had a couple people at the check in desks at AGP, so I had a 45 minute wait to check my bag. However, overall I was very pleased with TAP, and recommend them as a good option from the US to southern Europe.

### "One of the worst customer interaction / relation"
Arrived at Dublin airport at 4:00am for a Flight to Lisbon at 05:35am and then to Brazil. Passport got lost / stolen after security scan check. I realize this sitting at the gate door 217 in departure to Lisbon, thus, running all the way back to see if the passport didn't slip out of my pocket, go back to the security explaining the situation, to the Airport police as well (they check everywhere, try to help as much as they can), fill up an online form to the lost&found at Dublin airport (got proof / email confirmation of my request). Do everything I can to get my passport back. The flight goes out without me obviously as I cannot board without a passport. Then, went back and looking every corner of the airport, asking to every official I met, until one claims they "found a passport", passport was sitting here on a desk, no one caring about it that someone in an Airport could actually need it, passport sitting here for maybe hours? No speaker announcement, passport not brought to the gate, nothing done, basically alone trying to fix this, I get it back, run to the Gate (flight was gone) then they tell me to re-schedule it with their desk area 14, going there, waiting one hour an a half, they tell me "wrong place", you need to go somewhere else, going there, waiting for you to tell them, we cannot do anything need to call TAP, then you call TAP they tell you to go back to the desk. After few calls with their support (total disaster) leading to nothing, even hanging up on you. My partner tried to call them as well (hanging up on her while waiting a transfer, 1h53 on a call with them) They claim that I'm a "no-show" and  took the liberty of cancelling my flights and even the return one in 2 weeks, I'm willing to pay 1000 euros to buy a new way-in/outbound flight, but they don't want to hear, they cancel ALL my flights and want me to re-pay a new one (2000 euros). Claiming that I'm a no-show while every official of the airport / scan security check and camera can attest I was here, sitting, waiting for my flight. Now, their support drive me around, try to smother this and dodge as much as they can. Lost 2 weeks of holidays booked for months and truly deserved, lost 1000 euros, lost the 89th bday of my partner's grandpa, huge moral prejudice and their support is all but not helping and trying to understand. One of the worst customer interaction / relation I've ever had.

### "Really shabby onboard service"
Flight departed and arrived on time. Service for business class basic at the most. No choice of meal. Served as quickly as possible. No interaction with customers apart from what you want to drink with your meal. No sooner than finished tray taken. Look of horror on staffs face because I asked for tea. Only set up for coffee. No milk only powder. Really shabby onboard service. Will not fly with TAP again. Passengers seemed an annoyance rather than understanding we pay their wages.

### "refund policy is only understood by them"
Not Verified |  Good onboarding and staff on ground. Overall a decent flight experience and one of the more inexpensive ones to fly. Their change of flights and refund policy is only understood by them. They change flights and do not refund entire amounts - call centre never contactable. Would I fly them again - only if the difference between BA and them is not significant.

### "Boarding a little confused"
Venice to Lisbon. Check in was OK, As a Star Alliance Gold I have the right to take 1 extra luggage. Boarding a little confused, no priority to board, only 1 line. Meal was OK. Flight also OK, no turbulence, arrived on time. All in all an OK flight. Would fly again, ONLY because it is the only airline with non stop flight from Venice to Lisbon.

### "an OK flight"
Lisbon to Paris. Check in was OK, TAP has a premium zone for check in at Lisbon Airport, on the ground floor. As a Star Alliance Gold I have the right to take 1 extra luggage. Boarding a little confused, no priority to board, only 1 line. Meal was OK. Flight also OK, no turbulence, arrived on time. All in all an OK flight. Would fly again , ONLY because it is the only airline with flight from Lisbon to Paris Orly

### "yet to receive the correct refund"
I booked a flight from the USA to France In August of 2021. I had a connecting flight on each leg of the trip. One week before my September flight, the first flight of my return journey home was changed, which would not allow me to make my connecting flight at all. I did not confirm this new flight, and in the email I received with this information, TAP writes: "If you have a cancellation, significant delay, or misconnection, according to article 8 of Community Regulation (EC) 261/2004, you will have the right to choose between: A refund for the part or parts of the journey not made, and for the part or parts already made if the flight is no longer serving any purpose in relation to the passenger's original travel plan. This refund can be made to the original form of payment or by travel voucher. Re-routing, under comparable transport conditions, to their final destination. Every day before my flight, I tried calling all the phone numbers for TAP I could find, sent countless emails, and filled out complaint and refund forms on their website. I was never able to get through to anyone and never received a response. I tried talking to every TAP agent at the airport and they all told me to call the customer support number and would hand me a business card without the customer support number written on it. While I was in France, I did the same thing every day, still not able to get through to anyone, nor receiving any form of response or communication. I eventually had to purchase another flight home (on a different airline, out of a different city). I returned back to America in October 2021, and ever since then (it is now April 2022, a whole seven months after my flight was canceled), I have still yet to receive the correct refund for the return leg of the trip. I have called multiple times and am told the same thing every time "I will file a follow-up and mark it with priority. Most recently, I was told that their policy has changed and they no longer issue refunds to the original form of payment (even though in the fine print of my canceled flight, TAP writes that I have the option to have the amount refunded to the original form of payment), they now need bank information to issue the refund. I told them I was not going to provide my secure bank information to them, as they have made it clear that I can be refunded to my original form of payment, which is the safer way to do that. TAP Air Portugal knows what they're doing and is doing everything they can to not issue refunds, even when they have themselves stated my right to a refund.

### "flight was full and there were only three counters open"
TAP service assessment at check-in for flight TP1688 from Funchal to Lisbon, as soon as we arrived at the airport and went to the check-in counters (I would point out that we had already done it online, we only went there to dispatch our luggage), the queue was interminable. The flight was full and there were only three counters open, one for the only person traveling on Business. My 83-year-old mother was on her feet for the time it took to get to our turn, I complained that there was no TAP employee to provide information, assistance, or pass people with disabilities ahead. Nobody answered me. Is this the service that TAP intends to institute by laying off employees? Is this the service on the island of Madeira, a major tourist attraction in Portugal? Is it because they were mostly Portuguese that we had second-class treatment?

### "worst airline I have ever flown"
Do not fly TAP Portugal, avoid at all costs. It is the worst airline I have ever flown on in the last 30 years. Terrible customer service. Horrible, unusable website. No communication. Cancelled our return flight and cost us dear to get home. The mission of the airline appears to be to ruin tourism to Portugal.

### "Absolutely horrible service"
Lisbon to Toronto. Absolutely horrible service! My mom is 70years old and on insulin and sometimes has sugar withdrawal. We had to check in our carry on and had no access to anything with sugar. The flight attendant didn’t come when the button was pressed for 15min then she walked in to ask for some sager and she was told “the meal will be served in a few min”; she said thank you and sat down. Then as she was about to faint I went in to ask for some sager and the flight attendant yelled and says, “I said the food is being served soon” and I said I need a sugar pack asap; he literally pull out a drawer full of all kind of Sweet and throws me a sugar pack.

### "sent me off to take the 2-hour PCR test"
Dreadful airline. Transferring in Lisbon, I was denied from boarding the flight to Miami due to my PCR test having been taken over 24 hours ago (but fewer than 48 hours). It didn't matter that I'm a US citizen returning to the USA, having a vaccination card with 2 doses and a booster, they sent me off to take the 2-hour PCR test. The gate staff gave me wrong directions to the COVID testing desk, which I finally found after 30 minutes of walking around all throughout the secure area, just to discover that there is actually no 2-hour PCR test. The gate agent had lied to me to get me to leave the gate, and now it was too late to get on that flight. What followed was endless queues to exit the airport's secure area (~2 hours wait), to speak to a useless customer service representative (~1.5 hours wait) who told me they will not refund any part of the flight or even help me reschedule it, to take another PCR test (~1 hour wait). During check-in at Frankfurt, nobody from the airline staff cared to mention to me the new 24-hour PCR test requirement, so I had no idea that a terrible surprise awaited in Lisbon. I spent the night sleeping across some hard plastic seats in the airport. I had to buy a new ticket at full price, paid $110 for a small checked bag, and $100 for the PCR test. Outrageous prices, useless customer service, endless queues, and employees who simply don't care. Trust TAP Air Portugal to turn a seemingly mundane itinerary into a nightmare.

### "Very bad experience with TAP"
Not Verified |  Very bad experience with TAP. Our flight via Lisbon was delayed due to fog at Lisbon. Ground crew at Lisbon were almost non-existent and provided no assistance to ensure we reached Faro in a reasonable amount of time (they proposed laying on a coach to arrive at the airport at 3am!). Crew on the flight were apologetic but couldn’t help. Drinks and meal service was very poor - I don’t expect asparagus for breakfast! Lounge was overly busy and food and drinks selection was equally poor. Flight back from Portugal to UK was just as bad - no lounge or fast-track security provided at Faro; bag drop only open two hours before departure. Flight late. Business class flights for this time of year were cheap but the cost in stress was more than the saving. There were no redeeming features of this trip and I cannot recommend TAP to any traveller.

### "a very bad experience with TAP"
Really a very bad experience with TAP, as they managed to cancel my flight and delay my 2 suitcases for more than 48 hours. It all started on April 9 when I had a flight from Rome to Lisbon with TAP. A few hours ago I was informed that the flight was canceled (TP 843) without a reason and I was scheduled for flight TP 837 to Lisbon the next day. Also from a simple internet search I found that TP843 on Sundays is often canceled. Arriving in Lisbon, however, the surprise was even greater when I found that my luggage had been lost. I reported the incident to Handling company, Groundforce, in order an amount for basic necessities to be approved, as they did not know where my luggage was or when it would arrive. Groundforce referred me to TAP Customer Service Offices at Lisbon Airport. The queue was really outrageous. I waited 8 hours when I decided to leave with at least 50 passengers in front of me with similar requests. No one from the company was interested in so many people. No customer-centric approach. No sensitivity for the customer who trusted (wrongly) this company. No organization, no empathy. I believed that the company's telephone service would be better. Unfortunately 45 minutes of waiting and no one answered. Also, no one has answered the tickets through the complaints system until today, 1 week later. My request was simple: I was seeking compensation for the cancellation of the flight and the satisfaction of my expenses for basic items until my luggage appeared. It is a shame that this company is still operating. This image is a shame. One should resign from the executives. The image of the complaints office at Lisbon airport shows their mentality, huge queue even now. Shame on them! Avoid flying with this company. Even Low cost airlines are closer to the customer!

### "the worst customer service possible"
Hands down, the worst customer service possible. Flight arrived late in Lisbon to make the connection to Washington. They had two agents for about 200 people. Waited in line for 3 1/2 hours to re-book, only to find they could not get us to our destination for three days. They suggested we fly the next day to Newark instead, and then buy tickets down to IAD on another airline and submit a reimbursement request with TAP. We sent in the $1300 refund request on Jan 7, for 3 passengers. Today, April 12, they emailed back our refund in the form of a $200 voucher for travel with TAP! It's absolute thievery, besides being incompetent. There is no email to respond to. just their interminable web site "customer service". Incidentally, on the outbound flight they also lost the luggage for 6 days, and any call to TAP required at least a 45 minute wait-time to reach anyone. The bottom line is that if you ever need to reach customer service you will bitterly regret the day you decided to fly with them. No rate is attractive enough to make travel with TAP worthwhile.

### "customer service is unprofessional"
TAP Portugal's customer service is unprofessional, inappropriate and kind of abusive towards clients. Trying to resolve a fairly typical issue of frequent air travellers who have connecting flights. I spent hours on the phone talking to a dozen of the airline representatives, each of whom provided me with controversial and inconsistent information but failed to help. In addition, the line was continuously disconnected in the middle of a conversation, so I had to call back many times, waiting in a long queue and explaining the nature of my request to different agents. None of them put me in touch with a manager or supervisor at my request, and their helpless chatter had nothing to do with the customer service support required by international airline standards.

### "They have the worst customer service"
Not Verified |  On the way from Amsterdam to Lisbon to flight got canceled. I couldnt get any other flight and had to wait till the next day. They have the worst customer service. From Lisbon to Amsterdam: i arrived at 16.00 at the airport, flight was supposed to leave at 18.00. I got delayed till 20.20 so i was waiting there till 19.30 and then saw the message the flight got canceled entirely. I will never ever in my life book a flight with this airline.

### "service provided was less than average"
Lisbon to Cancun. To begin with, the price of an executive ticket is not cheap, but the executive service seems to be. Shame on a Star Alliance airline, without a welcome drink: not even a water, at least. Afterwards, the crew seems to be doing us a favor by doing the in-flight service. It is incredible that people with a lot of experience and some age, who should be professionals and set an example for the younger ones, are the opposite, who literally threw the tray to the top of the table, without the slightest care and without a word of sympathy, like please and thank you. They didn't even deign, during the flight, to stop by the cabin to see if the passengers needed anything, or if everything was fine. All orders must be made by calling the crew, or by directing me to the galley. As for the meal, it was unfortunate, because it was the same meal as a mid-course meal, and that doesn't seem normal for a 10:30 flight. The shameful starter, the main course a meat with a carrot puree, in which the carrot puree tasted like mold. I still questioned and complained to the flight attendant, but his reaction was to literally ignore my complaint, without an apology, or he could have had the attitude of apologizing and that he would see if there was any hot meal left to replace mine. The dessert, a ridiculous dimension. For a ticket of 2227 euros, the service provided was less than average, taking into account the flights carried out in other companies in business class, such as a Qatar, a Swiss or even a Lufthansa. A suggestion: send Tap crew members to one of these long-haul, executive companies, so that they can learn what a 5-star service provided to passengers is, with friendliness and professionalism. | Para começar, o preço da passagem executiva não é barato, mas o serviço executivo parece ser. Vergonha para uma companhia aérea da Star Alliance, sem uma bebida de boas-vindas: nem mesmo uma água, pelo menos. Quando um Lufthansa ou suíço, eles oferecem champanhe, água e sucos. Depois, a tripulação parece estar nos fazendo um favor ao fazer o serviço de bordo. É incrível que pessoas com muita experiência e alguma idade, que deveriam ser profissionais e dar o exemplo para os mais novos, sejam o contrário, que literalmente jogaram a bandeja em cima da mesa, sem o menor cuidado e sem palavra de simpatia, como por favor e obrigado. Nem se dignaram, durante o voo, a passar na cabine para ver se os passageiros precisavam de alguma coisa, ou se estava tudo bem. Todas as ordens devem ser feitas ligando para a tripulação ou me direcionando para a cozinha. Quanto à refeição, foi lamentável, porque era a mesma refeição que uma refeição a meio do curso, e isso não parece normal para um voo das 10:30. A entrada vergonhosa, o prato principal uma carne com purê de cenoura, em que o purê de cenoura tinha gosto de mofo. Ainda questionei e reclamei com a aeromoça, mas a reação dele foi literalmente ignorar minha reclamação, sem pedir desculpas, ou poderia ter tido a atitude de se desculpar e que veria se sobrava alguma refeição quente para substituir a minha. A sobremesa, uma dimensão ridícula. Para um bilhete de 2227 euros, o serviço prestado foi inferior à média, tendo em conta os voos realizados em outras companhias em classe executiva, como a Qatar, a Swiss ou mesmo a Lufthansa. Uma sugestão: envie os tripulantes da Tap a uma destas empresas executivas de longo curso, para que conheçam o que é um serviço de 5 estrelas prestado aos passageiros, com simpatia e profissionalismo.

### "dishonest and unorganized"
Not Verified |  I had a ticket in June 2020 to round trip from Washington Dulles to Lisbon that was cancelled due to COVID. TAP Portugal refused to refund the $1000 which I understand since they and every other airline would probably have gone bankrupt. They promised a voucher good for one year from issuance which I tried to obtain in January 2022 for a trip in May 2022. After at least 8 calls and interminable hold times they lied to me each and every time about their voucher which they told me was on the way but it turns out no one at TAP Portugal ever applied for one. So basically they stole the $1000. They are dishonest and unorganized.

### "first and last time flying with TAP"
Started with delay of 3.5 hrs. Landed in Lisbon far away from terminal. Had to make an bus ride of more then 10 minutes to get to the terminal. Missed connection flight to Amsterdam with departure time 09.05. Became new ticket for flight at 18.20. Waiting time at airport more than 9 hrs. In the terminal looked at TAP side and saw there was a flight departing 14.40. Could book that flight, there were plenty empty seats in the plane. When we started there was a problem with one engine. Was repaired and started with another delay of 1.5 hrs. This was the first and last time flying with TAP.

### "staff seemed condescending"
Flight was delayed therefore I had to wait for a whole day to get to my destination, I was full of anxiety not knowing if I’d get back home, it was the worst experience ever, my first time traveling and because of all that went down I don’t think I ever want to travel internationally again. The staff seemed condescending and would get annoyed if we asked questions, it’s like they looked down upon us. Everything was unnecessarily expensive.

### "you get what you pay for"
Not Verified |  We flew from LHR to LIS and there was no problem with this flight, it was on arrival in LIS that problems started. The Business Class lounge is after security but before passport control so if you want to use the lounge when in transit it means a double trip through control. The lounge itself was probably the worst I have come across. Very crowded with poor food selection and very old toilets. The gate was quite chaotic with economy class passengers having their carry on bags rejected. Why not check them at check in? It was a very crowded bus out to the aircraft and yet they were very keen on ensuring masks were kept on at all times, including on the flight. How about putting on an extra bus and ensuring social distancing? We departed on time, 10.05 and at 11.45 they served the main meal, a choice of fish, meat or pasta. My wife's fish was OK but my beef was way overdone and inedible. The front toilet was blocked off for crew use only and when the meal was cleared away by 12:30 the crew went around closing the window blinds and putting the cabin into darkness. The crew then disappeared down the back of the plane leaving 1 crew member to man several galleys. Was this flight for the benefit of the passengers to travel to Miami, or the benefit of the crew for a jolly in Miami. Yes, TAP are cheaper than other airlines but it does show and, as they say, you get what you pay for. On the upside I found the seat and entertainment to be as good as more mainline airlines, just a pity about the food and the crew/service

### "Never again with TAP"
Absolutely terrible. I was shocked when I saw they had a scale hidden behind the counter at the gate. They were trapping people after they passed through the gate, and telling basically everyone that they would have to check their luggage (perfectly normal cabin size luggage). Even more surprised, instead of offering to check these bags free of charge, as most airlines do when the flight is full, they were charging over 80£ for it. Insane. It got worse. The trip was basically what you get from a low cost airline. No food is provided. Seat space is minimal, seats are not reclinable. And then they try to force you to buy their uber-expensive food and drinks. Last thing: Be careful with the covid documents. Even though the countries are no longer requiring tests if you're vaccinated, this airline forces you do to present a test. They don't give any official reason, since the government doesn't require this, but they do. Guess what? They have a test centre ready nearby, if you pay another 100... Never again with TAP.

### "$150 if your bag is overweight"
Never fly with this airline, most horrible experience of my life. They do really sneaky things to hike up the price. Never weighed any of our carry ons on any other flights with them, then for the last flight they are standing at the boarding gate with a scale and a card reader and charging $150 if your bag is overweight. At least give people the opportunity to rearrange their bags or figure something out instead of ambushing people at the gate. The staff were horrible and mean about it and very condescending, I was stood there crying because I was on a tight budget and had to pay an unexpected cost and they were still mean. $150 if your bag is overweight. The customer service is awful they are purposely vague and trap you. Will never fly with them again, not worth the cost especially when these sneaky ads on equate to the same price as a a ticket on a better airline.

### "condescending attitude of each staff member"
Worst service ever. During my holidays in Mexico, I sustained an injury to my legs which prevented me from walking any distance or bending my legs. This made climbing up and down stairs impossible. I notified Tap Portugal of my need of assistance more than 48hours before my flight as was requested by the airline. Unfortunately, upon arrival at the airport, no assistance was provided to me at all. I was lucky to have a friend travelling with me on the first part of the journey. No wheelchair was provided by the airline and we had to take one from the airport which was not allowed past security (we had to explain this to security and almost force our way in, so as not to be sent back to the airline check in desk!). Still no assistance at the gate or on the bus to the airplane. The pinnacle was reached in front of the airplane, when they advised me that there would be no assistance to transport me up to the airplane. The airline should usually provide a specific lift for disabled people, and none was organised. To top this off, there was torrential rain outside, and all staff at Tap Portugal watched as a kind gentleman accepted to carry me on his back up the slippery wet stairs. One should be ashamed to be working for a company with such non-existent service. Arrived at Lisbon, I insisted on not leaving my seat until assistance came, which eventually arrived. Wrong wheelchair again however. We had to place my backpack and handbag on the chair footstep to help raise my legs,  again appalling service. I am not even going to speak about the condescending attitude of each staff member in the plane and on the ground. It felt humiliating from start to end. Second flight from Lisbon to Geneva and Tap had not organised any particular seating arrangement so I could stretch my legs. I ended up crying in front of the whole airplane for flight attendants to ask people to move their seats in order to free up extra leg room. At my arrival in Geneva, Tap Portugal staff had the audacity to tell me they hoped I would fly Tap again. Save your money, your time and stress, do not fly with this airline.

### "still trying to get my almost $1,000 refund"
Not Verified |  My experience with this airline has been a tragedy that has probably taken years off my life and I am shaking even as I type this. I purchased a flight before COVID and the trip was cancelled due to the pandemic. I am still trying to get my almost $1,000 refund for that flight. I am a nursing student on a limited budget and these people should be in jail for how they treat their customers. When I call, I am placed on hold for a good 2 hours, speak with someone that half the time is totally rude (even when they hear me cry on the other end), and nothing gets resolved. I am so upset that I feel like all I can do is write these reviews to warn other people never to use this airline.

### "worse service I have ever had"
I booked the ticket for the next month and got it with incorrect gender. I wrote 4 complaints that was closed successfully but no action was taken. The worse service I have ever had. I am considering to cancel the ticket because I do not discover at the last moment that I could not fly because of mistake.

### "the worst customer service"
Not Verified |  My review is about TAP customer service and how terrible they are with informing costumers and replying to emails and refunds and rebooking. Stayed on hold for more than 1-2 hours every time to be either disconnected or get wrong information. Only airline that gives you hard time with rebooking during covid. In general the worst customer service.

### "think very carefully before flying with them again"
Not Verified |  This is a Jekyll and Hyde airline. On the ground they are appalling, in the air better than ok. Because of a computer glitch our round trip booking of London Gatwick to Faro became out from Gatwick but back to Heathrow. After four hours waiting on the phone, an agent agreed to a full refund as I said I would rebook the next day (which I did). The refund would arrive within a fortnight, I was told. Now, nearly four months on, I am still awaiting 50% of the refund, despite multiple phone calls, emails to a specialist refund address and emails to the company's Vice President for Customer Service in Lisbon. The flights, recently completed, were uneventful, on schedule and in relative comfort. We have used this airline several times in the past but will think very carefully before flying with them again. I wonder if the appointment of the former boss of the now defunct Flybe as the CEO of this airline has any bearing on its dreadful management?

### "I should have taken the refund and booked Air Canada"
Not Verified |  Changing dates by one day earlier I am flying first class to Lisbon. I tried to change my seat online and was not able to do it, so I spent the last 3 days trying on the phone to get through to change the date. I was able to talk to an agent this morning after being on the phone for 1 hour and 42 minutes, then they transfer me to another agent were I was cut off after 20 more minutes. I call back this afternoon and waited another 1 hour and 45 minutes to find out it will cost me $2,000,00 more to make the change! They said because there is limited seats. I just check the web site and there is still 7 seat available right now in first class. This is the first time flying TAP and I have already started out with a bad experience. Due to COVID 19 my flight got cancelled 2 years ago, I guess I should have taken the refund and booked Air Canada.

### "95 euros because the trolley weight was 10 kg"
Be very careful with this company. The charged me 95 euros because the trolley weight was 10 kg and they have 8 kg limit. Also avoid showing your American pass if you have a European pass. It looks they check trolley weight more to foreigners more to locals.

### "worst customer service I've ever seen"
Not Verified |  I was supposed to fly Lisbon-Cancun during the pandemic but my flight got canceled. Fine, I understand that. However, what followed was beyond all expectations. My emails are ignored, my Twitter messages are ignored. This company has by far the worst customer service I've ever seen. It's been a year and 1 month exactly and I have no idea when I will see the money in my bank account. I see many people complaining on Twitter of the same issue, some have been waiting for over 2 years. This is unacceptable.

### "Do not use this company, terrible customer service"
The worst customer service, after you buy a ticket you are on your on. They don’t have desk at Malaga airport who can change your ticket. It was a desk getting people to fly to different locations, but they can’t help you with your needs of changing flights or anything else. Then they told me that the unique way to do it would be over the phone, I had already been on the phone for 12 hours before I decided to go to the airport. I was 18 hours on the phone waiting. Do not use this company, terrible customer service.

### "not consider or recommend TAP in the future"
Not Verified |  My wife and I first flew TAP last summer. Flight was late departing, missed the connecting flight, were rebooked. Return flight to Lisbon was late, bags did not arrive at the final destination. The flights were pleasant enough and we thought that perhaps the startup after Covid was rough and gave them another chance. My flight was cancelled and rebooked 2 days later, meaning a lot of bookings had to change. My wife followed me, had a 3-hour delay, missed her connecting flight, was rebooked without her knowledge, spent 2 hours in line to find this out, and is projected to arrive almost 7 hours late. We have return tickets on TAP, and little to no confidence that these arrangements in any way reflect what the reality will be. Sad to say, we will not consider or recommend TAP in the future.

### "a greedy, incompetent company"
TAP Portugal is a greedy, incompetent company. My family of four had a trip booked to Portugal for April 2020 that needed to be cancelled due to Covid. We cancelled it in January, giving them more than enough of a heads up. I recently went to to rebook our flights (rather than being refund we were told we had a credit) and I was told that we were out of the window by less than one month and therefore lost almost $3,000. Last I checked TAP, Covid is still very much a threat and  borders were recently closed due to this. I’m so disappointed with how this has been handled and cannot believe that this company is stealing from innocent people like they are especially during Covid times. We have very young children and didn’t feel safe traveling until they were able to be vaccinated. Shame on this joke of a company and their evil ways.

### "could not scan the code on his passenger locator form"
Believe the online reviews and spend your money on an airline that is willing to help their customers. My father, a US citizen, was scheduled to fly from London, connect in Lisbon, Portugal and then to California. He checked in with an agent at Heathrow 3+ hours before his flight was departing to Portugal and was told that they could not scan the code on his passenger locator form, which is currently required to enter Portugal (supposedly, the code was too small). He told them he didn't have a working phone in London and therefore could not access the form via email. At that point, they told him he would not be able to board. There was no other solution or help offered to fill out/print another form online, which takes less than 5 minutes. He lost out on an $800 ticket, and I haven't been able to get through to customer service (waiting more than an hour, only for the call to mysteriously disconnect). Please save yourself the hassle and book with an airline who has good customer service and readily accessible agents.

### "Terrible experience  both ways"
Terrible experience on both ways to and from Newark to Lisbon. The crew seemed annoyed that they have to serve food and drinks to Business Class passengers. They came once asking for drinks and that was it. I had the feeling that you had to beg for everything and be thankful that they serve you. I wasn’t the only passenger that was very unhappy with the service. On the flight to EWR I was super happy to fly the A321LR. It was unfortunately the smallest Business Class Seat I have ever sit in. I am 6’4 with broad shoulders and only could sleep on the side with my legs pulled up. On the flight back from EWR we flew in an A330 neo, the crew was seriously the worst crew I have ever experienced in a business class: they blocked the front toilet next to the cockpit, multiple people including my wife and me tried to get there as only two other toilets were available for the Business Class (which got used by the prem eco passengers as the crew didn’t feel they need to restrict them). Everybody got turned away but the crew used it, so there was not technical problem. I asked the purser why I couldn’t use this bathroom and she answered: Only for crew members! Unbelievable! Food was pretty decent, wine selection mediocre. I cannot recommend this airline to anyone

### "Very polite and attentive"
The crew did a spectacular job hosting the two passengers on business. Very polite and attentive. The food isn't fantastic but it's good enough for the duration of the flight and the service was indeed superior. Great hostesses. Captain landed safely in Madeira despite strong winds and rain that made the flight more interesting. Just please make this experience the rule TAP.

### "I’d like a refund"
Right after checking in I heard 2 close contacts tested positive for Covid. I called for 9 hours of being on hold as every hour the line would disconnect. I’d get to the first person and then they’d transfer me to the Department of Changes and I never got talk to anyone in the department. I even showed up at the airport to try to rebook there but they could not. Finally I got a response on Twitter that to change my flight I would need to pay an additional $579. My original ticket was $572. On the phone a representative had said I am eligible for the promotional no change fee, but the representative on Twitter said I would have had to change 3 days in advance. In most Covid cases, you wouldn’t know 3 days ahead. Spain does not allow entry if you have been exposed to someone with Covid in the last 7 days. I had no other option and now must pay double. Plus the representative on Twitter is now not responding. TAP Portugal, I’d like a refund, and you should hire more representatives.

### "the crew, lack empathy and particularly training in business class service"
The executive class of TAP has good legroom and the food is acceptable but is far from being worth the price. The only crew member serving on this occasion forget intentionally or unintentionally the beverages, bread, etc. so passengers ate all their food before having something to drink. Even calling them on the panel above in this class is worthless. With the initial turbulence, the cup of coffee shook so hard most of its content spilt out. The wife of the captain introduced herself to the cabin crew and sat in business class too. Other TAP professionals and family seemed to have gotten free tickets to board. In first row you can hear quite a lot. It worries me substantially as a Portuguese taxpayer with TAP being mostly a public sector company. Shameful and sadly not surprising. As for the crew, they lack empathy and particularly training in business class service, I think a regular restaurant waitress would do a far better job; they should have the younger cabin crew in this function. Try being decent for once TAP and stop shaming the name of Portugal.

### "refund, which I still haven't received"
In 2020 I bought six tickets to Lisbon. My flight was cancelled due to COVID. I chose to get a refund, which I still haven't received. It's almost two years now. They just keep saying sorry and nothing happens. I'm sure I will never fly with them.

### "I do not recommend to anyone"
Due to the covid, our flight was canceled twice. We got a voucher. Unfortunately, the Budapest-Lisbon flight was canceled in 2021, making tickets four times more expensive. I asked for a refund of the original ticket prices. They did not answer. I rushed to reply twice, and my email address was disabled! Poor company, I do not recommend to anyone!

### "they make everything super difficult"
This airline is the worst, to use some covid vouchers they make everything super difficult, you cannot use the vouchers for the internet. There are only 3 vouchers per reservation, so we had to reserve 2 occasions since we are a family of 4 people. To use the vouchers it is only by phone and we spent almost 2 weeks trying to call, they do not have people, waiting time was 4 hours every time we called when we called the employees did not know how to use or apply the vouchers and they hooked us and we had to start the process again. They do not content the emails. Their internet page is almost always down, it doesn't work, it gives errors many times, and you can't complete the booking process as much as you want. But I completed it once and it didn't even pick up the bags I put in, then I had to do it over the phone and it's extremely difficult. I do not recommend anyone to travel through it. We did it because it came out in Hopper and it was the biggest mistake. They make everything difficult to be able to travel. The page system is outdated and not to mention the cell phone application, I tried to put it on and it never syncronized with my reservation on the page. The app is difficult to use, older people could not book through the page or use the app. No supervisor ever calls us, it's wasting time and when calling their phone number the first message that comes out is that if tap portgal cancels a reservation, press 1. Apparently they cancel many reservations although it is not my case at the moment. Esta linea area es la peor, para usar unos vouchers del covid lo hacen todo super dificil, no puedes usar los vouchers para el internet. son solo 3 vouchers por reseva por tanto tuvimos que reservar 2 ocaciones ya que somos familia de 4 personas. Para usar los vouchers es solo por telefono y estuvimos casi 2 semanas tratando de llamar, no tienen personas, tiempo de espera era de 4 horas cada vez qe llamambamos cuando llamabamos los empleados no sabian usar ni aplicar los vouchers y nos enganchaban y teniamos que empezar el proceso otra vez. Ellos no contentan los emails. La paginade intenet de ellos esta casi siempre caida, no funciona, da error muchas veces, y no puedes completar el proceso de booking por mas que quieras. Pero lo complete una vez y nisiquiera me cojio las maletas que puse, luego tuve que hacerlo por telefono y es extremadamente dificil. No recomiendo a Nadie viajar por ella. Nosotros lo hicimos porque salio en Hopper y fue el error mas grade. Todo lo hacen dificil para poder viajar. El sistema de la pagina es anticuado y sin decir el de la applicacion del celular, intente ponerla y la misma nunca cincroniza con mi reserva en la pagina. El app es dificil de usar, las persona mayores no podrian ni reservar por la pagina ni usar el app. Nunca ningun supervisor nos llama, es perder el tiempo y al llamar a su numero de telefono el primer mensaje que sale es que si tap portgal les cancelo una reserva presionen el 1. Al parecer ellos cancelan muchos las resevas aunque no es mi caso al momento.

### "no booking, no reply, no outcome"
Not Verified | Tried to book online 3 months prior to travelling passport had expired but had sent off for renewal. Couldn't book as couldn’t pass the API information had to put in passport number so phoned to book flight, 1 hour waiting to get through to English speaking person. Booked a flight, got reference number, took 30 minutes with lots of reiterating name address etc. They took my credit card details, said I would receive documents within 24-48 hours. 1 week later nothing. Emailed with reference number got reply stating “to book this service contact “contact centre” ? What does that even mean? So no booking, no reply, no outcome. And where’s my credit card details I gave gone.

### "truly an awful company"
Paris to Montréal via Lisbon. Worst airline ever. Seriously, do not fly with them ever, even if the ticket seems cheap. They are getting their money another way, that involves ripping their customers off. For the specifics, I was flying from Paris to Montréal with a stop in Lisbon during the pandemic. TAP Portugal website was only displaying the information "due to covid-19 pandemics, check with the country you are flying from, by and to what the regulations are". I did, and I wasn't requested to show anything for my Paris to Portugal because I had my European sanitary pass. For Canada, I was requested to have a PCR test done 72hr before "the last country you flight from", hence, Portugal. I therefore had my test done in Paris and that would have been ready by the time I arrived in Portugal (which is what happened). Nonetheless when I tried to register in Paris airport, the TAP employee told me they will not allow me because I did not have my PCR test. Even though TAP website only indicated to comply with the countries I was traveling from, through and to, regulations, they made up a rule at the entry point, saying I had to present my test then and refuse me the boarding. They refuse to let me in the next flight even if there were seats available because I would have only 50 minutes to change plane in Lisbon. My PCR results arrived before my flight left Paris, but it was then too late to register. I had to take a plane with another airline, which cost me more than a thousand euros total and while I sent many emails to TAP following that I never got an answer. They are truly an awful company, and they will rip you off, even if you think you did everything right and did check in advance for the possibilities they could rip you off. They will find a way.

### "Staff were kind but definitely not efficient"
No vaccine proof control to access the airport in Lisbon. No vaccine proof control to access the airplane. Boarding. People pressed together for ten minutes on stairs before boarding the bus. People locked 10 minutes in bus on tarmac before getting on the plane. One of the travellers was either drunk or sick, in both cases he should have been controlled. Fortunately he was asleep for the whole flight. Passengers not wearing masks for the whole flight and cabin staff would not ask them to do so. Staff were kind but definitely not efficient. TAP says - Clean and safe - on it's communication. For sure it's not, though it might be the same for other companies. The Reservation system is hazardous: you book a flight, pay, and find out you are booked on the next flight. You are invited to check in online before the flight, but online check-in is not accessible to you (my friend could do it). Food and beverages were extra like low cost companies.

### "Premium Economy well below industry standards"
Our flight experience in Premium Economy was well below industry standards. In the Premium Economy area (rows after Business Class) we were not allowed to use the overhead bins directly above us as these were also reserved as "backup space" for business class / we were asked to put our hand luggage under the seat - on an E190 we were not allowed to use the lavatory three rows in front of us - again reserved for business - but had to go to the one rear lavatory where a queue had formed, staff showed no ability or will for flexible solutions. No complimentary meal or even water was served on a 4hrs flight LIS->RAI in Premium Economy. We bought water and ordered a lasagna, the packaging, quality and taste of the food was unsatisfactory. Bottom-line: until huge improvements in the cabin service have been made we will avoid whenever possible to fly with TAP - but if you have to fly with them on a midrange plane, we recommend not to book Premium Economy as in our experience you are way better off with a regular economy seat, you can sit closer to a usable toilet and use the overhead bins. On the expense of Premium Economy guests staff is totally trimmed to focus on the business class, there seems to be no concept for the "preferred" seating area behind business.

### "it was the worst experience"
Customer service is non-existent! Tried for two days and a total of 15 hours calling TAP Reservations center, always on hold for minimum 1 hour before someone picks up the phone, once they pick up they can never help and always have to transfer you to some other department which takes another hour before that other department picks up the phone. By the time you finally get lucky to speak to someone, they disconnect you as you’ve been on hold for too long. And you have to start all over again. I’ve tried for a total of 15 hours but never got through to them in the end. Avoid flying with Tap, especially long haul and business class, as it will be a total waste of your money. You won’t get any customer service from them and for sure will be disappointed, even if you have such a basic issue to resolve such as rebooking your flight, they won’t be able to help you. Truly, it was the worst experience.

### "back to pre-covid standards"
Business class product on European routes is back to pre-covid standards, at least on E-jets. No neighbor, priority boarding etc. Better even, as for flights departing from LIS, you may chose your meal on a menu emailed previously by TAP. Meal that was good by the way. Crew was extremely efficient and present.

### "such a downgraded product in Business Class"
A lot might be said about travelling during pandemic times. It is hard for passengers, and hard for crews, as well as airlines management. I would like to point out how disappointing was my first trip on the new A330Neo by TAP: Business class cabin is an extremely high density place, much more packed than on their A330-200. There are so many passengers and they are so close each other that is now a noisy place. As a consequence, seats are too narrow. And place for legs and feet were not sufficient for me. I could not move at all (seat 5A). Feeling of a magnetic resonance imaging bed. I started to feel bad. This is a typical profit targeting mistake. It is no use paying for a business class ticket, if you cannot breath. Worse: as (I suppose) a pandemic protection, business class toilet was for crew only. 34 business class pax had to share 2 toilets with 80 Economy Extra pax. I let you guess the result after a 9 hours flight, as crew never cleaned. Which is by the way, a bad decision in Covid times. My opinion is that TAP Portugal, for the first time, is offering such a downgraded product in Business Class that they will lose their most loyal ( 40 years) customers. Do not pay for it, even cheap.

### "Staff not very welcoming and quite robotic"
I was a but worried about a transatlantic crossing on an A21neo LR. The business class throne/pod seat was very comfortable, cabin felt new and modern, and the entertainment system was easy to use and had good content. Food was fine but a bit slow to be served - 65 minutes from take off and only 14 business passengers. For a short night flight it would have been nice with an express service (there is no pre dinner drink service anyway. Pillow is very good. Staff not very welcoming and quite robotic (well confused robotic). Flight left 50 min late but arrived on time. No business class bus service on arrival. Luggage arrived very quickly.

### "can improve in all sides of their product"
We entered in the last minute, due to a late incoming TAP flight, so we cannot say anything about the boarding process. We sat down in our seats, we had the two middle seats (1-2-1). Felt the seats were a bit narrow. They have put a menu on each table, and a stewardess walk her way down to take our orders. Before they came to our row (9), we heard she said they were out of beef. And when she came to take our order, we could choose between baccalao and spinach pasta. I should have understood that if i wanted beef, i should have ordered it online, before the flight. I told her i did not want any dinner. It took almost 1.5 hours before they cane with the drink trolley. Another stewardess offered me a beef stew that they served in a bowl. The taste was actually good, but looked boring . We had a big tv screen, and enough choices of movies. After dinner they turned of the lights, nice to relax, but do they need to keep the temperature on around 30 degrees ? Its so warm when i tried to lay down and sleep. They served a light meal one and a half hour before arrival, When we came to Punta Cana there was remote parking, and they got us in to two busses, very crowded. I have had trips with 5-stars airlines before the covid-19, and the difference is really big. TAP can improve in all sides of their product, disappointing trip.

### "worst travel experience"
Madrid to New York. Even before the flight it was impossible to speak with customer service about adding additional baggage. This was a problem because it is cheaper to add baggage before going to the airport, however in the end we had to pay the maximum cost because we could never get a hold of customer service over the phone. At check in, we were checked in by a third party company that could not help us with any questions related to TAP Portugal. One flight was delayed and when we arrived to the connecting airport they treated us like we were responsible for the delayed flight. Then when we got to Newark they didn't have our stroller set (which included 3 seat attachments and the bassinet for our son to sleep in). No TAP representative was present in Newark to help locate the stroller or take a report of the lost stroller. Eventually when we arrived to the final destination and there was no stroller. I tried calling them many many times and I was always on hold for at least an hour or longer. When someone picked up the phone, I was transferred and then placed on hold for another hour or longer. When I messaged them on Facebook I was replied to with a generic message and no one was there to help me. I tried messaging on LinkedIn, Facebook, and received absolutely zero assistance. No one has been able to help us with our lost stroller. Even today I am trying to call them and I am on hold for hours, with receiving any help or speaking with anyone. Do not use this company, if you do make sure you have third party flight and baggage insurance, because if they lose something they are not going to be responsible. Literally the worst travel experience we could have imagined.

### "The worst airline ever!"
The worst airline ever! Munich to Lisbon Was the only flight that went ok. I had trouble place finding a place to put my rucksack and the stewardess didn’t care. Lisbon to Newark a horrible flight. They didn’t have any veg or vegan options, apparently you need to order special meals. During boarding, they caught me for additional screening to answer questions and searching our bags and body. After the meal service they forgot to bring drinks to my row. When I asked the stewardess, she said she is busy and didn’t bother to come back. I had to ask another colleague of hers to bring us something to drink. Return flight New York to Lisbon the worst flight ever. The flight was scheduled to depart JFK on the 3/1/22 at 22:00 but due to technical issues or whatever (the staff at the gate didn’t inform passengers about the delay) the flight only took off on the 4/1/22 at 12:46 ish. Due to this, I missed my connecting flight in Lisbon. At JFK, the staff told us to contact staff in Lisbon as soon as we land but unfortunately, there was no staff at all to assist. TAP Portugal rebooked me into another flight leaving to Munich 7 hours later. I was originally going to get to Munich on the 4/1/22 at 16:50 but due to the delay now I would be landing on the 4/1/22 at 23:25. When I asked if they could give me an earlier flight or give me a place to wait at the airport with less crowd, one of the TAP staff said they can’t do anything and I have to wait like a regular passenger for 7 hours. He said “it’s not their fault“. I spoke to another staff and this time after confronting he gave a 16 € food voucher for 7 hour delay. Lisbon to Munich was the only flight that went smooth without any issues.

### "One of the worst experiences"
Not Verified | One of the worst experiences I have ever had. Stay away from this company especially during COVID-19, they do not offer any refund nor allow you to reschedule your flight. As many others unaware passengers, I was fooled by the claim that rescheduling was free of charge. Unfortunately, this is not only false, but TAP does not allow you to reschedule your flight either, regardless of additional fees. This means that any booking is lost. Since TAP does not have a working online service and the operators never reply to the phone, refund is not possible even if you have flight insurance. I spent over 8 hours at the phone and it is the same story: the operators do not pick up the phone or redirect you to a loop of other operators putting you on hold for hours. The outcome of this process is the charge on your phone (unless you are using a Portuguese number). You will soon notice a pattern: in the remote event that an operator replies, you are redirected to another one and so on for hours. Be aware of this and do not be accommodating, leave negative feedbacks and let them hear your voice. The scam machine does not stop to that, with very high fees (hundreds of euros) for extra-sized/weighted baggage and shady requirements, the extra fees are around the corner. Although they claim a classic 55x40x20 bag requirement, intentional random contestations are frequent and it will be difficult to prove your case unless you bring a ruler with you. Before booking with them, really consider the chance of being targeted by one of their scam loops and ending up paying more than a high-yield ticket with any other company. Seats are less comfortable when compared to other competitors in the same price range, do not have phone chargers, are very old and quite dirty. The food was plain, but it still gave me an upset stomach. Overall, this is a disastrous company without passenger assistance at any level (online, on the ground, at the phone). Do not book with them in any form: not on their website and absolutely not by agency (this would double the time you need to waste on the phone with no results). Try to skip TAP and jump to other companies when you're searching for a flight: price differences, if any, are illusory. Instead you will get disservice, lose a lot of your time and possibly several hidden fees.

### "Extremely dissatisfied with this company"
Extremely dissatisfied with this company. Stay away from TAP at any cost, the price is not worth the disservice. Do not fly with this company during the COVID-19 pandemic since they do not offer any refund for lost flights due to covid positivity. They consider any missed flight a no-show and deny any reimbursement. To do this, they rely on a loop created by the 24h requirement for most COVID tests. They will ask you to send documentation to their email address and they will not provide any reply. When the flight has passed, they will claim it as a no-show and deny refund according to their policy. Be aware and avoid this company, near-bankruptcy does not justify such embarrassing behavior. Flights are very uncomfortable, missing basic elements including phone chargers. The equipment is very old and poorly maintained. Food is poor quality, although not the worst I've had on an aircraft. On-board WI-FI does not work. The staff are unhelpful. The operators often hung up on you in order not to reply or to delay your assistance. As practical example, I spent nearly 3 hours on hold with no useful assistance. The ground staff at the airport is useless: they do not have access to any modification/change of your reservation. The online system is worthless, it does not allow modifications when they are needed, probably due to a precise intent to deny reimbursement. Fees and charges are far above average for extra baggage. A fee is charged for extra size and weight which can potentially add up to hundreds of euros per baggage. Although this information is not clearly accessible on TAP website, it can be found online from other sources. In summary, avoid this company at any cost. There are many other companies with similar prices that offer a better service. Do not book with this company during the COVID-19 pandemic since they do not offer any refund on tickets. Due to general disservice it may also be unsafe and dangerous to travel with them. In the unfortunate event that you have already booked a flight with them, basic survival tips include: do not check-in your bags at the airport to minimize the contact with the staff. Instead, check every bag online and go directly to the gate: due to the poor service, no scales or meters are available at the gate and it's more likely to avoid tricks on the baggage. For COVID-related refunds there is almost nothing to do, be careful not to get it so that they cannot capitalize on your sickness. In any case, communicate with them by certified email with confirmation receipt and never leave a phone call without any email confirmation. As a final note, do not leave any positive feedback on the phone surveys until you have your issue completely resolved (which will most likely never happen). This is a final trick they use to deny you proper treatment and make it result as a positive feedback: when they bounce you around between operators or ask you to call back, leave no feedback or a negative feedback after the call.

### "won't refund my tickets"
Not Verified | They changed my flight which wouldn't work for me and won't refund my tickets. I have been on the phone with them for 11 months and every time they say a refund is being processed. Now every time I call its a new excuse. Last excuse was too much time has passed even though I started the refund process or ROR as they call it. Every time being on hold for well over an hour.

### "they pleasantly surprised us"
Since Brussels Airlines doesn’t offer business class on the BRU-LPA route we decided to fly business class to LPA with TAP via LIS. After reading many reviews our expectations weren’t high but they pleasantly surprised us. Check in was fast and smooth with on time departures and arrivals. Fresh and clean looking cabin with a curtain between business and economy and seats with a good pitch and adjustable headrest. Crews were great and they did the utmost to please us. Meals were surprisingly good and tasteful and there was no shortage in the wide selection of drinks. We enjoyed the short layover in Lisbon as the TAP Premium Lounge was great and exceeding our expectations as well. My next trip to LPA will definitely be with TAP again

### "unbelievably frustrating experience"
Not Verified | TAP Portugal was the worst airline experience I have ever had the misfortune of flying on. Upon arriving at the gate of my connecting flight, two hours in advance, I was told that my American vaccine pass would not work and only EU passes were accepted. I had read every email sent to me, visited the website several times, and even looked up if American vaccine passes were allowed. I was forced to sprint through the airport with the many other people that were turned away and go to take a covid test. The covid test was in terminal 1 (we were in terminal 5). We were then forced to pay $400 to get a test to board the plane. I barely made it back before the gates closed. Many passengers missed the flight. Upon arriving in Portugal (my connecting destination) the plane took more than an hour to de-board. We were then all forced on to buses and driven to the airport which was not a short distance away. By the time I got to my connecting flight, I still had thirty minutes before the flight took off, however, they had shut the doors and didn’t let any of the people from my connection onto the flight as it was already overbooked. This caused me to miss the train I had paid for and my Airbnb check-in time. I went to the help desk as I was frustrated with the situation and all they said was that I could contact them through a link on their website. I never heard back after several attempts to contact them. TAP Portugal also had different rules at different airports. For example: we were required to buy surgical masks as opposed to cloth masks after not having to wear them for several flights. This made flying extremely unreliable and I never knew what to expect. To make matters worse, the Portugal airport is completely incompetent. They don’t give gate information until 90mins before the flight takes off and you have to go through a passport check once receiving that information. This makes it so 100s of people are standing in a line angry and trying to rush to get to their gates because many were missing their flights. People were cutting in line which made other passengers mad. The passport checkers ended up having to calm people down and stop people from cutting in line which made the process twice as long. Also, the airport had several long escalators broken. This gets very frustrating while running through the airport with heavy bags or things like strollers. Overall I would not recommend TAP airline or the Portugal airport to anyone. It was an unbelievably frustrating experience that cost time and money in the end. The entire process felt like a scam.

### "no one can tell me where my baggage is"
Not Verified |  As a heads up to any people going on a cruise or a boat, 3 people have told me (at the cruise company, airport and hotel respectively) that TAP Portugal tends to lose or delay baggage when traveling internationally (or maybe just whenever). I have to leave on a boat to Grenada in 24h and no one can tell me where my baggage is. (TAP Portugal does not have a baggage phone line, just a complaint/tracking baggage form, which is telling). United can tell me where and when my bag was last scanned but TAP can’t tell me if they even got my bag at all.

### "As bad as bad gets"
As bad as bad gets. Ground support is non existant. I had to wait 2 hours in a queue to speak to the one of only 3 tap employees in the terminal, or this is what I was told. Let's be clear TAP on nov 26th only had 3 staff at their home airport to assist clients, no management at all or so I wad told. TAP uses 99% third party staff at their home airport, Ground Force, if you encounter problems they have very limited power to do anything. Probably it was better they only had 3 staff as 2 of them were very rude. Not just to me but they shouted at people from India like they are cattle not humans, i was offended by their manner. I strongly recommend people avoid using TAP, if you look at my reviews i am more frequently positive than negative but this company had a bad heart and i will not use them again.

### "This airline is unresponsive"
This airline is unresponsive as most reviews have attested already. My suggestion is you do not contact them 'directly' but instead complain on the online Complaints Book, a legally established citizenship tool in Portugal. If they do not answer you in the mandatory 15 days as they won't, ask for the intervention and send the complaint to the Portuguese Civil Aviation Authority (ANAC). It is very likely the answer will still be absolutely inadequate if not absurd. In that case, ask for the arbitration of the Ombudsman, a State body with constitutional consolidation. You can do all this online. My latest contacts with this airline have been sui generis, they refused to sent me electronic tickets of flights bought in an online travel agency and answered my question two months after a flight saying I couldn't take a TV with me, even though I brought it with no problems. They do not follow rules and aren't compelled to do so, because unfortunately most passengers don't know how to claim their rights.

### "No customer service"
I don’t know why TAP Portugal  offer an online HELP system because they never responded to my emails over a problem which was I inexplicably spelt the surname wrong on a reservation I was making for a friend who was joining me on the above flight. The spelling was only spotted when the check-in online was done 36 hours before the flight. Two emails were sent to the TAP Portugal head office in Lisbon asking for help, no response so I spent 16 minutes in a telephone call waiting for an agent after explaining the problem about the flight which cost 89 euros i was eventually told the name could not be corrected and that a new ticket would have to be purchased .With no other solution i purchased a new ticket which cost 604 euros. This certainly leaves me and my friends with a bad experience of dealing with this airline. No customer service and just willing to rip a person off for a simple spelling mistake. Do Tap ever read these reviews because from what I can see there is a lot of distrust and room for a great deal of improvement in customer service.

### "denied me access because of a Covid test"
They have the worst customer service ever. TAP air personnel not professional at all. When I ask the them about the Covid requirements for my destination, no one knew that they were. When I was about to take my flight, the TAP associate denied me access because of a Covid test requirement that no one ever told me. They were rude and unrespectful. They do not inform you of the requirements and no compensation at all. They do not care about their customer at all.

### "lounge has been reduced to the strict minimum service"
Flying Business Class or Premium Economy is no use in Faro: no Priority lane at security check (by the way very very long), and no lounge available for TAP passengers. No Priority lane at boarding checks! In Lisbon, TAP lounge has been reduced to the strict minimum service, and could not be called a VIP lounge anymore. Note that vintage port is available at the bar. E190 had only 1 line of Business class seats (1 rank), but stickers "reserved to business class passengers" up to 6 ranks. An unprepared crew member tried to prevent non Business Class member to store their cabin luggage in them, and was very rude. A riot started. He did not give up and boarding was stopped. Then chief purse intervened. Then he ignored us for the entire flight.

### "Staff totally overworked"
Not Verified |  Business check in is catastrophic. Almost lost my plane waiting 90min! Luggage went to wrong airport. Staff totally overworked. Never again TAP - take another plane.

### "how do they expect we redeem our vouchers?"
A party of 13 people - Flights cancelled twice due to Covid - I can accept that but issued vouchers and then cancelled the Budapest to Lisbon route. So we had to book with other airlines. As we live in Budapest and TAP no longer fly to Hungary how do they expect we redeem our TAP vouchers? TAP expect us to fly to Lisbon with another airline to then book TAP flights and thereby redeem claim back what’s rightfully ours. Totally unreasonable. Do they not realise or care what the bad feeling created from 13 annoyed customers and negative reviews on websites like this do to their already damaged brand.

### "they totally not refund money"
Not Verified |  Horrible airline. Flight was cancelled due to covid, but we still almost 7 months later for a refund of our tickets. These guys are criminal as they totally not refund money of our tickets.

### "Waste of money and energy!"
Never book with TAP Portugal! I booked my flight back home last April and they changed my itinerary (Toronto instead of Montreal) which is not at all the same place. It’s not because you are in Canada that two different cities make no difference! So I had to cancel my flight and they told me I would get a refund in 90 days. I never got the refund and it’s been 9 months! Waste of money and energy!

### "Beyond useless staff"
Supposed to fly from Málaga to Lisbon to catch a connecting flight hours later to Toronto. Showed up early, 2nd in line only to be to they're oversold. Thanks and bye. Beyond useless staff. They deserve to go broke. Save everyone a lot of trouble like we faced today.

### "I have yet to receive a refund"
I bought a ticket for this airline, my flight was canceled 15 days before my flight and I had to book a ticket from another airline. I was told I would be refunded since March 15th 2021. It is now November 5th 2021 and I have yet to receive a refund, I call them every month and I am told my refund has been submitted and still I have yet to receive the refund.

### "I was made to miss my flight"
Not Verified |  Avoid this airline, their staff are poorly trained with zero customer service care. Tried boarding a flight from Lisbon, I arrived at the Airport in good time, due to a small corrections on the passenger location form, I was made to miss my flight and to make matters worse, they have only 2 customer service officer serving over 50 passenger who fell into the same category. I was on the queue from 10 am and at 2 pm I am yet to be served.

### "company lacks good leadership"
This company lacks good leadership, but the crew is more and more an asset. That's pretty much it. They simply disregard anything else, including complaints. If Portugal had a serious regulator entity for aviation, TAP would be forced to behave appropriately with its passengers.

### "this airline is not bad at all"
I went to many sites and read horrible reviews about TAP Portugal, so I was almost sure my experience would be bad. I even thought my flight would’ve been cancelled without previous, because that’s also something I read online a lot. To my surprise, both flights were on time, the aircraft was new, I had free wifi for 1 h, the flight attendants were ultra nice, the entertainment was good, the food was much better than popular airlines, and they offered a baby package for my 1 y.o. soon (with a portable changing table, a teddy, a pacifier holder among other baby things). If I can suggest something is to build you own experience, this airline is not bad at all.

### "charged an arm and a leg"
Not Verified | Chicago to Rome via Lisbon. Suggestions for flying with this airline: Book each leg separately. If you don't and there's a change to one leg that makes another leg impossible (like a change that makes you miss your connecting flight because of an impossible 1-hour international layover), then you'll be charged an arm and a leg for changes to make that connecting flight. Booking separately is important because most airlines have an "all or nothing" flight policy. It means you either complete all legs of the trip, or you won't complete any. So in the case that you're afraid of missing your connecting flight back to the US, you can't just book an earlier flight to make the connecting flight (or hop on in the middle for that matter). This is because if you miss your first flight all remaining legs will be canceled. Based on other reviews, my experience, and how loose this airline is with their scheduling give yourself that autonomy. The little extra money that you spend will be worth what you save in a headache.

### "Will never fly them again!"
Flew with my Fiancé from Cancun, Mexico to Funchal, Portugal. The food on my two flights was the worst of any airline I have flown and I fly extensively. Reached my destination and my luggage did not arrive so I had to fill out a lost luggage claim which I did. Even though I was very tied after my journey I had to so out shopping to get incidentals and clothes for the next day which I did. The next day there was still no word about my luggage so I had to continue buying things of necessity that I did not have because of the delayed luggage. Two days after arriving my luggage was found and finally returned to me. After submitting my expenses to TAP Portugal for my incidental expenses to be reimbursed it touch one month and they replied with an email apologizing for losing my luggage and then informing me that they will only cover 100 Euros per person per day. What an insult that I had to go shopping while tired because of them and spend my vacation shopping instead of enjoying myself because of them and they're main concern is to limit their liability for a bad situation they caused. I have had my luggage delayed 3 other times with other airlines and never did I receive an email limiting me to 100 euros per day per person. The other airlines covered up to $3000 US dollars and I never spent close to that on past delayed baggage. With TAP Portugal I only spent a little over 500 Euros and they send me a letter like this and asking me to send them receipts of what I purchased when I already sent it to them. I resend them copies of my receipts and it has been over 3 months since requesting a refund and I still have not heard back from them or received my refund. Will never fly them again!

### "still waiting for them to pay us"
Not Verified |  We actually flew in March 2020. Our flight home to Manchester from Banjul was cancelled but they didn’t bother to tell us, we only found out because friends went to the office and found it locked with a message stuck on the door. The staff were hiding in the back office! We had to book alternative flights home to Gatwick as the Manchester flights were fully booked, then get overnight accommodation until we could get a train to Manchester. They contacted us to say the flight was cancelled 5 days after we arrived home! To date (October 2021) we are still waiting for them to pay us for the flights, accommodation and train travel that we paid over £1,200 for. Whenever we ring, we are put on hold for ages, then someone tells us our refund will be dealt with ASAP! They told us our case was closed because we hadn’t responded to an email that we didn’t get and we would have to start the process over again. Stay away from this company. I dread to think what would have happened if we’d been on a budget and had no spare cash to get home.

### "absolute worst"
Not Verified | Boston to Dublin via Lisbon. Never ever even consider attempting to book a reservation with this airline! The absolute worst most frustrating and disappointing experience I have ever had attempting to just pay for a flight. If i did not have a voucher that I needed to use I would never of persisted for days with hours on hold and all the disconnected phone calls. Stay far far away from this horrible airline.

### "Avoid at any cost!"
Not Verified |  TAP Portugal - worst experience in my life! The way they have been treating their customers and the refund is appalling. Making customers chase the refund for the flights that were cancelled more than a year ago is unacceptable. The reasons for refund delays given by their customer service staff are made up and inconsistent. I was told to wait 6 months, then 2 weeks, then 2 days, and then eventually just wait. The flight was cancelled in June 2020 and I am still chasing my refund back with no luck at all. I will never use this company again as they are unreliable and not trustworthy at all. Avoid at any cost!

### "failed to make the refund"
Not Verified |  We were due to fly with TAP Portugal but were unable to due to covid. We requested a refund which they agreed to but 6 months on they have failed to make the refund. They are a terrible organisation - avoid at all costs.

### "They provide the poorest service one can expect"
I requested a refund for three tickets more than a year ago and am still waiting for the refund payment to be made (>£1,200). Every attempt to contact TAP customer service is always a complete waste of time. Attendants are very unprepared and never provide a plausible answer/reason for the delay (and I patiently respected all deadlines initially given but then once payment was overdue, they simply stopped bothering to provide a deadline or an explanation). Furthermore, it is useless to make a formal complaint on their website as they simply close it after months "processing" the complaint with no action taken or notification of the outcome sent to the customer. If you want to be treated respectfully and have your complaints and dozens of emails replied with a satisfactory reason/deadline that any decent customer service would do, stay away from TAP Airlines. They provide the poorest service one can expect (or no service at all as my flight never took off!) and have no shame in keeping your money in the end. I'd rather not fly at all if the only option I had available was flying with TAP airlines. Had other flights cancelled for same reason (COVID-19 crisis) by British Airways, Iberia and KLM in the exact same period and all followed the refund process and provided updates if delays were expected eventually making the payments within a reasonable time. I'm sorry but flying with TAP will never be my choice again.

### "an overall unpleasant experience"
Not Verified |  Unfriendly and slow check-in staff, disorganized, late boarding, just an overall unpleasant experience and I haven’t even hit Lisbon customs and security. On the way to Rome via Lisbon, they had one customs official for hundreds of people-same for security. Many of us were uncertain which line to get into and also missing connecting flights. Will never, ever fly this airline again. Pay the extra money to fly a different airline.

### "The flight attendants were non-existent and down right, not nice"
Horrible for the price you pay! From the food selections in the TAP Business Lounge in Lisbon which has the same insipid selections in April when we were there to September. The menu had not changed. To the service on the aircraft. Once you are seated in business class, you are not offered a drink until dinner service which was 1.5 hour later. No welcome on board aperitif nor a juice. You are offered a selection of mains and we were seated in the 3rd row, only 2 other people seated in front of us. We asked for the fish selection and to our great surprise, no fish. The flight attendants were non-existent and down right, not nice. For the price that you pay to fly in Business Class you expect Business Class service, which TAP Airlines does not offer. This is not an isolated incident. We have flown 6 other times and we keep on saying that we will give it another shot because their connections are good to our final destination. On one occasion this summer, we get to the airport and are told that the flight had been cancelled due to a strike. No warning beforehand. Our next option was to fly out in 3 days! Not! We had to book on another carrier at exorbitant prices to get back home. Never again. Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me".

### "they have the best product"
TAP is world top when it comes to excellent pilot training and maintenance. I have been flying them since 1976, in the last 16 years always in business class on European routes, where they have the best product with excellent wine and food, chilled espumante, friendly crew (every now and then like in any airline a moody crew member). They do not let you down  if a flight gets cancelled.

### "just so customer unfriendly"
They hang up me on the phone because they don't want to send me the e-ticket for two passengers, whom paid 438 euros, but bought the tickets on a online travel agency. Obviously the online travel agency is just an intermediary of the buying process of TAP tickets. TAP is just so customer unfriendly that one has to wonder how this bizarre company are still flying. The passengers urgently need their electronic tickets for governmental reimbursememt purposes but they won't collaborate.

### "the worst experience ever"
I had the worst experience ever flying TAP First time we took TAP airport and I suspect the last time First we book premium economy. It was just a regular economy When we mentioned none even explained why ? We waited 3 hrs just to get a water on the plane. When later I asked for one more I did not get it. Flight attendants so rude. The biggest problem is that again we payed for premium economy but it was just regular economy. We are extremely disappointed. I will discourage anyone to fly TAP.

### "The worst customer service"
The worst customer service I have ever seen. I had a flight booked in executive class from Boston to Madrid. I had a late connection but made it to the check in desk 59 min prior to flight. The app would not let me check in online. The gate agent had gone to assist with boarding. We notified the gate we were there and could not go to gate without boarding passes. The agent said we would have to wait and then did not return till the boarding gate was closed. We tried to rebook and she said she could not book us because executive was full the following day. We offered to accept a downgrade to be able to get there but she said she was not allowed to do that and no flights were available that week. We booked a flight on delta to Madrid the following day. We stopped by tap to ensure we could take our return flight. They had marked us as a no show and cancelled the return flight as well. We have called, emailed, messages through the website and no one will even discuss it. The just refer to another dept and now I am being referred back to where I started. I was in executive class and can’t even get a company response. I highly suggest not doing business with this airline.

### "not allowed to board as she didn't have a PCR"
Not Verified |  Canada changed travel restrictions 3 days before boarding. I was with my 5 year old. Made it all the way to the boarding gate when I was informed by a tap agent my 5 year old would not be allowed to board as she didn't have a PCR. It took 6 hours to clear customs grab my bags. I was told by the TAP agent who did not allow me on the flight that it is their job to check info before being given boarding passes and that I should speak to an agent before leaving the airport to re schedule a flight. I waited 2 hours at a complaints office, 2 hours later I still hadn't spoken to anyone. I left the airport with my 5 year old. I purchased 3000 dollar tickets home with TAP 2 days later. They hung up on me when I attempted to claim a voucher. The boarding was a joke they cram everyone into a small section with no seats available. Senior in wheel chairs lined up. Flight left 1 30 min late.

### "Friendly, on time and good value for money"
Not Verified |  Booked a return business class ticket from Amsterdam via Lisbon to Faro a few months before travel. Received a few emails about schedule (and equipment) changes which were then easily made online following a link giving a lot of flexibility. This review is for the return flight from Faro to Amsterdam. Check-in at Faro quick, but no lounge, which should have been communicated. Boarding on time and with priority for business passengers. TAP used its subsidiary Portugalia - on some flights - which does also offer a separate business class section (curtained off) but with 2-2 seating on the EMB-aircraft does not offer an empty seat between business seats. So although there seemed a bit more leg space, it was well below average business class seating, which is typically an empty seat between 2 seats or a seat blocked on the 2-seater row. Lovely and cheerful crew offering coffee, juice or water on the short hop to Lisbon. Lisbon Airport is hit or miss and seems disorganized, although a remote stand was announced, we docked at a gate, but ground staff was obviously unaware so it took a while to deplane. Quick visit to the TAP lounge that had moved from my last visit to a nice bright space with serviced bar and buffet. Lounge food was never very good here and again did disappoint, staff friendly and helpful, lounge clean with lots of attention for social distancing. Very early boarding call for the LIS to AMS leg. Extensive covid documentation check before boarding a bus to a remote stand. Portugalia's EMB 195 seems a have a bit more luxurious seats, nice cabin but the 2-2 seating in business class is a problem especially with economy class half empty (just move the curtain to have business class passengers be able to spread out, right?). Again a lovely crew, bar/dinner service combined and from a trolley. Here is where things go wrong. Obviously the EMB-aircraft don't have a sizeable oven, so only cold food. Despite an invite during booking from TAP to select my entree, no reference or explanation why it was just a cold platter and no choice. Very disappointing. The tray does not look bad and the food is fine, a bit heavy on meat and not very sophisticated. Staff kept offering refills even though I think I heard an automated announcement during boarding that alcohol would be limited. Flight on-time with early arrival in Amsterdam, but then accumulated a delay because of ridiculous taxi times at Schiphol and a slew of miscommunications in getting the plane to dock and disembark. All in all TAP does an acceptable job when you travel business class even though seating arrangement is sub standard. Friendly, on time and good value for money. Communication on some of the service lapses could be better.

### "no onboard service or checked luggage"
A domestic flight of one hour and twenty minutes in a flag carrier on 'discount' fare cost 242,73 euros and included no onboard service or checked luggage. This will automatically keep equaling a one star review for me. I am finding it quite amusing the reviews from Canadians, Americans and British saying TAP is 'cheap' when it is the Portuguese who are supporting these exorbitant prices to travel in their own country, identical to transatlantic flights. I hope the EU Commission is as bold with TAP as it was with Alitalia and save Portuguese taxpayers and Portugal's name from this mafia of the air. Flight on schedule and generous legroom on exit row. I asked for a cup of water and crew seem worried that I was interrupting their conversation in the galley.

### "A real rip-off"
We cancelled the trip from Miami to Casablanca (Morocco) in October of 2020 due to COVID-19. We literally spent hours on the phone (every call was 2-3 hs.) with TAP until they gave us vouchers for the tickets valid for one year. This year we tried to use the vouchers and again after hours and hours on the phone we end up paying double of money as the original tickets plus the redeeming of the vouchers. So, we lost it all of the original tickets plus we paid almost double for the same tickets. A real rip-off and a terrible wasting time on the phone.

### "even though the ticket is cheaper, you still end up paying more"
Back in June, I booked my ticket to Lisbon for 4 months later because they advertised "1 free change, up to 3 days before the flight". With the COVID situation still not looking too good, I wanted to move my flight to next year. The total cost of the new flight is $100 less than the original flight, so you would think that I do not need to pay anything extra. However, they structured the new ticket in a deceiving way so that even though the ticket is cheaper, you still end up paying more. Here is how. My original ticket was made up of around $600 base fare and $50 airline surcharge. The new ticket is $250 base fare and $300 airline surcharge. This means that the new base fare ($250) is covered by what I originally paid ($600), but I now have to pay $250 extra to make up the difference in the airline surcharges ($50 vs 300). Also another $50 in taxes/fees, bringing the total to $300 extra, to change to a cheaper flight. This is completely deceiving and dishonest. They intentionally offered "free changes" and then jacked up the airline surcharge and decreased the base fare so that customers would still have to pay to change their flight. How did I find this out? It is not written anywhere explicitly. I spent over 2 hours waiting to speak to someone on the phone, and when I finally got someone, she gave me a vague response about the base fare needing to be equal or higher. This obviously does not sufficiently explain what's really going on, but she kept repeating this and provided no other explanation. She never once mentioned the significant airline surcharge increase. Only after comparing the cost breakdown of the two flights myself, I found where the $300 discrepancy came from. When I questioned the 600% jump in airline surcharge fees, she simply answered that it fluctuates and can happen. As someone planning to purchase a second home in Portugal, I will never use this airline again for any of my future travels, and I will tell my family and friends to avoid as well. Lesson learned.

### "there has been no response from the airline"
The flight was fine considering it was in March 21 2020 at the start of Covid. However as this was a flight covered by my Insurance, I requested a simple note from TAP in September 2020 stating that there was no refund provided or forthcoming for the $2,000 ticket I purchased. This was a prerequisite from the Insurance company in order to pay out the claim. To this date September 2021 and after numerous hour long hold phone calls to very nice people at TAP there has been no response from the airline. Even the request of an explanation of the very confusing "electronic" ticket with some charges in euro, some in Canadian dollars and all with code letters that nobody understands, fell on deaf ears. Hate to find out what would happen if I actually had a monetary request. Worst customer service from friendly people without head office back up!

### "the flight was on time"
The cabin on this 6am flight was full but very silent with the exception of the crew at the rear who were enthusiastically speaking about personal matters for anyone willing to hear. Apart from that, the crew were friendly, the flight was on time, but hit a lot of turbulence particularly when approaching Lisbon. If you are feeling lucky, book TAP and pray nothing goes wrong or that you don't need to contact them before your flights. That's my advise to you.

### "Don't click on change/pay seat"
The flight was uneventful, the A319 was impeccable, however I had the brilliant idea of ordering a lasagna. They bought it still on the package sold in the supermarket - their "catering" is offered by a Swiss company, according to the receipt I got. Cabin crew was nice. Don't click on "change/pay seat" when making your check-in on TAP website, this will mean you won't be able to return to the original allocated seat. I called them and spent 40 minutes until their Brazilian call center thought it was time to speak to me. They can do absolutely nothing. On boarding, the famous twisted staff at Lisbon airport, made me wait on premium boarding line until they lengthily fixed the issue in a very displeased manner.

### "No assistance at the airport"
Not Verified |  Awful experience, they cancelled my flight once, then put me on another flight but I got there too late (because they were 40 minutes late with the first flight). No assistance at the airport, no information whatsoever, I received a message saying that I have to fly to Amsterdam and then Rome. It will take me 10 hours to go from Lisbon to Rome and didn't have any sort of help. Never again.

### "dishonest airline decides to cancel your booking"
Not Verified |  The fares are low and it’s tempting, but don’t do it. I booked a round trip flight but was informed the evening before the first flight that the schedule had been changed. The proposed new flight had a 10+ hour layover and a post-midnight arrival time, but the email from TAP included a “Confirm or Change Flights” link. The link offers the option to change both the departing and return flights free of charge. I changed the departing flight that night, but, a few days later, checked to see if it was still possible to change the return flight, and it was. The website clearly stated that the cost of the change was “€0,00” and even included a message noting that “changes to this journey are free of charge.” I decided to push my return flight back a few days. The change was confirmed on the website and was viewable under my bookings. Fast forward to the night before this rescheduled flight, when I have not received a check in email. Finding that odd, I logged into my TAP account to find that the return booking - which had been viewable one day prior - did not exist. I attempted to call the helpline and was greeted with an automated message letting me know that “customer service is available starting at 8am” before disconnecting. It was within the hours of operation listed on the website, but I guess they don’t follow those. At the airport, I arrive first at the check-in desk, at which the attendant tells me that he can see the return flight date change, but that I must collect a new ticket at the airline ticket desk. I arrive at the ticket desk and am told that the booking doesn’t actually exist because it was cancelled by TAP on the same day the change was made. So I’m left without the return flight I had paid for in my initial booking and changed, via TAP’s link, a few days earlier. I call the TAP customer support line again and receiving the same auto message (it’s 9:30am local time). I soon learn why TAP gives this bogus number: they want you to call the toll line. So I call, and after about half an hour, I speak to a nice representative who promises to confirm a new booking for later that day and transfers me to the ticket change desk. The ticket change desk picks up the phone after 45 minutes, and I speak to someone from TAP’s equivalent of the Politburo, who informs me that the booking does not exist, but I can pay $1000 for a new one. I explain that I’ve already booked a round trip ticket, that I changed it on the link provided by TAP, and that I am happy to pay the usual change fee (a ridiculous $270, but I digress). At this point the TAP agent’s logic changes: she tells me the flight change wasn’t supposed to be free, so when I booked it on TAP's website it didn’t process, and the confirmation message I received after changing it was a fluke. When I was a “no-show” for the original flight - for which I never received a check-in email - the journey auto-cancelled. This is different from what the ticket office told me - that the flight was cancelled by TAP immediately after the change request was submitted. Then, she begins to lecture me about not paying the change fee that TAP claimed didn’t exist - as if I’m the one being dishonest! So: fork over the extra $100 for Lufthansa or British Airways. You’ll save a headache, a toll call, and the surprise $600 you’ll have to spend when this dishonest airline decides to cancel your booking.

### "Don't ever book through TAP"
Not Verified |  Don't ever book through TAP. I tried changing my flight due to COVID and military orders. I called at least 10 times between June and August and every time I called I would be on hold for hours and when I finally got someone on the line there was an issues. Every person I spoke with gave me different information. First they told me I didn't have to pay for rescheduling my flight as long as I rescheduled by June 21. I called June 19 I called several times to rebook my flight but keep telling me I have to pay a fee when they had already told me I didn't have to. I spoke with several representatives, who directed me to Dial 2 then 3 then 1 in order to reach the Central department of alterations For booking waiver. I called that extension and representative told me to dial 2, 3, 2 instead which I did but every person I spoke with kept giving me different answers. I spent about 6 hours on the phone with TAP, most of that time I was on hold and none of these representatives seemed to be on the same page as they all told me different things. I even contacted them via email which was a waste of time because they never addressed my issue. My dad, who was also traveling with me called them because at this point I had given up, he asked them how much they would charge in fees to cancel the booking, they told him $172 was the fee so he cancelled the booking which was for 9 people, and told him it would take 7-10 business days to get the refund. It's been 28 days and I haven't received my refund yet, so I called to check on the status of my refund and not only they told me it can take up to 90 days to get the refund but also said they charged each passenger a fee of $340. So we lost over $3,000 just because TAP airlines representatives kept misinforming me and my dad. Booking with TAP airlines was a big mistake and I will discourage everyone I know from booking with them.

### "not allowed me to upgrade"
Worst service at Newark Airport, counter Employees without training and not speaking Portuguese. My luggage not mark as priority and not allowed me to upgrade to business  class were my reservation was entitled to.

### "I paid 224.37 euros for this domestic flight of one hour and twenty minutes"
Everything went fine, from checking in my out of format baggage in Funchal airport, to collecting it at Lisbon airport, the crew was professional and friendly, the cabin was well cleaned, the legroom and comfort was great on 'Xtra economy', nothing was served, but the prices of food onboard were quite reasonable. Nonetheless, I paid 224.37 euros for this domestic flight of one hour and twenty minutes which in my opinion is scandalous, therefore they will be getting one star reviews on Skytrax until they correct their recurring abuse of semi dominant position.

### "Everything was fine"
Pleasantly surprised, after the negative reviews I had read. The staff on board were friendly, clean airplane, enough legroom ( Seat 9A ). On board coffee and muffin not so expensive. Everything was fine.

### "refuses to give me the cash refund"
My flight was canceled due to corona and my travel agency requested a cash refund. TAP Portugal refused giving me a cash refund and gave me a voucher that expired 1 year later instead. It didn't make sense to fly anywhere due to the pandemic before the voucher expired but I still wanted to use it. So I tried booking a flight and always got an error message, saying my voucher wasn't valid. When I called customer service, they said my voucher couldn't have worked as I requested a cash refund. First TAP Portugal refuses to give me the cash refund I requested and gives me a voucher instead. Then they tell me the voucher they gave me couldn't work as I had requested a cash refund. Seriously?

### "no way better than a cheaper budget airline"
I’ve flown with TAP many times and they are in no way better than a cheaper budget airline, and are in fact far less organised. Avoid if possible! This most recent trip: I am a gold card member with TAP, a completely pointless exercise. They told me to arrive 5 hours early to the airport (for a 10am flight) due to strikes, as I could be in the lounge. After taking only 10 minutes to get through, I found the lounge was closed until 8, which they failed to let me know. Their customer services is terrible also until 8, though they are completely pointless even when you do get a hold of them. Then despite being a gold card member and having been kept waiting for 3 hours sitting on the ground they told me there was nothing they could do and only apologised when I said that was the least they could do. They also sent everyone to the gate 1.5 hours early but had no one there to let them into the waiting area so we were forced to cue or sit on the floor for 45 minutes. When I asked their customer service rep what the point/benefits were of being a member or customer with their company, they said: well I don’t know, I can’t really say any right now. The answer of course is none…

### "No solution provided"
Not Verified |  TAP has a history of flight delays on this route so the 1.15 overall delay was not a surprise. What was unacceptable was to have booked (and confirmed through call by TAP) a place for my dog in the pressurized cargo area and learn 30 min before (at bag drop) that the plane did not have a pressurized cabin and the dog as unable to be taken. No solution provided - just prepotent action by TAP. Fortunately I had a back up solution and left the dog at the origin. Still finding a way to bring the dog back home. Unbelievable .

### "charged 150.00 for my 2nd luggage"
Not Verified |  I booked my ticket called the number online to clarify luggage would be included, was told several times both my cases would be included at no extra charge. I flew out of San Francisco August 15th 2021. I was charged 150.00 for my 2nd luggage. I had a layover in Lisbon Portugal. The flight was late, I had 45 minutes to check in to my connecting flight. I was told to go to a website online, to fill out a locator form. My phone would not work in Portugal but was told to figure it out or I won't be able to board, I asked for a paper form and was told no. I finally got on the wifi with no help, filled out the form with no help when I asked questions. I had to pay 150.00 to order Covid tests to be mailed to me to do the at home tests because I didn't know which locations were close or what the hours were for tests. I was done with form 15 minutes prior to departure and told I wasn't getting on the flight as they had already closed the door. I was sent out of the terminal across the airport to customer service. I got to the line and waited for 3 hours and 40 minutes standing with no way of getting water or a chair, at this point my foot was swollen in my shoe. I asked the gentleman ahead of me to watch my luggage while I went to the restroom. I could barely put weight on my foot and was told I would lose my place in line if I left again. I got my new flight information and then had to go to a counter to get checked in, get a boarding pass and go through security. I was told my luggage had been transferred to the flight. When I finally made it back through the airport to my terminal to the gate I had to really push myself to stay on my feet. I was asked to do a new locator form and paid for yet another Covid test to be mailed to me. I got on another uncomfortable flight to Heathrow. When I went to baggage claim, my luggage was not there, they looked up my ticket and explained that Tap Portugal had not sent the luggage. I filled out the paperwork to have my luggage delivered to my address in UK. I called the next day to be told TAP still had not sent my luggage. I waited for my luggage, called next day no luggage. I called the airline to see what was needed and how to register my covid test for them for my return back to US. They said to follow instructions and it will be OK. Be 2 hours early and I would have enough time to get. Checked in have someone help me if needed. When I got to Heathrow 3.5 hrs early TAP told me my covid test would not be accepted so would have to change my flight. I tried to talk to them but they told me to go change my flight and get out of line. I went to United airline counter bought a whole new ticket, waited 8 hours at the airport and got home with no problems with United.

### "luggage did not make it on the flight"
We arrived in London Heathrow at 10.55 not one staff member to assist. Our luggage did not make it on the flight. We were told to go home and call the airline as no one was working. now I have been stuck in a dark hole with absolute no information. I have been on the phone for over 6 hours with no success no one answers or they transfer me to a department that no one answers. I had to drive all the way back to Heathrow to find out information again TAP staff would not take responsibility and sent me away I'm on the second day with still no information regarding me bags and no client assistant. This is beyond comprehending.

### "I will never fly with TAP Portugal again after our experience"
Not Verified |  This airline is an absolute joke when it comes to customer service. We emailed 4 weeks in advance and never heard back, we called and were on hold for 4 hours and never got a hold of anyone, we Facebook messaged, we did everything we could to get ahold of them. We bought a flight that originated in Barcelona and had a connecting flight in Lisbon that would then take us to San Francisco. We were in Lisbon and planned on just catching the flight connection here. We had a feeling we should just talk to TAP to make sure they knew we were doing that (again, we had tried contacting 4 weeks prior and couldn’t get ahold of anyone) and they wouldn’t help us because they were only handling flights from that same day. So we come back the next day and wait in a customer service representative line for 2 hours just to have them tell us that they will cancel our whole reservation if we didn’t get on where the flight originated in Barcelona. What?! They were so rude to us the entire time, and just told us that we had no other option but to buy a whole new flight for $1,200 and they would not be refunding us. Simply put, it was just such an illogical conversation it was painful. I will never fly with TAP Portugal again after our experience.

### "no clear indication of the fare rules"
Awful website with no clear indication of the fare rules - and pricing when booking is not clear. They should invest much more resources in creating a website that allows customers to do self service rather than having to rely on their call center waiting for a long time before anyone picks up. I got bounced at check-in at 5am because I was missing a covid document and their call center was closed until 8am so could get no assistance.

### "We almost did not make it back"
Not Verified |  The check-in was not organized. The boarding was not well organized. The command 'slides armed' was given when there were a lot of passengers and personel still standing. The seats were terrible, no support, not suited for tall people (short back of the chair) and no space for your legs. For a 4 hour flight not even a water was given. The crew did manage to take 1.5 hours for their paid service. While everybody was trying to sleep, they were stamping through the airplance. And to top all this, TAP sends #6 upgrade etc emails, but does not send an update requiring a antigen test, which TAP changed 2 days before return! We almost did not make it back.

### "customer service does not actually exist"
TAP canceled my flight and after a month still waiting my refund, probably the worst customer service ever. I purchased the ticket directly on TAP website. Have a frequent flyer with them, they used to do good job. But customer service does not actually exist.

### "I was unable to reach anyone that could help me"
Horrible customer service experience. I purchased a flight with TAP as they advertised with they provide 1 free flight change if a flight is booked before a certain date. When I needed to change it because of covid exposure I was unable to reach anyone that could help me. After being on hold for an hour or more, I would be told I had to be transferred to the 'flight change' people, where I was consistently hung up on. I had to pay 300 to change the flight which was about the same price of the flight. When I got to the airport to talk to someone since it's impossible by phone, Facebook, Skype, they told me they don't have a customer service rep at the airport. Horrible service, not only did I blow a bunch of money because of false advertising, I wasted at least 10 hours on hold trying to resolve the issue. I will not fly TAP again.

### "never use MyTrip or TAP Portugal"
I booked a flight from UK to Portugal when it was finally green to fly there (COVID regulations). A week after, it turned to amber but we still carried on with the booking as we were both vaccinated. 1 week prior to the booking, the government announced that some countries, Portugal included, are not accepting anyone to go in the country that have had specific vaccine batches not approved by the EU - I had one of them and therefore I could not travel. I have tried to get a refund or rebooking these flights but both MyTrip and TAP Portugal refused to help. I could not get through via phone and MyTrip takes over a week to respond to each email (TAP never have responded to one single email), never addressing the actual issue. After over a week of trying, I managed to make contact via phone and MyTrip tells me it is up to the airline to sort it out. When I eventually reach TAP (TAP hangs up on you several times before you actually get through to someone), they say it is not up to them but to the agency department of TAP which is not reachable for the customers. This huge case of miscommunication between the companies is not acceptable. I am then unable to go see my family and in addition I lost the money for a trip I paid so much for (I never go in high season but because of the situation, I chose to). I reiterate, never use MyTrip or TAP Portugal.

### "still unable to reschedule my flight"
Close to my return to the US, I fell sick with COVID-19. The moment I was confirmed positive, I sent all the documentation regarding my case to TAP Portugal as I was supposed to. Three days ago I initiated the re-booking process for a plausible return date. For three days, I have been spending each day from two to four hours on the phone with TAP Portugal transferred from an office to another. On my third day of nightmare, I am still unable to reschedule my flight back home. No answers. No help.

### "worst experience ever"
The worst experience ever. We supposed to have 1-hour layover in Lisbon. The first leg was delayed by 30 min. TAP did not bother announcing any instructions for transferring passengers. You are on your own - running, breaking lines for security etc. Made it to the gate? No direct passage to the plane. You’ll meet to take a ride. Now you go on the bus with a crowd of other passengers who also ran like no day tomorrow. So now you feel like a sardine shoulder-to-shoulder with other heavy-breathing passengers. COVID distancing? No, haven’t heard! Never again.

### "a complete nightmare"
Flying TAP Air Portugal was a complete nightmare. I fly frequently and I have never had such a terrible experience. I was stuck in Lisbon for 48 hours due to an airport staff. Not only did TAP Portugal (who knew about the strike 3 weeks before it happened!) fail to inform customers in a timely manner or reroute flights, but they also failed to provide housing, food, or even airport staff to tell us what was going on. Still no compensation for the hotel I had to pay for out of pocket in Lisbon and no news on items lost along the way. Truly the worst airline I have ever experienced. Unprofessional, rude, terrible customer service. Unless you have literally no other choice, avoid TAP Air Portugal at all costs.

### "have not received my refund back"
This is the worst airline I have ever ever had an experience with. Worst customer service. Our flights got canceled because of coronavirus in August 2020. Borders were closed couldn't travel. We were told we would be fully refunded back to our card. It is 1 year later and I still have not received my refund back. When I call I am on hold for hours & hours. Then they go help me finally. Then always hang up so have start all over. This is months & months of this go back & forth. I would never ever ever tell anyone to use this airline.

### "Avoid if you can"
The Tap Portugal check-in / bag drop-off experience at Lisbon airport is horrific. There are 3 different station types and no instructions where to go whatsoever. Crowds of frustrated travellers wander lost, wasting their time in multiple queues. Unfortunately, the assistance is hopeless and useless, unable to direct the crowd. There was one angry and very rude agent who pushed people in different directions. I have wasted 1h on something that shouldn’t have taken longer than 10 min. It is a shame to see bad a formerly decent airline has become. Avoid if you can.

### "Please do not use this airline!"
Please do not use this airline! After leaving my luggage behind on the outgoing trip and cancelling my original return flight, TAP Air Portugal outdid themselves when I attempted to check my luggage in when flying back from Morocco to the UK. The night before my flight I received an email stating that the airline had already checked me in without asking me first "for my comfort". I arrived early at CMN to check my luggage in only to be told that the UK government had moved Morocco from the amber list and it was now on the red list, hence I would not be allowed to board the plane. This was obviously not true, as a quick check of the UK government website confirmed. I informed the staff members only to be told that my only option to fly would be to book a quarantine hotel (£1750!) and they could transfer me on a flight to Heathrow. No attempt was made to take into account how their error would affect my plans. Indeed, I don't believe any attempt was made to acknowledge that there was anything wrong at all. In the end the check-in closed and I was left in the airport without a flight. Other travellers heading to the UK experienced the same issue. I went to an actually competent airline (Air France) and experienced no problem buying a ticket to my destination. I had to use the last of my available funds to buy this ticket, but at least I'll be safe in the knowledge that I might actually get to my destination when I expect to.

### "never received my refund"
Truly terrible customer service. Flight was changed and never received my refund. Called up and spoke to someone after being on hold and said the refund was due. It's been a month without receiving my refund and have been on hold multiple hours trying to fix this. Don't save money on cheap flights, not worth it if it goes wrong.

### "Can't really say anything bad"
The A321neo was fully booked, I got an emergency exit row seat, cabin crew was professional and very cordial, the aircraft was well cleaned and new. Can't really say anything bad this time.

### "rebooked me on a flight a whole week later"
I booked an intercontinental flight weeks in advance, from Chicago to Brussels. It was an insanely expensive flight, but I bought it so I could spend time with my wife, which has been scarce recently. Everything was fine until a few hours before I was initially supposed to take off. They emailed me saying that there have been some changes to my itinerary. I have gotten these messages from airlines before and they usually change the departure time by 5-10 minutes, no big deal. Well TAP informed me that they cancelled my original flight, and rebooked me on a flight a whole week later! No explanation, nothing. Just a nice informational email. Oh, they were kind enough to mention that if I take my initial flight a week later, I will miss my connecting flight from the week before. Good eye. This new flight obviously does not work for me, or my wife who started crying. I requested a cancellation and went to look for a new flight with a different airline. The cancellation went super smooth. The refund not so much. I read their terms and conditions which state that they have to refund me the whole amount. Now all I can get is a voucher for TAP Airlines, which I absolutely do not want! Good to know that during this whole time, I have not been able to get through to customer service: office in Europe, office in USA, messenger, nothing. I called for hours - nobody picked up. Or when I think I got through to someone, they hang up on me without saying a word! Not even an acknowledgment that they exist.

### "Terrible luggage management!"
Terrible luggage management!! I flew from Hamburg to San Francisco on July 11, 2021 with TAP Portugal. The flight was great! But when arriving at San Francisco airport, my luggage was not there. I could not find any TAP Portugal representative to know more about my luggage and had to spend about an hour at the luggage customer service. There they told me that my luggage would not arrive and that they could not locate it. After multiple phone calls on the next day and day after, they finally told me that my baggage was still in Hamburg and was never put on the flight with me (even though I checked in the luggage 2h before the flight). This was the beginning of a nightmare because they could not send me my luggage in San Francisco before the following Thursday, however I had to fly to NYC on this Thursday for business. Instead of directly sending my luggage to NYC, TAP Portugal decided on sending the luggage to San Francisco before sending to NYC. Unfortunately, the airline has mixed up the baggage and sent mine to Sacramento! They now plan on sending my luggage to San Francisco first and then NYC today (6 days after my flight). I definitely don’t recommend this airline because of the luggage management! I have called over 15 times with them, told my story every time again, trying to get my luggage back! The most critical is that I will start working for a luxury company next Monday and do not have any professional outfit (since I had everything in my baggage)!! I do not have any toiletries with me either! I have asked TAP Portugal how much I could spend to buy new outfit and toiletries, they told me they could not find a limit, and they could not find how much I will be reimbursed! Honestly disappointed and hopping for the best to get my luggage tonight.

### "I will not be using TAP again"
I will not be using TAP again. The experience started in the airport at Ponta Delgada in the Azores. After having carefully read all the requirements enforced by the UK government and having subjected myself to the test and outrageous fees required by same, I arrived at the counter for my flight where are the check-in staff argued with me for 25 minutes about whether I had the correct documentation as required by the UK for reentry. Eventually, after I pointed out multiple times what the current guidance from the UK is is and show them all the receipts I had including a bank statement, I was giving my boarding pass. As I am unable to climb stairs and I had requested handicap assistance for the flights. The route was from Ponta Delgada to Oporto, where I had reserved a hotel room for the rather long layover between both segments of the flight. My wheelchair attendant in Ponta delgada was wonderful and was the highlight of the trip. Once on board, the fun ended. The first segment was being flown by an A320neo with less legroom than either Ryanair or Wizzair, but at thrice the price. Add to the outrageous price the fact that there was no catering on board except items to buy at very high prices which was indeed disappointing. The cabin staff was very friendly on both segments and very attentive. However, the leg room was so tight and the seats were the new thin non reclining type. I mistakenly assumed that this was part of the a320neo kitting of the cabin, and hope that the flight from Porto to London Gatwick would be better. After a restful night at a hotel near the airport I arrived well ahead of my flight as sometimes when you request wheelchair assistance it takes a lot longer to be seen to. After checking in - this time without an argument from the desk - I was told where to wait for assistance. In due time young woman showed up with a wheelchair, talk me through security to passport control which was unstaffed at that time. There she rather unceremoniously dumped me and said she would be back in time for my flight to take me aboard the aircraft. She never returned. Wheelchair bound and unable to move easily, I was a captive of TAP Portugal and Porto airport. Boarding time came and went as I grew more and more nervous. Finally, 10 minutes after the gate was supposed to close, a man from the wheelchair assistance program often puffed up to me and apologised profusely as apparently I had just been forgotten somehow. He then explained that the flight had been delayed buy 25 minutes for unknown reasons and that I would still make the plane as he pushed me through the airport at breakneck speeds. I thanked him for his trouble and made the flight back on time. Much to my dismay, the A320 - this time not a neo - had exactly the same, torture seating as did the previous plane. Joy! Another 2 hours and 15 minutes of sheer bliss. Again, cabin personnel was excellent which was not hard to be, as the flight was only half full.

### "I did not receive anything for my money"
I booked my ticket back in February 2020, for a September flight. They kept changing the flight and the times they were giving were not good for me, I had to be there by a certain date due to an engagement I had there at my final destination. Unfortunately Covid hit and I was not able to travel out of the country. They credited me but only partially as they claim the ticket was non refundable, this cancellation was not my fault and I should have gotten a full credit. I also paid for my luggage for both ways at $85 each, when I spoke to them they also told me the luggage going was not cancelled in enough time and I could not get my money back, but they would give me my money back for my luggage coming back. Today is July 2021 and I have not received it, every time I contact they tell me I’m going to get it but there are a lot of requests. This airline is horrible, I could see if there was not a pandemic and I choose not to fly but this is not the case. I believe that they push you off like this figuring that you will stop and they keep your money and that’s the end. I did not receive anything for my money.

### "Gate was closed 1 hour prior to departure"
Not Verified |  Gate was closed 1 hour prior to departure. When we arrived at the Gate during "Last Call", the Gate was already closed. We were checked in with our luggage and everything. There was no call, nothing. When I indicated that there is still "Last Call" on the information the employees on the gate pressed a button and then it changed to "Gate Closed". We needed to wait 10 hours at the airport, book a new flight and pay it by our own. TAP did not react to any complaints. I would not suggest to use this airline.

### "They canceled our flights multiple times"
I bought our tickets in advance, before covid. They canceled our flights multiple times. I asked for a refund instead of voucher, but my case is still in process. TAP is unfair, unreliable. Never buy a TAP flight ticket.

### "credit expired in January 2021"
I had to cancel my trip due to Covid-19. It was a non-refundable ticket but when I cancelled I was informed that credit would be extended because of the circumstances. However I had no specifics regarding the deadline. Once travel was possible again, I learned that my credit expired in January 2021, which was before travel was even possible again. Customer service has been extremely unhelpful and confusing. They refuse to give me any consideration and I am out the full fare. I would never use this airline in the future. Extending credit as a “courtesy” during Covid but not giving reasonable time to use it is an empty gesture.

### "can’t believe the level of stupidity"
Horrible experience coming back to the states. I did one stop in Porto before coming back. They lady at the gate reception wouldn’t let me go through at first because I had a PCR Covid test printed in French. This is unbelievable, I just had the test done and it was clear negative in it. She then proceeded to send me over to the airports Covid testing (which had a huge line) if I had that done there I would’ve surely missed the flight. All of these unnecessary because I actually was never told that I had to print the result in English. Luckily I had the France ministry of health email still and I was able to download the official copy of my test result in both French and English. After that they let me through I just can’t believe the level of stupidity in this airline.

### "we want the refund"
Moved our flight for one whole day. No way to contact them. No refund. Money down the drain. My girlfriend and I booked our tickets together. After TAP changed our flight I called multiple times and contacted them via Facebook. We never got any response. They are unreachable through any means which they provide but they have someone who replies to public negative reviews so that it appears like they have a customer service. Don’t be fooled by this, it is only a poor attempt at advertising and improving their image. We don’t want status updates, we don’t want vouchers, we want the refund.

### "legroom is extremely unreasonable"
I thought TAP would resume its onboard service but I am starting to think they may not which in my opinion goes against what the market would more appreciate now from a proclaimed flag carrier and not one more operating low cost. Their legroom is extremely unreasonable and a disrespect for the dignity of its customers. But in their more comfortable and silent A321Neos you may find some really good seats even in economy. Flights attendants try their best but know they are working for a disoriented company. They use A319s on a Friday night when there is a huge demand for tickets and A321s in Monday morning when there is much less so. As you may be aware by now don't expect anything from them if you need assistance with your booking, the regulatory entity in Portugal seems dormant.

### "Abysmal and rude customer service"
Not Verified |  Abysmal and rude customer service. Long wait times, mistake after mistake. Do not expect any help from this airline. Anything goes wrong, you will be on your own. Avoid at all cost.

### "The seats are terrible"
The seats are terrible for a 3 hrs 15mins flight, from Munich to Lisbon. First row it so tigh, that when you try to open the table to eat, you almost cannot. It´s like bullying against stronger people. Purser was nice, but the others two crew members  seems they were in a fashion show instead in a plane. They look so cocky and non professional. Food was ok as also the drinks. But TAP  using these airplanes it´s terrible for passengers and I believe for crew members also.

### "they were extremely unaccommodating"
Not Verified |  Worst airline of all time. They rescheduled our flights days apart even though we had layovers, will not answer calls or emails no matter how many times you try, and we had a cancelled flight and they did not tell us at all and didn't reschedule it. Didn't answer any of our calls or emails. We had to fly for an extra 24 hours and spend the night in the airport because they were extremely unaccommodating and put everything off on other airlines when it was their responsibility and their flight.

### "I was not allowed on board"
During the boarding from Lisbon to Munich the COVID test from a certified laboratory, was not accepted and I was not allowed on board. I had to take another test at the airport and then buy a new ticket. On the flight from Munich to Lisbon I ordered coffee on board - I was given hot water and powder. Absolutely disgusting. I don't understand how they can afford to sell this.

### "Such a bad experience"
Not Verified |  Such a bad experience. My 16 years old went to Cape Verde from Boston via Lisbon. Did the check in here in Boston direct to CV and paid an extra $200.00 because the counter attendant said the luggage was heavy. I paid! Asked 2 times if the luggage checked to Cape Verde, he answer yes. At Lisbon my son were crying at airport because they charged him another $150 for the small carryon he had. He got Dollar only, they did not accept it, did not accept the credit card because he was underage. 10mn before close the gate another passenger felt sorry about him and gave him money to pay and he gave the person $200. They decided to left an underage passenger lost the flight when I asked twice in Boston if I should checked the carryon. It’s all about money…is the way the coin to double charge people - no respect for the passengers. My son will return with TAP because we bought both way ticket, but will be the last time - complete horrible my experience as a parents on the other side listening my Son trying to convince the attended to help him so he don’t missing his flight. Never ever again.

### "vouchers only good for a year"
Not Verified |  Booked my flight from Paris to San Francisco on November 2019 for June 2020. They canceled our flight due to COVID. They issued us the vouchers only good for a year. Since beginning of this year, I have been emailing them asking for an extension due to travel restrictions. I only got 1 email from them in February saying they are working on it due to high volume. I emailed them multiple times but no reply. Trying to call them but no one answer or the line is disconnected. I’m very tempted to purchase a international plan on my phone so I can make a international calls and hoping someone from TAP can help me. I’m so frustrated but did not want to lose $1500 we paid for our flights.

### "Very poor customer service"
Very poor customer service when it comes to issuing refunds, as cannot provide a timeframe for when the refund will be processed. This has forced me to initiate either the section 75 or chargeback scheme via my bank. Would not recommend!

### "This is appalling customer service"
I have been waiting for a refund for flights that they cancelled since February, almost 4 months now. Every time I call their customer service, I spend at least an hour on hold and am then told "yes, I can see it, it is being processed", for 4 months for a flight they cancelled! This is appalling customer service and surely they are in breach of all sorts of EU consumer legislation for failing to provide a full refund for services that they failed to provide in a reasonable time.

### "customer service is a total disgrace"
The neo type aircrafts are way more comfortable and silent than the now smaller part of the fleet. Still their product is in no way better comparing with European low cost companies particularly their customer service which is a total disgrace and not even barely complies with European law. The fact that it keeps getting away with it puzzles me.

### "customer support is not replying to us"
In February 2020 (before COVID-19 in EU), my partner and I were flying in one evening from Munich - Lisbon (stop over changing flight) and onto Faro. Our flight has been delayed in Munich 3h02, we had to stay over night in Lisbon to catch the next morning our flight to Faro. We have advanced expenses for Taxi and Hotel in Lisbon + our trip was delaying our whole week end schedule. By European Law we are entitled to compensation / refund of our expenses. We created our complaint on their website in Feb 2020, in Sept 2020 we have received an email with different offers where we chose the monetary compensation instead of X amounts of vouchers valid 1 year (that you cannot really use because of COVID-19). Today, we have no information, I keep calling and it is always the same replies, nothing is happening, completely useless! Their customer support is not replying to us per email. This is completely unbelievable and so unprofessional. I would not recommend TAP Portugal for their customer support.

### "This airline is not ethical"
Our flight was changed so they offered us a refund on July 21, 2021. We have been waiting ever since. Their Facebook page is filled with complaints of being granted a refund but never receiving the money. This airline is not ethical or legitimate in its dealings with customers. Don't fly with them under any circumstances.

### "they refuse to refund me"
I would have loved to describe my experience during the flight but unfortunately it was cancelled by TAP a few days prior to d-day (sometime in August 2020). They put forward the COVID-19 situation as a reason but since, and despite my repeated requests, they refuse to refund me. The ticket was purchased through their partner in crime GOTOGATE and as of now, nearly a year later, I am trapped between two criminal entities refusing to pay back my hard-earned money (whatever small). They blamed each other for the delays and COVID for the cancellation. COVID is affecting everyone but these unscrupulous criminal groups (not respectful companies) are taking advantage of the situation to rip us all off in bright daylight and with complete impunity. They probably think they might get away with it once the customers are tired of asking for their rights. Something should be done at this point by the regulators to curb down this disrespectful and unlawful behaviours.

### "Avoid at all costs"
This is a TAP review of a flight that did not happen. I was ticketed VCP-LIS on one ticket and LIS-BCN on a separate ticket. The overseas flight from Brasil was cancelled due to government imposed travel restrictions and the LIS-BCN leg had to be cancelled separately. TAP was unable to determine on the phone how much of a voucher would remain after their' fees' but said I would receive the voucher shortly. Now more than a month after the cancellation I have received no voucher and they have not responded to email queries about the status. This is a dysfunctional airline. I've had flight cancellations on both British Airways and Iberia in the past few months. In the case of BA my refund was processed immediately and received by my bank within a week. In the case of Iberia I had the voucher in my email within minutes of cancellation. TAP operates a poor business, in effect as a third world airline. In addition to being absolutely dreadful administratively, their Lisbon operations are disgraceful, the Lisbon airport one of the worst in the world and TAP does nothing to help business class carriers or disabled people through massive immigration queues. Lounges are third rate and filthy. There's a reason this airline is cheap. You get what you pay for. Avoid at all costs. Don't be tempted by their cheap fares. You are only looking for trouble.

### "absolutely no helpful support at all"
Absolutely the worst airline I have ever dealt with. It's an absolute joke they are able to retain the title of an accredited airline. Please stay away at all costs. I am on the tail end of getting kicked off a flight, luggage lost, 4 hours on hold, 3 hours in a "customer service" line up with a phone line that has told me that they are unable to track luggage and my best bet is to fill out an airport form. 1 hr between connecting between each department on the phone (and they have plenty) with absolutely no helpful support at all. A truly shocking experience if possible avoid at all costs.

### "TAP kept changing the flights"
Not Verified |  We booked our trip in advance, but TAP kept changing the flights, first they changed the way there flight to a different day, then 2 weeks later they changed the returned flight, then again they changed the return flight again. Completely crazy, no one answers the telephone and they take very long to reply to emails.

### "blamed me for trying to rebook late"
I tried to rebook my family flight before the departure by calling TAP. Nobody was answering. I tried to do it through their website - not working, showing error messages after every attempt. Finally after 1,5h I managed to contact the company. 1000 EUR additional costs - I was lied by the consultant about fare difference price which was bigger comparing to the offer available at their website. I hang up to see if I can afford it and decided to call them back and rebook. This time it was already 1300 EUR because they added no-show fee. All of this after they were not picking up the phone and website was not working. No show? They blamed me for trying to rebook late (I have a full right to do it!). They didn't take any responsibility for the website which is not working. Blamed me for it! One of the passengers was denied boarding so they said that this is a reason why they counted is as no show. So why they wanted to charge all passengers no-show fees? They didn't know and couldn't recall specific regulation for this in fare rules. I thought - ok, I really need this flight to happen. Even if I got cheated I decided to pay and later sort this out in the court. After another hours of calling (over 6h total!) they closed customer service phoneline. In meantime they hanged up twice. Next day I called at 8am. The price was 1700 EUR already, What's more the consultant told me that only the first offer didn't include the no-show fees and after I rejected it the next ones had to include it. I never rejected the offer - I needed to check if I can afford it. I was also not told that if I hang up I'll have to pay more. Never trust TAP, based on my experience they can lie and make your TAP experience really unforgettable. I have no words! Try to explain 4 year old that his dream holidays are not going to happen.

### "Stay away if you can"
Their cabin crew lacks a minimum of empathy towards passengers. I saw a flight attendant ignoring an older lady who was asking for help to store her baggage in the overhead compartments. Then the same flight attendant approached a little child who was screaming at the top of his lungs as if he was an adult, which is quite absurd. No sympathy, gentleness or friendliness. The chef of cabin was better at her job but still couldn't be bother much. I know that air travelling nowadays is not only stressful but also as bad as travelling by bus, but still, there's a minimum of costumer care which should be respected and when it doesn't it tells a lot about the company. Legroom is worse than other low costs and makes the journey uncomfortable for anyone of a medium height. They downgraded their scheduled aircraft from an A321neo to A320neo due to the low turnout, which packed the A320neo, something you don't want in a pandemic. Cleanliness needs to be upgraded. All in all, mediocre as usual. Stay away if you can.

### "sent me a couple of useless vouchers"
Not Verified |  Booked our flights in Dec 2020. In Feb 2021 TAP cancelled our outbound flights. I requested a refund but instead TAP sent me a couple of useless vouchers! I have repeatedly requested my money back and been ignored. Finally TAP responded to my complaints via Twitter and asked for specific details via DM. I responded through DM .and a week later still crickets. Terrible service from what was at one time a pretty good airline. Now they just take your money but don't deliver what you paid for. The only reason I rated them as 1/10 is because the website won't let me rate them as 0/10 Pretty hard to ever consider booking with them again until I have been fully refunded and compensated for the rubbish treatment.

### "No response whatsoever"
TAP Air Portugal cancelled flights for last summer and a refund was requested. It's been almost an entire year and they still have not provided a refund. I've sent the request to the email address they require 4 times and I've filed a complaint on their website. No response whatsoever. Also, when I check the complaint status - it says "complete", yet no one sent an email or responded. When I call they say they can't help and that I can only email that same email address that no one ever responds to. I will never book them again and I will tell everyone I know never to trust booking tickets with them.

### "only minor differences from a low cost"
A321neo almost empty on this early Saturday flight, a senior male crew was rather grumpy, more interested in chatting with his colleague than doing his job. He told a passenger to seat wherever he wanted and gesticulated on disembarking for people to hurry up. Their product has now only minor differences from a low cost airline.

### "TAP has not refunded me 34 euros"
I bought a trip to the Maldives on Swiss air that had Swiss, Lufthansa flights and the flight from Lisbon to Zurich operated by TAP. The trip had to be canceled due to the cancellation of one of the flights and I had to request a refund from Swiss, Lufthansa and TAP. Swiss in 2 weeks reimbursed me for more than 2000 euros. Lufthansa reimbursed me in 2 weeks for the amount of 150 euros for paying special seats and 2 months have passed and TAP has not refunded me 34 euros for paying 2 seats. I called them and they told me that the refund had been approved but that there are no predictions as to when the payment will be made.

### "I have not been refunded"
Like many here, I have not been refunded. I made the request on the web page more than a month ago, I had a simple response that it would be processed, and since then nothing more. I have written more than 10 emails, by private message on Facebook, on instagram, nothing. A very bad experience with this airline. They put up false advertising, saying that they refund, and it is lies. In the time of Covid, it is important to be flexible, quick and above all honest. Due to high number of messages" this is not an excuse, and as clients it is not our problem, or what we need, we just need you give it our money for what we paid you and we didn't consume the service, it is not complicated, it is just that you want to keep it for you.

### "they have yet to refund my tickets"
Not Verified |  Long story short: I purchased two tickets in Jan 2020 to depart in June 2020. TAP cancelled the flight service due to COVID. Okay, I get it, but they have yet to refund my tickets valued at over $1,000USD. They tried to give me a voucher for $48, then they tried to give me a voucher for the cost of the flight plus 20% for the in convenience. Finally I was able to request a monetary refund back to my method of payment. This was 6 months ago now and after contacting them multiple times to check on the status of my refund, they have no update for me. I’m not in the business of giving the airline an interest free loan of my money. There is no reason a refund shouldn’t have be processed by now, over a year after the purchase date and nearly a year from the cancellation. I paid for a service. They didn’t provide the service, and they still kept my money.

### "offers a time limited voucher not a refund"
1 week before we were due to fly I received a cancellation notice by email for all three of our tickets - due to covid. No option to rebook. There was a link to click on to request a reimbursement so I clicked on it. However, the on line website only offers a time limited voucher not a refund! There is no option to request that they refund your money and no incentive to take a voucher. So I called customer services - the process took just under one hour. A very long hold and then when I got through to someone they kept putting me on hold for about 5 mins - asking if i was still there, saying they were doing it the back on hold again. I was given 3 refund reference numbers and tiod I would receive an email and my source of payment would be credited (Paypal). 24 hours later nothing received so dreading calling back to query as I know it will be another wasted hour. Surely if the airline cancels your flight they should provide the online option to request a full refund and not try to scam you into accepting a time limited voucher.

### "not a total of what we paid"
On 03/03/2021, I bought two airline tickets from New York (USA) to Lisbon (Portugal) from the airline TAP (Transportes Aéreos Portugueses), and my credit card (payment finalized) was charged, with electronic tickets received and confirmed. On 05/03/2021, I received an email informing me of the cancellation of my tickets, reservation, and the reimbursement of the amounts due to TAP's operational error. After a big headache to schedule all of our trip, hotels, European domestic tickets, we received after 2 days from our reservation the air flight ticket was canceled from TAP. TAP demonstrated a total lack of respect and their failure to comply with their obligations in their service and the agreed price and dishonor with the commercial agreement. Today 03/16/2021, we received part of the reimbursement, only $273.80. This is not a total of what we paid. You are failing of reimbursing us for the correct payment. We paid a total of $443.80 and don't only $273.80, there are missing $170.00.

### "will never book with them again"
Not Verified |  Do not book tickets with this unreliable airline. I had tickets booked for jan 2022. They canceled my flight and didn’t even let me know! I only found out when trying to make my seat reservation. Still waiting for my refund! I will never book with them again.

### "they have requested 5 changes on the trip"
Not Verified |  I made reservations on 9/12/2020 for a flight on May 30 2021. One of the first tickets sold on the plane. So far they have requested 5 changes on the trip and currently have my connecting flight from Lisbon to Rome leaving 4 hours before I get there. After many calls, on hold for up to a half hour, I am told they can't do anything and I have to go through my agent to make changes. But, they were the ones who requested the changes. Why would you need to change a flight that was booked so early and I paid to have confirmed seats on the first leg of the trip.

### "I am still waiting for my £500 refund"
Booked a flight in the very beginning of 2020 to go in September. In August with the travel restrictions we decided not to go, so called TAP and because our flights had been changed hours by many hours, we were entitled to a refund. We preferred the refund as we didn't know when it would be safe to go again. Since August and after many many many calls to their Portuguese number, as the English one was always turning down the calls, I am still waiting for my £500 refund. All the calls are answered after 20 mins waiting, asked the reference number, asked to wait a minute to check what's going on, told they sent an email so the refund is processed ASAP and then told it's a matter of waiting a few more weeks!

### "I am still waiting for an answer"
The flights themselves were on time, cabin crew generally attentive and professional but the legroom was specially tight resulting in a very uncomfortable journey. They are now using their most recent aircraft which seemed clean to a high standard but as most airlines TAP uses the pandemic excuse to not serve any free catering on board to its passengers, the paid options were rather unexciting though not aggressively sold. The lounge in Lisbon is at this point forever closed. The most problematic issue you'll have with this airline is if you need to use their customer service, almost always you will made to feel like a nuisance, it's very difficult to reach them, their response is most times not adequate and even their compliance with consumers' rights are very questionable. I am still waiting for an answer regarding my parents December 2019 cancelled flights even before the pandemic began at all.

### "Very disappointed by this airline"
Very disappointed by this airline. Booked my flight when everything was still normal in december 2020. In July I received a message from TAP Portugal that my flight was canceled due to Covid19. Then i directly tried to reach out to TAP Portugal in order to receive a refund. (I rather not get a voucher only valid for 1 year, because I don't see my self traveling abroad the coming year due to the Covid19 situation.) It was very difficult to contact them in the first place. i found out that Facebook chat was the only way to speak to someone, but most of the times they don't even answer. TAP Portugal keeps on informing me that they are busy with is, and can not even inform me before which date I will get my money back. This would have help me getting assured just a little bit. I understand it is a crazy busy situation, but 9 months waiting and still nothing is unacceptable and does not make any sense. Other airlines arrange the vouchers or refunds in max. 1 month without issues. So unfortunately because of this I would strongly discourage other in order not to book via TAP Portugal. I feel sorry for all the people waiting for their vouchers or refund just like I am for almost a year.

### "the agent was not helpful"
Not Verified |  TAP has to be one of the most horrible airlines and no wonder their reviews are horrible as well. My aunt was scheduled to come to America from Portugal but had to switch her flight in November 2020 and March 2021 due to United States borders only being open for citizens and aliens. My aunt was charged about 300 each time the flight was changed which is ludicrous. I contacted TAP and questioned about the charge since there isn’t a way for her to visit US and the agent was not helpful and when asked to speak with a supervisor he said there’s no way that can be done!

### "This is honestly a joke of an airline"
Not Verified |  I had scheduled a flight to Manchester, UK in December 2020 for the beginning of January for business. Little did I know the country went into full lockdown in January 4th, preventing me (as a US citizen) to enter the country. I called the airline multiple times to try and refund or at least reschedule the flight date to when I could physically be allowed to enter the country at no success. When I asked to speak to a manager I was told “sorry but that is against policy.” This is honestly a joke of an airline and I nor my family or even extended family will ever fly with them, that I will make sure of. Maybe their customer service will improve over the years but who knows!

### "Seems like TAP Portugal is totally dishonest"
Not Verified |  I don't recommend TAP Air Portugal. We booked our summer holiday tickets MAN-SAL via Lisbon. Website  was easy and pretty straightforward to use, payment etc. hassle free. Problems started once our flight has been cancelled because of COVID. Till today we have no any contact with the company Tap Portugal. We have sent several emails with refund request, made phone calls, we asked European Customer Centre in UK for help. Seems like TAP Portugal is totally dishonest. Our tickets were booked for July 2020, right now is Feb 21. TAP Portugal is national airline of Portugal ... but is far far away from true!

### "Customer service is terrible"
I flew from Sao Paulo via Lisbon to Hamburg. During the flight Ialready did not feel save because nobody bothered to direct people to ut their masks back on. On the way I missed my flight to Hamburg because the gate closed very early in Lisbon. Then I had to go to the lobby where there was a huge queue of people who were all super mad at TAP. The first contact wanted to take 500 euros from me for rebooking on another flight. Then the second person just moved my details to a flight the next day without my consent and tried to force me to pay 250 euros. Meanwhile, another dissatisfied customer of Tap came to me and told me that there is a FREE rebooking in another office. Then I went over there to make it, however the second contact still wanted to force me to pay the money. She threatened me to cancel my trip including my return flight to Brazil without giving me any money back. Unfortunately, she succeeded in doing so because she had already verified my data for the other flight and I would have lost everything if I had not paid 250 Euros cash. They completely exploited my desperate situation as a young girl stuck in the airport durign Covid. Any complaint is not taken seriously because it is already a past flight. You can't reach anyone there anyway. It is really cruel. Customer service is terrible.

### "Won't be using TAP Portugal again"
Not Verified |  As a Portuguese citizen I am embarrassed to say this is our national airline. Applied for unused tickets under the terms and conditions on the 12th January but something went wrong. Got in touch with customer care and got a reply 6 full days later, got in touch via phone to try and speed up the process and the refund request was made with a 48 hours timeline given by he operator to have the vouchers available. Now almost 1 month later and many, many calls later was told that refunds are made between 30 to 90 days after the request. Asked for a refund on the method of payment and was told it will take even longer and either wait and shut it or wait and shut it. This is not a low cost airline and they should not treat customers like this. Won't be using TAP Portugal again. Onboard food and beverage is at the same level as Ryanair (which is low cost) only the seats are better and that's it.

### "business class was full"
Check-in in business class at GRU Airport was quick, the attendant asks for proof of the RT-PCR test with a negative result for COVID-19. ￼￼ Economy class and business class boarding are done through the same gate, business class passengers boards first. The business class was full. The lavatories / toilets located at the front of the plane are forbidden to passengers, they can only be used by the crew. The TAP business class on this A330/900 aircraft has a 1-2-1 configuration. There were 3 hot options for dinner: a pasta, a fish and chicken. Starter and dessert are the same, regardless of the hot dish option. The armchair reclines completely, but the space available for the legs tapers from the knee down ￼ (I am 1.82 m, so you can have a reference). There was no turbulence, or, if there was, it was very little. The landing was on time.

### "worst airline I have ever used"
Not Verified |  TAP is the worst airline I have ever used. My flight was cancelled two days in a row and I was stranded in Boston. They didn't tell anyone at the gate and when people started to find out there was stampede to get to the counters. I waited 5 hours in line on the first day and had to BEG them to put me up in a hotel with a voucher. On the second day, the same disastrous situation occurred. They had a daily scheduled flight on the same route, which departed on time, but our flight was told a new plane arrived and it was cancelled. They didn't tell us anything. TAP wouldn't give any information at all. I got a different hotel for the second night with a voucher. The hotel was more than $300 and they didn't accept my voucher and forced me to pay before I could leave. TAP took 6 months to give me a voucher to make up for the issue and I hassled them mercilessly. During this hassling, the incompetent TAP staff told me at times that I would get a refund for the flight. Then COVID-19 happened and I explained I couldn't use the voucher. They told me I could convert it to cash. And I called 100 times and 50% of the time I got different answers, I was told my refund was pending, I was told I could convert the voucher, etc. This process has been drawn out for over 18 months. I recently heard that I won't get anything from TAP. Their service on the eventual flight that I took to Lisbon was abysmal. Rude attendants and the operators on the phone are completely incompetent. The airline has no excuse for continuing to be in business. This airline is a disgrace and I was absolutely livid and appalled by their horrendous handling of my situation. Which they continue to blame on COVID, even though I flew originally in August of 2019 - 6 months before COVID.

### "Never buy from this company"
Never buy from this company. My trip was canceled 5 months ago and still nowadays when I call them they simply refuse to inform when I'll be reimbursed. Lost 1000 Euros for this.

### "Fit to Fly test out of date"
Denied boarding for having a Covid PCR "Fit to Fly" test out of date by 1 day (Test sample taken Saturday; no appointment on Sundays; flight on Wednesday- apparently out of 72 horus). Asked for refund and I was told to speak to the booking agency. No refund from booking agency (so I'll never deal with eDreams again either). Asked TAP at the desk about next available flights- I was told the transfer to the next flight would be about £210, otherwise to just get a new flight on a Tuesday. They neglected to mention a flight they had on a Saturday, for a cheaper price than the one on the Tuesday. Ended up flying RyanAir two days after being denied boarding to TAP; next thing I know, all flights to Portugal from the UK were closed shortly after my return. Dodged a bullet with TAP.

### "3 months later still waiting!"
Not Verified |  I had booked a flight on 19th October 2020 from AMS - LIS. The class I booked was TOP EXECUTIVE (Business Class) where the ticket is fully cancellable, changeable and refundable at all times. The flight timing was changed several times before the departure date. I cancelled my flight on the 18th of October 2020 and asked for a refund on the TAP website. We are now 3 months further and the status on their website for my refund is still the same and never changed in these 3 months (in process). I called their customer service every 3 weeks and send an email, but to no avail and always get the same answer that I will have to wait and no idea how long it can take. In my earlier calls I was told that it would take maximum 60 days, and now 3 months later still waiting! Very disappointed and surely not something I would consider flying again, ever!

### "audacity of this airline is quite unbelievable"
Not Verified |  The audacity of this airline is quite unbelievable! Before the pandemic began I booked a flight for the end of May through Expedia. Several days before the flight date I was informed that TAP Air had cancelled the flight, which I had been expecting. I was issued a voucher for an amount close to that which I had paid through Expedia. I a flight directly with TAP Air for the end of October, assuming that travel would be possible by that time. I had to pay an additional fee of over $200 to book with them for the same itinerary. When it became clear that American citizens would not be able to fly to EU countries for non-essential travel, I cancelled the flight in mid-September. TAP Air then issued me a voucher for $191, only a portion of the taxes for the flight. That was when the circus really began. The only time that there has been any communication has been when I phoned customer care. I was told to email their refund department, which I did and have never received an answer. I was informed by one agent that the refund department had stopped answering telephone calls from customers. I was told by another agent that the I was only receiving a portion of the tax because the flight had been "non-refundable". I have made it clear that I am not averse to flying the same itinerary when it becomes possible and that I expect to receive what I paid for from them. I am at my wits end. Being cheated by a company in this manner is a slap in the face. I don't know where to turn. Treating customers in this manner borders on criminal activity and certainly seems fraudulent.

### "Appalling, if not fraudulent, customer service"
Not Verified |  Appalling, if not fraudulent, customer service. Like other people have described here, I have spent hours on numerous support calls trying to get my refund for a too late cancelled flight in June. My letter which by European law has to be answered within two weeks has been ignored to date. On the phone they keep promising to deal with it “next week”, and nothing happens every single time. This seems like a deliberate scheme. I really do usually not wish with the worst for others, but with such poor customer service (I did deal with other airlines that handled this difficult situation much better and more professionally) over many months I do think maybe it is for the better if some airlines go out of business and get replaced by better competitors and services.

### "There were 3 hot options for dinner"
Check-in in business class was quick, the attendant asks for proof of the RT-PCR test with a negative result for COVID-19, as well as the residence / citizenship card in Portugal or European passport. ￼￼ And he warned us that we would have to present the negative test voucher again at the boarding gate. Economy class boarding is done through a gate and business class boarding is done through another gate, next to each other. We had to show again the negative test for COVID-19.￼ The business class was packed. The lavatories / toilets at the front of the plane are forbidden to passengers, they can only be used by the crew. The TAP business class on this A330/900 aircraft has a 1-2-1 configuration. There were 3 hot options for dinner: a pasta, a fish and chicken. Starter and dessert are the same, regardless of the hot dish option. The armchair reclines completely, but the space available for the legs tapers from the knee down ￼ (I am 1.82 m, so you can have a reference). There was no turbulence, or, if there was, it was very little. The landing was 40 minutes in advance! We hired a reception service at Lisbon airport. The attendant welcomes you at the door of the plane, gives you priority for the control of the negative test of COVID-19 as well as, also for priority, for passport control. Then accompany you to the conveyor belt, to collect luggage and, finally, to transport to the residence / hotel￼.

### "this is not an acceptable service"
I'm extremely disappointed with TAP. I booked with them because I trusted them but I was wrong. I had a flight booked with them from Porto to Heathrow, they decided to change it and do Porto-Lisbon-Heathrow. And then just before we get into the plane they decide that we needed to leave our hand luggage with them because the flight was full, I told them about my flight connection asked them if they could take priority in people that were doing connection and they just did not care and said that I couldn't take my bag with me and that my bag would go straight to London. I arrived in London but my bag and the bags from around fifteen more people that did the connection didn't arrive, this is not an acceptable service for a company like TAP. Very disappointed with the company, just hope that they actually find my bag and bring it without anything missing.

### "I will never fly TAP again"
Please read this and beware. Purchased economy tickets but due to covid restrictions was unable to travel. Ok it was only £350 for 2 tickets but their response was unbelievable. Hours in call queues, on 3 separate occasions received 3 different replies, customer care don't have a clue what the policies are and change depending on who you talk to. Basically my options were £50 refund, if you wait 3 month or flight change costing £100 each in charges. I will never fly TAP again.

### "Unjust and insulting refund"
Unjust and insulting refund of 15% of a ticket that was unusable due to worldwide pandemic. Contacted TAP in person, via mail, via Facebook, via Twitter, via Skype, via their website, repeatedly over the last many months, without a reply apart from standard texts. I received the same answer as via the various email communications of before (those that were answered), that I should have read the terms and conditions - something that is clearly and reasonably not applicable during a worldwide pandemic. Because of emergency COVID measures worldwide beyond my reasonable control I am unable to get a visa to travel from the USA to Europe. The refund offered was 80USD out of 570USD, 14 percent!

### "the worse customer experience"
Probably I faced the worse customer experience in the World. My flight has been cancelled, I got absolutly no notification, after doing the PCR test, for 100 euros, printing the boarding pass, paying 2 taxis, get to the airport to be told that my flight has been cancelled, I got absolutely no alternative no possibilities specially that i was doing a transit in Lisbon and the first flight has not been cancelled, it was the second one, I asked for a possibility to book another flight from Lisbon and nothing, and even worse I was told to call the customer service to ask for having my money back! I called the center and they gave me another number. I called the other number and got no response its always busy. I feel upset, disappointed and with no right as customer.

### TAP Portugal customer review
This airline made me miss my vacation to Paris twice and used covid-19 restriction as an excuse even though I had all valid documents to get on board. I was issued a third flight in replacement of my second purchased flight for December. This ticket was issued to me by the Manager of TAP AIR PORTUGAL at Dulles airport in Washington DC. Now in December, I am getting ready to fly and call them to make sure that I have all the necessary documents, the representative says that there is no flight schedule with my name. I have attached the forwarded copy of the ticket that was issued to me by the manager on site. But they are telling me to reach out to the travel agency when I had no transaction made with the travel agency for my December 24th flight. This company is the most professionally inept, employees are clueless and arrogant. This is my second vacation that I am now going to miss because of their lack of professionalism . Don't waste your time riding on with this airline, they are cheap but it comes at a vey high price!

### "do not follow moral business practices"
This airline changed my flight by several days, wouldn't let me cancel and receive a refund outright, and I have been waiting for my partial refund for over two months. Completely unacceptable, and borderline unlawful. Beware of giving any money to this airline as they clearly do not follow moral business practices and they see no problem with stealing people's money.

### "Waiting 3 months for my refund"
Waiting 3 months for my refund for flights that were cancelled by TAP. It was completely understandable that there was a delay in issuing refunds in March and April this year. However, we have all now been living with Covid for 9 months and one would image that the volume of airline refunds has very much diminished. Back in September, Tap cancelled my flights from Barcelona to Cancun due to depart in January 2021. I asked for a refund at that point instead of a voucher and was told it would be processed promptly. Long story short, after several follow ups, I'm still waiting. I was told on the call today that they had no information and to simply wait a little longer. When Covid is over I hope everyone remembers how bad Customer Service to TAP Portugal really is.

### "One of the most uncomfortable flights"
One of the most uncomfortable flights of my life. I have flown Ryanair, easyjet and other low cost airlines but I can never remember being quite so uncomfortable on any flight before. It's truly depressing that an airline would invest in new equipment and do such a bad job. I think it was not just the pitch but the design of the seats, seats are quite hard, very upright and really tight legroom. I could not get comfortable in any position, I am 1.86m which is tall but not huge, there were some passengers much taller than me, I cannot imagine what the 125 minutes were like for them. No free snack, not a complaint, its the norm I guess these days but still should be noted. Plane was new, well presented, staff we nice. Really everything was ok except I felt like i was being tortured in that seat. Its not fit for purpose and now would only consider flying TAP if I felt the cost of paying for an exit seat or comfort class seat was worth it. The flight was so uncomfortable that I would not have to reconsider flying with TAP long haul as I would know their short haul product is waiting for me in Lisbon. Simply awful.

### "Service is polite and efficient"
A journey that was a "game of two halves". This "half" was great, brand new A330, I flew it a few weeks ago in Business Class and was underwhelmed, for a business class fare I felt things could have been better, in economy however I felt the value of the fare (in this case paid with miles) made TAP a more attractive option. They are frequently the cheapest option too and from Brazil (to/from Europe) and really no substantial shortcomings compared to the opposition. Service is polite and efficient, food is ok, nothing special a bit meagre but not noticeably different to the more expensive competition, the aircraft is great, seat reasonably comfortable at least as comfortable as KLM/AF who I normally use, entertainment, same, I couldn't get connected to wifi but i think i needed an app on my phone so my fault...Its the shortest hop across from Brazil to Europe which is also a plus. All in all a very decent economy product, I will leave a report about my experience in the "second half" flight from Lisbon to London which was completely different and simply awful, but long haul in Economy TAP does a good job!

### "Crew and service are way below par"
Friends warned us about the service and product offered by TAP. We chose to fly them out of last resort - which would be my advice too. Crew and service are way below par in business class. FA's clearly don't like their jobs and the food was best described as gruel. They looked puzzled at why they were clearing my tray full of food. Drink selection is on par with Azore Airlines (formely SATA). Gin, Scotch, red & white wine, who is running this class of service on a legacy carrier ? The new A321 Neo has a tight business class seat which is sad considering this one of their newest aircraft. I hate the shoulder belts that they make you connect while taking off & landing - they don't have belt tensioners which make them too tight on your shoulder. Flying a single aisle aircraft across the pond for 8 hours isn't the best choice but during Covid I can see why they chose this - 67 people in economy and 4 in business class. While the airlines are choosing these more now than ever they are a bumpy ride for a long time and best avoided. You would think that 4 cabin crew could have been more attentive to the business traveller but they were more interested in chatting in forward galley with very minimal walk thru to see if we needed anything - all in all, there are better out there, and if you aren't forced due to routing or last efforts I'd say choose someone else.

### "I had no covid-19 test"
I was denied access on tuesday to enter the flight because I had no covid-19 test. The woman at the counter told me to bring one less than 15 days. Which i brought on Thursday for my new flight. They then denied me again for not having a covid19 test less than 72 hours before departure. They then refuse any change on my flight for less then $500 extra fees, and advice me to take a new one for $300.

### "you will be offered a voucher"
Absolutely Terrible. They are going against all European law and worst of all I can not imagine they are being allowed to. I hope they are made to pay all the passengers to whom they just sent travel vouchers to. They do not answer their phones, emails, or complaints. Avoid at all costs ever since COVID hit or you will be offered a voucher with a limited amount of time to use it on top of everything. During the pandemic with a mandatory quarantine, they offer a 1 year time period to use it.

### "Worst Customer Service I've experienced so far"
Not Verified |  
Worst Customer Service I've experienced so far. Super frustrating. Website is bugging, no transactions possible since the website crushed about 6 times in a row. We've been trying this for days now. It's impossible to reach someone of the customer service via phone, since they kick you out of the line after +1hr of waiting! This happened several times. Wanted to book extra baggage and seat reservations, just not possible. I can leave my money elsewhere. You would think the airlines are desperate for money in this pandemic. But they're lacking service staff instead of providing more, especially now needed jobs. Can't even tell how frustrating this experience is. Spending several hours trying to figure out how to contact someone because the website doesn't work. I wouldn't even reach someone if I wanted to cancel the whole flight.

### "heir customer service is horrible"
Not Verified |  My husband and I booked a trip to Portugal last October to go this past May for our one year wedding anniversary. TAP cancelled our flights without notifying us due to COVID-19, which we totally understood - though, being notified would have been nice. They issued us a refund voucher good for 2 years which doesn’t work for us as we don’t know if we will be able to go in the next 2 years (keep in mind a year of that time it is likely we won’t be able to travel due to COVID). We have asked for a refund of our almost $2,000 dollars that they have had for almost a year now. They still haven't refunded our money. Despite them telling us we would have our money in 2 months, it’s now been over 3 months and they just keep pushing us on to someone else. W will not be traveling TAP as their customer service is horrible! Please save yourself the headache and don’t book with TAP!

### "never again fly on TAP"
Not Verified |  My son bought a ticket to fly on TAP airlines to Germany on June 29, 2020. He bought the ticket around December 2019. The airline cancelled the flight due to the Covid 19 restrictions. He got a voucher. He rebooked for August 10. The flight was again cancelled and he got another voucher. He got a new ticket for September 7. But due to Germany imposed restrictions, it was clear he wasn’t going to be able to fly in that date, so he tried to cancel and did a refund request for another voucher. But the airline never responded. They did not respond to the request, they did not respond to his emails, and they never answered the phone when we called. He went online and send an email using a form TAP airlines has for customer service, and this is how they responded: “Please allow us to inform you that this department does not handle refunds.” The date went by and no word from the airline. These days of uncertainty, patience has to go both ways. If they cancel, we understand. But if we cancel, they look the other way? If they don’t refund him his money or give him another voucher, my family will never again fly on TAP. And we fly often.

### "happy that their prices dropped"
Excellent flight with TAP. I don't know if the pandemic affected their prices, but I am glad for once to see the tickets back to reasonable prices. TAP was becoming far too expensive and I rarely see any Portuguese flying with the airline. It is mostly used by foreigners connecting through Lisbon to other places in Europe. First time I travelled on an Airbus 330 neo and it was what a great plane it is. The flight was surprisingly half full with most people flying through Lisbon to other destinations in Europe. I haven't used TAP for a while but I did this time and was pleasantly surprised. Very good price and also very good service on board. Ordered a special meal free of charge and crew was attentive and pleasant. Plenty of leg room in economy and comfortable plane. I shall be using them in the Miami route and I am happy that their prices dropped. It was becoming a very expensive airline.

### "really cramped for a business class seat"
You get what you pay for. TAP generally offer the cheapest fares from São Paulo, I tend to avoid cheap when flying as it generally ends up being nasty. This was no exception. Despite the aircraft being very new I was wholly underwhelmed by the seat, felt really cramped for a business class seat. Fillet mignon was horribly overcooked and the accompanying sides dull. The port was nice. I have a chunk of TAP miles I will try to use them with Star alliance partners, it’s not terrible just not in any way at all good. Pay a bit more and enjoy with an alternative.

### "not even a glass of water served"
I am a Silver member and there's no lounge at Lisbon, not even a glass of water served onboard. The approach to Madeira airport was the worst I have ever experienced and I have flown this route more than thirty times. I don't think the pilot should have landed on those windy conditions. Everyone was relieved when it came to a stop. I don't even noticed the cabin crew the whole flight, at the end they were chatting with each other instead of saying goodbye and thank you.

### "not corona friendly experience"
This was definitely not corona friendly experience. The plane was not fully booked (which is a plus) but the management of the seats was a disaster. There were many people who were sitting alone in whole row and also at least 4 rows in the back fully empty. While we (a couple) who booked tickets together, had one more person sitting in our row, meaning no social distancing at all. So we had to go back leaving our luggage. Highly disappointing management in the middle of a pandemic.

### "Useless customer service"
Two weeks after booking my flight, TAP Portugal sent me an email saying they cancelled it and moved me on the same flight the day before instead. The problem is that it was a connecting flight and I couldn't take my other flights anymore. I tried to contact them by phone, Skype, email, Facebook and Twitter. Basically every option they offer but they never replied to anything. Useless customer service.

### "so disappointed and disgusted"
Worst customer service ever! I needed to rebook my flight, their website didn’t work so I had to call them - literally I spend 10h on the phone, they hung up on me so many times I can’t count. I will never fly again with this company. I used to like them but I am so disappointed and disgusted by the way they treat customers.

### "forced me to get a voucher"
The airline has cancelled my flight 3 times and forced me to get a voucher refund. Since it’s almost impossible to contact the customer service I agreed. Last time they said they would add 20% to the ticket price but in fact I received only half of the value of my reservation. It looks like they did not refund fees I paid for extra luggage, seat reservation and fast track. I was trying to call them but every time they hang up on me. No one replies to emails or online complains.

### "I don't recommend this company"
I got the message about cancelling the flight and proposition to request a refund. I completed this booking cancellation procedure at the site though I haven't seen the sum of the refund at the end of the cancellation procedure. But I assumed refund should be in full since TAP Portugal cancelled the flight. But I got the voucher for 10 times less sum without any explanations! I tried to contacted them by phone, skype, site, email, facebook, registered 3 complaints - not a single answer. I don't recommend this company.

### "Very frustrating experience"
Very frustrating experience overall, I will avoid using this airline in the future. Impossible to get response from their website, I tried calling to their skype, phone, writing in facebook, as well as filing official complaint in their website 2 days ago - still no response. Their website doesn't allow me to update my booking, though I tried several times - it gives various kinds of errors (for example error page when I pay for luggage, already did all operation and the last page should appear saying that all done - it just shows certain non-user friendly error; or sometimes I get pop up windows on their website with API error 500, and so on). Because of this I missed the chance to pay for the luggage 30 euro, and now have to pay 45 euro - and even that actually still doesn't work, in some new peculiar way. Both website and support are the worst airline experience in my life so far (I travel often, and I am work in software engineering - so I know typically how to accomplish simple operations on websites).

### "Customer service is null"
Not Verified | Customer service is null, price too expensive, the phone lines are dead, they only care till they got your money. After that good luck, spend hours trying to get someone to help you, and and then finally when you find someone to talk to you he won't help you because they won't do anything to give you a money back or to rebook the tickets nothing. They are purely interested in taking your money.

### "TAP has become a lowcost"
On the service point of view, TAP has become a lowcost. The flight was on time, cabin cleaning was acceptable, the crew satisfactory. However, the base prices are extremely expensive and you get nothing in return if you don’t pay extra. Unreasonable, and it is for a last resource airline.

### "aircraft was a bit dated"
The flight was slightly delayed from its original times, but announced days before. The aircraft was a bit dated, with no usb ports or extended trays, but the staff were very nice and attentive.

### "Staff really attentive"
Lisbon to Madrid. A very nice flight. Very few people (roughly 50% capacity). Staff were really attentive and made sure people were comfortable, even though no service was provided, given the circumstances. The aircraft was a bit old.

### "could only issue a voucher"
I was supposed to fly on 1 August from Lisbon to Sao Tome and back on 8 August. TAP Portugal had announced with great fanfare the resumption of flights to Sao Tome (STP Airways is already flying the route each Friday morning at 0600 am since early July). On 24 July I was informed by SMS that my return flight on 8 August was moved to 6 August. This not being acceptable, I was able to change this to a return on 13 August. On Thursday 30 July I traveled from Amsterdam to Lisbon (after having done my PCR test for entering Sao Tome) and upon arrival I received an email that for Corona-related reasons, my return flight on 13 August had been cancelled. In fact all flights to and from Sao Tome in August (other than my flight to Sao Tome on 1 August) had been cancelled. Finding this situation very strange, I contacted TAP by Phone (I have Gold FF status so a dedicated line where people pick up the phone) and asked for a conformation that the fight on 1 August was indeed going ahead because if not, I could still take the STP flight on the next morning. I was assured that the flight was still going ahead that it, as well as the return flight of 2 August, were still open for booking, so nothing to worry about. When I tried to check in on Thursday night through the TAP App, it mentioned that also my 1 August flight had been cancelled. I had not received a message by SMS or email. When I called, the cancellation was explained as a result of the fact that the Ghana borders are still closed for international travel (they have ben for months, and I do not believe that there had been any expectation recently that they would be opened any time soon). In fact, TAP Portugal had already cancelled the flight in the afternoon (before the time that I spoke to the person who told me that you could still book the flight). Due to the timing of this information, I was unable to take the STP Airways flight on Friday morning. What made the situation however even more surreal is that when I asked TAP to refund my ticket (which was around EUR 1100 and which I had partly paid with a voucher of around EUR 110 I had received in connection with another cancellation the rest being paid the credit card), they informed me that they could not refund the cash element and could only issue a voucher for the full amount of the ticket due to the applicable conditions. They are however unable to point out where in the conditions it says so. An interesting way of having the clients fund their business by selling tickets for non-existing flights for cash and then providing vouchers in return. A kind of ponzi scheme. They do of course also argue that the cancellation of the flights is COVID 19-related and has nothing to do with operational issues.

### "nothing happens in the end"
Not Verified | Purchased tickets for my aunts with my credit card, but I received an email that the booking will only be confirmed after validation, if no validation takes place the tickets will be automatically canceled. This validation could only be done in person at a TAP ticket counter. In addition to the credit card issue in the email, it said that one of the ticket issuance had failed. I was unable to take them to the airport and do the validation. So I immediately contacted TAP by phone to explain the situation and they assured me that I would get the full refund because the validation would not take place. The next day the amount was debited from my credit card. I immediately called TAP again and indicated that I did not go through the site to cancel these tickets, they then entered the cancellation for me. After I bought tickets through Tix, I called Tap again to explain the situation and proof that I had bought the tickets which were 54 euros more expensive than TAP. They assured me again that I would get a full refund. A few months later (huge delay by Corona) I get the message that I would have to pay 300 euros per ticket for cancellation, while that was not mentioned before, the tickets would be automatically canceled and TAP assured me that I would get everything back. I have been talking to them weekly since March 10 to get the remaining amount back, but it is not getting along. I get confirmation every time that I get it back, but nothing happens in the end. In the past few weeks, when I call they hang-up after 38 minutes, so it is no longer available by telephone.

### "not cooperating with customers"
Not Verified | Venice to Newark via Lisbon. This is the one airline in the world that is not cooperating with customers given the the COVID 19 Pandemic. They are sticking to their "no refunds policy" despite the unprecedented disruption. I booked this flight well before COVID19 existence and simply attempting to push the trip out till March next year. the costs will be >600 Euro or I can choose to cancel and get nothing back. The 3 other airlines I am working with have all given me the ability to rebook with ease. This was my 2nd and last experience with TAP.

### "Still fighting to get my money back"
Purchased the tickets December 2019. Airline now requires a Covid-19 test with the results not older than 72 hours. I called dozens of places and no test results are available with less than 8 days and even that, is not a guarantee. So due to the current situation I am unable to provide these tests at the point of boarding, still the company does not refund the money and only gives me 6 months to postpone the trip, which are not enough for me to reschedule. I called all available contact numbers in the net, and none answer the phone. Extremely disappointed. Can't believe a company of this size would work like this. Still fighting to get my money back.

### "there is no social distancing"
When we had to book the flights their website was not working properly because it was telling us that the booking was confirmed but no confirmation email was sent nor money was taken from our card. When we tried to call them it would take hours for them to answer and the hang up right away. When we finally made it to book the tickets when the server got back we received a mail 4 days before the flight that we were supposed to present a negative Covid-19 test that was taken in the 72 hours prior the flight (almost impossible to do). So it made our pre flight situation horrible, only for us to get to the airport and hear one of the desk guys telling a man in line next to us "your test was taken more than 72 hours ago so it shouldn't be ok but you gonna be fine don't worry they might just make you do another test when you land eventually". We finally make it on the Aircraft where there is no social distancing. So my girlfriend and I decide to go sit in the back where there were 7 rows empty and there was one of the steward  standing there that told us it was fine and started chatting with us. Literally a minute later the other steward comes towards us and starts yelling at the other guy asking him why we were sitting there in the back, and then turns to me and tells me that we have to move forward. When I tell him that that sounded pretty weird because there is always people sitting around the plane and that we weren't feeling comfortable with the situation due to cover-19 he told me "if you keep acting like this I am gonna go call the captain and you can go do your social distancing outside of the aircraft".

### "the worst customer service"
I booked a flight with TAP Air in mid-June, with departure date on July 9th from NYC. I booked it to finally be able to fly back to my home country, Italy, after being stranded in the US due to travelling restrictions for about 3 months. On July 6th, only 3 days before departure, TAP Air has a new rule and sends an email saying that those who do not have proof of a negative COVID-19 test, administered in the prior 72-hours, will not be allowed to board. As you can imagine, asking someone in New York not only to get a test so quickly, but also to have the results in time - with lab facilities experiencing extreme delays - is ridiculous. On the day of my flight, I am of course not allowed to board and am given zero empathy from the company, they just don't care that they gave me three days to get a test result in the one city in the United States that has been hit the hardest. I then have to spend the next day on the phone, as the wait time for their customer service is roughly 40mins to 1 hour, only to be told I can change my plane ticket by paying 300$ for the change of ticket. This is by far the worst customer service I have ever experienced. They put in place a rule after I bought my ticket, enforced it with no comprehension or logic behind it - they said they are aware of testing limitations in nyc but that's the rule regardless - and I was forced to pay a massive surcharge on top of the very expensive tickets I had purchased a month prior. I travel, or used to travel, quite frequently and this is by far the worse airline I have ever come across. Please do not book with them.

### "don't care about their customer"
Not Verified | I am extremely dissatisfied with the way TAP Portugal handled my refunds for cancelled flights. I contacted this airlines multiple times, submitted requests and complaints regarding my cancelled return flight from Boston to Madrid. It's not only very difficult to connect with them, but even after a long wait on the phone, and finally chatting with the customer service representative (who promised to send my refund in a month) It's two months and I still don't have my refund. They don't explain, don't reply, and don't care about their customer. Not sure if I want to fly with TAP AirPortugal in the future.

### "flight was almost empty"
Ponta Delgada to Lisbon. The flight was almost empty so I was able to rest with the help of the two following chairs. Ended sleeping almost all flight. The young cabin crew as usual are interactive and nice. Nothing served onboard except for tea, coffee or water.

### "helpful with rebooking us"
Alright, we booked before Covid-19, initial flights got cancelled, it was a bit of a hassle to get new flights but whenever we spoke to a representative things were fixed. There are some things that they could have done better, like email us that our flights were cancelled in the first place. Sure, but when we went to rebook our flights we called their headquarter phone number (which can improve a little also) and they were very helpful with rebooking us to new flights. Seriously I understand that many holidays and weddingtrips have been canceled but no-way you can take it out on the airline. They are to blame for the booking system (which probably dates from 1980) and they could have emailed us about the cancellation of our initial flights. But did we just forget that there is a pandemic going on? They're doing their best, they rebooked our flights and they saved our holiday. So not going to complain.

### "the worst I’ve ever experienced"
To be honest, I’ve never flown with TAP Air Portugal because my flight with them was canceled due to COVID, but I have spent over 3 hours on the phone/on hold with them so far, which roughly translates to half of a trans-Atlantic flight, I suppose. And I feel that this time we’ve spent together is enough to justify this negative review. The long and short of it is, when I bought my tickets with TAP Air Portugal, I opted to pay an extra ~$100 for a refundable flight, and—despite that, and after waiting a month and a half—I still have not received my money back from them. Even if you purchase a cancellable flight (again, for more money), canceling through the website only grants you a flight voucher (good for one year only). In order to request a cash refund, you need to call them (nowhere was this mentioned when I bought my ticket, by the way; I had to call them to figure out this nugget of information). The phone number listed for the airline in many places is no longer in service; there’s a different number you need to call. Each phone call requires 30-60 minutes of hold time. I’ve been randomly disconnected from these phone calls multiple times. Most damning, each time I call, I’ve been told contradictory information. When I called on May 2nd to cancel my flight and ask for a refund, I was told that my request was submitted. Awesome. When I called back on May 18th, wondering why I hadn’t received it yet, I was told (for the first time) that I should wait a month to expect my refund, so I would have it by June 2nd. Then, when I called after June 2nd, again wondering where my refund was, the rep I spoke to tried to inform me that I hadn’t requested the refund until the 18th (even though the previous rep had confirmed that I requested said refund on the 2nd). This new rep also told me that I should wait a month to a month and a half beyond May 18th for my refund. The one consistent across all the reps I’ve talked to is that they won’t lift a finger to provide me any extra information. I’ve requested email messages to confirm what we’ve discussed. I’ve requested reps’ extensions in case I get disconnected (see above). Nothing. Whenever I hang up with a rep, I have to rely on their word that the information they've provided me is accurate. And at this point, I have little faith in that. In short, their customer service is some of the worst I’ve ever experienced. I understand that COVID is probably making things difficult for them to provide refunds promptly. However, I would be much more understanding if the company were open and transparent with me, instead of using misinformation as a delay tactic. I also believe that there are probably a lot of individuals out there that need the value of their flight refund much more than TAP Air Portugal right now. I’d definitely recommend steering away from TAP Air Portugal if you might need to cancel or rebook.

### "uncharming and aggressively ironic"
Funchal to Lisbon. TAP now offers a semi-low cost service, offering tea and coffee and you buy a sandwich by 6 euros if you like being robbed. However they still sell their products with catering included. Cabin crew is lucklustre, uninspired, uncharming and aggressively ironic. The life jacked wasn't beneath my seat but on front of it. For 260 eur one way domestic route of one hour 20 minutes it's a sad service. Plane could be cleaner but I think they will use more the Embraer 190 to Funchal. Is excellent for the route and airport. Great legroom. Have in attention God forbid you have to contact them. They dissuade your attempts.

### "the airline is unresponsive"
After arrival in Cabo Verde our luggage was missing. No representative of the airline was present and I was never contacted by one, too. We were not provided any information about: (i) delivery date of the luggage; (ii) contact information; and (iii) refund options. We had to buy the most necessary items (clothes, etc.) on our own expense. On the return flight I tried to clarify the situation in Lisboa. After waiting 40 minutes in a cue, a highly unfriendly TAP representative informed me that all refund claims need to be made online. Without further information provided by the representative I finally found the necessary information online. After more than 3 months and repeated phone calls (average waiting period about 30 minutes) the status is still pending and the airline is unresponsive.

### "managed to deceive me"
Today I went to the TAP website to find out about my trip back to Brazil, I was surprised because the company canceled my flight and did not warn me. I contacted them via skype, as I currently live in Dublin, the first agent after 40 minutes attended me, super attentive but could not solve my situation, suggested that I buy a new flight from Dublin to Lisbon because this was the route canceled. I went on the website to look for and I didn't find flight 872 that left Dublin. I called the company again, the 3 agents disconnected the Skype call in the middle of the conversation. On the fourth attempt the very kind agent gave me a solution, we can change the date, ok, I will transfer it to the responsible sector. A man came to me whose name I don't remember, first he, according to him, did a search on the company's system, and informed me that it was more viable for me to get a ticket voucher and buy a new ticket in cash, I told him that I had no interest in the voucher, as I would lose one of the connections that I would make from São Paulo to my city Florianópolis. When I informed him that I would not use the voucher and would like a free solution, as I had already lost the right to use the connection from São Paulo to my city, he found a solution, I can send him to São Paulo July 3rd, great I accept, he removed my two checked bags that I paid for, it was a scam that the Tap company managed to deceive me bilaterally, I do not accept these conditions I demand that my luggage return to my boarding pass.

### "TAP clearly downgraded the service"
Operated by an Embraer 190 from TAP Express, former Portugália Airlines. The takeover from TAP clearly downgraded the service at Portugália Airlines. But it is a good aircraft for the route and eventually for the creation of a domestic air route similar to the one between Lisbon and Porto. No service onboard.

### "crew were with their backs turned"
As passengers entered the aircraft, cabin crew were with their backs turned, it seemed like cargo was entering the aircraft. The same on disembarking. They didn't serve anything due 'restrictions' of the ongoing pandemic. This is a service they are always very clamorous of offering and are included in the tariffs bought. It's very clear that older cabin crew, who have been professionally promoted, are far worse in terms of dealing with customers that the new ones. Many passengers weren't using masks and there was no warning from the cabin crew. I really don't know how this airline will survive and in what state of mind are the Portuguese Government to think of injecting money on this failed project which has been like this from the very beginning. Even with no flights at Lisbon airport, luggage were late.

### "best airline we have experienced"
My husband and I flew with TAP for the first time this year after four previous visits to Portugal. This our fifth flight was the best. We flew from Toronto direct to Lisbon on February 23, 2020. We were booked to fly home on April 1st but because of the coronavirus we had to make arrangements to fly home early. We were able to change our return flight from Lisbon to Toronto on March 24th without any extra fees. My husband and I are regular travellers all over the world and TAP was the best airline we have experienced. The check in, cabin staff, entertainment, seats, food were all 10/10 and that was in economy. I hope in these unknown economic times Portugal knows what a great resource they have with TAP Airlines and they support it to the max.

### "customer service is atrocious!"
When you fly with TAP, cross your fingers and pray that you will get to your destination on time and with your bags. If anything goes wrong and you have to deal with your customer service department, you will wish you had booked with someone else. Their customer service is atrocious!

### "One of my favourite airlines"
London Heathrow to Faro via Lisbon. One of my favourite airlines! Amazing crew and service, sometimes the check-in can be tricky at some airports, but I point my finger to the airport not to the airline. At LHR airport the guy managing the queue didn't know a clue about credit card verification, lost about 20 mins there. Boarding was excellent, no rush at all. One of the few airlines that gives food on economy and a generous bag allowance. I would fly more with TAP Portugal if they had direct flight's to Faro City.

### "keep cancelling your flight"
Luxembourg to Miami via Lisbon. Short in numbers: Phone bill for what they call customer service: USD 153.00 Total waiting time on the phone with terrible music: 7 hours 53 minutes. Managers i talked to: 3 Operators i talked to: 23 Flight route: Miami-Lisbon-Luxembourg Spend 153$ on phone bills not talking to anybody who can help changing a simple reservation! Customer service is the worst of all. In this review i respected the fact that it is a hard time for everybody during this pandemic but they would been better off transferring their customers to other airlines. Unfriendly, unhelpful, managers can’t help you either, they keep cancelling your flight without notice, giving you a “voucher” that takes weeks, even over a month to arrive. It is also a voucher that only works with TAP. Also TAP tickets cannot be transferred to other airlines that are in the same Star Alliance so i got pretty much stuck with them. Flights during the Covid19 outbreak can’t be rescheduled before end of may (what is ok) but not transferred to another airline, also when your flight gets rescheduled with TAP there is only one chance. If the flight gets cancelled you have to pay for a new ticket (thats what i got told by an operator on the phone), so no chance of doing anything. I rescheduled another flight for a friend who is with me that got cancelled by Swiss over United that took me 15 minutes to do and was totally free without any problem whatsoever! TAP’s international phone numbers are not working so you have to call them internationally, thats where they hang up on you.

### "Honest and inexpensive pricing"
Honest and inexpensive pricing of a one way ticket during the Covid 19 emergency. FNC-LIS-YYZ. Easy booking and fast receipt of electronic tickets. Flight time change communicated with plenty of notice. E mails were also sent by TAP in advance advising of elimination or reduction in on board service. The first leg of the flight was 25% full on an older Embraer but satisfactory for a 1 hour 40 minute flight. The delightful check in employee at FNC offered to include our packed to the max carry-on luggage with our checked hold luggage at no extra cost. Saved us lugging it on and off the plane. Really appreciated. Luggage arrived on the belt in Lisbon after a 30 minute wait which was slow for an airport with few flights that day. The next leg from LIS to YYZ was on a new, clean A330 Neo again no more than 25% full. Even though there was only one pass of cabin service in an 8 hour flight, it was very generous and the on board meal was delicious. The entertainment system was superb and cockpit announcements were simple and relevant. Flight arrived early and baggage delivery was fast in a near deserted Toronto airport.

### "Definitely not recommended"
Not Verified | Horrible customer service. Couldnt change my tickets or get a refund. Impossible to contact the company. Calls get hanged up. Definitely not recommended!

### "impossible to get a cash refund"
Montreal to Lisbon. Cancelled our trip for September and impossible to get a cash refund - will get a voucher? - that's not even legal. So just a warning - do not book on this airline unless you want to lose all your money - its that simple.

### "Atrocious customer service"
Miami to London via Lisbon. Have called and emailed them many times over the past 9 months trying to follow up a complaint. Have wasted many many hours of my life with this and still never received a response to my original query. Atrocious customer service. Would not recommend TAP Portugal as an airline.

### "disorganized, unprofessional"
Not Verified |  Amsterdam to Lisbon. I have flown several times with TAP Portugal. This airline has consistently been disorganized, unprofessional, usually late, not helpful, impossible to call (no one answers the phone) or get help even with the basics such as the booking. I have a flight booked to Israel by the end of the month. They rescheduled the flights several times. Due to the coronavirus and border closures I have been trying to cancel the flight. After several weeks their web system has still not processed my request, nor cancelled my booking nor issued a voucher. They have the most restrictive policy compared to any other airline regarding rebooking and rerouting in the coronavirus time, they still charge people fees. No other airline is that unkind in such a time. I think this is the worst airline with the worst customer service and the least professional I have ever experienced after flying for 40 years regularly. I will never fly with them again. I suggest for other customers - unless it's a very cheap flight and you don't mind being late and possibly have troubles along the way, don't book with this airline.

### "received no notification"
Not Verified |  We were scheduled to fly Malaga to Toronto via Lisbon on March 20, 2020. I checked online and saw, to my horror, that TAP had cancelled everything. We received no notification or any assistance, and so far no refund. They did this to thousands of customers who had flights to and from Spain, just as the Spanish announced their coronavirus measures. We spent a week, scrambling and stressed, trying to get home to Canada. Other airlines, notably British Airways, Easyjet, Air Transat and Vueling carried on as normal and even added additional flights. TAP abandoned us to our own devices without a word. How they remain a part of Star Alliance I'll never understand. Never again.

### "amateur and incompetent"
Not Verified |  I had three reservations with the company TAP Air Portugal, with departure scheduled for April 15, 2020 (from Belo Horizonte to Lisbon direct) and return scheduled for May 7th 2020. However, the airline canceled my one-way flight and apparently rescheduled it, without giving reasons. In addition, I intend to reschedule my trip because of the critical developments of the Covid-19 crisis, a pandemic whose epicenter is installed in Europe (destination of the trip). Therefore, I have been trying to contact the company for days and so far I have not been successful, either by e-mail or by phone. My last call lasted more than 30 minutes and was not answered! My reservation had an approximate cost of R $ 10,000.00 (ten thousand reais) and the treatment with the client is of total indifference! The company is amateur and incompetent to solve consumer demands. Contratei três reservas com a companhia TAP Air Portugal, com partida prevista para o dia 15 de abril de 2020 (de Belo Horizonte, com destino a Lisboa, em voo direto) e retorno previsto para o dia 07 de maio do mesmo ano. No entanto, a companhia cancelou o meu voo de ida e aparentemente o remarcou, sem apresentar justificativas. Além disso, pretendo remarcar minha viagem em razão dos críticos desdobramentos da crise do Covid-19, pandemia cujo epicentro está instalado na Europa (destino da viagem). Assim sendo, estou tentando contato com a companhia há dias e até agora não obtive sucesso, nem por e-mail, nem tampouco por telefone. Minha última ligação teve duração de mais de 30 minutos e não foi atendida! Minha reserva teve custo aproximado de R$10.000,00 (dez mil reais) e o tratamento com o cliente é de total indiferença! A companhia se mostra amadora e incompetente para solucionar as demandas do consumidor.

### "I lost money and time"
San Francisco to Lisbon. Tel +1 800 221-7370 - didn't answer me during 1 day no once! I had a ticket from US to Europe via London. US visa is enough to travel via London, but employee didn't know all rules that's why he canceled my trip. I lost money and time, I had to buy a new ticket and booked hotel to wait the new flight. I got a consultation with lower and he told that I could travel via London with US visa Beware TAP Portugal company. They just need your money!

### "Really bad airline"
Not Verified |  Lisbon to Miami. Really bad airline. Their website is not working. You can’t get anyone on the phone and they would not help me at the airport. I was told to call customer service at the 800 number that no one answers. They owe me money for 2 cancelled tickets and I don’t believe I’ll ever see my money. The TAP air staff has gone from warm & friendly to cold, rude and unfriendly.I will never fly TAP again.

### "not received our money back"
Not Verified |  We bought our tickets in December 2019 to Rome - Italy. With the current situation about coronavirus we cannot travel to that country due to the fact that 15million people are in quarantine these days. That country is the second highest risk in the world but until now this irresponsible airline has not cancelled the flight so we have not received our money back. American Airlines already cancelled their flight to Rome - Italy even for the flights in April 2020 and all the customers have received their money back 1 week ago. My flight is this Thursday (03/13/2020). It is so frustrating to see careless companies like this one putting lives in risk for money.

### "smooth and comfortable"
New York to Zurich via Lisbon. The flight to ZRH was smooth and comfortable, and the staff were kind and helpful. The food wasn't too bad. I had no issues with boarding or finding my luggage after the flight. My flight back was a bit more troublesome, though not quite at fault of the airline. There were delays on both of my flights (about an hour+ each), but the crew worked efficiently to ensure everyone made their connection flights. The whole trip was quite emotional for me as well, the staff having taken notice on my flight back and making sure I was okay. Overall, I was incredibly happy with TP's service, and will fly with them again in the near future!

### "scamming people left and right"
I had the worst experience with this airline. My mother was traveling from Caracas to Lisbon and when she arrived the airline counter they told her she needed a Yellow fever vaccine so she was refused to go on the plane because she need it that, so I had to paid a penalty of $371 for her to leave the next flight the following week. So I did that for my mother so I had spent a total $1000 on this trip. Time comes again for her to leave, she got the TAP air counter they didn't ask for the yellow fever vaccine card and she was able to leave this time. So I paid that $371 dollars for nothing because TAP air is scamming people left and right. This is not fair and people who flights with TAP air needs to know that. Till now I haven't got my money back.

### "shambolic on the ground"
London to Faro via Lisbon. TAP are pretty good in the air but shambolic on the ground. All four flights were relatively punctual on clean, modern aircraft. The crews were friendly and efficient, and provided a free snack and drink on the longer sectors. However TAP brought our connecting flight to Faro forward by an hour and didn't tell us. We only discovered when inputting flight details into the car hire booking three weeks ahead of departure. When we contacted TAP their attitude was: 'Whoops, didn't we tell you. The upshot was we had to take a much earlier flight from LHR which disrupted our accommodation and ground transport plans to the tune of £140. TAP would not consider compensation as it was more than two weeks from departure, even though they had not clocked the change! On the way home we had checked in online, but we still had to queue for the best part of an hour at the bag drop. And, as at LHR, they had difficulty in locating our pre-paid golf clubs on their computer system. Additionally, they completed the boarding process for both the Lisbon and LHR flights far earlier than was necessary, leaving us cooped up at a crowded gate in Faro and standing on a bus at Lisbon for half an hour as they removed the incoming luggage and cleaned the plane. We have used TAP a few times before and have two upcoming trips to Portugal. Their prices are fair and the in-flight experience is fine, whether I can face the hassle of dealing them again.

### "lowest of a low budget airline"
Vienna to Sao Vicente via Lisbon. TAP turned regular economy seat into substandard even with comparison to low budget airlines, so that the regular now can be branded as EconomyXtra. It is sad how TAP in the last few years transformed from one of the best European airlines in economy into the worst. They narrowed their regular economy seats just to make a visible difference between so called EconomyXtra and Economy – and really make passengers suffer – without even get an extra space for more seats in economy. The catering hat shrank so much that someone will not even notice when it will disappear completely. Our flights from Vienna to São Vicente via Lisbon and back were more or less on time, cabin crews more or less fine, however seating is for such long flights more or less unbearable. Unfortunately, for São Vicente airport TAP is more or less the only option. It's hard to understand their policy: They are letting passengers changing seats between Economy and EconomyXtra (so, why paying for Xtra? ), on the other hand they intentionally seat two passengers under the same reservation number in totally different parts of the cabin expecting to pay for seats together (despite more than a third of the cabin being empty). Approach lower than the lowest of a low budget airline, however with the price far from being low. Will avoid them in the future whenever possible, despite being a regular loyal passenger of TAP Portugal for years.

### "I wouldn’t book with them again"
A day before flying from London to Rio via Lisbon I was called up to 6 times by someone in Brazil trying to sell me business class tickets! Initially I was worried thinking the call was to notify me of an urgent last minute change but it was just call after call, every 5 minutes to ask if I wanted to upgrade from economy, at a fee. In addition to these calls I was also receiving emails. These emails asked me to bid to upgrade my tickets (starting bid was 500euros)! If I was successful I would get the upgrade at whatever price I bidded. Is this normal?? Is this allowed? When boarding the flight in London to Lisbon (first leg of the trip to Rio), the process was efficient and the plane was empty! We were lucky enough to get premium economy anyway when we checked in online (at no extra cost)! Lisbon to Rio was okay. It was packed and I will say the economy seats weren’t comfortable but I was in the middle of a 4 seater row for a 9 hour flight. The food was actually terrible. There were a few times we had to flag the hosts down for a drink as we were quite thirsty. I had a turkey pasta dish. Snacks included bread and cheese. Only wine and beer available as alcoholic beverages. Thankfully this plane had a USB port for charging and a decent monitor for movies/ shows/ games. On the way back to London same sales call issue. Luckily my mobile contact number they had was rejecting calls so any calls to push upgrades to me didn’t come through to me but my friend on the other hand, kept having to reject incoming calls from TAP airlines who were trying to sell upgraded seats again (she got charged for answering the first call by the way). The plane from Rio to Porto (9 hours + journey) was an old one and didn’t have a USB port. They didn’t provide blankets or pillows on this long haul flight from Rio to Porto (it was cold by the way)! The food wasn’t nice but was better. I had rice with a meat. In Porto, we rushed from the plane to catch our connecting flight back to London (the gate number isn’t clearly written anywhere by the way. Just one screen in front of a coffee shop). We boarded the plane and surprisingly there wasn’t a USB port (that’s 14 hours travelling with no charging options) luckily I had my emergency charger pack with me so I could book my cab once back in London. My flights were cheap but I wouldn’t book with them again. The service just wasn’t good enough for me to do so. I hope someone from TAP reads this to look into how often their sales department reach out to people as I’m pretty sure I didn’t ask to be suffocated with unreasonable offers via email and phone calls.

### "Flight was almost empty"
Lisbon to Funchal. Flight was almost empty which although not reflected on the ticket price was a very nice and calm morning journey with very attentive cabin crew and a good sandwich. Thanks for the gentle wake up before landing. TAP product is good with the exception of the odd inconsistency and their absurd expensive flights to and from Madeira.

### "not a single good thing I can say"
Vienna to Lisbon. Don’t get fooled by the price. There is not a single good thing I can say about this airline. I should have read others’ reviews. The whole thing was a disaster from the booking to when we landed. I first booked a flight on their app and it was canceled after a few minutes without any notice. The website and this app sucks!!! I called them and they told me I have to book again which I wish I had used this opportunity to run away far, but I didn’t. So I booked another flight and this time they asked for some documentation before final reservation and I was in the state of “not knowing” whether my flight is finally booked or not. I called them 3 or four times and each time they put me on hold for a long time. Finally after 4 hours I received the confirmation. Then at the airport they made me to pay €180 for a hand luggage that was only about a kilo heavier. I had a connecting flight and the first flight landed with a delay which caused me a lot of stress and I had to stay behind a huge line because of the short time I had for the second flight. The food was meh and the service was meh. On top of all these great things the second flight departed late too.

### "Worst service ever"
19 Dec 2019 me and my wife had a business class trip booked with TAP Air Portugal from Copenhagen to Las Palmas via Lisbon. Due to the late incoming flight to Lisbon, we missed the connection flight to Las Palmas. We went to the transfer center and the woman who “helped” us said that there was no way we could go to Las Palmas that day – and the TAP Air Flight the 20th December between Lisbon and Las Palmas “are already overbooked” she said. I showed her two different ways to go to Las Palmas from Lisbon the same day – “we don´t cooperate with those airlines” she said. (What a customer oriented airline TAP is.) So she put us on a trip Lisbon-Porto 12.00 (in Portugal) and then Porto-Madrid in Spain 21.40 in the evening (arriving midnight in Spain due to different time zones). Almost 9 hours at the airport in Porto. But she refused to book hotel to us in Madrid. The morning after we were booked on an Iberia flight from Madrid to Las Palmas departing 08.40 in the morning My luggage was the left in Lisbon – it arrived to out hotel in Gran Canaria 61,5 hours after check in at Copenhagen airport. In Porto we went to the TAP counter in Porto. There was a man and a woman in the counter – and no queue, only us there. More uninterested people you have to look for. They couldn´t care less! They also refused to help us to book Hotel and transfer. Finally me and my wife had to book a hotel by ourselves at Madrid airport! We arrived at Las Palmas airport almost 24 hours late – and my luggage arrived 2,5 days late. Summary: Worst service ever when in need, both in Lisbon and in Porto – and now, at the Service center where we claim compensation for our expenses. Suddenly, they stopped answering our emails.

### "such a bad experience"
Porto to Munich. What is supposed to be a 2 hours flight became a whole day lost due to departure delay after departure delay after departure delay ( 3 hours so far and still counting, hope I ll take off by tomorrow). No information ahead, no updates, nothing. Even when flying with low cost airlines I never had such a bad experience.

### "the worst traveling experience"
Boston to Barcelona via Lisbon. This was by far the worst traveling experience i have had. Our flight from Boston was cancelled on the night of the flight. After waiting for a long time to board, the airline representative simply told us the flight had been cancelled due to aircraft malfunction. We were told that we could wait in line to be re-routed. While we were waiting (for hours) and before we were able to speak to anyone, the airline announced that they could not help us anymore that we needed to go home and to call the airline, a number in Portugal to get a new flight. Once we finally got through we were offered a flight leaving the following day but not even from Boston, but Newark (3.5 hours away by car) when we asked if they were going to pay for our transportation they pretty much laughed in our face. But that wasn’t the end of the nightmare, they gave us a flight that now had an additional stop over in Porto with another flight to Lisbon before finally arriving to Barcelona. So we rented a car, at our expense, and travelled 4 hours the next day to Newark. While boarding the new flight, we were told that we needed to check our carry-on luggage, even though it met the necessary requirements as to size etc. we were pretty much forced by the airline employees to check the luggage, i felt i was in a fourth world country, third world doesn’t begin to tell the story. We had to cancel a road trip to Bilbao that we were planning to do the same week and lost the museum tickets we had bought weeks in advance because we no longer had time. We were traveling with our three daughters (twins 10 year old and a 13 year old). So we finally arrived in Barcelona Sunday at 5 pm instead of the Saturday morning arrival we had planned, completely exhausted and with a sick child. Almost two days of our vacation gone! So if you think you will be saving a few bucks by flying with TAP Portugal, think again! The experience turned out for us as the most expensive and uncomfortable flight we’ve ever taken. Our first and last TAP flight!

### "Service was attentive"
Not Verified |  Excellent business class product on this short Lisbon to London  route. One of the few routes within Europe that receives a proper business class with their A330s often operating. Service was attentive and the food was good. Lounge in LIS was busy but the food and drink options were acceptable.

### "The food was tasty"
Funchal to Lisbon. The food was tasty,  tea served was perfect. In terms of seat confort it couldn't be better. Nice that they reintroduced the full curtain on executive. A big thank you for noticing my lost bag on the overhead compartments after I asked for help at the lost and found section and for alerting me of the duty free products that had fallen as I was leaving the aircraft.

### "never fly again with TAP"
Amsterdam to Lisbon. You expect an airline to take care of their passengers. TAP Portugal does not. On December 14, 2019 I booked a ticket out of Amsterdam to Lisbon for the dates of February 5, returning February 11 2020. The ticket price for me and my wife was 374 euros. On January 28 I noticed that we could not return February 11, but only on February 12. Calling the reservation department in Amsterdam of TAP resulted in a fine of 344 euros, almost the same price as a complete new ticket on those days. The price of such a ticket would have been 378 euros. Only later, on February 5 I found out that the penalty of changing a ticket is only 90 euros for each ticket and perhaps the difference of the ticket prices. That would have resulted in a fine for the both of us of 180 euros plus 34 euros, in total still 214 euros. When complaining on the Website of TAP, we got the answer that we should consult the reservation department. Calling the reservation department, we received as an answer that we should complain on the website. Asking for an address to complain in writing they said that such an address was non existent. They agreed, however, that it would have been better to have cancelled the ticket and buy a new one, as you receive the taxes back, which would have been more favoable for us. Unfortunately, they believe that they do not have to be that helpful for a passenger. So if you do not tell them explicitly that you want to cancel, they do not feel obliged to tell you what would be the most favorable option for you. Anyhow, we complained again by the website, explaining the situation. First of all, they considered the situation as finished and did not give an answer at all. Complaining about this, we received the answer that the flight was in the past and that they, therefore, could not be of any help. Receiving such an answer makes you feel completely helpless against TAP and your only option is never fly again with TAP.

### "business class very uncomfortable"
Miami to Prague via Lisbon. Trip started badly, as my United frequent flyer number was not accepted by their system, only the TAP number could be entered. Emails are ignored, although I have tried! The plane was new, but even in business class very uncomfortable. Seats give little room to sleep, feels really cramped. The staff were very sullen and uninterested in the passengers, gave a poor attitude to any questions. Food was really bad, cannot believe that they cannot provide a better quality.

### "professional, efficient and friendly"
Lisbon to Funchal. Cabin crew was professional, efficient and friendly, something I think it is worth noting in a nowadays rather impersonal and detached business mode in aviation. Flight attendants were quick to demonstrate security procedures which make it possible for the aircraft to leave with a smaller delay than expected. Plane could be cleaner but it was the last flight of the day.

### "Website payment system is archaic"
Nice to Lisbon with TAP Portugal. Website payment system is archaic, payment went through but not registered on their website (2 times) which had the amount twice frozen on my bank account for 3 days. Customer support by phone was unable to understand my issue and didn't care for it. Changed my booking on return flight and called them, they hung up on me twice during the payment by phone, and charged me extra 20 euros cause I did it by phone, while their website wouldn't work.

### "Not a good choice and never again"
Not Verified |  I am Emerald Status with BA/One World and have slipped from Gold to Sliver with Star Alliance (Aegean). Reluctantly agreed to fly TAP to Lisbon because of slightly better timing. Big Mistake. Chaotic boarding at Heathrow. Very strict on Cabin Baggage - enforce the 8.0kg rule - mine was 8.5 and had to check it in. The announced that Silver Status was included in priority boarding along with Business Class and Star Gold. Got to the front of the queue and was dismissed to the back of the general boarding as 'only TAP silver' was recognised. On board - very cramped. Not a good choice and never again.

### "the stewards seemed to be tired"
Warsaw to Lisbon. Bad experience: check-in delayed and chaotic, in business class the legroom is a shame, I suppose it was the same or very similar to this in economy class, the stewards seemed to be tired, the plane was old and dirty, the bathroom in the front was out-of-order, there was a lot of other TAP personnel who were seating mostly in business, often chatting with their colleagues on the shift. The flight was over 1 hour late and TAP did not send my baggage on the next flight on time. I received it 24 hours later.

### "worst trends on low cost airlines"
Lisbon to Funchal. TAP Portugal has lost much due to oversized efforts to parallel regular European and budget competitors. Ticket price in Economy class now renegates passengers to the worst trends on mediocre low cost airlines. Plane almost empty.

### "provided terrible service"
Not Verified |  London to Lisbon. This airline has provided me with a terrible service, leaving passengers without any information or food during the 6 hours our flight was delayed and then blamed the delay on the weather conditions (fog). I had my family waiting for me in Lisbon and they could confirm that at 19:10 (time my flight was supposed to be landing) there was no signs of fog whatsoever. Furthermore, when we landed in Lisbon around 1 a.m. the weather was foggy and we managed to land anyway so what made a difference then? The way this airline treats customers is just unnacceptable and they don't even offer any compensation for all the trouble. I won't recommend you flying with them.

### "staff were fantastic"
Lisbon airport has a chronic capacity issue including a lack of boarding waiting rooms. But a lot of buses. After multiple experiences, I believe that in order to free boarding gates, the following procedures are being followed: Boarding starts early, and passengers are parked in fingers, sometimes more than 15 min. Then they might board directly to aircraft, where they will wait for 20 to 25 mn before moving, they might also take a ride in a bus to aircraft. Arriving at the aircraft, they will remain in the bus for at least 10 mn, sometimes 15mn. Once more, the second case happened to us, in a cold early morning. And it was really unpleasant. On the other side, staff were fantastic, Embraer 2x2 seats very comfortable, as well as a nice breakfast (albeit cold) was served. No priority luggage deliver at MRS, as usual.

### "Seat was rather hard"
Salvador airport has no lounge and international boarding is at new gates (24+), very far away from bars and restaurants. As the aircraft was 2 hours late upon arrival, immigration control was postponed and we were stuck in a deserted place with no support from the airline. Only 2 small vending machines for 300 pax, and they were soon broken. Departure was at at 01.30 am, and FAs succeeded in serving a full dinner very quickly after taking off. Seat was rather hard, and constant turbulences made it harder. Very late arrival in Lisbon. TAP did not provide a finger and we went to a remote tarmac area where we had to wait 17 min for buses. This was a mistake. Many passengers did not succeed in connecting.

### "online check-in is useless"
Madrid to Lisbon. Poor and unfriendly service. Arrive at 7.30 for a bag drip at 8am on 1 Jan 2020. Check-in counter didn’t open until about 8.15am with only one counter open. We queued in one line until finally, they opened another two check-in counters. When the other counters were opened, no one bothered to guide people who are in one line to go to bag drop. So in short, online check-in is useless.

### "seats are among the worst"
Not Verified | They charge more than any other airline for luggage $120 USD for the first piece of checked baggage from Miami to Lisbon. The seats are among the worst in the industry. Extremely tight. They are very strict with the limit for carry-on baggage. They were charging people who had 11 kg rather than 10. Overall they are worse in that respect than the European discount carriers like Ryanair. Wizz. Etc

### "treatment of customers appalling"
London to Accra via Lisbon. My flight to Accra was cancelled on 24/12/19. It was a 6am flight so we arrived very early before 4am. The treatment of the customers was appalling. An alternative flight given me leaves London on 25/12/19 at 9.40pm and it’s a 28 hours flight to get to Ghana. Why? Because that was the only flight available for me and family. I shall never use TAP again, you are rubbish and a disgraceful airline. Lying that the weather was to blame didn’t help you as we checked online the weather in Lisbon and it was good. Due to TAP fear of compensation they are lying to the  customer. I shall not use TAP again.

### "I was treated like cattle"
Prague to Boston via Lisbon. After delays taking off for 2 hours I was continually delayed the entire day and the TAP Portugal couldn’t have cared less. I was treated like cattle and will try to avoid flying them ever again!! Do yourself a favor and don’t bother flying with This airline!

### "never been mistreated this way"
Not Verified |  Brussels to Rio de Janeiro via Lisbon . Our flight from Brussels to Lisbon got delayed yesterday so we missed our flight to Rio. We got a 3,3 euro voucher, not even enough to buy a drink. In Brussels they say that they would pick us up in Lisbon give us an hotel. When we arrive in Lisbon nothing, no information, no hotel, just a cold airport floor to "sleep" on. Not even a blanket. In the flight a kid vomited on me, the hostesses did nothing. Didn't clean my chair our help me with my dirty clothes that I still need to ware for another 18hours. When we ask if we can use the TAP premium lounge, they send us away. We travel a Lott, but never been mistreated this way.

### "Total apathy to its customers"
Not Verified |  London to Miami via Lisbon. My flight to Lisbon was cancelled due to bad weather in Portugal, which I understand. What I don't understand and don't accept is the indifference shown by TAP staff at Heathrow. After queuing for ages (having arrived at Heathrow at 3.30am), they eventually opened the ticket desk hours later. We were told our seats had been re-arranged onto a direct flight with American Airlines to Miami - which was good news. It was only when we tried to check in with AA that we found the ticket was for tomorrow, i.e. the next day! Despite the delay and massive inconvenience, we weren't even offered a food voucher. Why did they not contact us with the re-arranged flight (which was useless to us as we would have arrived too late for our cruise? Total apathy to its customers. Never again.

### "TAP are hopelessly behind"
Recife to Lisbon. Horrible, absolutely horrible. Whole family were sick on trip over due to constant turbulence. No apologies or grace from unpleasant staff, and no reassurance on announcements either. Sometimes, it just can’t be helped, but what can be helped was their attitude to my autistic child. Customer service can’t seem to understand why the child would need a parent at either side. We were told that after paying £99 to secure this “privilege” (we had been booked with one parent across the aisle), that we could be refunded, which has since been denied. In a world where so many companies are waking up to the need for better services for autistic children, TAP are hopelessly behind. Thank goodness I spent the extra £99 to have the privilege to secure his head as he vomited into my hands on a nightmare flight. Never again!

### "will never take TAP again"
Munich to Lisbon, 1 hour layover and Lisbon to Madrid. The breakfast was muffin, yogurt and poor croissant. The plane landed 20 minutes late, the transport bus was 10 minutes late and then the bus took 10 minutes to reach the arrival gate. I missed my flight to Madrid. The staff sent us to a helpdesk where we stood for 2 hours to get another ticket, 7 hours after the original departure time. I will pay more but will never take TAP again.

### "won’t be flying with you again"
Lisbon to Marseille. I’ve made 8 phone calls to TAP Portugal since this morning trying in vain to register oversized baggage. I’ve spoken to 8 different staff members and more than 1 hour on hold (mostly on hold actually) and I’m still none the wiser if I will be obliged to abandon my surfboard at Lisbon airport tomorrow. The suspense is palpable, thanks TAP, I won’t be flying with you again. Just to be clear I blame the system not the staff.

### "One of the worst airlines"
New York to Zurich via Lisbon. One of the worst airlines. Lack of quality and proper service is causing flight experience a horror. Theyare one of the worst in Europe. I have never queued 15min to access the lounge!

### "This airline is horrible"
Our flight from Faro to Lisbon was cancelled on us last minute with no warning .. we had to take a taxi to Lisbon to catch our connecting flight to Toronto. The taxi ride cost 400 Euro, once in Lisbon TAP tried to refuse letting us board our connecting flight! They said it was full and we couldn't board ... after hours or arguing and stressful debate we managed to board our flight. Once on the flight I counted 12 empty seats in my section alone. I'm not sure why they lied about flight being full. Once in Toronto we were notified that TAP had lost our baggage. Fast forward to now, 4 months later, I have been in almost a constant daily battle with TAP as to the status of my claim for the refund I am owed for cancelled flight we never boarded, baggage fees we paid for that we never used on first flight and that TAP lost on the second!! This airline has been horrible to deal with and completely ignorant to me has belittled me every step of the way. The last email I received stated they considered the matter done! So TAP is officially admitting to stealing thousands of dollars from me and walking away with zero remorse.. This airline is horrible and our flight experience was the worst I ever encountered .. we were lied to by every single employee we had communications with .. each one lying to not have to own up to the issues their airline created! If you enjoy throwing away money and spending a day from hell in the airport to try and do TAP staffs jobs for them then book with this airline.. If you want service for your money book with any other airline than TAP!

### "Unpleasant experience"
Lisbon to Paris Orly. Unpleasant experience. A 2.5-hour flight was 1 hour late arriving. Boarding was chaotic. Two agents behind the counter checking boarding passes but nobody at the queues, so passengers started cheating by queuing for boarding zones that they do not belong. The PA system on the flight was so loud that my ears hurt. I flew Economy Plus and was "rewarded" with a mystery wrap sandwich that looked like a wet toilet paper roll. The flight was cheap, but not Ryanair-cheap.

### "book through a different company"
Boston to Malaga via Lisbon. I booked a ticket and hadn’t received a confirmation email in several hours, so I called customer service and provided the confirmation number I’d received when booking. The representative told me they’d canceled the transaction and couldn’t give me a reason as to why, so she put me on hold to talk with someone else. I waited over half an hour, and no one took the call, so I hung up. However, several days later, I saw that the charge for my “canceled” reservation had posted to my credit card, but I had no ticket to show for it. I therefore contacted TAP customer service by Facebook Messenger and spent several hours talking with them. They consistently denied that the charge had gone through, even though I could clearly see on my bank account that it had. Finally, they admitted it had gone through and reimbursed me. No one ever let me know that a) my reservation had been canceled (or why it had been canceled) or b) that my money had nonetheless been taken. If I hadn’t been more on top of it, I could have shown up to the airport the day of the flight, thinking I had a ticket, and they would have told me then that my reservation had been canceled. When I asked for some compensation for the hours I spent on this and stress this caused, they wrote to me “we apologize for any kind of distress caused, but there's no place for offers in this case. Payments done online are processed automatically by the system and it is not possible to check if all the payments go through or not.” This is a bizarre excuse—obviously they should prioritize returning money to customers when flights are cancelled on their end. Some sort of extra compensation would have shown they were truly sorry for what appears to be scamming a customer. So please, if you book through this company, check and double check that they haven’t overcharged you! Or better: just book through a different company!

### "not be traveling TAP Portugal in future"
Newark to Florence via Lisbon. Our flight was scheduled to leave at 6 pm; however, the airplane was late coming in and therefore, we were late leaving. However, when we landed in Lisbon, there was 30 minutes to get to the next flight and were first told we would have to run to make the flight - we were rushed through immigration and rushed to the gate just to be told that the airplane closed its doors early and we therefore, could not get on the flight. There were at least 8 or 10 of us in this situation. The next This flight was 6:50 am. The next flight was not until 4 pm. The airline automatically booked us on the 4 pm flight without telling us so were they lying to us saying we could get on the flight if we run knowing we weren't getting on it at all? Lastly, there was only one customer service rep available to assist all of the people stranded in Lisbon and we had to wait on a line for one hour to just be told they could not help us. I sent an email to the airline and to add insult to injury, they didn't even have the decency to respond! I guess we will not be traveling TAP Portugal in the future.

### TAP Portugal customer review
Lisbon to Miami in a new A330 NEO. paid some extra for the Economy extra. The extra leg room and seat recline is a good add to the trip comfort. I noticed the silence in the cabin when compared with the previous version. The entertainment was really good with a good screen. The staff was charming and communicative during the flight. Positively surprised. The free whassap texts using the Aircraft wifi were a nice touch which I used to keep in touch with people during the flight.

### "service was good"
Very pleasant flight from Amsterdam to Lisbon on a Saturday morning. I booked the flight 2 months before and the week prior to the flight TAP Portugal emailed me inviting to bid for a Business class upgrade. I got the upgrade and was totally a good idea. Amsterdam is very busy early morning, so was great to go through security really quickly and chill having breakfast at the lounge. The flight was on time in a brand new A321 NEO. Very silent and quiet flight. The crew was very polite and the service was good for the European standard.

### "we missed the connection"
Miami to Madrid via Lisbon. We decided to use TAP since they had an early arrival into Madrid which would allow us to enjoy the city before heading off to Valencia. When we arrived into Lisbon to transfer, we were told that we missed the connection although there were no delays at origin. We were put on the LAST flight of the evening. We asked to be put on one of the other earlier flights during that day and was told to keep checking back. We therefore stayed at the airport keep checking in... Nothing. Once we eventually took off +12 hours later, we encountered a freak storm which did not allow us to land in Madrid but had to return to Lisbon - no fault of the airline but at this point, we have been travelling a very long time and very exhausted. Due to the late departure from Lisbon, we lost 2 of our day tours, our airport car service and our hotel booking. We eventually landed in Madrid Tuesday morning around 3AM -( our original arrival was Monday at 8AM) The Agent in Lisbon informed us that anything over 4 or 6 hour delay, we are to be reimbursed for any losses and that we need to submit a claim. Upon our return Ifiled the claim, submitted a letter along with all of the receipts. After 2 months, we were contacted by TAP customer service asking for the booking back up again. I provided it. Then they asked for the hotel booking - i provided it again. Then they asked for the proof of charge. I provided that. They asked for proof that we did not check into the hotel. After i explained that there is no written proof i can provide, they responded that they will reimburse us for the hotel and nothing else. Not the loss of our expensive tours, not our transfers. I went back and forth with customer service for 3 consecutive days and got no where.

### "service onboard lower than low cost
Lisbon to Luxembourg. The service onboard is lower than a low cost. The seat have no room for my legs and you pay every extra. They have lost a lot in last year's.

### "airline decides to switch the seats"
Not Verified | Lisbon to Miami. After booking our business class seats for my wife and I many months ago this airline decides to switch the seats we booked next to each other to a row apart and no one wants to fix this. What a joke. We saw this happen to another family on the way here so I guess it’s a conman practice. We should not have to beg other customers to switch seats

### "our flight is cancelled"
We were supposed to fly Lisbon to Frankfurt on August 3rd. After several announcements the flight is delayed by 30 minutes, all this time all passengers queuing up ready to board, at 20:20 - exactly 2 hours after scheduled departure there was another announcement that our flight is cancelled "due to technical reasons" and that we are supposed to come to gate 18 for new boarding passes at 21:15. After this 2 TAP employees that were present at our gate just turned and walked away. It was very weird that we should wait nearly 1 more hour and then go to some other gate to deal with this issue. We went to gate 18 directly. At the head of the crowd there were 2 TAP employees. Is it our flight that is being sorted already? I asked one of the passengers leaving the crowd with a new boarding pass in hand. No, it is a flight that was supposed to leave for Brussels at 16:00 that was cancelled. There were 2 police officers and 2 employees of a security company at gate 18 too looking at everything going on. We went to TAP transfer center located inside the airport hoping to get help there. There was another crowd of passengers from cancelled TAP flight to Paris with the whole transfer center being serviced by 2 more TAP employees only. We went back to gate 18 and about 22:00 it was a policeman who said that there is something wrong here and passengers of our flight will have to stand the whole night at gate 18, if it will continue like this, so he made a call and in about 10 minutes 3 more TAP employees showed-up (where were they before?) and made new announcement that passengers of our flight to Frankfurt should go back to gate 16 and they will deal with us there. At midnight standing in queue at reception of San Malhoa hotel in Lisbon where TAP was sending everyone I met some people from cancelled TAP flight to Berlin. So, this day there were minimum 4 flights that TAP cancelled due to technical reasons.

### "they gave me a no show"
Zurich to Oporto. TAP Portugal canceled my return tickets, as there were more passengers on board than there were seats on the plane. No replacement, just canceled. In my flight history, they gave me a no show.

### "Horrendous customer service"
Lisbon to London. Horrendous customer service, airport packed - no staff at transfer desk. Stupid system of checking boarding passes with staff giving you certain directions and other staff members embarrassing you for doing so!

### "horrible customer service"
Venice to New York via Lisbon. This was my first time flying with Tap Portugal and it will be my last. After being asked to check my bag that was intended to be a carry on because of the contents inside of it. I come home to find that an irreplaceable handmade bowl I purchased was broken. When I reached out for compensation I was given a generic response that basically said that Tap Portugal isn’t liable for damaged items and they would not be reimbursing me. Customers expect their checked baggage to be handled with the best of care since we are paying for the service and Tap Portugal failed to provide that. They know their customers are not aware of this article until something in their bag is already broken. Tap Portugal employees should be required to tell customers that this company will not take responsibility for items broken as a result of the carelessness and recklessness of its employees. I will no longer fly with Tap Portugal and I will be sure to warn other travelers to steer clear of Tap Portugal because of your company's horrible customer service.

### "Will not fly with them again"
Newark to Amsterdam via Lisbon. 90 minutes late leaving Newark. The flight was ok. Late arrival in Lisbon, very short transfer time. Got on 2nd plane, after everyone was on board, the flight was delayed because of baggage handling, but nothing was added to the plane because no doors opened or closed. We sat for 40 minutes then was told it would be a 30-minute delay to get in line to leave the airport. I've never heard of that before. Late take-offs get priority for leaving. Once airborne, we hit every turbulence pocket in the sky. When we landed, the baggage was delayed 20 additional minutes because of "equipment issues". Will not fly with them again and suggest you find other arrangements

### "they checked our hand luggage"
Munich to Lisbon. In both flights they checked our hand luggage although there was plenty of space in the aircraft. Also the crew was surprised about that. Leg space is very small and the snacks were ok. As I silver member of star alliance I can say that this company bring the average of the group down.

### "flight attendants super charming"
Dublin to New York via Lisbon. I feel like TAP is getting a bit of a bum rap here. They certainly do have an issue with punctuality and I don't recommend tight connections. The flight out of Dublin was 45 mins late and the connection out of Lisbon had one of those annoying unannounced and creeping boarding delays which leave passengers shuffling in lines. But aside from that, the flights were nice. The flight out of Dublin was no more uncomfortable than other intra-European flights. The JFK flight had comfortable Recaro seats and remarkably excellent IFE. Food was pretty good on both sectors, flight attendants were super charming and worked hard. They even responded to the call button which is almost unheard of these days. They also have excellent fares on connecting flights so all in all, I thought a very good option.

### "Horrible experience"
Nice to Ponta Delgada via Lisbon. Terrible company. Lost my suitcase and I was at a conference the next morning presenting my work. They advised me to buy what I needed and keep the receipts to be reimbursed. A month later, TAP wrote to let me know they would not reimburse me because their policy is different. On the way back, they delayed my flight and as a result I missed my connection flight. They didn’t organise a hotel for us nor did they pay for it. Still waiting to hear back from them. Horrible experience and customer service, stay away.

### "have you check carry on luggage"
Lisbon to Miami. This was my third experience with TAP. Same issue every time. They have argumentative, very rude and unhappy employees, and no customer service. Their tactic is to have you check carry on luggage claiming the flight is full and there is no overhead compartment space available. I was targeted at the check in counter for having a large bag that they said would not fit in the overhead bin. I have flown with this bag many times, which is TSA carry on compliant, in many airlines including small planes. It fits perfectly in the overhead bin! Other people had larger bags than me and carried them on board. I refused to check my bag in at the ticket counter. I was harassed about the bag at the boarding gate by the gate agent. Upon boarding the aircraft and stowing away my luggage in the overhead bin, the flight attendant came over to my seat and ask to see my boarding pass and had me identify my bag that was already stowed in the overhead compartment. I was forced to check my bag in because they said there was no space even though there was still space available next to my bag.

### "we ended up with horrible seats"
Lisbon to Toronto. My husband and I spent extra money to purchase certain type of tickets: the one that gave us certain amount of miles and have 1 piece of luggage checked. We also paid extra money for certain seats. The aircraft was changed and we ended up with horrible seats in the end of the plane which did not allow me to sleep at all. I contacted the airline and requested a refund for the seats purchased since we never got them. No response. They refused to give us the miles as well without any explanations and it is impossible to talk to anyone about the situation. Our first flight to Lisbon was so good, that I even took the time to do their survey and gave them 10 out of 10. Now I feel like an idiot. I will avoid flying this airline in future at all costs.

### "I will not fly them again"
I recently flew on TAP Portugal from Miami to Lisbon and back. On the outgoing trip they cancelled my 4:00 PM flight without explanation and substituted a 3:30 AM flight the next day, which caused me to miss my group. On the outgoing flight I paid extra 95 euros online the night before my departure for extra baggage which I did not require when I departed. I applied for a refund and was told that the charge is "nonrefundable". I will not fly them again.

### "my baggage got delayed"
Not Verified |  First my baggage got delayed from Lisbon to Bissau. no one could keep me informed. Secondly, It took me more than 2 hours to check in at the airport in Bissau because their system was down. I unfortunately missed my connection from Lisbon to Paris. The lady at the county for receiving customers complaints was horrible, she has no consideration for customers. She treated me with no consideration. I observed other customers and they were treated the same way. It was a chaos with all the people who came to her at the time i was there. I had a very bad experience with them. I filed a claim fo reimbursement because the delay.

### "need to focus on quality of service"
Washington to Manchester via Lisbon. Smooth check in. Business lounges, both at IAD and in Lisbon are serving the purpose and there are plenty of food and beverages. I was not offered business lounge access upon return at Manchester, UK. Not sure if they have an arrangement with business lounge or not. Inflight entertainment IAD to Lisbon and return was good but non existing from Lisbon to Manchester. They use economy seats with middle seat open as business class from/to Manchester-Lisbon. What a joke. It was 3 hours flight with no IFE and no real business class seats. Inflight meals were just OK, nothing so great about it. At all airports (IAD, LIS, and MAN) I noticed lack of management at boarding time. They just line you up, take your boarding pass, and make you even wait inside buss because crew is not ready to take passengers. Very unorganized. I believe instead of rapid expansion, they need to focus on quality of service, both on board and on ground specially.

### "Just functional"
Not Verified | Sao Vicente to London Heathrow via Lisbon. TAP Portugal is much like the other airlines in Star Alliance. Not terrible and not great. Not a great experience, but will get you from A to B, and that is the point after all. Just functional.

### "Terrible airline and customer service"
Dublin to Washington via Lisbon. Terrible airline and customer service. Boarding for TAP in Dublin was in a completely different area and floor than all other airlines without any signage, and check in closed early so I ended up having to pay to ship my luggage back to the states. The agents I was eventually sent to were actually from Swissport, not TAP, and were completely unhelpful. Both of my flights boarded and left late, "business" class seats on the first flight were the same as every other seat just with a much higher price, food was mediocre, and I was told there was no record of my preordered meal and my selected option had already run out. We had to go through multiple custom and security checks connecting in Lisbon, flight attendants were unfriendly, and the internet I paid for stopped working after one minute. After submitting a contact on the website about all of these issues, it took a month to hear back and they took zero responsibility for any of it. Fly any other airline.

### "They are absolutely horrible"
Chicago to Lisbon. I tried to check in on line and it said that there was an additional baggage charge of $120. I had already paid $92 for my suitcase but never having flown on TAP Portugal I thought they increased the fee by $28 so I clicked yes. Then afterward I saw they charged me $120 so I called them and they told me I consented to pay $120 for additional luggage. I told them I only had 1 suitcase and there was a misunderstanding on my part as to their communication. They told me there was nothing they could do about it. I asked to speak with a manager but the agent said that wasn't possible. If you want to have good customer service do not fly TAP Portugal. They are absolutely horrible.

### "1 hour late but cheap 51€"
Berlin to Lisbon. Very long waiting times at the security check. Total 1 hour late. But cheap (51 €), good food on the board, nice staff. My recommendation! Press the boarding pass, then you will not have to wait in the queue. Sehr lange Wartezeiten beim Sicherheitscheck. Insgesamt 1 St. Verspätung. Aber dafür günstig (51€), gutes Essen am Board, nettes Personal. Meine Empfehlung! Drückt die Bordkarte aus, dann müsst ihr nicht in der Warteschlage anstehen .

### "service extremely slow"
Lisbon to London. Although Lisbon airport is in general a mess, flying with a Business class ticket allows for a faster security screening, making it a much easier process. The boarding was to a remote parking stand, but also expedite enough. There was no information that the flight would be delayed, and the doors were closed a few minutes before scheduled departure time, however, the push back only started 30 minutes later. In the meantime no one from the crew gave any type of explanation. Also being in business class, it would be expectable to be given a drink before departure, but none was provided. The in flight meal was pretty good, but service extremely slow. The flight was conducted on an Airbus 321neo which is very comfortable and amazingly silent.

### "The flight was very nice"
Lisbon to Barcelona. The flight was slightly late and the boarding was a bit crowded. But this seems to be down to the airport being old, small, overcrowded. The flight was very nice. Most of the crew really seemed to enjoy what they were doing instead of just going through another task. The food they served - on a 90 min flight - was really good: couscous with chicken and mint wrap. And some other goodies.

### "They did not care"
Leaving from JFK to Copenhagen was a long wait to check in and no express for online check-in. The flight was pleasant the food was simple and not appealing but at least they feed us something. Seats in economy were very tight and I had expected it from what I read before. Seats on the plane lack comfort. However, its a new and very modern aircraft the A330 Neo. On my connection to Copenhagen, I transfer to a the A321. They fed us a light meal. The seats are basic and hard; I am 5, 9.5 in height and my knees were hitting the seat in front of me. Now this is the most something I had never seen before. In the entire cabin, seats don't recline. Its like at a 90 degree angle, and that is what I endured for 3 hours to Copenhagen. Come back Amsterdam to New York via Lisbon, the plane was delayed 1.5 hours and I missed my connection. Without my input they placed me on flight the following day (24) hours later. I miss a family graduation party. They did not care. Imagine, they told me that no flights were available to NYC. Why could they not put me on a different airline and send me home? They did not. I was told to a hotel next to the airport. I had to walk and pull my luggage. It is hard to find TAP agents to seek help throughout the airport. Also, the airport lack space and other updated infrastructure. They gave me food vouchers. I had to eat the same meals three times. Its a limited menu to chose from and confined to the hotel. This is how TAP handle this. After escalating the issue with a formal complain after I came home, NO help there, I was offered mileage or a travel voucher on TAP. This is after I cited EU laws that entitles me for financial compensations. Thus, I will have to deal with them again, and its fearful when you face problem and your airline is not easy to reach. And here I mean have to walk so far to find a TAP person or office to sort matters. TAP crew were wonderful and pleasant. The plane was clean and the entertainment was enough. I must add that even boarding from Amsterdam to Lisbon, there were only two TAP agents at check in. I waited one hour to check in. I was very annoyed. And it was here that the flight was delayed to Lisbon which caused my miss - connection to JFK.

### "luggage was not included"
Toronto to Lisbon. Spent $3,000 CND on 3 tickets bought about 6 months in advance. Checkin day came and they told me luggage was not included, so $150.00 per suitcase, each way, added $600.00 to the cost. Then they cancelled my son's ticket, forced me to purchase another ticket for $1,500. Now i'm up to $5,100.00. TAP refused to speak to me, told me it was the travel agency that cancelled the ticket, travel agency confirmed they had no reason to do so, TAP did. Try calling them, emailing them, worse experience ever. Needless to day, first and last time flying with this company.

### "TP 671 had been cancelled"
Amsterdam to Lisbon connection to Sao Paulo, in business class. On the date of departure, September 9th 2019, we arrived at Schiphol Amsterdam at 17:15 to board our flight, 2.30 hours prior to the scheduled departure and were going through the security barrier when we were informed that TP 671 had been cancelled. We were so surprised that we could not believe what we were hearing, and were advised to contact TAP representatives at the airport. Our absolute nightmare commenced on trying to do so, since we quickly learned thanks to a luggage porter, that TAP was only represented by a third party company SWISSPORT at Schiphol. We eventually got directed to the SWISSPORT customer service, and upon reaching it discovered we had over 150 people standing in a queue waiting to be attended to by only 2 lady clerks, we were duly informed we must line up behind all the rest of the customers in the line. Once it was our turn, our first question was why did TAP not contact us the travelers about this cancellation, to which we got the reply was “I cannot tell you, we just provide the service at the airport for TAP. The flight was cancelled due lack of crew” Why did TAP not reach out to the travelers prior to the flight to inform of the cancellation? At the SWISSPORT desk we were indicated by this rude clerk that we had been reprogrammed to depart the next morning at 07:00 AM to Lisbon on TP 669 and would connect on to Sao Paulo on TP 089, a 9.30 hours flight entirely performed during daylight. When these tickets were purchased over 10 months ago, we chose TP 87 flight as it was a night crossing over the Atlantic, which would also allow us to continue our journey within South America, since our final destination after Sao Paulo was Montevideo, Uruguay. Therefore all our flight connections were missed and we had to purchase entirely new tickets to our final destination after TAP Portugal dumped us

### "It's the worst airline"
Not Verified |  Helsinki to Lisbon. As a Gold Member I am entitled to check in one luggage for free at TAP. Even so they charged me 70 EUR. Now almost 2 months have passed after I filed the complain online to get the refund, and nobody has ever contacted me. I called already 2 times. No help whatsoever. The last time they asked me to prove legally that I am the one who is getting the refund! I provided paper. Silence! Again I called, tried it for more than 2 hours to get through the hotline to the customer centre without result! Nothing. Never ever again will I fly TAP. It's the worst airline in the world! The worst service ever I have seen. What service? There is no service.

### "Plane was brand new"
Lisbon to Newark. Great flight from beginning to end. Check-in was swift as was security and lounge was nicely appointed with a bartender making good drinks. Boarding was by bus which isn’t great but was ok. Plane was brand new. The seat was lie flat and very private and the screen was enormous. Plenty of film choices. Food excellent - canapés, soup, fish, main course, dessert. Crew were so-so - they need to smile more and be more engaging as the hard product is good.

### "best legroom I had ever had"
Before I took TAP, I had read reviews about how not great the airline was. So when I arrived in New York, I was worried about my flight to Lisbon. But once they started the check-in process at JFK, it was smooth sailing from there. The flight wasn't full and so the person sitting next to me was able to move to another seat, which gave me a whole row to myself. The legroom on the 330-900neo was great! The best legroom I had ever had on an international flight. The food was decent. Normal airline food and wine were good. We arrived in Lisbon early. My flight to Prague was a bit messier. As we were not at the jetbridge but we were on jet stairs. So that made boarding go by a little slower. We arrived later in Prague. The unloading of the bags took a long time but that was more on Prague ground crew then TAP.

### "our extreme disappointment"
London to Lisbon. As a first experience with TAP we wanted to advise everyone of our extreme disappointment. The two male cabin attendants on this flight in Business Class were VERY unwelcoming, very unprofessional and appeared angry & unhappy to be working. This made us feel very uncomfortable. We were not offered a welcome drink and a pre-packed refreshing towel was only offered after take-off. As we reached cruising altitude of the flight we were spoken to by the Flight Purser, who was a very nice man and completely the opposite of his crew, it seemed that the crew had complained of us taking photographs 'of them' which we were not doing. We were just photographing the cabin and food on board - both of which were also very disappointing - very poor in quality & quantity. The meal consisted of a few slices of cold meat, a poor salad and a Pastel de Nata. It felt like an economy meal rather than a premium cabin meal. The purser continued throughout the flight to make us as comfortable as possible and did agree with us on his crew and their attitudes displayed assuring us of his ability to grade them post flight. On our return flight  the crew were much more professional but some aspects were also extremely disappointing. The TAP Lounge in Lisbon airport T1 was closed for refurbishment but no alternative was offered for Premium fare paying passengers. Boarding was chaotic and the Food and Beverage offering was again, a very poor Cold Meat salad and despite having IFE on our outbound flight we had nothing offered on the inbound. All in-flight magazines on both sectors (if available) were of a poor condition, torn and creased. This was the pitiful response from TAP Customer Services;-  Thank you for contacting TAP Air Portugal. We are sorry for the situation you reported. Your comment will allow us to improve customer experience with our company. Please do not hesitate to contact us whenever you consider it relevant. We look forward to welcoming you on board soon.

### "they really don't care"
Valencia to Lisbon. Typical TAP flight: late for more than an hour due to the late arrival of the aircraft and lack of diligence on the airline's part for not making sure this situations won't happen. The annoying thing here is the fact they really don't care. Save your patience, fly with others. I had personal commitments which were seriously compromised.

### "one of the worst airlines"
Not Verified |  Porto to Toronto via Lisbon. TAP Portugal is one of the worst airlines I have flown on in a while! Great customer service but horrible fees. How is that I have to pay for everything? Seat selection, baggage. Also one of the ground agents in Porto  airport was extremely rude and sarcastic with me. Absolutely ridiculous. One of the worst ground service I have experienced and I am a frequent flyer

### "Everything has been lies after lies"
Not Verified |  On September 3 I had a flight at 4pm from Casablanca to Lisbon and then from Lisbon to Valencia. Both flights operated by Tap Air Portugal. At the door of the first plane from Casablanca, they changed my tickets for others, thus changing the numbers of the seats, which did not put any problem. When I arrived in Lisbon, at the door of the plane they told me that I had to wait for all the people to enter and then see if I could enter. I went with another friend of mine and they left us out. We have the flights purchased since June 27. And they told us there were no places for two more people. They told us that we had to spend the night in Lisbon and fly today, September 4, which we didn't want because we wanted to get to Valencia on day 3. They didn't give us more explanations and hurried us to get us on a flight that was going to Madrid , since it was the only solution. For Barcelona, ​​it was all full. The flight from Madrid had its scheduled departure at 9.40. They put us on the bus that goes to the plane and once seated on the bus came a boy from the company and told us that we should get off because the flight was canceled at the moment. We all had to go down and climb the stairs loaded with suitcases because we didn't know when we were going to fly. They told us that we had to stay there that night. They told us that at 9.40 they would give us more information, that information was that we would fly at 10.30. At that time (10.30) we were all sitting on the plane, and when we were going to take off, they told us that there were technical problems and that we could not return for the moment. We finally left at 12.30 at night. Arriving at 1.30 in Madrid and after waiting for our bags, ours were not. When we were in Lisbon and they changed our flights to go to Madrid, instead of going to Valencia, they told us that the bags would change them and they would go to Madrid with us. But when they arrived in Madrid they were not. And without further explanation, we were not given any solution to get to Valencia. We had to look for how to return to Valencia, at that time there were neither trains nor buses, and we stayed at the airport until catching a flight with Aireuropa that left at 7 in the morning. Flight we have paid from our pocket: € 135 each. We arrived in Valencia at 8.25 and there were also no suitcases. We still do not know anything about the bags, they do not give us explanations and they only gave us two vouchers: one with € 6 to use with food and another € 450 to use with your company, which we will not do again after the treatment received. In Lisbon they told us that this money would be in cash, and not for their company. Everything has been lies after lies. We hope justice is done because these things cannot be done. ES: Ayer día 3 de septiembre tenía un vuelo a las 4pm desde Casablanca a Lisboa y luego de Lisboa a Valencia. Ambos vuelos operados por Tap Air Portugal. A la puerta del primer avión desde Casablanca, me cambiaron los billetes por otros, así cambiando los números de los asientos, cosa que no puse ningún problema. Cuando llegué a Lisboa, a la puerta del avión me dijeron que me tenía que esperar a que entrara toda la gente y luego ver si yo podía entrar. Yo iba con otra amiga mía y nos dejaron fuera. Tenemos los vuelos comprados desde el 27 de Junio. Y nos dijeron que no habían sitios para dos personas más. Nos dijeron que teníamos que pasar la noche en Lisboa y volar hoy, día 4 de Septiembre, cosa que no queríamos porque queríamos llegar a Valencia el día 3. No nos dieron más explicaciones y nos daban prisa para ponernos en un vuelo que iba a Madrid, ya que era la única solución. Para Barcelona, estaba todo lleno. El vuelo de Madrid tenía su salida prevista a las 9.40. Nos pusieron en el autobús que va al avión y una vez sentados en el autobús vino un chico de la compañia y nos dijo que debíamos de bajar porque el vuelo estaba cancelado de momento. Tuvimos que bajar todos y subir las escaleras cargados de maletas porque no sabíamos cuando íbamos a volar. Nos dijeron que alomejor teníamos que quedarnos esa noche allí. Nos dijeron que a las 9.40 nos darían más información, esa información fue que volaríamos a las 10.30. A esa hora(10.30) ya estabamos todos sentados en el avión, y cuando ibamos a despegar, nos dijeron que habían problemas técnicos y que no podíamos volsr de momento. Salimos finalmente a las 12.30 de la noche. Llegando a la 1.30 a Madrid y después de esperar a las maletas, las nuestras no estaban. Cuando estuvimos en Lisboa y nos cambiaron los vuelos para ir a Madrid, en vez de ir a Valencia, nos dijeron que las maletas las iban a cambiar de avión y irian a Madrid con nosotras. Pero al llegar a Madrid no estaban. Y sin más explicaciones, no nos pusieron ninguna solución para llegar a Valencia. Nos tuvimos que buscar como volver a Valencia, a esas horas no habían ni trenes ni autobuses, y nos quedamos en el aeropuerto hasta coger un vuelo con aireuropa que salía a las 7 de la mañana. Vuelo que hemos pagado de nuestro bolsillo: 135€ cada uno. Hemos llegado a Valencia a las 8.25 y allí tampoco estaban las maletas. Seguimos sin saber nada de las maletas, no nos dan explicaciones y solamente nos dieron dos vales: uno con 6€ para utilizar con comida y otro de 450€ para utilizar con su compañia, cosa que no vamos a volver a hacer después del trato recibido. En Lisboa nos dijeron que ese dinero sería en efectivo, y no para su compañia. Todo han sido mentiras tras mentiras. Esperamos que se haga justicia porque no se pueden hacer estas cosas.

### "airline doesn’t give a damn"
Not Verified |  Oslo to Madrid via Lisbon. 2 delays in 24 hours. This airline doesn’t give a damn about passengers - one hour delay gates doesn’t appear until 55 min before boarding and when you go to the boarding gate you're gonna wait another hour to the final check and finally pray that they'll not put you inside the bus and leave in there under the sun for another hour before entering the plane like it happened to me.

### "Terrible customer service"
TAP cancelled my outgoing flight without giving any notice at all. Because I went in to select a seat, I noticed one leg was cancelled and replaced by a flight 7 hours earlier. I missed half a day of work having to leave earlier. Luckily I could still actually go. I filed a complaint for EU compensation which they relatively quickly agreed to. However since then I have heard nothing for almost 4 months. Repeated contact with customer service only results in standard answer, and no 3 weeks without response at all. Terrible customer service. I don’t trust them for a second trip after this, ever.

### "a very pleasant experience"
Not Verified |  Toronto to Lisbon. My wife and I booked our tickets to Portugal early this year. In late July, before flying with TAP (in August) I decided to come to this website to see the reviews. To my dismay, they were pretty dreadful. I was pretty anxious and frankly really second guessing my decision. But what could we do the tickets were booked. I wanted to let people know however that we had a very pleasant experience with TAP. The staff were friendly. The plane was very clean. Sure the cabin was mighty chilly (extra blankets were cheerfully provided) and the food wasn't anything to write home about (I've flown numerous times over many decades, and most airline food is poor - so this is no surprise). But, and I must emphasize this - the overall experience on both outward and return flights was absolutely fine. It is for this reason that I was determined to counter balance some of the more alarming reviews I had read. Something that I thought that TAP did well with was calling out those folks who had no carry on bags to store in the overhead bins first (before regular boarding begins). This ensured that folks with carry-on could find space. This was something that worked very well and eased the anxiety of many. The seats were modern and the inflight system pretty darn good. This was an international flight and I can't speak for domestic routes or routes in and around Europe. But for those who have booked Toronto to Lisbon, the flight was fine.

### "definitely be my last with them"
I flew in business from Sao Paulo to Milan via Lisbon. My bags got lost somewhere on the way and in Milan they have no representatives, so clearly they use a handler. The fact that I flew in business did not make any difference at all when it comes to service, I was not given contact details regarding getting updates on my bags, nor contact about how to get reimbursement for the money spent while we are without luggage. I called many numbers I found online, but I was never able to speak to anyone responsible for the luggage/lost and found services. I contacted them on Twitter and they said "we'll let you know, we'll let you know..." As of today, I haven't received any update, I'm now back in Australia and no one of TAP has been in touch with me, my whole trip to Italy has been without luggage. This is by far the worst experience I have ever had with an airline, or in general with a company, the fact they can afford not to speak to anyone and give any update, and still have people spending money with them, is amazing and worrying at the same time. This was my first time, and it will definitely be my last with them. They will hear from my lawyer.

### "Poor customer service"
Lisbon to Chicago. I paid to select a window and aisle seat but was reassigned middle seats on this flight. It seemed reasonable that TAP would refund this cost, but they were hard to contact, slow to respond and eventually informed me that paying for a seat selection is no guarantee that I would get the seats that were selected. Poor customer service is the best way to describe how they handled this easy to fix situation.

### "Avoid this airline"
Marrakesh to Munich via Lisbon. To make it short: Avoid this airline for delays and related issues! On my way to RAK, TP outbound flight MUC-LIS was delayed so that I couldn’t get my connecting flight LIS to RAK. Luckily the friendly handling agency rebooked me with LH via MAD and IB to RAK. I wanted to give TP a second chance with my return flight RAK-LIS-MUC. Flight RAK-LIS delayed by 1.5h due to late inbound flight. Could catch the connecting flight in LIS to MUC with running but my luggage got stuck in LIS. Not to mention that my flight LIS-MUC was delayed as well Apart from notorious delays nice inflight Service with good food on European services in Business and pretty new aircraft (0.4 years old A320 neocon LIS-MUC. Overall- avoid this airline especially with short connecting time in LIS. Consider everything below 2hrs as short.

### "worst flight experience"
Faro to Lisbon. TAP Portugal  is hands down worst flight experience I have ever had. They cancelled our flight day of without a notice email or phone call and when asked what is the next step they had zero information for us. We spend an hour at our airport trying to figure out what was going one without any help or explanation! We decided to take a taxi from Faro air port to Lisbon to catch our connecting flight back to Toronto. This cost us 400 Euro ( we were told airline would reimburse us for this cost!! hasn't happened yet) once we arrived to Lisbon we checked our bags and printed off our tickets for flight to Toronto and were denied entry into boarding area because the tickets that were printed were for the next day and not our day of travel! TAP decided to go ahead and cancel our original flight and sell off our seats once again without notice or permission!!! We had to jump through hoops to manage to get back onto our original flight and did so just in time. The whole time we were being told there was no room on flight and we would have to take the flight the next day. We refused to accept this and finally got onto our flight. To add insult to injury once on our flight we noticed at least 8 to 10 empty seats in our section of plane ( not sure why they told us there was no room) I assume TAP likes to cancel peoples flights and then sell off original seats to other passengers for additional upgrade cost. Once we arrived to Toronto airport after our worst day of travel ever, we found out our luggage was not on our flight and was now lost! This airline and it's employees were horrible to deal with, zero help at any point of our travels. We were handed complaint cards with an e-mail address on it and told to contact it when we got home and we would be reimbursed for everything. Well we have been home for 2 weeks now and have yet to receive any compensation for any of their mistakes and I have sent over 8 complaint e-mails and only one was replied back too offering me a voucher for a small amount towards a flight with their airline that can be used only within the next year. This is not the reimbursement we were promised by TAP staff in the airports, we were told we would get full cash compensation. No TAP staff has replied back to me now in over 6 days.

### "Worst flying experience"
Ponta Delgada to Madrid via Lisbon. Worst flying experience in my life. Flight from Madrid to Lisbon delayed more than 2 hours and lost the second flight to Azores. Queuing for 6 hours at TAP counter just to be offered a flight to Azores two days later. Hotel in Lisbon booked and paid on my own for those two nights. They just said to upload the receipts in their website and they would review it. In Lisbon I couldn't even get my baggage since they lost it. The following day, in Lisbon, I had to go back to the airport to pick up my baggage, queued and waited for over 6 hours just to be told that they had lost it. Went back to TAP counter and the man there started yelling and shouting at me saying he had no idea about lost baggage. Shouting at a customer is something I had never seen in my whole life. Finally the baggage arrived in Azores 4 days later. The flight to Azores was also delayed more than one hour. Flight back from Azores delayed more than 2 hours and lost again the second flight to Madrid. They offered me a new flight on the same day at 21.40, which was finally delayed more than 1.5 hours. It takes more time to go to Japan than to Azores.

### "behaving as a low cost airline"
London to Lisbon. I'm writing this review even before flying as my experience so far as already not great, and I just only check in. Hope the rest of journey will be more pleasant. I use to fly with TAP always as I moved from portugal to the uk, as my country airline. I stopped few years ago and feel made a mistake buying this fortunately one way ticket. TAP is now behaving as a low cost airline, but with no low cost prices! Tickets are expensive to start with and then you have to pay for bag or buy even more expensive ticket to include a bag. I knew and ok. Now at check in I could change my seat without paying extra - one if reason I had stop as we stop being able to book before check but at least we could change the seat for free at check in. Now it is only paying and not cheap either even for less wanted seats! At finishing check in I see that I can not have a boarding pass either - not available to add to your phone app. I am told I need to go waste my time and damage the environment more by having to collect/ print in paper the boarding pass at airport! Overall so far it is a disappointment. Just hope I don't have more reasons to regret it tomorrow. I will again stop flying TAP. They need to decide if they are low cost than behave totally as one and lower basic air ticket prices!

### "Nightmare from start"
Porto to Milan. Nightmare from start. Single check in line at Porto with two open counters for any flight in a busy European summer early morning flights. The girl at the counter had no idea how to do any operations on their system. Also, for the first time in my life my bag got lost. It did not board the plane, due to a check in error by the same person that did not received proper training. At Milan did a formal complain with the ground personnel which confirmed the bag was still at Oporto, there was 2 flights available the same day shall get to me same day. Also called Tap straight away same answer. Hours go by no notifications. Decide to call again Tap, after 20 mins waiting, they now do not know where the baggage is any more, it disappeared. 1 Week in the Mediterranean coast supposed to be a dream turn into a nightmare. No clothes, no phone chargers, my partner make-up and hair care gone. No money compensation. No apologies. No communication. I travel for work a lot, all around the world with more than 20 intercontinental flights a year, I am a Qantas Platinium never in my life experience so bad customer service and management. Definitely need to train their employees better. The problem was pretty easy to solve 4 direct flights within 24 hours between the same destinations... Nothing happened. Every call a different employee telling me something different. To avoid flying with. Just check how many baggage complains you find here.

### "They need to step up their game"
Cabin crew looked tired and miserable as if they were being forced to work, without the usual friendly demeanour. For the rest, it was an uneventful flight with a delay at departure, typical of TAP. Nice wrap with an arabic touch: chicken, couscous and mint. They need to step up their game if they really want to be an European player in aviation. For the more than 400 hundred euros I paid for these domestic flights of an hour and thirty minutes I expected much more.

### "been deeply disappointed"
If you are flying from Africa, please avoid this terrible airline. They will ill-treat you as if you were nothing. I booked a ticket for my wife through Priceline and Lisbon was her first destination. There was no mention of a nonsense and strict one-bag policy on her ticket and until she made it to the airport, only to discover that she would not be allowed to travel with her second bag. She wanted to pay extra for her second bag but in vain. I called TAP Air Portugal's customer service and was placed on hold the entire time without a positive end to the issue. I have been deeply disappointed. Neither I nor any of my family member will ever fly this bad airline.

### "Good meal served"
Vienna to Lisbon. Perfect for boarding, 20 minutes late departure, recovered during the flight. Very good assistance on board, the crew very courteous and attentive to every small request. Good meal served, quality wines also offered. Landing on time. Perfetti all'imbarco, 20 minuti di ritardo la partenza, recuperati durante il volo. Assistenza a bordo molto buona, il personale di bordo molto cortese ed attento ad ogni più piccola richiesta. Buono il pasto servito, di qualità anche i vini proposti. Atterraggio in orario.

### "passport not within 90 day expiration"
Newark to Lisbon. When we arrived at Newark airport to TAP for check in we were informed our daughters passport was not within the 90 day expiration date, and could not board the flight. The complaint i have is when i contacted TAP right when this incident occurred, they said basically, sorry there is nothing we can do for you. I asked if they can credit us another flight, and they said no, you will lose your money. This 90 day expiration should be on bookings as a reminder/ notification especially for those who dont travel often. Needless to say, I'm here just to vent in ultimate disappointment for our lost family trip. I didnt get to travel with TAP, this is for review of their customer service in the above mentioned situation. Our passports were valid and within expiration at the time of travel.

### "choose more trustworthy airline"
Not Verified |  Lisbon to Boston. Paid the extra charge To choose our seats. Chose our seats upon ticketing (2 couples, 2 window and 2 adjacent seats) and for which we have receipts. Tap moved 1 person into the middle of the plane and gave the window seat to someone else. Same thing that i have seen in other reviews that “the plane changes sometime”. Spoke with flight attendant and was told we could apply for refund of the seat charges since we didn’t get the ones we chose. Provided receipts and boarding passes clearly showing the switch and customer service (or lack there of) insisted We were given the same “configuration”. What? You made the couple sit apart! Paying extra to choose your seats means nothing to them - you may or may not Get what you paid for! Beware and choose another more trustworthy airline! The best part is the window seat was given to an obese and rude and smelly man.

### "does not care about customers"
Porto to Newark via Lisbon. I booked a flight for a family vacation to Portugal. On the way back my trip included a connecting flight in Lisbon. I would be traveling from Porto and connecting in Lisbon before traveling to NY. Months after booking the flight I found I would be closer to Lisbon when ending my trip and requested to cancel the connection and fly out from Lisbon on my prebooked flight directly. I was told this would be a new ticket and fare prices are different and to make the change I would need to pay over $800.00. I spoke to several people and no one would put me in touch with a manger. I could not believe they would charge that much money for me to board in Lisbon instead of Porto. TAP does not care about customers. I will never again fly this airline and urge you to avoid it at all costs

### "the worst flight experience"
London City to Lisbon. By far the worst flight experience I've ever had. 30 minutes after our flight was supposed to leave, ground staff explained that the flight was "full" which meant that they couldn't fly everyone directly to Lisbon. Ground staff then asked all the passengers sat in the departure gate whether we'd prefer to leave all passengers currently on "Standby" (even though they actually had a seat), at the airport, so that we could fly directly. Alternatively, we could take everyone, which would mean we would need to stop in Nantes, France to refuel and incur an unconfirmed delay. I think it's absolutely absurd that we were expected to make such a decision for them?! When on our second journey, there was absolutely no confirmation of when we were expected to land, just regular updates on the speed of the plane and altitude (not sure what help this was). When I asked the flight attendant how long she thought it might take to get through the airport on arrival (I had a hire car waiting and a hotel to check in) she laughed and asked how I thought she might be able to tell her this. Added to this, the food was disgusting and beverages half full. Will be avoiding TAP Portugal at all costs in future.

### "don't even seem to bother anymore"
Madrid to Lisbon. TAP is totally unapologetic and shameless about not sticking to schedules. They don't even seem to bother anymore. Catering is lacking minimal creativity or effort and their hub is a world known disgrace. Plane was dirty. Now choose if you want to fly with a company like that.

### "outrageous last minute extra baggage fee"
Porto to Zurich with TAP Portugal, connecting to Calgary from Zurich with Edelweiss Air. On June 20/19 my husband & I were charged an outrageous "last minute extra baggage fee" of 250 Euros per person to fly our bikes back to Canada compared to the 110 Euros/bike advertised on TAP's website. We were shocked to learn when we arrived at the airport that we were supposed to "reserve" the bikes 36 hours in advance. There is nothing on TAP's website or online check-in information re: travelling with bicycles that communicates this yet there is very specific and detailed information about how to pack your bike. When we checked in online we tried to pay for our luggage/bikes (as we did with Air Canada for the flight over to Portugal) but TAP's communication only says "contact the Contact Centre or TAP desk to ensure sports equipment is registered correctly indicating weight & dimensions. This is far too vague and certainly isn't clear and explicit that this is required to avoid a very punitive last minute extra baggage fee. This reservation requirement is not standard practice among airlines (and we've flown at least 12 different airlines over the years with our bikes). The weight & dimensions of bikes must be confirmed by airline staff at check-in anyway (why would the airline simply accept verbal communication?). It is the airlines responsibility to clearly communicate the requirement to reserve bikes in advance and the consequences of not doing so. Our request for a partial refund of the difference has been denied twice. Clearly TAP is not accepting responsibility for inadequate website communication and poor business practice. As such we can only conclude that this an opportunistic cash grab by the airline which takes advantage of unsuspecting travellers / cyclists who have never flown TAP before.

### "Overall, a poor experience"
Not Verified |  Overall, a poor experience. TAP Portugal is attempting to capture trans-Atlantic traffic, but the infrastructure in Lisbon is completely unprepared to handle the load. If you chose this airline, be ready for 3+ hours standing in line at immigration. Trans-Atlantic planes cannot access the terminal directly, so they park 20-30 minutes away and you get to crowd onto a bus for the trip. If you don’t mind the lines and the waiting, you can pay $500-1000 for an upgrade but if you fly economy, don’t expect to find luggage space left overhead by the time you board. Terminal staff do not bother to police the queues, so everyone cheats and boards early, taking up all the overhead with purses and small bags. Overall, a poor experience. Will not do that again.

### "delayed 7.5 hours"
Not Verified |  Chicago to Lisbon. Awful. They knew the day before that our flight would be delayed 7.5 hours and didn't send out a notice about it until 3 hours before the original take off time. Also I called to pre check luggage and the customer service rep never followed through so I ended up paying an extra 30 dollars at the airport to check a bag.

### "unprofessional and discourteous"
Lisbon to Newark. On June 15, 2019, I purchased two seats on a TAP Portugal flight from Lisbon to Newark, for which I paid $84. According to the seat, map displayed, I choose the two seats, aisle and middle to get more leg room, as the row the two seats were situated was shown behind the divider separating the two economy sections. Upon arrival in the airplane on June 22, I realized the two seats were in the middle of one of the economy sections and not the seats displayed of the seat map a week prior when I purchased them. Even more, they were two of the worst seats possible, squeezed in the middle of the aircraft, seats that I could have gotten for free at check-in. I immediately talked with the ﬂight attendant about this and was told to contact TAP Portugal for a refund as airplanes change often and so do the seat charts. Of course, three weeks have passed, and not only I didn't get a refund, but I also didn't even get any response or apology from TAP Portugal. I would also like to add that the ﬂying TAP Portugal was a very unpleasant experience (and this is as nice as I can say it) that ended with a layover of 15 hours in Newark. I purchased these tickets in November 2018 and was notiﬁed in March 2019 that the last ﬂight, EWR to CHS has been cancelled. I've contacted Expedia and TAP Portugal numerous times for ten weeks without getting any resolutions in this matter. Two days prior to the departure, the only option oﬀered was a ﬂight with a layover of 15 hours. Although I recognize that this was the responsibility of Expedia, through which I've purchased the tickets, I was informed by Expedia on countless occasions, that TAP Portugal would not respond to their numerous inquiries. I ﬁnd the entire experience with TAP Portugal to be unprofessional and discourteous.

### "keep serving the same disgusting wrap"
Lisbon to Funchal with TAP Portugal. They keep serving the same disgusting wrap on almost every flight. Check-in process at Lisbon airport is very complex for anyone less tecnhologically savy: you have to print your bag tickets and then stick them, I find this very hard because there are some code barrs which you should stick onto your boarding pass, others in the bag while the lady receiving the bags was very condoscending and just made you feel ignorant.

### "received no notification from TAP"
TAP was responsible for the worst travel experience I have had in 27 years of frequent flying. I was booked YYZ-LIS-CMN, all on TAP metal, purchased via an Aeroplan ticket (Air Canada’s frequent flyer program). The debacle began when TAP canceled its YYZ-LIS flight on 26 June. Since their mobile app clearly has not been updated since 1997, I received no notification from TAP about the cancelation (despite having enrolled in email and SMS updates) and only found out about the delay by proactively checking the flight status. I initially called Aeroplan to rebook me on an alternative routing because I had a (correct) premonition that TAP’s call centre agents would be useless. However, Aeroplan are only able to rebook if there are points tickets available, and for same-day travel this is naturally next to impossible. Ultimately, they advised me to call TAP. After waiting on hold for an infuriating 30 minutes, we finally reached an agent who advised us that due to the flight cancelation we would be reprotected on a new flight that TAP was “kind enough” to send the following day, departing at 6 pm. At our final destination in CMN, we were to start on a 7-day prepaid tour of Morocco, so a delay of 24h would be unacceptable. We explained this extenuating circumstance to the TAP agent and he did not even attempt to look for alternative routing. He simply said “sorry”, he would not even escalate to a supervisor. When he realized it was an Aeroplan ticket, he said he could not touch our tickets anyway and he would transfer us to the airline miles department. Ready to try anything at this point (even though it was not on TAP miles), we accepted the proposal. When the hostile Miles agent picked up, he made it clear that he could not assist since it was an Aeroplan, not a Miles&Go ticket. We asked to be transferred back to a main ticketing agent without a 30-minute queue, but of course he just shoved us back into the queue anyway. When we finally reached another agent, she was no more helpful. She drew the same conclusion that since it was an Aeroplan ticket, I ought to speak to the Miles&Go department, despite my pleas that she figure it out as Miles&Go could not help, she cut me off and transferred me anyway — making it clear that this is just a shameless tactic to deflect a difficult call and keep average handle times down. Ultimately Aeroplan agreed to rebook us on AC’s YYZ-LIS flight the same night and told me they did so because TAP had violated its passenger contract of carriage and refused to reprotect me on any flight — unbelievable. The next leg of my journey (LIS-CMN) was still on TAP metal. The AC agent in YYZ was unable to print boarding passes for that flight and advised we pick them up in LIS. When we arrived, the TAP debacle continued. There was not a single agent manning the TAP transfers desk in the international terminal, so we approached an agent at a boarding counter for a flight that had just closed. She was visibly annoyed that we asked for help but when we pointed out the deserted transfers desk she obliged. When she looked into the file, she found that we were not confirmed on the LIS-CMN leg! Her suggestion, naturally, was to call Aeroplan, who once again came to the rescue: they cited TAP as again having shirked their responsibilities to guarantee us on the second flight (whatever that means) and repurchased the two tickets out of pocket so we could be confirmed. I just cannot believe how TAP can be so shady.

### "truly soul destroying"
A stain on the face of Portugal. Poor service - unprecedented delays - unscheduled tech stop - undeclared via destination for disembarkation and embarkation - lost bags - no priority for business passengers. I’ve never seen so many disinterested ground crew. Families with children then general boarding. No control whatsoever. - over the course of a disjointed 8 hour flight we received a glass of water during the 80 minute delay on tarmac, then nothing for the next 3 hours of flight time. One (single solitary) drinks service with food, then nothing for another 4 hours when we landed in Accra. The crew had run out of water, beer, white wine and juice after just one offering. Nothing further was available. - 8 flights in 14 days, only one keeping within 30 minutes of schedule. Cumulative 28 hour delay across the others. - A320 single aisle aircraft on trans-continental that doesn’t have fuel capacity for the route. Sadly the cabin crew, transfer team etc openly admit that this is the case with an estimated 50% of TAP flights. I hate it when people say this - however, I really have flown some 40 airlines in my time (economy, premium, business, first) and have had several shoddy experiences but I have made a personal pledge that I will never set foot on a TAP aircraft ever again. It’s truly soul destroying.

### "Amazing service, crew and food2
Lisbon to Dusseldorf. Amazing service, crew and food. Very personal service, clean aircraft and the food were amazing for a 2.5-hour flight. Could not have wished for anything more. It was a really cheap flight and competitors like KLM or LH were 4x the price and TAPs service was comparable if not better!

### "Extremely rude staff"
Not Verified |  Lisbon to London. Extremely rude staff who demanded we check our hand luggage in. We deliberately booked not to check our luggage due to time constraints but were forced to check it in despite it meeting the bag requirements. This delayed us - the woman on duty was extremely rude - the fact that the flight was overbooked was the fault of the airline but she made it seem it was our fault and we were penalised. Another told us that our hand luggage would be given priority and therefore offloaded first. This was not true. The overhead compartments had room to accommodate more carry-ons. This was handled extremely badly and those of us who were delayed (the flight was late departing by about 1 hr, too). If the airline has made a mistake and overbooked, we should not have to be rudely bullied into checking in our luggage. Instead of persuading us or giving us an incentive, we were giving marching orders rudely rather than treated like passengers.

### "Horrendous service"
Not Verified |  Newark to Accra via Lisbon. Horrendous service with this airline. Paid $2,500 for 2 intercontinental round trip tickets from New Jersey To Accra. A day before the flight they let us know that no checked bags are included! Who does that? We were told it would be $92 per checked bag each way so a for 2 bags for 2 passengers that would $736 extra. But as if that wasn't bad enough when we actually went to check in online 24 hours before the flight the price had changed to $120 per bag each way. Which is an extra $1,000 for two checked bags when every other airline gives 2 free checked bags. In addition, all the people I spoke to on their customer service line were exceptionally rude and condescending. I've never received such terrible service.

### "On board service was efficient"
New York JFK to Rome via Lisbon. From check-in to luggage delivery, everything went smoothly. Luggage came out very fast in Rome and virtually I walked from the gate to the carousel and waited <5 mins and I was able to walk out of the airport. JFK-LIS sector: Only downside is that there is no lounge at JFK. On board service was efficient. Dinner service began right after airborne. Food was tasty and pasteis de nata was served as dessert, which was a nice Portuguese touch. By the time the first in-flight movie was done, the dinner table was cleared as well. Was able to sleep a solid 3 hours on lie-flat seat which was comfortable. Amenity kits was sufficient if not fancy. The morning breakfast service was a light meal instead of full breakfast and which was sufficient as had dinner a little over 3 hours ago. LIS-FCO sector: It was delayed a little over an hour which were not communicated until close the actual boarding time. Nice snack was served on board. All in all it was a nice journey.

### "horrendous customer service"
Not Verified |  Alicante to Amsterdam via Lisbon. Absolutely horrendous customer service and website! I've flown TAP multiple times in the past. I have no issues with the flights, the food or any of these other variables. Flights have generally run normally as other airlines. However, every time I get into a small issue, I can never fix it. Most recently I attempted (am still attempting) to buy a ticket and instead of saying my card was declined and telling me to try again, the website said "Booking confirmed, card did not work, call this number to pay". Stupid me decided to call instead of scrapping that reservation and doing another one. It's been 4 days on the phone and I still haven't managed to pay for this reservation. I've tried cards (over the phone - which I should not have done!!!) and most recently was told I could pay via invoice. I was promised to receive an invoice 2 days ago which still hasn't come. When I call Customer Service, I select "Payments" but always end up in "General Assistance" which cannot process my payments and thus have to redirect me to payments, which usually means hours on the phone. Also, they always take 5-10 minutes to find my reservation, which for some reason, I can find online in a few seconds. But why didn't you just scrap this reservation and buy a new one? Well, of course, since I entered the black hole, prices have gone up significantly, and I am not willing to pay the current price for the trip. And yes, I'm on the phone as I write this.

### "worst airline ever"
Gatwick to Accra via Lisbon. This is the worst airline ever. I booked for my 75yr old mum who asked for a wheel chair because she couldn't walk at the airport and this horrible airline was insisting that she walks because she did not arrange for wheelchair. Secondly, I booked through a 3rd party because of bad prior experience with TAP Portugal and my mum was stranded at the airport because TAP Portugal claimed she did not book after I had confirmed booking with TAP Portugal  2 times prior her travel date.

### "terrible customer service"
11.15hrs flight from Faro to Lisbon (45mins), flight cancelled by airline 45 mins before departure, no one from TAP at the gate to give advice, 2 staff from “ GroundForce” handling agents then had to deal with 165 passengers, many with connections from Lisbon onwards. TAP call centre still says flight is operational just delayed while TAP online says cancelled, passengers rebooked one by one on alternative flights 2 and 6 hours later, 2 hour process to rebook and a further 30 mins to get vouchers for food (Euro 24). Handling agents did the best they could but no TAP representative at the gate to face the music, terrible customer service. To note, many budget airlines service Faro, all seemed to be on time and have airline reps at the gate. TAP, if you want to play in the big league and boast about all your new connections to the USA it is time to lift your game. Yes, flights get delayed but don’t send 3rd party reps to do your dirty work, it has taken 8 hours from check in for a 40 min flight.

### "do not expect compensation"
Faro to Zurich via Lisbon. My flight from Faro to Lisbon on 4th December 2018 was delayed. In consequence, I missed my flight on the same day from Lisbon to Geneva on the same day and had to stay in Lisbon until the 5th of December. I missed a full day of work and had other costs resulting from this delay. On receiving my baggage on the 5th of December in Geneva I noticed that my bag was torn open. Since this incidence 8 months I have sent multiple complaints by email, whereby I attached all the necessary documents and pictures. In addition I have called at least 5 times to inquire about the status of my complaint. Each time I was asked to be patient. My patience has run out.I have encountered many problems in relation to flying but never filed a complaint. I have been consistently ignored by TAP for the last 8 months in a case which is absolutely clear. If you fly TAP do not expect any kind of compensation if something does not go well.

### "staff at gate very unpleasant"
Lisbon to London. This is my 4th flight and the last - thank god. Both times at Lisbon airport, the staff at the gate are very unpleasant to deal with. Just now I was waiting, the check in pressure me to check my hand luggage. Even though I told them that this is not the first time. Avoid

### "pretty shabby experience"
Not Verified |  London to Lisbon. A330 doing a short euro routing in business class and the seats were fine for a 2hr hop to Lisbon but I'd not want to do a long haul overnight flight, seats were way too narrow for me. No entertainment on screens at all, not even route map, crew told me that TAP are not allowed to have any IFE on European routes? Major problem was booking economy flights (not cheap) then purchasing specific seats, purchasing baggage and then bidding for a business class upgrade on the TAP website. Bids both outbound and inbound were accepted but whereas TAP provide for free seat reservations and baggage in Executive Class, they refused to give me a refund for either seats or baggage after my upgrade bids were accepted - they said I could transfer my seat reservation fees to another TAP flight within 12 months. TAP relied on rather vague general terms and conditions, stating that the fare rules of the class you purchased apply even in the event of an upgrade, to refuse a refund. Pretty poor since those T&C's generally relate to itinerary changes/cancellations/pax changes etc. Seems TAP are happy to accept lots of paid add ons to a basic fare and then refuse to accept that the bid for a successful upgrade should cancel all of this out and a refund given. I'm not a frequent flyer with TAP and will be even less frequent after this pretty shabby experience. Once bitten, twice shy, I'd never book seats or baggage again if I was going to bid for Executive Class, but probably not on this route and I'm unlikely to want to fly with them long haul. Word of caution, TAP use the Star Alliance Lounge in LHR - lovely. The TAP lounge in Lisbon is nice, great food etc but is super crowded mid afternoon and the views of the apron are not as good as the ANA lounge next door.

### "Most unhelpful airline"
Not Verified |  Lisbon to Ponta Delgada. Most unhelpful airline I’ve experienced. So upset I can’t even begin to explain. Don’t fly with them if you wish to have helpful people getting you on a flight on time. Also don’t trust the “online check in”. Save your money and time and do not use this airline.

### "Uneventful flight"
Lisbon to Frankfurt. Uneventful flight. As it often happens, the flight was a slightly late, but we caught up on the way. Staff were nice and food was was OK, I do miss the little juice bottles and the Portuguese "salame" cake, though! Check on was nice and swift too.

### "No welcome drink"
Berlin to Lisbon. We pre selected our business class seats on our flight and when we got on the airplane it was not set up as was selected online when selecting the seats, there were no business class seats. They had economy seats with a little more space. No special treatment at all. At check in they switched your seat assignments and then you find out why. Would never spend a dime on upgrades with this airline. No welcome drink.

### "TAP Portugal has been an absolute disaster"
This was an international flight and what was supposed to be a enjoyable vacation with my girlfriend turned into a nightmare within the first 24 hours. The flight was scheduled to depart from Miami on Friday and arrive in Madrid at 8.35 am, with a layover in Lisbon. According to the pilot, although we were boarded and on the plane in Miami at the correct time, we were delayed about 45 minutes because we were “waiting for a flight plan”. Mind you, the plane was originally scheduled to land in Lisbon in the morning at 5.20 am, with the connecting flight to Madrid leaving only an hour later at 6.20 am. Even without the delay, it would have been damn near impossible to get to that connecting flight before they closed the doors. We had to exit the plane outside of a gate and catch a bus to the terminal, then go through passport check and then go through another round of security. There was no way we would have been able to get through that in time to make the flight, so therefore they sold us an impossible connecting flight. Do not purchase a ticket with a connecting flight with TAP Portugal. Even 30 minutes before we arrived, we politely spoke to flight attendants about our situation and asked if people catching that flight to Madrid could exit the plane first in order to make it on time. The flight attendants were rude and replied that we would have to deal with that problem with the airport employees when we land. Once we landed, because of the delay, there was no time to get to our connecting flight and there were several others (and I mean several as in 20+) on the same plane that also missed their connecting flights, causing a chaos upon arrival of people scrambling to get flights changed. It wasn’t until 8.50 am, 3 hours after landing, that we were serviced and put on a new flight to Madrid. Let me also inform you that we had scheduled and bought a non-refundable, non-exchangable train ride from Madrid at 3.30, which cost us $200. The plan was to spend the morning in Madrid and then head to Barcelona that afternoon. The agent was able to give us a new flight to Madrid, however it was boarding when she informed us this was going to be our new flight so we had to run across the terminal to catch the flight! Before we ran to our gate, we asked the agent if our bags were going to make it and she replied “Yes they will.” We asked her if she was sure and she replied “Yes. I am working on that now.” So we get on the 9.20 flight only to get to Madrid and find out that our bags did not make it on board. Our checked bags had all of our clothing and toiletries inside so now we’re in a foreign country with nothing but the clothes on our backs and our personal items which only contained things like electronics and school work (me and my girlfriend are students). At this point my girlfriend is crying and we are only informed that our bags may get delivered to our hotel. There was no promise on when nor whether it would actually happen, leaving us anxious. Traveling with TAP Portugal has been an absolute disaster and it was my girlfriend's first time traveling overseas. Their employees were rude, the scheduling/planning was unorganized, and there seemed to be nobody willing to help our situation.

### "no legroom at all"
27 minutes late. Was seated at the very back of the plane, no legroom at all. Flight attendant very rispidly told me to seat down, in front of all passengers, while I was trying to take a blanket as the cabin was freezing cold. There was an emergency on board and the cabin crew acted professionally.

### "Chaotic bus boarding"
Lisbon to Funchal. Chaotic bus boarding of the plane with elderly passengers entering the aircraft at the front door but being seated at the back of the plane while passengers boarding through the back were mostly seated at the front seats. Operated by an Aigle Azur aircraft.

### "mostly good because of Portugalia"
Madrid - Lisbon,  Porto-Lisbon-Faro and then Lisbon to Madrid. The international flights were in their A321 planes, which have non reclining seats and poor legroom. They are very punctual, the staff is nice and helpful, their pilots are excellent. Meals are under average. The domestic flights between Porto, Lisbon and Faro were with Portugalia, which is a totally different story. The flights were on Embraer E-195 planes, upholstered, reclining seats with large legroom, two abreast, great service, staff is really nice, pilots great, above average meals and snacks. The points awarded in this review are mostly good because of Portugalia.

### "Don't use this airline"
Don't use this airline! I paid for a seat for my daughter to fly from Rome to Newark. She received emails to confirm her seat. She arrived at the ticketing counter and they said her seat had been canceled and we would have to repurchase the same ticket I already paid for. So basically all the money I paid for the original ticket was wasted because they wanted more than twice as much for the exact same seat we already paid for. I never received any credit or refund. The ticketing agent on the phone was rude. I asked to speak with a supervisor and was told, supervisors do not speak with customers. They expected me to pay twice as much for the same seat I already paid for. I was beside myself. I found a better airline (wasn't hard, every airline is better). Won't be booking a flight on TAP Portugal ever again!

### "0 out of 10 for claims process"
I would like to start off this review by complementing TAP crew, new aircarft and in most cases food on long haul. Saying that as a word of warning though if you need to connect through Lisbon quickly (so less than an hour) be warned, it does not always end well. With aircraft parked the "other" side of the airfield the transfer process can be slow and frustrating. Even worse is that your bags often don't make it on to your connecting flight, so I always now carry my first days requirements in my hand luggage. So you can compensate in one way or another. What I cannot yet resolve is how to claim for compensation when bags do not arrive. I now send one email per month and try and phone (often not answered though even after 10 mins average wait time). TAP have told me that each complaint is taking them on average 6 month to respond to (note respond to and not resolve).Easiest way to resolve this issue is not have to claim in first place, so either dont fly with TAP or try and reduce need to claim. 0 out of 10 for claims process.

### "flexible to accept my request"
Porto to Lisbon. I want to thank TAP for being flexible to accept my request to fly on an earlier flight. Great implemented concept of Air Bridge between the two biggest cities of Portugal: Lisbon and Porto. Very friendly and professional check-in employee at Porto. Thank you.

### "she simply said go try another airline"
Not Verified |  Newark to Rome via Lisbon. My wife and I were taking a flight from Newark and unfortunately we got stuck on a highway road closure due to an accident and got to the gate 10 minutes before our flight took off. I tried calling the airline (local & 800 numbers) as we were sitting in the shut down and could not get a hold of anyone. When we finally got to the gate the associate at the check in counter was no help in helping us rebook or get to our destination, she simply said go try another airline and left the desk. I will never ever fly this airline again.

### "All in all 3 star level"
Alicante to Amsterdam via Lisbon. Basic service on a difficult day. May 9 was another day with ATC strikes in Spain, therefore many flights were delayed that day. Also pretty bad weather in Lisbon was having serious impact on TAP operation. So both my flights where delayed resulting in being able to get the connecting flight to Amsterdam and arriving about 2h 15 late in Amsterdam, resulting in taxi costs train. On board service is ok, a little snack and choice of drink on ALC-LIS 2h 10 and a little snack box and 1 drink round on LIS -AMS. Onboard crew are fine, not too friendly but acceptable. LIS-AMS was operated with new designed A320 and received at gate a free upgrade to a emergency row exit. I noticed that cockpit gives no or minimal information, so does the cabin crew. 2 hrs late would justify a bit more of apology. Airport transfer is substandard, food outlets are reasonably priced though. All in all 3 star level.

### "Baggage was damaged enroute"
Casablanca to Lisbon. Baggage was damaged enroute. All documentation submitted on the 25th April. Waited until the 6th June and contacted them again. Response was that it was taking a long time to deal with requests and they had no idea when the case would be considered.

### "pay extra and go non stop"
Not Verified |  Miami to Manchester via Lisbon. We arrived in Miami to find out we had to pay over 120 dollars each to check in one piece of luggage. Maybe this was my fault because when I was on the website it showed one free and I assumed this was the check in piece. I may have misunderstood but it surely wasn't clear. To have to pay that much for one piece of luggage is outrageous. I was then told it was because of the ticket I booked. I asked him how I would know next time and he said some of the 3rd party sites don't disclose this. Ok great start. So then the flight in Miami was delayed because of weather. When we got to Lisbon we missed our connection flight to Manchester. I get it things happen but this was the second negative. My husband was going to see his mother in the UK that he hadn't seen in 6 years and we were supposed to arrive in Manchester at 10am and ended up arriving after 5pm and still had a 2.5 hour drive. Long story short we ended up having to spend the entire day at the Lisbon airport. The connection flight was supposed to leave at 6.30 am or so and ended up leaving after 3pm. We were given lunch vouchers for 8 or so Euros. We were exhausted and had to sit in the waiting area the entire day. The flight from Miami to Lisbon was tight. We are both tall so had our knees smashed into the back seat. The way back was a much better plane with more leg room and no delays, but the way over taught me to just pay extra and go non stop rather then try and save money we ended up paying for with luggage both ways and precious time. So no won't do that again. Also when I got home and saw an email from them to take a survey, I clicked on it only to show it expired. That is why I found another way to voice this. I would have gone thru them if they gave you more then a few days to do the survey.

### "Absolutely dreadful experience"
Not Verified |  Absolutely dreadful experience to which I will not use them again. Left London on the 1/6/19 to Lisbon, waited in departures only to find that the flight was delayed for an hour. This gave no time at all to make our connecting flight in Lisbon to Funchal. When I spoke to the ticket agent at the terminal they said it might be a possibility that you won't connect in Lisbon, but have to take it up with them when you arrive. Arrived in Lisbon missed the flight, went to transfer desk no help what so ever rude not pleasant at all. Asked if they will accommodate us in a hotel until the morning, they stated it won't be possible as we don't have hotel accommodation available. Only snack voucher and new boarding card provided. Staff were not helpful but very quick to deviate off the subject and say we are closing speak to the staff in the morning. I used to fly TAP all the time and they were good then. Now well forget it, it's not worth the stars they been given at all. Also another good old trick TAP uses they always blame the weather when we know that the weather has nothing to do with there bad service. Courtesy goes along away to value a customer clearly non was shown that day. Lastly I flown a lot with other European airlines for less hours and the inflight food given was far superior then TAP, airlines like Swiss and Lufthansa are the best in my eyes.

### "Truly a nightmare"
Marrakech to Hamburg via Lisbon. Worst service ever! After boarding on time for flight 1453 to Lisbon, we were sitting in the plane for one hour. After some time I was wondering why we are still not flying... then the plane pulled out towards the runway but we had to stop again and then we had to get off the plane due to technical problems. back at the Terminal no one told us where to go nor what is going to happen. Finally we found out that the flight is suppose to leave from another gate so we went there but still no one gave us any Information.. so around 150 people randomly went to the personal sitting at the gate asking for a status and connection...which was a mess as they got stressed and all the passengers were stressed and annoyed and it was really hot after 5 Hours and a few lies from the Personal about no other flights or seats being available and not being provided with food or drinks, we were transferred to the next and last flight to Lisbon with a few other pax. The plane had at least 10 empty seats. Of course we missed the connecting flight to Hamburg. in Lisbon we were told that they didn’t have a room from their contingent of hotels but I said that I am not leaving without a hotel as everything was totally booked out or expensive. So they ended up finding a room for us, they also told us we would get on a flight at 12.10 the next day to HAM via FRA. Another couple who also had to go to ham was miraculously able to get transferred to the flight at 8am on Sunday. So we tried to check in on Sunday and again we had problems. Our reservation was cancelled so they put us on a flight at 6pm to HAM. This made us travelling for more 30 hours and a delay of 24hours at our final destination. We have experienced cancellation and delays in the past but never was I treated so badly. In Hamburg we then found out that our luggage got lost, even though we always received confirmation that the luggage was put on the flight they booked for us. Truly a nightmare

### "The flight was on time"
Barcelona to Porto. Great flight with TAP Portugal from Barcelona to Porto. The flight was on time with early arrival. Being the last flight of the day (11pm) and a Tuesday the plane wasn't full.

### "light snack was provided"
Excellent flight with on-time departure and arrival, and the captain spoke to passengers during the middle of the flight. Only a light snack was provided (and no drinks) but it seems reasonable given short duration of the flight (1 hour) . I received a text message the day before the flight saying I could check in my hand luggage for free, and decided to do so. There should be USB ports in every seat and not just for the higher economy fares.

### "rude and disrespectful"
My sister and I booked our tickets from JFK to Athens via Lisbon back in December of 2018. After our first couple of attempts to complete the purchase with TAP Air, we were denied the flight, as our card did not go through. Moments later, we received a call from TAP Air asking if they could help us finish our booking, and so we did, and I regret it now. Our flight ended up being a connecting flight with a 14 hour layover in Lisbon between our flights from JFK and ATH. Trying to get on our second connecting flight from Lisbon to ATH was a disaster. Our flights were canceled two hours before we flew out and neither airline would help fix it but rather they kept sending us back and forth between airlines, as they continually blamed it on each other, before TAP finally gave us a new flight, only for an entire day later. We said no, as we had other flights we had to catch the next day, and had to put up a stink before they finally rebooked us for our original flight. They were extremely rude and disrespectful during the entire process, creating a very unprofessional reputation. I will never book through either airline again.

### "swapped to older business class"
Toronto to Lisbon. Our aircraft on 13th May was swapped to one with their older business class. As a result my wife's and mine seats got separated. Ground crew was able to shift seats around so that at the end we were seated together. Boarding civilized, flight left and arrived on time. Even old business class angled lie flat seats allowed for good night sleep. Service on the ground and in the air was absolutely flawless. What distinguished this flight was its superb crew.

### "clear immigration and board on time"
Berlin to Toronto via Lisbon. Due to late incoming flight our plane left Berlin late allowing only for a 30 minute transfer time in Lisbon. Ground crew in Lisbon waited for us with instructions as to how reach plane in Lisbon on time, crew on Berlin flight gave us valuable connecting information. As we had experienced on our incoming flight - ground crew and in flight crew of TAP great. Attentive without being overburdening, helpful, friendly. What amazed us most was the fact that within the short 30 minute transfer time - even though the flight from Lisbon to Toronto left on time - we not only managed to clear immigration and board on time, even our checked bags made it onto the flight.

### "Not happy with TAP"
Not Verified |  Paris to San Francisco via Lisbon. Very high baggage fees and No hotel voucher for an all night 12 hour layover! Not happy with TAP. The bag fee for 1 checked 20 kg.bag was 80 USDon an International flight. I have never paid such a huge bag fee for same this bag on any International or Domestic flight. Also,most airlines provide a hotel room and meal voucher if the airline has more than an 8 hour layover (it was a 12 hour,all night layover in Lisbon). TAP does not provide either

### "recommend the new business class"
I can recommend the new business class in the new A330NEO. Staff seemed to be motivated. The catering out of Lisbon was fantastic (Welcome drink with nuts, Appetizer, Salat/Soup, Main meal, Dessert, Chocolat, quick snack prior to land). I cannot understand other customer's complaints about TAP staff. I found most of the flight attendants (senior on longhaul) are efficient. Great value for money due to relative low prices they ask for business class.

### "attendants chatting loudly"
Funchal to Lisbon. Flight operated by an Aigle Azur aircraft since TAP schedules more flights than they can operate with their current fleet. Flight attendants chatting loudly in the galley while passengers were trying to sleep.

### "hopeless and incompetent airline"
Lisbon to Funchal. This is a domestic flight of 80 minutes but they still managed to delayed it for more than two hours almost tripling the time that the travel would take. Totally hopeless and incompetent airline, informing passengers by messages that the flight was delayed - they sent me three, as the flight got more and more delayed. Pilot blamed it on a French Air Controllers strike - which is curious since the aircraft had been previously to Germany and Barcelona not France - and the cleaning staff. Avoid it as the plague. A young male flight attendant was rather rude in his attitude and showed obvious signs of job burnout.

### "not choose this airline again"
Not Verified |  The seats were super comfortable, and entertainment was great with a lot of new movies. But the food options were just bad. I at least got to pick between two out of four options, but my boyfriend could only choose the fish (which was disgusting). There weren’t really any snack options between the meals, which were served about 6 hours apart. To be fair, part of the staff was nice, but most were rude and unwelcoming. We flew with our 1-year old daughter, who was happy and quiet for almost the entire flight, but there was zero understanding from the staff when we walked around with her (the other passengers found her adorable and smiled and talked to her, which we really appreciated). You would think it would be in everybody’s interest that the parents keep their kid happy, but they just seemed pissed that we had the nerve to fly with a child at all. All in all: terrible food and service. We will not choose this airline again.

### "keep on sending constant e-mails"
Lisbon to Funchal with TAP Air Portugal. They keep on sending constant e-mails informing that my current flight itinerary is eligible for an upgrade to executive class and thus I can make an offer which stars at 115 eur per flight. It is a nuissance and with the current amount of e-mails their insistance is close to harassment.

### "Poor business lounge"
Lisbon to Barcelona. Flight delayed. Other than an obscure message (which I hope is untrue) claiming boarding closes 40 minutes before departure no message about delay sent. No boarding at gate and when the bus arrived the plane was not ready. 20 minutes wait inside the bus. The seats were good. No options on snacks. Poor business lounge offering.

### "we haven't seen a penny yet"
Very bad experience on my first time flying with TAP! My husband and I were returning from Salvador (Brazil) on the 4th October 2018. We arrived at the airport 4 hrs before our flight only to find out it had been cancelled (no email or message had been sent to us to inform this). We were one of the first to arrive in the airport, and joined what it seemed to be a small queue (which became huge after half an hour) as there was only 2 TAP attendants to reschedule everyone's flights. As you can imagine the queue was moving extremely slowly and we realised it would take ages for us to speak to someone. We called customer services in the UK and they offered us a route back to London with 3 connection flights, including a sleep over and 6+ hours of delay on our arrival, which was not an option for us. Seeking for an alternative, my husband approached Air Europa on a booth just next to TAP and they said they still had a considerable amount of seats available on their next flight to London, which was due to leave Salvador within the next 60'. They mentioned TAP could relocate us, and other passengers to this flight, but unfortunately, with only 2 staff available, TAP wasn't being able to actually process the relocations. Air Europa checkin would close within the next 20' and so we had to make a decision fast. We waited for another 10 minute, there was still 5 people in front of us at the queue and so we decided to purchase two seats with Air Europa, paying from our pocket. The family that was just in front of us on the queue said they could not afford so buy tickets for the whole family and so they waited in the queue. They told us later that when their turn finally arrived, they mentioned the Air Europa flight and were issued the tickets but, unfortunately not quick enough as as soon as they got their tickets in hands the checkin had already been closed. Air Europa flight was fairly empty and I wonder how many people TAP could have put in that flight if they had been more efficient. Arriving in London we made a claim through TAP's website for compensation (€600). After a few weeks we heard back from TAP asking for us to provide our personal and bank documents so they could process the payment, which we did straight away. On November 15 we received an email confirming they would proceed with payment, according to the Regulation (EC) No 261/2004, but since then we haven't heard back from them (nor have received any compensation). Since then I have spoken to various TAP customer service attendants on the phone, and all of them say they cannot provide any information about the payment, only that it has been approved and that will be processed at some point. I also sent several emails, with no response. It's been 7 months now since our flight was cancelled, and 6 months since we received a confirmation that payment had been approved, but we haven't seen a penny yet. Speaking to customer service is useless as all they repeat is that they do not have this piece of information, and are vague on all of their answers. I would definitely not fly with them again!

### "truly surprised with the efficiency"
I used TAP Portugal from Manchester to Porto with a stop in Lisbon. The flight from Manchester to Lisbon was late due to bad weather and for that reason I lost my connection. To my surprise on arrival to Lisbon there were TAP staff calling us to provide us with a boarding card for the next flight and take us to the gate. Also despite the short connection my hold bag made it to the final destination. Was truly surprised with the efficiency of the ground staff. On board, we had a brand new A320 NEO, very smooth and silent flight. The crew were very friendly and helpful considering my initial stress about my onward connection. Thank you for the great service.

### "my last trip with them!"
Gatwick to Porto. I flew TAP again this week and I will flew back to the UK late this week. However this will be probably my last trip with them! Flight delayed about 45 minutes, children and family's not been boarded first, luggage from rows 4 and 7 were send to the row number 15, 16 and 17! Here's the logic: you pay for a front seat and then you have to wait till everyone (or almost) to get out so you can go get your luggage and get off the plane! I asked nicely to the crew if they found this right or normal and ten answer was: not our fault! I shouldn't buy a TAP flight in the first place. Think twice before you fly with tem.

### "repetitive and boring catering"
Due to TAP's inability to cope with a fuel shortage in Portugal, my flight was delayed for an hour. I left the boarding area because they initiated the boarding procedures and then inadvertently stopped it leaving passengers looking at the ceiling and only informed by an almost codified internal sms announcing the delay. Almost didn't make it to the gate again as they suddenly re-opened the boarding process. Had to run through the crowded corridors to get there still on time to board. Needless confusion of an airline that still has much to learn. The problem is until they are funded by the Portuguese Republic and the EU, being one of the last still semi-public airline corporations in the world, they'll do whatever they like, the consequences being the paid taxes by Portugal citizens, unfairly making up for their annual losses. Lisbon airport getting older by the day and needing a revamp and expansion urgently. Improved cleaning wouldn't hurt either and it applies to TAP planes too. For the rest, nice and attentive cabin crew but repetitive and boring catering.

### "staff was not helpful at all"
Lisbon to Copenhagen. The staff was not helpful at all. Our flight was late for 1 hour due to heavy traffic, thus we were late for our next flight (we had connecting flights). We (there were 6 of us going to that next flight) asked the staff for help to let us leave the plane first or at least let us know which gate should we run to, however, the staff refused to help.

### "on a very old A340-300"
Rio de Janeiro to Marseille via Lisbon. GIG-LIS Business Class on a very old A340-300, old lie-flat seats - despite the constant TAP advertisement about A330NEO aircraft on Brazilian routes. Still pure marketing as after a couple of months these brand new aircraft are now mostly directed to USA route! Non-event flight anyway, with improvement in punctuality, service, food and entertainment. A340 are silent aircraft and difference is clear when compared to A330/B777. Friendly and not packed lounge in LIS. Economy class from LIS to MRS. Also non-event flight. Note that for TAP, in this case (Business+Economy) the lowest baggage allowance applies for both segments. I.e. 23kg/PC and not 32/PC fro GIG to MRS. Even being a Star Alliance Gold pax. Weird.

### "vouchers were no longer valid"
Not Verified |  In April 2018 we were supposed to go as a family of 5 to Lisbon. They said that my wife was too pregnant to fly and that we had to rebook within one year of the date of travel. I called back 2 days before the one year mark and they told me my vouchers were no longer valid - we were late by 3 days from the one year mark of cancellation. They gave us bad info on the front end and then took $3000 from me and would not let me speak to anyone beyond their first line of customer service. The customer service kept consulting with a Manager, but I could not speak to them. I was warned by friends and neighbors not to deal with this airline and now I wish I hadn't.

### "disrespectful and embarrassing"
Not Verified |  Miami to Barcelona via Lisbon. The worst airline I have ever been in and the worst assistance to people. Our plane from Miami was delayed so we got here late and when we were trying to get in to the plane they told us we couldn't because the plane had left. We had to wait over 12 hours in an airport the whole day. I was with my 4 kids for over 18 hours at the airport and they messaged me saying the flight was even more delayed. This is beyond disrespectful and embarrassing.

### "Excellent value"
London to Gran Canaria via Lisbon. Excellent value and service on all flights. All on time, despite some confusion at Lisbon airport re boarding gate. Clean aeroplanes. Boarding straightforward. Pleasant and efficient cabin crew who served a small snack and hot drink. The seats are not the most comfortable but 2/3 hours perfectly manageable. Nothing to complain about re the journey. However their customer services dept is variable when you telephone (I needed to increase my luggage allowance which requires telephone contact for a multi booking). First person I spoke to poor communication and attitude, the second person total opposite, most helpful and dealt with the adjustment swiftly and effiently. Also some anomalies to iron out on their website but would definitely use them again.

### "Flight was ok, but cramped"
Dakar to London via Lisbon. Flight was ok, but cramped. Forgot my wallet in aircraft, but had no time to retrieve it due to short layover. I was told to stop at the London airport lost and found to initiate a report, but they could not help me. All further contacts with TAP Portugal or Lisbon airport were fruitless. They held my wallet hostage, basically telling me I had to pay 1400$ in order to fly back in the next 4 days or the wallet would be "destroyed", despite having all my mailing address available and more than enough money inside to cover the costs of shipping it home. Oh, and the lady beside me took 1/4 of my seat the whole flight.

### "Made me stay in Lisbon"
Not Verified |  Hamburg to Salvador via Lisbon. Horrible service. They overbooked my long haul flight. Made me stay in Lisbon. Complaint office with huge queue... no wonder they made a loss of 120 million EUR in 2018.

### "seat also comfortable"
Rio de Janeiro to Budapest via Lisbon. The servive at GIG Airport was quiet nice, the plane and seat also comfortable. Food served is okay, staff was old but they'reso helpful. The connecting flight to BUD was just "okay". Definitely good option

### "Very poor customer service"
Not Verified |  New York to Rome via Lisbon. Very poor customer service. Cancellation policy is a scam to take as much money from clients and in my case, amounted to more than the price of the tickets. I would not recommend this airline at all. Not even to my worse enemy.

### "plenty of leg room"
A great flight with TAP. LIS to JFK on a nice A330. Plane was sort of full but I was lucky to have two seats for myself. Economy service is excellent. I had plenty of leg room and entertainment. Crew friendly, pleasant and willing to have a convo with passengers. I request a special meal when I can and I did this time. Nice tasty food.

### "as Portuguese citizen I try to use them"
Gatwick to Lisbon. I haven't flown TAP in a while but as Portuguese citizen I try to use them. Great service overall. Plane clean, pilot very communicative with the passengers. Great service, on time flight and food!

### "poorest customer service"
London to Accra via Lisbon. I just experienced the most uncaring and poorest customer service my entire life. To start with their people at their check in kiosks and help desk, simply put everyone with a TAP Portugal badge at the airport is trained to be rude and treat people less. Another one of them on the phone told me they are not authorized to stay on the phone for long so I should go figure out stuffs on my own and call them back. Long story short I missed my flight after waiting in line for more than 45 minutes. There are only 2 people helping check in travelers, first they are so slow. Finally when it got to my turn to check in I was at the blink of time to miss my flight. They checked me in, got me a boarding pass and tagged one of my bags but asked me to remove any electronics from my second bag and when I was done removing this (in less than 1 minute) the lady told me the check in has just closed. After speaking to everyone with a tap Portugal badge all they were saying was I am considered a no show at that point so I should pay 573$ to get rebooked into another flight. Called their booking services and they were even the worst of them all, so rude. This people treat you like they offered you a free ticket and that you can’t say anything about it. They were all basically telling me to pay that 573$ or forfeit my ticket and go find another for myself. My only advice to anyone reading this is please save yourself the respect you deserve and don’t fly with this airline. I should have paid more attention to their bad review when I was buying from them.

### "Overall a great experience"
Lisbon to London. After the negative reviews I was not expecting much but this flight was  one of my best intra-European flights in a time when it’s all about reducing services to keep flights cheap and competitive. The crew was very friendly, the plane was clean and comfortable, and to my surprise a box with a chicken wrap, crackers, some chocolate was served as inflight meal on this 2:30 hrs flight incl cold and hot drinks. Overall a great experience, would definitely fly with them again.

### "they've been improving"
Funchal to Lisbon. It saddens me to read these negative reviews about TAP because as a frequent flyer I am a witness of how much they've been improving since last year to get better, from the young and friendly cabin crews to healthy and generous catering. Their punctuality are better too. They still have some work to do on how they process complaints, requests and some of their post-purchase staff and services.

### "will try to avoid TAP"
Not Verified |  New York to Casablanca via Lisbon. I booked a flight with TAP  through Orbitz. TAP then changed my flight so I wouldn’t make a connecting flight, and when Orbitz tried to contact them to make a simple change to my flight schedule, they couldn’t even respond (it’s been over three weeks), so they had to refund my flight and now I’m left with half my tickets for my trip, but no way to get to where I need to go. I love Orbitz, but will try to avoid TAP airline at any cost.

### "Worst airline ever"
Worst airline ever. I fly once or twice a week and this is the first time I have ever felt compelled to write a review. I was flying from Miami to Milan with a layover in Portugal. 1) I had a complaint with the online booking process so I emailed them 3 times and did not receive one reply. 2) I selected my seats online and when I got on the plane they were not the ones I selected, both flights. And to make it worse, I was stuck in the middle, both flights. 3) No where under baggage information did it say that I would have to pay $120 for my 1 check-in bag when I checked in. It was not over weight or oversized, it was just a rip off. 4) No Wi-Fi on either flight. 5) Seats don't recline on my second flight. 6) Food was terrible. 7) I was freezing the entire first 6 hour flight. 8) Plane was old and dirty. Never again TAP Portugal!

### "Horrible customer service"
Lisbon to Newark. Horrible customer service. Even when you pay for business class! Lost and then damaged bag in New York (EWR). Still waiting for a refund of $626 from September 2018! Avoid this airline.

### "tense and unpleasant atmosphere throughout"
I normally fly AF/KL/DL but TAP had a convenient schedule and on the MIA-LIS sector, I was able to join two colleagues who were booked on that sector. I booked a VGML and was told by the call centre that special meals could not be booked on intra-European flights, even in business class. TAP, to my knowledge, is the only European legacy carrier not to offer this basic service to its premium customers. Once onboard, the breakfast served were two slices of grey-ish meat and 2 slices of sweaty cheese which had obviously been left unrefrigerated overnight onboard (the Purser confirmed TAP only gets catered in LIS for this flight and that the catering arrives the previous day and remains onboard). A croissant was then given, and it was mouldy. I returned everything untouched. We arrived in Lisbon on a remote stand and there was no separate bus for Premium passengers. I made my way to the non-Schengen area where all TAP long-haul flights depart from, and walked around to try to locate the business class lounge. After 20 minutes of looking, a staff member told me that the lounge was in the Schengen area. Seeing how enormous the queues were to get back to the non-Schengen terminal earlier I decided to head to the gate directly as by now there were only 30 minutes left to board. I sat at the gate and observed how the boarding time came and went. The TAP app still said “on-time” even though the departure time had passed, and no word from the gate agents until H+10, when someone at the gate said that due to late crew, boarding was delayed indefinitely. We departed 2 hours late and the Captain apologised, saying that two crew members were late due to a traffic accident on the way to the airport and we had to wait for them. Are there no stand-by crew at TAP's main hub? The aircraft was a run-down A330-300 with a business class straight out of 1995. Slanted seats, yellowing walls, dirty toilets and unresponsive seat controls. The meal was slightly better than on the first sector, but outside of meal service, not a single crew member came out with a drinks tray. We arrived 2 hours late in Miami but at least my bags arrived promptly. I called TAP's US call centre about my poor experience and they assured me that my return flight from MIA to LIS would be vastly improved as it was to be operated by a A330-200 with the new business class. I logged on to my account and saw that indeed, the configuration was different and looked more spacious and I had been re-assigned to a single-throne seat. The day before the flight, I checked in online and to my horror, I saw that the plane had been reverted to the same substandard A330-300 I had on LIS-MIA. Needless to say I was unable to sleep on that night flight and my seat had been re-assigned several rows away from my colleagues. Several passengers complained to the crew and I must say they handled it the best they could, but it made for a particularly tense and unpleasant atmosphere throughout the flight. I visited the lounge in LIS prior to my flight to TXL and it was jam-packed. Only one coffee machine worked. The area to the right of the lounge, a semi-circular row of designer seats was filthy with each seat heavily stained. I could not believe this was a new lounge at TAP´s flagship airport. Boarding for the LIS-TXL was done the Ryanair way, cramming everybody in the airbridge for 20 minutes as the crew was not yet ready. I complained to TAP, and still waiting for an acknowledgement 3 months later.

### "aircraft was clean"
Valencia to Warsaw via Lisbon. I booked the flight at the same day, I've got a very good price. As a customer of cheap airlines, I was shocked as I did not have any problems with my carry-on bags (they even came to help me with my 5 bags at the cabin), they served drinks and food, the departures and arrivals were on time, the aircraft was clean, pilots landed smoothly, the staff was super helpful. The only problem that I see: quite expensive check-in bag, but (if you are a saver like me) you can carry as much luggage as you want to the cabin.

### "do not recommend"
Frankfurt to Lisbon. Terrible and do not recommend. Was almost late for the flight because of the terrible customer service. The baggage drop off section was unattended  for 30 mins leading me to have to wait with the people doing check in. That took almost an hour, which insane and a huge oversight and inefficiency on TAP.

### "totally fly with them again"
Barcelona to Porto. Decided to book TAP Air Portugal to go to Porto for Christmas. Initially paid for a economy ticket. The airline has an upgrade online system that you can bid for, so I decided to treat myself with a Business ticket for Christmas. The upgrade was accepted and was a great idea. Barcelona airport in the morning had a busy security with massive lines, so I had a very smooth process since bag drop until board the plane. The lounge was comfortable too. The flight was really full, but on time and we arrived in Porto 5 min or so ahead of schedule. Is clear that the airline been improving their service in the last years, will totally fly with them again.

### "never fly this airline again"
Madrid to Miami via Lisbon. Terrible, no doubt not up to the level of Star Alliance. The ground staff in Lisbon were rude throughout the process, from check in to boarding. Arrogant, rude, and absolutely incompetent. Provided wrong information, made us waste money on something that was not necessary, and never apologised. Flight attendants 50 - 50. Some of them Ok, some others rude too. Asked for a glass of water and was ignored, as the attendant was "busy" reading the Portuguese newspaper. Hopefully will never fly this airline again.

### "served a comprehensive hot breakfast"
Copenhagen to Lisbon with TAP Portugal. Flight left on time, we were served a comprehensive hot breakfast (rare thing to see in European flights these days), the crew were friendly, the captain spoke twice to the passengers to update us on the progress of the flight, the seat had plug to charge devices and we arrived earlier. What else could we ask for? The only negative aspect had nothing to do with the airline but with the airport. The boarding in Copenhagen was confuse since there is no boarding by zones like in Lisbon.

### "meal was excellent"
Lisbon to New York JFK. I'm quite puzzled by some of the negative reviews on here. I thoroughly enjoyed my flight with TAP. The crew was delightful - smiling, friendly, and couldn't do enough for you. The meal was excellent, as was the inflight entertainment system. The choice was very wide, and I watched two films in the course of the flight, so films and eating didn't leave me that much time to sleep. I did get about four hours though, which is a lot for someone who can rarely sleep on planes; the bed was comfortable and TAP kept the temperature on board on the cool side, which is what I like. Last, but most definitely not least, other airlines whose ticket prices I checked were charging upwards of 5000 Swiss francs for a one-way flight for the date on which I needed to travel. My TAP ticket was CHF1300 - a huge difference in price with no difference in quality. I wouldn't hesitate to fly them again.

### "offers a solid product"
Toronto to Lisbon. TAP offers a solid product with good value for money. However, we got one of the oldest A330's in the fleet (CS-TOG) with an outdated entertainment system without "video on demand" capabilities (only half a dozen continuously running channels). Hopefully these will be phased out over the coming years as the airline replaces them with the brand new A330 neo. One thing that bothers me about TAP is that the captain often doesn't talk to the passengers, which was the case. There was no talk either prior to take-off or after take-off. The flight attendants were in general friendly and helpful. The meal was ok-ish, but still beats what is provided on the same route with Air Canada. The ground staff at the check-in at Pearson was not particularly helpful or friendly but at least they let families with small children board first (which was our case) and in the end the luggage arrived.

### "staff were extremely nice"
Lisbon to London Heathrow. A regular flight. The staff were extremely nice, the meal was satisfactory. As it often happens with TAP, the flight was slightly late. As there was an aircraft change, some people had their seats changed.

### "just trying to milk customers"
Abidjan to Lisbon. Flight was delayed by more than 3 hours, customer service was anything but kind and receptive to my complaint. Information about delay was given last minute. Personnel on board are alright but the organisation running TAP is clearly just trying to milk customers out of as much money as possible without providing the necessary ressources for a comfortable trip.

### "departing more on schedule"
Lisbon to Funchal. I feel they upgraded their service quite dramatically in recent months. Their catering and general attitude on board is much better than it used to be. Flights are now departing more on schedule too.

### "have really improved"
Lisbon to Marseille. Extremely quick and pleasant checkin and fast lane security check. Boarding, as usual with TAP was a total mess; They first called premium pax and them we were compelled to wait in an over-heated finger during more than 15 mn. Food and service on board have really improved. Staff make clear efforts. Departure on-time, and arrival 20 mn earlier.

### "stated I did not have a ticket"
Lisbon to Madrid. I flew business class to Lisbon and the problem occurred when I tried to board my connecting flight to Madrid - at the gate I produced my e ticket, the receipt for my ticket and my boarding pass issued in Toronto. The boarding agent stated I did not have a ticket! I missed my flight and had to go back to the TAP desk were the ticket agent said there was a computer glitch, that I did have a ticket and she would book me on a later flight, three hours later! There was no apology let alone any signs of contrition. In compensation I asked for access to the business class lounge since I had flown business class from Toronto - both the ticket agent and receptionist refused me access - they were both surly and one was down right rude. Attempts to complain to the airline have been fruitless - the response did not address the main point of my complaint i.e the ticket issue.

### "They were robotic, no smile"
Sao Paulo to Lisbon. Lucky we were to get a retrofitted A330, not the NEO, but retrofitted are OK. Star Alliance GRU lounge was well catered despite the past-midnight hours. Boarding was a long lasting mess as usual with TAP, with confusing announcements, multiple lines, and so on. Flight left as planned at 02:20 AM. They served a dinner at 03:30 and a breakfast at 1 PM. Something should be changed. Other airlines (NH, SQ TG, EK) in these cases offer to switch. TAP staff firmly refused. They were robotic, no smile, but extremely efficient. Luggage arrived very fast.

### "worst flight experiences"
Madrid to São Paulo via Lisbon. One of the worst flight experiences of my life. First the flight from Madrid to Lisbon got delayed by 1:30h due to a previous delay in the aircraft covering the route, once we boarded and the taxi started the aircraft stopped and we were waiting for another 45-50 minutes without any further explanation from the crew. Once in Lisbon the bus that took us to the terminal didn't move for another extra hour so what looked like a big layover between for my flight to sao paulo ended up being in almost missing the flight. In the flight to Sao Paulo I was told by the crew that the seat I've paid for was broken (65€ for an emergency exit) and they offered to relocate me in a front row seat with "the same legroom". After the flight I checked the legrooms of both seats and of course it wasn't even similar. As a side effect, the passenger that was seating in my new seat got relocated as well to a normal seat despite she claimed that she had paid for the seat 50€ the cabin crew obviously lied to her and told that the plane changed and the seat she paid for was not available.

### "missed our connecting flight"
Faro to Lisbon. STD 11.15/ATD 14.13 from Faro with STA 12.00/ATA 14.54 at Lisbon. This meant we (along with many others) missed our connecting flight to Dubai. TAP ground staff were absolutely with Transfer staff saying "not our problem" and even refusing our request for complimentary lounge access. It was only due to the persistence of our 'MyWay' helper that we managed to get seats on the 20.35 Emirates flight. The Emirates flight manager in contrast could not have been more helpful, commenting that this was a regular occurrence, and giving 3 seats for the 2 of us to make us more comfortable. The return flight TP1901 was also 45 minutes late! Considering almost 100% of passengers on the Faro - Lisbon route are connecting with other flights one would think it should be given priority in time keeping whereas in fact it seems to be treated as an unnecessary nuisance. Additionally the seat pitch makes EasyJet comfortable and Ryanair luxurious

### "A very good flight"
I arrived at the business class check-in at Lisbon airport for my lunchtime flight. A pleasant lady checked me in and secured my luggage. I made my way to the TAP Lounge which was spacious but busy. I had some food and a nice Gin & Tonic. Boarding for the flight was fine. Same layout as my previous flight. Quite a small seat 1A, middle seat unused. The service was excellent. I had a nice fish lunch with some nice port. And the hostess kept refilling my champagne. A very good flight. I arrived into Bologna early waiting for my cousin to pick me up and off to a nice dinner in Emilia Romagna.

### "Overall a good flight"
London to Lisbon. This was an early morning flight from Heathrow to Lisbon. Check-in was quick, I made my way to the Lounge, I ended up in the United Lounge as every other lounge was closed. A good breakfast and went straight to the gate. Boarding was a little chaotic advising business class passengers to board and then not letting them board. I sat down and waited until they boarded economy. The seat is very tight, economy seat with the middle seat unused. The staff were very good and I had a cold breakfast to Lisbon. Nice bloody Mary. Overall a good flight arrived on time and nice crew.

### "seat pitch is very tight"
Madrid to Helsinki via Lisbon. For me these were the most uncomfortable and painful flights ever. Flying 50+ flights a year this was my 1st and last booking with TAP Portugal. Boarding procedure was complicated and not very effective from passenger's view. On the 2nd flight passengers were rushed to the air bridge to wait for the plane to get ready. After about 15 minutes of waiting people started slowly move into the cabin. Onboard the plane the main issue for a tall passenger like me (I am 1.92m / 6' 3") was the complete lack of legroom on TAP Portugal's A320 fleet. The seat pitch is very tight on these planes. Airline also forces all the passengers to keep their hand bags under the seat in front of them which adds up to the lack of space (they were very strict about the policy). Sitting in an extremely tight space with absolutely no possibility to move my feet for nearly 5 hours was pure torture for me. On the other hand people with large hand luggage were allowed to use the overhead compartments leaving more legroom for their feet. This means traveling light is not advised on this airline. No IFE of any kind available. Both flights were on time and the food served on the second leg (the first leg was short so no food service really needed) was ok. However my experience was just horrible and painful. I will never ever fly TAP again and I'll encourage all my friends to avoid TAP as well.

### "how much they improved"
Vienna to Lisbon. I had nightmare experiences with them in the past, but I'm positively surprised on how much they improved. First of all, both flights left on time and arrived on time. This is granted for most airline companies, but with TAP it was always a gamble. Crew was very pleasant, the cabin is the standard in European flights, including a power and USB outlet. There's also a tablet holder in the front seats. However, what impressed me the most was the meal was really tasty, wasn't expecting such a good meal.

### "They lost our luggage"
Nice to Faro via Lisbon in August 2018. They lost our luggage and we received no help finding it, no communication from them to us. Our holiday was ruined. We had to contact them for information but they constantly told us they knew nothing about the luggage. We found our luggage by ourselves (it had never even left the original airport!) We put in a claim for toiletries and clothes we had to buy without our luggage. They now four months later are still trying to avoid paying the refund. They are saying they never received a tracked and signed for letter with original receipts. They are the worst airline I have ever had the misfortune to fly with, the worst customer service I have ever had. Avoid a lot of stress and do not fly with them.

### "don't respect their passengers"
Not Verified |  Rome to Lisbon via Faro. I have had to fly TAP often because my family and I visit my parents in Albufeira, and from Rome they practically have a monopoly (along with Alitalia) on flights to Faro. In all the years that we have flown, we have always had problems (delays, confusion, rude staff, etc.). Yet, never as bad as this time. The flight from Rome to Lisbon arrived late, and because of this we (family of four – two minors) miss our connecting flight (always TAP) to Faro. After a chaotic experience in Lisbon airport we were told by TAP personnel that notwithstanding the late hour, TAP is unable to help us find somewhere to stay that night, and that the next TAP flight available is going to make us arrive in Faro some 15 hours after we were meant to! But the TAP personnel did say that we would be reimbursed for our overnight expenses to the tune of about 90 EURO each. To do this we must follow a procedure which they described. Though with difficulty we managed to find somewhere to stay, and followed their procedures exactly as told. Our delay of course created a number of personal problems, but that is to be expected with a 15 hour delay to a 45 minutes flight which leaves numerous times every day - such a long delay is completely unexpected. Anyway, four months after the fact I received an email stating that they won't reimburse us because "we don't qualify" for compensation. So, my conclusion is: I will never fly TAP again as they clearly don't respect their passengers, and I strongly recommend others to look for alternatives.

### "less canceled flights"
Lisbon to Funchal. Their recent modifications to catering and cabin crew now friendly disposition made me decide to review them with a good catering. Food on board is of very good quality and healthy with flight attendants particularly pleasant. Less delays and less canceled flights are something to note too. The recent administration should maintain this course. It is however very unfortunate the excessive prices for some domestic flights of less than an hour and a half where there is a near commercial monopoly of TAP, particular to and from Madeira.

### "using very old A330-200"
Lisbon to Rio de Janeiro. At the time when TAP is advertising its new A330-200 NEO, they are still using very old A330-200. I was unlucky to fly on one of these. 4 movie channels in loop on an invisible microscopic screen. Lie-flat dirty bed with a very strong bad smell. Food was nice (fish) that I could previously order on their website (new ). However some FA were rude, and refused to serve cheese AND fruit, because they had full house. Suddenly I felt bad. Note they did not respect basic rules and served wine during 10 hours to 2 gentlemen already drunk entering the plane who laughed and shouted all the time. It should be forbidden to airlines to advertise a brand new plane (A330 NEO) when they only have 1 unit,. Nearly deserving an action.

### "a clear improvement"
Marseille to Lisbon. I have been flying this route regularly. There is a clear improvement in check-in attitudes, punctuality, food and beverages, and even in FA attitude. Prices have slightly been increased too, despite Ryanair competition between both cities. But I strongly believe that same competition has compelled TAP to offer a better product, where she had a true monopoly.

### "very poor customer service"
New York to Dakar via Lisbon. Terrible service! They charge excessive prices for luggage. I was charged $120 for 1 luggage (not additional luggage). This info was not on my confirmation ticket, or any of the 100 emails they sent me prior to the flight,so i found out about the $120 fee when i arrived for my flight! They said I was charged because I bought a discounted ticket. So they charged me $120 on my only luggage for trying to save $30 on my plane ticket? Also very poor customer service. I would not recommend this company to anyone!

### "a great experience"
Barcelona to Lisbon. Booking was very simple and I got a great deal for this trip, paying about 8€ more than the cheapest low cost airline would had costed me. Online check in was fairly simple. Ground crew was very nice, a shame they didn't spoke any Portuguese but that is ok, and they gave me priority because I had no cabin bags, which was nice. Boarding was very simple and fast. The crew met us with a smile and the airplane was clean. Nice seats with enough shoulder room, typical of an Airbus and very good pitch for a economy class flight. We departed on time. Very nice flight, no turbulence at all. The crew was helpful and nice and speedily served a nice meal. Nothing fancy but it was made with nice tasting and fresh ingredients. A nice wine, a very nice piece of Portuguese chocolate salame, a simple but fresh sandwich with rye bread and a coffee. You couldn't ask for much more. We arrived ahead of time and unboarding was super fast. I think there was no wifi and no onboard entertainment but enough e-books and e-papers were provided at check in. All in all, a great experience, an enjoyable flight and an amazing price!

### "Worst service ever!"
Miami to Stuttgart via Lisbon. Worst service ever! I will never fly again with TAP AIR. In January 2018 I booked a flight with TAP AIR from Miami via Lisbon to Stuttgart. When I was about to check-in in the airport of Miami, I was told that my booking is not in their system. After what felt like a few hours of investigation, the staff told me that this happened due to a system error from TAP. The money for the flight was nevertheless deducted from my bank account, after I made the booking. I was not offered a new flight, thus I had to stay another day in Maimi and book a new flight the next day which was twice as expensive. I immediately issued a complaint at their complaint management. However, ever since (it’s been over 7 months now) each time I reached out to them in order to check the status they just kept telling me to wait because my complaint was not processed yet. Today, I wanted to check once again the status and my complaint was deleted from their system. I really have no words for this disrespectful service.

### "really good service"
Barcelona to Oporto with TAP. The flight wasn’t full and it was an amazing flight to Oporto. The seats were very comfortable and the flight arrived early into Oporto. Excellent cabin crew and really good service.

### "Our luggage did not arrive"
Madrid to Praia via Lisbon. We travelled to Praia for a friend's wedding. Our luggage did not arrive and we did all declarations at the airport as more than 10 other clients! It was complicated to contact the team airport (in fact impossible!) and as well the hotline (with a very important extra cost from Cap Verde to Portugal). The hotline informed us any necessity goods will be refunded as we did not received our luggage and we should wait 21 days to make sure the luggage was definitely lost. When we contact them after 21 days, TAP informed us that we will not be refunded for our expenses, our lost luggage or compensated because we did not send a list of items, knowing we fulfilled it at the airport. Now, all the time we called the hotline they informed us they cannot help us and the dedicated service does not answer the emails. We learnt later that almost 25% of the wedding invitees who travelled with TAP did not receive their luggage. Then, it seems our case was not unique.

### "miserable, lazy and unfriendly"
Sao Tome to Lisbon. The most miserable, lazy and unfriendly cabin crews that I have experienced for a long time. They seem to have no interest in their job or the passengers. Tried calling using the attendant call-button 4 times to get a cup of coffee, all ignored. No refills of drinks offered during or after the meal, and once the meal was over then passengers in economy class were ignored. Similar story on the return flight, with the staff preferring to sit and rest rather than do the job that they are actually paid to do. Very poor 'meal' for such a long flight....jelly is for children's parties not for adult meals. And the 'muffin' was a child sized portion also. The aircraft (A320) was also not comfortable for an 8 hour journey and also had NO inflight entertainment. Have taken 3 flights with TAP recently (we all make mistakes) and the boarding process on each of them has been a mess. The whole airline seems to be worse than a budget airline, and I will certainly avoid them in future.

### TAP Portugal customer review
Marrakech to New York via Lisbon. Horrible customer service, terrible technology, and just utter incompetence. I have never witnessed such a poorly operated airline before with lazy employees.

### "very nice staff"
Lisbon to Frankfurt. A regular flight, with very nice staff. The aircraft was new and even Economy had charging sockets. Food could be better, but it was acceptable for a mid-morning snack. The flight was a bit late leaving Lisbon, but arrived on time.

### "disappointing experience"
Faro to Oslo via Lisbon. Our disappointing experience with TAP began when we couldn't book our flights on their website over several days. So we had to book them on the phone, where the agent also had trouble and took 40 minutes to book, and we had to pay 32 euros more than the web price. We asked for a partial refund (to apply toward the extra cost of reserving seats) and after 8 months and several follow-up calls, they refused to refund the difference. On both flights to and from Faro everyone with regular carry-on luggage was forced to stow their bags in the hold while people with backpacks (including huge full-size ones) got to use the overhead bins. No wonder this airline has a 5/10 rating!

### "aircraft cleaned before boarding"
Funchal to Lisbon. Most recent catering menu renovations was a real upgrade from the previous food served on board. Very healthy and tasty accompanied with Portuguese wines, cheese and a small chocolate. Also young, smiley and attentive cabin crew. Flight on time and aircraft cleaned before boarding.

### "attentive cabin crew"
Lisbon to Luxembourg. The departure of this flight was somewhat bumpy (initial flight cancelled following a wildcat strike by the baggage handler at the arrival airport) but the airline did well afterwards. We were rerouted to the closest airport and a very comfortable shuttle was organised to the final destination. Regarding the flight, it was my first experience with this airline and it was excellent. Charming, attentive cabin crew. A snack meal was served, certainly light (half a wrap, juice and biscuit) but very good and free.

### "lethargic and unresponsive"
Funchal to Lisbon. I was abruptly told by a female member of boarding staff at Funchal airport to wait separately from the line as I had hand luggage. However most people had trolleys and were being processed normally. On board pilot announced that we would be waiting up to two hours inside the plane until they got ATC authorization to head to Lisbon. Keeping in mind this is a one hour and a half flight it is quite outrageous. Catering on board continues to be good though. TAP continues being the lethargic and unresponsive company it has always been when contacted by their customers for any purpose.

### "Old aircraft and old seats"
New York to Dusseldorf via Lisbon. Kind stewardesses, punctual flight, seats had headrest wings, good to sleep. No meat free option on the plane. On the flight NYC-Portugal the first meal was served after 1,5 hours flying, disrupting the sleep and increasing jet-lag possibility. The breakfast was served about 1,5 hours before landing, disrupting sleep again. The lights were kept on during the greatest part of the flight. Old aircraft and old seats.

### "put me on a later flight"
I flew from London to Lisbon and to Porto via Lisbon. The flight from London was delayed so they assumed  I would not make it on time for the flight to Porto and just put me on a later flight, which meant I could not pick up the car I had rented in Porto - I landed in Porto at nearly 1 in the morning because of that. Lost the money from the car rental and had to disturb friends to pick me up at Porto airport. Wrote them to complain - didn't even bother replying. The person at the desk in Lisbon boarding passengers to Porto pretended he could not understand me when I asked why my ticket was not valid for the flight I had booked - and Portuguese is my mother tongue. Had =a problem years ago when they went on strike on my mom's birthday and although I used to fly regularly with them, I only do now if I have no option

### "The flight was pleasant"
Rome to London via Lisbon. The flight was pleasant. The fare was very convenient and booking options very flexible . My seat was comfortable and clean. Healthy and tasty food and drink options on board. The staff at check on was efficient. Operations and workflow well managed, cabin staff service very kind and helpful.

### "We were pleasantly surprised"
We were pleasantly surprised and we flew Economy from Lisbon to Toronto. By the reviews were were not expecting much, but the flights were awesome. The people were friendly. The food was good as far as airline food goes. The seats were as comfortable as can be after 7-9 hours. The TV entertainment from Toronto to Lisbon was lacking, only 2 choices in English. Coming home, plenty of choices to make the flight go faster. The stewards were polite, smiling. The wine was amazing! Would definitely fly with TAP again, and will recommend to anyone looking to fly to Portugal.

### "We are super disappointed"
Copenhagen to Faro via Lisbon. We are super disappointed with lack of responsiveness from TAP.Basically the impression we are left behind with are that TAP is ignoring both their customer and the EU legislation!!! Maybe you should all consider if you want to fly with such a company? The story: Our daughter at age 17 was flying from Copenhagen (CPH) to Faro (FAO) via Lisbon August 1st and experienced a delay of 7 hours (and quite bad support along all the delays). According to the EU regulations EC 261/2004 we believe this entitles us to compensation. We filed all needed documentation in the TAP system August 5th - received e-mail confirmation of complaint 276955, but after that no reaction! We then filed a follow-up to the complaint Oct 3rd to inform TAP that we considered filing a complaint with the Danish authorities if we did not hear from TAP in 2 weeks - e-mail confirmation again, but after that still no reaction! I just checked the status today Nov 6th - more than 3 months later! Just information about that the complaint is received.

### "TAP will not pay for anything"
Amsterdam to Porto. My TAP flight in March 2018 was canceled as soon as I step foot after the airport security. TAP helpdesk computer system at the airport was down and no help provided. Everybody was advised to get another flight by ourself if we had the chance. I did it and it costed me 200€. I asked TAP to refund the costs involved and I've been calling since then and every time the answer is the same: I understand and I'm gonna flag your case to the right department straight away. You will receive a written answer. This happened in March 15th. Today is the November 5th. I called again and in 2 minutes the person on the phone had a answer. TAP will not pay for anything because their plane has been hit by a lightning. Be prepared to get no refund from TAP.

### "by far the worst experience"
Porto to London via Lisbon. I have been flying internationally since 1968, and my experience with TAP has to be by far the worst experience. First we had to make changes to our itinerary at exorbitant cost, and at the airport my wife and I were charge additionally for our luggage - small carry on suit case - 83 Euros. The staff appeared not to have happy lives and were officious at best as they implemented TAP's usury charges. The flight out of Lisbon to London was delayed 2 hours because of heavy rains, and. when we collected our two bag in London we found that they and the clothes inside were soaking wet -- the luggage had obvious been left in the rain during the transfer in Lisbon. When we went to the agency handing damaged baggage in the Heathrow Airport customs baggage retrieval area, we were informed that they didn't handle that kind of damage. When we asked to speak to a manager, we were informed rudely that they were in the ticketing desk outside of customs. No one bothered to check the luggage. Once outside, we found the ticketing desk agent who informed us that the people inside the customs area handle such issues. After a bit of arguing the ticketing agent directed us to the person handling boarding operations. Finally someone not associated with TAP directed us a telephone that we could uses to contact the folks in the customs area. A nice young man finally arrived who made a cursory examination of the wet clothes and luggage and took me back through security to where a supervisor recorded my complaint and gave me instructions as to how to file my complaint with TAP. I pointed out the TAP representative who ignored my presence. It took more than 2 hours to get this done -- a task that should have taken 15 minutes. Base on my experience, I don't have high expectations for compensation for damages (clothes and luggage). After reading some of the other reviews, I can only ask -- Why would anyone fly TAP?

### "a very nice flight"
I flew from Munich to Lisbon. It has been a very nice flight. The staff was very nice as well, the food correct for an economy flight (ham and cheese sandwich and small sweet for dessert). Comfortable seat. The drop-off, the ground service and the announcements were operated by the Lufthansa. The Lufthansa staff was not very nice. The TAP staff was nice.

### "Had to pay for a new flight"
Booked a flight, had to change my dates, was told by customer service to cancel my departure and pay to change my return date and book a new departure flight and I would be fine. Flew to Lisbon no problem and upon departure back to Manchester was told my return flight (which I had paid to change) had been cancelled when I cancelled my original departure fight. Had to pay for a new flight on the spot and customer service would do nothing for me. Four plane tickets later... I’m not sure going to Lisbon for the weekend was worth the cost of the flights and will avoid TAP airlines from now if I can. I thought Star Alliance comapnies had higher standards.

### "has ignored my expense claim"
Not Verified |  Flight got cancelled a day before departure. Alternative options led to over EUR 600 expenses. Airline had terrible service to address problem, Non acting accordance to EU regulation and has ignored my expense claim for over 14 weeks (law requires them to respond within 6 weeks). Furthermore, they make it impossible to reach them by telephone - wait time on call over an hour - when answered they refer you to different departments with the hope that I will give up trying to get hold of them.

### "flight was suddenly cancelled"
Newark to A Coruña via Lisbon. My flight was suddenly cancelled, no information was given to us (No email, sms, or app notification). I was booked next day, arriving home more than 24h later and stopping twice instead of once, going first to Boston -  only one hour was given in Boston, where is necessary to go out of the terminal, getting in a bus, arriving to next terminal (from B to E) and passing security control. As the European Union Law says, after my official complaint I am waiting for compensation, but this airline is still not answering.

### "Staff was very nice"
Lisbon to Frankfurt. Flight was right on time, both on departure and arrival. Staff was very nice. The meal - a sandwich - was satisfactory. The only thing I don't understand is why I got a window seat automatically assigned when I have an aisle seat on my preferences in the system.

### "Worst customer service"
Lisbon to Moscow. Worst customer service ever. Asked the passengers to board the flight and then suddenly told everyone to return back to the gate. This is all at 23:14 on a Friday evening for a 6 hour flight. No explanations offered besides a vague reference to a “technical problem”’ absolutely no communication to the passengers. We feel like a herd of sheep. No update as to how long it would take to fix the issue or replace the plane. Airlines staff just retreated.

### "appalled by their customer service"
Not Verified |  I was supposed to fly from Lisbon to Milan via Porto. The flight was supposed to be at 4, but at 3.50 I asked the agents at the gate what i should do because i wouldn’t make to the next flight. They gave me a ticket to Milan arriving at 00.30: that means taking a taxi (95 euros) as well as wasting a whole afternoon. I was just appalled by their customer service.

### "seats were very comfortable"
I had a flight from Prague to Lisbon, and the flight was amazing, the cabin was very new and clean. The food was a very good and big sandwich with ham, cheese and lettuce, the seats were very comfortable, and the plane had many magazines that could entertain! I recommened TAP Portugal.

### "most dishonest airline"
Rome to Lisbon. TAP has to be one of the worst and most dishonest airline Ive ever dealt with. I booked two separate flights FCO-LIS, and LIS-VIE. My flight from FCO-LIS was changed to an outsourced air charter outfit, and I was downgraded to economy. When I enquired about getting a refund of the fare diff between business and economy (which would have been half the fare or about $280), I was told to ask at the airport in LIS.At LIS, I was told to talk to my travel agent with whom I booked the ticket through (Amex Travel), which I did. After 6 months of constantly chasing it up, I was told the airline had denied my claim. WTF? How can any company even get away with something like this? You cant legally sell a J ticket, fail to honour it by downgrading your customer and then deny a refund of the fare differential. Needless to say, I wont be flying TAP ever again, and I would recommend everyone else avoids this dishonest airline like the plague.

### "Overall good service"
New York to Paris via Lisbon in April 2018. Good service, friendly flight attendants. No delay on any of 4 flight segments. Full meal service on transatlantic flights, sandwich is served on short flights within Europe. Fast immigration clearance in Lisbon when entering and leaving from outside Schengen and convenient transfer to your final destination Decent IFE. Overall good service and I would fly this airline again when traveling from USA to anywhere in Europe. Another valuable information: they offer free stopover in Lisbon or Porto.

### "TAP  lags very far behind."
Porto to Faro via Lisbon. I have had my share of delays/airline and airport experiences and understand delays. TAP Portugal so far has been underwhelming and disappointing; I will not book TAP Portugal  again. There is no focus on the customer and most importantly customer communication. I booked my flight from Porto to Faro via Lisbon to avoid the late night Ryanair experience, the only other alternative (ryanair would have been a direct 1.5 hour flight later in the day with an arrival around 11:30 pm) I did not want my family to have to pick me up late at night - so opted for Tap and 5:30 pm arrival. The price difference between Ryan Air and Tap was 100% +-> Tap is 2x++ the Ryanair price. My flight was delayed by > 1 hour, I did not make my connecting flight. TAP Portugal knew of the delay when I checked in, did not communicate it and could have booked me on a flight to Lisbon 10 minutes later than my scheduled departure, which flight left on time and I would have made my connection. However it did not - nor did it communicate the delay until the last minute - we stood for 25 minutes in boarding bridge after the plane had been cleaned and fueled - why was that. In the end I had a 7 hour layover in Lisbon and arrived at an hour that my family cannot pick me up and incur a 50 euro or more cab fare. A little bit of foresight and this could have been avoided. When I asked the TAP Portugal crew if those with connections might be allowed to disembark ahead of the others (which I have found to be quite common in my travels) I was met with blank stares. I also do not understand how we disembark from the rear when the premium and business seats are at the front - go figure - you pay more and you get off the plane later?? When I asked for Tap for assistance in Lisbon with transportation at the transfer counter - same poor response - as in this is “my” problem. Lastly the only snack served on the flight was an ice cream covered with nuts. I have seen the commentary on those with a lactose intolerance and vegetarians - I have a serious nut allergy. That I or others might be allergic to nuts seemed to come as a complete surprise to the crew. In a competitive world where customer service is important, I am sorry to say that TAP Portugal lags very far behind. I have never been prompted to write an airline review. However the service was so mediocre that I thought I should chime in.

### "treatment and help was very bad"
Lisbon to Nice. I forgot a ebook (kindle) in the pocket of the front seat, which is of course my responsibility. One hour later after I realized it, I tried to call them so many times but they said the office was close on weekend, and to call back on Monday. On Monday i called but they made no effort to help me. Normally the cleaning staff is supposed to check every pocket and check forgotten items at the same time. Nevertheless, in some case, they don’t have much time which is understandable. So i asked them to contact the person that was seated to my seat after me, but they didn't want to help me and they hanged the phone. It shows really the behavior of a cheap airline, not customer focus, where staff are not keen to do the extra miles to help customers. Overall i don’t recommend this airline where the treatment and the help was very bad.

### "never fly with TAP again"
Lisbon to London City. My choice of airline was merely due to the fact that I could depart and return from City Airport. As far as I understand TAP is the national Portuguese air line company and as such (exactly like BA, Air France and so on) it costs a bit more but the customer is happy to pay a bit more because of the quality of the service. Well, I was shocked when I realised that on the flight London/Lisbon and back they don’t provide food for vegetarians (and they hadn’t run out). It’s a 2.5 hours flight but there is no food available for vegetarians. Not even a bag of crisps. Not even for sale. The only option available is a chicken seeded roll. This means that all the people that are allergic to nuts are not provided with food either. And again, the sandwich contains cheese,  people who are allergic to dairy are left with no food either. I think that in 2018 this is ridiculous and I will never fly with TAP ever again and I will not recommend you to any of my colleagues or friends. You really should be ashamed and you are not representative at all of the beautiful, welcoming and friendly country that is Portugal.

### "Avoid if possible!"
We were supposed to fly with TAP from Lisbon to Brussels. Upon check-in, we were told that the flight was overbooked by 14 (!) persons, although the company was still selling tickets on-line for the same flight. Also the other two flights to Brussels were overbooked, as TAP apparently overbooks ALL of its flights by 10%. A solution proposed by us (flying with partner organisation Lufthansa 30 minutes later via Frankfurt) was denied, as we first had to wait before our own delayed airplane had departed before they could rebook us. By that time also the Lufthansa flight had taken off. Hence we had to stay overnight, but the main problems only occurred when we had to contact the rude TAP-staff at the airport. It took us 4h to receive the hotel / food vouchers and the compensation according to the EU regulations (initially they only wanted to provide TAP-vouchers, only after reading out at loud the regulations they became somewhat more lenient). All in all, it's like flying with a low-cost carrier, but for a far higher price. Avoid if possible!

### "worst airline I have ever used"
London to Dakar via Lisbon. The worst airline I have ever used. Customer service non-existent! The lack of customer care and transparency is appalling. I have been trying to receive a compensation for 6 months, but the airline would not even follow basic EU laws in accordance to the EU Regulation (EC) 261/2004. TAP failed completely in providing us with meals and refreshments in a reasonable relation to the waiting time. On April 13, I was informed at the check-in, lest than hours before departure, that my flight was cancelled. All passengers waited until midnight to be put on a bus and dispatched to various hotels. The hotel I ended staying at was slummys. In the meantime, I was not contacted by the airline to let me know what was going to happen next. On April 14, we were transported back to Dakar airport at 2pm where we found out that the rerouting had not been done yet. We got told to wait for the system to update the rerouting for all passengers. We were all supposed to board on the 5pm flight to Lisbon, but a dozen of passengers, including myself, were denied boarding despite the numerous seats available. TAP failed in offering free of charge two telephone calls, telex or fax messages, or e-mails. After I was denied boarding, I was forced to wait for 6 hours in Dakar airport, time during which we received no assistance from your company. I asked several times to receive the two free phone-calls but I was denied this assistance. TAP failed in providing us with meals and refreshments in a reasonable relation to the waiting time. During the six-hour wait, we were not given any food or water, despite our several requests and families waiting with young children. TAP did not contact me in any way informing of the new flight/re-routing; not one email apologising for the cancellation or the inconvenience caused. We were forced to sit on the floor for 6 hours, with no access to the internet. TAP failed to provide me with a rerouting to the final destination at the earliest opportunity or, if I prefer, at a later date. In effect, the only re-routing offered was extremely inconvenient as it was forcing me to fly 48 hours after the original flight, via Paris and Brussels, including another 7-hour waiting time at Brussels airport. I had to pay 345 Euros to take a Eurostar train from Paris to London. I request the entitled compensation of 600 Euros and my Eurostar ticket fully reimbursed given the numerous failures to meet EU regulations.

### "staff was kind and helpful"
Paris to Bucharest via Lisbon. After the nightmare experienced with Icelandair, TAP airline made my day. The staff was kind and helpful. They offered a great meal with choices of alcoholic and non alcoholic beverages. Time to time they checked on passengers if they need something. Great job TAP! The services that I received made my mind to have my next vacation in Portugal.

### "they looked after everything"
Valencia to Casablanca via Lisbon. Our flight was delayed so we missed our connection. They arranged everything ahead for us, including a 4 star hotel overnight with meals, hotel transfers, airport meal vouchers and a flight the next day. Our luggage went straight through so we didn't have to check in again. Great experience, they looked after everything and would use them again!

### "recommend this airline"
Köln to Lisbon. A good experience with Tap. Unusual huge legroom with a 2-2 seating. Crew polite, helpful and very professional. Meal service is a roll and a small bag either salty crackers or sweet cookie. Complimentary beverages are served including wine as alcoholic option. Flight on time. Excellent price for value and definitely recommend this airline.

### "customer service nonexistent"
Helsinki to Porto via Lisbon. My checked baggage was damaged and lost on the way from Helsinki to Porto - only one piece of three came through to the final destination at Porto. We had baby strollers and a cabin sized bag and a camera tripod tied firmly into them with cargo straps, but somewhere on the way (presumably at Lisbon) someone had removed the cargo strap and the cabin bag and simply left them out. Upon arriving at Porto airport I filed a lost luggage complaint, which was marked as resolved closed by Groundforce the next day without ever delivering the bag to me - the camera tripod was however found and delivered. Hours of calling around did not get us anywhere - Groundforce says they cannot reopen the lost items ticket even though they made a mistake closing it and it is now TAP Air Portugal's responsibility. TAP Air Portugal initially refused any responsibility but eventually advised to make a complaint of the lost luggage - which we did. It turns out the airline does not proess these complaints, or it may take up to year to do so - during which time nobody is looking for the bag and it might end up sold in an auction before anyone even reads my complaint. Nobody at the airport will look for the bag without an open lost items case and nobody cares enough to reopen my case or open a new one and thus my bag seems to be lost forever because of the process and TAP Air Portugal's complete lack of interest towards customer satisfaction. I did not get my preordered vegetarian on the flight either - the cabin crew just said they were not informed such an order had been placed, although I was able to produce a confirmation from the airline stating it had. So their internal communication is a mess. On social media they just repeat how they will respond as soon as possible or are waiting for a reply from the proper department - in my case for over two weeks now - so if even their internal communication in simple issues takes weeks, one can only guess how bad the situation really is. Long story short - flights often delayed, customer service nonexistent. Your best bet: Take Another Plane, as people say on their Facebook page.

### "it was not a bad flight"
Gatwick to Oporto. For a short haul flight of just over 2 hours it was not a bad flight. Check-in at LGW was easy. Boarding was orderly and on time. The seat configuration is 3+3. The legroom is not too good but this was a short flight. There was no conventional type in-flight entertainment. The meal served was a roll with a choice of drinks including wine. As I said before it was a short-haul flight.

### "my hand luggage is not here"
Not Verified |  Worst experience ever. Just at the airport in Lisbon and my hand luggage is not here. Normally this type of bag should stay in the plane but they didn’t have enough space to carry all the hand luggage so they took mine away and now it’s lost. Pretty unorganised airline, I would recommend it at all.

### "my worst travel experience"
Luanda to São Paulo via Lisbon. So far one of my worst travel experience in Business Class. Aircraft of 25 years old with business class seat from decades poorly maintained. Food far from what the Portuguese gastronomy could offer. Flight entertainment on such aircraft are far from any others airlines. When buying airplane ticket on TAP may you have to travel on A340 my advise is to take another airlines. On A330 make sure you get the refurbish aircraft. It is a shame selling business class ticket at such price to offer a so poor flight experience!

### "They lost our luggage"
Faro to Barcelona via Lisbon. Never in my life would I let my enemies go to their vacation with TAP Portugal. Rude, clueless and uncaring employees across the organization. They lost our luggage, offered no support for us and kept giving us the runaround. The answer was sorry we cannot do anything for you and it was always us having to chase them around to be given incorrect answers. never in my life will I fly with this sad excuse of an airline again.

### "Worst company ever flown"
This company is the worst I ever flown. My ticket premium economy was confirmed and I was denied on the flight due overbooking. TAP always sell more tickets than seats available, during the summer and let many passengers on ground without re protection on the same day. They offered me hotel and compensation but the damage was huge for me professionally speaking. I slept 3 hrs to catch the next flight to Milano the day after and my hold luggage was lost. Worst company ever flown. Ground stuff rude and not willing to help pax remained on ground.

### "Avoid this airline at all cost"
Terrible! We left for a long awaited vacation Boston to Venice via Lisbon. We left Boston on time and were supposed to have a 70 minute layover in Lisbon but upon arrival our flight to Venice was boarding. TAP refused to let us board and re-booked us for a flight 8 hours later. When we finally arrived Venice we had no luggage. The people at the airport told us that there was no unclaimed luggage from TAP and sent us on our way. The next day we spent hours on the phone with TAP trying to track down our luggage and got nowhere! Every "customer service" person (except 1) was rude, incompetent, and not the least bit helpful! We were "accidentally" disconnected and told "NO" when requesting to speak with a supervisor. It was a complete exercise in, finger-pointing, frustration and huge run-around. We finally went back to the airport ourselves and one dedicated staffer helped us find our (now badly damaged!) luggage. We lost 1.5 days of a long awaited vacation because of TAP's carelessness, ignorance and sheer incompetence! We did also file a written complaint on TAP's "customer service" section of its website and a week later - still no response! Avoid this airline at all cost!

### "Cabin crew professional"
It is time for a positive review of TAP. Flew Lisbon to Amsterdam. If you book a "red" seat you will have lots of space for a comfortable flight. I fly often (gold flying blue, gold BA, gold Turkish) but always prefer TAP. Even in economy small nice meal. Cabin crew professional and I have always encountered helpful staff at contact center.

### "ignorant and indifferent"
Faro to Toronto via Lisbon. Staff wherever you go have an unmatched attitude. Ignorant and indifferent - start to finish! In every situation, they weren’t even trying but quick to give a sassy answer. Never again: avoid TAP at all costs!

### "has unreliable service"
I was flying with my girlfriend from Fes to London via Lisbon. The flight out of Fes was badly delayed, and no information was provided to any passengers or airport staff until after the scheduled take-off time, effectively preventing passengers from making any alternate arrangements or switching their flights or connections. The plane arrived after hours of delay, and flew in to Lisbon so late (on a Sunday night) that all connections had been missed. The replacement flights offered left Monday at noon, causing me to miss a day of work. I filed a complaint with the airline, which registered quickly on their system as having been received, but no progress has been made in the 140 days since the complaint was filed, and there has been no communication on when it will be reviewed. Since this incident, my girlfriend has had another flight badly delayed by TAP flying out of Dakar. In summary - the airline has unreliable service, and they provide no means for compensation. In the future, I ill be willing to pay double the price of a TAP offering in order to avoid them as a carrier.

### "customer services desk was closed"
Porto to Athens via Lisbon. The original flight from Porto to Lisbon was delayed for more than 1.5 hours resulting in me missing my connecting flight to Athens. The airline automatically booked me onto a flight to Athens via Frankfurt the next morning meaning I would arrive in Athens 11.5 hours later than my scheduled arrival. This massive delay resulted in me missing my booked onward journey by bus to my final destination in Greece. Furthermore once on the ground in Lisbon the TAP customer services desk was closed (as the time was past midnight) and I could not speak to anyone so as to get booked into a hotel for the night so I had to go through security once more using my new boarding pass to speak to the lost and found department staff that got me a hotel room. In the end (by this point the time was already 02.00 in the morning and my flight to Frankfurt was at 08.30) but no other food or drinks vouchers. Once I arrived in Athens I found out that my checked piece of luggage had been lost somewhere in this journey and so had to leave the airport with no clothes or essentials so as to at least be on time for my rebooked bus journey to my holiday destination. I have filed a claim for compensation and await the airline’s response.

### "almost 3 hours delayed"
Lisbon to Copenhagen. Flight is almost 3 hours delayed. The notice was first sent 1 hour before departure. Extremely long waiting time in the plane before take of and after landing. Spent more than 5 hours in the plane in stead of 3,5. The worst part that the seats were very small and without an option to lean them back.

### "flights are delayed"
Lisbon to Warsaw. Flight has delay. Crew very good, Food ok, Safety very good. Tap Portugal has only 1 big minus, flights are delayed. Once I had 3 hours once 1 hour, they put us into the aircraft and then flight commander told us we have to wait 1 hour after we can fly! They gave us only water to say sorry.

### "try to prevent my boarding"
Rio de Janeiro to Marseille via Lisbon. GIG-LIS flight went smoothly, from check-in to landing. Unfortunately TAP still uses old A340s with 160 inclination seats, and poor IFE. Connection in LIS was troublesome. Gate did not offer priority boarding at all. TAP cabin baggage allowance for business classes 2x8kg, and was guaranteed between GIG and LIS. But in LIS ground staff complained that I had 2 hand luggage and try to literally prevent my boarding, arguing that it was her privilege to decide about it; even rushed after me in the stairs leading to the bus. Very weird.

### "worse than a low cost"
Lisbon to Bucharest. Worst airline I’ve ever fly with, the seats configuration in the aircraft is horrible, if you’re above 1,80m height your knees will hit the seat in front of you. Food is very low quality, you cannot buy anything on board. This company is worse than a low cost company.

### "Easily the worst service"
London to Forteleza via Lisbon. Easily the worst service I have received. The T&C aren't clear enough, additional charges etc. Checking in and App experience is very poor, lots of problems and bugs. Long haul Inflight entertainment is very poor value for money. Screens are blurred, pixelated 20 years old. No charging points, no Inflight wifi. Seats are awful. I will avoid booking with TAP in the future, I would strongly recommend to look at alternatives. Poorly maintained airline and very poor value for money.

### "Shambles of a company"
Manchester to Lisbon. Shambles of a company! Delayed for 1h without notification, explanation or apology. Lost both my bags, had to wait 2h to report it, which meant i lost any transport to the city centre so i had to take a cab which cost me 30€ late at night alone. Got my bags back only 3 days later after calling them twice. To top it all off at my return flight they cancelled it in the last moment. Shambles, horrible experience. Sent them a complaint but they do not reply. They do not care about a paying customer.

### "didn't fly anything worse"
Stockholm to Lisbon. Departure late for 2 hours, no announcements, gates changed twice. Airplane food is atrocious, impossible to eat. Food service took long time, preparation for landing started 40min before landing, we were advised not to use toilets. Currently waiting for luggage for 30min. I am a frequent traveler and didn't fly anything worse then this airline so far. Hoping for my luggage will arrive.

### "poor English language skills"
London to Lisbon. Clean aircraft. Horrid, old A320. Non-adjustable, bolt upright and minimally cushioned seats. Economy standard seat pitch was just about OK for a 1m 75cm adult. Cabin crew friendly but poor English language skills. Announcements from cabin and cockpit were rendered incomprehensible by awful public announcement system and heavily accented English spoken at great speed. 30-ish minute departure delay made up almost entirely en route. Smooth flight. Complimentary snack and drink = Tuna roll, fruit juice, haribo-type sweets and a choice of soft drink, alcohol, tea/coffee. Most of the tuna rolls appeared to remain uneaten given the number they were throwing into the bin. Possibly the worst cup of tea I have ever been served anywhere in the world. (There is no dietary choice on TAP flights in Europe <4 hours duration). The soap dispenser in the toilet I used was empty (this on a mid-morning flight). I informed one of the cabin crew but he just shrugged his shoulders. Return flight from Lisbon: Clean aircraft. Nicer A320. Obviously been refurbished at some stage. Seats that you could actually sit on for 2+ hours and adjustable. Standard economy seat pitch same as outbound. Friendly staff with much better english language skills and a public announcement system that actually worked. A 30-ish minute departure delay again almost entirely made up en route. Smooth flight. Identical complimentary snacks to outbound trip. The majority of the tuna rolls once again seemed to end up in the bin. Why they waste so much money in this way is beyond me. No tea for me this time, I'd learnt my lesson. If there is no choice, just serve everyone a vegan snack like DLH do. Simples. Very generous hold baggage allowance with TAP basic fares. All in all TAP was just about OK. With very little corporate effort and cost that OK could become good if they are so inclined.

### "Horrible service and airline"
Not Verified |  I wouldn’t recommend TAP to anyone. Horrible service and airline. TAP Portugal flights are often delayed, this happened to our flight. We had a connection in Lisbon and because our plane from Oslo was delayed, we couldn’t catch the other one. Staff were very rude, both the airplane crew and staff at airport. They didn’t give us information and when we asked they responded rudely. They sent us to a grotty hotel where staff were also very rude. We were hungry and tired and staff said we couldn’t eat because they didn’t have any meals at the time we got there. Back at the airport staff were rude again, they didn’t give us any information about gate and they didn’t even look at us before answering to any of our questions, and they only replied “I don’t know” to anything we asked. We lost one whole day of our holiday because of the delayed flight: I’m never flying TAP again nor will I recommend it to anyone! Better to pay a little more and get better service from other airlines.

### "most pleasant flight"
Porto to Amsterdam . Check in a breeze, boarding very organized, a smooth and most pleasant flight. Departed and arrived on-time. Seat pitch a bit tight. Lunch tasty with complimentary alcoholic drinks from the friendly cabin crew. Checked bags arrived undamaged. Many negative reviews of TAP but we could not fault them and they put our much higher ranked Australian national carrier to shame with both on ground, inflight service and food and beverages. I would certainly recommend them for short to medium haul flights.

### "disappointment with TAP"
I want to express my disappointment with TAP in regards to a cancelled flight to Lisbon earlier this morning. Additionally, there was lack of communication as we weren’t informed what so ever of the cancellation until check in by the extremely rude and unprofessional staff who refused to assist us in any way. The apparent reasoning of the cancellation was that there was no fuel which we find ridiculous as we have paid for a service to get to a destination, not wait around a lengthy day being sent from city to city in order to get to our final destination. We booked a direct flight and have been sent to Madrid 15 hours later. We were supposed to arrive in Lisbon at 8am and now being expected to arrive close to 12am the next day. We are very understanding to unfortunate circumstances occurring but this matter to us and many who have been in the same position is not unfortunate. It is pure unprofessionalism especially when many passengers of this flight were sent from counter to counter in order to try and seek a resolution. We are absolutely appalled and would not recommend TAP Air Portugal to anyone!! !

### "was very chaotic"
Lisbon to Funchal. The flight was due to leave at 11:10 pm but only took off at 00:40 of the following day. Everything was very chaotic and instead of using an available air bridge they used the bus to take passengers to a remote location where the plane was parked.

### "the flight was cancelled"
We were due to fly out of Faro to Frankfurt via Lisbon and then on to Vancouver. The flight was scheduled to leave around 8 am. At 3:30am we received an email telling us the flight was cancelled and they had cancelled all connecting flights. We were told the Faro-Lisbon flight was cancelled because they had no flight crew. We were put on a flight the next day but we lost our premium economy seats from Frankfurt to Vancouver because they were already full. We were seated in economy. The flight from Frankfurt to Vancouver was late and we missed our next flight to our home town outside of Vancouver. When I attempted to contact TAP I was told I had to deal with TAP USA. I filled out their form for compensation and submitted it with the receipts. I have now submitted their form 6 times. I received one reply stating that they could only compensate the premium economy miles and could credit our air miles. I replied that would be fine and got back an acknowledgment, in Portuguese, telling me to submit the form again. I did and received another form stating the time to respond had passed and I needed to submit it again. And still I wait. There is no question as to whether or not I would ever fly TAP again.

### "enjoyed our flight and recommend"
We flew from Lisbon to Casablanca with TAP. Check-in in Lisbon was quick and easy with a dedicated area for CIP. We found out that TAP recently opened a new lounge in Lisbon which was quite good. The offerings included a very broad selection of cold and warm food, as well as desserts. There was also a bar and a huge selection of well temperated wines for self-serve. The flight from Lisbon to Casablanca was some 90 minutes. Good food was served and a good variety of soft drinks, wines and spirits. Friendly crew. We enjoyed our flight and recommend TAP.

### "cancelled my flight"
Porto to London. TAP are utterly useless. They cancelled my flight with no warning and now refuse to either compensate me or listen to my complaint. When I went to the ticket desk at Porto airport to ask how I could get home they had nothing to say to me : they simply handed me a card with a link to a website which does not work and told me to complain. Do not fly with this airline.

### "value for money is very good"
Lisbon to Munich. The crew was nice and attentive. The food was very good and enough to eat. The selection of soft drinks, wines and liquors was above average. The interior of the aircraft was stylish and modern. The plane was not delayed. The lounge in Lisbon is very good. Very satisfied with TAP Air Portugal. I would choose them again which I actually just did: Our next flight to Dakar will also be with TAP because they have the best departure times and a very good service. The value for money is very good.

### "never use this airline again"
Vienna to New York via Lisbon. The flight from Vienna failed to make its connection at Lisbon and I was stranded overnight in Lisbon. The reason: the plane was not given enough fuel to remain in a circling patten over the Lisbon airport while it waited for the runway to become available, so without any explanation at the time, the pilot suddenly aborted the landing (about 3 min out) and flew instead to Faro. After some delay, we were told only that the aborted landing was due to 'restrictions at Lisbon). The plane sat on a runway in Faro for over an hour for refueling, upon which we returned to Lisbon. The entire experience was harrowing (primarily the suddenly aborted landing with delayed (and misleading) explanation. TAP refused to upgrade my seat to Business class as compensation for the harrowing experience and missed connection. I have lost hundreds of dollars in a missed hotel booking in NY and additional expenses incurred due to the failure of TAP to put sufficient fuel in its plane. TAP should know that delays are likely at the Lisbon airport. There is simply no excuse for what we went through and for the refusal to upgrade my seat on the delayed final leg. The only means of communication to try to get compensation is through their website which is unresponsive. I will never use this airline again.

### "Avoid this airline"
Brussels to Lisbon. I bought my tickets in February as I planned a long relax weekend with a friend departing Friday returning Monday. Friday Flight was departing at 6:20 am, I got an SMS on Thursday at 11PM that my flight was cancelled and I was rebooked on flight departing at 15:30 - so 1 day holiday down the drain. Monday I was meant to depart at 15:55, I got an SMS at 7am that my flight was cancelled and I was rebooked to 19:55 (the next day). My friend who lives in London and used BA left as scheduled. I had to pay for an additional hotel night and managed to catch a flight at 12:40 after calling customer service and demand they find a return even if on another airline. I had to lose another day of holiday. Customer service has no empathy, they are rude, and complain to you that they have too many calls. My view is don't cancel flights at the last minute and people will not call. TAP is shady, won't disclose reasons for cancellation and does not tell you about your rights (under EU 261), which they are obliged to under this legislation. I have filed a claim. I am wondering what reason they will advise: there are no non TAP strikes, no weather issues. Avoid this airline, 2 out of 2 flights failed

### "Staff very unfriendly"
Amsterdam to Recife via Lisbon. The first leg was delayed for 1 hour therefore misser connecting flight before they arrange a hotel I had to wait more then 4 hours. When they booked me on another flight I had a 24 hour delay. I had premium boarding which was ok however as soon as you approach the bus they make a selection again and premium boarding is useless. Staff very unfriendly same as quality of information. If I can choose another airline I will certainly do.

### "no alternative of rescheduling"
Funchal to Lisbon. They canceled my flight booked for 1st July while offering absolutely no explanation or presenting an apology. Actually I believe this airline has never heard of the concept of apologizing to their costumers who pay for their salaries. They sent me a SMS less than a week before the flight and offer no alternative of rescheduling it. Obviously this causes undue stress to passengers particularly in high season. Only fly with them if you need to. One month ago I have also receive a SMS informing that a flight would depart one day earlier which ended up being an inexcusable mistake. If you call them you will be one hour holding on the line and pay a lot.

### "enjoyed our TAP flight"
My wife and I used TAP to fly from Frankfurt to Casablanca via Lisbon. Instead of having a short connection between two flight we decided to have a 3-days stopover in Lisbon at no additional charge. The last time I flew with TAP was 20 years ago, so I was looking forward to this flight. At Frankfurt airport we used the Lufthansa Business Class Lounge prior to an on time departure. It is a good thing about TAP that they are in the Star Alliance and that they use Lufthansas facilities in Frankfurt. The aircraft was stylish and the seats were as comfortable as other business class seats are in Europe: The middle seat is kept free. I was amazed by the quality of their onboard product: The food was good and the selection of drinks also. TAP had a wine carte with Portuguese wines and different food options. The crew was very attentive. We really enjoyed our TAP flight and recommend them. No complaints from our side.

### "don’t fly TAP Portugal"
Boston to Milan via Lisbon. By far the absolute worst customer service I’ve ever experienced! If you have any other choice, don’t fly TAP Portugal. Flights were cancelled with no notification. It took multiple phone calls to straighten out. Extremely long hold times, and the telephone support people were quite rude and not helpful at all.

### "such a bad experience"
Flew with TAP from Rome to Lisbon. Flight was several hours delayed, no explanation or staff to answer questions. Plane interior was old and decrepit with broken chairs. I’m 1,95 tall and could not fit at all in their chairs. Overall such a bad experience that I will not fly TAP again.

### "every single flight delayed"
Porto to Brussels via Lisbon. I have travelled with TAP twice a month this year and every single flight I took were delayed. They are always late and you are almost always sure to miss your connection flight if you have one. To go to Porto I really advice you not to take TAP because it is a lost of time, you have a high probability to lose the connections. This company is a shame. The customer service is inefficient.

### "shocked by this experience"
I had to fly TAP Portugal 3 times in three days: 1 flight: suitcase lost on a 30 min internal flight from Lisbon to Faro! How they managed that is beyond me. Checked my bag same time as my friend, hers arrived, mine not. Second flight delayed 2.5 hours. Third flight a 6.30 am flight, I arrive to the airport at 5am to find my flight is simply cancelled. No explanation. They booked me on another flight. Initially I was flying to Kiev via Rome with a 2h 50min layover, they booked me on a flight via Frankfurt 1h layover. And what? Of course the flight is delayed 40 min! Not sure I will make my connecting flight, but either way avoid this airline. And the personnel just doesn't care, they are not informed, they don't know anything concerning reasons for cancellations or when the flight will actually depart and if it will depart at all. I'm shocked by this experience.

### "worst customer service"
Not Verified |  Probably the worst customer service in the last 5 years. Flight from Barcelona to Porto was cancelled. Was one of the lucky few to get booked into the next day flight. Other were re routed to other airports up 16h the next day. It took Tap 4h to take us to a Hotel for the night, only to find out no food or water. By this point any airport staff was gone. The hotel was also 35km from the Airport. The next day Tap had not organised anyone to pick up the passengers for the flights they had rebooked them on. In the end had to order taxis to get to the airport in time for flights. Through out this whole time not one person from Tap checked or apologised for the mess they had created. Not flying with them for a long time again.

### "I will not fly TAP"
Not Verified |  TAP Portugal failed to inform us of a significant change to our booking causing us to miss our flight. Attemps to communicate with them were worse than poor. 3 people on hold for over an hour and never got through, and Let Us Hear From You/Complaint Form on their website wouldn't accept California as a city within the USA. If I ever go back to Portugal I will not fly TAP.

### "normal flight for a budget airline"
Not Verified |  Amsterdam to Lisbon. Lately I flew with TAP Portugal and it was almost a nice flight, although the boarding was super slow. They offered a sandwich (two breads and two cheeses), an Actimel smoothie, and juice. The crew was friendly. Seats weren't movable but were comfortable. There were 2 charging plugs for 3 three people. Our flight was half an hour late. There was no Wi-Fi and inflight entertainment in Economy. A normal flight for a budget airline.

### "This airline is unacceptable"
Flew TAP Portugal from Lisbon to New York JFK. Staff have no customer service. All 4 flights delayed at least an hour. This airline is unacceptable. When you ask for assistance everyone washes their hands clean. To get retrospective help on travel incidences, you wait 50 minutes over the phone and they hang up.

### "Entertainment was helpful"
Newark to Lisbon. Base on my limited perception, staff did not hurry or took for granted passengers during the flight. Entertainment was helpful for the six hour plus duration flight. Boarding was organized, meals were ok for flights leaving from the US (flights leaving from Europe have better food quality). TAP flight leaving EWR reliable and punctual. Great service for the ticket price.

### "reliable and punctual"
Lisbon to Miami. Friendly staff , specially to handicap and elder passengers. Meal quality is good and plenty. Airplane is not fancy and entertainment can be improved - but flight was reliable and punctual.

### "The worst punctuality"
Malpensa to Faro via Lisbon. The worst punctuality airline ever. Never depart or arrive on time. Once again after arriving to Lisbon later than featured, the connection to Faro was delayed for 1 hour because of the staff was late. Good flight service, but quality/price/punctuality it is far from a good rate service. Will recommend only for internal flights in Portugal.

### "no response from TAP"
Budapest to Lisbon. Flight canceled, no response Our flight on 24.3.2018 was cancelled due to "incomplete crew" - we were rebooked for the next flight 24 hours later. Unfortunately, even 10 weeks after the opening of the complaint and repeated urges, there is no response from TAP.

### "unacceptable behavior"
Our initial flight on June 8, 2018 from Bucharest to Lisbon was cancelled just before checkin time without any explanation or prior notification. Due to rerouting we were forced to spend 9 hours in Madrid airport and arrived at Funchal with a 17 hr delay. We incurred additional €72.45 worth in expenses due to having to eat and drink in Madrid airport during the 9hr layover. When I tried to file a complaint at the TAP desk in Porto (Porto stop also part of the rerouting they did), the agent threatened to call the police if I don't leave the desk, and closed the office blinds so we can't file complaints. This is unacceptable behavior.

### "I lost the connection"
Not Verified |  Venice to Rio de Janeiro via Lisbon. Because of the delay of the Venice flight, I lost the connection and a 2 hours wait the hotel accommodation for the night. Finally they told me to get their bus for the hotel. There are several hotel walking distance by Airport. TAP decided to move us to an hotel on Fátima, 130 km far. Only one return bus at 10 am. But other passenger have flights before the bus departure. Totally crazy. Even the return flight from Lisbon to Venice had 1,5 hours delay. The worst company ever.

### "will try to avoid TAP "
Lyon to Lisbon. I’ve flown TAP before and avoid them if I can. This was for a business trip and I didn’t book the flight. Was supposed to fly from Lyon to Lisbon; flight cancelled and rerouted the next day from Lyon to Paris and Paris to Lisbon (rescheduling took 2 hours; only one person was helping the entire plane). I’m still waiting in Paris, a flight that is also delayed for 1.5 hours (and likely delayed more, as another flight from Paris to Lisbon was also cancelled). It’s also still uncertain whether I will actually get my luggage when I arrive in Lisbon. All in all, not a great experience and will try to avoid TAP as much as I can.

### "pleasant and inexpensive"
Stuttgart to Lisbon. The aircraft was in good condition and only a few years old. The departure and landing were on time. The drinks were, for a intra-European flight, sufficient and served in a moderate amount. Perhaps one should consider from the airline's side, preferring to distribute biscuits rather than dry breads. The flight crew was friendly and helpful. Overall, the flight can be described as pleasant and inexpensive.

### "offered an upgrade"
Lisbon to Stuttgart. The departure was delayed because of an overbooking of the airplane by approximately 45min. I was offered an upgrade into the Business Class. The drinks service was very good and the small meal was delicious. The seating was good. All in all a pleasant flight with very friendly on-board staff. The delay was overtaken by the pilots up to 10min.

### "enjoyed flying with TAP"
London Heathrow to Lisbon. I really enjoyed flying with TAP. Excellent experience. Pleasant check in staff. Flight was on time. No hassle boarding. Clean new plane. Sufficient leg room ( I am 179cm) sandwich smoothie coffee wine and sweets served by smiling attentive staff without charge. We landed on time. I will fly with Tap again. A positive experience.

### "I was shocked!"
Flew TAP Portugal Lyon to Lisboa in late May 2018. It was part of a larger trip NYC-Lisboa-Porto-Lyon-Lisboa-NYC. I flew 4 different airlines: Delta, Air France, Transavia and TAP Portugal. The first three airlines did not charge me for baggage. TAP was the only one. And while the usual fee is $25 for one checked piece, TAP had the gall to charge me $46 for one bag for a 2-hour flight that cost me about $60. I was shocked! I was unfamiliar with TAP so looked up their customer reviews. They are not good. No wonder. Never again. I ask you, TAP, is it worth ticking people off with your poor service and outrageous checked bag fees! Very short term thinking.

### "treats its passengers very poorly"
Lisbon to Funchal. I saw a senior female flight attendant loudly humiliate a business class passenger, in front of other passengers, because in her opinion he wouldn't pay attention to the safety instructions demonstration as he was watching something on his tablet. She said if something happens to the plane instead of adjusting the emergency mask on his nose and mouth he would adjust it somewhere else -  then left to the galley with a pretentious and condescending smile in her face. TAP treats its passengers very poorly. The catering was OK though but you wouldn't expect less if you paid 552 EUR, in and outbound, for two passengers on a domestic route of less than one hour and half in a country like Portugal. Prices get even higher as Summer approaches.

### "never book again with TAP"
I booked a flight from New York to Casablanca, with one stop in Lisbon - the second flight to Casablanca was cancelled 5 min before the boarding,. No one was in the office to answer our questions, we didn't receive any update on our emails or phones, after 15 min, 2 employees come to the office, they collect our passport and boarding pass, to give us a new one. The surprise is that they decide to send people with American and European passport on a direct flight after 3 hours, but for those who are holding Moroccan passeport they decide to send them to the longest flight ever (Lisbon-Dakkar, Dakkar-Casablanca) for about 16 hours. When I tried to talk to them one of the employees kick me out of the office. For sure I will never book a flight again with TAP.

### "Avoid at all costs"
Amsterdam to Lisbon. This has got to be one of the worst hidden costs and customer service airlines ever. We went to Eurovision - booked seats months early and paid for seat reservations. Both times we were moved substantially further back without any warning and TAP said it could not be helped. It is irrelevant to pay for a seat reservation - this airlines simply just takes your money and that's about it. I had to call to confirm this and found out that I was charged 49 EUR for 21 minutes while inside the EU (really, it's insane 2.50 a minute for the WORSE customer service?) -. This airline simply sucks. Avoid at all costs and fly another EU carrier.

### "stress that could be avoided"
Lisbon to Rio de Janiero. TAP refused to send directly my luggage to final destination; therefore I had to rush to checkin on this flight, go through security check, rush to immigration. They offered me a free stress that could be avoided. Seat 3A was great in new full flat configuration. Late departure (11:30 PM) and therefore late dinner (01:00AM), with no option of quick service made me give up of any kind of food. Arrival on time. Quick delivery of luggage.

### "baggage policy is hidden"
Marseille to Lisbon. A TAP baggage policy which is hidden. I was connecting in Lisbon with TAP, final destination being Brazil. I originally bought a Marseille-LIS (Y) and a LIS-GIG (C) separately, because I did not want to pay for Business class on a domestic European flight, and I wanted a Business class on the intercontinental part. Doing so, I saved E400,00. TAP attendant and supervisors refused to send my luggage directly to Rio. They admitted they would do it if I were on an other airline from Rio to Brazil. Note that I am a Star Alliance Gold card holder. Why ? TAP has a brand new policy regarding luggages that will surprise a lot of passengers: if you connect in Lisbon from a TAP flight to another TAP flight, with two different tickets, your luggage will NOT be transferred to the second flight. You will have to collect it in Lisbon, check-in again, go to security again.. If your second flight is not a TAP ticket, your luggage will be transferred ! !!! They admitted that this resulted from tariffs. Many times MRS-LIS and LIS-GIG is cheaper that MRS-LIS-GIG. And the company wants to fight with smart passengers. I had 4 hours connection in LIS. I did not like it, but I felt safe. Arrival of the plane in Marseille was one hour late, and took off 2 hours late. I made it. Comfortable leather seats with a huge pitch. Sandwich and beverages including complimentary wine.

### "complicate baggage every time"
Lisbon to Frankfurt. I have flown with TAP several times when going to Brazil kitesurfing. Somehow this airline manage to complicate baggage every single time. This time when returning from Lisbon at check-in they say that we need to pay for our checked-in luggage despite that the our tickets specifically says it includes 1 checked-in luggage and 1 carry-on luggage per passenger. Instead we receive a note that we need to present to TAP baggage-service desk so they can "clear" that status in the system. Arriving at the service desk there is a line of 6-7 people in front of us, despite this we are stuck there waiting 1 hour before it is our turn. Behind us people are cutting in line and tempers are flaring up amount waiting passengers to the boiling point. You know what TAP, how about queue tickets? That would sort out people cutting in line. If you also assign more people to the service desk, things would go more smoothly. Even better stop screwing up the trips of you customers . Well, arriving at the desk I present the note I received at the check-in counter, and the lady at the service desk looks at the desk and starts typing at her computer. Then she says: "You need to pay for your luggage". I say "No. I have booked ticket where this luggage is included in the trip, and furthermore the woman at the check-in said we just had to show this note here, so you could "check-out" this in your system". At which the service desk woman replied rolled her eyes and replied with a grunt: "They always do this", hinting to the employees at the check-in. After 5 more long minutes things finally sorted it self out and we could set off running to pass through security and head for the gate in order not to miss our flight. This is just one of many similar issues I have experienced with TAP, beside that they seem to never leave on time. Their customer support is poor and they seem not to be able to cooperate with the other members of the "Star alliance" Fortunately there have arrived competitors flying to the best kitesurfing destinations in Brazil, so I highly doubt I will use TAP in the future.

### "It was really shameful"
Lisbon to Rio de Janeiro and despite an high-price for a off season ticket when I got on the plane it seemed like going back 15 years. The plane was so old that the screen was really tiny (maybe 15 cm x 15 cm) and seats were very old with little space for legs, while inflight entertainment was almost nonexistent, with 3 channels (channel 1 movies, channel 2 music, channel 3 cartoons) going through rotation without the possibility of any choice. There wasn't food choice, just 1 option: meat. I think that in 2018 is not possible to use a plane so old, it was like going back to the beginning of 2000. It was really shameful.

### "onboard service terrible"
Porto to Gatwick and never again! Called through to the gate on time but then waited for over an hour without being told anything by staff as to reason for delay. Finally bundled on to the plane - seats very hard and uncomfortable and onboard service terrible. Snack" arrived (almost thrown at you) and cabin staff seemed surprised when I declined. My wife took hers and regretted it. During all cabin announcements there was no mention of the delay as is it was all normal. This was even worse than the flight out 2 weeks earlier when at least the crew were more friendly. Still same issue with seat comfort although different plane. The only good points were that the Check In staff for both flights were efficient and friendly. TAP have now gone to the top of my Do Not Fly list.

### "I do not recommend TAP"
Warsaw to Lisbon. This should be a cheap airline, and it is expensive. First, the quality of the chair and leg room. The flight from Warsaw to Lisbon lasts almost 4 hours, the position of the chair can not be changed. I am 1.76m and barely fit my legs. Only the service and offer of the meal was ok. However, the return flight was canceled. For the first 4 hours after canceling the flight there was complete chaos. A gigantic queue to the TAP ticket kiosk. Nobody knew anything. We were sent from one place to another to find out that we were to return to the previous place. Finally, we received a return offer to Warsaw. The line gave us a trip after 13 hours waiting time from the hour of departure. We were offered a flight with stop with waiting time of another 9 hours at another airport. In total, the return was to last 15 hours. We gave up this offer and bought a ticket for another airline that offered a quick return home. It has been over 34 days to file a complaint and a request for compensation. There is no reaction to this day. I do not recommend TAP.

### "TAP does a great job"
Porto to Ponta Delgada. Booking for this flight was simple and I got a good deal. Just wish they would let you add your pets at booking straight away. I chose this flight over a Azores Airlines flight which I had booked and then decided to cancel because Azores Airlines had the wrong or insufficient information about the flight, and it was misleading and when I realised I was getting what I was paying for, I decided to cancel and opted out for TAP. Good thing I did that! Boarding was simple and fast, after all it was relatively small plane and ground crew was efficient and friendly. To help boarding even further, they did this by zones, meaning when you got to your seat it was super easy to get a place for your bags and to seat down. Cabin staff was very friendly and the plane was spot on clean. Almost looked new. Seats were comfortable, of the new thinner type which let you have some extra leg room but I would recommend the front seats as they are more comfortable with more adjusting options. The cabin looked amazing in black, red and green, very fresh and modern. It was one of the first direct flights from OPO to PDL that this company had but I do fly this route a lot with Azores and Ryanair and I must say that TAP does a great job, being more on time than Azores, cheaper and having more comfort than Ryanair. I would say it is the best choice, if you are not on a budget. Be aware there is no inflight entertainment or wifi. Food was ok, just a sandwich, a drink and coffee but it tasted ok. Flight was smooth, arriving and departing on time. We had our bags almost immediately after getting to the aiport. All in all great flight! I was absolutelly tired and was able to relax a bit during the flight, with zero concerns.

### "Love to fly with them"
It was a simple, short commuter flight from Lisbon to Porto but it was very pleasant. Departure was on time, as always. Fast and efficient boarding, nice clean plane, seats were ok, not very spacious but this is a small plane, so you couldn't really expect much more. Friendly crew, helpful and efficient. Taking off is painful on this propeller planes, at the beginning they sound terrible, almost like a buffering sound that gets into your ears, then they stabilize and they are simple, quiet and efficient. Love to fly with them. The view was amazing, overlooking the Tejo river, Serra da Estrela and Mondego river! Food was just a simple small snack, a pastry and a drink, maybe also coffee, I don't remember. There is no wifi or any form of inflight entertainment but on a commuter flight you don't really need it anyway. It was a short, smooth flight, we arrived on time and getting bags was very fast. Would recommend it anytime!

### "crew were very friendly and efficient"
Booking was simple and very easy to get the flight I wanted from for a decent price, I just wish I could have added my pet directly at the booking process. Online check-in was ok. It could be better. As I was travelling with an animal, they wouldn't let me have an electronic ticket at the end of the online check in process but as this was not very well explained, it almost looked like something went wrong with the process. Dropping off bags and collecting my ticket at the counter was simple and fast. Boarding was as simple as it gets: they boarded people by zones so it was very fast and once in the plane, it was very easy to get to the seat and find a place for the bags. Overhead bins had enough room, as it is typical for Airbus planes. Seats were comfortable and as they were of the new thinner type, there was a little bit of extra leg and knee room. Nice! Cabin colours are nice and refreshing, I liked it a lot. Cabin crew were very friendly and efficient, always smilling. Just a shame there was no inflight entertainment. Food was not great but it was decent for a 2h flight: very fresh bread with seeds for the sandwich, a pastry, a drink and coffee. We had departed on time and so arrived on time, as it is usual for TAP. Very pleasant flight from Ponta Delgada to Lisbon.

### "the cabin crew were fantastic"
My expreience with TAP was quite decent, it was my first time flying with this airline. My first flight was from Madrid to Lisbon, that got a 2 hours 30 minutes delay because the aircraft had an issue and also a pilot and a cabin crew were missing. When they announced that the flight was delayed, they were so responsible and they immediately started giving coupons (vouchers) for food at an eating point near the gate. When the plane arrived the crew started boarding inmediately and it only took 10 minutes to fully board the plane, they did a superb job! After that the Captain announced that we had to stay at the gate for 10 more minutes because they were still loading the suitcases inside the plane, the ground services here in Madrid (groundforce) are terrible. After that we got another delay because the control tower changed the runway configuration of the airport, and that delayed the flight another 10 minutes and after that announcement I started to get a bit nervous because I was worried about missing my connecting flight to Geneva. Then we took off and the snack sevice started, it was amazing to have a snack and a choice of drink on a 50 minute flight! Also the cabin crew were fantastic and they were also very friendly. But I found an issue between the cabin crew and the passengers because most of the passengers were Spanish and not one of the cabin crew spoke Spanish. Then we arrived in Lisbon and we had a bus transfer to the terminal because Lisbon doesn't have many jet bridges. After that I passed security and I ran to my gate because boarding had already started. After boarding everything went perfectly, the crew were friendly and helpful and thay did a great service during the flight, they served a light lunch that was decent and they served one beverage of choice (they also offered wine) and coffee/tea. The flight from Lisbon to Geneva departed ahead the scheduled time and arrived 30 minutes before scheduled! By the way the Embraer 195 was a very comfortable aircraft, the seats were wide and the aircraft was moedrn. The Airbus A320 had new seats, that were comfortable but there was no recline in economy seats, that made me remember the horrible Ryanair seats. My experience was decent and the flights were cheap, I will definately fly with TAP again if I have the chance but if they want to grow they have to improve.

### "not recommend this airline"
I flew from Munich to Rio and back to Munich again. Three of the four flights where delayed and one was cancelled. When I flew from Munich to Rio via Lisbon the flight was delayed for over an hour and I almost lost my connection flight. The crew was not helpful and they didn't seem to care that I almost missed the flight. Also the plane was dirty and smelled bad. They did not even provide a screen for entertainment on the long flight. On the way back my flight from Lisbon to Munich was cancelled due to technical problems. I would not recommend this airline.

### "Not a recommendable experience"
Rome to Brasília via Lisbon. Not a recommendable experience at all, although the friendliness and helpfulness of the cabin crew which is really good. Ground staff in Rome was rude and inflexible. Tickets don't include seating options. For each flight you pay extra to change seats and as a couple you are by default placed in the middle of the middle row to force you to spend money to change seats. Luggage needs to be paid for dearly as well. The Airbus 320 is with a modern cabin layout, the seats are good. The A330 are old, smelly and with the worst seats I've ever sat in. For an Intercontinental flight unbearable. In flight entertainment is okay-ish but there could be more options. Flying to Brazil unfortunately the options are limited, so I'll be most likely forced to use TAP again. Wouldn't recommend if you can avoid.

### "delayed every day"
TAP Portugal between Porto and Lisbon is delayed every day. If TAP Portugal provides a service with flights every hour, it is unacceptable that they don't have the means to comply with the schedule. And this fact is quite obvious do to the recurrent problem.

### "They refuse to refund"
Lisbon to Barcelona. They refuse to refund. The aircraft is extremely old for flights out of Toronto. Flying economy is claustrophobic at best in horribly uncomfortable seats. We paid for an upgrade to exit row and confirmed with gate agent and they changed the aircraft and we ended 2 rows behind. On top of that we had 4 pieces of luggage which cost us $880 CDN roundtrip to checkin. That is highway robbery. I would never fly this airline again. Furthermore the customer service is the worst ever. We paid for "upgraded" seats to the middle of the exit row. Literally paid to sit in Row 25 only because the aircraft shown to us had availability in the exit row there. Confirmed with gate and wouldn't you know when we got on plane they changed the plane and we ended up 2 rows behind. Instead of fixing problem on plane, I had to call only to be redirected to send an email inquiry. Sent complaint March 22 and on May 1 no response. Called and finally my complaint was "expedited" only to be rejected because I got the row I asked for. Now you tell me who in there right mind pays to sit in Row 25? Should a passenger be responsible when the airline is the one that changed their aircraft? They refuse to refund. Literally refuse.

### "customer service awful"
Porto to Amsterdam. Customer service awful. My husband and I should have been returning home from Portugal today. Unforntunately he was in the hospital for the past 3 weeks with pneumonia. I immediately contacted TAP to cancel our ticket and see if we qualified for any refund. I was told I needed a note from the hospital verifying his hospitalisation. After two letters from the hospital (each time I was being asked for additional info) and three 20 minute long distance phone calls, I was finally told that since he was released the day before we were scheduled to fly home we were not eligible for any refund or credit. I am less angry at the outcome than the amount of time I wasted going through what they ultimately knew was going to be a negative answer? They knew what type of ticket I had, knew the regulations so why under an already stressful situation did they keep asking me for more information and asking me to call back. This is the second time we have had an unpleasant experience. We will never again fly TAP.

### "don’t have too many expectations"
Flew Manchester to Lisbon. Use only if no other option and don’t have too many expectations. No communication from TAP regarding delays and changes to your booked flight. Damaged bag on arrival. Only one sandwich (ham and cheese) option available - not because they ran out of other options but because that is the only option. No vegetarian option. Change to allocated seat - paid separately with no communication. This is because they changed airplane and operator with charter airline.

### "Most frustrating flights"
Amsterdam to Lisbon. Most frustrating flights in a long time - within a day of leaving Lisbon for Amsterdam we were notified that the return flight had been cancelled. No TAP contact details, no city office, no explanation, no optional alternatives. After a dozen calls (paid line) and 2 hours+ we finally managed to book another flight - whole service was worse than useless - it was also rude and abusive. The flight was not TAP but an Italian line Neosair and left 1.5 hrs late. Similarly the return from Amsterdam was over 2 hrs late. I would accept things can happens, but please try to inform staff of the whole situation and provide assistance to resolve the issue. I’ve not had this negative situation with many previous TAP flights.

### "one of the worst experiences"
Toronto to Prague via Lisbon. This one of the worst experiences I had ever. Firstly, when I bought the ticket on-line I din't see anywhere how much I have to pay for my baggage. I was surprised to find when I was about to drop it off at the airport that I have to pay an extra $120 for my only checked bag which I found to be outrageous. This was by far the highest baggage fee that I've ever paid. I was given the impression when I bought the ticket that I can make an early check-in which actually I did just to find later, on the flight day, that the seats that I've chosen were lost and eventually I've got new seats way back at the end of the plane. The only sort of better experience was that at the counter, that lady that took my baggage, gave me, at my request' a better seat. The last straw cane when we were announced that due to weather condition, the flight will be delayed by an hour and a half. Incidentally, other flights who were due to depart about the same time, left on-time. This made me to lose my connecting flight and my vacation started sour because of this guys. All my plans went astray since I've got to destination much later than planned.

### "was really rude to me"
Lisbon to Nantes. We ended up our nice holidays in Portugal with bad vibes and the staff definitely doesn’t reflect the friendliness of Portuguese people. 1h of delay (had to wait main of the time in the aircraft and they didn’t turn on the AC, everyone were so hot. The snack wasn’t tasty and they don’t have for vegetarian people. The flight attendants were so unfriendly, may be they should train them how to smile to the customers - one of the flight attendants was really rude to me. I was putting my feet/shoes on the back seat in the front of me (as I always do when I travel, it’s the first one someone say this to me). I’ve been surprise but the way she told me it was more surprising. We ended up our nice holidays in Portugal with bad vibes and the staff definitely doesn’t reflect the friendliness of Portuguese people.

### "very poor communication"
London to Casablanca via Lisbon. My flight was cancelled without notice on the 25th March. As I have checked in online and obtained my boarding pass, I went straight to the security only to be told there was a problem with my service. When I went to the TAP counter, I was told "Your flight has been cancelled, go to the Ticketing service and purchase a new flight. You better hurry, there's a long queue". When asked if I will get refund, the staff told me "I don't know, you should purchase a new ticket, that's what everyone's been doing". I was baffled, no apology nor explanation of cancellation. I never received any email or phone call informing me of any cancellation. When a flight is cancelled, the airline needs to rebook the passenger on to the next flight, and I was told to purchase a new ticket on the same day for 3x the price? I called their customer care and managed to have TAP rebook me on a different flight. However, when asked why the flight was cancelled, I was told that they are not aware of the reason as well. How is this even possible? 3 days later I am still trying to get the reason of cancellation. I have called customer service, sent complaint letter, sent email to their refunds department as instructed by their customer service. Very poor communication and customer service!! !

### "charming, helpful, professional and friendly"
I've always liked TAP Portugal. I’m flying between Central Europe and Portugal 3 to 4 times a year and I’ve never ever had a bad experience with TAP. This time from Lisbon to Vienna and back was no different. Flight back was delayed, however, information was sufficient and they apologised for the delay several times, including from the cockpit. Cabins of their planes are fresh and airy, seats brand new. The flight attendants were charming, helpful, professional and friendly, so that the whole atmosphere was welcoming and nice.

### "terrible experience"
Manchester to Porto via Lisbon. Terrible experience with TAP yet again. Delayed departure from Manchester meant that I had minutes to make a connection to Porto from Lisbon. The flight from Lisbon to Porto was then cancelled without reason. The only information I could get from the TAP staff is that they might be able to find a bus to put me on later that night about 4 hours after my scheduled departure. Basically I was abandoned and given no option of an alternative flight. They don't even give their customers the courtesy of responding to requests for flight refunds. I have basically been robbed of my money for the flight between Lisbon and Porto. Avoid this airline at all costs!

### "Vegetarians beware"
Flew Miami to Lisbon. Vegetarians beware! It seems that TAP Portugal sees being a vegetarian as some sort of special condition. There are no vegetarian meal options on board, they have to be ordered in advance as a "special meal". Apart from that the flight was fine although the inflight entertainment system seemed to have been installed in the early 90´s. The crew did their job thoroughly although a smile from the flight attendants here and there would certainly not hurt. Considering the reasonable fare I would fly TAP again but this time order my food in advance to avoid arriving hungry.

### "my TAP trip was superb"
I loved everything about my recent TAP experience flying from New York JFK to Lisbon . Having read many lukewarm to negative reviews about the airline I was hesitant about booking with them and only did so because they had the best price on a nonstop to Lisbon from New York (in Business Class). I approached the JFK with trepidation, wondering if I'd made a mistake. Not to worry, my experience was 100% positive and I'm frankly annoyed with the highly critical reviews I'd read. For that reason alone I have just joined Skytrax as a reviewer to give another perspective to future clients of TAP Portugal. My seat (2C) was the first in the row of Business Class, very comfortable and with extra storage space on the side surfaces. The pillow was soft and comfortable as was the blanket. My lie flat seat let me sleep with ease and the entertainment was superb. Virtually every new film of the past season was available-a fantastic selection. The flight attendants on both flights were charming, helpful, professional and friendly. I found myself thinking about (and quite bothered by) the negative reviews while I was onboard, being treated royally. Nonstop (no pun intended) smiling and service was what I encountered. So much so that I offered thanks while in flight on the way home. The Business Class lounge in Lisbon had outstanding, warm, just-cooked puff pastries both savory and sweet. Tray after tray came out of the kitchen-fresh and delicious. Composed salads, cheeses, drinks, I could go on and on about the free lounge selections. When I asked a cleaning person if I should bring my finished dishes over to where her cart was, she smiled at me and said no, she'd come over to where my plates were. Everyone was so hard-working and pleasant in the lounge. Much appreciated. The meals on the flight home were delicious, starting with a copious serving of smoked salmon and a delicious soup (choose the pasta entree!) All in all my TAP trip was superb and I highly recommend this airline to anyone considering flying with them.

### "airline is not good"
Lisbon to Fortaleza. This airline is not good but if you have a delay or cancelled trip you will really notice how bad it is. They just let you on your own and do not even give you a hotel even when you are more than 24 hours delayed. It's really worth to pay bit more for a western European airline.

### "customer service is terrible"
I booked my flight from Lisbon to London online, as there is no option to specifically add sports equipment I just added an additional bag (@ 60 Euros) to cover the piece of sports equipment I was travelling with. During check-in I was informed that sports equipment had to be paid for separately, this was to cost an additional 50 Euros. Rather than just use the additional baggage fee that I'd already paid I was made to pay again. It's now a month later and I'm still waiting for my initial 60 Euros to be refunded. TAP customer service is terrible!

### "Horrible on long haul flights"
Horrible on long haul flights! We flew from Munich to Rio de Janeiro via Lisbon and then back from Belo Horizonte also via Lisbon. The  planes were mostly very old (2x A330, 1x A320, 1x A321). The so called entertainment on board is at least 15 years old and a real joke. One can choose only from 3 or 5 different movies like on TV. None of the movies was new. The display was very small and the quality horrible. My headphone jack was broken so I could only hear on one side. Because of this I noticed 90% of the passengers did not use the entertainment at all! My seat was also broken and not adjustable. I did not sleep a single minute during a 9 hour night flight. Leg room was very small too. We got seats in the middle of the plane. Other seats, even the normal ones at the windows, cost extra money! Food quality also very low. Only one menu was available: "Beef. There is no choice. Service was slow but friendly. The air was so dry, the crew told us they are sorry but there is nothing they can do about it. Because of the dry air I had to drink a lot. Alcoholic beverages are limited to one beer per seat. At least both all flights arrived on time. If there is a choice I will book another airline next time.

### "Long delay"
Cabin staff were not willing to provide headphones for the entertainment system and we were told that it was not working. We used our own headphones at the end. Long delay (over two hours) on the return flight (Lisbon to Munich with TAP Portugal) and, although there was another flight, I was not given the chance to change the ticket.

### "Catastrophic new design"
Rio de Janeiro to Paris via Lisbon. From Rio de Janeiro to Lisbon, retrofitted A330. I thought I was lucky to get the seat 3J, "throne" type. Unfortunately, this is an extremely narrow configuration, albeit brand new design, that I would not recommend for passengers over 60kg (slim people would fit). Seat in itself should be OK, until you incline it; not only your feet, but also your legs are then trapped and you cannot move at all, with a claustrophobic sensation of coffin. Catastrophic new design. I noticed a strong improvement in dinner quality, as well as in drinks, but on the other hand breakfast was cold and ugly.Crew was young and efficient. Fortunately, from Lisbon to Paris, a short flight, a nice breakfast was served.

### "slow, impolite and not helpful"
Flew Fortaleza to Lisbon. After I had already checked in online, I had to wait for a very long time at the check-in counter for document verification. The staff were very slow, impolite and not helpful. I was informed that there is no business class lounge at the airport I could use. As compensation for the missing lounge, I asked for a voucher for a drink at the airport bar and was sent away without any voucher or anything at all, not even a "sorry". In the airplane during flight, no wifi available. Neither ground staff nor airplane crew speak English at any acceptable level.

### "Reasonably comfortable seats"
London Heathrow to Lisbon and back. Both flights were punctual, with friendly crews who dispensed a free snack and drink (including alcoholic). Reasonably comfortable seats with enough legroom. All for £100 return before paying for hold luggage. This is the second time I have flown this route and would be happy to use TAP again.

### "Was completely satisfied"
Flew TAP Portugal from Vienna to Lisbon. Was completely satisfied. Punctual take-off and landing. Kind and friendly on-board staff. No problems during the booking, check-in, or flight. Can only recommend to everyone, good Job! Pilot put down the plane in heavy wind in complete safety.

### "still really disappointed"
On our way from Düsseldorf to Praia on the Cap Verdes we stopped in Lisbon. Due to unknown reasons our plane took off late, resulting in us missing our connecting flight in Lisbon. We then had to spend the whole day there, missing one of the already paid vacation days which annoyed us, but hey, it happens. Like us, many others missed their connection. They gave us vouchers for the restaurants, all being typical fast food chains, as compensation. Few staff at the information desk took long to help everyone. On our way back we took the same route. With our plane already leaving Praia an hour late, we were scared the same thing might happen again. This was on a Sunday, we stayed up all night to get the flight and had to go to work on Monday of course, obviously this situation is inconvenient for anyone. Naturally we missed the connecting flight again, even though there was a two hour buffer. Okay, straight to the information desk again. There were so many people that missed their flights and one staff member tried to give people from all different kinds of cities in Europe new boarding passes, that apparently had missed their connection as well. There were again people who wanted to go to Praia (like us one week earlier) that had the same problem we did. I don’t know what the initial problems were for the delay, but this seems to be happening all the time. We are still really disappointed with the airline. Twice catching a flight in the middle of the night, twice missing the connection and losing two whole days can really annoy us.

### "will never  fly with TAP again!"
Rome to Madrid via Lisbon. TAP Portugal has ended our holiday with the most stressful and worst flying experience ever. Our flight from Rome to Madrid via Lisbon was a total nightmare. They couldn’t land in Lisbon due to airport congestion and poor weather conditions (fair enough) So we were diverted to Portugal airport to refuelled. We waited nearly two hours here! We missed our connecting flight to Madrid (9:15am) we didn’t land at Lisbon til 11:15am and evidently we missed our next flight home from Madrid to Sydney (2:15pm flight). We could’ve made that flight home if Tap Portugal has hold us once we got off the plane to go straight to transfer desk and book another flight to next available flight to Madrid but no no they made us followed them and we waited 1.5 hr to speak to someone by then it was too late. Tap Portugal you have the worst customer service, disorganised, no clear communication, and you can’t really deal with stressful situations. I will never  fly with TAP again! TAP caused us lot of stress and headache on the last day of our holiday which was supposed to end on a high note.

### "could have handled the situation better"
TAP Air Portugal seems to have a record of poorly timing their flights. My flight from Marrakech to Lisbon was delayed by nearly an hour, which meant there was no way I was going to make my connecting flight (also with TAP Air Portugal) from Lisbon to Milan. On the flight, the Economy options for food and drink were extremely limited. When I warned the flight attendant of my food allergy, they did not offer me any alternative. I am certain that all customers flying with TAP Air Portugal do not want a tuna sandwich on a bread with nuts and seeds. I missed my connecting flight by ten minutes, as did several other passengers who were connecting with TAP to Milan. They put us up at a hotel (standard procedure), but gave no explanation as to why our flight from Marrakech came in so late, and why the flight heading to Milan would not wait for us (there were nearly eight of us). Nothing went horribly wrong, but still, I feel that TAP Air Portugal could have handled the situation better.

### "crew is polite and attentive"
Lisbon to Frankfurt. Business class Check in at Lisbon Airport is on the main floor, but there are no clear indications. Courteous check in, fast and efficient. Could not check in online. Boarding was ok, a bit confused. Take off was on time. Business class is the same as economy, only the middle seat is empty. They serve lunch with 2 options. I do not drink alcohol, so can’t review the wines. Food was ok, nothing outstanding. Cabin crew is polite and attentive. Arrive on time in FRA.

### "always have an enjoyable experience"
Frequent flyer on "Ponte Aérea" over the last few months and always have an enjoyable experience. Staff always available and prompt to change my flight to an early on if there is availability of seats. The weather on the day of flight had been bad in the morning in Porto which caused several delays but everything was well informed and the staff was always trying to accelerate the boarding process as possible in order to reduce the successive delays. Nice staff, served a choice of savory/sweet snack and several options of drinks even for a 40min flight. Will keep my preference.

### "Try to avoid this company"
Prague to Lisbon. Selling so called "business", but you sitin standard economy and only advantage is that you don't need to pay for a seat selection or luggage. It's not even fast-track ready! The crew is so annoyed, unwelcome and they even don't want to use visit toilets by passengers in front of the aircraft as they wanted private - which is crazy, if you take you bought business and they told you "go on the back". And the fact they are not a cheap or low-cost company make this even worst. Try to avoid this company.

### "TAP product fell short"
London City to Lisbon. I decided to try this new route as I live close to London City. The booking process was easy but I was surprised when I checked in 24 hours before my flight (their website advertised 3 days check in which was not correct) I wasn't able to change my seat unless if I pay. The flight was delayed by around 30-40 mins and there was no communication before hand. The plane was ok - not particularly new or clean but the pitch was reasonable. I like the layout of E-190 as it's 2 seats each side. I have to say though that the seat was extremely hard and uncomfortable. Service was very minimum and not very professional. Overall an ok flight considering how easy City Airport is but TAP product fell short.

### "I will avoid using TAP."
I was supposed to travel from Lisbon back to London City as my returning leg. Checked in 24 hours ahead and assign my seat. I was planning to leave Lisbon city centre to the airport 2.5 hours ahead (as I was told the queue in the airport is long) and just wanted to confirm my seat while I was having lunch with friend. I noticed that they had change the airplane from E-190 to A320, and they have also changed the destination to London Heathrow. I understand that airlines have to cancel flights sometimes due to various reasons but it is unacceptable to do it without noticing passengers affected (and they put me on an earlier flight so I could have missed it). To be honest the onboard service was acceptable, the plane was spotless (but pitch was very tight and again very hard seats). The lack of communication is a let down and I will avoid using TAP. From Heathrow it took me an additional hour to reach home.

### "Never again with TAP"
I am very disappointed with TAP service. It's the worst that I have ever experienced. I bought my ticket in January and canceled the same day. I read that if you cancel within 24 hours the full refund will be issued. So I canceled. I did not recieve any cancelation proof, any document, any email. I called TAP Twice in both cases I waited 20 minutes for someone to talk with. I was informed that I will receive the refund within 30 days! Long but ok, I had to trust. I waited 30 days but the money did not appear on my paypal account, I gave TAP 6 days more and today I called again. After waiting 20 minutes someone picked up the phone and informed me that it's not 30 calendar days, it's business days! Never again with TAP.

### "spending half a day in a lobby"
Zurich to Dakar via Lisbon. Connection flight missed because of delayed first TAP flight, 24 hours delay. Provided hotel until noon next day, means spending half a day in a lobby (with a 6 year old child). Fine. Arrive at airport and ask for dinner vouchers, request denied. Airline feels very magnanimous for taking care of you for 12 of the 24 hours of your delay. Denies that any further compensation is in order, claims to be oblivious of laws on the subject. Seats were ok, and the wine is actually quite decent. Still, just don't.

### "unacceptable waiting times"
Porto to Lisbon. Queuing for the check in was absurdly long, with unacceptable waiting times and with no justification fro the delay. The flight was then delayed for more than 2h because of bad weather but communication with passengers was very poor. The Told me to go immediatly and as fast as I could to the gate, they gave me priority at security and only after I showed my ticket at the gate was I informed the plane was late. The plane was clean and modern, it was a nice and fast flight but the snaks were terrible, in quantity and quality. Luckily I had reserved enough time to get to my next flight or I would had missed it.

### "worst experience ever!"
Lisbon to Toronto. The worst experience ever! The airlines cancelled our tickets to fly back home without any warning, refused to help in any way, refused to put us on the next flight, made us pay for the new tickets. Customer service agents are mean and are not there to help you. I have never experience worse customer service, no understanding whatsoever.

### "no wi-fi or entertainment"
Lisbon to Ponta Delgada. Boarding was fast and simple and staff was efficient. On the plane, it was clean and well kept but it had the old, dull and less spacious cabin and I was hoping to get one with the new cabin. Crew was friendly. Food and beverages was a bit tasteless and very basic, not a good experience. The flight was calm, boring, with no wi-fi or entertainment. We arrived on time and luggage was delivered very swiftly.

### "flight was very enjoyable"
Lisbon to Porto. It was a connection flight so once our previous flight landed we were greeted by some staff to take us directly to this flight, so it would not be delayed. It was a nice and friendly gesture. The plane was very well kept and clean, although a little bit cramped as it is a small propeller plane but it comfortable and modern. They served us a «Pastel de Nata» and a drink and a complimentary small bottle of Licor Beirão, I think it was some advertising campaign for Licor Beirão but still it was a nice touch. Crew was nice and friendly and the flight was very enjoyable, flying low altitude and watching the beautiful landscapes.

### "disappointed with the plane"
Ponta Delgada to Lisbon. Check in was fast but not simple, I had already paid for my cat and at the check in they did not had access to it, although it was mandatory to pay in advance. Boarding was relatively fast and simple. The crew was friendly enough and was fast on serving the snacks. The light meal was ok, nothing special. I was very disappointed with the plane, it was in good condition and clean but it was the older, dull and not as spacious or comfortable cabin. With no entertainment or wi-fi. Flight was ok and we arrived almost in time.

### "service could not be worse"
Belo Horizonte to Lisbon. I had to change from business class to economy due to a broken seat. After 4 months and complaining several times I did not get an answer or an response. The service could not be worse. When I contacted them via facebook they always told me that they will contact the customer service but nothing happened.

### "I would fly TAP again"
Luxembourg to Funchal via Lisbon. I called the call center to ask about transfer time in Lisbon. The phone was answered very promptly in english by a polite lady, and i was told that 1hr 5 minutes was more than sufficient to change aircraft. All 4 flights left on time. The return flight from Madeira was 10 minutes late arriving due to a headwind. When I arrived in Lisbon I  noticed the flight to Luxembourg was departing gate 25 and we arrived gate 24. Transfer time 1 minute. This was a big relief. Lisbon terminal 1 has a food hall with a good selection of reasonably priced outlets including MacDonald, KFC, Paul bakery, sushi style place, etc. I did not check out the duty free shops. I got some chicken pasta and a coffee for about 10 euro. I used the online check in, and recieved a link in my sms to an online boarding pass that updated the gates in real time. The online link available by sms and in google assistant..had a different gate to the PDF boarding pass..so i highly recommend to get this boarding pass. For the price I paid  the service received was excellent. Yes it was hand luggage only ticket and the seats where a bit cramped but overall I would fly TAP again. Coffee, drinks and a sandwich on each of the 4 flights.

### "staff were really nice"
Warsaw to Lisbon. The staff were really nice, attentive, always ensuring everything was fine, but without being pushy. A true example of how service should be. Food was very good as well. I had some issues with my ticket, which got resolved by calling the support line. Although I had to call a second time to ensure everything was OK.

### "trained to be rude and snotty"
London to Lisbon. Check in staff did not tell me my flight was cancelled, simply booked me on a later flight with no warning. Did not offer meal voucher. Did not offer assistance. Did not offer phone or fax facilities. Went back later and they refused to hand over a compensation form - they lied and said they did not have to give me one. TAP dishonesty never ceases to amaze me, employees are trained to be rude and snotty.

### "the worst experience I have had"
Berlin to Miami via Lisbon. By far the worst experience I have had with an airline, I basically paid $90 for two seats and was never given the seats that I paid for even though I provided a receipt, my booking confirmation, and a printed boarding pass that said my seat number! The lady at the counter simply said that there was nothing she could do and we were given terrible seats far back on the plane, I obviously called customer service when I landed but it was impossible to get through to an agent, finally on my 7th try and after a 14min wait on hold someone answered (treated me very rudely) and gave me a case number. Its now been a month since the call and I have not received a call back, an email, or more importantly a refund for seats that I paid for but did not get, I have tried calling over and over but no one answers. Can an airline really get away with selling you something online and then not delivering what you paid for without even an explanation or some sort of resolution? If you can avoid flying with this company please do so.

### "cabin bag measure is insane"
Lisbon to Madrid. I mistakenly thought that this is not a low cost airline, which it is. If faced with a choice, use one of the known low cost like easyjet. They are better. TAPs cabin bag measure is insane! My laptop bag barely fits. The forced me to check in my cabin bag which was under 3 kilos, chosen to be as small as I could find, and with which I had flown as a cabin bag in 6 flights with 4 different airlines, both in USA and In Europe. Very rude staff, they claimed it is for security.

### "This company never ceases to amaze me"
Flew TAP Portugal from Lisbon to Funchal. This company never ceases to amaze me even though I frequently have to purchase tickets with them since from where I live they are the ones with the better schedules and flight frequencies. In our booking reservation we had two passengers with the same first and last name, without any previous asking they automatically assume this was a mistake and cancelled one of the tickets without any notice. After endless conversations on the phone, one hour waiting on their phone line - where it seems they have only one employee, and I am really not kidding, I have talked to the same Brazilian attendant before - and after being charged an extra 15€ on my mobile phone, they promised to solve the problem in 24h which they did – on the last minute of the deadline - after much anxiety and totally needless worry. Curious how they still charged my credit card 3 passengers, even though they cancelled one of the tickets. On this particular route they exert some commercial monopoly and take advantage of it by overcharging passengers. Their cabin crew are frequently pretentious and elitist, with no knowledge of customer service or multitasking. Their pre and post purchasing service is nightmarish, at best. People who like to fly in this company either fly very little or never flew in other companies before. I would highly advice against even getting close to the idea of booking with them. They will lessen your faith in humanity.

### "Food was really good, seats were new"
First Leg: Vienna-Miami: Food was really good, seats were new. Second Leg: Miami-Vienna: Old plane, very old seats, some seats were defect, therefore we had a delay. Nevertheless, food was great, service was ok. I guess TAP Portugal has to update their seats before I am flying again.

### "The worst experience ever"
Accra to London via Lisbon. The worst experience ever. Do not be fooled with buying a cheaper ticket with TAP  Portugal. No flight entertainment on both short and long term flights. They change travel to without informing passengers. Staff on the ground need training in customer service. Very robotic and some rude in mannerisms both Portugal and Ghana. On both journies there is only one person checking through security. Due to plane being far away from terminal and security you are bound to miss connecting flights if there is an hour apart. Ground staff appear not to be able to communicate together so the left not talking to right causing miss direction for travellers. You then get pushed from pillar to post and not given any options of your next connecting flight as stated in in their air passenger rights leaflet. Never again will I travel with them.

### "Don't fly on this airline"
Seville to Toronto via Lisbon. They charge you approx cad$100 per check in luggage each way. Can you imagine? It is an international flight, any person would naturally expect at least 1 luggage included per passenger already. Long and inefficient check in, and they overbooked. Don't fly on this airline, it will stress you out.

### "don't book with TAP Portugal"
Rio de Janeiro to Lisbon. I booked a flight at the end of January. As my plans changed I cancelled the flight on December 10th. This should be no problem as I booked a fully refundable flight. As I paid with credit card, the time for processing the refund was stated as 7 weekdays. I've been waiting more than double the time now and still not seeing any refund! So if you're a spontaneous person changing plans from time to time don't book with TAP Portugal!

### "never fly with them again"
Manchester to Toronto via Lisbon. Extremely rude staff at check in, apparently you need to check in online or you'll be verbally harassed by the check in staff member and threatened with losing your seat to an overbooked flight. was told that I was lucky to be let on my flight and was given the very last seat possible. funny because there were two empty seats in the row in front of me. I was charged twice for one bag to be checked, and when I asked for a receipt to confirm that the one payment didn't go through I was denied such confirmation and given a verbal assurance of "its fine don't worry about it" was sent to drop off bag without a boarding pass. when I went back to ask for the boarding pass, same employee was angry with me and acted annoyed as if I was inconveniencing her by needing a boarding pass to drop off my bag. Cabin staff were friendly and seemed to enjoy conversing with customers. too bad the ground staff ruined it for me. all in all, extremely unprofessional. Will never fly with them again. customers shouldn't be made to feel like they are an inconvenience for checking in to their flight.

### " worst airline I ever flew"
Lisbon to London. This is the worst airline I ever flew. Its poor customer service by far overshadows all other aspects of my interaction with the airline. LIS airport is poorly organized and has a second checkpoint after the duty free zone, which is clearly not obvious to have. The airline did not warn us at check-in about this checkpoint, and did not provide any help when we could not pass it fast enough. We still arrived to the gate 15 min before the departure and were denied boarding, even though the aircraft was there and had to wait to unload our luggage. About 7-8 other people were in the same position. The staff sent us to a customer support desk where we were denied service and were sent to a different desk, having to pass through passport control or security each time. Finally, we were forced to buy new tickets to take a flight. Not only no compensation was offered by the airline, but none of several TAP employees we talked to even expressed regret or apology !

### "the last time I fly TAP"
Lisbon to Seville. I paid additional money to be seated near the front of the plane but was given another seat when I checked in on the flight. I was not even told about the seat change therefore did not realize until I was on the plane. To make matters worse, they gave out the same seat to someone else. I had to wait until everyone was boarded until I could actually sit! I was not the only person on that flight this happened to. This will be the last time I fly TAP. No one even apologized.

### "the food was terrible"
Milan to Accra via Lisbon. I experienced many delays. The crew was nice but the food was terrible. And most important thing, after a quarrel with the ground attendant my hand luggage (safed with locker) was put in the hold, it was damaged.

### "TAP Portugal don't care"
Warsaw to Lisbon. I was flying with my ferret that according to TAP can only fly in the hold because "only dogs and cats can fly in the cabin". This is to ridiculous considering a ferret has a pet passport and is smaller than most both cats and dogs. I am writing this review to warn people when travelling with TAP. After landing, I first had to wait 55 min before picking up my animal and second I noticed that his drinking water was frozen. I confronted people at the airport of Lisbon but no one cared or tried to help me. I wrote a complaint but get to reaction. When calling them they first send me from one person to another and then simply put me on hold for 45 min. I am now on the phone (for the 4th time) trying to bring my ferret back home in the cabin and no one wants to help me out (I was told by tap ground crew members that they even let rabbits fly in the cabin). So bottom line, TAP don't care and don't want to help.

### "lack of professionalism"
Boston to Marrakech via Lisbon. I experienced significant delays, cancellations, and unexpected fees on all segments of my round trip on TAP Portugal. I am primarily disappointed by TAP’s disorganization and lack of professionalism in resolving delays and cancellations, rather than the delays and cancellations themselves. My flight from Lisbon to Marrakech was delayed for over 4 hours with no explanation or apology. The airline did not inform us that our flight would be delayed until its originally scheduled departure time, and they did not give an estimated time for departure until the flight was already delayed by 2 hours. Even after they allowed passengers to start boarding, they made priority boarding members (elderly, children, families, and people with disabilities) wait on a crowded bus in between the gate and the plane for over 20 minutes because our plane was still not ready. I thought I would be allowed to take one free checked bag, according to the TAP website (traveling from the U.S. to Morocco). My friend who arrived a few days later than me also traveling from the U.S. on TAP was allowed one free checked bag without question, but for some  reason, I was required to pay a fee of $90 for my checked bag. I submitted a complaint after my flights to Marrakech but received no response. I also paid a total of $100 for my round trip seat selection, only to have my selected seat changed unexpectedly on the way back from an aisle seat next to my travel partner in a row of 2 seats to a middle seat in a row of 4 seats, 10 rows in front of my travel partner. On outbound leg of the trip, my travel partner also paid an extra fee for an Economy Comfort seat only to show up to the airport and be assigned a regular Economy seat. When I arrived to the airport 2 hours before my return flight from Marrakech to Lisbon, we were informed by other passengers that our flight to Lisbon was canceled. At no point did we ever receive any electronic updates from TAP or in person communication from a TAP representative about our canceled flight. There was no explanation or information about rescheduled departure times. We had to wait for over 2 hours in a customer service line to rebook our flights. TAP is also not certified for U.S. pre-check or Global Entry, a minor convenience compared to the rest of my travel difficulties with TAP Portugal. I will never take this airline again - if I am ever given the choice between a less expensive fare on TAP Portugal and a more expensive flight on any other airline, I will take the other airline over TAP. I have never experienced such disorganization due to a delayed or cancelled flight before.

### "crew was the nicest"
Geneva to Sao Paulo via Lisbon. I was definately not expecting a higher level service as in some more high end airlines but I was surprised in many ways. Check in service overall very fast end efficient. The crew on the flight from Geneva to Lisbon was the nicest and smiliest I have ever seen in an airpline. Boarding process not without its troubles but overall more organized and faster than other airlines - they don't call you to board and keep you waiting oin line. On both flights they called us for boarding and ze boarded. I was assigned extra legroom seats on both flights and they were fantastic: felt wider than average and great leg room, plus support for the feet. Entetainment on board was excellent with very recent premieres. Finally, I ordered gluten free meals and had them served without questions, food was quite good and in very good quantity.

### "stewardess was surly and unhelpful"
Rio de Janeiro to  Gatwick via Lisbon. If you are flying TAP do not put anything under the seat in front, no matter what they say! My wife and I boarded a flight from Rio de Janeiro. We were one of the first on and my wife placed her coat and hat under the seat in front. Unknown to us, a late-arriving passenger then spotted the items and called a stewardess, who - without asking if they belonged to anyone - took them off the plane! We did not realise what had happened until we arrived in Lisbon. The stewardess was surly and unhelpful, implying that we should have heard and understood the (Portuguese) conversation taking place in the row ahead of us. TAP have since located the items in the lost luggage at Rio de Janeiro airport but are insisting that we organise and pay for a courier to have them returned. Every time we contact TAP they insist that we must have lost the items in the airport, so every time we have to explain again the sequence of events. The fact that the stewardess thought that the items had been left by a passenger on a previous flight also shows that security standards on TAP are lax as clearly their planes are not checked properly before passengers board.

### "mind of TAP staff is I don’t care"
Zurich to Fortaleza via Lisbon. The first leg ZRH-LIS was operated by SWISS. As I was unable to check-in online (nor on TAP website neither on SWISS – “your booking reference could not be found, please go to the check-in at the airport”), I had already a bad premonition concerning this trip. Arrived at ZRH I tried the check-in machine – same result. I had to go to the check-in helpdesk counter. After 20 minutes queuing, the lady told me: “Your ticket is in the system but not cleared by TAP for check-in” and involved the supervisor. I have to say, the SWISS staff was very attentive trying to solve the problem, the supervisor was calling simultaneously on 3 lines. Only TAP was not reachable. 30 min before departure he managed to “enable” my ticket and I ended up running to the gate to catch my flight and praying my luggage would make it too. Arrived at LIS I had to notice that my flight LIS-FOR was delayed from 16:35 SDT to 19:10. At the gate no explanations for the reason, no excuses, no information, that the flight will be operated by a 20 years old Hi Fly Malta A340. After some postpones without any explanation we took off with a delay of more than 5 hours. There was a huge confusion at the gate and in the plane because the most of the fellow travelers have been re-seated. In the plane was no entertainment available, not even music. And as I asked for the second beer, it was refused – “the alcohol consumption on board is limited”. We arrived at 03:00 AM in FOR, the immigration procedure took 1,5 hours with only 2 counters open. I’ve been flying TAP already for more than 20 years and have the impression, the service and the staff mind is getting worse and worse. TAP is in fact a monopolist on the routes to the secondary hubs in Brazil like FOR, REC, SSA and exploits the situation neglecting the service. My flight was not a cheap one: 1200 EUR. It seems the general mind of TAP staff is “I don’t care”. So I am very lucky KLM and Air France are going to start as from April 2018 new connections from Amsterdam and Paris to north-east of Brazil.

### "made me pay to take a 23kg luggage"
I bought a flight ticket at TAP Portugal from London to Maputo, having a long time stop connection flight around 12hrs in Lisbon, in which it was ok for me. I paid £575. However, I had no luggage allowance, anything, and they made me pay around £70 to take a 23kg luggage, this is something I have never seen before and I think it’s an absurd and disrespect with customers, how the company expects someone to travel a long distance, over than 10 hours without luggage, plus when you go to buy the flight ticket it doesn’t show clearly that a customer has to buy allowances to get a luggage.

### "Terrible policies and customer service"
I was traveling alone on a long overnight flight from New York to Lisbon (after a 12hr layover) and so prepaid an additional $30 to preselect a window seat so I would be more comfortable. However, when I got on the plane, my assigned seat was a middle seat. I reported the issue and requested a $30 refund via their website soon after the flight. 2.5 months later I received the following response: "According to our records you pre-selected and paid for seats 26J and received upon check in and on board 26F. As the seats you were assigned share the same characteristics and value as the seats you had pre-selected and paid for no refund is due. This is bogus. The seats do not have the same characteristics. For most people, the most important characteristic is whether the seat is aisle, window, or middle. Basically, they stole from me. Terrible policies and customer service.

### "flight crew are not very welcoming"
Flew TAP Portugal from Lisbon to London Heathrow. Firstly this airline has no vegetarian options. The ground staff and flight crew are not very welcoming and it is as if they are reluctantly taking us on their aircraft free of charge. The airline managed to damage our bag and we claimed a replacement. The number on the form was for Lisbon however it stated (UK national number). Be careful of this airline. Try to avoid.

### "service on board was good again"
The flight from Berlin was delayed by an hour or so although it was the first morning flight, and the aircraft had been there all night. The breakfast offered in business class was very tasty but a bit undersized, but it was served with a smile. The big disappointment came at Lison Airport. The newly opened TAP Exercutive Lounge is closed from 7 to 23 December. These things can of course happen, but that TAP was unable or unwilling to make arrangements with ANA, the operator of the airport lounge, at its hub in Lisbon to provide for their premium customers is a disgrace. The people at the TAP transfer desk themselves were very doubtful whether TAP would refund the money we would have to pay to enter the ANA Airport Lounge. Luckily, because of the delay of the previous flight, boarding for the flight to Las Palmas began soon, and we could survive without lounge visit. The flight departed right on time. The service on the flight to Las Palmas was good. The return flight started with a 75-minute delay which, eventually, became a 150-minute delay as the aircraft needed a new slot at Las Palmas. The service on board was good again. The delay, however, meant that the original three-hour transit time became a 40-minute transit time in Lisbon. Luckily, we were picked up by ground crew and brought straight to our departure gate in a limousine. The flight to Berlin took off punctually again and even landed in Berlin approx. 40 minutes ahead of the regular arrival time. The service and crew were great again.

### "they lost my luggage"
Stuttgart to Miami via Lisbon. I am so disappointed. It is my first time to fly TAP Portugal they lost my luggage they can’t find it. I am so mad. My first time and I am pretty sure my last flight with this company tap Portugal.

### "ridiculous cabin luggage requirements"
Lisbon to Vienna. Bad boarding service with ridiculous cabin luggage requirements. Forced 90% of the traveller to put their standard sized trolley in the cargo hall. To avoid for business travellers. The cabin in the plane was far too cold but the on board service was fair.

### "TAP make life as difficult as possible"
I travel regularly out of Lisbon generally in business class where available. Even happy to use budget airlines! This is the first time I have flown TAP, sadly I have to return to Lisbon on TAP, if I could transfer to Lufthansa I would. Ryanair, Transavia or EasyJet would have been a better option and value! My complaint to TAP - Today December 4th I have boarded TP552, LIS-MUC. Despite sending them all the details regarding my mobility scooter in advance and having several conversations regarding it I find myself with problems at Lisbon airport. It appears that TAP make life as difficult as possible for a disabled passenger causing unnecessary stress. With all other airlines I can travel with independence taking my scooter to the gate with me. As a regular traveller using many different airlines on a regular basis, including budget airlines, out of Lisbon I have always been able to use my mobility scooter through security, passport control and direct to the business lounge then on to the gate. It is no bigger than a baby buggy and folds flat just like a buggy! Today I had to wait almost 15 mins at check in for a MYWAY wheelchair to be brought. Then go with him to the out of gauge baggage riding my scooter to drop it off. I am then taken to the executive lounge without a chance to stop at any of the shops. On board I am approached by the dispatcher saying my battery needs to be removed from my scooter and I need to carry it with me! As the battery is key operated (the key removed and carried on my person) and secured in the scooter by a lock this is not necessary (ref IATA regulations 965-II /966/967) I carry the iata regulations with me and the certification that the battery is safe for travel at all times. The dispatcher goes away and eventually returns saying that this will no longer be necessary. Being told that this is a new procedure with the airline does not leave me with a lot of confidence as it is just an excuse for being uninformed. Seat - no different from economy. Uncomfortable - does not recline, only difference is the middle seat is left free. Food - who on earth serves roast beef for breakfast with a 07.55 departure? All this and at a premium price.

### "poor customer service"
New York to London via Lisbon. I fly between UK and US many times this year, with many different airlines such as American Airline, British Airline, Norwegian and the last flight was TAP Portugal. Really regretted choosing it and definitely will not recommend it for the following reasons. Watch out for allure price. I booked this through Chase Credit Card Reward website, the time/price seeems very good. Though very soon I found out it will charge money for even first piece of checked in luggage. Come on, international flight, who will charge that? Most company has first one free. Fine, I booked it and accepted this fact but very soon more angry problem occurs. It shows on their website if checked in online, the checked in luggage fee is $75. So I called them few days before the flight to put in the luggage request. The TAP customer service person took almost an hour to get this done due to system crash but assure me at the end this is put in. When I have my credit card ready for payment, the rep says I can pay at the airport during check in. I asked if there's any reference for this, the rep told me it's been put into my ticket number. Yet when I got to the airport, the checked in staff just told me I have to pay $90 because I did not pay in advance. I explained to them and ask them to check if any note put into the ticket in the system. They pretty much don't care and just told me they couldn't do anything about it. Since I have to go, did not bother to argue with them. After I landed on UK, I first called their customer service in Spain. The agent acknowledged they did see I call in prior to the check in, but refused to do any refund. The agent said their coworker may have mis-interpret the paid-in-advance term. Come on, your problem and I have to take the loss? She then told me I can fill up online complaint form. I did that on Nov 22th, receive an auto response email saying the complaint is received, then no update at all. Very poor customer service and system handling, and don't seem to care about reputation. During check in, if you want to change seat, any other seat will incur payment whereas most airline there's usually few seats one can interchange without additional fee. Once onboard, their service is fine but the ground service and customer service really annoys me. Won't consider this company again.

### "desperately trying to call the customer service"
I do not recommend anyone flying with TAP Portugal. It is the worse company ever! Our flight to Lisbon was cancelled without any prior notice and on our return the flight was overbooked and my husband and I had no places to get in. So really, what are the chances in a million to book only 2 flights in your lifetime with TAP, and both to be affected by incompetence! I have filed a complaint online on 10 November 2017 for the cancelled flight for both of us and no news from TAP since. I have been desperately trying to call the customer service for several days, several times a day, each time waiting on the line for more than 30 minutes, with no success. Of course, all of this on my expense and on my own time! I have a life and I have a job, so why should I put so much time into this, instead of TAP fixing its customer service problems and organisation? I truly advise anyone to better book any other airline (even low costs) than TAP!

### "2 hours and 30 minutes delay"
Lisbon to Milan. I never like to write bad comments but this time I will. We arrived to the airport and went to our gate. After the boarding time arrived they told us the flight had 30 minutes delay. When 45 minutes from departure were passed they told us to change gate and to wait there, no explanation was given. The flight took off with 2 hours and 30 minutes delay. No excuses were given by cabin staff. Awful experience.

### "ground service very unorganized"
Porto to Zurich. Ground service very unorganized, passengers don't queue and are not organized by airport officers. Staff treat passengers with hostility. I travelled hundreds of times because of my job and I can say that 90% percent of these times, I was treated like they are doing a favor to take care of what they are paid to do. Really rude and kind of arrogant that I can't recall to witness in the very best airline companies I have travelled with.

### "Definitely using TAP again"
Flew TAP on the routes Funchal to Lisbon, then Lisbon to Frankfurt. Both flights were on time, and landed in both destinations 5-10 mins. before schedule. Check-in in FNC was easy and polite. Business lounge in FNC a little small (and difficult to find), but did the job. FNC to LIS (1 hour 40 mins. ): Hot meal, salad and desert served along with free drinks. LIS to FRA (2 hours 40 mins.) Choice of two hot meals with salad, desert, and chocolate served along with free drinks. Cabin staff didn't look totally motivated, but they delivered professional courtesy and service all the way. Only thing that was a little confusing was that the online check-in didn't indicate that the middle seat in business class is actually free - so when you check in online it is easy to reserve a wrong seat. Altogether really well done. Definitely using TAP again.

### "TAP staff were very unhelpful"
Flew TAP Portugal from Lisbon to London City. Lisbon airport has horribly long exit immigration queues and the officials don't seem to apply any sense. In spite of coming 1.5 hours before my flight I missed it and TAP staff were very unhelpful. They have no customer service desks after immigration and expect you to stand in long lines to go back out and then stand in another long queue and come back in which by today's experience would have taken at least 2 hours. TAP ground staff and officials are rude and bordering on stupid. They are a bad name for a great country. I'm not coming back here on an international flight. If I have to I will come via another port within Schengen.

### "Consider yourself warned!"
I recently booked an intercontinental TAP flight from Germany to the U.S. through my credit card company. I’ve never been on a flight that doesn’t include checked luggage on inter-continental flights before until I was checking my bag and was slammed with an excessive 75 euro checked baggage fee at the counter. This is one of the highest checked bag fees in the airline industries and have finally uncovered why I was charged this in the first place, so that you can avoid tap at all costs. Even the airport employee was surprised by this new scheme that he had to call TAP to confirm I was actually being charged this for one checked bag across the Atlantic. There is a new ‘Discounted Ticket’ price was just launched a few months ago by TAP to get more money out of their customers. If you are booking your ticket with any 3rd party you will never know that you are getting this ‘Discounted Ticket’ type since 3rd parties leave it on you to find out the baggage policies. I’ve also learned that TAP hides the ticket type from you online, the only way to find out what type of ticket you have is my waiting on the phone for long wait times and asking on of their representatives. I feel scammed out of my money and am very surprised TAP thinks that this is an intelligent business model, as I’m guess they receive many calls a day about this issue. This is warning to all people looking to travel with TAP and don’t want to be duped into surprise fees when checking-in. Delta, American, Virgin, and other reputable airlines are very clear in their pricing, TAP is not! Go buy tickets from them instead or you may end up paying confusing excessive baggage fees with some of the highest fees in the airline industry! I’ve contacted many friends who have recommended TAP to me that fly TAP regularly and warned them of their new deceptive business practices. Consider yourself warned!

### TAP Portugal customer review
Lisbon to Warsaw. Flying business for the first time. At the airport, I was not informed about the proper check-in (despite showing my boarding pass to staff), which made me take a little longer. Staff were attentive, food was great. Plenty of room. I just think that sometimes, some staff should make the announcements a little slower - especially when not in their native language - so that they are clear.

### "the crew was extremely nice"
Flew Warsaw to Lisbon with TAP Portugal. Efficient, although at check in no one was ensuring Business passengers were waiting to be checked in. On the aircraft, the crew was extremely nice. Not only to business passengers, but to everyone coming on board, which is great to see. The service is good, the food being very good indeed. I would just suggest that the crew would check on the passengers after the meals are gone, just to check if anything is needed.

### "the impossibly tardy service"
Lisbon to Casablanca. I'd booked an early morning flight so that I'd have more time in Casablanca before heading to chefchouen the next day. However, TAP   delayed the flight by 4 hours without giving a good reason. No option to cancel the flight was offered. Then when I arrived at the airport, it was delayed again by 40 minutes, saying the flight will be at 14:00. The time now is 13:55 but I haven't even gotten on board. Thanks TAP Portugal, for wasting our precious time and for the impossibly tardy service.

### "never purchase TAP Portugal"
I had connecting flight from New York to Prague through Lisbon. Both flights were provided by Tap Portugal. They cancelled first flight in few hours before the flight. Their representative provided me wrong information assuring me that I"ll have the second flight from Lisbon with few hours delay and I will be in Prague just few hours later. But the problem was that the second flight didn't exist at all. And I had to wait extra 24 hours in the airport for the next flight. As a result I was late for 36 hours and it was terrible 36 hours. There was an opportunity to switch the company to Czech Airline in case I"ll pay for new ticket. But Tap Portugal lost my baggage so it didn't work. Now they don't want to do the refund for the cancelled flight! Could you imagine it? I had flight from many different air companies and there were no problems with them so I have never check reviews before this situation and it was my mistake. People, you should never purchase TAP Portugal!

### "planes offers very little space"
London to Abidjan via Lisbon. Stay away, first of all the low budget offer is a trick as it does not include the usual luggage allowance. They will cancel your flight without suggesting you any alternative and make you flight on anyway they want base on their flight availability. The luggage allowance is a joke, you will end up spending loads on luggage and extras which will end up in a ticket fare being considerably high. The planes offers very little space and no comfort with long distance flight without screens or entertainment. They are really disorganised and will make last minute changes to your tickets with no correct updates. Also, once at the airport be prepared to wait at least an hour to register your luggage before finding out that you went over the allowance. Surprise to see such company still carrying passengers despite their lack of professionalism.

### "don't waste your money on TAP"
I booked my flight with TAP for November the 4th, unfortunately after a month TAP cancelled my flight without consultation and they had push my reservation through different flight and different day which didn't work for me. When I called them they were not helpful at all, customer service is really bad, and when I asked for refund it took them 6 weeks to give me my money back and that's after many calls I made. This is the first and last time with them. Spend more money on a flight with Lufthansa or Swiss and don't waste your money on TAP.

### "the worst I have ever traveled with"
Based on my recent experience with TAP Portugal I must rate this airline as the worst I have ever traveled with. I traveled to Funchal via Frankfurt and Lisbon and the 4 flights in and out of Lisbon were handled by TAP. All 4 flights were delayed and on all flights they came up with some excuse for not providing a meal service. The worst flight was the return flight from Lisbon to Frankfurt. There was a lot of confusion about departure time but eventually it departed more than 2 hours late. We were given a mediocre meal box as we entered but during the 3 hour flight TAP only served a single glass of water. There were many flight attendants but basically they did not do much else than talk to each other during the whole flight. During the flight I noticed that the flight attendants were busy sorting the content of remaining meal boxes at the back of the cabin with their backs turned to the passengers. Why they would spend time on that rather than serving the passengers is beyond me. The information from the pilot on the PA system was unintelligible due to lots of noise and distortion. The last flight of our trip was handled by Lufthansa. What a difference. During this short 75 minute flight they managed to serve a nice sandwich and serve drinks twice and they passed through the cabin several times to collect garbage all done with a friendly smile.

### "outdated wide body machine"
Warsaw to Lisbon. The Boeing 767-300 economy class with 2-4-2 layout, all the chairs cannot be adjusted before and after, and the seat is very thin, very hard and very uncomfortable. Economy seats equipped with a 10.3-inch entertainment screen, screen clarity is very good, but the screen touch screen response speed is very insensitive, people are very angry. Overall, the service on the plane is good, especially the food, very delicious. The service of the flight attendants is pretty good, but compared to this outdated wide body machine, I prefer to take the ordinary narrow body aircraft. Because in the economy class of this aircraft, flying nearly 5 hours is simply a kind of suffering.

### "no emphasis on people"
If you’re going anywhere in Europe, you’re better off hitching a ride in a van. If going overseas, stowing in a crate on a cargo ship. I have never experienced an airline as terrible as TAP, it would be laughable if the situation weren’t horrible. If you could get a worker to actually speak with you long enough rather than shooing you away chances are they will genuinely try to help which is probably it’s only redeeming factor, but it’s clear that company wide there is no emphasis on the people it flies, or ever getting them where they paid to be. Travel woes happen, but TAP creates them where none existed. I can assure myself as well as probably 1000 other people who had the unfortunate displeasure of transferring through Lisbon yesterday won’t be flying them ever again.

### "the worst airline in the world"
Lisbon to London. This must be the worst airline in the world. There was fog in Lisbon this morning causing some disruption but this was not enough to excuse the really terrible customer service. Absolutely no information in Oporto, then two crew members missing (! ), take off five hours late, waited ages for buses in Lisbon to take us to the terminal, missed a suitable connection by minutes which was unnecessary, bussed to an hotel 30 miles outside Lisbon for the night, beds made of planks, etc etc. Never again! I've given one star in the various categories only because it is impossible to give zero.

### "the worst airline hands down"
Sao Vicente to London via Lisbon. Absolutely the worst airline hands down. Stranded us for 21 hours with no accommodation. Lost my luggage and didn't care. No response to emails and Every phone call leads to the wrong department. They were late flying back and again gave us no communication or apology. This is the worst service I have ever experienced with an airline and I will never set foot aboard a TAP plane again. Failed to provide the special meals booked and had taken an extra €100 pp for luggage they lost.

### "avoid TAP like the plague"
Newark to Toulouse via Lisbon. I fly a lot (United 1K, flying mostly on Lufthansa, United and KLM). None of these airlines is perfect, but TAP seem way more disorganized than any of the other airlines I usually fly. Today my flight (TP202, Oct 18 2017) is delayed 8 hours! They apparently sent a warning email to a wrong address (they have my email address, they emailed me boarding passes for this flight). Yesterday, I wanted information about luggage allowance for Star Alliance Gold members, and information about shipping a bike. Long story short, I had to call 3 times, the 3 people I talked to gave me 3 different stories (do their call center employees get any type of training? ), they claim they weren't able to charge my card for the bike fee, but then send me a confirmation email anyway. Note also that for every call I placed I had to wait for 15 to 35 minutes before talking to a human. 2 of the 3 people I talked to promised to follow up with an email and noone did. Finally, TAP weren't able to rebook me on an alternate flight, so I am going to arrive ~8 hours later than planned. They offered no compensation either. I will avoid TAP like the plague.

### "cabin crew were polite"
Lisbon to Luxembourg. Self check-in machines at Lisbon airport and I did not have to wait for longer time to drop-off the bag. I appreciate that all check-in counters or bag drop-off counters were open and the friendliness of check-in staff. The flight to Luxembourg was with A319R. The plane was clean and I sat on the economy class 4A with plenty of space. I can find the USB slot or electricity slot. As an economy passenger, I was entitled to carry one cabin bag and one laptop case. The cabin crew were polite, friendly and had good attitude towards the passengers. The qualities of the services match what I have paid. I recommend to fly with TAP Portugal.

### "awesome flight attendants"
Madrid to Miami via Lisbon. The flight attendants on our flight were beyond amazing. Very personable and professional, and made a long flight easy to bear. We will most definitely be using this airline in the future due to the amazing prices, cleanliness, food, entertainment, and awesome flight attendants!

### "business class product does not do it"
Flew Berlin to Lisbon. I was not that optimistic about TAP having read so many bad reviews. But I decided to go with an open mind. Well, TAP is really disappointing in my view. The business class product does not do it. The breakfast looked ok, no problem. The problem I had was that once they had served breakfast, the staff congregated in the galley for the rest of the flight. This is a 3hr plus flight. It would not hurt to ask if (at least) any of the premium class passengers would like something else to drink for instance. Shame on you TAP.

### "employees were rude"
Flew TAP from Lisbon to London Heathrow. Worst service I've ever experienced! First the flight was overbooked, then they offer money (a credit card) and a new flight for the next day (latter than the time on my original flight). The credit card with the money compensation didn't work: one and a half hours at the desk again to finally get my money. The next day the new flight was late. Not only late: they made us wait for twenty minutes on a bus that would bring us to the airplane. All ten employees were rude and poorly prepared!

### "top and flop"
Top and flop. From Zurich to Lisbon a very impressive service with champagne and great food. On return flight no service at all. Crew only chatting each other. They told us that a crew member was missing so they couldnt do any service!

### "Good flight and good captain"
TAP Munich to Lisbon, A320. Delay as usual. The last 10 flights that I have done with from TAP (if I am not mistaken) have been delayed, this one by almost one hour. How is it possible to have so many flights always delayed? The plane was a reconfigured one, seats were new, not that soft but modern. USB connection and Power to the devices is available, very good positive change with this upgrade on this type of plane. Crew were kind and they served the passengers well, young crew but attentive, some kind, others not so much. I was in an emergency seat with 2 empty places near me, TAP not only allows us to sit (Vitoria passengers) in these seats for free, but I am noticing more and more they don’t use the seats nearby if the flight is not full to give us more space. Well done TAP, almost like Lufthansa. This is a good improvement for the frequent flyer. Lights didn’t work (the extra lights on the 12 – A-B-C so no reading. Good flight and good captain.

### "Horrible airline"
Amsterdam to New York via Lisbon. Worst airline I have ever flown! Onboard is fine. People are kind. The airline is disorganized and doesn't care about the customers. If you don't buy directly from their site you have to pay for checked luggage on an international flight! So beware. I booked on Priceline and it said that my luggage was included. When I got to the ticket counter it said I had a discount ticket (even though it was the same price as a normal ticket) and got charged extra for baggage. In order to pay for the bags I was not allowed to pay online and was told to go to the counter. When I got there I was redirected after waiting in line for forty minutes! I had to navigate to another counter not nearby and pay! Then the flight got delayed and they had no solution for getting me a connecting flight in order to get to NYC in time to work! Horrible airline.

### "think twice about booking with TAP"
Toronto to Stuttgart via Lisbon. I suggest that people think twice about booking with TAP. My credit card was charged for a change of flight reservation and they somehow "lost my payment' and withdrew my ticket. I was instructed to provide my credit card statements proving that my credit card was debited, which I did. They still insisted that they weren't able to find my payment and I had to pay an additional $360CAD. After that, I still paid because I needed to get into Freiburg for school. When I got to the airport the desk personnel at TAP told me that the gate was changing that I needed to head in a completely different direction than what's on the ticket. I didn't think that someone at the airport would mislead me, but she did. I ended up missing my flight because i was in the wrong area and I wasn't allowed to cross over without exiting and going through security all over again. After calling TAP trying to get my some sort of resolution I was told that I would have to pay for a brand new flight because they have "no idea" what went on in Toronto and I've lost all the money associated to the flight that I missed. I'm not sure how to feel right now, I've never been so disrespected as a customer before in my life. I will never, ever book with TAP no matter how much money I'll be saving. I'm not so much angry just very hurt and displeased.

### "less than 50% of fleet renovated"
Marseille to Rio de Janeiro via Lisbon. Excellent staff at MRS and LIS. Smooth check-in, clean aircraft, nice Portuguese meals. E190 is a strong progress on European destinations (vs F100). However TAP insists in using 16 years old A300-200 with nearly no IFE and no flat-beds, while it advertises full-flat with nice IFE. It is not acceptable as far as less than 50% of the fleet has been renovated.

### "advise against flying with TAP"
Paris to Lisbon. On the return business flight from Paris, no lunch or hot beverages were served, only a box with a sandwich and small drink, left in our seats when we boarded (a flight attendant did hand out a 50 euro coupon to some for a new booking in compensation but since TAP has had issues applying the coupon, entailing much wasted time). The weather was perfect but the captain made a terrifying landing, food boxes from around the plane slid down the aisle and landed in front of the cabin door as did objects such as one passenger's book etc. The flight attendants looked visibly shocked. In consequence certain baggage was damaged (including an item within my stored luggage) and there was an issue with bag delivery. No apology was made for the very bizarre landing. Complaints I made on the website or in answer to their personal surveys have not been responded to and if I attempt to make them by phone or at the Lisbon airport, the representatives reply that I must make them on the website. I have asked several times on the phone to be passed to a manager or supervisor to resolve this but my requests have all been refused, the representatives claim they have a policy not to speak to customers. My bookings on the website regularly go wrong including for the above flithg and requiring on average up to two hours to sort out by phone. The last representative I spoke to on 4 October 2017 in relation to a new online booking issue and the above coupon issue and the above flight, again refused to pass me to a supervisor despite several requests to do so and the fact that I emphasised to her that I was recording the call. After 53 minutes of phone call my new booking issue was not fully resolved and I was told I would have to wait another 48 hours to know if my most recent flight reservation had gone through or not. I recently joined Victoria miles thinking that customer service might improve but this has made no difference. I advise against flying with TAP whenever another option is available for you until a time when TAP addresses its customer service and safety issues.

### "no explanation"
Amsterdam to Porto. Departure time 3:30 on 3rd October got delayed for 3 hours. Nobody apologize, no explanation announcement, keep changing monitor time! Seems this airline doesn’t care customer time at all! Funny thing is airport information desk said flight is not departed from Porto yet to take Amsterdam passenger, but on the screen of airport showing this flight depart after one hour. Very poor management.

### "seat does not go flat"
Miami to Lisbon on old plane, food not that good to be honest, didn’t look that fresh. But TAP have a great soup, so the Soup is the secret weapon if the food is not that great. A good crew, they smile the Crew Chef comes and say hello. Old seats, old screens nothing help to be honest, the seat does not go flat, and so your position to sleep will not be the best. Plain was clean, and I notice something we have space for the bags.

### "the staff were so angry and unhelpful"
We checked in online as usual and were not informed until we arrived at the airport (at 4.30 am!) that the flight was cancelled. They could have contacted us a lot earlier, as they had no crew for the plane. Apparently this happens a lot as they are like Ryanair and try to cut costs on crew. I was travelling with a young child. The airline staff sent all the passengers on the flight, to different queues in the Airport, for the best part of 4 hours, snaking round the airport. Firstly the Customer service queue: not their problem, then to a check in desk: not their problem, then another desk, where they just told us to go away, they couldn't help us until later in the day. They didn't rebook our flights and told us to come back at 11 am with the possibility of a flight the next day (after waiting for 4 hours in these queues). In addition, the Head of Customer services was angry and shouted at all the UK travellers in a most unpleasant way. Finally, after pushing them to do something, we were rebooked on a ridiculous Lufthansa flight via Frankfurt to London, where we couldn't make the 15 minute connection, changing terminals at Frankfurt and missed it! The Lufthansa staff were actually lovely and helpful, and said we shouldn't have been rebooked onto that flight, as the gap between them was less than 40 minutes. My husband ended up driving from Manchester to London (9 hour round trip) to pick us up. Just to add insult to injury, they don't respond to requests for EU compensation so they force their customers to go through the Aviation ADR in order to claim any compensation one is entitled to, AKA Ryanair. Personally, I will avoid flying with them again, especially as the staff were so angry and unhelpful, plus the complete lack of interest in any aftercare.

### "airline is known for delays"
I was flying from Budapest to Lisbon and after arriving to the airport I discovered the flight was cancelled without any prior notification, no representative from the airline to explain anything and after waiting at the airport for an hour they informed us it is rescheduled to fly after 12 hours! This airline is known for delays. Do not ever use them! the worst customer service experience ever!

### "unprofessional and clumsy"
Brussels to Lisbon. Such an unprofessional and clumsy service. Boarding takes ages with TAP, due to the unorganised way to deal with the hand luggage. This flight was not an exemption and people were walking back and forth with no spaces for luggage. The departure was delayed by more than 1hr, with passengers already sitting in the plane. The communication of the captain was poor and careless, no apology. When flying, we learn that this flight does not provide food service, as we had less crew than we should have, surreal! Again, no communication from the captain. The poor stewardesses were explaining the situation row by row.

### "seat allows you to sleep"
Lisbon to Miami in Business. Delay 2 Hours, lost my connection - I assume that is just bad luck but I can’t get a TAP plane on time. The plane is not new but in good condition, old screens and same different functions. The chair almost goes flat, so we can sleep well vs the majority of the TAP planes. The crew was good, efficient smiling good people good service on this flight. The food was decent, good to be honest at least what I did eat (cod fish) only 2 red wines but they are decent. Space for the bags,  this one as space for the luggage, we don’t need to fight in business to find a place for the luggage. A good flight, entertainment didn’t work that well and no WI-FI on board, but the most important feature is the seat allows you to sleep.

### "no seats for our tickets"
Lisbon to Bucharest. We bought our tickets from February, at a price that suggest us it isnt a low cost airline. We made the check-in 36 hours before, but when we were near to our presumed seats, we found that there are no seats for our tickets, so we took first available seats. Food and bewerage was something not to mention (100 ml of water). If you have any other choice, don't use TAP.

### "We will never travel with TAP again"
Our flight from Lisbon to Madrid was just as bad as our previous one from Heathrow to Lisbon. I searched in vain on their website to request assistance for my husband who has arthritis in his knees and foot. There was nowhere at the airport where this request could be made. On discovering at the boarding gate that we were to be bused to the far reaches of the airport and would be using boarding stairs I asked for help. This was refused as we were told that we should have asked for assistance when we booked. As we booked through a travel agent 6 months before and had assumed an air bridge this had not been an issue. When I explained this to a ground staff member she walked away. We were then herded onto buses and left to wait on a crowded bus in the 31 degree heat for a considerable time before even travelling to the aircraft. My husband was left to try to drag himself up the stairs while I struggled with our carry on bags. We were blessed by a member of the onboard team who took pity on us and helped us. As it was, I jarred my leg trying to negotiate the large step onto the plane with our bags and am now nursing a very sore leg. We will never travel with TAP again.

### "we could have no assistance"
London Heathrow to Lisbon. Plane late leaving Heathrow, but captain explained. No complaints about that. When plane arrived at a remote spot at Lisbon Airport, stairs were wheeled up to the plane. There was a considerable step from the plane to the stairs. I asked for assistance for my husband who has arthritis in both knees and a foot. A stewardess told us, me having climbed back on plane up steep step, jarring a sore hip in the process, to go to front of plane where my husband could get assistance. Then one of her colleagues told us that we could have no assistance as we had not requested it when we booked in. I told her that in the absence of any notification to the contrary, flying from the capital city of one country to the capital of another, we would assume an airbridge. To be fair, staff did then assist my husband down the stairs. We are dreading our flight out of Lisbon to Madrid in 36 hours time as we do not wish to go through such a process again.

### "not even an I'm sorry"
London to Faro via Lisbon. The flight was delayed 4 hours, that made me lose my connection. Instead of the airline paying a hotel for the night they choose to put me in the premium lounge which was full with lots of people sleeping, even in the floor. At 4:30 am they decide to kick all the people from the lounge because it was going to open and other people who pay where going to use it. The staff was making fun of the reactions of the people. It was not our fault our plane got delayed and we all lost our connection and then we had sleep on the floor. What they should give us is our money back or something if they are going to treat us like that. The food was bad but the staff on the plane was ok. I travel a lot and I understand problems happens but this is the 3rd time I lose a connection because a delayed flight. With United airlines and British airways the treatment was perfect. Here in TAP, not even an "I'm sorry".

### "not have onboard service"
Lisbon to Zurich, Sunday in the morning waiting for the boarding. Announcement saying that the flight will not have onboard service. 25 minutes delay. Here we are a TAP Flight; A319, chairs are modern, not that soft but they work. Service on board don’t match the announcement, no food no service, why they are warming up the food? And passing with their personal trays in front of usI don’t see any purpose on that you are a bunch of hours in a plane if there is no food, no service and they are eating (they the crew) near you (on the other side of the curtain) you can smell the food and so on … Is not a pleasant situation, TAP does this a lot, at least to me 4 or 5 times a year, they just announce a few minutes before the flight that service on-board is not available and … good luck. To be honest all this years I really never understand this TAP protocol with the service a small plane with 4 Crew people why they don’t serve the food on board. But again not all is that bad (for the first time in all this years) they are delivering a voucher, some honesty in the end of the road? A Voucher with a code for 50 Euros; well is not value is the gesture (thank you TAP) The business is the usual Business low cost TAP, no Journals, no Magazines, no Wi-Fi, just chair and in this case no service at all.

### "worst airline I have encountered"
Oslo to Lisbon. TAP is the worst airline I have ever encountered with regards to customer service. They significantly changed the departure times for both flights without notifying us. We discovered this at check in, 22 hours before the flight, and this resulted in one of the travellers having to rebook a connecting flight. TAP customer service confirmed that we had not been notified when I called them. We made a written complaint to customer service as soon as the trip was over, and waited 13 weeks before we were asked to provide more information. I have now waited another 4 weeks, and still no answer. This is unacceptable in terms of customer service.

### "cancelled with no notification"
Prague to Lisbon. TAP cancelled our 6:45am 4 September flight TP1307 from Prague to Lisbon overnight with no notification, meaning most passengers arrived at the airport around 5am and then had to spend another hour and a half rescheduling their flight which TAP put on 12 hours later. Some folk had checked out of hotels and had to spend 12 hours at the airport. The replacement flight which left Prague at 7pm was ok, but instead of a meal the only thing offered was a glass of water. No apologies, no notifications, no explanations, third world service from a Star Alliance member. The amount of disruption and extra expense to travellers including ourselves was enormous.

### "never travel with this company again"
Toronto to Barcelona via Lisbon. Staff in Toronto rude and dismissive, when asked about delays was told “just a few minutes”, in fact there was a one hour delay (which I had seen on the screen before checking-in), which meant a 1:00 am departure. Boarding chaotic, despite going by zones. Cabin quite attractive but hot upon boarding, it cooled down once in the air. Seat on the A330 hard but roomy enough, with a tiny screen in front, and a useless foot rest (for tall people) which leaves the under-seat space inaccessible. Incredibly, instead of serving us breakfast before landing, dinner was served in the middle of the night. I opted to sleep for the entire journey, so declined. Only coffee was served in the morning. Lisbon to Barcelona flight on an A320, much less roomy, also late by half-an-hour, and just before boarding a barely audible announcement was made that due to a staff shortage there would be no service on board. This was never mentioned again, neither at the beginning nor the end of the flight, no apology, nothing, and not so much as a glass of water (even in Business class), even though my ticket stated dinner would be served. No accountability and worse than a low-cost airline. At least they smiled. To top it off, no luggage in Barcelona. Lined up at Swissport to file a report. It was eventually located and delivered to my home 48 hours later damaged. The flight was cheap and they seem to be trying but I will never travel with this company again if I can avoid them and I strongly recommend you consider other options.

### TAP Portugal customer review
I used TAP Portugal for a trip from Vienna to Portugal's mainland and the Azores. The flights between VIE and LIS were operated by TAP. Overall, my family and me were very satisfied. VIE-LIS was an A320 and everything went smoothly. For the return flight we were very positively surprised that even though the airport in LIS was very crowded due to the fact that it was highest season and we had oversized luggage, check-in and boarding went very quick and efficient. The plane was a seemingly modern A330. All flights were on time, staff, both on board as well as ground, were very friendly and - important for tall people like me - legroom was sufficient. Just one small criticism: on the flight back to VIE it was only after departure that they announced to be flying with minimum staff and therefore reduced service. Nevertheless, a sandwich an juice were distributed before departure and you could get yourself water during the flight, which was absolutely sufficient given the duration and the time of the flight.

### "low economy class standard"
Hamburg to Accra via Lisbon. The business class is low economy class standard. My knees touched the next seat, not much option to recline the seat. There was no inflight entertainmaint and no socket to plug in a laptop. Food was okay, the rest was worse than what you get on most economy flights.

### "avoid TAP at all costs"
I flew with TAP from Lisbon to Zurich from where I had connecting flight to Helsinki. When I arrived at the airport the flight had a 20 minute delay. After 30 minutes or so, the gate finally opened and we took the shuttle bus to the plane. Upon arrival, it became evident that the plane still was not ready as the shuttle driver left the bus and left everyone stuck inside standing on a hot day for over 10 minutes. After that we were finally able to board, but the plane only took off about 40 minutes later. During this time I attempted to ask both the cabin staff and the captain on how long it would take to depart and none were able to give me an answer. The flight eventually departed roughly 1h30 late, which caused me to miss all the connection flights. While in Zurich I contacted the ground staff, who were unable to provide an alternative flight which would allow me to arrive in time for my presentation. I ended sleeping in Zurich and returning to Portugal the day after. Back in Portugal, I waited in line to get the €400 compensation at the company customer support counter, but I was dismissed by the staff who didn't care for my situation and just gave me an email address. Still waiting on resolution on this situation. Onboard quality is also terrible. The food is just a sandwich and a sample-sized yogurt. On the stretch back home I was thirsty as there were no drinks available. The airplane was dirty. There are no in-flight entertainment options. I have flown low-cost flights before and  even those have much higher quality than TAP, at a fraction of the cost. It is a miracle that this company can continue to operate in these conditions. I urge fellow travels to avoid TAP at all costs.

### "worst airline I have taken"
London to Abidjan via Lisbon. TAP Portugal is the worst airline I have taken. For both my flights TAP did not leave on time. We were delayed for an hour and 15 minutes to my destination and nearly an hours delay on my way back. What did this mean for my transfer flight? Delayed baggage. When you are travelling for business purposes, meant to be presenting the next day and have no luggage with you, it does not bode well. To make matters worse, the bag was not delivered to me, I had to go and pick it up at the local airport at 10pm, 2 days after. This is after spending 3 hours (9:45pm-12:45am), trying to sort out where my bag had ended up, because the ticket attendant who checked in my bag did not put the baggage number on my ticket. Cue in running around a foreign airport, trying to find TAP staff who were still working past 11 at night, in order to obtain the baggage number and then take that to the delayed / lost baggage office. I therefore knew, with the return flight being an hour late, that I would have the same problem. After waiting 25 minutes by the baggage carousel, I filed a delayed/lost baggage claim. The man at the GBS counter tried to tell me that there were no messages on his system and therefore I should wait it out. I politely but firmly had to tell the guy that this same thing had occurred before and I am not prepared to wait 3 hours (again) in an airport. Having filed the report, I received an email acknowledging the delayed bag. 12 hours later a second email came through, informing me that my bag had been located and will be put on the plane the next morning. So it never left from its transfer location once again. In addition, an airline which does not provide in-flight entertainment for flights longer than 4 hours, needs a serious review. Needless to say, I will not be using TAP again. The only positive about this airline is the staff on the ground - extremely nice and helpful.

### "Terrible service"
TAP Portugal moved the departure of my flight from Amsterdam to Lisbon by two hours. Therefore I could not take the connecting flight from Lisbon to Miami. Plus, even though they knew in advance, I was not notified. When I tried to check in and noticed the problem called their contact number. It took almost 20 minutes for a representative to take the call. He only offered moving the flight one day or taking the flight to Lisbon and waiting there if they "could" at some point book me with another airline. They did not offer booking me in advance with a partner airline so that I could get to Miami on time to see my family. Terrible service. I am extremely disappointed with that airline.

### "Personnel were extremely rude and unhelpful"
Worst airline ever. 5 flights altogether with TAP Portugal flying from Terceira to Nantes via Lisbon, all delayed and no apologies given. The food is disgusting. Personnel were extremely rude and unhelpful. The aircraft was dirty. A/C turned the plane into a fridge. I shall never fly with them again.

### "Service very efficient"
Flew Dusseldorf to New York JFK via Lisbon. Perfect flight again with TAP. Short haul flight made on E190 Jet. Got my special meal and got even 2nd main course as too much meals boarded. Though 30 min delayed made my conection in LIS without any problem. Baggage load confirmed by a super sympatic purser on the long haul flight. This flight already had already TAP's new business class seats which were very confortable. Service very efficient and meal very good. Amenity Kit is very likely the most original flying around at the moment. Made my neigboor thinking it is a real tin of sardines. We made it on time though thunderstorms in New York area forcing captain taking a more southern route as usual. Safety first, thanks to him.

### "not choose this airline again"
Amsterdam to Lisbon return. Double the delay of the low cost carriers although double the price. Lousy food. Arrogant but slow and clumsy staff. Seat comfort is an absolute minimum. EasyJet flies this route but chose TAP for timely and quality experience. What a deception. I would not choose this airline again!

### "Crew were efficient, professional and friendly"
Flight from Lisbon to Manchester was delayed by an hour due the late arrival of the incoming aircraft. Boarded efficiently. The cabin was 2x2 comfortable leather leather seats with good legroom (I'm 6 foot). Fare included seat allocation, hold baggage and snacks/drinks. Crew were efficient, professional and friendly. Flight arrived forty minutes late. Generally a great flight and I'd recommend TAP Portugal.

### "Clean and confortable cabins"
Porto to Berlin return via Lisbon. Uneventful flights, leaving on time and arrived before schedule. Clean and confortable cabins. Crew were professional and smiling. Catering service - poor sandwich but very good beverages. We were a group of 7 and we purchased our tickets several months in advance so we paid a very good price compared with compettion (including low-cost airlines).

### "airline can be recommended"
Lisbon to Barcelona. The flight attendants put on a stellar performance of their duties with a smile on their face, attending to requests concerning beverages. The snack of a cheese sandwich each time was palatable enough. The seats had adequate pitch and the cabin was clean. The arrival had a negligible delay. The airline can be recommended for a flight within the continent to and from Portugal.

### "outrageous luggage fee"
Barcelona to Lisbon. We were charged €35 for a suitcase with a 22kg limit for a flight that is under two hours. The most outrageous and unjustifiable fee I have experienced. Lucky we only had one suitcase to check in per person, the second suitcase costs €70! Check fees carefully before purchasing your ticket, you might find a better priced ticket if you include the outrageous luggage fee.

### "terrible customer service"
Terrible customer service. TAP Portugal flight from Rio to London via Lisbon was overbooked and they offered passengers 300 euro to fly with another airline. The only problem is - when I call for an update on my refund, the customer service agents hang up on me! Each time I call I get a different answer, first they could not process the refund due to me not having a Brazilian bank account (I've never lived there), second they told me I must have a Brazilian bank account because I paid in 'reals' which was also incorrect - I paid in Australian dollars and on the third call the customer service rep asked me to send the original refund document in the mail to the head office (Lisbon) in order to receive the refund. When I began to explain that I would not be doing that as I didn't trust it would be handled correctly, I was hung up on. Horrible experience.

### "does not seem to care"
Lisbon to Porto. First, they overbooked our early morning flight to Porto. We had no seats and were on standby, asked to check in every hour to see if there was an available seat. There was a flight from Lisbon to Porto every hour with all flights being overbooked! We ended up waiting 7 hours (checking every hour for a seat) till finally after pleading with customer service we got on. We asked them several times to make sure our checked bags got on the right flight (being on standby we had no idea where our bags were). We were assured the bags would be on which ever flight we got on. Knowing how incompetent this airline was, we double checked with customer service. Well guess what? When we finally arrived to Porto our bags were nowhere to be found! We spent the little time in Porto with no extra change of clothes and constantly checking in to see if our bags were found. This airline does not seem to care about their customers or establishing great customer service. The event tarnished our Portugal experience.

### "crew members were very rude"
Porto to Paris Orly. I bought a business class ticket, and when I was seated, the cabin crew announce that there was no service because the lack of cabin crew members. I request if they couldn´t do service on business class, because I was the only one, and the crew rudely told me no. During the flight they only offered me a glass of water. Cabin crew members were very rude, the weren´t polite at all. TAP Portugal never again.

### "Awful customer service"
Lisbon to Valencia. Awful customer service! The staff does not know what politbess means. The staff at the gate almost forced me to not take my suitcase on board, even though in the ticket nothing was said about the size of the aircraft and it was clearly stated that two bags were allowed on board. The lady was arguing with me till the last second! For the prices they charge they should teach their staff how to behave.

### "Seats were comfortable"
Rome to Funchal via Lisbon. The flight left Rome with a delay of over two hours due to crew rest restrictions. The flight in Economy was very nice on two recently refurbished A320s. Seats were comfortable and the in-flight service attentive. Food was sandwiches which were decent. Unfortunately on the second leg we had to divert to a nearby airport (PXO) after holding for some 15 minutes due to crosswind exceeding the maximum value. The crew handled this situation well by keeping smiling and to exuding calm. After waiting at PXO for about 1 hour we departed again for FNC, this time landing after a challenging approach. The crew made us feel safe during the trip.

### "worst customer service"
Milan to Newark via Lisbon. While the actual flight was enjoyable, once we landed the horrible experience begun. I picked up my suitcase from the baggage claim to find that it had been smashed. It seemed that it had been thrown since on of the corners was completely crushed as well as the extending handle had been broken. It also was probably stacked under several heavier bags since all the sides were crushed in and everything inside was compressed. TAP has a 150 Euro (~$170) bag check fee, so you would expect 150 Euros worth of service. After making the claim, we never received any confirmation that is was created. When we called, they said that there was never any claim; this launched a new claim process to verify that there was a claim. They finally verify that we did indeed make a damaged bag claim, and sent us an email address to contact. When we contacted that email they sent us a number to call. This sort of forwarding process continued on until we reached a dead end number that just goes straight to voicemail. TAP has the worst customer service imaginable.

### "Crew was very efficient"
Rio de Janeiro to Marseille via Lisbon. TAP operates now 18 A330 between Brazil and Portugal. 3 of them are ex-Singapore Airlines A330-300, 15 are A330-200. Of these 15, 4 have been retro-fitted and have new IFE and full-flat beds. I was lucky to fly on a retrofitted aircraft. It was effectively a brand new experience in most aspects. It is now similar to LH or AF, except for drinks, as TAP unfortunately serves sparkling, red and white wines from Portugal exclusively. Crew was very efficient, smiley, food was tasty. New lounge in Lisbon, beautiful, with nice choice of food. Lisbon to Marseille business class is a total waste of money or miles, as there is no difference expect a small cold meal.

### "customer service absolutely terrible"
To say this airline shouldn't even be in business is an understatement. The customer service has been absolutely terrible. My wife flew on a ticket booked by American Airlines from Indianapolis to Geneva, via Miami and Lisbon. There was a weather delay getting into Miami and she missed her connection to Lisbon. The Ticket counter for TAP Portugal was closed and so she called Travelocity. Travelocity called Tap Portugal who apparently said "it's not our problem, call American who issued the ticket. Travelocity called American who reissued the ticket. All of this was done in about an hour on the phone thanks to the delays from TAP. Then I got an email four hours later saying that TAP had cancelled the ticket. I called Travelocity who called American. American said the ticket was issued and everything was good to go. I called TAP because I wanted to make sure she wouldn't be stranded, and they said they had cancelled the ticket and "no, it's not our problem". When I pressed them for a reason they transferred me to someone else who told me that American had reissued the ticket "incorrectly". And they would continue to cancel it until it was issued correctly. I had to press him to tell what was incorrect about the issuing of the ticket. It turns out it is because the ticket was issued from initially from Indianapolis to Geneva and the reissue had been from Miami to Geneva. So I called Travelocity back, who called American who of course explained, if she is already in Miami, they wouldn't issue her a ticket from Indianapolis. So now after three hours of phone time I'm on hold waiting for Travelocity to call Tap Portugal and try to resolve this non-issue. To say this airline shouldn't even be in business is an understatement. Travelocity has come back on the line and reported that everything is cleared up with TAP and she should be ok to fly out tonight. I hope so, but this has been just ridiculous. I recommend that you stay far away from making any booking with this airline. I wouldn't ever consider it again.

### "service on board was mediocre"
TAP Portugal flight from Funchal to Lisbon departed more than 3 hours late. Ended up reaching destination in the middle of the night (2-3 am). During the delay staff at the airport gave a voucher of 6 eur. When confronted with passengers indignation told she wanted to be at home too. Service on board was mediocre with a simple sandwich (filled with mayonnaise) delivered by hand to passengers.

### "Absolutely not worth it"
Helsinki to Lisbon in business. Absolutely not worth it. The most expensive breakfast ever. Shortly after take off the breakfast was served. It was nothing special. After the service you didn't get any contact to staff. They gathered together behind the curtain to read and chat. Every now and then - and that was not very often - they hurried to the back of the aircraft, but avoiding any kind of eye contact. Luggage had priority tag, but delivered among the last ones. Never again. Lisbon - Helsinki in economy. The flight departed just before midnight. Dinner was served and it was much better than the breakfast in business. There was even a second drink service.

### "the journey was pleasant"
Toronto to Faro via Lisbon. We are a family of 4 and we travelled with TAP Portugal for first time. The journey was pleasant (as much as it can be with 2 young children). We received blankets and pillows and a pair of headphones, each seat had a tv screen with movies and games and we got 2 very decent meals (free). The flight attendants were exceptional. We have been flying for a long time now, and I have noticed that the quality of the services in economy class have gone considerably down in most of the airlines. Last year, we travelled with another very well known company (8 hours flight) and we had to pay for everything, blankets, meals, etc. Was dreadful and the price of the ticket was slightly higher than what we paid now with TAP. Many companies could learn of TAP, and I wish our next journey is as good as this one. Surely we will look first to fly with TAP.

### "A detestable airline"
Awful experiences. First leg with TAP from Madrid to Porto. After 1 hour waiting, they announced a delay, which turned out to be one hour later to a cancellation. No information and only 1 person could help. We got a voucher given access to a light meal and  after 5 hours waiting time take an alternative carrier (Air Europa). Second leg, Porto to Lisbon again a not annonced delay. We got "lucky" only 1 hours delay. A detestable airline that I will avoid at all cost for the future!

### "such an awful experience"
Hamburg to Lisbon. We have never had such an awful experience with an airline. The flight was overbooked by 20 people. At the point where we already had out boarding passes, we were told we could not board. No alternative flights could be found for us for 4 days. According to EU regulations, passengers are entitled to 400 euros compensation and a refund in this situation. We were given vouchers to this effect but no instructions as to how to submit them. Many automated phone calls and emails to customer service addresses with automated responses later, we remain unsure of whether we will ever be able to reclaim this money. A thoroughly terrible airline.

### "service was very good"
It was a very nice flight from Paris Orly to Lisbon. It seems that TAP has reached a consistency on the quality of its service, which is good to see. The service was very good, with very polite staff. Attentive too. The aircraft was clean and the seats were brand new, although the aircraft was not. The seats were comfortable, though.

### "aircraft was also clean and tidy"
Flew TAP from Lisbon to Paris Orly. It was a regular flight, actually. Nothing much to note. The crew were nice, the aircraft was good, albeit not the newest in the fleet. The aircraft was also clean and tidy. The flight left on time and arrived also on time, which is a big improvement for TAP, who used to be late all the time a couple of years ago!

### "55 min flight took 5 hours
Will never ever fly TAP Portugal again. 55 min flight from Lisbon to Madrid ended up taking 5 hours. Plane delayed for nearly 3 hours, then fly 30 mins pass Madrid, finally over an hour to collect luggage, as machine broke after putting out on wrong belt. Have flown many airlines none as bad as these.

### "very disappointing experience"
Book my trip from Toronto to Lisbon. While in Lisbon I also booked flight to Barcelona then to Prague. Flight from Prague to Lisbon was delayed without notification and announcements. Flight was scheduled to leave at 6:00 am and was delayed until 16:20 which I will missed my flight from Lisbon to Toronto departing at 18:45. I mentioned to the check-in agent. They asked me to speak to speak with the agent at TAP counter. The agent told me there was nothing showing on their system that I have a ticket flying back to Toronto from Lisbon. I showed her my email confirmation and told me there is anything she can do since it's a separate ticket. She told to call TAP customer service. Is she expecting someone from foreign country to call LD and solved this themselves? I told her it's should be TAP responsibility to ensure their customer to be able to get on their next destination on time whether it's a connect flight with same ticket or separate ticket. She finally able to get me the flight back home on the next day with not accommodation assistance or meal provided. I was strained it and has to find my own accommodation. It was a a very disappointing experience since TAP shows lack of customer service and not willing to assist their customer.

### "rate them a zero star"
Vienna to Boston via Lisbon. Initially, the date of my flight from Vienna was changed (June 20 6:30 AM to June 20 6:30 PM) without notifying me. The email sent to me stated that I had to check in in the latter time instead of the original time of my flight. I called, emailed, texted (using Facebook messenger, Skype) and provided me with no answers. So I went to the airport for the latter time they mentioned. From there airport staff could not give me boarding pass as they were unable to find my flight and to be able to catch the connecting flights (Lisbon-Boston). Stucked in Lisbon for 12 hours with no airline assistance, drained, stressed and anxious. Overall, the treatment of this airline makes me rate them a zero star.

### "very comfortable for such small aircraft"
Flew TAP Portugal from Zurich to Porto. One configuration only, however seats and space between them very comfortable for such small aircraft. They served water and half a tuna sadwich sealed in a plastic bag and unfrozen some hours ago. Better not to serve anything than to serve something like this. They forgot my bags out and they arrived next day. Before entering the aircraft I asked and I re-asked the personnel at the gate if my bags were travelling with me and they reassured me. So never trust a Swiss staff personnel. They are not know what they are doing.

### "definitely recommend"
Gatwick to Oporto. Boarding commenced approx 35mins before departure which lead to a smooth and relaxed boarding. A319 must have been recently refurbished with Recaro slimline seats which do not recline, however were comfortable and provided sufficient seat width and pitch. The seat colour scheme meant the cabin felt bright and modern. The crew were friendly and helpful throughout the flight and during the snack service offered both hot and cold drinks to each passenger. Flight departed and arrived on time. Overall a great experience and considering the cost was very similar to the other competitors on this route, I would definitely recommend TAP.

### "Crew are incredibly friendly"
Flew Lisbon to Helsinki. Great catering service accompanied with posh Portuguese wines in economy class. Pillows and blankets are available in your seat when you enter the aircraft in this night flight. Crew are incredibly friendly. However, as always, TAP manages to leave slightly delayed every time. The temperature in the cabin also tends to be too high, passengers leave their seats and wander through the corridor or just stand up blocking it. Toilets are crowded and queues are frequently formed to use them. On a last note, congratulations for them for implementing non-reclining seats as those always created problems with fellow passengers and I've more than once been the victim of a less than kind passenger who just squeezed me to my seat when its seat was reclined. Shame about their call center though.

### "cabin crew were amazing"
Manchester to Lisbon. This was the friendliest flight I have ever been on, the cabin crew were amazing, nothing was too much trouble and they cared about their customers. We had plenty of leg room and the plane was immaculate. As a family we would like to say a huge thank you to the crew.

### "the food was poor"
Vienna to Lisbon. Checking at the Senator dedicate desk really helps (Austrian Airline people are always kind) 25 minutes to get my upgrade! !TAP is not friendly in upgrades even in Lisbon so you can imagine in another country and in particular if they don’t have an office representative (and to be honest is better that way most of the times). But I did get it, was A330 so was a good investment. Old with seats and TV from the 80s but is ok for 3 hour flight. Crew was friendly, the food was poor even in business. No magazines, no WiFi, not even a simple journal - bring your iPhone and read in on your iPhone.

### "worst long-haul flight experienced"
My trip with TAP Portugal from Brasilia to Lisbon, all in all is the worst long-haul flight I have ever experienced. The cabin crew were rude (not just unsmiling), inflight entertainment poor, the cabin was dated and equipped with very narrow seats, the meals were horrible and served on a dirty folding tray. A horrible 9-hour flight.

### "comfort and legroom very good"
Second time flown with retroffited aircraft from TAP. The new cabin is a huge improvement, looking much nicer and brighter than the old interior. Seat comfort and legroom very good at least in row 5 were I was sitting (cannot judge back of the plane where they use another seat with obviously less legroom). At my seat socket for electricity and holder for tablet available. Crew nice and attentive. No need to mention the usual barely existing catering. At least you still get (alcoholic) drinks as beer and nice red and white wine for free in economy. In total a nice experience.

### "not bad, not good"
A321 Lisbon to Brussels with TAP Portugal. Flight in economy class. Best sit in 10C (one of the best seats). This is one of the very few aircraft that TAP have with a configuration of a Lufthansa (normal) cabin. And of course guess what? It is a good one. Very nice space for the legs and seats are new. The service is what you can consider a normal, not bad, not good. I did get the same crew the day before on another flight. Some service was the same, today they did have the curtains to separate the classes. So was not a Ryanair flight. Aircraft was half empty, so was a pleasant flight. Of course no WiFi, no magazines, no journals etc. During the flight the crew manager welcomed passengers and Victoria members on the PA system. The funny part was when he said that the Victoria members voted the program one of the best in Europe. I don’t know how this works but did they really know the nightmare of spending Miles on a TAP award ticket to Brazil. I tried 5 times this year (just an example) to buy the ticket with an upgrade. All those 5 times it was not possible with a window of 10 months. I could not even upgrade myself yesterday on an empty flight in the premium centre in Lisbon.

### "a new kind of Ryanair"
Warsaw to Lisbon on a A320. Upgraded from Economy to Business using Plus grade offer in TAP in there website. We have a new twist on the TAP Airline, now the business and the economy class go together, no separation on the plane even. Welcome to a new kind of Ryanair or easyJet. Nothing there in the aircraft, normally there is a curtain but even that is gone. I normally don’t do upgrades. Don’t work really (on the short and medium flights (on TAP) and allow me to explain why. The aircraft has the same seats, now even the first row has lost space. You have the seat in the middle free but this is one of the few if not the only bonus). The food on TAP is just bad food. Food in economy is even worst but in Business easily you eat better in economy on Air France or Lufthansa. If you have a Gold Star alliance card (my case) why pay the upgrade. We already have, fast track, lounge etc. So really 110 Euros for 1500 Miles more is just bad business. On top of that the Business Class of TAP on short and medium flights has nothing to offer. Not even a single newspaper. They will tell you to buy an iPad an download but if don’t have this - well good luck. It doesn’t pay off really, the service, the food, the things they don’t offer or have stopped offering during the recent years. And the critical factor - the crew look and act so many times like government tax representatives. Overhead bins in business class full of airline service material. The service, well you sit on the aircraft and the can be taking off and they will no even offer you a glass of anything. If you ask they will bring. That’s all. I am Portuguese, but this is what we have. There is no wifi on board, no entertainment, no newspapers - it is an easyJet flight. They offer you the TAP Magazine.

### " not bad not good, just normal"
Lisbon to Warsaw on an A320 with new seats. Service is normal, not bad not good, just normal (can be dramatically better). Poor food but in economy you cant expect better. The new seats are better is true, still all interior is new and if you look at the carpets (and they new also) they already look like 4 or 5 years in use. The seats have USB charger and electric DC power also, so a good improvement. Boarding the aircraft in Lisbon is always an aggravation with the flights from TAP, the arrows with the boarding classes are confusing, and is a mess - always a mess, they can learn with from KLM or Lufthansa.

### "very pleasant surprise"
Flew TAP Portugal from London Heathrow to Lisbon on the 19th of May. Very pleasant surprise with the retrofitted planes, brand new seats with USB charger in the Premium Economy seats what is very convenient. The flight left the stand at Heathrow on time and arrived in Lisbon 10 min ahead schedule. Crew were very professional, served a small meal (tasty sandwich) and also free drinks, rare thing these days in European airlines. Nothing negative to note.

### "a great experience with this airline"
Short flight from Lisbon to Porto in a Turbo prop plane (TAP Express). Rather comfortable aircraft and quiet flight. We left 10 min late due to some wait for connecting passengers but still arrived in Porto at scheduled time. For the short 50 min flight the crew served one drink plus a little appetizer that I must admit was rather tasty. Again a great experience with this airline.

### "delayed by nearly an hour"
TAP Portugal flight from Heathrow to Lisbon was delayed by 1 hour because it arrived late. Our return flight from Porto to Gatwick had been brought forward an hour which meant breakfast at 0500. Take-off was then delayed by nearly an hour. The aircraft was at the stand and had presumably been there overnight. We waited 50 minutes to board. I assume that staff were late and this has a knock-on effect for the rest of the day. I see that "Airhelp" has TAP as the worst European airline for delay compensation. My guess is that this is another state-funded airline where the staff have all the rights and the customers none. The inflight food was a roll with a thin smear of something cream and green and unidentifiable!

### "drained and totally disappointed"
Funchal to Lisbon. If you need to call them, be prepared to wait at least 15 min to half an hour. Once you finally reach them without losing your mind, they couldn't care less about your questions or problems and make sure to express how much they hate you for calling them. Don't try reaching them by e-mail either, you will be lucky to get a reply but unfortunately (and unsurprisingly) it won't be the answer you needed and there is a big chance it will have nothing to with your own question in first place. Their website is just an extension of this airline's terrible customer service. It doesn't work properly. If, for instance, you log in to your TAP Victoria account, it is very likely that after you've given your credit card details it will appear an error message, something related to having expired the time to book your flight (I am guessing they give you like a minute and a half for that!) and you then have to contact their incompetent staff only to be asked to give your credit card details again, by phone! They say you can manage your booking through their website which is again a lie! It is simply not possible to change your flight for another day through their website. The website is not clear and doesn't load properly even if using a recent browser. Scandalous prices on the domestic route I frequently fly only adds to the hate this airline seems to preciously cherish with their clients. Their attitude is: We don't care! You need us and we don't need you! If you need an invoice/receipt of your flights and you happen to make any mistake on the details given be prepared for a pure nightmare with them to alter it. They will make you wonder if you are speaking the same language after all. Dealing with these people will left you drained and totally disappointed.

### "flight was surprisingly pleasant"
Lisbon to Munich. Lisbon airport was very busy in the morning with long lines at check-in. All agents friendly amidst the chaos, but it could all have been a bit swifter. Plane departed some 15 min late and landed almost on time. The flight was surprisingly pleasant for a inner-European hop: very friendly crew, decent small sandwiches and a good cup of coffee.

### " Not worth its price"
Paris Orly to Rio de Janeiro via Lisbon. Great people at Orly Check-in as well as at Orly lounge. New Orly lounge remains as poorly catered as previous one. A321 new Europe Business Class is a shame. No welcome drink, no smile, poor cold food, economy seat, etc as mentioned by numerous reviewers. Not worth its price. To be avoided. Lounge at Lisbon overcrowded as usual, with a bad smell. No towel or shampoo in showers. You bring yours or you pay Euros 15,00 for a ridiculous kit. Old A332, with no on-demand IFE, and lie-flat beds. FA service was spectacular however.

### "disappointing way of travelling"
Yesterday I flew from Terceira via Lisbon to Milan, and the flights were lousy and so disappointing. Opening TAP's Inflight Magazine we can read on the first pages "Europe's Leading Airline" (also in Business Class!). TAP is a very mediocre, and for sure not a good airline! No priority boarding. No welcome drink in Business Class. crew are not motivated and helpful. The seat comfort in Business Class is just awful. I am 178cm tall but even after a 2 hours flight my body hurts everywhere. So hard, so worn out, so uncomfortable. Food was acceptable but not good. With a green herb salad you can not do anything wrong. Alcatra com batata-doce was okay but not tasty. Pudim de Maracujá was third class. The drink selection was good. No inflight entertainment, no monitors which would even show you the flight route. They even stopped with their inflight duty free sales. I paid 456€ for a one way ticket, while exactly the same flight was bookable in Economy Class at 70€. That means I paid 650% more for the same lousy seat as Economy passengers had. The Business Class Lounge in Lisbon was more than just crowded. The air was sticky, no working air condition. Drink selection is ok. Food selection is very poor and lousy. Lisbon Airport (after entering the terminal until you get to security check) looks dreadful. The Duty Free area and new shops in that new oval part of Lisbon Airport look good and fresh. But the boarding gates area as well look so terribly worn out and disappointing. It is a very disappointing way of travelling. No comfort, no luxury, no style.

### "I will never fly TAP again"
Lisbon to London Heathrow. TAP's policy for hand luggage is a tiny bag and less than 8KG. On the return trip I made sure to have less than 8KG, but they still took my bag away from me because of size. I was watching other passengers and many of them had their bags removed on both legs of my journey. Everyone was getting angry, but the staff didn't seem to really care. Leg room is really poor on this particular plane and you're kind of squashed in like sardines. They also have a bizarre boarding system of groups of A, B and C and for some reason they boarded people in the back rows last, so there was the inevitable long queue of people in the plane waiting for others in front of them. So it took ages to board. I will never fly TAP again.

### "never received an answer"
My review is about customer service of TAP Portugal. The service onboard was okay, as expected on a short flight. The problem started when boarding in Lisbon. I was told, in an unfriendly manner, to hand over my carry on trolley to be put in hold. The reason was a full flight. Which in the end was not the case. There would have been room for my carry on. At Amsterdam airport my trolley was damaged. The case was torn and can no longer be used. I showed the damage to the local representative. She filed a report and gave me instructions how to proceed. It took some trouble to find the complaints section on the sight but I managed and uploaded the evidence. I must give the airline credit to responding very quickly however the reply was very disappointing. 3 years ago I bought the trolley and TAP offered to reimburse about 50% of the cost. I replied and complained about their customer service but, unsurprisingly, never received an answer.

### "The flight was enjoyable"
Lisbon to Ponta Delgada. To start with, boarding was abnormally long. Once inside the plane, I was pleased to find out how much nicer the new cabins are from the previous version I had experienced 2 months ago. Front seats with red accents, middle seats with yellow accents and I think the back ones were green, as in the Portuguese flag, very nice touch, lovely design, portuguese but not stereotypically portuguese. Once I reached my seat, there was so much pitch for my legs I thought I was on the wrong place and had seated on executive class or something, the new seats are much thinner, giving you much more knee room, are much more functional and comfortable with adjustable headrests and with handy usb and charger ports (you just don't find that in your average short/medium haul flights). The airplane looked clean, smart and very modern. Crew was friendly and helpful but catering was a bit poor, just a sandwich, a drink and coffee, no dessert, no hand wipe, no tray to serve the food and the bread wasn't all that fresh and tasty. The flight was enjoyable. We had a slight delay when departing and at arrival but no more than 10minutes, which was better than average for the last flight of the day, usually those are always late. Service is much nicer than before but still a bit behind other European companies as there is still no entertainment system or wi-fi and electronic newspapers are only available if you have their frequent flyer program card, that is a shame. Luggage allowance was very good for this price range, allowing me to carry 2 bags and up to 43kg on economy! I hope they keep in the right track and keep improving their service.

### "everything was very clean and tidy"
This was just a short commuter flight from Porto to Lisbon as part of the Ponte Aérea service from TAP. It was a small ATR plane, with just 70 seats and so, I wasn't expecting much. Check-in was fast but they med a mess with my pet carrier box, they insisted I had to get a soft one but never was I told that when booking or reserving for the pet itself. In fact, I had been told I should bring a hard carrier for the first outbound trip done by Azores Airlines, in codeshare with TAP Portugal. The lady at the counter even told me this requirement was over an year old when just last December I had flown with TAP Portugal and carried my pet in the same hard carrier and no one said a word about it. Fortunately the check-in lady was nice and helpful and called her supervisor to sort things out and all was solved. The flight was late and boarding was a bit slow. The airplane looked and probably was brand new, with a smart, modern and chic interior, much to my taste. Everything was very clean and tidy. No entertainment system was present, but that was expected for a 50 minutes flight. The airplane was very quiet and the amount of space was surprisingly decent, just a bit short on foot space. Catering wise it was bad. A coffee and a little biscuit, that is right, one biscuit. Nothing more. It was a shame there was no Wi-Fi service. Crew were friendly and helpful and the route taken lead to same nice view of the country shore line. I have to say that these Ponte Aérea TAP Portugal service have some advantages over low cost airliners on the same route, like more baggage allowance, a small (very small) snack and the availability to change for a previous or next flight if you please. All in all, it was a pleasant flight.

### "business class facilities awful"
Flew business class from London to Lisbon, was ok. Then connected from Lisbon to Accra and the business class facilities were awful. No inflight entertainment, no power sockets so I could work and charge laptop, no wi-fi, cramped seating, was an awful experience and not worth the money at all. I would strongly recommend paying a little more for a true business class ticket/flight with another airline. That said staff were friendly and very apologetic over the lack of facilities available for business class passengers but still did not address the sheer mis-representation of TAP Portugal on their business class service. One word, appalling.

### "I wouldn't recommend it"
Newark to Gatwick via Porto. Online check in is relatively easy but you have to pay extra to reserve your seats ahead of time. Boarded the plane, seat very uncomfortable, In-flight entertainment the size of my iPhone 6, and not started until takeoff. The Entertainment is also channel based so you can't control when the movie starts. Service and crew very good answering our questions. Food isn't very good, on our flight fish and beef option consisting of heap tilapia and a attempt at shepherd's pie. Then they shut the IFE mid flight so I had nothing to do. Flight was pretty torturous but we did finally arrive on time in Porto. Then we ran to our next flight with a 40 min connection and we actually made it early. You can get through the airport in 5 min if you go up the escalator to connections. Second flight was 2 hrs and was fine. Got us there on time, and is worth it for the value, but I wouldn't recommend it otherwise. Their long haul A330's are very old and the IFE is outdated.

### "TAP is not worth the money"
Fortaleza to Lisbon. Overall TAP is not worth the money. Food was really tasteless, even more they offered only one meal choice because the second option was out of stock after row one. Worn out seats and entertainment programm is a joke. TV screens has nearly the size of my mobile phone.

### "dread having to use them"
Lisbon to Copenhagen. I've just started using TAP Portugal, the IOS app is abysmal, the web site more so and customer service a joke. Their IT is clearly faulty, untested and not fit for purpose. I dread having to use them. I've had so many things go wrong with every flight, you just can't get through to them. 9/10 flights I book with them (I book more than 4 a month) have app / booking / payment issues. They take no responsibility, they simply take your money and hide.

### "not able to provide me with a seat"
London Heathrow to Lisbon. It has high range price for a service that does not even reach Ryanair or easyjet. Second time in a week that the airline has overbooked a flight and is not able to provide me with a seat number and putting me on standby. This is unacceptable as once a flight is booked it should be honoured. Have tried getting in contact with their customer service and it seems to be non existent, the number they have provided for the UK does not work and no one replies to the emails or messages through facebook! Totally unacceptable and rubbish service. If you cannot guarentee a seat a full refund must be provided

### "thought I had experienced the worst"
Having previously reviewed this airline on a GIG-LIS Business Class trip, which was not so-Business Class, I thought that I had experienced the worst. Unfortunately, I experienced worse conditions on LIS-ORY. Lounge in LIS was packed, with no seats. Flight was 1h30 delayed. Boarding was a mess. Business Class seat on new retrofitted A321 was exactly as of economy class. Worst even as only row number 1 was allowed to business class, with a wall in front of us, and no space for feet/knees. We understand that most European airlines are trying to compete with LCs,however pretending to keep high price/revenue Business Class pax in smaller pitch is a scandal.

### "worn-out uncomfortable lie-flat seats"
Flew from Rio de Janeiro to Lisbon. TAP Portugal insists on selling Business Class tickets on aircrafts where comfort is unacceptable. CS-TOF A330 for instance has very worn-out uncomfortable lie-flat seats and entertainment is not on demand. Therefore 4 movies that you cannot choose are on display on 4 different channels, that's all, and you cannot stop them. Food was just edible. Wines Ok. Extremely pleasant staff however that deserves true congratulations.

### "it is downright dishonest"
Terrible first, and last, experience flying "business class" with TAP from Lisbon to Accra. The aircraft was a short-haul A319 with only economy seats - narrow, uncomfortable, minimal recline (10°?) and no legroom. No onboard entertainment, not even a free newspaper. How can they call that business class? When I checked with the economy class, the only difference was that a free seat is guaranteed between the seats (2 x 3 across the aisle) - and, even then, much of the economy section was empty. So I paid a business class ticket for an economy class seat. To sell these seats as business class is not just misleading, it is downright dishonest!

### "a bit more expensive than Ryanair"
Flew Brussels to Lisbon. I always fly with Ryanair when I'm flying within Europe. TAP Portugal was a bit more expensive than Ryanair so I thought I would give it a try. The plane was in size the same as Ryanair, maybe even with less legroom. They offered one drink and coffee/tea and a sandwich. If you're vegetarian like me, you get nothing. They only offer one sandwich and it's a small one. it's not that difficult to make a sandwich without the ham! On the return trip the flight was an hour too late.

### "keep up the good work"
Madrid to Lisbon. Very small plane, we had a late connection arrival at the airport had to run to get the plane and when we got to the plane the staff told us they knew and they were waiting, not to be very nervous. I have found it to be the best comeback to TAP in years. Hope they keep up the good work.

### "the service has improved"
Lisbon to Madrid. Nice flight for the first time TAP Portugal seems to surprise me, with nice staff, nice people, new retrofit plane even with USB charger. Very well TAP, will continue to fly with you because the service has improved, but they have to improve on the ages of planes.

### "I got a broken seat"
Lisbon to Berlin. Old plane, I got a broken seat, plane smell bad, we were driven to the middle of the tarmac to get the plane. The cabin staff are young and helpful the flight went ok. But one bad thing is about to happen tomorrow, I am on waiting list they overbooked and I might stay on ground, this is not correct since I have flight booked for 3 months and have to be in Lisbon.

### "meal service was a rush with tasteless food"
❎ Unverified |  Fortaleza, Brazil (FOR) to Lisbon (LIS) in C on CS-TOH (A330-200) on 07/03/2017. Got upgrade to C for a “promotional” fare and was extremely disappointed. Compared to SQ, CX, EY or LX it feels like cheap premium economy. Terrible angled seats, no personal entertainment, just quite aged movies in a loop on old displays, which can’t be paused. The meal service was a rush with tasteless food served by a disinterested crew – they just wanted to smash it on the tray and go to sleep. As I asked, “Which single malt whisky could you offer” the FA replied “we have young whisky and old whisky, I don’t know the brands”. The breakfast before landing was a joke – some cuts of fruits and a bread roll with butter. Sorry, but I have had very better breakfasts in Y. In FOR TAP doesn’t have a lounge, in LIS is also no arrival lounge. The old horse CS-TOH (almost 20 years old) seems dirty and tired. All in one: TAP is a monopolist on the routes to Brazil’s secondary hubs and misuses this situation. I’d never pay the regular price for their outdated product and non-existing service. Dear TAP management, please buy a C ticket on Singapore Airlines and feel the 21st century. Your airline got stuck in 80-ties.

### "4 times the flight was delayed"
❎ Unverified |  Amsterdam to Ponta Delgada via Lisbon. We flew 4 times with TAP Portugal, 4 times the flight was delayed. If you're on a tight schedule don't fly with TAP! Unfortunately uncomfortable budget seats as well.The crew was ok I guess but information during the flight was minimal and almost inaudible. Last flight was 50 min delay on 2 hr flight and sunny weather.

### "a terrible experience"
Lisbon to Barcelona . We were travelling back to Cyprus from our Lisbon trip on an early morning, a group of 10 people. At the luggage drop off, the team that was handling the services that morning checked-in for half of us the luggage till Barcelona only, for the other half of the group till Larnaca. The lady that was handling my luggage told me her colleagues did a mistake, and that my luggage can go only to Barcelona since I am changing airlines there. I tried to explain her, that on our way to Lisbon, staff from Larnaca did the luggage check-in and the transfer directly to Lisbon regardless of airline change and we did not have to pick it up from Barcelona. The more I was trying to explain this to the lady, the more frustrated and nervous she was. Eventually we gave up, we took the plane and reached Barcelona. We had a 6 hours waiting time to our next flight to Athens. This meant we went out, took the luggage those whom did not manage to send their bags to Larnaca (due to poor services) and keep it with us for 5 hours, till Aegean Airlines opened their gate to check-in again the luggage. Why we had to go through all this trouble? Arrogant at the luggage drop off, TAP Portugal staff does not understand in 2017 that time is the most precious resource a person beholds, and they keep on providing poor assistance. All in all, a terrible experience with TAP Portugal  staff and services. They are treating you like are doing a favor in their own personal time.

### "nightmare with this airline"
Newark to Marrakech via Lisbon. Kinda a nightmare with this airline. First off, they cancelled my original flight home. So, I had to spend an extra night in Lisbon, which was actually a little fun. I got to walk around Lisbon, and I had a great dinner. TAP covered the hotel bill and it was okay. With that said, they promised to cover us for dinner, which never happened, but breakfast was included. They also provided transport. As for the flights, they could have been better. Food was so so, but you could get free beer or wine. Seats were uncomfortable. Also, beware of paying extra for seats. They switched airplanes on my flight to Lisbon, and didn't bother to switch my seat to the emergency row-even thought I paid 65 Euro for it. In the end, I got an emergency row seat, but not the one I wanted and paid for. On the way back to America, I got the proper emergency row seat, but the in-flight entertainment didn't work for me, despite several attempts to reset it. With this all in mind, the flights did fly on time, and my flight back to the US was early, which helped with my connection. All things considered, I would not fly this airline again if I can help it. Too much trouble, and I was one of the lucky ones. I was part of a tour of Morocco where everyone flew TAP, and many people were out hundreds of dollars with the one-day delayed flight. I was lucky because I procrastinated about buying my flights to Newark and back Minnesot. Others bought their flights to Newark early, and they were out of luck.

### "stay away at all costs"
Marrakech to London via Lisbon. I have flown with many airlines including budget airlines such as Easyjet and Ryanair and I have not had such a bad experienced as I had with TAP Portugul. I arrived at the checkin desk in Marrakech to be told that I could not take the flight because it was overbooked. Meaning my seat, which I had already paid for was sold to someone else! I was told that I can board the flight if there was any seats available. So they made me wait and told me that there was one seat available half an hour before departure. So I was rushed to the aircraft last minute before it took off. I then arrived in London to discover that my luggage was left in Marrakech! I am still waiting for them to get my luggage to me, which I don't have any hope of. Apart from this bad experience I have to say that they only offer their passangers a cheap turkey sandwich, so if you're vegetarian you can just starve as they don't even sell any food onboard. Not to mention that there is hardly any leg room. I don't understand how this airline can be part of the Star Alliance. Absolutely terrible, stay away at all costs.

### "service was good as always"
This particular flight took me from Lisbon to Miami. Unfortunately, it was in an older version of the A330 so the entertainment was lacking. Instead of interactive, the movies all started on a 2 hour schedule. The bad part was that there were 2 channels dedicated to each movie and channels 1-2 weren't being used. Thus, you ended up 5 movies instead of 13. Not a big deal, but had I known, I probably would have flown back through New York. The service was good as always as was the food. For lunch they served the ubiquitous salted co, in this case made with cream (which happens to be my favorite). The pre-landing snack was not at all my cup of tea. It was a piece of bread with a side of mortadela and cheese so that you could build your own sandwich. The seats were very comfortable and even had the small foot rest which is rare these days. Aircraft departed on time and arrived 30 minutes ahead of schedule. What else could one ask for?

### "great service, and good food "
Munich to Lisbon. On this particular trip, I flew in the day prior, nonstop from Houston to Munich on United Airlines. This allowed me to spend a day and a half sightseeing before continuing the following evening to Lisbon on TAP. The flight was in the A320 and  the aircraft was well kept, with a clean and fairly new interior. The staff was very attentive and professional as I have come to expect from European carriers. What set this particular flight apart was the fact that the dinner was hot and quite good. Living in the U.S. I am accustomed to just getting pretzels and not very good ones for that matter. Yes, the staple food of the U.S. the peanut has been exchanged for an unpalatable bag of pretzels. As I was eating my Bavarian Spaetzle, I could not help wonder how it was that the food on this short 2hr trip was infinitely better in every way than the food I had eaten on my 9hr Transatlantic flight. TAP offers a perfect combination of reasonably priced tickets, great service, and good food - to top it off it is done with modern equipment that is well taken care of.

### "seats are very comfortable and nice"
New York JFK - Lisbon. I normally take UA out of EWR but TAP Portugal was much nicer since the departure was late (23.40) and the arrival into Lisbon was well after rush hour (11.30). The Recaro lie flat seats are very comfortable and nice, since they have several pre-selectable positions such as: Take Off and Landing, eating, relaxing 1 & 2 and sleeping. While you are virtually lying flat the only slight hiccup is that your feet are slightly angled downwards. The dinner was quite good and offered a selection of Shrimp, Filet or Vegetarian, I chose the steak which was good albeit a bit underdone. The cabin crew were attentive and professional throughout the flight. The entertainment system was stocked with the latest movies such as The Accountant, Bridget Jones' Baby and a few other new movies as opposed to the U.S. carriers that seem to offer a selection of movies that don't even run on HBO anymore. Overall the flight was uneventful and we even managed to arrive 45 minutes ahead of schedule. The nicest part was undoubtedly the late departure of the flight, I only made my mind up to go at 14.30 that day and I still had to get from Houston to NY.

### "Overbooking is TAP policy "
Lisbon to Casablanca. Overbooking is TAP Portugal policy apparently. I was denied boarding along with in total of 3 other passengers. Employees do not know or want to help you out with the issue. Compensation took forever to be recieved. They placed in next flight but wat good is that? They didn't even ask for volunteers to come forward to change their seat for compensation.

### "cabin crew was professional"
Did a weekend trip Gatwick to Lisbon return. Booked direct with TAP Portugal, the price was very good and the times the best to fit my needs. Both flights were on time, the cabin crew was professional, plus a little snack in both flights are always pleasant. I will continue to use them when I go to Lisbon.

### "sitting in stress, confusion"
Zurich to Marrakech via Lisbon. We wanted to celebrate our 7th wedding anniversary in Morocco and trusted TAP for our flights. Our schedule was to fly Zürich to Marrakech on 29 December, spend 1 night in Marrakech and start our Sahara Tour on 30th December at 8am. The flight was delayed and what was not appreciated is the fact that we were made waiting inside the plane without no information what was going on. Only after more than one hour of sitting in stress, confusion and cluelessness, we were informed about the Navigation problem. As consequence, we missed our connecting flight to Marrakech at 9.25am. Due to the full seat of all flights to Marrakech that day, we had to spend a night in Lisbon and flew the following day. We tried to explain to the staff that we had to fly on the same day because we already confirmed/paid several arrangements but we still had to fly on December 30th 2016, at 9.25am. Due to this delay, we missed the change to Marrakech and planned some surprises for my husband on this day were all ruined. Therefore we missed 4 hours of the tour, leaving out some of the destinations planned, and arrived so late in our hotel. 10 days later. We came home from Morocco, sat on the plane and was announced that they're the best airline (too busy being shocked to hear which media that appointed them).

### "the worst internet site"
Porto to Gatwick with TAP Portugal. Probably the worst internet site it has been my experience to deal with and as for the Vitoria programme (when you can get into it) is even worse. As for trying to contact the company using their advertised numbers (landline and Skype) a total waste of time. Get the feeling I'm frustrated. Nothing wrong with the flying experience but that's it.

### "not a real business class"
London Heathrow to Accra via Lisbon with TAP Portugal. The first thing I noticed was that this was not a real business class. It was the normal three seats, but the middle seat no one was allowed to sit. I could not fathom not having any inflight entertainment. The flight was delayed from London for 2 hours, we sat on the runway waiting to move with not even a choice of water while we waited. We therefore arrived in Lisbon 2 hours late and therefore missing my connecting flight. While in Lisbon it was utter confusion as no one knew where to go. TAP in their infinite wisdom scheduled another flight for us on Royal Air Maroc without telling us. Our baggage went missing and we had to go to Lost and Found to locate our luggage. One of the rudest people I have ever met in Lost and Found told us we had to wait anywhere from half our to an hour while they locate our luggage, which would be sent to the baggage area. While we waited we had to stand as there were no chairs. When we asked Lost and Found if they could speed the process as we might miss the new connecting flight, the rude staff said "you have to wait" as she continued looking at her computer screen. While we waited for the new flight and airline, TAP did not offer us any food or drinks while we waited. I however thank them for the change of airline Royal Air Maroc, as they were much better than TAP Portugal.

### "if you can, avoid the A340"
Hamburg to Miami via Lisbon in business class. This was a mixed experience. The short flight from Hamburg on an old A319 was okay. In business, TAP Portugal simply leave the middle seat open. Space and recline are limited. I had a window seat and found it pretty narrow. Would probably choose the aisle seat next time. No welcome drink. Only after 30 minutes in the air the service started. Breakfast was average. Staff friendly and professional. On request I got a pillow and a blanket. Flight from Lisbon to Miami on outdated A340-300 was below my expectation for the hard product. The seats were at least 20 years old and some parts were shaking and moving. Space is very limited (especially for feet in lie-flat position). Seats have and angle when flat. So for a day flight it was okay. At night I would avoid this airplane. Foot was between good and very good but small portions. I had three shrimps and something funny as side for main course. The Service was good and friendly but once they forgot to bring me my espresso and then they skipped me with the obviously nice chocolate selection. So all in all I would recommend the airline if you can avoid the A340 (especially when the price is a real bargain like in my case). Will return on the A330 and write another review to compare them.

### "nice and communicative crew"
A319 from Frankfurt to Lisbon (CS-TTF) seemed to be recently retrofitted. Nice and spacious seats (6F) with power supply and ipad holder. Very nice and communicative crew. Flight on time. Captain welcoming the passengers with two extensive announcements. Nice experience in a very smooth flight.

### "personal space was not so good"
TAP Portugal flight from Lisbon to Munich. This flight was okay. The main reason I had chose it was the price. The staff were not so friendly, but ok. During the flight the served a sandwich and drinks, including wine, if you like it. The personal space was not so good. The rows are narrow if you are over 1.70m. Plane and seating was otherwise okay and was well maintained. Boarding was a little bit chaotic, but ok. We arrived MUC nearly on time.

### "legroom was very limited"
Sao Paulo to Manchester via Lisbon. TAP Portugal was the worst airline I have ever travelled with. The cabin crew were not particularly helpful. The food was awful and the legroom was very limited. The entertainment was poor also. I would not advise flying with this airline. I will pay more than go with TAP again.

### "cabin crew was very nice and attentive"
I travelled before with TAP Portugal, and had (almost) good experiences. This time I flew business from Lisbon to Newark. The check-in service on the ground was efficient and quick. The plane took-off on time. The seats were not (on this particurlarly aircraft) very comfortable as they are not new (good pitch but not a flatbed). The service (for a 7hr flight) was very good, good meal options and quality (one lunch and a snack before landing). The IFE system is, unfortunatly, the very downside (individual screens - very small for business - with few options and not possible to pause or choose a movie of your interest), as also this plane didn't have any wi-fi connections. The cabin crew was very nice and attentive. Arrival at EWR ahead schedule. Bagage on the belt when I came down from passaport control (I was onde of the first passengers leaving the aircraft).

### "recommend avoiding this airline"
London Heathrow to Miami via Lisbon. I was happy to find a flight under $500 rt from Miami to London, so I booked with TAP Portugal despite never having flown with them before. The trip to London (via Lisbon) was long and draining, but not terrible. The trip back, however, was something I would not wish to relive. First, although I could choose my seat on the legs to Europe, policy had apparently changed during the week that I spent in London, so I was unable to choose my seat for the way home without paying 30 GBP. When I called to complain about this policy change, I was basically told too bad, so sad. I went ahead and paid the fee, because of course my assigned seat was in the middle of a 4-person row for the long-haul flight. This was even more infuriating when I realized that the plane was maybe 1/3 to 1/2 full and most people seemed to have a full row to spread out in (I did not, as more people were assigned to my row, leaving only one empty seat). The woman in front of me immediately slammed her seat back as far as it would go. I'm only 5'3" and never have problems with leg room on planes, but her head was basically in my lap the entire nine hours. To top it off, the way the television screen was situated, it was now about 3" in front of my nose, which made reading, eating, or doing anything pretty much impossible. The flight attendants offered two meals and two drinks throughout long flight. I did call a couple of times for additional beverages, which I got. I'm not sure why they didn't offer drinks more often, as they do on other airlines for international or long haul flights. There was no in-seat power or wifi or USB charging port available. I would have liked to have been able to charge my phone. On the way to Europe, there was a good entertainment system with dozens of movies and television shows to watch in both English and Portuguese, but on the way home, there were 6 movies offered at any given time, and none were anything I was remotely interested in. The experience in Lisbon airport was a disaster, but I believe that was more the airport's issue and not the fault of TAP Portugal. Overall, you get what you pay for. It was worth it to deal with the nonsense to be able to go to London; if I had not found a cheap flight, I probably wouldn't have gone. If you can make it work some other way, though, I recommend avoiding this airline (and don't travel through Lisbon airport if you can help it! ).

### "the horrible service"
Valencia to Praia via Lisbon. We landed in Oporto instead of Lisbon, because of fog we were told. After about 6 hours in Oporto we flew to Lisbon. We were late for our connecting flight. This was very inconveniencing, but was just the beginning. They gave us a taxi, hotel and meal, then we flew to our destination the next day. Coming back to Lisbon from Cabo Verde, our flight was late for no apparent reason. One of the three of us got through passport control and security faster than the other two. He was the last to board. The other two of us were in a different passport control line, as per the rules. Unfortunately there were only 3 people working very slow for many dozens of people. We informed the line monitors that our flight was leaving soon and they assured us there was enough time. The same thing happened in the security check line. The line monitors looked at our boarding passes assured us there was enough time to get on our flight, and did not waive us through to the front. So guess what? We were told at the gate that we were unable to board. Go stand in the "transfers" line. After an hour and half in an extremely slow TAP Portugal transfers line (3 employees reworking tickets for about 75 people!) we were given another taxi, hotel and meal. The next day we got to the airport on time and were told of an indefinite delay, because of fog. We were given a 6 euro voucher for a meal and told to come back later. When we went back to the desk they said just wait and there was no information. 2 hours later we asked again and they said the flight had already left! There were other people there who were also very angry. Back to the "transfers" line, only an hour wait this time. Again, only 3 employees taking care of about 75 people, all reworking their tickets. Another taxi, hotel and meal. The next day there was more fog than the day before, and the flight took off dead on time. There is something seriously wrong with TAP Portugal and the passport and security personnel around them. They constantly passed the blame onto passport control, security, the fog, and the passengers. They said nothing of their late take-offs and clearly evident employee contracting problems. Their smiles and so very friendly demeanor does not compensate for the horrible service. It felt like a they were hustling me more than anything.

### "disappointed by the service"
London Heathrow to Lisbon return. Disappointed by the service provided by TAP Portigal. Both flights were delayed by nearly 3 hours and the airline failed to provide updates until the last moment (even though the delay for one flight had occurred at least five hours before). Food on the flight (a dry ham roll) was unpalatable and no vegetarian meal option available.

### "seemed not very well trained"
Lisbon to Porto. They could learn a thing or two from low cost airlines. This was a very short 40min flight so I wasn't expecting much. Boarding times were a bit slow but we did depart and arrive on time. The plane was clean but no inflight entertainment provided and if you wanted to use the TAP app to download your free magazines, you can only if you have a frequent flyer card from TAP, if you use one from Lufthansa as I was (they are both star alliance members), you are out of luck. On the other end, it is nice of them to let me use whatever card I want from a Star Alliance company to have my miles credited. When they served the light snack, a simple pastel de Belém that was when everything came crashing down. Crew was rude, not caring how they served the passengers and almost threw the little cake into the trays, showing no care at all. The pastry was very hard, like uncooked or frozen and it tasted very bad! This is the national pastry! In the end, I talked to the captain and the head of the crew and they were nice and accepted my complaint but the guys actually serving the food did a very poor job, they had a childish like behaviour and seemed not very well trained for the job. I have had far better and caring service from the likes of Ryanair. Seat had an adequate amount of space. Not sure if I will fly with them again, not at least on this route.

### "service onboard was okay"
Wir sind leider mit dem Flug von Lissabon nach Barcelona mit der TAP nicht zufrieden, da es ca 2.30 Studen Verspätung hatte aussedem wurde uns kein Grund für die Verspätung genannt. Der Service an Bord war auch mittelmässig. Kaffe und Tee werden nur mit Nachfrage mit Milch und Zucker serviert. Weitehin hätten wir auch etwas mehr Kulanz mit dem Handgepäck erwartet auf Grund der Verspätung. Wir werden TAP in der Zukunft vermeiden und auch nicht weiter empfehlen. We were very unhappy with TAP Portugal on our flight form Lisbon to Barcelona. There was no explanation concerning the delay of 2.30 hours departing Lisbon. The service onboard was okay, we had to ask for milk and sugar for our coffee and tea as it was not offered during catering on flight. We fly at least 15 to 17 times a year and we were quite disappointed. My suggestion to TAP is to inform the passengers either per e-mail or SMS concerning delays and coach their crew better.

### "doing it like a low cost airline"
Lisbon to Vienna in business class. TAP Portugal now don't even have a curtain to separate business from economy. As soon as you get in on board, it seems you are in full economy flight. Meal was okay, crew very nice, but everyone in business class complained about the lack of curtain. TAP is really doing it like a low cost airline. Shame on you. Even long haul TAP Portugal is horrible.

### "overall experience was dreadful"
Boston to Malaga via Lisbon. The problems started in Boston as the flight was 90 minutes late leaving. Normally, this wouldn't be a huge problem, but we missed our connecting flight from Lisbon to Malaga, after being told by numerous TAP staff that we'd make the flight. We were able to get a later flight to Malaga, 11 hours after we arrived in Lisbon. Worse still was the return flight. The Malaga to Lisbon plane, which was scheduled to depart at around 11am, eventually left at 9pm, so our connecting flight to Boston had left hours earlier. We had to rebook a flight from Malaga to Madrid on Air Europa, spent the night in Madrid, and flew out at 6am on a KLM flight to Amsterdam and then a Delta flight from Amsterdam to Boston. There were some TAP employees who were helpful (especially when it came to rebooking our flights) but the overall experience was dreadful. The entertainment system on the long haul flight was cheap (compared with, say, Delta or Virgin Atlantic). I won't fly TAP again.

### "no sense of how to treat passengers"
London Heathrow to Lisbon. They oversold my flight and arbitrarily decided that my seat wasn't going to be getting on the flight. I paid 700 euros for a flight from London to Portugal, preferring to pay a fee to ensure that I'd get to fly during the holidays. The woman that talked to me had absolutely no sense of how to treat passengers, said that I was having an attitude for questioning what was happening. There was a very kind member of staff that tried to appease the situation, and I am thankful for her, but my opinion of the airline had already derailed with the treatment I received from her coworker.

### "I would recommend TAP"
Dakar to Lisbon then connected to Malaga on 2 December 2016. Booked the one-way trip in coach but they kept sending me the option to bid on an upgrade so I did. Bid the minimum $150 and got it - so it ended up being a blessing with Lounge access at Dakar airport. Flight to leave at 14:40 but that morning I kept checking and the flight was delayed and delayed - as were many flights as Lisbon had bad fog that day. Went to the airport and the ticket agent was friendly but had no idea the inbound flight was delayed and she said my flight was on-time (which I knew would be impossible). But having lounge access made the 3-hour wait bearable as there was food and drink and views of the tarmac. Flight arrived and the insane process for boarding flights in Africa began - pushing and shoving to get on the bus to get to the plane. Once on-board I was impressed by the friendliness of the flight attendants. Very chatty with passengers and apologizing for the delay. Drink orders taken and inflight kit handed out (very cute tin with eye shades, lip balm, socks, etc) which for a 4 hour day flight was impressed. Food was delicious and having Port on the way to Portugal is essential and tasted so good. No inflight entertainment but slept and read their inflight magazine. Landed in Lisbon and even though there were many gates we parked remote and it took forever for the bus to come and then a 15 minute trip just to get to the terminal. I raced to transfers and they were ready for all the delayed passengers - already booked me on the next flight to Malaga on Saturday morning and provided me a hotel for the night. But I wanted to try to see if I could make it to my original flight as it was still 20 minutes before departure. I ran like crazy through the airport and got to the gate and it said closed - and the 2 gate agents were there closing the door and reviewing the boarding passes. I begged for them to open the door but the male agent was so beyond rude - he said "if you were here 30 seconds ago I would let you on". Really horrible - so I told him off and went to the exit and to my hotel. I will say TAP provided a very nice hotel and paid the taxi fare (which US airlines will not do due to weather - but they should and it's why US airlines have such bad reviews). Slept well and on-time and smooth flight to Malaga Saturday noon. New ATR jet and great flight attendants. Bag arrived quickly. Overall I would recommend TAP - had never flown them before and even with the delay they handled it well.

### "staff courteous and supportive"
Lisbon to New York JFK with TAP Portugal. We've flown to over 50 countries and our flight attendant on TAP was one of the most professional we’ve ever come across. He made the 7-hour flight a joy and every encounter with was courteous, supportive and a pleasure. The food and entertainment were better than average, but it was his superior service that made the flight exceptional.

### "I was pleasantly surprised"
I had missed my Swiss connection from ZRH to LIS due to the Swiss flight from BOS to ZRH being delayed. Swiss had booked me on a later flight on TAP Air Portugal to LIS. I had not flown TAP for quite some time and was frankly apprehensive, from negative comments I had heard from friends about this carrier. I was pleasantly surprised when I boarded the clean and fairly refreshed cabin of this A320 aircraft and was greeted by a very cabin crew. We took off from a cold and rainy ZRH on time and I was served a good selection of wines, and a nice hot lunch. The chief Purser gave me a run down on Portuguese wines, selecting for me one of his favorites reds, which was very enjoyable. The flight was smooth and I was able to get some sleep,arriving in Lisbon on time. A bit of a wait for the baggage but was happy to see mine on the baggage belt after being thru checked in BOS with Swiss. A very nice experience with TAP and will do again it again!

### "a smooth uneventful flight"
We had a smooth uneventful flight from Lisbon to LHR. What was surprising was that TAP share a lounge at Lisbon with a large number of airlines. Further, on arrival in Heathrow we were told TAP does not pay for the priority lane so,we spent a long time being processed. Staff were good and food and drink supplied. Probably not worth paying for business class.

### "horrible customer service"
Boston to Valencia via Lisbon. We had a 1h10m transfer time. Our plane landed 20 minutes late in Lisbon. We had another 50 minutes to catch another flight to Valencia. When we told Airport attendant that we have flight to Valencia she sent us to the long line for passport control. It had about 250 people in the line that moved extreamely slow. I knew we will not make it if we stay there I went to information desk and asked another customer service representative how we can go by fast lane, we had about 35 minutes left. The first woman came and sent me to the lane again, she told me don't worry, someone will call us. I did not believe her, and we asked another attendant to help us to of through the passport control faster. Somehow just because I had to run around and did not listen the first woman we got to the gates 20 minutes before the flight. But the man who was there said that gate is closed and they just sent the last bus to the plane. It was 5 people that they left at the airport and did not wait. We asked them to find the transportation for us to the plane but they refused to do so. TAP Portugal does not keep in their mind that missing a plane because no-one could wait 5 minutes people are losing their valuable vacation days, besides that our baggage took another flight and we got our bags in 2 days. Again we missed the plane because of horrible customer service at the airport. How can we have a line of 300 people for the passport control. It would take minimum 2 hours to get to the officer. People at the gate was notified that we just passed the control but they sent the bus having 20 minutes before departure. Tomorrow we have our flight back to Boston and we are scared to be stuck in Lisbon airport again and be late to work.

### "disappointed by the Business service"
Paris Orly to Lisbon with TAP Portugal. Very disappointed by the Business Class service. Ok, it's just the economy seat with the middle one free like on most Europeans carriers but there is no welcome drink, ot even a glass of water. After the average snack served, the crew vanished the whole flight. Despite the priority tags on my luggage they arrived last.

### "ground staff not pleasant"
Marrakech to Geneva via Lisdon with TAP Portugal. Cramped hard seats with little recline. They served soft drinks and a sandwich, which was not bad for the hour and fifty minute flight from RAK to LIS. The flight crew was courteous and appeared competent. Boarding was a bit chaotic but even worse was the ground crew in Lisbon. It took 90-minutes to get through immigration and the immigration officers appeared incompetent. I know this is not airlines fault, but as Lisbon is their main hub, it is a critique of the airline as well. The bus drivers that transported passengers from the plane were even more incompetent. First, they started to pull away as an elderly passenger was just getting in and she fell. Second, when we arrived at the door we waited a few minutes while the bus driver from the bus in front of us chatted with a young woman. Finally, when we were able to get off the bus the driver only opened one door. At least the incompetent driver of the bus in front of us had opened the three doors. TAP is not a pleasant airline to fly, but mainly because of the ground staff.

### "appalling customer service!"
My friend flew from Lisbon to Rio de Janeiro and at Check-in, she was told that the flight was very full and they proposed her to become volunteer for a stand-by for a flight on the next day and a 600 Euro compensation if her stand-by would be necessary. After all the stand by wasn't needed so she was able to take the initially booked flight. But her luggage stayed behind in Lisbon and was only delivered on the next day. She had to pick it up at the airport because they failed to deliver the bags at her home. On top of that, one of the bags was damaged. TAP Portugal sent her a pathetic standard contact-center email one month later telling her that the bags had been delivered. Appalling customer service!

### "offers a very basic product nowadays"
All in all TAP offers a very basic product nowadays but they do offer some great connections to/from Brazil, and flying more or less direct saving substantial time. In my case to Salvador and return from Fortaleza. They also had a good promotion at time of booking. I was positively surprised about the transit in LIS that was uneventful and there are enough outlets ford/beverage wise at for airports reasonable prices. On board the staff were in general unfriendly to rude apart from a few exceptions. On board catering minimal eg AMS-LIS was just a sandwich and drink and from LIS to SSA - 08h15 just one real meal, which was good but no towels/pre dinner or after dinner drinks or in between snack/ice. Just another minuscule sandwich was offered 1 hour before landing. Limited drink options as well. IFE really dated on the A330-200.

### "lack of customer service "
Lisbon to Manchester. If you are flying anywhere out of Lisbon, be aware that there is a Passport Checkpoint just before the gates so even though you go thru security and think you just have to walk to gate, surprise you have a long (for us 45 minute) lineup for a passport check. Nobody came to check what time our flight was departing so we ended up arriving at the Gate 25 minutes before departure and were told Gate was closed very rudely and simply told "Go to customer service to arrange new flight". Turns out you have to go thru passport check again! So another 45 minutes in line. At Customer service we are told we have to purchase a whole new ticket and they will do us a favor and not charge us the "No Show Fee E150". No more flights to Manchester so we book to Heathrow and are assured our luggage has been removed from the flight to Manchester and will be rerouted to Heathrow. We arrive and no luggage. The next day I am on the phone for hours to find out when our luggage will be delived as we had engagement that afternoon and needed our suitcases. Asked about compensation and were told "there is no compensation for you" and that our luggage would arrive that afternoon. It did arrive but not until midnight - I have never experienced such poor customer service and will never fly with this airline again. Their lack of customer service is appaling.

### "customer service non existent"
Funchal to Amsterdam via Lisbon with TAP Portugal. There seems to be a serious issue of punctuality with this airline. It just isn't a priority for them. The aircraft most times look dirty, seat pitch is far from the best, the bread used for the sandwiches is dry and difficult to eat. However cabin crew have improved a lot, now a smile isn't such a rarity. Still some older members of the staff look somehow haughty. Their customer service is non existent so better don't bother. Use their Facebook page instead, they'll usually answer you there. What still made me stick to TAP was their luggage allowance but now their lowest fares only allow hand luggage. They maintain the better terminal 1 at Lisbon airport but I don't know if that is enough.

### "appalling customer service"
My husband and I have never experienced such appalling customer service from an airline company as we did for our flight from Lisbon to Heathrow on 17th October 2016. We arrived at Lisbon airport at 7:15am for our 10:05am flight. We were directed to machines to print out boarding passes and get luggage tags. An employee assisted us with this but there was just one assistant for 3 or 4 machines and very long queues in an extremely busy airport. We were then told to go to the baggage drop and this is where the trouble began. When we arrived, we were told that we were the 4th people on "standby". I said that this could not have been right as we had booked our flights on 7 months earlier (on 1st March 2016). They lady just shrugged her shoulders and told us that this is how TAP Portugal "works" and that the flight was overbooked. She told us that the best thing we could do was to "volunteer" and have "protection" and she proceeded to tell us all about this. It meant that we would be guaranteed on the 7:05pm flight - the two flights to Heathrow in between were also overbooked - and we would be given a meal voucher (12 Euros each to spend in the airport) plus 400 Euros each. She said that if we didn't accept this, we may not get on any flight that day, and, I would imagine, the next day and beyond. We told her that we were not interested in the money nor meal vouchers and that we didn't wish to wait in the airport 12 hours for a flight booked 7 months earlier. She strongly advised us to be "volunteers" - it also meant that, if there were 6 seats over and 4 people were on standby, we would be the ones not allowed to fly. So we agreed to be volunteers - we really had no choice. We were then directed to go to the boarding gate, wait until everyone had boarded and see if there were some last minute cancellations. We did this - it was horrible and we felt like beggars wanting to board the flight. The TAP employees at the gate were cold and lacking in compassion. The flight was 40 minutes late. The flight was full. They then directed us to Transfers, this meant going through border control 3 times. We waited in line for 2 hours. There were over 30 people waiting at one stage. We met many other people experiencing the same situation due to TAP's policy of overbooking. Eventually, we received the new boarding passes, 800 Euros on a Visa card and 24 Euros meal vouchers for our 12 hour delay. A hideous day all up.

### "will never fly TAP again"
Lisbon to Vienna. The flight from Vienna to Lisbon went pretty flawlessly with a tad delay (half an hour.) We got upgraded to business class, which didn't make much difference to be honest. You get slightly bigger seat and stainless-steel cutlery. We flew here with a luggage allowance (23kgs something and the upgrade sort of doubled it.) Over half an hour ago when we dropped off our luggage we were ambushed by the extra charge for it because apparently we had zero baggage allowance for our flight back home. How ridiculous is that!?! Return-tickets with only one-way baggage allowance? Who in the right mind came up with that idea? You either include the allowance for the whole trip or you don't, simple is that! Is this some kind of ploy to rip you off? We paid over €330 for the flight. This is not a cheap air fare if you ask me. We expected convenience, hence we booked direct flights from the beginning. But the hiccup caused by this incident is not acceptable. We can't say we almost missed or flight because, as you may know, they are late. We will never fly TAP again.

### "provided silly excuses"
On my departure date from London to Lisbon, TAP Portugal announced a 1h15min delay. The plane was supposed to take off at 18:45 but in the end we took off around 20:40, ie 40 minutes later than expected without getting any further communication by the airline. On my return trip from Lisbon to London , they initially announced a 10 min delay. Flight was supposed to leave at 16:40. Finally we took off around 17:50, again without getting any communication by the staff members. We had to circle around Heathrow airport around 20 min due to increased traffic and when we finally landed we had to wait for an additional 20min because allegedly there was no parking space for the aircraft. On top of that, I had to deliver my bag before boarding the plane, even though I was travelling "light" because the cabin was full, so had to wait an additional 15 min in the airport for my luggage. Overall experience was very bad. It is normal to have flight delays sometimes but at least you would expect a good and honest communication by the airline. They lied about the duration of the delay both times and contantly provided silly excuses. I would never recommend TAP Portugal.

### "disgusting how I am being treated"
London to Faro. My husband passed away very suddenly four months ago, we had booked flights for three months later. My son contacted TAP Portugal to cancel - to reimburse us they wanted death certificate, marriage certificate which have been sent, but still no refund. Promises to return phone calls not kept by them. It is a very stressful time and I think it is disgusting how I am being treated. I would never fly with them although I have in the past.

### "the first and last time"
Brussels to Lisbon. Frankly, the first and last time with TAP Portugal. The seat pitch was so restrictive that anyone over 6 feet tall was almost unable to sit down. Even the cheapest no frills carriers have more room. TAP can only be described as being financially cynical. The irony was that the price was pretty high!

### "I've had better experiences"
Lisbon to Madrid. Everything average. We flew on an Embraer-190, the seats were wide and comfortable. There was very little in the way of inflight service, just a bottle of juice served at the end - it would be nice to have some water. Crew didn't interact much with passengers at all, although I guess it is to be expected on such a short flight. We were slightly delayed but captain did his best to make up the lost time. The ground staff in Lisbon were a little rude and the lines were chaotic - the check in staff was on the phone when we were directed to the counter and we were made to wait several minutes while she finished. There was a lot of crowding at the counters due to the unclear direction from the staff organizing the queues. Overall, the trip was fine, got the job done getting us from A to B, but I've had better experiences on other discount airlines.

### "the plane was very clean"
Flying TP929 from Zurich to Lisbon. Boarding was to schedule and took very little time. The plane was about 90% full. The cabin crew were friendly and they spoke English well enough to communicate without any problems. The plane was very clean. The food however was not really to my taste. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either. I found the seats to be quite comfortable, there is not much leg room though. Ultimately a rather undistinguished flight, but far from being a bad experience.

### "such poor customer service"
Rome to Boston via Lisbon. Never in my life have I ever experienced such poor customer service! Check in opened late, which led to extremely long chaotic lines. My bags were slightly over weight and was charged an outrageous €190 (work related items that I could not discard). The aircraft boarding process was also chaotic and made our departure late as well. I could go on and on, but I think I made my point here.

### "their product leaves much to be desired"
A return four sector trip to Madeira from London Heathrow via Lisbon. TAP have many good assets such as excellent schedules and well serviced aircraft. But their product leaves much to be desired. One sector served nothing (due to minimum crewing apparently) whilst the crew made toasted sandwiches down the back. Except for the final return segment, crew looked unhappy, wore scruffy uniforms and had little interaction with passengers. Food on three sectors was basic to say the least and tatty old seats with missing ash-trays gave a bad impression. This airline needs to take a long hard look at its service which with the right management could be an excellent product. Living in the legacy 1990s is no sufficient. On the positive sign, the wine in economy class is good and the coffee the best in the air by far. Lisbon transfer lacks signage but TAP are very visible to help out which is a good point too.

### "will only fly TAP if no alternatives"
Lisbon to Milan Malpensa with TAP Portugal. The reservation system is totally useless. First it changed my return date, that I corrected. Secondly the system takes forever to go from page to page. The credit card approval is a nightmare, you cannot check in online. You need to go to the walk in check in at the airport wait in line to get your credit card approved again to finally get your boarding pass that incidentally changes your seat assignment that was choosen online. Why bother to spend the time to choose a seat? I fly every weeks for my work and I will now only fly TAP if I have no other alternatives. I am also enrolled in their Victoria program - also useless! Bottom line, it's not less expensive than Air France or Lufthansa but Easy Jet is cheaper and the service is better. At least if you choose your seat online you know you won't end up between other passengers.

### "experience was utterly annoying"
TP1511 from Lisbon to Accra with TAP Portugal and was extremely disappointed with the business class. More specifically, I was unpleasantly surprised to see that the aircraft was an A320. It is the first time that I have ever been on this type of aircraft for a 5h long flight to Africa. TAP should have mentioned somewhere the type of aircraft which, again, is totally unusual for this kind of flight. I would certainly have chosen another option would I have known. I didn't even have a plug for my computer. If I can't charge my computer in business class, then it's really not a business class. Same thing with the seats, which are really economy class seats. The entire experience was utterly annoying.

### "flight very uncomfortable"
Boston to Nice via Lisbon. I found my flight to be very uncomfortable. Very poor food Boston to Lisbon, and very narrow seats flying across the Atlantic, worst I have ever seen. I am only 6'1" and could not lay back and stretch my legs, seat in front of me prevented this - everything looked cheaply made. Both Atlantic flights had broken magazine pouches. From Lisbon to Nice the snack they served was a small roll with a 1/2 slice or less of turkey with nothing else. No mayo, butter, etc. pathetic I felt as though I was flying on a low budget Atlantic flight! They didn't inform us on the plane that there was a security strike at Lisbon. 2000 souls waiting to get through Customs, and more in security with only 2 lines open! Big nightmare, staff not helpful at all.

### "delays compounded with poor communication"
We suffered delays compounded with poor communication. We travelled Gatwick to Lisbon on 18 August and had delays on departure. No-one said anything to the passengers. On travelling from Lisbon to London Heathrow on 1st September, there was again a delay (we left about 50 minutes late) but there was no explanation from the ground staff. The Captain gave an explanation once we were on board. When we arrived in Heathrow all the passengers had to wait for their luggage for about 50 minutes - without any explanation. In addition, they don't offer any choice of onboard food (or buy onboard) on short haul flights.

### "very happy to have 3 empty seats"
Barcelona to Lisbon. Excellent cabin crew, professional and very helpful. Flight was great and arrived to catch my connecting flight to Faro with plenty of time to shop. Small sandwich provided was fresh and tasty. Cabin crew offered new seats with more leg room to tall passengers before take off and allowed me to move to their seats, so I was very happy to have 3 empty seats for more room as well.

### "very nice and attentive crew"
Flew TAP from Lisbon to Hamburg in Business Class. Lounge in Lisbon was very nice. Great flight with very nice and attentive crew. On this flight they served a breakfast which was quite nice. Inflight entertainment could be better besides the inflight magazine. It was a great flight.

### "a lot of misinformation"
Porto to Nice via Lisbon with TAP Portugal. Flight delayed in the morning from Porto. 3 successive delays. Worried as I could miss my connection. When asked about the connection the desk staff said "don't worry the connection flight will wait for you" (an incredible procedure never heard about before). When I raised doubts about the possibility of getting my connection (1.5 hrs of delay) and requested a new ticket to reach Nice that evening answered "in Porto we cannot issue other tickets, you can do that in Lisbon". Landed in Lisbon the connection flight was missed as expected. Not 1 person from TAP able to provide any kind of explanation or resolution. Moved to transfers. Moved into 3 different queues. About 50 people including children and elderly. No drinks, seats, any other comfort to alleviate the almost 6 hours of queues and waits. Fragmented information and always different every 15 minutes. In the end (around 5 pm local time) I found out I would be rerouted the day after to Paris and then to Nice by Air France (a mandatory choice, no way to negotiate it). Told I have to pick up my luggage in Paris the day after with only 1 hr to connect and having to get a new boarding pass at the Air France desks. Moved to hotel without luggage. Wake-up at 4 am. Moved again to airport. When asked TAP about picking up luggage in Paris the situation changed and no pickup required, luggage will go to Nice directly. When I asked for baggage tags incase of problems I was told "you have to trust TAP". This is my first time with TAP because of its membership to Star Alliance. Never experienced so much trouble for such a short distance. A lot of misinformation that overcomplicated the situation. Never ever again. Really a bad experience.

### "certainly not choose TAP myself"
London to Rio de Janeiro via Lisbon. Outbound first sector on A319 fine. Good meal with well-cooked grouper as a main. Pretty impressive for short haul. Unfortunately this was as good as it got. Discovered that no lounge airside after passport control in Lisbon, so had nearly two hours to wait in main terminal building. Boarding somewhat chaotic - aircraft to Rio an ageing A340. Cabin crew not very welcoming and the leather gloves the females wear make them appear as if they are about to strangle someone rather than provide a service of hospitality. Seat format is 2-2-2. I had chosen a central seat several weeks before in order to have as much sleep as possible and neither disturb a neighbour, nor be disturbed by one. Having settled into my seat, I was staggered when the purser called at me across the aisle to ask if I spoke English, and pressured me to move, asking loudly in front of a couple who wanted to sit together - one of them in my seat. (If somebody had a medical need, it would be a different matter. Similarly if there was a genuine requirement on the part of the operating crew. That was not the case here. They had simply not organised themselves in time.) I was therefore obliged to sit in a seat I did not wish to be in throughout the flight. My fear of being disturbed by the new seating arrangement was realised. A member of the cabin crew leant over me throughout dinner service to serve my neighbour- constantly bashing the side of my seat and speaking extremely loudly over the top of me as I tried to rest. Once the dinner service was over, managed to get some sleep; served a cold breakfast of cold cuts and cheese shortly before landing. Return on a more modern A330. First appearances can be deceptive. Although newer, this is about the least passenger- friendly business class I've flown in for at least five years. The cabin is extremely open, giving virtually no privacy - the screen between neighbours provides no barrier at all. The seat pods are very low, with tv screens at knee height - not comfortable to watch a film. There's nowhere to stow belongings. On an overnight flight this is particularly frustrating. The seat does not fully recline, meaning I spent the entire flight slipping down towards the footwell. At the end of a 10 hour flight there was no hot breakfast - especially poor given many pax will skip dinner on a 2300 take off. The cold meats were OK but one slab of cheese and one chunk of mango is not great catering. IFE was turned off fully 35 minutes before landing. Quite staggering when so many other airlines allow you to watch/listen virtually until the doors are open. And especially frustrating when having selected a film to watch knowing it would finish 20 minutes before landing, and being deprived of the end. Having learnt my lesson on the outbound, went through passport control so I could access the lounge for my 3 hour layover. Discovered it was not run by TAP (no lounge in their own capital city - very poor) and had to pay €15 for a shower. Distinctly unimpressed on a flight costing more than €4000. No hot food in the lounge either. Final sector to London on A319. Mid afternoon so no hot food there. Result - 18 hours in TAP's "care" as a business passenger with only cold cuts and sandwiches on offer. Cabin crew on both return sectors were OK. All sectors on time. Flight was chosen, booked and paid for by a client – would certainly not choose TAP myself.

### "unable to provide with any food"
I travelled to from London Heathrow to New York JFK via Lisbon using TAP on all four flights at the beginning and end of my holiday. Before checking in, TAP provided a function on their website that enabled me to choose a vegetarian meal option for the two long-haul flights from Lisbon to JFK on July 31st and JFK to Lisbon on August 8th. On the first long-haul journey, the flight attendants had no record whatsoever of me choosing a vegetarian meal option despite me being able to produce a screenshot of my selection, and consequently they were unable to provide me with any food on the seven hour flight. Incredibly, I was told it was my fault for not confirming at check-in that I had chosen a vegetarian meal. The flight attendant stressed that on the way back from New York, I should confirm my meal choice when dropping my luggage during check-in. It's worth noting that on the shorter three-hour flight from London Heathrow to Lisbon, there was also no vegetarian food on offer – only a Turkey sandwich. So far I had spent more than nine hours in the air with TAP Portugal without any food. Nine days later, I confirmed my vegetarian meal choice while checking in at JFK, as requested by the rude and unhelpful flight attendant. The man at TAP's check-in desk said he had no record of me choosing a vegetarian meal option online but assured me that TAP would definitely have a vegetarian pasta option on board. Once again, however, the only meal available on this flight was chicken and once again, the only option on TAP's shorter journey from Lisbon to London was a Turkey sandwich. It's completely unacceptable that for all four of my flights with TAP Portugal – a total of 19 hours of flying time – they were unable to provide with any food. I will never use this airline again.

### "delays do not seem unusual on TAP"
Lisbon to Amsterdam. Flew TAP thrice in the past two weeks, thrice was the flight delayed. Two flights were delayed due to technical reasons, one was just half an hour later. This does not seem unusual on TAP flights. Another family member has flown TAP before and his flight was delayed so much he missed his connection to Brazil. We almost missed our connection to the Azores, but unsurprisingly that flight was delayed as well. Overall my family has flown TAP 5 times, and four of those were delayed. This will probably be the last time I fly with TAP. The old planes and the staff manning them didn't add to the experience.

### TAP Portugal customer review
London Heathrow to Lisbon return with TAP Portugal. Outward trip to Lisbon delightful with lots of leg room, on time, friendly staff and good service. Arrived very relaxed. Return trip from Lisbon to London a big surprise. Leg room worse than easyJet or Ryanair. Grumpy (even rude) staff. Inedible "snack" full of "E"s Late leaving. Arrived unhappy.

### "very poor overall"
I flew TAP Portugal with my wife, son, and daughter from Terceira Island to Lisbon. Being a night flight, departing at 20.20, I was expecting a much better meal than the one served. A poor quality sandwich (ham and cream cheese), and juice. Also, the air hostess literally threw the sandwich over the tray, rather than serving them politely. Very poor overall. The flight was over two hours, so a better service should have been provided.

### "worst customer service"
Rome to Boston via Lisbon with TAP Portugal. Worst customer service! Our first TAP flight was a little bit late and there were a dozen passengers that had to get on a connecting flight to Boston which was scheduled to finish boarding near the same time that we landed. TAP made no effort to communicate to the next flight that we were on our way. They took us to a "transfer department" where we were told that there wasn't another flight out for another 24 hours. They didn't try to find me a different flight to another city nearby or on another airline. No compensation for our troubles, very disappointing. Don't waste your money!

### "service was terrible"
I flew on Flight TP228/832 Miami to Rome via Lisbon. The seats were terribly uncomfortable and food was awful. The entertainment was awful with old movies. The service was terrible. no one was available I have a return flight scheduled for August 5 on Flight TP837/829 Rome to Miami which I was finally able to reach TAP in Portugal to cancel. The rep told me the penalty to cancel is $400.00 which I accepted but she could not tell me the amount of my refund and if I wanted to know I would have to wait one month then email TAP. She could not talk to the refund dept or transfer me.

### "food and service are really bad"
Vienna to Lisbon on a very old A330, however quite comfortable long haul seats. Back on a A320 with the usual 3 hour delay. Food and service are really bad, drinks (Portuguese wines) are good. Especially on the way back the crew were chatting and having fun, they did not care about the passengers. No welcome drinks, they provided menus but were out of 1 (of 2!) options with only 3 passengers in business class. Will I fly them again? Certainly not.

### "cabin crew professional"
Relaxed flight from Lisbon to Munich. Cabin crew professional and really nice. Catering almost non existent, however they still offer nice Portuguese wines. Love the old school seats, so comfortable. I always loved TAP and I am happy that they did not change for the worse like most of the European companies.

### "last time I fly TAP"
Second huge delay in a week. Came to Funchal from Geneva a week ago. Connecting flight in Lisbon left 4 hours late, no crew. Landed in Funchal at 3 in the morning instead of 11 pm. Today, return flight to Geneva, technical problem, plane is not leaving, connecting flight in Lisbon is lost. No idea when we will arrive in Geneva. Maybe not today. Last time I fly TAP. Never again.

### "campaign is misleading"
Boston to Lisbon with TAP Portugal. Do not take this airline if you're looking for flat bed business class seats. We got the old angled ones outbound and just checked in for our flight back to Boston and they are angle flat seats again. The PR campaign about flat bed seats is misleading. I'll never fly TAP again. I'll only fly airlines that really have flat bed business class seats like BA, LH and others.

### "perfect experience"
Dusseldorf to Lisbon with TAP Portugal. Had the pleasure to fly for a short holiday to Lisbon in Business Class. Perfect experience. Choice of Lunch (Beef or Pasta), Aperitif and Chocolate. Very nice welcoming crew. On the way back a good breakfast was served. On both flights captain waiting for the guests at the entrance. Seat were very comfortable. Can definately recomend TAP.

### "Never use TAP Portugal"
Never use TAP Portugal. I booked my Manchester to Lisbon flight on 15 January to travel on 24 June and yesterday received an email offering me an upgrade of a different flight and time. So I then spent over 2 hours trying to get through to TAP which I finally did to be told that they had changed the flight times on 20 Jan. The admitted that they had not sent an email - no apology - no explanation. I asked what they were prepared to offer as compensation and was told nothing. I asked what happens about the train tickets which we cannot use and will not get a refund. I was then told to call Claims department the following day. I wonder how long that will take. Having read other reviews goodness only knows what time we will take of as it seems that they rarely run to time.

### "overall a good experience"
Manchester to Lisbon return. First time flyer with TAP and hopefully won't be the last. Efficient boarding, flights on time on both flights. Friendly well presented crew. Comfortable seats, adequate leg room for my 6 ft 2 friend for a 2.5 hour flight. Food provided was a bonus on a short flight, cold but rather tasteless sandwich on flight out but hot chicken on return trip. Tasty red wine too. Only negative was that seats chosen in advance were not provided when checking in online Overall a good experience.

### "brand new and comfortable"
First time using new Air shuttle (TAP Express) between Lisbon and Porto in their new turbo pro ATR 72-600. The check in at Lisbon airport for this service is in a dedicated area and priority security at Lisbon Terminal 1. Took me a total of 10 minutes from Check in to the gate to board. The flight was on time and the aircraft looked brand new and comfortable. We departed 5 minutes late but arrived on time. Very smooth 50 min flight with the young cabin crew staff offering a little fruit juice and water to people. I will totally use it again to travel between Lisbon and Porto.

### "Cabin staff were friendly"
From Berlin to PDL Azores via LIS. Great service on each of the four sectors. All flights on time. Snack and free drink was served, the best meal and drink is usually offered on evening flight - warm meal and free wine. Free check in baggage allowance of 23kg is quite nice. Cabin staff were friendly, communicative and responding to passenger needs. Seats on board TAP A320/319 are comfortable, the bad thing is that the configuration seems a bit crowded, this may be especially annoying on A319 on a longer flight. Loved their portuguese attitude to passengers and attendance. Would deffinitely recommend them and use their service again.

### "had no issues at all"
I would definitely fly again with TAP Portugal, I had no issues at all. Flew from Miami Intl to Paris Orly. They were very organized and friendly. The 2 on-board meals and entertainment were good, especially on my return flight (newer plane with better entertainment features and bigger touch screen, first one a small screen that didn't have a great video/audio quality). After passing Passport Control, the wait time time was minimum, 20 minutes or so, which brings the whole stop to a bit less than 2 hours. I also had a great experience going from Lisbon to Paris Orly, a flight less than 2 hours with a great meal. No lost bags or delayed flights.

### "cabin crew was very helpful"
Flew TAP Portugal to Lisbon from Heathrow. Flight was 20 minute late but the lounge they use in T2 is great and plenty of drinks. The cabin crew was very helpful. Great dinner with a steak and Portuguese red wine. The seats might not be the most modern but they are comfortable for a 2.5h flight! Will choose them again.

### "flights are always late"
Amsterdam to Lisbon. We chose TAP because you don't need to pay for luggage. I used this company many times and flights are always late. This time flight was late 3 hours. Imagine how hard with 1 year old baby to wait so long in the eveving. We supposed to arrive at 9 pm, instead we arrived at 12 pm. Yes they give warm meal, but who cares if everybody is tired and angry. You can see that the staff doesn't care. On our way back flight was on time, but they lost our luggage. Now already for 2 days we are waiting for bag, but no answer. I love Portugal and Portuguese people, but TAP Portugal is terrible.

### "no service at all"
No check-in counter in Faro for C or Gold. Lounge was closed. No service at all between Faro and Lisbon, not even a glass of water, just listening to FA's talking together. Old A330 (ex-Austrian) with loop-style IFE (1990s?) and non-flat beds. Chief purser aggressive. Food was edible. Sparkling wine extremely acidic. I am still wondering why TAP insists in calling all this Business Class.

### "good service for short flight"
Porto to Paris Orly with TAP Portugal. Flight on time, clean, good service for a short flight. In fact nothing to tell because nothing was wrong. I flew a week earlier from Paris Orly to Lisbon on midday flight, and they serve a hot meal.

### "still received no answer"
Lisbon to Zurich with TAP Portugal. First we had to wait over an hour in the airplane, then the flight was canceled and we had to wait half the night at the airport for the next flight. There was not enough food and beverages and the ground staff was rude and gave no information. We claimed the compensation we are entitled to according to, but after filing it three times we still received no answer (over 4 months later). All you get is a website form which does not accept English and you never hear back from TAP. There is also no real way of contacting them, which seems to be their way of getting rid of claims.

### "worst airline I've flown"
Flight out from Manchester to Lisbon with TAP Portugal cancelled, no body even informed us, I just came across it myself. I changed flight 6hrs later, spoke to customer service and got a very unhelpful women, who didn't want to listen, very rude. Also had to pay £22.00 for vegetarian meals for my partner - she got a cheese roll going out and nothing coming back, they said they didn't have one for her, but she had it written down. They then gave her a meatball meal? Worst airline I've flown with.

### "friendly and efficient"
Lisbon to Rome in business class with a very discounted fare found on TAP website. Fast baggage drop at dedicated priority check-in area very near to building entrance, friendly check-in agent. Quick fast track security. Large and confortable ANA lounge used. Rather lengthy wait onboard bus before boarding, I was the only passenger in C class. Staff very courteous, friendly and efficient, was offered a port wine aperitif, then excellent hot meal (from a choice of two), tea and a madeira wine. Seat normally comfortable, was offered pillow and blanket. Good flight info from the captain. Friendly farewell, then a lengthy wait for baggage collection at FCO.

### "pleasant experience for price"
London to Miami via Lisbon. Excellent price for Business Class, 2 day stopover in Lisbon at no extra cost. Food was fantastic, plenty of wine choices (more than BA Club World). Great little amenity kit. Ground transfers went very smoothly at Lisbon, but the business lounge is badly designed. They could get twice as much seating in without it being crowded. Crew were very efficient friendly. Altogether a very pleasant experience for the price, would use again. I understand they are bringing in a couple of new A330s this summer and then replacing with the new A330 neo to use on more US routes.

### "don't charge for checked bag"
Lisbon to London Heathrow. TAP Portugal don't charge you for a checked bag, when easyjet charges extra. The fare was affordable (80 euro) and comes with a meal and the free checked bag. The customer service was excellent.

### "need to rethink the aircraft type"
London Heathrow to Accra Ghana via Lisbon with TAP Portugal. Heathrow to Lisbon, A320 flight delayed by storm Katie. Aircraft was clean, aisle seat was OK and plane was not full. Arrived late at Lisbon, missed connecting flight to Ghana by minutes. TAP arranged hotel and overnight stay which took a long time. Next day connecting flight was on time, so one day lost in Lisbon. Lisbon to Accra in A319 - over 5 hours, no IFE at all in such a small plane. Meal served was fine, cabin crew likewise. Accra to Lisbon on A319 again, take something to read as no IFE. Same cabin crew on return flight who recognised me - pleasant attitude, plane quite full. At least the meal was different! Arrived Lisbon early and we were shunted to Gate 47 by Immigration - new part of the airport and not near the main concourse which meant that about 10 passengers from this flight were sent to an area where the small number of shops etc were not yet open - for 2 hours. Flight Lisbon to Heathrow another A320, flight full, snack served, and arrived on time. TAP need to rethink the aircraft type for a flight over 5 hours long in terms of IFE, otherwise flights were OK apart from storm Katie delaying the departure.

### "legroom which was not enough"
Lisbon to Warsaw with TAP Portugal was generally a pleasant experience. The crew were friendly, flight was on time, and the meal was very good. The only drawback I noticed was the look of the seats which were worn-out and the legroom which was definitely not enough.

### "flight attendants very pleasant"
No significant change on Business Class TAP flights from Brazil to Portugal. Check-in was fast. Boarding as messy as usual: we had to wait everlasting 15 minutes within the finger, previously to boarding, with no A/C, with unacceptable 35C degrees. Flight attendants were very pleasant, and made all efforts to be nice. Unfortunately food is still served in small quantities, and is not nice. An exceptional "Vinho verde" was offered as a drink. No champagne, just an acid Portuguese sparkling wine. No full-flat bed, however confortable. IFE just OK.

### "good seat space"
All flights with TAP Portugal from Amsterdam to São Paulo GRU via Lisbon were OK, left a bit behind schedule, but all arrived before schedule. Online check-in was good, but staff at baggage drop-off at Amsterdam could do better. The staff member was busier arguing with her colleagues about a problem with another passenger than labeling our bags. Aircrafts were OK, good seat space and overall clean. On the flight to GRU we sat in row 27 which is near the emergency exit. Leg space was ok, but sitting near the lavatories was in general not so nice. Food from AMS to LIS was a sandwich and some drinks. From LIS to GRU for dinner the only choice was chicken. For breakfast only cold, hard bread with some cheese and meat (no eggs whatsoever) IFE was enough choices to watch or listen. Staff only showed themselves during takeoff, landing and bringing food. The rest of the time they spend their time talking to each other. At other airlines at least the walk around the aisles offering water. Compared to other European airlines TAP on flights in Europe the are OK. Outside Europe they score below average considering services during the flight. I bought our ticket with a good promotional fare. If it would be the same fare as LH, Swiss, KLM of BA I don't think it's a good offer. In other words, TAP is quite basic. However with a low fare it is a good option.

### "good legroom"
TAP Portugal from Milan Malpensa to Lisbon in an A319. Good legroom and clean aircraft. Staff service average and decent food. Lisbon to Milan Malapensa in an A321 with less legroom than the previous flight, poor food and cabin crew rather annoyed. Lisbon airport has not left me excited. All in all a good flight.

### "wouldn't recommend TAP"
The experience, flying with TAP Portugal was the worst I ever had on any flight I've taken. The seats in the cabin of the A319 and A320s are very small. Service-quality on board is below of what you expect from a Star Alliance Member and the food was terrible. On top of that they only offer beverages once on a 3.5h flight from HAM to LIS and only twice on the long-haul flight to MIA which is unacceptable. The in-flight entertainment was outdated and didn't even feature on demand video. Overall I wouldn't recommend flying TAP Portugal, not even if you get a good deal, which was a mistake I made.

### "seating quite cramped"
First time for me flying with TAP Portugal from Amsterdam to Azores via Lisbon and return. The ticket was very cheap and I found the price/quality ratio very good. Staff on all flights were very friendly and welcoming, excellent english was spoken, a small hot meal was served on the Lisbon - Amsterdam flight, small sandwiches on the other flights, plenty of drinks, free luggage can be checked in. On the downside I found the seating quite cramped. Leather seats which were comfortable enough, but quite thick, so together with only 30 inch pitch, personal space was rather limited. But overall if they have a good deal I wil fly with them again.

### "no delay on the flight"
Porto to Horta via Lisbon with TAP Portugal. Staff was polite, food was okay. The seat is not very comfortable but I didn't expect better from the economy class. The aircraft was clean and not very old and a good price/quality relation. No delay on the flight.

### "great value for money"
Great TAP Portugal flights from Porto to Panama via Lisbon, both arrived before schedual. Food and beverages in the long haul flight were fantastic. Cabin crew attentive and kind. Seats were confortable and relax position was almost a flat bed. Inflight entertainement needs to be upgraded in this aircraft CS-TOE. Very competent and great value for money.

### "incompetent and not helpful"
I have no complaints about the aircraft of TAP Portugal or the flight attendants. However, the ground staff at Lisbon Airport were impolite, incompetent and not at all helpful. I was flying Frankfurt via Lisbon to Rio de Janeiro. We left late in Frankfurt due to problems with the computer systems and nobody seemed to be able to solve it within all the check-in-period. When getting at Lisbon Airport all the passengers with connecting flights to different Brazilian cities had to be put on other flights. My destination actually wasn't Rio but Curitiba, but I (had to) booked it separately. So, TAP said  that they only had the duty to get me to Rio where they had sent my luggage anyway. When they offered me a flight 8 hours later that went via two Brazilian cities in Northeastern Brazil and would only get two days later to Rio, I proposed several times, if they couldnt let me on another plane the next day or even the day after that or, even better, let me fly via Sao Paulo since I really didnt have to get to Rio and would lose my connecting flight to Curitiba anyway. They insisted there were no seats. When I called my travel agency they told me there were free seats only in a more expensive category (I guess in Premium Economy or Business Class). I repeatedly asked for help and directed myself to several employees. Several of them didn't even speak proper English. I was a little nervous since I didn't see myself getting to Brazil on time when my job there started two days later. After nearly two hours had passed, I asked again if there wasn't any other solution they could offer. That was when they indicated me to leave the check-in area and to ask the customer service at the entrance hall of the airport. I did that, explained my problem to one of the ladies working there. She stared at her monitor, clicking several things for about 10 minutes not saying anything. Finally, she looked up and said: We have got it. Your flight leaves in about 45 minutes. It goes to Sao Paulo. From there I booked you a flight to Curitiba. I also have you luggage in Rio sent to Curitiba. Of course, I was incredibly grateful to this lady and very much relieved. (even though in Sao Paulo, I had literally 5 minutes to change flights and almost lost the connecting flight and my luggage got to Curitiba only two days later). But, I still wonder why the ground staff from TAP were not at all cooperative and helpful, when after all there was the option to book a different flight for me, also one that left way earlier and would get me nearly directly to my destination, as I had planned it anyway. The flight had cost ca. 1200 Euros, so I guess, it wasnt so cheap that I couldnt expect at least some nice treatment.

### "very attentive cabin crew"
I had a pleasure to fly TAP Portugal in January on the Warsaw - Lisbon - Warsaw route. The airline has above standard service for European flights. Very attentive cabin crew, good and tasty catering. Great selection of wines. Seating very comfortable and the aircraft was clean on both routes. The check-in both Warsaw and Lisbon airports was a breeze. The only negative comment I have is that they could refresh their airline magazine - torn pages and a bit shabby.

### "ridiculously overpriced"
Hamburg to Accra via Lisbon and Sao Tome with TAP Portugal. Outbound was in Business Class, return in Economy class. All flights and segments in an A320. Old plane. Seat comfort is standard short haul flight seat, which is particularly odd, as all in all you are sitting 10 hours or more in such a plane. Seating has no difference between Business or Economy class (apart from a free middle seat in Business class). Food was excellent in business class, but the seating comfort is unacceptable. The food in Economy class was really bad. Wines are good. All in all, this was ridiculously overpriced.

### "think before flying"
Casablanca to Berlin via Lisbon. Don't be surprised if your seat on TAP Portugal is sold to someone else! I was shocked to hear that I would not board my flight from Casablanca to Lisbon because the plane was full. I had made and confirmed my reservation layover in Lisbon. But my return trip turned out like hell. Not only I was denied boarding, but I lost my connection from Lisbon to Berlin and was charged for one night at hotel because I did not show up. I was given a 200 euros voucher by a TAP agent in Morocco and was told that I just need to hand it to any TAP representative in Berlin to get the compensation. Another surprise: I went all the way to Berlin Schönefeld Airport to redeem the voucher and they refused to take it because there is only luggage handling services. I called the airline directly in Lisbon several times, but in vain. I want everyone to think before flying with this company

### "another awful experience"
Sao Paulo to Heathrow via Lisbon, and another awful experience with TAP Portugal. It started two days before our return flight when we received an email telling us we could check in. We tried to do so but the system asked us to verify passport details for the first passenger. Having done this, it confirmed the details were saved but didn't let us proceed. There was no error message at all but absolutely no means of progressing to do the same for the other passenger and complete the check in. We tried five or six times and then decided it would be best to call. The TAP website is extremely poorly laid out and it is very hard to find usable contact numbers - like many companies these days, they do their level best to avoid having to actually speak to you. But we searched the web and found a number. Eventually someone did answer but told us she couldn't help us and instead directed us to another number, which was either manned by dead people or they were on a very long tea break because it rang incessantly, giving no indication at any stage that we were even in a queue. After a 20 minute wait (calling the UK as we gave up on the local Brazil call centre, and so at a probable cost of at least £1 per minute), the call was answered and after a lengthy explanation as to our problem and an interminable period on hold, the lady confirmed she had amended the system and we could now complete the process! At the airport, a relatively short queue took an age to process as the check in staff seemed to be on a go-slow. Everything was so incredibly inefficient. People were only dropping bags off, everyone having (miraculously) checked themselves in already. The check in staff were at least polite, if not all that friendly. Boarding was chaotic on the Sao Paulo to Lisbon leg. The seats were incredibly uncomfortable and the aircraft like a freezer. This time, my partner did at least get veggie food on both legs, even though the cabin crew on the outbound leg had said veggie food was not available on European flights now without paying extra. But the food was not good. And no spirits on the drinks trolley! No mid flight water service either, as the crew vanished once the evening meal had been served. Lastly, a small point but one that could be easily rectified. When serving coffee and tea, please make sure there is milk - on the outbound flight, I was looked at like I was an alien when I asked for milk in my coffee. And fill the cup to more than a quarter full. If you serve me the drink in a Costa size cup, give me more than a thimble full.

### "your very last option"
Caracas to Barcelona via Lisbon, and TAP Lisbon airport staff is poor. If by chance you have any delay and miss your connection, TAP Lisbon airport staff would not help you at all. They actually only know how to say sorry, and sorry doesn't help to solve any problem you may have. I miss my best friend wedding because their willingness to help doesn't exist - they don't care about the customer and they don't take resposibility of their mistakes (in my case, a 2 hours delay on my first flight). I also realize that the supervisor lie to me telling me there wasn't any flight from another airline so I have to wait 6 hours for the next TAP flight to Barcelona - there was one so I went again to ask them for help but they would do nothing. If you can avoid it leave this terrible airline as your very last option.

### "won't be flying TAP again"
Heathrow to Sao Pailo via Lisbon. Very disappointing experience. Tried to check in online but got a message telling us it would not be possible and to raise this at the airport (not for example offering a telephone number to ring). At the airport, we tried to check in on one of the self service kiosks that most airines unhelpfully force you to use. This too did not work so we asked a member of staff who tried it and also failed, and then directed us to the ticket desk. There, a surly woman who could not have looked more disinterested if she tried, briefly checked out our booking and informed us that our ticket agent (we did not book direct with TAP) had cancelled the original booking because the flight time had changed, but not successfully re-booked us on the earlier flight as we had requested some months before when the flight time change was notified to us. I asked the TAP ticket agent if she could make the change to which she replied no, I would have to ring the ticket agent. This being new year´s day, I was a tad concerned as to whether they would even be open but she flatly refues to help, saying there was nothing she could do. So, I duly called the ticket agent. During a prolonged period on hold, the TAP agent changed her mind and miraculously decided she could re-issue the ticket for us (weirdly), but as it happened, the third party ticket agency did eventually answer and between the two of them they managed to re-issue the ticket. None of this was our fault, although by the way the incredibly rude TAP ticket agent acted, you would think it was. Boarding was chaotic and on board the service was not good. My vegetarian partner was informed that (even though we selected veggie meals when booking) TAP had changed their policy and that you now had to pay up front for ´special´meals, regardless of what had been requested at time of booking. Telepathy not being our forte, we hadn´t realised this, so he went without. We were told by a member of crew who put on a falsely concerned face, that the same would apply on the Lison to Sao Paulo leg, although in fact this turned out to be untrue, thankfully. Leg room was very tight. Food was okay. IFE was very out of date and limited. No mid flight water service. We certainly won´t be flying TAP again unless there is literally no alternative. BA are miles better. TAP may wish to consider training their staff not to be so utterly rude to passengers, especially those who have paid in excess of 700 GBP each for the privilege of flying with them. If TAP opened up their Portugal to Brazil routes to competition from the likes of TAM, things may improve somewhat.

### "got a very good price"
Flew TAP Portugal from Porto to Berlin via Lisbon. First leg on a small E145 operated by Portugalia. The aircraft was rather old but in good shape. From Lisbon to Berlin in an A319. Both flights were on time and arrived ahead the schedule. From Lisbon to Berlin was served a small tasty snack. The crew was good and helpful. Got a very good price for this flights and satisfied with my flight experience.

### "had a good experience"
Bogota to Lisbon via Panama City with TAP Portugal and I had a good experience with them. Check in process was fast and efficient at Bogota. Boarding started on time and flight left on time. The plane made a stop at Panama Tocumen airport, left within 45 mins approximately, after leaving passengers on and off. Inflight entertainment was surprisingly good. The flight resumed on to Lisbon and went without issues. Drinks and food are okay, not the best, but not the worst I've ever had. No problems with luggage or ground staff.

### "disappointed by lax attitude"
My sole reason to book TAP for my flight from Zürich to Campinas, Brazil was that TAP offers flight to the Viracopos airport in the close neighborhood of Campinas. I however experienced two major inconveniences. My return flight from Viracopos to Lisbon on November 17, 2015 was cancelled and I was reassigned to an earlier flight that day from Guarulhos airport to Porto, 115 km away. I filed a complaint per e-mail at TAP, with the request to arrange at least alternative transport, but without any feedback. The change of flights and the increased travel distance made it necessary to cancel several scheduled meetings that day. TAP canceled my seat on the connecting flight from Porto to Zürich on November 18, and rebooked me on their flight from Porto to Zürich on November 19. This would have led to a transfer time in Porto of 28 hours instead of 4 hours. Only under very significant pressure from our side, TAP rebooked me on their codesharing flight from Porto to Zürich on November 18, operated by Swiss, and departing at the original time. I am strongly disappointed by lax attitude at TAP towards their professional commitments and their indifference to the interests of their passengers.

### "low-cost experience"
TAP Portugal from Paris to Sao Paulo via Lisbon. A cheap fare turns out a nightmare. return flight cancelled with instructions sent by email to obtain update on the phone - only a local number was given (and I was on hold forever). Last flight leg ultimately canceled. Sitting in the airport without any information or assistance. Foreseeing this as the process unfolded, I asked if I could be put on another flight (there was one from Air France, it was not full). I was told that TAP Portugal had "a team" working on it. At the end, big scramble at the gate with no apparent rhyme or reason about who was rescheduled. They cannot field a plane, but staff are able to be rude. Other grounded Portuguese passengers told me this is very frequent with TAP Portugal, other flights were also cancelled (engineering problems). Many angry people at the airport. I previously travelled on TAP Portugal, more often for work in domestic flights to Lisbon then Madeira Island, always have issues, delayed flights, lost luggage, poor food, and I have to say, this international flight scheduling/delivery problem coupled with rude ground staff seems to be more frequent than the on-line statistics that I see suggest. My overall rating is a 0 because of staff inability to deal with frustrated customers in a calm and supportive manner. The service onboard in both flights just match the new low-cost experience you got for the money you actually pay.

### "old and dirty airplane"
Paris CDG to Lisbon with TAP Portugal. One hour delay, old and dirty airplane. A mini snack was served with poor selection of drinks, no entertainment or WI-FI on board. Staff OK, polite but working on a dreadful way. Economy class cabin was half empty, plenty of space to stretch.

### "pleasant flight"
Pleasant flight from Gatwick to Porto on a TAP Portugal A319. Flight was 15 minutes late on arrival due to strong head winds. The crew took good care of us. Check in was quick and the lounge in Gatwick quit to relax before flying.

### "everything went smoothly"
Flew Lisbon to Sao Vicente with TAP Portugal. Everything went smoothly at the airport. It was a surprise as it was the rush hour of a weekday morning. Boarding of plane was also well organized with different groups and they really checked that you can't go in with wrong group. There was a minor delay on departure but early arrival. As the flight departure was at about 10 o'clock they didn't offer breakfast after departure but gave lunch before arrival. It was actually good idea as you have had some small breakfast already. Food was little bit better than average European flight meal with frequently repeated drink service.

### "bad low-cost experience"
First and last time with TAP Portugal. Flew from Paris (CDG) to Rio Janeiro (GIG), I found cheap fares to Brasil, around 500 euros for a round trip, but a good deal that turns out a bad low-cost experience. The flight had a connection in Lisbonne, all the flights were delayed, the aircraft are old, food was poor and staff polite but inefficient. IFE a total joke, no WiFi on board. Space comfort in economy class is not great there should be more space. The entertainment program quality was not great it appears to me that mainly only old films are shown in economy class. Check-in staff failed to enter the correct frequent flyer card. The quality of the food on the way to Rio was below anything I have experienced. Young staff were working in a sloppy way, seniors just watching and chatting. You got a very poor service.

### "disappointed with the food"
Lisbon to New York with TAP Portugal. I was very disappointed with the service and food. Food was terrible and there were only a few small bottles of Coca-Cola for full economy class. The entertainment selection of the movies were very old, and the TV monitor too small. The audit controls were not clear with a lot of noise. Crow was pleasant and helpful.

### "flight crew pleasant and professional"
Had a pleasant flight on an Embraer with TAP Portugal. It is about a two hour flight. The seating was tight, but fairly comfortable. The seats are a single seat on one side of the plane and two on the other. No entertainment. The flight crew was pleasant and professional. We were bussed to our plane from the BCN terminal. The flight left on time and arrived a little early. We were served a sandwich type of wrap and a drink service. The cost of the flight was very reasonable.

### "a pleasant quick flight"
We took this prop plane for the one hour from Lisbon to Seville. The flight was flown for TAP Portugal, by PSA Airlines. It was a nice flight, great weather. 2+2 seating with very tight legroom. The crew were pleasant. We were bussed out to the aircraft at the Lisbon airport. There is very little space for carry on luggage, so they gate checked almost everything. We were seated towards the back of the plane and there was very little engine noise. It was such a short flight there was only a quick drink service. It was a pleasant quick flight.

### "seats which are quite old"
Frankfurt to Sao Paulo via Lisbon in business class. First leg with breakfast served, nothing special. On the long haul flight food and beverages were good. Wine was just superb. Finalizing with a nice 10 years old Port wine is not too bad. The amenity kit is the best I have got during my trvavels, also noise cancelling headphones were good. Only thing I need to critisize are the seats which are quite old and not up to date.

### "an A330 with Wifi"
Flight from Sao Paulo to Düsseldorf via Lisbon, the food and beverages were very good. This flight on an A330 with Wifi which worked well. Seat comfort better but still not up to latest technology as it is not a flat bed seat. Very nice and the crew was very quiet. The connecting flight to Düsseldorf was good but without any hot breakfast service. This should be changed. Scrambled eggs or an omelette should be standard in business class.

### "company is a total joke"
I travelled TAP Portugal over a bank holiday weekend, flew on the Friday to return on the Monday beginning of May. No problems with the flight or check in but what was supposed to be a pleasant break has turned into a nightmare. The pilots unknown to me went on strike on the Friday after we flew, we didn't receive any notification this was happening or advised at check in. Came to come home and were allowed to leave bags and check in but never got to fly and we were stranded along with 1000's of others in Lisbon with no way of getting home. I managed to find a hotel and book flights with Air Maroc the following day. I have filled in forms and sent details and after being promised on 21st October that payment had finally been made of 400 euros I waited and phoned to chase it, until being told 2 weeks ago that they had to cancel the euro payment and had now paid in sterling. Today I was advised that this didnt happen and payment was only paid this week! And I am to wait another week for it to be in my account. This 400 euros doesn't cover any of my costs involved or the hotel I had to pay for. This company is a total joke. I feel I should have been advised of what was happening at check in in London and given the option to travel, not just allowed to travel and left stranded - the answer to my question 'what happens now' at the check in in Lisbon was 'nothing, your flight is cancelled and we do nothing'.

### "Seats are really awful "
Flew Amsterdam to Accra via Lisbon return in Business class. But felt like economy class with bad service. Seats are really awful and no comfort at all. No PTV provided, one sector was just an iPad. Food was ok, but if you pay 2000 Euros you expect and should get something way better for Business class. Advice is not to fly with TAP Air Portugal.

### "miscommunication within TAP"
Lyon to Sao Paulo via Lisbon. During check-in at Lyon airport, I was not told about the cancellation flight from Lisbon to SaoPaulo. The ground staff just handed me the boarding passes and was told that I would reach Sao Paulo on time. However, I only noticed about the time printed on my boarding pass was not as the same as scheduled during the boarding. I asked for explanation but they couldn't tell me the reason and I had to inquire once I arrived at Lisbon airport. I was surprised by the inefficiency of the TAP Portugal staff in Lyon that no one took the initiative to call the office in Lisbon to ascertain information. They just passed the responsability to the staff in Lisbon which I thought was very unprofessionnal and furthermore they could have verified my flight time. I only got the information that the flight Lisbon to Sao Paulo had been cancelled and was put to fly for the next 10 hours. Apparently the news of the flight cancellation was communicated before my check in. I blame for the miscommunication within TAP Portugal staff especially the staff at Lyon airport for their attitude and working performance. I am a frequent flyer and was absolutely upset of this incident.

### "Would fly them again"
Flew TAP Portugal from Gatwick to Lisbon. Check in was efficient and flight left more or less on time. Arrived into Lisbon 10 minutes early. Crew were fine. Free snack and drink. Luggage arrived promptly. Cheaper than easy jet when you take checked luggage into account. Would fly them again.

### "recommend to avoid TAP Portugal"
Flew TAP Portugal from Barcelona to Rio de Janeiro and on the way back from Salvador de Bahía, both ways with a stopover in Lisbon. Short haul flights were okay. The problem was both long haul flights, especially from Lisbon to Rio. We flew on an A340 which had relatively new seats and inflight entertainment. 3.5 hours before arriving in Rio we were told that we were not heading to our destination, but had to make an emergency landing in Natal due to a medical emergency. Ok, no problem! If somebody needs to get to a hospital,I totally understand. I was expecting a short stop of about an hour or so. We landed, the ambulance took the ill passenger and after 35 minutes everything was over. But then came the main problem: one of the fuel valves was suddenly stuck and could not be closed and the plane could not be refueled. They kept us inside the aircraft for 5 hours unable to tell us when or if we would be able to continue our journey. It does not sound long, but believe me, it is terrible. After 5 hours we finally were able to fly on for the missing 3 hours of flight. Our journey was supposed to last 9 hours but we ended up being inside the airplane for more than 14 hours. On our way back, from Salvador to Lisbon, we had an A330. The airplane was terribly old, seats unconfortable, the cabin crew rude and unmotivated. My inflight entertainment seat did not work and the cabin crew did not do anything about it. I asked 3 times to please make a reset of my unit, but the only thing I received was a rude answer telling me to make a claim in Lisbon. What a great attitude. When I got up to ask for a glass of water in the middle of the night without anyting to do, the flight attendant made it clear that she was reading her newspaper and that I should come back in 10 to 15 minutes as her colleagues who are resting now would help me. Ok thanks and sorry for not letting you read your newspaper. Another important point is the food served: it is simply inedible. I tasted it but returned the whole tray to the flight attendant as it was absolutely disgusting. I thought I might be a little picky, but when I saw that other passengers where doing the same, I knew the food was simply bad. After all this, I contacted the airline to make the claim for the 5 hour delay on our way to Rio which was originally a medical issue but turned out to be a big technical issue afterwards. I am still waiting for a response and am not expecting to have one soon. I am calling them twice a week to get an update, but they have no answer. My recommendation is to avoid TAP Portugal for long haul flights. The ticket is expensive and the service you get is far better for the same price on other airlines. There are many other alternatives to fly to Brasil.

### "on time and no issues"
LGW-LIS on an 320 in Economy. Flight on time and no issues. Used Web check-in which and was able to select an aisle seat. Bag drop at Gatwick was friendly with no lines. Security at Gatwick as always not the most efficient due to a rather odd way of lining up people once you get to the check to the actual checkpoint, but uneventful otherwise. TAP uses the pay-per-entry Clubrooms Lounge at Gatwick (access for Star Alliance Gold status), which is a nice lounge with restaurant style order system and much better than the Number 1 Lounge previously used by TAP which tends to get extremely crowded. Free checked luggage, free seat selection, plus free drink (including beer and wine) and an edible sandwich on board. Additional drinks were served on request. A very friendly crew, FA’s seem to enjoy serving and present throughout the flight. During the flight I saw one FA sharing her restaurant tips for Lisbon with an English couple and one FA tending to an elderly lady who wasn’t feeling in the back galley. A good European Economy product and in my opinion much better than BA on this route. If your journey starts in the UK and you pay by credit card using the TAP website, there is a good chance you will not be able to use web-check in for the first segment as TAP will want to physically verify the credit card before letting you check-in. This procedure was explained to me after I got a check-in error on a different occasion flying TAP from Gatwick. For practical purposes this means a middle seat in the back of the plane, unless you arrive very, very early at the airport or visit a TP city Office before flying. This has never happened to me so far other than flying TAP out of the UK and is a very irritating policy. So, I definitely will not use TP’s website for any bookings out of the UK.

### "a pleasant flight"
Copenhagen to Lisbon with TAP Portugal on sunday morning 07.15. Departure at time. Seat 6A/6B, seats old and not confortabe. The breakfast was good. Because of bad weather over South France we had a delay of 20 minuts. Overall a pleasant flight and friendly staff. Return to Copenhagen Thursday evening 17.25 with a 10 minute departure delay. Seat 7A/7B. The dinnner was very well. Because of strike at the french aircontrol we had to fly up to the UK and this gave a further delay. Arrival at CPH 22.40.

### "I would not fly TAP again"
We went through Lisbon and as always that catastrophe due to the fullness, luckily we got upgraded to business class. We were left rather disappointed it was a very old cabin looked filthy and the TV screens were tiny and we're not on demand. It was an 8 hour flight. The food was excellent and the choice of dessert was also great. I found the staff never came by to come around for drinks and was also rather unfriendly when asked for simple things lik: could i please have a glass of water? Overall I would not fly TAP again. The ground crew was unorganized, the flight was delayed by 2 hours (we were already on aircraft) and the cabins had a old look and were not updated. IFE was horrible.

### "never fly TAP Portugal again"
Terrible boarding process, no organization at all. Was seated in "business" class row 2, seat A. There was a member of the crew seated in row 1A who had placed her bag lengthwise in the luggage compartment. When I asked her to straighten it out she told me to find another compartment. Great customer service, will never, never fly TAP Portugal again.

### "next time I'll fly budget"
Had a choice of other airlines but the flight times of TAP Portugal flights were better. But what a bad airline. Boarding was adequate but not well organised. Seating is poor with little legroom even for a short haul flight. In flight food? There was a token effort but no vegetarian food on offer. TAP Portugal have the audacity to charge 15 Euro for a veggie option! The company discriminates against anyone who dietary needs. Next time I'll fly budget : it's a step up from the service offered by TAP Portugal.

### "expected from budget long-haul"
Fortaleza to London via Lisbon. Terrible, our TAP Portugal flight was delayed over four hours in Brazil with no explanation or updates. Everyone in the gate was tired and irritable and people ended up banging on the door and screaming at the staff before getting an update. Finally boarded after 80 passengers were told they could not join the flight and would have to fly the next day. The flight itself was uncomfortable and poor entertainment but to be expected from budget long-haul. Missed our connection and had to wait another 5 hours at Lisbon airport. I have yet to have any response from to my communication to complain and request compensation from the airline. Judging by other reviews this is not uncommon!

### "horrible experience of flying"
Booked the TAP Portugal flight for holiday. It was cheaper than easyJet, and I thought it was a bargain - too good to be true. Given it is in Star Alliance I thought it has a standard to uphold. Unfortunately no is the answer and after a horrible experience of flying and encountering with ground crew I totally understand why easyJet is able to charge more. TAP despite the airline hardware the staff is horrible like others feedback. Even for on boarding the four ground grews are unable to organize and make announcements appropriately and the bus organization to the plane was disastrous. I rather fly budget airline or other airlines and  I am in disbelief Star Alliance allowed it to be part of its network.

### TAP Portugal customer review
I flew London to Lisbon with TAP Portugal on 30th September, seat 12C. The crews on are pleasant and helpful. Seat space is a bit cramped on Airbus A319s but the flight is just over two hours so not much problem. As usual I had an inconsiderate 'recliner' seated in front of me but that's nothing to do with the airline. We were served a tasty snack with the choice of drinks etc. The baggage was already starting to arrive on the conveyor by the time I reached it.

### "heavily discounted price"
Seats chosen online were respected and we made a smooth 1 hour tight connection in Lisbon. SSA-LIS on an aging A330, clean and bathrooms in good condition. Seats were not that comfortable but the legroom was generous. Dinner with two options to choose from. Two rounds of drinks and wine offered and food quality was okay. A sandwich served prior to landing. On demand entertainment system was okay. Professional cabin crew with a round of water offered mid flight. LIS-LGW old A320 with leather seats. Offered a sandwich, yoghurt and drinks. A hassle free good experience. Paid heavily discounted price bought 3 months in advance.

### "Excellent value for money"
Online check in open 72 hours before departure. Outward 11.10am departure, early pushback and we arrived 20 minutes early. Very efficient arrivals at Lisbon - 40 minutes after landing I was in my hire car. Onboard the flight a nice sandwich and complimentary drink, including beer and wine. Return depart at 7.30am - boarding via bus on a remote stand. Reasonable breakfast and drinks service. Seat comfort standard, except armrests don't fold back fully. Excellent value for money. Better than low cost airlines and you arrive and depart from Lisbon Terminal 1.

### "business class seat was very old"
Lisbon to Rio de Janeiro with TAP Portugal in Business Class. Smooth check-in at Lisbon business class counter and efficient fast track security. Unfortunately Lisbon airport facility is now managing the TAP Portugal business class lounge and it is a disaster. Food was nearly inedible and drinks are very limited. Boarding was chaotic as usual in Lisbon ie. waiting 10 minutes in a hot airbridge. Onboard the A340, business class seat was very old, but comfortable. Champagne was a terrible sparkling wine and the food was acceptable. Inflight entertainment based on a dozen recent movies was not attractive. Luggage arrived quickly at GIG airport.

### "not for flying with small children"
TAP Portugal is definitely not for flying with small children. Service was unacceptable. I flew to Lisbon with my nearly 5 months old boy and got no help from staff whatsoever. I paid the seat for my little boy, however was expected to keep him on my lap as he wasn't allowed to have his own. It would be great if I could just lay him down, surely we would both be more comfortable. Also women with kids or pregnant got no respect or assistance at the boarding gate in Lisbon, staff are rude and treated us as a load, not a human beings, abd talking down to us. At the end of the day we are paying more, so they should show us respect! Will not fly TAP Portugal again.

### "cabin crew couldn't have cared less"
Lisbon to London with TAP Portugal. Boarding was via a bussing gate and it was soon clear that the majority of passengers had vastly more hand baggage then stipulated by the airline. Gate staff and cabin crew couldn't have cared less and there was much forceful stuffing of bags into already full overhead bins - but the cabin crew were of no help at all. These folks just wanted to finish their day and go home. Flight was uneventful, although the best that could be said for the food and drink was edible.

### "cabin crew was friendly"
Lisbon to London Heathrow with TAP Portugal on 23rd September 2015, my seat number was 17C. The flight was full, left on time and landed at Heathrow 15 minutes early. The check-in agent at Lisbon Airport was exceptionally pleasant and I was checked in swiftly. The cabin crew was friendly and did their job well. The whole experience was efficient from beginning to end.

### "food a full meal, with nice wines"
TAP Portugal from Geneva to Lisbon. Check-in at GVA airport accepted my luggage 8 hours before departure. Smiley and easygoing. As Star Alliance Gold I was allowed to Swiss Senator lounge, better than normal Business Class lounge. However, a very bitter male receptionist denied in a first moment any access, despite that my boarding pass mentioned my Gold status - he admitted he could see it on his screen, and my hand luggage had a Gold tag, but not numbered, he said. He rudely demanded ("please" did not belong to his vocabulary) the original card, and started chatting with his colleague just in front of me. It took me 5 mins to find it,  during which time he went on chatting intensively. Boarding, flight and landing were perfect, food was a full meal, with nice wines. Unfortunately seat was not larger than Economy class, as it was standard seating with the middle left empty.

### "nice crew, good food and beverages"
Both flights with TAP Portugal from Brussels to Lisbon had a delay of 2 hours. During a PA the captain told us this is normal because TAP has been very busy lately and they don't seem to get the aircrafts available on time for every flight. Once airborne the flight went smoothly. Nice crew, good food and beverages service. Inflight entertainment is played on general screens, one for each 3 rows.

### "the service this time was absolutely unacceptable"
Flight TP7236 to Hanover was delayed by almost 6 hours. Thats a long time for a flight within Europe. Beeing a Star Alliance gold member for recent years I must say the service this time was absolutely unacceptable: TAP handled out a 6 Euro Voucher-6 Euros for 6 hours of waiting. TAPs customer care center in LIS is crowded and the agents there are sometimes rude. For the mentioned delay there were so many reasons given: Aircraft had a bird strike. After two hours of waiting another TP staff told me that the plane interior was damaged by passengers arriving from Dakar. The last explanation was the rush hour in LIS. I can't understand why TP was not eligible to take another plane, a so called standby airplane. A delay is normal for TAP. Absolutely not recommended.

### "onboard was a great experience"
A great flight with TAP Portugal from Milan to Bogota via Lisbon and back. Friendly staff at check-in, flights on time. Onboard was a great experience for the food, drinks, and crew. The negative point is the inflight entertainment system.

### "beware of TAP, they can cancel your flight"
Booked the TAP Portugal flight months in advance and paid by United credit card for my wife and me to fly to Oporto from Rome after a cruise on July 16, 2015. Was notified via e-mail on a cruise ship the flight from Rome to Oporto was changed to Milan to Lisbon, Lisbon to Oporto. Called TAP and asked how they were going to get us to Milan and essentially that little detail was our problem. The change in travel was not possible for us so we booked a Swiss Air that worked perfectly. I cancelled the TAP booking and asked for a refund over the phone on the cruise ship. Many phone calls and asking for updates on our refund have yet to produce a refund to my credit card account. Almost 2 months and no positive results. Travelers beware of TAP, they can cancel your flight and keep your money.

### "pilot and/or co-pilot were smoking on board"
London to Lisbon with TAP Portugal. The staff are very friendly and the snack provided was substantial and much appreciated. Seats were comfortable, although this particular plane was beginning to look a bit tired. What brought the whole experience down was that at one point during the flight the pilot and/or co-pilot were smoking on board. This caused a slight smell of cigarette smoke to become noticeable in the cabin. I'm not the only one who picked up on this and I saw many other passengers in my vicinity looking around to see where it came from. The fact that the flight attendants were not alarmed leads me to believe that they knew what was going on up front. On exiting the plane, there was a stale smell of smoke coming from the flight deck.

### "very friendly and caring cabin crew"
Very positive experience flying TAP Portugal from Porto to LGW and back in August. New, clean aircraft both ways, light and fresh cabin. We departed on time from Porto, on the way back TAP was the only airline from LGW that afternoon with less than an our delay. Very friendly and caring cabin crew on both flights.

### "staff were just rude and miserable"
TAP Portugal is the worst airline I have ever flown. The tickets were booked 9 months in advance for a group of nine. But on the return journey at check in we were told one of our group had been switched to standby. At customer service the staff did not even want to know, all she would say when we asked why was that the computer picked it and that's it there's nothing she could do. We were then told to see the staff at the gate, but exactly the same treatment. The staff made you feel that the customer was a necessary inconvenience. The TAP Portugal airport staff were just rude and miserable, the cabin crew were not rude but very miserable and it was plain to see that the crew did not get along.

### "worst experience with an airline"
Me and my boyfriend were flying from Madeira to London yesterday via Lisbon and I can honestly say it was the worst experience I have had with an airline. Our flight plan was supposed to be from Funchal to Lisbon and then Lisbon to Heathrow, taking a total of around 6 hours. But our plane at Funchal was delayed by 2 hours and TAP Portugal changed our flights so that we ended up having to travel for 25 hours! TAP Portugal at Funchal said it was the only way we can get home, no offer to put us back in a hotel for a night until the next flight, they just said it iss the only flight we can take. Until we arrived at Lisbon where we had to wait for a further 6 hours as this plane was also delayed! The people at TAP Portugal here, I spoke to 3 times and was told different things. Firstly, I was told that all of the flights were booked, they then explained that one of us could fly home which is extremely helpful. And then if we wanted to miss our flight to Faro then we can try to get any cancellations with British Airways, it basically felt like they were trying to shrug us off or get rid of us so they can go on with their next inevitable complaint. I understand it was not them that had to travel 25 hours from a place in the EU that should take a maximum of 6 hours, but I was expecting them to be a lot more understanding and helpful, but clearly this was not TAP Portugal motto. The whole experience is completely unacceptable. My holiday was amazing but this whole experience made me not want to use TAP Portugal again!

### "enjoyed ... but far from a perfect flight"
Milan to Porto flight was operated by Portugalia. Boarding was a little disorganised as passengers had to mill about after the boarding pass check, waiting for the bus to be ready. Once onboard the service was friendly and a pleasant small meal and drink were served. This was an old plane which was showing its age. My seat had good legroom but the back felt like it had a rod in the spine, making it quite uncomfortable. The toilet had an unpleasant smell and was rather dark. I enjoyed the experience but it was far from a perfect flight.

### "a surprise"
At Lisbon airport we were informed that the TAP Portugal aircraft had been replaced and the substitute aircraft was smaller so we had been moved to another flight. This meant a 3 hour delay at the airport. We were advised to go to the Customer Service desk and there we would receive compensation (2x250EUR) what was a surprise for us as we hadn't complained. On the way back from Madeira to Budapest we had to change in Lisbon (to a flight operated by Lufthansa) and had to pick up and drop off again our bags, we only had 45 minutes. They put priority tags on our luggage and we managed to board in time.

### "smiley and very caring crew"
Very positive experience flying with TAP Portugal from Lisbon to Manchester on Friday the 28th of August. We departed on time and reached Manchester 20 min ahead of schedule. Lovely lunch served on board with great red wine. Smiley and very caring crew. Very enjoyable flight with TAP.

### "we were positively surprised"
Very good experience this time. Having flown TAP Portugal several times about two years ago, we expected a chaotic check-in at LIS and arrived well in time. However, we were positively surprised by the very efficient check-in at LIS, which hardly took about 20-30 minutes from getting to the airport to passing the security control (and we even had oversized luggage). Flight started on time and arrived even before schedule in VIE. Plane was clean, leg room was what you can expect these days in economy class in Europe. Food was consistent with an afternoon flight. Both on-board and ground staff were very friendly, especially to families with children (like us).

### TAP Portugal customer review
On board crew were nice, but the plane was old and dirty. I tried to book vegetarian meals for 8, but was told that I would have to pay 15 euros each. They said the rules were changed in July, they didn't care that I had purchased my tickets well before July and they had not informed me of any changes. They are happy to provide free alcohol and meat, but not the cheaper vegetarian option.

### TAP Portugal customer review
The reception and service during the flight was kind, the cabin crew members always smiled. The food was great (dinner). The aircraft was clean, flight was fifteen minutes ahead schedule time. Compared to other airlines in EU I should say that they are a little above the standard.

### TAP Portugal customer review
My flight was from Lisbon to Boa Vista, Cape Verde and I was offered an executive seat due to a last minute plane change so I didn't pay the difference which was excellent. In first class we were given free magazines and newspapers, a welcome drink and the amenity kit before the service. The food wasn't the best but the taste was quite good. For a 4 hour flight the service was excellent as well as all the attention given to us all the time (except for the inflight entertainment).

### TAP Portugal customer review
A good experience with TAP. This is the fifth time this year that I am flying with them. A meal, a pre booked seat and 23 kgs baggage allowance is a good deal. Service on board is good and flight attendants are nice. On the way back to London, I was pleasantly surprised. When I had a recommendation/suggestion to the chief cabin, I was given more than attention and a good experience.

Miami to Rome via Lisbon in June 2015 and Venice to Miami via Lisbon in July 2015. TAP did a fantastic job on all legs of our journey. The food was great, flight crew was respectful and competent. The aircraft was clean,  flights were on time. And it is was the least expensive flight available.

### TAP Portugal customer review
I fly up to Lisbon on a near weekly basis generally on  Lufthansa. When there are no seats left I'm force to book with TAP. I'm continuously disappointed and frustrated with TAP, last year I missed my wedding anniversary dinner when I took the mid-afternoon flight home. At Lisbon and with 10 minutes to go before scheduled boarding were suddenly told there was a 6 hour delay! If they'd told us earlier I'd have got another airline and made the dinner. When I wrote a constructive letter to TAP the Costumer service replied saying she was unable to 'communicate' reasons for delays. Second attempt, an automatic reply, until today no one reply on a proper way to my complain. Once again I was forced to fly TAP for the first time in a year and I got a 2 hours delayed flight, this is shocking. Once again why or why are they so dreadfully poor on punctuality! The snack they offered on board was worst since last time. Shocking airline which does not seem to be improving. By the way in 3 years on Lufthansa I have been delayed once for 20 minutes.

I flew to Lisbon on a very old Fokker 100. On the way back the flight was packed, due to limit weight some luggage had to stay in Lisbon. The crew on board was not attentive throughout the flight. Same horrible snacks offered (choice of sweet/salty) and if one asks for both a sweet and salty snack (since they're so small) the crew will refuse to serve you both. Having paid €360 for my ticket I was hoping for a slightly higher value for money which didn't happen. TAP is losing the race, with this company never again.

### TAP Portugal customer review
Lisbon - Rio de Janeiro - Lisbon. Business class seating is old, from late 80‘s. Seats are not angled lie-flat, probably the worst business class offered this days. Old but decent selection of movies although the audio selections weren’t wonderful. Flight Attendants in both directions were very lame. The food was decent but served on a sloppy way, we started with tasty canapés followed by an optional cold chicken plate, the way back was served salmon to start and medium beef as a main, the smash potato was inedible. On both flights a bad attitude but with a smile. We were on the late flight out of Rio de Janeiro so the breakfast in the morning was a huge disappointment, eggs were overcooked, cold milk, no flakes and a rude staff attitude with a smile! Both business class check-ins were quick. The lounge at Rio de Janeiro was decent, food was very good. The only downside was that it was outside of security so we had to make sure to allow enough time after relaxing in the lounge. The lounge at Lisbon was very bad, crowded, limited food and inefficient staff. Both flights delayed with overpriced tickets. TAP Portugal needs to upgrade the service urgently.

FNC-LIS-PRG-BUD-LIS-FNC. TAP privatization seems to have introduced some improvements to the company's general lack of customer service. Cabin crew was very professional, the food served was varied, in reasonable portions and good quality. Flights departed almost on time. I would advise that you check in online and choose your seat at the front of their aircrafts as these ones have larger legroom.

### TAP Portugal customer review
Lisbon - Brussels - Lisbon - TAP planes have started to age, like their crew always absent when someone ask a favor. No services or improvements since late 90‘s. The old A320 still have the same limited seat pitch, bad interiors, mediocre inflight service with poor food (sandwiches). The boarding experience was bad in both ways, cabin crew like to ignore passengers no help with baggage, coats or older passengers, but the smile is always there! No inflight entertainment or WI-FI. Somethings never change with TAP, both flights delayed above one hour. Fortunately already exist better and cheaper options to fly in Brussels and avoid the priced bad TAP experience.

### TAP Portugal customer review
We left Manchester on a F100 operated by Portugalia and found this plane to be very comfortable (shame they stopped building these planes). The flight crew were excellent and friendly to all passengers on a full flight. The snack was basic and drinks were included. The check in at Manchester was a breeze. The return flight on the A320 was about 70% full and left about 20 minutes late. Although the flight crew on this flight were not as friendly, they were still very professional. The meal was surprisingly good for this type of flight with excellent Portuguese red wine included. The check in at Lisbon was very professional. From Manchester to Lisbon we have a choice of either TAP or Ryanair .As far as I am concerned it will be TAP who will get my business as the value for money is a lot better compared to Ryanair

### TAP Portugal customer review
My friends and I were very pleasantly surprised by our trip to Nice, France via Lisbon in June with a return from Paris (Orly) to Newark via Lisbon. The flight from Newark: clean comfortable cabin with more leg room than usual American carriers. Food was good. Movie Selection was good. Flight staff very accomodating. Flight left on time. Lisbon airport clean and modern. Flight from Lisbon to Nice, on an Embraer RJ 145 commuter jet was equally uneventful. From Orly to Newark: Airbus 319 to Lisbon. Flight connection in Lisbon one hour and we made it! Lisbon to EWR on A330. Seats comfortable. Food was good, plane was on time. Staff excellent. Watched 3 movies! The flights were reasonable compared to other major European and North American Airlines. Bottom line I would recommend and travel on TAP again.

### TAP Portugal customer review
Lisbon to Warsaw. LIS airport transfer was lame, crowded lounge, no free wi-fi, and food options resume to plastic fast-food. Once again the same old story with TAP, flight delayed 1:20 minutes due to return flight on time. Cabin crew polite and helpful. This time the food served was decent, but in very small portion. No IFE offered. Overall definitely not a terrible but distinctly mediocre experience, Star Alliance already had better and reliable partners on their circle.

### TAP Portugal customer review
LAD LIS - same A340 refurbished plane, this time crew mostly friendly, passing by several times but cutting on service, meal was worst, drinks could be much better, once again no choice of options given. Acceptable IFE offered. Overall, a more decent experience with a bad value for money. This time we land in LIS slightly delayed (40m).

### TAP Portugal customer review
LIS LAD - Old refurbished Airbus 340, plane was clean but seats very narrow, boarding took a long time caused by cabin crew apathy, they just watch and smile instead of help, decent meal without a choice for the main course, quality of drinks could be much better. No cabin crew passing excepting the meal period. Acceptable IFE offered. Information concerning the flight conditions could be given more often. Landing 1:50 delayed.

### TAP Portugal customer review
TAP are charging shockingly high business class prices on their route from Lisbon to Sao Tome. The flight time via Acra is almost 7 hours and in my ignorance and bearing in mind we paid more than £2000 per seat I thought I would get something approaching reasonable seats and service. TAP are using A320's on the route in European configuration. This means that business has little or no more leg room the only benefit being that the middle row of three is not filled. They maintain that the seats are wider but on both our flights were not. This may be OK for a 2 hour business class route in Europe but not on a long haul flight like this at the prices that are being charged. The service was lacklustre and staff seemed to have little interest, the food was OK but inadequate for such a long flight and I arrived at the end of the SAO-LIS tired, hungry and feeling that I had been badly ripped off. I appreciate that an aircraft the size of an A320 is ideal for this route but there is no reason why TAP cannot invest in re-configuring the aircraft into a more suitable layout. BA for example use the same aircraft on a 5 hours plus run to Beirut yet have proper business class sleep seats at the front of the aircraft. If they really cannot do this then charge a small supplement but do not con passengers into thinking they are getting good comfort and service. This is one of the worst airline experiences in relation to value I have had and frankly would have rather flown Ryanair. From the moment we checked in in Lisbon the approach was lackluster. It just got worse from there.

### TAP Portugal customer review
Operated by Portugalia, two very different stories. On the first leg, nice crew, good tasty sandwich and drink, old but good airplane which was clean, priority boarding with infants respected, all-in-all positive experience and would fly with them again. On the return leg, TAP Portugal's Porto ground staff decided to ruin my day. I am a Star Alliance silver member and should have had no issue with luggage. But for some reason they now told me that my two bags were overweight (30 instead of 23 kg) and that I had to pay 50 EUR each supplement to carry them to BRU, even though I had exactly the same amount of luggage going to OPO, this apparently did not matter. They even told me to go and buy another suitcase, they would be able to accept it free of charge if less than 23kg. Given the fact that I was traveling with three children one of which is a toddler not really an option. But even if, there are no suitcases for sale at OPO so would not have been an option anyway. Talking to the manager did not help either so had to pay. I was told I could complain in BRU but was also told that it would have no effect. That was true because in BRU there was no one even willing to register my complaint. I tried later through the internet but guess what, 3 weeks have passed and still no reply. As for the return flight itself, it was just as good as the one coming into OPO. So a real pity, a nice product but ruined by some ground staff in OPO and some very restrictive rules on luggage. Will fly LH, LX or LG in the future and avoid TP wherever possible.

### TAP Portugal customer review
A340 on TAP is better than the A330, because they have been retrofitted. Five of their A330s are old and very bad on everything. A340 have a nice IFE and a nice seat. A clear decline in food, same heavy portuguese wines, but smiley staff. Nothing to complain if you are used to US airlines, but a long way away from European airlines on transatlantic flights. Once more, the "friends" of cabin staff were invited into business class. Portuguese way of seeing business class.

I took TAP Portugal last summer to go to New-York on an A330. On the flight over to New-York, everything was bad. The food was horrible and there were TVs but we could not choose which movie we wanted to watch. The flight attendants were not at all. However, on the flight back there were personal touch-screen TVs, the food was great and the flight attendants nice.

My transatlantic flight by SATA was late. I still had to go through customs and security again to make my TAP Portugal flight 536 from Lisbon to Berlin. When I got off the SATA flight the board said final call for my TAP Portugal flight and I knew there was no way I could make it. But then a well-dressed TAP Portugal employee called for Berlin customers and put me at the front of the customs and security lines. I ran to the gate and made it!

### TAP Portugal customer review
LIS-GIG in business on A330. Flight left and arrived on time. Plane was in good shape and the crew very friendly good service throughout flight. Seat was comfortable food on board was good. Excellent Portuguese wines (the exception being the sparkling which I did not like). Only negative item was the vintage IFE which consisted of only 4 channels in 2 languages each on which showed various movies in a loop.

TP836 C class LIS-FCO. I was upgraded at gate and experienced an almost normal seating arrangement (2+3 instead of 3+3) therefore not particularly different than in Y class. Congratulations however to the staff extremely polite proactive smiling and efficient. Excellent food: choice between two main dishes food was well presented tasty and in due quantity. Extremely good choice of Portuguese wines including an excellent douro white plus a 10 years old port and madeira.

LIS-GIG. A340 (retrofitted). Easy check-in at special C class ground floor counters in LIS. Easy boarding despite lack of discipline of non C passengers (not TAP fault). Nice and clean seats. Great IFE with a very intelligent selection of video on demand. Very smiley FAs. Food was just inedible. Arrived on time. Priority luggage first to be delivered.

### TAP Portugal customer review
We travelled on TP931 from ZRH to LIS last Thursday. First negative impression came up when we approached the gate: instead of boarding 40 minutes prior to departure (which is quite a long time for ZRH where I fly nearly every two weeks) the boarding started only 15 minutes prior to the scheduled departure time. So instead of spending the time in the Swiss lounge (I am *G) we had to wait 25 minutes before getting access to an old A320 with really outdated seating. The leg space was non-existent (row 14) and even newspapers were old. The aircraft definitively has seen better times. FA's were very impolite and at one moment I was nearly disciplined for moving towards the rear door just to give way for a FA (I was waiting in front of the toilet when one FA came along the alley to the rear of the aircraft). No smiling and no kind words. There was only a small sandwich as meal for a 2.45 hours flight which I think is not adequate. I would expect that with a LCC but not with a Star Alliance member airline. Landing with more than 15 minutes delay in LIS we were rewarded with an apron position instead of a gate position. Of course there was not a single word of excuse from the crew a bad start into the weekend. On the way back we had booked in business class which was a little bit better in terms of seating and definitively better in terms of catering. However on that flight there were at least 15 OpUps into business (maybe less than 10 paid tickets) and we asked ourselves why did we bother to pay for it.

### TAP Portugal customer review
I flew the end of February from Frankfurt to Natal (Brazil). The flight from Lisbon to Natal was delayed for 3 hours with no explanation from the very impolite TAP staff. They rejected to answer and said to wait. Finally the aircraft was changed to a small and unknown Portuguese charter company named White. The plane was an old and heavily used A310 no entertainment and seats were not adjustable. The return two weeks later was again 4 hours delayed and flying back with the same old aircraft. Again staff were very unfriendly and seats were not working. I lost my connection flight and train because of the delay. I cannot recommend this airline and surely will not book any flight with them again.

### TAP Portugal customer review
LIS-AMS on Jan 20 on an Airbus 320 in Business - straight forward morning point to point flight as part of an intercontinental itinerary. Flight was on time (and this is where the good things end) and Business Class was almost empty - Premium Check in at LIS with no lines but refused to check our luggage through to VIE on OS (both airlines are part of Star Alliance) as “they are not allowed to do this unless the connection is on TAP. Although we used two separate tickets this was never an issue before with other major airlines. I guess the agent just did not want to deal with it. As we had a longer layover in AMS it was not a real problem but inconvenient. Boarding was bizarre and the procedure just plain stupid. At first the flight was called for boarding 30 minutes before departure and people are asked to line up starting with pre-boarding for small children and the physically challenged. They were first in line. Then one gate agent goes through the line and tells everybody to stand in one of three new lines (based on class of service and seat number) once this is finished the gate agent starts to board line by line. However you are not allowed to actually board the plane but you have to stand in a new line at the gangway for further 10 minutes before the actual boarding of the plane commences. Basically everybody including families with small children and business class passengers had to stand in three different lines for 30 minutes before they were allowed to board the plane. Never seen such an atrocious boarding procedure before. Once on board service was very lacklustre and limited to the initial meal service and tax free sales. Other than that the female FA was in hiding mode behind the curtain. You could actually see her skipping through various magazines totally unconcerned with serving passengers. Also breakfast was a small plate of cold cuts and sub-par for an almost three hour business class flight. All in all a very disappointing flight especially as previous experiences with TP in Economy have been quite good. TP lounge is Lisbon is nice with good quality offerings both drink- and food wise but tends to get packed during busy times. I could not say that any aspect of the flight was in line with one expects from business class. No drama as TP got us to our destination on time but clearly not recommended as the experience was somewhere between mediocre (on board) and unpleasant (check-in and boarding) Definitely not good enough for business class prices. (Star Alliance Gold).

### TAP Portugal customer review
GIG-OPO-LIS on Jan 18 GIG-OPO on an old Airbus 330-200 OPO-LIS on an A319 both legs in Business Class both flights on time with an easy transfer at OPO FA's were attentive and friendly and showed Portuguese hospitality on board. However the transatlantic flight was on an old Airbus 330-200 with angle flat seats in an old style 2-2-2 configuration that were not really that comfortable for sleeping and a vintage entertainment system from the 80s with bad screens showing a couple of films in a loop with even no way to finding out when a film actually starts. What was surprising was that the cabin actually did not look that old and quite fresh. No idea why TP kept the old style seats and the useless entertainment system when they freshened up the plane. Dinner served out of GIG was nicely presented and ok but not stellar. Canapés Smoked Trout (or two other choices) and soup for starters and Sautéed Seafood with Veggies (or Chicken with Lentils or Brazilian Style Dried Beef or Spinach Lasagne) for mains. Portuguese Wines served were good. However the limited cold breakfast (cold cuts and yoghurt) served before landing after such a long flight was definitely not adequate for Business Class. TP uses the Gol Lounge in GIG. While the lounge was comfortable the offerings available were in line with the discount character of Gol and disappointing. OPO-LIS was just a 30 minutes short hop with water served and actually no service to be expected for such a short flight. Most of the Business Class cabin was occupied by TP staff with paying Business Class passengers seated in middle seats while TP staff has been allocated bulkhead seats aisle seats etc. Just a short hop so tolerable but a weird mind set regarding customer orientation. Transfer and EU immigration in OPO fast and easy and shared lounge used by TP in OPO comfortable and nice. All in all a discount Business Class experience but not an unpleasant flight and on-time arrival. However flight to Brazil with LX was a much better experience. TP needs to retire or update these old planes to offer a really competitive transatlantic product. If available at a substantial discount I would not rule TP out for another long haul flight again. (Star Alliance Gold).

### TAP Portugal customer review
I flew from Lisbon to Paris (Orly) and back. The Planes were Airbus 319. Leg space could be better. I found the staff neat friendly and professional. They greeted us with a smile and a salute. It has improved since the last time I flew with TAP. On the first trip the board meal was a simple turkey or chicken ham sandwich rather plain. On the way back I had a delicious tuna sandwich. One of the best I ate on board. Both flights departed on schedule we even arrived earlier at Lisbon. Actually I was going to try AirTransavia for the first time but they changed my 9 am flight to 6.45 pm without much justification (which would make me completely waste my 1st day) so it cost me 35 Euros more but gave me a free meal free luggage and free cabin luggage. If we buy in advance TAP is only slightly more costly than low cost airlines but includes much more for what we pay.

### TAP Portugal customer review
I was sceptical about flying with TAP Portugal due to all the negative feedback and only few positive reviews but I still went ahead and flew with them. My flight 15th to the 23th Feb was LGW to LIS LIS to LHR the outbound flight was ok smooth flight departed on time the boarding process was fairly quick! The aircraft looked refreshed - it was Airbus A320-200 the leather seats where comfortable considering this flight was 2 hours. Food was basic just a sandwich with typical fillings - tomato cheese and lettuce. Flying back same aircraft we were 10 minutes late due to late pax arriving at the gate but we landed on time back in Heathrow. Considering Paying less than £100 and getting food and drink included and 23kg luggage limit and having a pleasant flight with TAP Portugal I will fly with them again in the future.

LHR-LIS return. After flying with them last month I did again book to go to Lisbon. Again I was not disappointed with the service. Going out flight was on time and while there was some confusion with the hand luggage allowed the flight went smoothly and excellent service. Got a special meal and happy with friendly and attentive crew. Returning to London flight was also on time although I really dislike boarding a plane via the bus and this is something TAP needs to change. Normally we board via the arm but there was a Rio de Janeiro flight boarding in that gate so I guess those flights have priority. Again cabin crew was attentive and friendly. I am surprised with comments here as TAP provides a very good service in Europe taking into account the current service on other airlines such as Ryanair and easyjet. Have already booked with them for May.

### TAP Portugal customer review
GIG-LIS A330-200. Old model. No smile at check-in. He same extremely poor lounge (GOL airlines) unacceptable and now under renovation was a lot of works' noise. As one of the 5 old A330 that TAP refuses to upgrade IFE was poorer than any other airline in Europe. Not on demand at all. Of course no Wi-fi etc.. Plus the uncomfortable beds. A pity. Good news: wine list has been improved. TAP is selling Business class tickets between Brazil and Europe but has 5 old aircraft's (Ex- SWISS) and do not invests in renovating them. It is then a pure gamble for passengers.

I've flown from Milan Malpensa to Lisbon and back three days later. First experience with TAP and I would fly them again. Both flights arrived on time return even ahead of schedule on the A321 seat comfort was not so good while on the A319 quite good. Service and food good for a European flight.

FNC-LIS. A rather young cabin crew and maybe due to that or not it was the first time since the nineties that I found TAP actually caring for their passengers.

### TAP Portugal customer review
Flew TAP several times very rare to be on time. Flew with my family on 24 October 14. The flight was late no reason given when we arrived in Lisbon our car hire company could not be contacted. As we had two young children with us we took a taxi to our destination. Cost us 135 euros. The main problem that I had was the staff at the gate were very rude and off hand. They changed my seat telling me that someone had my seat despite the fact I had booked in on line two days prior to flying. When I got on the plane someone was sitting in the seat I had then been allocated. The steward made me go to the back of the plane while he sorted it out. I was then two rows in front of my family at no time was an apology made in fact I was made to feel it was my fault. When I got up during the flight to use the toilet I stood talking to my family there were several people standing up the same steward came up and demanded I sat down. He was very rude throughout the flight. Not sure if they have heard about customer service. On the plus side our return flight was on time and the staff that time were very good. I did email customer service when I got back in November but had no acknowledgement or apology. Fly often to Lisbon but am getting very fed up with Tap and if it happens again will not fly with them again.

### TAP Portugal customer review
Lisbon-Warsaw Business Class. Flight surprisingly on time which doesn't happen too often out of Lisbon Airport. Airbus A319. Seats were made of leather but hard old-fashioned and uncomfortable with quite limited legroom. Boarding was quick however cabin crew was not too interested with taking jackets and coats off the passengers. Smart and interesting safety demo. After take off absolutely nothing happened for 1 hr 27 minutes when crew decided to start their service! Not a welcome drink before take off not any drinks or even hot towels for almost 90 minutes. We had to go to the galley and ask for glass of water in business class while crew was having their food. This is something I never understand with TAP waiting sometimes up to two hours to start the service. Why? They did go through the cabin with duty free card but food and drinks were still not served. Finally menu arrived followed by meal which was nice and tasty except horrible pudding. Later crew disappeared for another 1.5 hrs. Overall flight on time food was tasty but service was below any expectations especially waiting for almost 1.5 hr for even glass of water in Business Class!

LHR-LIS return - I haven't been home for a while (Portugal) and I now fly a lot more due to the cheap fares. I haven't flown TAP in a year but I was again pleasantly surprised for the excellent service. The bad reviews here did not put me off booking with them. I am a gluten intolerant and I have the possibility of requesting a GF upfront for free and was very happy with this. Flight out of London on time with nice and friendly cabin crew. Flight was smooth with plenty of food and drink. On the way back from Lisbon boarding was quick and again flight was on time and with a nice cabin crew. I don't agree with most of the reviews here - excellent service pre booked seat 23 kg for free and free food? This is one of the best deals around in Europe! Thumbs up for TAP - Keep it up!

Fly TAP regularly from Manchester to Faro via Lisbon. I really like them friendly crews food and drink (even in economy) included in ticket price comfortable seating with good leg room and free luggage allowance. What's not to like.

Business Class from Funchal to Lisbon and Lisbon to London Heathrow - we were pleasantly surprised at the efficiency of all the staff both at the airport and on board TAP airline. The only thing that lets it down is the service in the business lounge both in Funchal and Lisbon airport - the passengers had to get on a bus to get to the plane. Service on the plane was great food was good and drinks were plentiful. There were no delays and we arrived at LHR with our luggage on the carousel waiting for us.

### TAP Portugal customer review
Flew business from Lisbon to Recife return. On the way to Brazil we flew on the old A330 which wasn't too bad apart from the IFE which were very outdated and you had to basically follow the films on each channel as you could not pause them and there was a poor selection of films. The seats on the old A330 were quite good taking into consideration the aircraft's age - the only downside of the seats was that they didn't convert into flat- beds. On the way back to Lisbon we flew on one of the recently acquired A330's which had an upgraded IFE touchscreen and basically the same entertainment system of all other European airlines except from the fact that there were no options to watch the external camera - which for me isn't too much of a problem; the selection of films was quite good this time. Couldn't see too much of a difference from the old seats on the recent aircraft apart from a more modern design and the fact that it had a massage function and reclined 180 degrees but nothing compared to the seats on other airlines. Staff were quite friendly and always present (they would show up in less than one minute after pressing the button) - far too different than in economy. The food was indeed very good with a good selection of wines and main courses. On the way back from Brazil they served typical Brazilian dishes though breakfast was too simple for business class. The lounge in Lisbon is very good though avoidable on peak hours; the lounge in Recife is a joke: terrible! Overall experience with TAP business on long haul flights: quite good and not pricey which makes it worth it.

ORY-FNC via Lisbon. TAP provides a quite decent service on these routes at very competitive prices: free baggage on-time flights leather seats hot meal on international flights and a good choice of drinks free with good wines. Crew are of different moods: some do just their job but are polite and some are very attentive. The crews' uniform is very elegant and most of them are very smart. A nice thing to know: a large number of TAP agents and crew speak French some of them very fluently and are happy to speak it (not like in Swiss ! ). All check-and boarding in Portugal were made in French. It's a nice and professional touch.

A salmon flatbread and drinks including beer and wine were served. FA's were present in the cabin throughout the flight and additional drinks were served on request. Bag out in LIS within minutes after arriving at the belt. Excellent product by TP with food drinks allocated seats and checked luggage included in the ticket price. Fare was also very competitive. Below GBP 60.- a one-way including ridiculous UK departure taxes. Unfortunately TP uses a bus gate for this flight at both Gatwick and Portela but that just a very minor inconvenience. The only negative was that TP uses a pay-per-entry lounge (No. 1 Lounge) for its frequent travelers. The lounge was hopelessly overcrowded. As I did not find a half comfortable space to sit I left again. It was much more comfortable to just wait for the flight in the general departure hall. (Star Alliance Gold).

Flight TP 62 16 Nov 2014 Rio de Janeiro-Porto Business Class Airbus 330. Very mediocre airline and service. Main comments: Plane: The plane was from beginning of the 90s! As a result of the age the seats and toilets were old and run-down. I had to change seat (the same goes for my neighbor) because the screens were dead. Staff: better than economy (were they are completely demotivated and even rude) but depends on each of the flight attendants. Some were professional and caring many others were just careless and depressive. Food: better than economy but still very mediocre and even sad. The wines from Porto and Alentejo were not bad.

Flight TP 75 Lisboa-Rio de Janeiro Airbus 340 Economy class 8 Nov 2014. The flight left with 1hr delay (ok this can happen to any airline depending on many factors). The plane was far from being new but still acceptable. The worst of the trip was the following: Staff: the most rude team I've ever seen and I'm a frequent traveler. They never smiled worked liked forced to do so unpleasant not caring about anything and even careless regarding physical appearance and uniform. Food: cheap basic rice with bad meat bad presentation. TAP is usually cheaper than other airlines but get ready to receive a bad/mediocre service! Hopefully they manage to privatize it after several attempts and they become more professional.

Flight Porto-Brussels 17 Nov 2014 Business Class (origin from Rio de Janeiro) Fokker 100 operated by Portugalia. The plane was at least 30 year old it should be in a museum and not flying anymore. Everything was old run-down and depressing. However to be fair the staff was particularly nice smiling caring and professional (usually not the case with TAP where staff are usually demotivated careless if not rude).

Flew with TAP on Jul 31 ZAG-LIS flight was delayed 40 min captain apologised and explained the reason. Aircraft was very nice clean and seats were comfortable. Dinner served was delicious considering it is a flight over Europe I never expect much from those meals. On a return journey due to crew strike we flew with White Airways also very smooth and pleasant flight. Will use TAP again.

BCN-LIS-SSA and SSA-LIS-MXP. Flights were mostly on time save one sector (LIS-MXP). Onwards daylight flight to Brazil was not too crowded so was quite comfortable. Food was very good. Staff were friendly. Return night flight from Brazil to Lisbon was full and therefore very cramped. Seats are not that comfortable. Air con was kept too high during the whole return flight. Food was okay. Lisbon to Milan was delayed.

A very smooth and competent trip from Lisbon to London Gatwick. Nice to have bigger seats than Easyjet and a free sandwich/drink too!

### TAP Portugal customer review
I love Portugal and I wish I could provide a glowing report on TAP but they are going to have to up their game to survive. I travel a lot to Portugal as I have a house there - maybe 6 times per year. Most recent trip from London to Lisbon was delayed by 2.5 hours for a reason that was unclear and when I got on the plane I was redirected to seat 35A - which is the very back in the corner seat backing the loos. The seat I had chosen online was broken and could not be used. According to the official at Heathrow the TAP flight is delayed every night. I will fly BA or Easyjet in future even if it means an extra £50 or so return. Pity though the wine is good!

### TAP Portugal customer review
Travelled from Faro to Barcelona via Lisbon. Went to check in 2.5 hours prior and the flight to Lisbon was ok then the agent advised us our flight fro. Lisbon to Barcelona was overbooked and we were given standby boarding passes. We may get on our flight and we may not despite having confirmed seats 6 months ago! Our flight ex Faro was delayed so we missed the connection by 5 minutes. Went to the transfer desk where we were advised that 'we missed the flight' and the first available flight with seats was at 8pm. I understand that delays occur and missed connections but what peeves me most is that we had confirmed seats on the flight from Lisbon to Barcelona and checked in 5 hours before departure and from a connecting flight and yet we get bumped because TAP have a high 'overbooking profile' on their flights. Not happy as we have had to cancel dinner in Barcelona with friends as this is the reason why we were transiting there for 1 night on the way to Dubai.

### TAP Portugal customer review
Flown with TAP twice in the last year LHR-LIS-LHR for xmas/new year and LGW-OPO-LGW in the summer. Arrived early at LHR with very long queues for check in at the old and tired T1 a delayed Funchal flight was causing chaos with the staff not knowing quite what was going on. I was told to use the "self service" check in machine which involved printing baggage tags but with no bag drop area I had to join the back of the queue anyway! Hopefully the move to T2 will resolve these issues. Process much smoother at LIS and very comfortable which is expected. No issues at all at LGW but a 1.5 hour delay at OPO left me twiddling my thumbs for a very long time (a nice airport but rather barren). Service and comfort on board (A320 Economy) both trips was fine although the food was fairly poor (small dry roll and fruit juice). Good selection of wine/beer but only one offering in ~2.5 hours. I will try BA for my next trip which is really the only other alternative on these routes.

### TAP Portugal customer review
We have used TAP many times over the years to fly from London to Brazil via Lisbon. In June we made such a trip. On arriving at Lisbon from London Gatwick we were informed by TAP that the Lisbon - Recife flight was cancelled. No proper explanation Was given. We were stuck in Lisbon for (at least the night). Our flight from Lisbon to Recife eventually left the following morning (over 12 hours late). We effectively lost a day of our trip to Brazil. Return journey - having queued at Recife airport for more than 2 hours I was informed that my return flight to Lisbon was to be delayed by around 7 hours (it should have taken off at 11pm on the Friday evening - instead it was not going to take off before 6am the following morning). This meant that I would miss my connection from Lisbon which was on a Saturday at lunchtime. TAP's representatives told me they could not guarantee an alternative flight to London until the following Tuesday! TAP's eventual "solution" to the problem was to put me on a flight to RIO the following morning. I would then have to wait in Rio for 10 hours before taking a flight to London (Heathrow instead of Gatwick where I was supposed to arrive). I eventually arrived in London (at the wrong airport) a full day late. In my opinion appalling customer service. I do not recommend that you fly with TAP.

### TAP Portugal customer review
Having read several unfavorable reviews on TAP I could not - honestly - recognize what was the problem. I flew CPH-LIS-Faro and return. CPH-LIS-CPH were all on time even a little behind schedule on the return flight. Effective check in and service onboard excellent. You were served a full hot meal breakfast to LIS was especially delicious. The internal flights with no service but it was just a 40 minutes flight so it was not expected. Slight delays on 5-10 minutes created absolutely no problems. All in all TAP is superior to other carriers from Denmark to Iberian peninsular far better than both SAS and Iberia where you have to pay for meals with poorer quality than on TAP. Some years ago I flew TAP to Brazil where service was below what you get from other airlines especially concerning IFE. this seems now to have improved and I will gladly fly TAP again.

### TAP Portugal customer review
Berlin - Lisbon - Sal Island in Business Class. Excellent food very attentive and friendly service good wines. Only thing to know - TAP serves medium haul destinations (Cape Verde Senegal Sao Tome Ghana Mali etc) with an A320 or similar without real business class seats. Seat pitch is a strange 2-3 configuration on the right side of the plane not even with a free middle seat. It gets cozy if its full and apart from nice service and good food there is not that much of a difference to Economy.

### TAP Portugal customer review
Sao Vicente - Lisbon - Berlin in Economy. Flights delayed an hour or so like usual on TAP. And a lot of fellow passengers missed connections. But for me flights were quite ok. Good food nice wine friendly service. If you fly TAP regularly you try avoid short connections but rather plan some time to enjoy Lisbon.

### TAP Portugal customer review
FAO-LIS-VEN-LIS-FAO. First 3 legs on time in A320/319/320 and all in good condition and clean with friendly smart crews and good information from flight-deck. Annoying childish safety video. No food FAO-LIS because only 20 minutes flight-time (scheduled 45 minutes ! ). LIS-VEN poor meal of yoghurt dry bread with small ham/cheese filling dry croissant with apricot jam (no butter) coffee. VEN-LIS allocated club seat with economy service and food actually excellent duck pie followed by fresh pineapple and served with good red wine and water. Bad point was poor scheduling meaning 7 hour layover for feeder flight to FAO which was further delayed by 45 minutes due to assigned aircraft going tech. Would I fly TAP again? Certainly for short haul.

First time I used TAP Portugal and after what I have been through will not stop advising friends not to use this airline. Flight Vienna to Lisbon Wed 25 Sep 2014 - delay of over 4hrs; missed meeting; Friday 26 Sep Lisbon to Vienna once again a delay which caused me and other passengers to miss connecting flight to Malta. Had to stay overnight and take two flights back. What a hassle. Alerted crew - reply "not our problem.

### TAP Portugal customer review
This airline is a constant disappointment. I've have flown LHR to Fortaleza and back from Recife this month with TAP in business class. Return home flight out of Brazil delayed 8 hours - from 2300 to 0700 next day. This is the second time TAP have cancelled and rebooked me on another flight the following day - I now have an extra layover in two cites - Recife and Lisbon making my return over 24 hours late. At no time did the airline contact me despite having emails and cell numbers. I have made several calls to get some answers on my rebooking. In the past month two colleagues who have also been in Brazil for work have been delayed on way home by 24 hours on both these routes given appalling hotels as an alternative and little compensation. One even lost their luggage for 48 hours. In future all three of us will take the longer BA route from London via São Paulo despite this being further at least it's reliable for business.

Denied boarding on TP322 21st Sept Lisbon to Manchester - overbooked. Ok but then spent over 4 hours trying to recover bags and rebook with the worst bunch of staff and processes I could imagine. Numerous other minor niggles followed including trying to buy breakfast at 6 am with 6 euros!

### TAP Portugal customer review
I am always surprised to see some comments. Passengers don't bother to look for things and then blame the airline! The Lisbon TAP lounge is before passport control so if you are connecting in Lisbon all you need is trying to find it! As a frequent flyer I always try and find things. It is not that difficult. Anyway I have flown them on several occasions and in short haul they are the almost only ones serving food and wine in economy! I don't think any Spanish carrier does that Air France gives you cookies or a croissant only! Just took TAP again on a Dakar- Brussels via Lisbon and trip was good.

### TAP Portugal customer review
Terrible airline. Flew business in and out of Lisbon from Germany. Seats were crammed 3 abreast each side and nowhere to put carry-on had to hold it in my lap. No legroom. A thin curtain behind me to economy where the seats were not much different. Staff was rude. Planes predictably late. Crowded buses to and from plane. Long walks in the airport from the gate to the bus. Poor food. Worse than economy on most airlines. Never again with TAP.

TP706 to Prague arrived with only a slight delay. Efficient flight crew and the hot meal was pretty tasty for airline standards. The return flight TP707 was another history with a cancellation and change to TP2795 departing 6 hours and operated by Freebird Airlines. I can't really complain because TAP tried to keep me in the loop by email with the changes and we received 300 koruna vouchers for meals. If you fly TAP be sure to triple check your email to avoid nasty surprises. The Freebird aircrew was professional and the plane was in good condition.

Dusseldorf to Lisbon in Economy Class. Flight on time. A hot meal was served (I'm talking about Economy Class!) and it was actually tasty!

### TAP Portugal customer review
We took a TAP flight back in June from EWR to LIS. The airline called at 9am to let us know (without reason) that our scheduled 7pm flight would be delayed about 5 hours - that is 10 hours before scheduled flight time! Could they not have re-routed another plane? The flight was actually delayed 7 hours. Additionally we were traveling with 1 baby and a 2 year old. They seated our 2 year old in a different row from us and made no effort to change seating so we could be together. We had to ask other passengers to switch seats so that we could sit together as a family. We also brought our car seat with us and none of the staff had the correct knowledge of what the proper handling regulations were for the seat - we were told different things by the customer service rep the check-in agent and the flight attendants. Who is training their staff? Post-flight I was told that our delay does not merit compensation because the flight was delayed due to technical difficulties. It seems from recent posts everywhere that this continues to be a problem.

### TAP Portugal customer review
Lisbon - Fortaleza - Lisbon - Over the past few weeks TAP have cancelled hundreds of flights apparently TAP are having serious operational problems. In five flights operated by TAP Portugal I had problems in all. The flight to Fortaleza was delayed 5 hours no explanations or apologies. Poor staff on board lack of attention to their clients always running and hiding from customers a glass of water takes 20min to arrive after the second request bathroom was extremely dirty I complained but nothing was done the meal was dry and cold no breakfast served. Inflight entertainment dates from last century with a poor selection of titles. The way back to Lisbon was a scandal! Whiteout any warning TAP force us to flight on a extremely old Ukrainian Airplane. TAP Portugal force us to accept this flight.

### TAP Portugal customer review
To be honest I flew with them 3-4 years ago and I don't remember having any issues. But this time I made the mistake not to check online reviews before booking a surprisingly cheap flight. Never again! I have to agree with previous reviews: atrocious customer service. The desk and cabin personnel are either given instructions or trained to mistreat customers. On 30th August the situation in Lisbon airport throughout the whole day (yes a 1.5 hours connection that turned into a 13 hours wait) where: over two thirds of TAP flights were delayed (ranging from 1 to 6 hours with delays going up and down all the time). The line at the transfers desk (Lisbon their base where they should have no shortage of personnel) was always over 1.5 hours and 2 or 4 times more at times. You first miss your connections because of TAP flight delays and then miss your next chances to get to your destination while lining up! Staff randomly leave the desk and disappear running away from the mess and the angry crowd.

### TAP Portugal customer review
We booked a flight from ZRH to LIS and on to Fortaleza Brazil. The flight from ZRH to LIS was ok. This very poor and nearly non-existent rating is mentioned for Windrose (a Ukrainian company working with TAP). I have no words for describing this very bad flight. To be honest if the flight back from Fortaleza to Lisbon two weeks later had not been very good (we were sitting in a new airplane with TV-Entertainment good service and enough space for your legs) I would never fly TAP again. The aircraft (Windrose) was an old A330. It had no entertainment system. Many seats were broken and people had to change place in a mostly full airplane. The Windrose crew were not very friendly and seemed to be very stressed. I felt quite sorry for them and they should not be blamed for anything. The service was bad and very poor. The service for drinks was just twice on a 7-hours flight. This is a real disgrace for the TAP company selling such a bad product and we felt quite betrayed. Hopefully this will not happen again!

### TAP Portugal customer review
Lisbon to Recife July 25th. My seat was broken: one could just lift it up including the belt so it was a safety risk. There was also a piece of metal that stuck out making sitting unbearable. The stewardess did not care and said the plane was full. I was not allowed to leave the plane. The service was non-existent with the stewardess appearing just twice giving out an awful meal. During the 8.5 hour flight drinks were only served with the meals. One could not even get water.

### TAP Portugal customer review
I flew LHR-LIS for a 9 day holidays. The flight was delayed by 3 hours due to severe weather. Instead of keeping us in the lounge they kept us on the plane for 2 hours. Cabin crew had no interest in explaining us the passengers that due to unforeseen circumstances the flight would be delayed. They simply sat and chatted amongst themselves. I'm ok with that. I simply read my book and made sure that me and my family will never fly TAP. STAR Atrocious customer service. Poor level of English announcements.

London Heathrow to Lisbon days before we flew airline had cancelled flight and re-arranged it - did not tell us. On return we checked in and were allocated seats at boarding nine passengers were prevented from boarding as they had overbooked the flight they split families only our daughter was allowed to fly. All our baggage was on the plane. Our daughter counted at least 5 empty seats on the plane one next to her. Only offer from TAP was to make flights to Algiers Geneva Nice then Heathrow - taking over 24 hours. Manager refused to come and see us. TAP staff eventually gave up trying to resolve issue and left us to find solution with TAP staff in departures. Spent two hours with them they arranged overnight hotel and taxi transfers. Flew back next day with B.A. through Madrid. Then spent another two hours trying to get our baggage back. B.A. service was brilliant compared to TAP. Will never fly with them again.

Had a two leg journey on TAP: Lisbon - Dakar June 25. At check-in in Helsinki was informed that the flight will be delayed for at least 3 hours. It ended up being delayed 8 hours and no representative was available to assist at the gate until much later - a 10 euro food coupon was issued! No talk of being sent to a hotel while waiting. As a result of this delay I arrived in Lisbon at 2.30 am local time and despite assurances no-one met the arrivals who were transferring to other flights until several hours later. An agent shuffled various new flight coupons but there were none for our family. Obviously we had missed the continuing TAP flight hours before bound for Dakar. Now at Lisbon airport no hotel room was available and we were not allowed access to a lounge either. We were each given a breakfast and lunch coupon and I was given phone cards as I had no way of communicating to Dakar that we were delayed. My family ended up spending an entire day at the airport and the next flight to Dakar moreover took off 2 hours later than scheduled. The total waiting time in Helsinki and Lisbon was 24 hours.

Flew from LHR to LIS and back from 30/07/14 to 04/08/14. Was initially really worried due to the extent of negative comments on this website but to my relief the whole trip went by without a single hiccup! We travelled in a party of 4 checked in the previous night online and printed off luggage tags and boarding passes at the kiosk at the airport making the whole process very quick as all that was left was luggage drop-off and security. Our flights were on time and we even arrived at both destinations 10 mins ahead of schedule! Shame about the food but it's only a 2 hour and 40min flight so I'm not that bothered.

For the second year running TAP have re-scheduled our return flight to the UK giving us minimal time to make other arrangements. This year we have been offered a return flight from Porto to London via Madeira with a total journey time of 10 hours as opposed to just over 2 hours for a direct flight. I would not use TAP again.

### TAP Portugal customer review
Rio-Lisbon-London 25th July 2014 22.35. Flight delayed until 26th July at 05.20. No explanation given other than the incoming flight from Lisbon was delayed! Put up in local airport hotel but forced to leave hotel at 2am to check in. Checking in at the hotel for a 4 hour stay took ages as each customer had to fill in a form. Not acceptable in any way and no TAP rep to help. Old plane from Rio worst legroom on long haul ever experienced and food (chicken?) was very dried out. IFE ancient. Most screens on a 10 hour flight did not work and those that did showed rolling programme of a few channels for which there was no info. At check-in at Rio we had been allocated a rearranged flight for Lisbon departure of 18.50 which was impossible to make and quite predictably the gates for this flight had closed as we arrived at Lisbon. No other flight was available until 10.10 the following morning. Another airport hotel which was reasonable. TAP insisted on 7am pickup. Queued at TAP customer services at 7.30 am to get a voucher for breakfast which at first they very strongly and rudely refused. We were told that we would get a sandwich on the plane to London at 11am. After a very heated discussion a voucher was grudgingly given for 6 Euros! At no stage did we find any of the TAP staff at all apologetic. This was clearly a common experience. We eventually reached home 48 hours after leaving our Rio hotel. We will never use TAP again.

BRU-LIS-GIG-OPO-BRU in economy. Confused check-in clerk at BRU. She needed 15 minutes to complete check-in. Uneventful BRU-LIS leg. LIS-GIG on A330. Horrible food. No wine served between meals on this 10 hour daytime flight. It is not allowed. Toilets were not kept clean and nearly all ran out of toilet paper and even paper tissues. Absolutely gross I have never seen anything like it. Old-fashioned IFE on a loop system. Crew courteous but distant. Food slightly better and friendlier crew on GIG-OPO leg and luckily video on-demand was available. We were upgraded to business on OPO-BRU (operated by Portugalia) which had the friendliest crew of all four legs. All in all I would not recommend this airline.

### TAP Portugal customer review
TAP Portugal recently opened a direct route between Lisbon and Tallinn the capital of Estonia and we took the chance to visit Lisbon because of the fantastic prices they were offering. I'm at a bit of loss how to rate this airline because the first leg of the trip was excellent and the second leg was non-existent (our flight was canceled). The leg from Tallinn to Lisbon was very enjoyable despite the long flight time (almost 5 hours). The staff were very friendly the plane was nice and clean and the flight was smooth. The food was the best I've eaten on an aircraft so far. After spending a few days in Lisbon I got an e-mail that our return trip to Tallinn had been canceled. The next day I decided not to take risks and went directly to TAP Portugal's office in the city and got new tickets from Lisbon to Frankfurt and Frankfurt to Tallinn. The Lisbon to Frankfurt flight was operated by a Bulgarian charter airline. Frankfurt to Tallinn was Lufthansa. Both of the flights went fine. However the Frankfurt flight is a flight that is late 56% of the time! We were rather nervous whether we would catch the connecting flight to Tallinn or not. On top of that because the flight to Frankfurt left so early (14.20 instead of 22.00 which was the original departure time to Tallinn) and because I had to run to TAP Portugal's office and then to the airport to check-in and print the boarding passes we more or less lost an entire day of our vacation in Lisbon. The root of the problem is that TAP Portugal seems to have a very aggressive expansion policy they are opening new routes but the capacity in terms of airplanes and crew are simply not there to support it. That's why for example the Frankfurt flight was flown by BH Air the Bulgarian charter airline. On top of that I think the Portuguese airline lacks the discipline and in-depth planning capability to make sure everything goes smoothly and that results in ruined vacations and people missing important events. The only saving grace is that TAP Portugal is a big airline and a member of Star Alliance so even if their flights get cancelled you are likely to get home. However I would think twice before using this airline again.

Everything you have heard about TAP is true! They cancelled our first plane meaning we lost two days of our holiday. Our return flight was hopelessly late and then our luggage failed to make it on board! Their pilots go on strike this month and the talk in Portugal was that they were about to be taken over.

### TAP Portugal customer review
Recent journey from northern Norway to Porto was delayed by a full 24 hours and transformed from a straightforward trip to an exhausting marathon. I received an email on July 19 that my flight with TAP from Oslo to Lisbon on the 21st had been cancelled (no reason given) and I should contact them about the flight. After spending almost an hour on the phone before getting assistance I was told that I had been put on a KLM flight to Amsterdam connecting with a TAP flight to Porto and sent a copy of the new routing. All went well until I arrived in Amsterdam to discover that the TAP flight to Porto had been cancelled. There was no TAP staff available at the transfer desk and I finally obtained help from the staff at the Star Alliance lounge. I was put on a TAP flight to Lisbon the next day at 11.45 am with a wait until 5.45pm for the connecting half hour flight to Porto. The flight to Porto was delayed 1.5 hours so that I missed the last bus from Porto airport to my final destination. Needless to say I am a bit apprehensive about my return flights on TAP from Porto to Lisbon and onward to Oslo this coming Monday. All in all my experience with TAP has been frustrating and irritating and I will think twice before using them again in the future.

### TAP Portugal customer review
Recife to London via Lisbon and the next day flew London to Kolkata via Mumbai with Jet Airways. The 2nd time now the flight from Recife to Lisbon has been cancelled and changed to another time which is not so bad. But the second time on this leg that it was in fact not a TAP plane at all but a charter plane from 'Euro Atlantic' being operated by TAP. It was a terrible 1986 aircraft no operational TV's for a long haul flight seat did not go back at all and it was a night flight! TAP advertise all these great things about their cabin on their website and twice now out of 4 flights on this journey you end up paying the same but getting a far inferior product. What is wrong with TAP do that not have or can they not maintain their own planes? It's a long way round but from now on I think we will fly via Rio or SP to Recife in order to avoid TAP.

### TAP Portugal customer review
Worst Flight experience I have had so far (I am a frequent flyer). I had a flight from Lisbon to Recife (Brazil). The plane was old. My seat was loose and uncomfortable. After take off I complained about it. There was no inflight video service. On an 8 hour flight drinks were only served twice. When I asked for water she rejected my request. There was no alternative meal only a sandwich with bad cheese ham and no butter and rice with dry chicken no sauce. Nothing else for eight hours. I am not tall but my knees touched the seat in front of me.

### TAP Portugal customer review
My husband and I booked a flight to see the World Cup in Rio at the beginning of June. We met some people on the flight who had problem with their flights from Portugal to Rio de Janeiro. The queue at the airport to get new flights was long. We could already see the problem the company had with delays. I have nothing to say about the service onboard the food or the entertainment. Everything was nice. The problem is the administration and the schedules they have. On our way back from Rio we got the bad news that our flight to Portugal was delayed 8 hrs. Instead of flying that night at 22.30 we were supposed to fly the day after at 6.30 am. We got just vouchers for dinner. No hotel so we spent the night at the airport. No explanation about the delay. In Portugal we had another delay. I understand some planes have problems my disappointment came later on with the impossible mission to get in touch with TAP by e-mail. This is the worst service I've experienced!

### TAP Portugal customer review
Flew TAP from Barcelona to Lisbon and then Lisbon to London Gatwick last week. Overall check in was smooth and friendly and the plane was well kept. The seats were comfortable perhaps due to a lower load factor. In fact the seating was better than the long haul of most airlines. Service was excellent. The crew always wore a smile and response to your request and they were well groomed. Their inflight magazine was also of top quality. I also enjoy the safety video a lot.

Copenhagen-Lisbon-Funchal 7/7/2014. This was a travel with delay cancellation more delay and on top: Luggage lost for 6 days (our vacation was 9 days). Nobody from TAP Portugal really cared: "Usually the luggage appears again! Hotel said: "Big problem all year but especially in the summer time. About 10-15 passengers from this plane lost their luggage this night but this was not unusual I was told. Never again TAP Portugal!

Due to fly to Lisbon on Thursday from Manchester 17/07/14 we were told the flight had been cancelled and the only alternative offered was for the following day via London and Madrid! A 9 hour journey plus travel time from home and to our hotel-another 4 hours. It emerged TAP had known the previous evening the flight would be cancelled and had they emailed to inform us I would now be sitting on a sunny beach in Portugal having flown via EasyJet instead of spending ages trying to contact TAP who are not responding and writing this in Wet Wales. A lousy experience all round with this airline.

Booked a TAP flight from LHR to Fortaleza Brazil for the world cup. Received a call from TAP the day before flying that the second leg from Lisbon to Fortaleza would be operated by Windrose (a Ukrainian company working with TAP) so no time to change your flight (rebooking or cancellation as you need to get to your destination). 1st leg from Heathrow was OK. The second leg operated by Windrose departed 1 hour later than scheduled from Lisbon including a wait of 30 mins inside the bus taking us from the gate to the aircraft. The aircraft was an old A330. It had no entertainment system (No movies no music no games - nothing). What do you do on a 7hr journey like this? Although the Windrose crew were friendly and should not be blamed for anything this is a real disgrace for TAP selling a product that is below current long haul travel standards and not playing fair and transparent with the customer about the product which they are selling. Return trip left 1hr 30mins late but I'll leave this complaint for a different day. Will I fly TAP again? I'd rather pay for a direct flight from LHR to Brazil next time. They are definitely not doing themselves any favours.

GIG-LIS-A330-200. An old ones (once Swissair). Seats are very new and very comfortable but inflight entertainment dates from last century. Note for an extremely friendly staff. Food was very pleasant however Portuguese selection of wines was poor. Portugal has much better wines that deserve to be served. No French Champagne. An acid Sparkling wine. Late take off on-time at arrival. Luggage very quick.

I flew GIG-LIS-PRG and GVA-LIS-SSA between June in July and 3 out of these 4 flights were delayed. The first delayed flight from Rio to Lisbon had a delay of 4 hours. From the airport display (on June 14) it was the only delayed international flight that night. The last flight from Salvador to Rio on July 5 delayed at least one hour. The third flight to Geneva to Lisbon on July 4 was my worst flight ever. TAP managed again to have the only delayed flight in the display gave up the flight to a Spanish company (Swift air) that had a terrible flight service and very outdated aircraft (some baggage compartments didn't close properly). We had problems in the arrival in Lisbon as well. After all I planned to leave the airport by 1PM and take a tour in Lisbon but thanks to TAP this happened at 4pm.

We flew from London Heathrow at the start of our holidays and flight was 35 minutes late. On the return journey we flew from Porto to Lisbon 30 minutes late and from Lisbon to London Heathrow 45 minutes late. Need I say more.

### TAP Portugal customer review
London - Lisbon Lisbon - Miami. Delays all the way there with no communication just sitting waiting. Delays all the way home with no communication. No in-flight entertaining (broken "unable to reset as the one staff member who could do it was off on leave) so no inflight entertainment travelling with four children! Nightmare. Food/snacks were good but would never use them again.

Flew TAP from Newark to Lisbon. Left on schedule. Nice flight attendants. The only problem I had was they had no cups in the lavatories and I went in there with my bag to take medication but no cups for water. I exited and asked flight attendant that there were no cups in the bathroom she stated they did not provide cups in the lavatories. Strange. The food was the worst airline food I have had and I could not eat it. I only ate the dessert. My return from Lisbon to Newark was a nightmare. Checked out of hotel for 2.45pm departure only to be told at ticket counter that flight was 8 hours late with expected departure at 10pm no reason for delay was given even though I asked. Was told to go to customer service counter and was given meal coupon. So needless to say I spent the whole day in Lisbon airport and half the night. The departure was 10.20pm there was no order at gate hundreds of people just standing around waiting. No place to sit had to stand. It was a nightmare. Finally boarded and took off. Once again the meal was terrible I could not eat it so went hungry. Flight attendant offered cod or "meat". I asked what kind of meat and got nothing but a strange look. Overall experience was a bad one.

### TAP Portugal customer review
Up until now I've not had a list of airlines to absolutely avoid in the future. Congratulations TAP - you are the first on that list. Never have I experienced such ridiculous service or felt so uncomfortable on a flight. Flying from London to Recife via Lisbon and back from Rio to London via Lisbon every single one of the flights was delayed by at least an hour. Crazy enough though I think we were the 'lucky' ones as on the outgoing leg most of the TAP flights on the Lisbon departure board were delayed by 5+ hours. What is going on?! There was absolutely no entertainment from Lisbon to Recife either and the leg room was terrible making the flight seem like an eternity. In addition the food was just awful. Never again will I fly with this company - I will pay a lot more to avoid it.

### TAP Portugal customer review
Flew from Malaga to Lisbon on TP 1077 June 23rd 2014 and paid an excess luggage fee of 150 euros. After arrival in Lisbon waited for luggage to come down luggage carousel and only 1 piece of luggage not mine came down. Was told by TAP representative that luggage was not loaded onto this aircraft due to weight restrictions and to place a lost luggage claim. Late Wednesday night June 25th the luggage finally arrived at my hotel in Lisbon after being routed from Malaga to Frankfurt and then to Lisbon. Totally unacceptable service.

FNC-LIS-AGP-LIS-FNC. First flight took off on time though there was a passenger in front of me who had her seat fully reclined so my flight was a nightmare and even lost my sandwich because I couldn't even spread my arms. The cabin crew saw this but did nothing. Flight LIS-AGP was late by half an hour this was their inaugural flight using ATR 42 on the route which they used a Beechcraft 1900 before but if you didn't know you wouldn't notice it. The flight AGP-LIS was late by 2 hours and almost lost the connecting flight LIS-FNC. AGP-LIS had the most appalling flight attendant I can't understand why TAP would pay a salary to have people like him who would be better driving a truck than hosting passengers. He just didn't care. On the flight LIS-FNC we were late by 1h and a half plus they emailed me a week before to say the flight had been rescheduled. Ended up flying more time than usual due to high winds in Madeira. However the food on all flights were quite good indeed. All in all the very usual mediocre service you get from TAP.

### TAP Portugal customer review
Lisbon-Malaga and return (TAP 1076/1079) end of June and beginning of July. The first leg of the flight was fine in a Beechcraft 1900D with nineteen seats. The only "drama" was watching our fellow passengers when they had a good look at the kind of plane they were using for the trip. No problems at all and flight arrived on scheduled. Unfortunately in the return trip they managed to have a delay of three hours on a flight that only last one hour and fifteen minutes in a ATR 72 from Helitt. The official reason was that the flight crew had exceeded their flight times.

Flew from USA to Europe round-trip 4 flights as connection through Lisbon. First flight the Atlantic portion they ran out of soap in the bathroom and the last hours of the flight some toilets not working/flushing. One of our seats was broken and would recline the adjacent passenger's screen was not working so he would look across the aisle at another screen. We were about 2 hours delayed so while we didn't miss our connections others on board did. The return flight better except again no soap in the bathroom. The entertainment on the screen was terrible unless you consider one war movie and the following movie Mulan good choices for an 8 hour flight. The flight left timely although the other passengers (about 5) we spoke to said their other flights were late. The food was fair/good. Would avoid this airline for future travels.

### TAP Portugal customer review
Flew London - Lisbon then Lisbon - Recife June 11th 2014. Flight cancelled to Brazil without notice even though TAP knew no plane from Lisbon available. Shipped to Marriot made to pay for beverages. Advised to get up at 3am for rescheduled next morning flight. Got up and then advised plane would be delayed until 7am departure. Another 2 hour delay occurred. No TAP representative at Hotel. No TAP Representative to meet us next morning at Lisbon airport. Speaking to fans at games TAP did this on Wednesday Thursday and Friday of this week! On return flight 1 July 11.25pm from Recife to Lisbon TAP swapped the plane to a charter airline Air Europa and emailed me 4 hours before departure saying I could change my flight if I desired. Having already checked out of Hotel and waiting in Recife for 6 hours what did they elect me to do. The charter plane was obviously known about days in advance so why did they not email sooner so I could have arranged alternative transport home. The staff on the plane were superb but the plane seating was a disaster tiny seat pitch and no entertainment. The seating was cocked up by TAP staff at Recife issuing seats that did not exist and making the boarding process delayed.

### TAP Portugal customer review
Lisbon to Rome and vice-versa (June 30th and July 4th) was late on both days. On the 4th of July the plane was supposed to take off at 7.25pm (local hour) but at 9pm the plane was still taxiing to the runway. Except for this detail I enjoyed both flights. On the first flight (Lisbon-Rome) I found the breakfast surprisingly good (for an airline meal). The sandwich had a strange appearance but I wanted another one when I finished. On the second flight a light meal (not a full dinner) was served. I also found the potato puree with turkey sausages and bacon pretty tasty. The flight crew were also very nice and attentive although on the first flight they seemed a little tired. At least they were not rude and on the same flight I saw the flight attendants speaking Portuguese English Italian French and Spanish to the passengers. The seats were comfortable and the plane in general was clean. I also thought both landings were quite rough. If you are going on shorts flights with TAP please take a book or something else. If you don't you might get stuck watching the cartoon version of Mr Bean. In general if you are going on vacations and you don't mind getting late to your destination TAP is surely a good airline. If you are going on business trips don't fly with TAP: the flights can get late and the business class didn't seem much different from the economy class. It doesn't matter anyway: most of their planes only have one class (economy).

### TAP Portugal customer review
Flight was cancelled on Wed 25th June 2014 and no organised communication or customer care was given by TAP staff. Very poor service for a Western Country based airline. Wasted our whole day. No compensation no care was granted for a frequent traveller like me and it caused huge inconvenience and cost of taking a £120 taxi back home. TAP has to step up if they wish to compete and even perhaps survive without subsidies (if any) with not only the likes of BA but also the low cost carriers like EasyJet and Ryanair. I care about TAP and had been loyal to them for many years. However it will not for long if they behave like they do now and lack pro-activeness.

### TAP Portugal customer review
My son and I flew Portugalia Airlines from Malaga to Lisbon June 2014. The leg was flown in a Beechcraft 1800D. We arrived in Lisbon without our luggage as did a half dozen other passengers. We were on a 43 day trip around the world and this was day 3. Not good. After 3 days our luggage arrived. My gripe is why did it take 3 days come to find out our luggage was never boarded in Malaga. I would guess this was due to weight restrictions as we saw them unload the baggage and there were only a few pieces. There was plenty of space left in the baggage compartment. The luggage could have been with us early the next morning. as there were several flights that could make this happen. I believe there was a neglect on the airlines side that they didn't get it to us sooner. Especially since we filed a loss luggage report at once. This would have made it a lot less stressful on us. We were about to go shopping or new clothes on day 3 of the ordeal when the 2 pieces arrived. I would fly Portugalia Airlines again but not in this type of aircraft. Employees were helpful in tracing the lost luggage but updating the online information wasn't. When it arrived it still said it was still searching for it.

Just returned from the World Cup flew London to Recife via Lisbon. On the outward sector they cancelled our flight from Lisbon to Recife we only found out about this at the departure gate at Heathrow! Absolute disgrace. As for the flights (all sectors) it has to be one of the worst airlines I have had the unfortunate experience to fly. Inflight service appalling the inflight entertainment consisted of a cartoon version of Mr Bean. Surprise surprise delayed on the return leg at Lisbon thus missing connections in London no apologies whatsoever from the crew. I will most definitely choose another airline over TAP even on short haul.

### TAP Portugal customer review
As a seasoned traveller to South America I'm disappointed to say that I'll try to avoid this airline in future. Flying to Sao Paulo via Lisbon for the World Cup both out going flights were delayed a total of 3 hours and on my return I'm informed there's yet another undetermined delay due to lack of cabin crew. Also my seat from Brazil to Lisbon had no inflight entertainment or light to read from (broken). I would also point out a good proportion of other flights were also delayed. Not the stress free travel I like and expect. They left it until the last minute to inform of delay-not helping my onward travel from Heathrow.

### TAP Portugal customer review
Lisbon-Brussels A319 economy. Absolutely excellent airline first time flying TAP and will certainly use again. Flew mid haul from LIS to BRU on a relatively new 319. Online check in was easy and allowed me to select my seats and baggage drop at the airport was quick and efficient. Flight was delayed 45minutes due to strike action but all issues were communicated early allowing me to arrive at the airport later than planned and not be affected by the delay. Economy seat was wider than most rival airlines and leg room was certainly larger than usual on 319 seats were leather with full recline only downside being immovable head rest as being 6'3 it's usually too low however legroom was comfortable which is a rarity. Drinks were served during the flight (complimentary soft drinks and alcohol) as well as a tasty sandwich snack. Staff were very polite and friendly and switched effortlessly from English to Portuguese and French. Entertainment was provided in the form of drop down TV screens mostly showing cartoons with very low sound throughout the cabin which wasn't distracting. Ultimately probably the best airline I've flown over such a short distance very impressed and will be looking into using them ongoing.

### TAP Portugal customer review
Flew Brasilia-London-Lisbon-Brasilia in Business class not for the first time. It's never been great but this time the aircraft on the transatlantic legs were simply dreadful offering Business class from about 1990. Really ancient A330s with basic seats and an IFE that doesn't allow you to stop/start films on request and which offered only about six films anyway. These days that's just pathetic. On the last leg (LIS-BSB) there were only nine (9) people in Business and still I couldn't get my first choice meal - attendant said "only two trays of the chicken were boarded" - so I had overcooked and tasteless veal instead. On more than one occasion attendants on TAP have encouraged me to write and complain - they clearly feel passengers aren't getting a good deal. On these flights in June 2014 attendants were just great - thereby just about saving the airline in my view. We use TAP because I can get to the UK in only two flights from Brasilia not three. If other airlines were to offer this I'd take it - and Air France are starting to do so. So I'll be reviewing my bookings. TAP I think is getting away with using old and poor aircraft on their flights in and out of Brazil because they know they've got an almost captive market - hope they get some competition soon to jerk them into updating their sad old fleet.

### TAP Portugal customer review
Quite appalling on a consistent basis on short haul flights to the rest of Europe from Lisbon. Delays of 1 hour are normal and today I have an 8 hour delay. And was lied to several times on the cause. Shocking. I am a gold card holder of TAP and I have decided not use them again. The flight timings have been awful and not replicated by other airlines on the same route and the service at the counter as well as on the plane is very poor.

### TAP Portugal customer review
I am an experienced traveler through North America the Caribbean and Europe and have never had a worst experience with an airline. My flight was scheduled to depart at 23.50 and at 23.50 we were told that our flight had been cancelled due to lack of crew (conveniently during the Portugal USA football match). We were not allowed to get our luggage and informed that everything would be at the hotel upon arrival. We were instructed at the gate that a new flight would be available for all of us the following morning. We were led to a bus and dropped off at the wrong hotel and abandoned by any TAP employee. We then picked up our belongings and walked 20 minutes to the proper hotel. Upon arrival here there was no information provided. After several calls to the front desk and the airline I was finally told that we could go for lunch at 13.00 with still no information on a new flight. I called several times until I finally booked with a new airline as I had to be back for another flight to North America. I arrived 24 hours after my original flight was scheduled. I will never use TAP Portugal nor recommend it to anyone.

Flight TP1827 LIS-TER 21/06/2014. This flight was a nightmare the worst airline customer service I have experienced. The flight was scheduled to depart at 6.20pm at 8.30pm the information available was that the flight was delayed. At 10.00pm no one from TAP approached us or give us an explanation. At 11.00pm someone arrived and communicated that the flight was cancelled no food or compensation just a ride to a cheap hotel where a meal will be served. At the airport TAP told us the flight was cancelled a new flight will be operated on Monday 23/06/2014. We felt totally abandoned without any luggage or information. On a 40 hour delay TAP only gave us two cheap meals and a five euro phone card. The flight on Monday 23 departed 1 hr 40 mins late and the food served on board was edible. I will never fly TAP again.

I have just returned from a trip to Brazil but I will never fly with TAP again. I had booked flights from Heathrow to Natal via Lisbon. The day before my departure I found out by chance that the Lisbon - Natal flight had been cancelled (after I had checked in online and printed my boarding pass). The same thing happened to the return flight. Each time there was no explanation. Furthermore when I arrived in Lisbon to get my connecting flight to Heathrow I discovered that this flight had also been cancelled - due to a lack of crew. They wanted to put passengers up in a hotel overnight but I went to customer services and was able to get on a flight later that evening even though I was initially told that there were no available seats. That flight was delayed by over an hour but I was just relieved to be on a plane home. My experience was not unique. I had friends making the same trip on different flights and they all had similar experiences.

I flew June 17 from Lisbon to Rio de Janeiro in business class. The trip to Rio I do 3-4 times every year and this time took TAP because of the flights departure time. I have used most of the airlines flying the route but this was the second time with TAP. TAP was a more positive experience than I feared everything was more or less ok apart from entertainment. The programs and the quality was low. The seat was comfortable but not high-class the staff did their jobs - nothing more and the food was usual plane food. The aircraft felt old. I can imagine traveling with TAP again if necessary.

Flight TP322 Lisbon-Manchester 09/06/2014. On arrival at Baggage drop at Lisbon Airport informed 1hr delay. Boarded plane and engineers working on aircraft captain said small tec fault and delay of 15-20 mins. After 30 mins air-con switched on and water distributed by cabin crew captain said still working on fault and further delay of approx same length. After 1hr on plane Captain said fault could not be fixed and that we were to be put on another plane resulting in total delay of 3hrs. We were kept informed throughout not kept in dark like some airlines. On flight back to Manchester made up 30 mins but on arrival had to wait 1hr 08mins for bags to be delivered to carousel (problem with Menzies ground staff common event). Not what you want after 3hr delay.

### TAP Portugal customer review
I had a flight from NY to Barcelona with a connecting flight in Lisbon. We landed at 7am with a 9am departure. We had to go through customs first and that's when problems began. There was a massive crowd ahead of us. Not wanting to chance it I asked a TAP employee if they could help us out. I was politely told not to worry. They would come get us out of the line and through customs to make sure we made our flight. As it got closer to 9am I as well as others asked several more times to TAP employees if they could help us. We were told the same answer. Finally myself and others demanded something be done. They let us go through only to see the doors for our flight closed and locked. I'm told this is typical in Lisbon. They lie to you to put you off and you're suppose to thank them for a meal voucher while you wait 6 hours for the next flight. Guess what I'll never go through Lisbon after this trip or use TAP.

TAP from Manchester UK to Funchal via Lisbon Sunday 1st June delayed 2 hours in Lisbon as they "couldn't find a crew". Seating on both legs very tight inflight service virtually non existent poor dry sandwich and half a glass of wine given begrudgingly.

Very poor airline regarding timekeeping - wonder if I will get home tonight?

Barcelona - Lisbon - Barcelona. The delays on both flights cost me a lot seams this is a daily problem. On the way back I arrived in Barcelona 3 hours late. The online check in only works by Phone call. Aircraft from Barcelona to Lisbon was dirty additionally they have redefined the meaning of "meal" to refer to a minuscule triangle of dry bread and a small drink. Very bad on refills only got 15cl of cheap orange juice. Staff should be more friendly.

TP486 from Lisbon to Nice on 27 May. Promo ticket for 60 euros. 2.25 hour flight. Was dreading TAP after all the bad reviews but had a great experience. Web check and bag drop at Lisbon Portela worked fine (Lisbon terminal 1 is great on departure). Warm welcome from crew with on time departure and early arrival into Nice. Only negatives were the old plane (an old Fokker) and the food (hot dinner of bacalhau fish pie. Bit stodgy for my liking. Crew warm and attentive and not stingy with the wine. Bonus about this old plane was the legroom and seat cushioning- obviously pre-dates the days of beancounters running airlines! Not sure about flying them longhaul though (flew Lufthansa from Rio to Europe enroute from NZ and they were competent). Great value for money paid. Will consider for future travels to/from Portugal.

Europe Round Trip - After what's been nearly a straight trimester of travel and suitcase living I'm glad to now be home for a rest. This past month was especially brutal. What should have been an easy week in my home town Lisbon and a round trip to Warsaw Barcelona Madeira Paris and Berlin had me racking up more travel follies in one trip than I've experienced in the past 3 years. I managed to have one of the worst flight experiences of my life with TAP out of 5 flights for the week only one wasn't delayed for over 2 hours. You have to love when you leave the gate for a 2.5 hour flight only to have to sit on the plane an extra 2.5 hours before taking off (and then of due to the delays you miss your connection home and have to spend an extra night in a hotel and the flight home the next morning is delayed over 2 hours too). Despite the chronic delays expensive tickets old aircraft's and bad food the experience was not good TAP is an airline I will avoid at all cost in the future.

LGW-LIS what a shambling miserable experience! Cabin crew unfriendly none smiled once during boarding or during the flight. One hour into the flight before any cabin crew were seen and even then made to feel as if they were doing you a favour. Food cold so it was not as if they were preparing a gastronomic delight which they certainly were not. I would suggest the crew from this flight look for other jobs if they are that miserable. I doubt I would fly with TAP again. Airline let down by their crew who could do with some customer focused training!

Lisbon to Luanda Round Trip in economy class. This was my last flight with TAP Portugal on this route the tickets are expensive compared with poor service you receive in exchange. Old aircraft with refurbished interiors poor food and delays in both flights. The flight to Luanda was a nightmare I endured 8 hours listening to a screaming child was not kids fault but crew fault. I ask to change seat and it was denied without any reason or explanation I saw available seats on the back. After this episode not one cabin crew member to be seen for hours. On the way back (night flight) the food they served was inedible many meals barely touched and passengers complaining. The cabin staff was more friendly but was visible that this situation was definitely harder for them to. If you value on-time flights comfort service and price avoid TAP Portugal.

Budapest - Lisbon - Porto and back. The food was really good and served with metal cutlery not plastic. The seats were good for TAP. I marked entertainment as "fair" but everybody is using tablets kindles so this is really not a problem And most importantly my luggage not only arrived but it was unharmed which has happened only once in my last six flights and made me really desperate.

### TAP Portugal customer review
TP 619 BRU-LIS Apr 30 and TP 574 LIS-FRA May 3. Technically reliable airline flying a relatively new fleet with generally friendly crews. Hopelessly incapable of flying on time though. Have flown them 8 times since December only once was the flight on time otherwise delays varied between 30 and 90 minutes. Moreover hardly ever info is given to passengers or even an apology. Executive (Business) class is quite comfortable on long-haul flights but seats in Economy are very uncomfortable and there is basically no space left when the passenger in front of you decides to recline his or her seat. Do not recommend if you value punctuality.

### TAP Portugal customer review
Thankfully this flight was much better than the other reviews had us believe. It was a 3 hour flight to Lisbon from Frankfurt. The staff at check in and onboard were very friendly and full of life. The food and drinks were served efficiently. Very tasty too but we skipped the octopus! Our seats in row1 on the 319 plane were comfortable but we weren't looking to sleep. The incline isn't very much. We had our own movies on IPads as there was no other "entertainment". It was an enjoyable flight.

### TAP Portugal customer review
I haven't flown TAP for over 10 years but have recently decided to try their business class on a flight from London to Recife in Brazil. What a disappointment! Both my flights were delayed and to find the small overcrowded business lounge at Lisbon airport was a challenge. I had to go through customs and immigration and the TAP ground staff were very unhelpful. The flight experience was very poor. The seats were old fashioned and uncomfortable and the inflight entertainment was very limited. The food was just edible but the staff service was inconsistency and disorganised. A total waste of money and I would not recommend it to anyone.

### TAP Portugal customer review
LIS-ZAG via BLQ business. My return flight back within one month. At this occasion more or less the same thing. Uncomfortable seats where the lumbar part is squeezing you inside. No pitch at all and the middle seat 01E next to me was occupied even if there were 2 empty seats in row 2 and 3. As it was Easter Thursday some economy pax were upgraded to C allowing us to have less space as usual. If I compare the 980 euro C class to other carriers than it is definitely not worth spending that kind of money for the same cabin as economy. The food was one course only and acceptable. Cabin crew service was incompetent unhelpful and mainly hidden in the rear galley during 5h flight. No welcome drink no entertainment no newspapers no nothing. Fortunately on this occasion I did not pay for the flight but would never buy such a product by myself. Last but not least TAP did not find my lost bag from the outbound flight nor did they took any responsibility so far almost 50 days later!

DUS-LIS-DUS and again very nice experience nice and smiling crews fair food and beverages. TAP planes are very quiet inside compared to the same Airbus Types used by e.g. Lufthansa. Monitors at least exist allowing passengers to see the usual movies and the flight routing. Very good value for money. Contrary to others I feel the "old" TAP seats are much more comfortable than the thin new seats used by other airlines. One last remark: The onboard magazine is for sure one of the best throughout the world.

### TAP Portugal customer review
EWR-OPO-BRU and AMS-LIS-EWR. Was pleasantly surprised by the practicality and quality of this airline. They fly the Newark - Porto route twice/week and the Newark - Lisbon route the remaining 5 days. I paid only $789 for the round trip multi city flight and although I couldn't pick seats until 24 hours prior to departure I got window seats both ways and a bulkhead window seat on the return from Lisbon to Newark (11j)! Food was decent/edible although they were a little stingy on wine and tea/coffee ( they only fill glasses half way and are bad on refills). The A332 from Newark to Porto was newer then the return aircraft and had touchscreen on demand entertainment with dozens of movies including new releases like 12 yrs a slave and Dallas Buyers Club. The return A332 had personal TVs as well but the movies were on channels 1-16 and started at a set time. Flew Portugalia operated Fokker 100 to Brussels from Porto which was fine. They served a lox sandwich. Food on the return Lisbon to EWR flight had descent food - fish pie (like shepherds) and a prosciutto sandwich as a snack before landing. All edible which is how I rate airline food (edible or non-edible).

MUC-LIS-MUC. My business trips this year resulted in booking of 6 flights with TAP to Lisbon. These were my very first flights with TAP. I must say they have a nice service from the check in counter to the flight itself. Check in was fair more easy if the TAP mobile App work not in my case. Flight attendants were friendly with two small incidents in two flights. The downside is the aircraft itself very old sometimes dirty and no leg room. From those who come from Lufthansa flights with a new minimal and slim cabin layout TAP offers a 70's and 80's experience who is not pleasant on this days. The food was fair and we had slight delays on all flights. I wouldn't recommend this airline you pay a prime price and receive a service that's already outdated.

LIS-FAO-LIS. Business Class. They are selling Business Class with no service and same seats as Economy. On the way to FAO I had to ask for a cup of water. On the way back they offered a cup of coffee. In both cases seats were uncomfortable (1F & 1A) no leg room. I just felt robbed.

### TAP Portugal customer review
ZAG-LIS with stop in BLQ 11 March 2014. No possibility to select seat online. The business class cabin is exactly the same as economy and the pitch is very narrow. Boarding was on time and we left on time. However the short stop in Bologna was 1 hour for 48 passengers who boarded. The service was below average. Nothing served on the first leg of 50 minutes. When asked I got a drink and peanuts. The second leg was better with nice selection of food and wine well presented. However the cabin crew were mostly in the galley chit-chatting and only taking care of us when strictly necessary. No IFE at all during 5.5 hr flight! We arrived 15 minutes ahead of schedule in Lisbon but parked in an outside position. It took us more than 30 mins to disembark due to very slow ground service provided. Finally my bag was lost.

### TAP Portugal customer review
Flew from Lisbon to Salvador in Business Class. On the positive the first meal that was served was excellent and flight attendants (most of them) very friendly and attentive. There was a wide selection of food and good wines (incl. Port Wine). The second meal a sandwich was very average: I would not pay 2 Euros for it in a shop. But the main problem is with the seat and the entertainment system: it is all so old that one asks him/herself if it's really worth the 3500 Euros they charge for those flights? I would not fly Business with TAP again until they upgrade their seats and their entertainment system.

LIS-LHR on 10th March. Anyway after a seamless check-in there was a structured boarding and coached out to the aircraft. Very friendly welcome on board followed by in flight service of a sandwich tea/coffee wine or soft drink. In flight videos were also provided. Left on time and arrived early. As I was on a connecting flight to EDI I was concerned about my baggage transfer at LHR but no problems whatsoever. Good performance all around!

### TAP Portugal customer review
I fly TAP quite frequently between MAN-LIS-FAO. I have always enjoyed the experience crew are friendly comfortable seating with complimentary food/drink (including very nice Portuguese red wine if you want). I could fly on one of the LoCo MAN or LPL to FAO direct and do sometimes but to fly with TAP in comparison is just so nice its my first choice. Fares are good also free hold luggage allowance.

### TAP Portugal customer review
LHR-LIS LIS-FUN return LIS-LHR. Four flights over six weeks all on time. Friendly crews reasonable refreshments pre-bookable exit row seats. Not so good on the ground - changed flight times to our disadvantage and charged for excess baggage at LHR in Euros but would only accept payment in sterling at a rip-off exchange rate. Overall though would definitely use the airline again.

BCN-LIS-BCN. Unfortunately we had a terrible experience from BCN to LIS. We pre-reserved seats which were not respected even being TAP Corporate/Upgrade Program with all the benefits of Silver/Gold TAP milles card. Check in at BCN was basic not giving a decent corporate service. I was not advised about the seats and lounge options. Flight BCN-LIS departed 40m late and have plenty of free seats. Airbus aircraft was dirty and old. The cabin crew served poor food (same food as economy). Drinks OK but no chance to repeat because the crew disappeared for the entire flight. Reading light was not working staff did not do anything to help. My return flight to Barcelona was better but the 2 hr 40min delay without any info is unacceptable. TAP corporate Lounge in Lisbon is small was pack smelly and they only served cheap snacks. Boarding by bus 40m pack inside the bus and the airplane was extremely old. All in all not a good experience to captive new customers. TAP is trying hard to innovate but the competition is always two steps ahead TAP. For the price I paid I would not recommend and will never repeat!

GIG-LIS-FAO Business Class. Service is improving. A very friendly staff decent food wines have a higher quality than usual except sparkling which is not true Champagne just a Portuguese acid sparkling wine. Seat as on LH is outdated. Flight was on time. Lounge is LIS was full but with a great choice of food newspapers and drinks.

### TAP Portugal customer review
Have just returned from a round trip from London Heathrow to Brasilia via Lisbon and back. I am not usually one to write a review but on this occasion I felt compelled to after the appalling service I received in Business Class. On the outbound route the staff were curt unhelpful and rude the food disgusting and the seats uncomfortable. The entertainment was on a loop video system as found on aircraft in the 1980's with some of the screens defective. Upon arrival in Brazil quite a lot of the baggage mine included had been left at Lisbon and did not arrive until 3 days later. We had to go to the airport to collect it. Returning on the inbound flights no lounge was provided for TAP air Business Class customers and likewise on the transfer at Lisboa Airport no airside lounge was available so had to sit for 3 hours by the gate. Finally upon arrival at Heathrow the baggage took over an hour to get to the carousel. All in all a terrible experience.

### TAP Portugal customer review
Travelled from Heathrow to Lisbon and then on to Fortaleza. Flight from LHR ok but nothing special. Flight to Fortaleza was slightly delayed. Seating in economy is cramped and inflight meal was disgusting! Our return flight was scheduled to leave Fortaleza at 22.35 hrs on Sunday 15th December and we had confirmed our seats the day before by checking in online. On arrival at Fortaleza we were told that the flight on the Saturday night had been cancelled and passengers from that flight were put on our flight. We were being 'bumped' to a later flight! We finally got away from Fortaleza about 6 hours later. The aircraft for this flight was very old no seat back TV screens cramped seating and more disgusting food. I would not travel with TAP Portugal again.

BCN-OPO/OPO-FNC/FNC-LIS/LIS-BCN. BCN-OPO operated by Portugalia. All flights were excellent. Very pleasant crew. Clean aircrafts. All on time. Drinks and snack always served onboard.

### TAP Portugal customer review
OPO-BCN-OPO. I found a cheap deal online to Barcelona after reading so many bad reviews I had low expectations that unfortunately I confirmed. Flight delays on both legs not friendly flight attendants no proper food just poor snacks but the major let down was the aircraft itself - an ancient Fokker 100 with broken seat on return that when you're seated was truly unpleasant. I did not feel particularly safe and comfortable on both flights these planes are and look very old and have to many broken parts. Don't buy TAP bargains you will have a low cost service in return.

### TAP Portugal customer review
LON-LIS-LON. Bought round trip ticket from British Airways from London Heathrow to Lisbon. Flew out on British Airways and enjoyed the excellent service. On return I lost my British Airways flight. Bought a TAP Portugal return flight from Lisbon. I was initially happy to use TAP "main Portuguese carrier" instead of low-cost carriers like Ryanair or Easyjet. TAP Portugal is a low-cost carrier with expensive tickets and lousy service. Flight was delayed 1 hr 20 mins no excuses or proper information given to passengers. Disorganised boarding with unprofessional ladies shouting no apologies from captain or crew there was no inflight entertainment newspaper magazines or wi-fi on the flight to London. Only drinks served for the entire flight. Leg room was very poor. So the return journey had all the hallmarks of a "no frills" budget airline. However the ticket was purchased at a premium (almost££380 for the return journey in Economy class) when Ryanair and Easyjet charge £65. Unless things change with TAP Portugal they will go down it is only a matter of time before customers go to low-cost carriers they receive the same service TAP offered me but 5 times cheaper. I certainly wont be flying on TAP Portugal in the near future!

Round trip Luanda - Lisbon in economy January 2014. The day trip to Lisbon was treated as though it was a night flight for more than half of the time if you turned on the light you were disturbing your neighbours. The food was terrible both ways and I travel quite a bit in economy. My seat on the flight back was also painful and it was only 7.5 hours. I will not recommend this airline.

### TAP Portugal customer review
Lisbon-Warsaw. Check-in smooth Fast Track through security off to the TAP Lounge which is quite small even though it looks big because of mirrors used. At this time lounge was very crowded so I had to stand at the bar. Flight was surprisingly on time on A319. Nice and professional cabin crew full service including hot meal and full bar service. Arrived 25 mins ahead of schedule. TAP offers decent consistent service the only down point is that they always start meal/drinks service after reaching cruising altitude which in some cases is after 1-1.5 hrs after take off! This time first carts arrived after 1hr 25 mins after departure no cabin crew visible before that! Ridiculous!

### TAP Portugal customer review
Used their LIS - AGP route several times as this is the only operator between these airports. They need to change their aircraft which is very old and tired. The main problem is that they won't take golf clubs. This is ridiculous when both these destinations have fantastic golf.

Dakar to Geneva. Flight from Dakar to Lisbon 2.5 hours late. Missed connecting flight and had to wait in Lisbon for 7 hours and then the flight to Geneva was 1.5 hours late. On the way back flight from Geneva was 30 min late missed connecting flight in Lisbon had to wait until the next night to take the flight to Dakar which was 2 hours late. Flight attendants were reasonably polite and helpful but food horrible. TAP is always late and you need at least 4 hours time difference between arrival and departure at Lisbon to ensure you will not miss your connecting flight.

All the negative reviews I have read about Tap Air Portugal are justified as I had don't have anything good to say about the 9.15am flight Lisbon to Munich on September 25 2013. An unexpected no breakfast service announcement echoed on the pa system just before departure. I am still shocked to see Lufthansa somehow use this no class outfit to cater to its paying customers.

### TAP Portugal customer review
Flew LIS to GIG economy 23 December. Long wait on bus at gate before long drive to plane and long wait on bus again before boarding. At first it looked like there was adequate space in seat but then seat in front of me was fully reclined for 9 hours squashing me into my seat unable to use tray table or watch the IFE. It is a very primitive system anyway with only a few channels on a cycle. Cabin service was woeful and finished up dehydrated because drinks only offered once. I have been Star Gold for all of the last 10 years. This was my first and will be last flight with TAP.

### TAP Portugal customer review
20/12/2013 - Business Class flight (TP11) from LIS to REC. The worst business class flight experienced in my life. Priority boarding done with other classes. No matter if you are biz or gold member. All classes were boarded at the same time. IFE system very poor. Only 5 video channel and an outdated music channel list. Food: very poor in quality and quantity. I discovered that they serve the same food also on the economy class. In this case chicken and rice pudding were the same. The only difference was on the choice (4 options) for the main course and on the plate (plastic in ECO and ceramic in BIZ). Staff: impolite and unfriendly. Seat comfort: no flat bed but acceptable. Landing in REC on time.

### TAP Portugal customer review
I flew from ZRH to LIS in Business Class. There was no flight attendant available during the safety demonstration. Very unusual. The meal served was not really edible. That was it no more drinks nothing. The flight crew were all in the forward cabin behind the curtain talking and laughing. No features and benefits on this airline. Pay a little more and fly with a quality airline.

CPH to Lisbon. Rude flight attendants. When walking onto the plane a staff member stood there looking at the ground never said hello. Why stand there? Not a drop to drink until dinner is served about 1.5 hours into the flight. No entertainment which for a 4 hour flight is very boring. Food was disgusting I don't really know what I ate to be honest and you must request salt and pepper and it's given to you very disdainfully. I would fly SAS next time for sure.

16th Nov TP669 and back on the 17th on flight TP668. Travelled to Lisbon with some works colleagues for the weekend to get away from the cold weather in the Netherlands. The flight times were the best with TAP to make the most of the weekend. Both flights departed on time and arrived earlier. The return flight I was upgraded to Business because the flight was full and got a pretty nice dinner with plenty of Portuguese red wine! Nothing wrong to say!

### TAP Portugal customer review
Lisbon to Munich I used TAP for the first and last time the service was extremely poor and all the previous comments here are very accurate. One of my main issues was the Business Class. Worst Business Class I travel so far. In 4 flights 3 are delayed. Same food in 2 flights more same food in other 2 flights no WIFI or pleasant entertainment aboard. TAP crew looked scruffy and had a bad attitude from ground to aircraft. I learn on my round trip that Portuguese's passengers treat TAP like "Take Another Plane".

### TAP Portugal customer review
At check in on return from Lisbon they took our bags handed over our boarding passes and informed us that we - that is me my wife and our 6 and 3 year old daughters - were all seated separately. Yes that's right - they expected both my young daughters to sit away from their parents. All the check in assistant could say was "the flight is full - there is nothing I can do". Gate staff were pretty forceful in refusing to help also trotting out "the plane is full". When we resorted to swapping with some very kind fellow passengers an agitated steward could only say to me - "the plane is full". Surly insensitive unhelpful. Will not consider them ever again.

### TAP Portugal customer review
Lisbon - Warsaw - direct flight flight delayed 1 hr 45mins no information extremely rude staff on the ground once more an old aircraft. Crew this time more friendly but without experience lousy service the wine was good but the food awful. As I said before high fares in exchange a low cost service. I was totally in love with Lisbon and Portugal but next time I will flight via Swiss or Germany to avoid TAP Portugal flights.

### TAP Portugal customer review
Warsaw - Lisbon - direct flight horrible experience this is definitely a low cost company with high fares. No food on board awful crew old and dirty aircraft the ground service match the poor quality in the air. I hope low cost carries start to operate this route having this high fare company offering a low cost service at high prices need to end. easyJet offers a better service twice cheaper. Avoid TAP Portugal.

### TAP Portugal customer review
Do not fly TAP Economy (certainly not if you are towards the back of an A320) if you have legs: there is nowhere to put them! Even Ryanair has more legroom. Additionally they have redefined the meaning of "meal" to refer to a minuscule filled roll and an eggcup full of home made glue purporting to be a fruit drink. Avoid if you can.

### TAP Portugal customer review
Gatwick - Lisbon - Heathrow - spotless A319 outbound and A320 return and friendly competent crew. I've flown this route on TAP five times now and it's always been OK although the return flight was on a substitute aircraft as the first one was taken out of service. The delay was only about 20 mins. Sandwiches a bit basic but ice cold Sagres beer.

Flew to Porto from Amsterdam with a stop in Lisbon. On time with a nice crew and good food onboard. Both flights early and bags were delivered soon! Lisbon airport has some improvements and looks nicer so connecting there is a lot more confortable!

### TAP Portugal customer review
I fly with TAP about 5-6 times a year mainly on the Lisboa - London route. One of my main issues with them is their ground handling "Groundforce" in Lisboa. The flight information screens are not always updated or accurate and the check-in area is always overcrowded and disorganized! To make matters worse many of the check-in and gate agents are unprofessional and rude. Last week we were kept 15min inside a hot bus before it was dispatched to the aircraft. When we arrived at the aircraft a further 10min wait before the doors were open. The flight was over an hour late and the all male cabin crew looked scruffy and had a bad attitude!

### TAP Portugal customer review
I am a frequent flyer passenger with TAP. I flew from Lisbon to Geneva yesterday (2 pm flight October 22 2013). Only when we were on board did the announcement come that they were flying with a "minimum crew" and therefore there would be no on-board service. During the 2.5 hour flight they offered us a glass of water. I know this airline is in trouble financially but they could have announced the absence of service before people boarded (preferably at check-in) so that we could at least buy some food and coffee to take on board (Starbucks in the departure lounge for example). This has never happened to me before - on this or any airline.

London Heathrow to Lisbon. Service was fine at Heathrow and fine to Lisbon there was delay at Lisbon airport and at Miami due to air strike in France. The service could of been better to Miami only one choice of meal on long distance but two choices of meals coming back from Miami to Lisbon and not happy that you only get half a cup of coffee or tea. Price is ok but not when you pay for your inflight meals on all your trips. Staff at Lisbon airport was fine air stewardesses were not pleasant the male stewards were fine and helpful. I felt uncomfortable on the flights leg room was not good on flights to Miami the return was better.

October 5th from Seville to Caracas. Flying Seville to Lisbon first. Travelled with my 7 month old baby and my husband when we arrived in Seville the woman at check-in told us that there was something wrong with my ticket she told me my child appeared linked to my husband ticket and not mine. Told to fly to Lisbon and they would resolve my issue. In Lisbon I was told I had no ticket and that my son could fly with my husband but not me. I did not move from the front of the line when they told me they could not assist me it took almost 2 hours to solve my issue. A very impolite man came and gave me the boarding pass for my baby and me. I can not believe how we were treated and how difficult it was for them to put us on the plane we paid for. To top of it the food served during the flight was very poor.

### TAP Portugal customer review
Flew out of LIsbon to New Jersey on 10/8/13. We had one bag of checked luggage between the 3 of us. It was 6 kilos over. We were told it would cost 8 euros to check the bag. My husband took out 10 euros and the rep said to bring the cash to customer service. When we got to customer service we were told it was 80 euros not 8. We had to pay it because the bag had already been taken otherwise we would've emptied some things into our carry- ons. Keep in mind we had one checked bag between us. We were technically under weight! Next we were seated in the back of the aircraft so by the time the food cart came to us they were out of one selection. The other selection was awful. Our child ate barely anything. The snack brought later on was a dried out Swiss cheese sandwich that was inedible. Most passengers left it intact and sent it back. For $950 a ticket one would think the food would at least be edible. We won't be using TAP again. We've had a better experience on United and we can pick our seats.

February 2012 from Lisbon to Rome and vice-versa. The flights departed on schedule and the crews were excellent. On our returning flight the crew were very friendly. The meal on board the first flight was the thing I considered very poor: a cup of juice and some biscuits for a journey of 2.5 hrs. On my returning flight the situation was worse because TAP didn't serve any meals. The experience on board was ok: the aircraft A319 were clean and comfortable. An experience to repeat I hope.

Had a business class flight from Milan to Lisbon (1/10/13) was very nice. The cabin crew were friendly and always helped. The food was good for airline meals. Very efficient serving. No problem with the luggage. Got back to Zurich on 9/10/13 again business class. Very nice service as described before always refilled the glasses. The priority luggage is always the first which comes out. I always travel with TAP when I go to Portugal they still maintain a certain high lever which is very satisfactory.

### TAP Portugal customer review
It appears that TAP has made it a habit to announce no cabin service at the very last minute. Flew back to Germany from Lisbon. One hour delay at airport 3 hours flight and only a glass of water not even a coffee. It appears that they save the food and drinks for the return flight from Frankfurt to Lisbon. What do they mean with minimum cabin crew? There were 3 air stewards for 135 passengers. Still no service on board. Totally unacceptable. I will never fly with TAP again.

FRA-LIS 2013/09/08 LIS-Horta (Azores) 2013/09/13 back to FRA 2013/09/21 economy. Had booked the flight 10 months in advance scheduling was changed twice during the first 6 months. Had planned to fly back on Sept 20th flight from Horta to LIS was cancelled in April and would we change to fly from Ponta Delgada (350 km distance). We booked on the flight for the 21st and had to book (and pay of course) one night plus in our hotel. For the flight home we luckily did online check-in the day before where we learned that we were not booked on the flight. Phone call revealed that the flight we had originally booked had been re-established and carried out though and that they had booked us back on that plane without telling us so that we had unwillingly produced no- show some hours ago. Luckily there were still free seats on the plane for next morning so they booked us back and 5 minutes later we could proceed to our online check-in. Flights as such were okay food was rather good crew quite kind but I had to go myself to the rear and ask for water because nobody responded to the attendant's call. The captain on LIS-FRA very kindly invited us to the attention of a very clear nocturnal sight on Paris. IFE on small ceiling-hanged monitors ridiculous if you have no binoculars.

GIG-LIS. Another delay according to FlightStats TAP has a 80% delay score frequently and I suffer with many of them. Another disgraceful economic class flight the same food was served days before same old A330 airplane without wi-fi or any on demand service on board. The crew were young without any visible experience and unprofessional to many problems and mistakes lack of solutions to solve them. They spend all the time hidden chatting and laughing behind curtains. As a frequent flyer I saw TAP service getting worst flight after flight.

DUS-LIS. Flight from Dusseldorf to Lisbon got cancelled but no one told me about it. This situation is standard service by TAP. Its the third time this month TAP have cancelled and changed my flights without a warning. But the worst was to come TAP lost is sense of good service they are turning into a cheap low-cost”airline. TAP got me on an afternoon flight to Lisbon. Suddenly they announced we have to land in Hamburg and then we would leave for Lisbon! We all couldn't believe it now had to go back to Hamburg and then go to Lisbon. The plane to Lisbon wasn't full and when we landed in Hamburg people actually got off and new passengers got on it. So seems like we had to do the whole detour just to pick up more passengers. TAP is just a bus with wings. From Hamburg to Lisbon no food. Once more a poor service lack of communication and another delayed flight with TAP.

### TAP Portugal customer review
My wife and I flew LGW-LIS on 14/8/13 and returned LIS-LHR on 12/9/13. We have a house in Portugal and fly this route twice a year usually with TAP. As with all the other TAP flights we have taken in the past 5 years or so departure and was on time on both legs. The aircraft's were clean the cabin crew smart and reasonably friendly. The service provided was good. We know not to expect 4 star cuisine on European short-haul flights and the snack provided is quite acceptable. The seats and legroom are perfectly adequate. Lisbon Airport is now a joy to travel through with the recent improvements made. Contrast this with the shabby and overcrowded T1 at LHR!! The only downside is for some unknown reason the LGW-LIS flight is always parked at a remote corner of Lisbon airport necessitating a somewhat lengthy transfer by bus to the Terminal. I would always choose this airline in preference to Easyjet since once you factor in all the Easyjet 'options' there is usually not much difference in the price of the ticket.

### TAP Portugal customer review
I am flying frequently with TAP between Vienna and Lisbon. The flights themselves are usually unspectacular however the course on Sunday evening from VIE to LIS has a delay rate of 100% (everytime approximately an hour). In general flying TAP from Lisbon to anywhere with TAP has become a nightmare over the summer period: Chaotic check-in in LIS with huge crowds as TAP seems to be unable to deal with the amount of passengers they have during the summer season. Latest event: My wife flew today LIS-GVA-VIE. She was informed at check-in that the flight would be delayed 35min but that there would be no meal served to insufficient crew. She was not given a voucher or anything like that. In the end they were unable to find any crew at all the plane finally took off with more than 2 hours delay. Since at some point it got tight with the connecting flight she tried to get a place on a different flight (there was a direct one to Vienna more or less at the same time) at the transfer desk in Lisbon. Staff there were very unhelpful just telling her that they could do nothing and that she had to ask the ground staff in GVA for help not respecting repetitive information by wife that the flight she had to catch in GVA was the last one of the day to VIE. She only made that connecting flight thanks to the kind help of the ground staff of SWISS in GVA who picked her up at the plane from LIS and guided her directly to the gate for VIE. In a nutshell TAP Air Portugal should be renamed into Take Another Plane (at least if you have an alternative). I only use it since it is the only airline offering direct flights between VIE and LIS.

I travelled from London to Lisbon on Friday 12 September 2013 the flight was more than an hour delayed there was no food on the plane we were given vouchers to get food from Heathrow food shops. There were no space between the seats even though I was sitting at the aisle. If I wanted such service I would have booked a ticket with a low budget airline and not with TAP. On the return flight the flight was delayed only 45 min we were given food but they were short of staff so when one of the cabin crew from the business class willed to help his colleagues in economy he was told off by his other colleague and probably superior from the business class. If I was you I would think twice before I book with TAP Portugal again.

### TAP Portugal customer review
Disgraceful business class flight flight 346 from FNC to LGW on 14th September. No food or drink served for entire flight other than one small glass of water as they were operating to "minimum safety" standards. No warning prior to boarding so no chance to even get a sandwich and a bottle of water from the airport departure lounge. I understand that emergency staff shortages can and do arise however this has happened on several occasions recently and seems to be something more than just a shortage of one member of cabin crew. Flight arrived from Lisbon short crewed so the airline had several hours before the Gatwick flight departed to either arrange for another member of crew to join our flight or to make provision for passengers to be given a voucher for food/drink before departure or at the very least to make passengers aware of the situation on check-in so they could make their own arrangements to take food/water on board. The lack of communication was disgraceful. The entire episode was very poorly handled and not what one would expect from a national carrier airline. It's really not good enough when you pay a premium to not have to travel with a "no frills" airline and get less than basic service. Passengers have a choice of airlines on the Funchal - Gatwick route and TAP would be well advised to re- think some of their policies if they do not want to lose their market share of this route.

I have just travelled form Lisbon to Amsterdam and 5 minutes before boarding we were told there was no service on board. This is the second time this has happened to me on TAP. In June I flew from Zurich to Lisbon and was also told there was no service on board. I don't suppose TAP has ever heard of the word replacements so when one of the crew cannot make it then someone replaces them. TAP is the best advertisement for other airline companies. I shall do everything I can NEVER to fly TAP again. I am a frequent flier but can also get miles when I fly Lufthansa. I travel to Amsterdam every other month so I shall fly KLM. TAP has just lost another customer. I am appalled at the lack of care TAP gives to its customers.

GVA-LIS then LIS-RAK. I should have booked a low cost company. Onboard the crew did not smile. On top of that our seat had broken individual air conditioning thus we had all the air on our face. Requested a seat change however they definitely make us feel like a burden during the flight which was only 1.5 hrs long. Scheduled to fly back on Monday. Can't actually call it service but forced attendance!

### TAP Portugal customer review
Flight from Lisbon to Salvador (Brazil). We left on time but staff was very rude and never took care of the requests of the passengers. I asked for headphones but they took 2 hours to arrive and half an hour for a glass of water. The entertainment system was not working properly and some movies never started playing. The speakers were really bad and we could barely hear the announcements. The seats are old and quite uncomfortable. Food was ok and we arrived on time.

### TAP Portugal customer review
Flew from Zurich to Lisbon and then from Lisbon to Paris on a different trip. Zurich to Lisbon was the most uncomfortable flight I've been on (until the one from Lisbon to Paris). The seats are minuscule and legroom is non-existent. I'm 6'3 and my knees were unable to fit behind the seats large metal plates and brackets from the seat in-front of me on both flights were cutting into my legs. My legs literally had to be set all to one side and somewhat on top of the armrests in order to not have metal gouging my knees. My Wife is 5'4 and also had problems sitting in the seats without her knees hitting the metal plates on the seat in front of her. The 1st flight was only delayed 20 minutes. The flight from Lisbon to Paris we waited at the airport for 14 hours from the time we got there with minimal or no updates. Of-course when we got to Paris all of our bags were lost. But luckily we got the bags 3 days later. I will never fly TAP again.

Flight from Portugal to Brazil the seat had no working entertainment system when they came to me they had run out of all items except lasagne. The staff were rude and had no interest in solving the problems.

### TAP Portugal customer review
FNC-LIS-FNC. You should choose a low cost airline rather than this. The price paid does not reflect the service. Most of the time there won't be any meal due to their constant policy of flying with minimum crew. Can't understand why this happens but it seems to be a general policy of the company now. Flight attendants seem miserable and unhappy doing their job. It's incredible how much their service has decline in recent years mostly due to their comfortable monopoly of profitable routes. Avoid at all costs.

### TAP Portugal customer review
I flew GVA-LIS-ACC on 24 August business class. The first 2 hour sector was very average with no inflight entertainment (A319). Lounge in LIS ok but very busy. The problem was the LIS-ACC sector. Business class. The seats were economy 1970 style. I thought there must have been an equipment substitution but the crew informed me this was indeed Business class. Truly a 3rd world set up and I will avoid TAP at all costs in the future. Crew were disinterested and the food offering miserable even for economy. Someone needs to wake up in this airline's senior management.

### TAP Portugal customer review
LIG-LGW and LGW-LIS. 23rd August and 27th August respectively. As mentioned in many other reviews here there was an extremely long check-in queue with only two check-in desks open. The flight was over an hour delayed in departing. This was followed by a very long delay in luggage retrieval at Gatwick which to be fair might be more the disorganisation of Groundforce. Return flight on the 27th was appalling. I was probably one of the first people to check-in so did not know there was no inflight service available until we had been in the air for almost an hour. I had to virtually beg for a cup of water. What I would like to know is how TAP thinks it can hold on to its share of the market in this way. The Star Alliance has given them a huge advantage by using the names of other well-reputed airlines to sell tickets but I warn other to ensure that their Lufthansa flight is not run by Tap Portugal because the flight I took on that occasion was the worst flying experience I had ever had. This last experience has simply ensured that I will do my utmost to avoid flying with Tap again.

### TAP Portugal customer review
Lisbon - Barcelona (TP1048) - This particular flight is constantly delayed. Booked to depart at 20.30 on a regular basis leaves before 22.00. Its my 7th consecutive delay this year on this route and to be honest TAP Portugal have a serious problem with time. On this flight no information was provided first info comes at 21.00 the flight should leave at 21.30 then a second one putting the departure date at 22.00. The flight leaves at 22.40 arriving in Barcelona the next day. I leave the airport at 02.00 (expensive Taxi fare home). Onboard the staff were OK but keeping the low standard service. A simple excuse in Portuguese and in imperceptible English. The airplane was dirty and smelly and once more no food on board. For TAP Portugal frequent fliers its becoming a nightmare deal with constant delays bad service and no food on top overpriced tickets.

### TAP Portugal customer review
Manchester to Lisbon 7th August 2013. At check-in there were 2 very long queues. Near to the front of our queue the TAP staff just got up and walked away. What followed was further disarray as the other staff simply shrugged. Left to simply go to the very back of the remaining queue. On the return journey there was a similar case with half a dozen different flights merged into two queues which then resulted in 'emergency desks' being opened. Check-in took 2 hours on this occasion. Boarded on 07/08/2013 from Manchester to Lisbon. Departure time of 11.20am passed and we were delayed. No communication as to why. Then the cabin crew started to frantically count the passengers - with patchy information provided to individuals. Around 2 hours into this debacle passengers were each offered a small glass of water. 3 hours 10 minutes after proposed take off time we departed. No apology and no clarification given.

MIA-LIS-CPH 10/08/2013. MIA-LIS: Check-in was fine. Flight left on time. One of their older A330 with old interior. The person TV's didn't work. Flight time was 8 hours. Food was very good a choice between fish and pasta. I choose pasta and it was delicious. They came around with water during the flight breakfast was good as well. Landed on time at 5am. LIS-CPH: A320 Crew was very nice. Flight departed on time went smoothly. They served some kind of fish with mashed potato. Landed on time. Baggage was also very fast.

Worst airline I've travelled on. Flight Heathrow to Lisbon delayed missed connection issued connection flight to Funchal. Sent from Lisbon onto Porto more delays then Porto to Funchal 11.55pm had 5 mins to get flight told to run and as we took off the landing lights at runway were being switched off behind us! Then delays on 11 August 2013 3 hour delay at Lisbon to Heathrow. I think every TAP flight was delayed on departure board. No staff around so no proper info being given out.

TP2568 VCP-LIS on Aug 10th 2013. You pay a fortune for the worst service even a smile from the crew isn't included. Food served in economy is the worst I ever had (even for TAP standards) : dry bread for breakfast some cheesy fish for dinner. Inflight entertainment is a choice of 13 channels that play in loops (something I haven't seen on a flight for over 10 years). The only good thing is a bit of leg-space (better than some Air France Boeings) flying to Brazil. The ground personnel are not much better. Connecting flight to Brussels TP614 delayed 2 hours and they were not willing to put me on a Brussels Airlines flight that left in 60 mins even for a Star Alliance Frequent Flyer that I am! Result: 6 hours waiting at Lisbon Airport.

Flew CPH-LIS-EWR. First leg CPH-LIS: A319 nice comfortable seats friendly FAs. They served breakfast and it was some omelette with tomato sauce and mushrooms. For some it was tasty not for me. Flight was on time. Second leg LIS-EWR: Was planned as A340-300 got 3 hours delayed due to technical problem on engine. Very bad information at LIS about when flight was going to depart. Aircraft change to A330-200 old interior. Very bad food. Close to not being edible.

LGW-FNC 30th July 2013. I have to say I was dreading this flight after reading a number of reviews. I fly fortnightly on Business and regularly for pleasure and this was the first time we had used TAP. I was happily surprised by the service and quality of flight we received. As a regular traveller to Madeira from the UK it has become rather expensive to use so called low cost carriers and charters to the island so we turned to TAP in the hope they would be able to service our requirements and they far exceeded my expectations. Yes I agree their service could be improved by more presence in the cabin but the cabin crew were friendly and efficient. The leg room and seat space for a large build 6ft3 chap was brilliant for an economy seat. We boarded on time however 25 minutes late leaving LGW due to heavy traffic. Overall a really positive experience and looking forward to the return later in August.

### TAP Portugal customer review
AMS-OPO (TP651 on 25/7/2013) and OPO-AMS (TP652 on 29/7/2013). Inbound flight delayed 1hr 35mins for a 2hr 38mins flight. Outbound flight delayed 30 minutes. Delays are constant on this route. The last 10 flights I flew on this route were all delayed. The explanation was always the same: "late arrival of the aircraft" which really is no explanation whatsoever as to say that the flight is late because the aircraft is late amounts to say nothing at all. The delays led to the loss of takeoff/landing slots and/or to the allocation of the farthest takeoff/landing runaway in Schiphol which adds to the delays and is frustrating to the passengers. Priority luggage at the arrival of the aircraft in Amsterdam was delivered last compounding the delay. Boarding was chaotic with everyone boarding simultaneously and queues not being respected both in OPO and AMS. Aircraft on this route (Fokker-100) are old and outdated. TAP Portugal is expensive (flight costs are those of a premium airline while the service is certainly not) inefficient and its on-time performance is appalling. Although the food is decent in the business cabin the service is nothing special with attitude shown from both the cabin crew and the handling staff. It is dangerously placed in an airline limbo: its service is slightly better than a low cost - food/drinks and newspapers are provided - but its cost is that of a premium airline. However delays are a constant. All in all it would not be a sustainable airline if it did not have the advantage of the de-facto monopoly in certain routes. Not recommended.

### TAP Portugal customer review
My flight yesterday was from Brussels to Marrakech - connecting in Lisbon. Initial flight out was delayed causing us to miss our connecting flight to Marrakech which was the last flight and only flight into Marrakech out of Lisbon airport. The whole situation was preventable had the airport staff skipped us to the front of the customs line or even moved us to the European passport line. We waited in the US passport line for 30 minutes - while there was no wait in the European passport line. When I explained to staff that I was going to miss my flight he responded that the TAP Portugal flight had been delayed 30 minutes so I would still make my flight. When I got to the gate the plane was there but the gate was closed. In fact the flight was not delayed 30 minutes rather they waited an extra 10 minutes for late passengers but apparently not for us. The TAP customer service rep was rude and incompetent. She gave us bad instructions on retrieving our luggage and it took us almost 3 hours to get our suitcases. We arrived at Lisbon airport at 2.15 - by the time we dealt with all the unfortunate nonsense it was almost 6pm before we got in a cab. TAP Portugal's standards of service are unacceptable.

Portugália Airlines: Ancient aircraft lateness and worn out wobbly seats - Portugalia is for you. Stewardesses were very good. Flew Manchester to Lisbon. Booked to fly on TAP but they decided to shunt us onto their poor relation. Ridiculous delays and poor aircraft experience (Fokker 100). Worn out seats and broken fittings. Will go out of my way to make sure next time we fly to Lisbon that we avoid Portugalia - or TAP for that matter.

### TAP Portugal customer review
Check in at LGW agent did not even greet me took my passport tagged my bag and that was the extent of the exchange. Boarding was on time however my seat (6B) was still in a business call setting so I had to call a steward over to sort this out which she did but then I had to find my own head rest which was under the seat. Lunch was so poor I wish they had not bothered with it. Flight arrived early and we were off quickly. Poor service flight attendants not interested and unfortunately this is not the Air Portugal service that I use to know and I hope that this will change soon.

Portugália Airlines: LIS-BRU on a Fokker 100. Departure slightly delayed. Aircraft was dated there were no information monitors but seats were comfortable although space under the seats could be bigger. Crew was friendly but the meal consisted only of a turkey and cheese sandwich accompanied by a fruit drink however this was a mid- afternoon flight of 2 hours 40 minutes so there is no need for a fancy meal.

### TAP Portugal customer review
FNC-LIS-FNC. There is a recurring issue when flying with this airline which is the cabin crew. More than usual they are flying with ‘minimum cabin crew’ which actually means you won't get served any meal whatsoever. Not even a cup of water don't mind asking. Cabin crew more than surly seems absent minded and just don't care about passengers. I'm a frequent flyer and I always get the feeling I'm a burden to them. Low cost carriers offer much better product. Unfortunately for some routes they got the exclusive monopoly. Don't mind complaining too they won't read or reply.

Flight delayed 2 hours from Prague to Lisbon. Arrived at midnight. I missed my connecting TAP Portugal flight to Faro. I was sent to a hotel without my luggage. I was given a boarding pass for the next day at 22:30 which is unacceptable. I also had a hotel booked in Faro for one night which I obviously missed yet still paid for. I went to the airport at 05.00 to reclaim my baggage and was denied it. I managed to get transferred onto the morning flight at 09.45. Changed gate almost 5 times before passengers commenced boarding. In the process of boarding flight was cancelled. I asked for food vouchers which they very nearly refused to give us. Waited at baggage claim for our luggage for over 4 hours! My bag in the end did not appear. Finally a bus arrived and I made it to my destination at 22:30. Return flight from Faro to Lisbon was fine. Arrived at noon. Flight from Lisbon to Prague was scheduled at 14.45 delayed until 16.15. Then delayed another hour and another and another. No concrete information given. They were understaffed and short 2 cabin crew members. Stayed in the airport until 21.30 and 9.5 hours later we finally boarded the flight to Prague with no in-flight meal. Landed in Prague at 02.30.

28th June TP331 London Gatwick to Porto. 12th July TP332 Porto to London Gatwick. Traveled twice with TAP in last 2 weeks. Have flown many times for both business and leisure both short and long haul. I have to say TAP is probably the worst airline that I have come across. Late seems to be the norm with no information about the cause and no real apology. Blaming a "late inbound aircraft" is not really an explanation - after all its their fleet. Cabin crew surly and unfriendly. Choose another carrier if you can would be my advice.

Had two flights LIS-LHR and a Portugalia (Tap owned) MAD-LIS recently. TAP flight was steady great pilot. Delay of 30mins solved and arrived on time. Meal: ok for such short flight A320 is not a plane that I like a lot but its ok. Service with a smile. Portugalia's flight was on a Fokker 100 and I liked it a lot. Plane looks less cramped than the A320. Good service helpful crew. In check with PGA normal service. Smooth flight. Luggage: no problems.

FAO-LIS-Helsinki. TP 1912 and TP796. 8/7/2013. During the last month I have had 4 flights with TAP. Delays seem to be business as usual. But the thing that really amazes me is the unfriendliness of the cabin crew. Are they trained to be stiff and impolite? What would a smile and a friendly positive attitude towards the customers cost? Now the basic feeling on the flights has been that the customers are only irritating nuisances.

Lisboa - Sao Paulo - Flight overbooked! (Maybe that's why on-line check was not working). As a regular Silver passenger I have to wait 45 minutes to be confirmed on the flight. Once more the flight departed with a two hours delay. Food OK Very young friendly crew but the old supervisors not friendly. Every month I have a transcontinental flight with TAP the feeling I have is: "they are doing us a favor. Flights are much more expensive and the service is everyday poor.

### TAP Portugal customer review
Sao Paulo - Lisboa - once more the flight was overbooked consequently delayed. Ground staff was horrible. This time I don't have any luck and catch one of the worst cabin crews in life. Food was served like a campus without option for the first time I skipped a meal on a transatlantic flight. I prefer to starve to eat such crap many around do the same. Cabin crew do not offer an option. Breakfast service was poor. TAP abuses a dominant position we don't have any other option to cross the Atlantic to Brasil. This explain the highly prices (3400 euros) in economy and the poor service.

LIS-MUN. Flight delayed 3 hours no service provide on the ground remember Lisbon Airport is the main hub for TAP. Boarding by bus old A320 with the interior dirty old and smelly. No food drinks or snack served on board due to "one missing cabin crew". On the way back the flight was operated by the Star Alliance partner Lufthansa A321 a superb flight experience like should be always.

### TAP Portugal customer review
Flew from HAM to LIS 29/6/2013 and return a week later in Economy. Flight from HAM was delayed 3 hours no service was provided during the flight because of lack of staff (official explanation). Since it was a day after the general strike in Portugal I thought this might be bad luck. Return flight slightly delayed and again no service on board because of "lack of staff". This information came together with the boarding announcement so no chance to stock up provisions before boarding. After reading other comments my impression is that this is corporate policy although TAP does not claim to be a low-cost airline and is certainly charging significantly more than LC carriers. Definitely not recommendable.

As a regular traveller AGP/LIS/FNC I am left with no choice but to fly TAP This must be the worlds worst airline for lost bags late flights and missed connections.

### TAP Portugal customer review
Tried to fly LHR-LIS-FAO: after checking in at Heathrow saw a delay on the screen and departure time pushed back and back. Finally found the one representative (trying to cover 45-odd airlines) and was told the flight was late as the incoming flight had to unexpectedly land at Gatwick. When we did take off 3 hours late there was no running water in the loos or to make hot drinks with. Offered a seat on the next Faro flight as I'd missed the connection but it was 7 hours later. I said I would rather drive as that took only 2 hours cue much head- scratching about the craziness of this when a meal voucher was on offer. Took over an hour to get my bag back. Then came the return flight from Lisbon - longest queue I have ever ever seen to check in even longer queue for security. Flight was over an hour late taking off for no particular reason. Will never fly TAP again no matter how cheap they are.

Flew to Oporto from Gatwick as part of package holiday with Titan Holidays 18/06/13. Warned at check in flight 70 minutes late which apparently is quite usual and to have something to eat before the flight as the food is minimal and awful. Good advice as light snack was very dry bread roll with plastic ham. Staff were not very friendly and carried out a minimum service. On positive side Oporto airport very spacious and efficient. Return flight 26/6/13 on time better service but still the dry bread roll.

### TAP Portugal customer review
Checked in for a scheduled flight from Miami to Lisbon and on to Manchester UK. Flying Executive (Business) with departure scheduled for 16.30 Mon 3rd June. Waited with no information in lounge until 21.00 when agency staff arrived to collect our bags as we were going to be taken to a hotel for the night. Provided with adequate accommodation and dinner and breakfast. Taken back to airport at 12.00 noon when were rechecked onto the supposedly repaired aircraft and a connection from Lisbon to Manchester. Scheduled take off 15.00. At 14.25 asked the lounge staff to confirm if we needed to go to the gate as the Departures board had not changed. They had no information and could not get a reply by telephone from TAP so we were advised to go straight to the Gate. No TAP staff there and very few passengers. Went back with other passengers to the Check-in Desks which were simply chaotic. Offered seats on an alternative flight by BA but warned by other passengers that BA were not honouring TAPs tickets. This was because of the difference in value and even after wasting an hour walking round the airport with a TAP staff member the best we could get was an economy ticket in exchange for our TAP Club equivalent. Ended up paying 650$ extra for World Traveller Plus upgrade so we could at least sit together on what was a full flight. Finally departed 28+ hours late. Claim going in to TAP. Whilst the outbound flight was on time TAP's idea of Executive Class is a joke.

Porto via Lisbon to Casablanca in May 2013. The 19 seater plane (Beechcraft 1900) was overbooked and I was selected to stay aground but told so only after all other passengers had boarded. No possibility therefore to find any candidates among other passengers willing to take compensation and stay an additional night in LIS. Poor communication from handling officers and ground staff made for frustrated feelings and a spoiled trip.

CPH-LIS return. Flights on time seating was OK and legroom with no worries even if I am tall and overweight. A hot meal was served (a very positive surprise) it wasn't to my taste but other passengers really enjoyed it so I cannot complain. Only thing that annoyed me was the cabin crew who spoke very bad English and an attitude that made me feel as if passengers were a major source of trouble to them. Entertainment options on this 3 hour flight was equal to zero. Altogether I got an OK flight but TAP should really Work hard on learning their staff what service attitude is all about.

Milan-Lisbon return. This route is usually quite expensive but I managed to find an excellent deal with TAP. MXP- LIS: quite old A320 old style but extremely comfortable seats cabin crew very professional. A small sandwich was served with a good selection of beverages and spirits. Landed in Lisbon before schedule. LIS-MXP: very early morning flight completely full. Many passengers with connections at Malpensa on the way to China. Again Airbus A320. We were served breakfast which was quite satisfying in my opinion: a slice of cake some fruit and a yoghurt. Coffee tea and a wide range of juices available. No smile from cabin crew one of them was even rude with customers. Good value for money but I would recommend TAP to reconfigure and update their internal seats: they are yes comfortable but extremely old-style. The price paid was extremely good.

London Gatwick - Funchal return. Internet check in was a breeze 48 hours before departure. Bag drop at LGW was handled quickly and courteously and although TAP's website stated only one cabin bag was permitted I was allowed to take on a small cabin bag and laptop. Aircraft was an A320 less than half full. Pushback on time and flight time about 3 hrs 15 mins. Cabin crew were friendly albeit largely invisible after breakfast which was a very small savoury roll and yoghurt drink. No personal IFE drop down screens every 4th or 5th row showed a few programs but mostly flight mapping. Return journey from FNC lunchtime departure on a half full A319 pushback 10 minutes early. Snack size hot pasta and fruit puree dessert served midway through the flight. Otherwise pretty much as per the outward journey.

On time arrived early a bit no-frills in terms of the plane interior with blue leather seats that looked ragged and about a decade old (which contrasts quite a bit with the beautiful staff uniforms) but they were comfortable enough for 2 hour flights. Considering the price paid I was expecting a bit more in the way of food - not just a no-choice sandwich even on an early morning flight but at least the coffee was good and you could have as much as you wanted and anything else you wanted to drink. The staff at the TAP office in central Lisbon were very accommodating and friendly.

Scheduled to fly Boston to Ponta Delgada 10 May in business class. Our connecting flight from ABQ was cancelled due to equipment failure with the result that we could not reach Boston in time to make this flight. We phoned Air Portugal's 800 number from the ABQ airport and the call was routed to Portugal. Their reservations staff could not have been less helpful. Because a travel agent had made our booking they insisted that only she could change or cancel it. I explained that she was at a funeral out of state but they insisted that the rule was the rule and would not help me schedule another flight. They did say that another flight would cost us $2600 per person when she scheduled the change. We cancelled our trip.

Flew GRU-OPO-ORY in business class on A332. The seat is not full flat crew were harsh when dealing with passengers. This was my third transcontinental flight with TAP left feeling that they are doing us a favor. Really an inferior service and rude! I do not recommend!

We flew TAP from Casablanca to Lisbon last Sunday. The flights in the afternoon were all cancelled. We missed all our connecting flights to Malta the next day. The only food we were given on the flight to Lisbon was a packet of peanuts. The only food on the flight from Lisbon to UK was a ham and cheese roll. We won't be recommending TAP.

Lisbon-Geneva in an A320. Smooth and friendly check-in (TP web check-in wouldn't work for a connecting flight on Swiss another Star Alliance airline). Our baggage was sent through to Athens. Boarding was by bus - there was a long draughty wait on the bus in the cold weather. Once on board the service was polite and efficient the seats were reasonably comfortable and a good small breakfast was served. The flight arrived a little early.

London Gatwick to Lisbon on an A319. Apart from a 15 minute delay and a rather chaotic disembarkation process in Lisbon (bussed to terminal) this was a pleasant flight. A tasty roll was served with alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages the plane was clean and comfortable and the crew friendly.

Miami-Lisbon Business Class Seat 2A. Got to Miami Airport early enough to enjoy the Biz Class lounge. Check in was a breeze. The lounge could have been much better. Lisbon's TAP Biz Class lounge is much more superior. Boarding was on time and I was greeted by a Flight attendant who immediately took my coat. Offered champagne. Flight upfront was quite light with 15 of us. Offered amenity kit menus and noise cancelling headsets prior to take off. Once in the air drink service started followed by dinner consisting of table setting with appetizer salad with garnishes soup and an entree. I took the fish that surprisingly was delicious. Prior to landing a cold breakfast was served. Landed in LIS 30 minutes early off the airplane first and retrieved my suitcase. Flight was very nice on a newly reconfigured A330 with LED lights. Seat was comfortable and crew were superb.

LGW-OPO return. As a Star Alliance gold card holder one of the reasons I chose to travel with TAP was the possibility of lounge access. Unfortunately this was not forthcoming at LGW where I was told that only members of the TAP loyalty scheme are allowed access. Flight out okay on time poor food but legroom at front of the economy cabin good. Lounge in OPO allowed access with good facilities flight back on time food again poor and much less legroom in row 9. Overall if TAP are not recognising Star Alliance cards I will fly with Easyjet in future.

### TAP Portugal customer review
São Paulo-Lisbon. Once more the flight was delayed but this is standard with TAP Portugal. Staff on board were very unprofessional boarding chaotic with cabin crew ignoring passengers no help with baggage coats or senior passengers. Airplane was old with refurbished interior already collapsing. TAP is definable on is decline level of service. Food cold and dry and no options to change. Cabin Crew spend 80% of the time chatting behind a curtain. Arrival at Lisbon airport was chaotic with long queues.

### TAP Portugal customer review
EWR-AGP by way of LIS. March 18 outbound. Unremarkable flight. Left on time and arrived a bit early. A330 with okay entertainment. Decent meal service but the snack promised near landing never appeared. We arrived early morning in LIS and were never offered coffee. That seemed odd to me but all else okay. My partner forgot a package on board the plane and crew helped retrieve it before we changed planes. Transfer made easily. Return AGP-EWR with an overnight layover in LIS. Chose this flight because was $1000 cheaper each than others making the overnight hotel bill acceptable. All flights on time. Return LIS-EWR on A340 and much better entertainment. Crew excellent all legs.

### TAP Portugal customer review
FRA-LIS-SSA. Generally much better than expected. Connections both ways were easy and on-time seats and cabin were same as usual (it was a new A330) meals very good staff realistically friendly rather than over the top and also good value. Improvements? Why not inform transit passengers before landing of the Gate Numbers for connections (as Lufthansa)? Notices at LIS could be improved for transit passengers.

### TAP Portugal customer review
Flew TAP Portugal from LHR to LIS after being rebooked by British Airways after missing our connecting flight. The members of our party were pleasantly surprised by the professional personalities of the crew. The meal was surprisingly generous a small sandwich and a fruit smoothie along with complimentary soft drinks wine and beer (much more than we were used to in the USA where a 4 hour leg will barely get you a cup of water). The plane arrived on time. The flight was much better than anticipated and we may fly TAP again from the USA to LIS instead of British Airways via LHR.

### TAP Portugal customer review
LIS-EWR (Newark US) on A330 aircraft in Business class. TAP BIS class on long haul flights is dreadful. This was my second time flying on TAP long haul and will never do that again! IFE system seemed to work sporadically to not at all. The cabin crew disappeared after meal service and hid behind the galley curtain chatting. Not once did a flight attendant ask if everything was ok or offer any beverages. BIS class appeared to be filled mainly by what appeared to be TAP crew for the return flight. The food was ok not bad but not great. Flight attendant was rude and without any customer service skills. I had to get up and go to galley to beg for a bottle of water. Both times was asked to go to my seat and they would bring me one! They did a half hour later.

### TAP Portugal customer review
A fantastic flight from Lisbon to Amsterdam with a crew who were attentive and communicative towards passengers. Although it was an afternoon flight instead of the usual snack that most European airlines serve on short haul flights TAP provided a small but warm meal which was unexpected and tasty. I believe this was one of the better flights I had within Europe and I will recommend TAP!

### TAP Portugal customer review
FAR-LIS-FCO-LIS-FCO-FAR. Faro to Lisbon did not see the staff they hid behind the curtain until landing. Lisbon to Rome flight delayed 4 hours no explanation given once onboard. On arrival luggage was lost along with 20 other passengers. 2 hour wait before being seen at lost luggage. Luggage arrived 36 hours later. Rome to Lisbon flight delayed 40 minutes. Once at departure gate aircraft was now leaving from a different gate no information given. Watching the TAP representative at the gate was painful it took her over 35 minutes to check-in 115 passengers. Once on board nowhere to store luggage due to all overhead lockers been laden with oversized bags. Tried to use half empty overhead locker used for staff but was refused. Hand luggage placed on lap. No explanation for late running of aircraft. Piece of luck on arriving at Lisbon Faro flight delayed by 45 minutes so did not miss Faro connection. Food onboard is a joke especially when my ticket was 333 euros. Also note that passengers who use TAP seem to check-in 30 kilo plus bags so expect a long wait at check-in.

### TAP Portugal customer review
Recife - Lisbon (TP0012). Once more the flight was delayed in-flight service very poor only one meal was served on a 10 hr flight. Rude staff on board always absent when someone ask a favor. Flight entertainment poor no big options. The arrival at Lisbon airport was chaotic long queues ground staff screaming ignoring passengers. Many passengers losing connections flights. Ticket was overpriced.

### TAP Portugal customer review
Perfect Flight from Porto - Lisbon and return. Bumpy due to very small plane. Staff disappeared all flight. Didn't hear from Pilots until approaching Lisbon. Apart from that good company to fly with.

### TAP Portugal customer review
Flight from OPO - Moscow (DME). Perfect crew very helpful and entertaining. Pilots not too informative. A Good food and drink service. I was sat near some rude passengers the crew noticed that and offered me an empty row where I could lay and sleep a while. I more than recommend this company.

### TAP Portugal customer review
Having read all the reviews we were very dubious about flying with TAP. I can only say positive thinks about the whole experience. We travelled business class short haul to Funchal the plane left on time and arrived 20 minutes early. Our bags were first off and all together. The service on board was excellent as was the quality standard and presentation of the food. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff. I can't find anything to fault with the service today.

### TAP Portugal customer review
LIS-GIG. Old 330. Seat 1J. Worst IFE in Business Class than most of Economy Class existing on the market. Very rude staff who spent most of the 10hr flight laughing together. After the 1st drink they disappeared foe 1.5 hrs. Part of the menu was just not available and other options had so little quantities that they became unavailable. I could not find my headphones when requested to return them - I was accused of having stolen them. I flew more than 40 times on C class between Brazil and Portugal this was just the worst cabin crew I've faced.

### TAP Portugal customer review
We have travelled to Funchal with TAP for the past 12 years and it has been an excellent experience. Their service when we usually travel in the winter is excellent - a good choice of flights and highly competitive prices for a scheduled service. There is no scramble for seats and the whole process from booking in to boarding is well organised particularly for someone like myself who is disabled. The in-flight service is exactly right for what is a short flight of under four hours.

### TAP Portugal customer review
MIA-LIS: old-ish A330. Video barely worked and audio was broken. Food quality was poor and to our surprise it was even worse on the return leg (LIS-MIA) where we were served an aluminium foil container with parboiled rice and a few cubes of chicken a barely-edible fish spread and a totally unpalatable desert. LIS- MIA: newer A330. Better entertainment system except that audio was broken (again) and cheap earphones just didn't work. Cabin service was minimal. Meal was quickly cleared and crew disappeared for the rest of the 10 hour flight only to re-emerge to serve a snack. If you were thirsty you could go to the back where a flight attendant with an attitude poured you half a cup of water.

### TAP Portugal customer review
Newark to Lisbon in business class then on to Funchal in coach plus. Returned from Lisbon to Miami. Service and food quality on outbound portion from Newark was much better than on return to Miami. Quality and service seems to be luck of the draw and inconsistent. I booked the flights 8 ght months in advance and originally booked Miami to Lisbon on the outbound portion. They cancelled the outbound flight from Miami but did not notify me. I found out 5 days before departure by calling the airline to reconfirm everything. Fortunately I was able to rebook out of Newark for the same day of departure although this entailed an 8 hour layover in Lisbon for the continuing flight on to Funchal. The only other glaring negative was the food service on the return portion from Lisbon. The food was really poor. Priority" luggage came off the airplane last in Miami. I would fly TAP again only if my destination was in Portugal. Otherwise it's at the bottom of the barrel for European carriers in my opinion.

### TAP Portugal customer review
10/12/12 Lisbon-Rio De Janeiro Business Class. Big disappointment. Flight delayed for over 1 hr but this is standard with TAP. Check-in agent didn't bother to explain why just said that they changed departure time for today. Lounge in Lisbon was crowded food was gone as well. Boarding chaotic with many ground staff walking around the cabin with boxes paperwork chatting with cabin crew ignoring passengers no help with baggage coats etc. Food was ok edible if you were not missed while giving trays. Despite having wine list stewardess poured the one she had open on a drink cart! Some dishes were served still with foil wraps on. I was asked to pass every single item of china cutlery and food to passenger seating next to me felt like me being cabin crew. Everything looked rushed without any attention to detail. Cabin crew were not interested in any kind of conversation or smile. Seat was ok but not fully reclined which is ok on day flights. IFE very old with no AVOD only 6 movies (you can not even stop them) and a map. Generally not worth the money. TAP on European flights is better than most of the airlines on long haul way below!

### TAP Portugal customer review
Brussels-Lisbon-Miami-Lisbon-Brussels. Outbound trip ok - flights on time we made the connecting flight and although the snacks and food were nothing special they were still ok. Cabin crew could have been friendlier. Baggage was on time and I was a happy traveller. The long haul flight was with an older plane but it still had the small screens for every seat and they provided some entertainment. Flights back were a different story. Flight from Miami to Lisbon departed almost 2 hours later and the crew assured us they would do everything to get us to the connecting flight which was supposed to leave an hour after the first one should have landed. We went to the services desk got our food vouchers and were forced to wait another 6 hours for the next flight. Lisbon airport is a fairly uncomfortable airport to wait around at connecting flight was of course late and they switched gates so after we finally arrived I was exhausted. Crew on our way back was more friendly though. I would use them again.

### TAP Portugal customer review
Took an outbound Long haul flight from São Paulo to Lisbon. I learnt while checking in that the airport does not have a Lounge or any type of restaurant in the Boarding area meaning that all services are being delivered in the overcrowded Public area. Only 3 small Food areas which were packed so no seats available all power connections for laptops were occupied waited 30 minutes to get my food and had to eat it standing. The service on board (economy) is poor a scarce meal is served during the first 2 hours and then for 6 hours staff (not friendly) get to rest and only show up 1 hour before landing to serve a snack. The same during day time on the Flight LIS-SP.

### TAP Portugal customer review
Budapest-Lisbon and back both on A320. Though my first flight was 2 hours late the crew and service was nice two rounds of drinks served. The seats were comfortable. The flight back left Portugal on time the food was exactly the same as on my previous one.

### TAP Portugal customer review
Flew from Copenhagen to Faro via Lisbon. We were seated in the first row and both felt very uncomfortable in the cramped space. After and hour we were served a hot meal. No drinks offered before or after take off. Had to ask for more during dinner. Other seats in business class occupied by deadheaded crew. From LIS to Faro we were offered a glass of juice or water. Nothing else.

### TAP Portugal customer review
Lisbon to Heathrow in Sep 2012 with onward flight to Glasgow. First I was bumped off my booked flight with inadequate explanation. Made to wait for an hour despite turning up on time to have cancellation of seat confirmed and booked on a later flight. Was reassured I would make my re-arranged connection. However TAP announced a delay to the second flight Lisbon departure making it very tight to make the next BA connection. Pointed this out to them but treated in a very off-hand fashion and told there would be no problem. This second flight was further delayed taking off and after landing at Heathrow took 30 to 40 mins bringing up the steps. I told flight staff but complete disinterest. They also lost my luggage for both this and the outward flight to Lisbon for 3 days. Missed connection to Glasgow and therefore the last evening flight to Glasgow. Went immediately searching for TAP staff but they had all left. Had to book a hotel at my own expense overnight and sort out rebooking BA flight in the morning to Glasgow. TAP customer care is absolutely dreadful.

### TAP Portugal customer review
I have travelled AGP-LIS-FNC 5 times in the last 3 years and we have yet to enjoy a satisfactory flight. The flights are never on time so you miss your connection and you lose your baggage. The TAP information desk at Lisbon is under manned and twice I have queued 90 mins to get assistance the catering is a joke last September we received a biscuit and a bottle of water for lunch. This is the worst airline I have ever flown on but unfortunately I have no alternative because TAP are the only airline that fly the route.

### TAP Portugal customer review
Berlin - Lisbon - Sal Island and back Praia - Lisbon - Berlin. TAP has much improved in recent one or two years. Nice onboard service with really good food (actually for Economy standards I might even say excellent food). Flights outbound were on time (as there is also some tough competition for Sal island). Backwards from Praia the usual delay of one hour or so nevertheless flight connection was working. Seats still old and only basic in flight entertainment. But in general I really enjoyed the flights.

### TAP Portugal customer review
BSB-LIS-ROM and ROM-LIS-GRU last month in economy. All flights no exceptions were delayed one connection was missed and we were denied boarding even though there was still time available. This airline is disorganized and what they do best is to exempt themselves from any responsibility whatsoever in delays - they're never to blame! In some flights the temperature was unacceptably cold and despite requests (including from other passengers) flight attendants did not raise the temperature. Value for money is not acceptable and I will never choose this airline again.

### TAP Portugal customer review
Newark to Lisbon on Airbus A330. Check in was quick and pleasant. Attendant confirmed our kosher meal request. Since the flight was not full we asked to change our seat to the middle section so we would have empty seats between us and it was done quickly and cheerfully. Also given boarding passes for our next flight from Lisbon to Malaga on Portugalia a TAP subsidiary. Boarding started on time. As Continental silver elite we were able to board early. Plane was nice and clean seating was 2x4x2. My carry on fit in the overhead bin. Legroom and seat width were about the same as coach on other airlines. Armrest on the aisle side goes up. The seats were pretty comfortable the seat belts extremely long and there was even a foot rest. Blankets and pillows for each person. Blankets were needed for the first half of the flight which was very cold. Although we pushed back for an on-time takeoff we were delayed thereafter because of runway traffic for about 30-40 minutes. After takeoff the entertainment system was turned on. There was personal video with touch control. About 8 recent movies other foreign language films TV shows games and other stuff. Once we reached cruising altitude the food service began. Our kosher food was brought to us early to the right seat even though our seat was changed at check in. Overall it was a good flight.

### TAP Portugal customer review
Miami to Amsterdam via Lisbon. Departed on-time unfortunately we again had an old plane. On this flight my TV screen did not work at all. The crew did what they could but it still didn't work. Inflight entertainment really needs an upgrade. The meals were decent and we made an on-time arrival in Lisbon where we had 1 hr transfer. Long lines at security and it took a long time to get through. Luckily the flight waited for us and after 20 mins we departed. After that an announcement 'no commercial service on this flight' I didn't know what this meant but that became clear there was no service or drinks at all! I didn't see any crew members during the 2 hour flight! Very disappointing.

### TAP Portugal customer review
Used four times now and have to say the service is consistent - bored unhelpful staff and 3 late flights. These have been either LGW or LHR to Lisbon. On the last flight I witnessed a steward ignore an elderly gentleman who couldn't find overhead locker space. A disgrace.

### TAP Portugal customer review
LHR-LIS-LHR in economy both flights on A320s. Outbound checked in online and found no queue at the baggage drop off point. Very friendly check-in agent who gave our bags 'Priority' stickers for no apparent reason. Boarding was 20 minutes late with no explanation but still managed to push back on time. Seat comfort and leg room fine for a 2hr flight. Drop down TV's had something showing but with no sound or headphones it was lost on me. Free meal was a decent sandwich and fruit drink along with a choice of another complimentary drink (incl. alcohol). Cabin crew were professional my partner left his mobile phone on board which was discovered by an FA after everyone had alighted the aircraft. FA then ensured that the bus to the terminal didn't leave until she had found the owner of the phone. Return flight - check-in bag drop and onboard service and comfort as outbound but the flight was delayed 2hrs with no apologies or explanations given. Boarding was chaotic - the usual case of too much 'large' hand luggage causing problems for everyone else on what was a very full flight. Overall an excellent experience outbound and a disappointing return flight due mainly to poor communications and the chaos of boarding but I'd give them another chance.

### TAP Portugal customer review
Not the best of experiences Oct/Nov 2012 (HEL-LIS and LIS-HEL). We had golf bags with us which required a lot of interaction with customer service. Unfortunately there was just one person working at the desk with queues of 10s of metres. The cabin (A319) was old fashioned with sweaty leather seats and worn out equipment. The food was ok. The return was also similar with lots of waiting for just to pay our golf bags. Return flight was delayed and just a part of the customers luggage was loaded into the plane to make it in time to Helsinki.

### TAP Portugal customer review
Very pleasant flight from Dusseldorf to Lisbon. A hot meal was served for free also hot and cold drinks including beer and wine. Free newspapers and TAP magazine. Plane very clean staff friendly and helpful. Overall a very satisfying experience with TAP Portugal. Good value for money!

### TAP Portugal customer review
LHR-LIS-CMN-LIS-LHR. Each leg was late by up to 90 min with no explanation. Except London all planes were parked on the apron rather than at the gate which led to additional delays. Food was ok. Would only use again if I had no regard to my time.

### TAP Portugal customer review
We had 2 transatlantic flights with 2 different planes. One was quite new with great entertainment system and on demand movies and so on the other one was old with old seats and bad inflight entertainment with no personal movie selection. The service was bad. Pressing the call button creates no reaction whatsoever I had 3 flight attendants walking by without even looking at me even the light was on. The other time no one came and I asked a flight attendant if I could get something to drink. The answer was something like you can go to the back and get your drink yourself we don't do any service anymore. At Lisbon Airport we had less than 1 hour to make our connection. There was mayhem hundreds of people lining up for passport inspection. No one from TAP who made sure that the people with tight connections would be pulled through priority. Also at security no one from TAP to help. We barely made our connection without any help from the airline.

### TAP Portugal customer review
Warsaw-Lisbon. Flight delayed 45 mins due to late arrival of inbound flight. Comfortable A320 good legroom clean. Cabin crew fine some nice and smiling some grumpy and not interested in anything. Unlike most of the airlines TAP still serves some food on its flight we got a tray with small salad hot raviolis chocolate cake condiments. Nice Portuguese wines. Good language skills both cabin and flight crews. Bags arrived 20 mins after arrival.

### TAP Portugal customer review
Lisbon-Zurich on 21 October on A321. Online check-in worked smoothly as did the bag-drop where my case was sent through to Melbourne on two other airlines without any hassles. Hard to find the lounge which is in a remote corner of Terminal 1 with very limited signage. Comfortable seating and good food but was rather dark. After boarding the plane was held for 25 mins for ATC reasons - no drink offered to Business passengers. After take-off service was pleasant and a good meal was offered. The seat was comfortable.

### TAP Portugal customer review
LIS-BRU-LIS. Great flights. Mobile check-in worked fine both ways. Fast lane for safety control in Lisbon so no queuing. Seating was good and plenty of leg room. An old style aircraft seats are a bless. A good breakfast in the morning and snack in the afternoon served. Flights on time.

### TAP Portugal customer review
BRU-LIS-BRU. All too often they aren't able to offer the basic service which should go without saying. I wasn't able to book online and it wasn't possible to check in online either for some equally dubious reasons. Onboard everything was OK. Both flights on time the A319s are quite comfortable and offer good legroom. Food was rather poor compared to earlier flights.

### TAP Portugal customer review
Booked and paid for flights in Feb 2012 with TAP as advertised as "golf Friendly" with no surcharge for carrying golf clubs. Today I found out by visiting the web site that I will be charged 20 euros each way to carry my clubs when I fly tomorrow. Most airlines add additional charges from a date with those booking pre said date deemed not to be charged increase not TAP they just add charges with out even informing you.

### TAP Portugal customer review
Dusseldorf-Lisbon on an A319 7 October. I was transferred onto this flight from an overbooked Iberia flight via Madrid so can't comment on check-in process. The flight was on time the seat was fine a small but tasty meal served and service was polite and efficient. I have travelled with TAP several times - this was the first time a place docked in Lisbon at an airbridge a great improvement from the normal tedious process with the buses. Baggage arrived promptly.

### TAP Portugal customer review
LHR-LIS on an ancient A320. Flight on time and a meal served. But TAP does not give any reason to recommend it. Plane only about 1/3 full so plenty of space. Check staff at LHR seemed disinterested. Landed a long way from terminal buildings and were bussed. Into the Terminal. If there were an alternative for the route and time I was flying I would choose it.

### TAP Portugal customer review
The flight was delayed 2 hours from original 18.25 with the explanation of poor weather in UK yet the weather was nothing out of the ordinary and most other flights not delayed . The puzzling explanation was compounded when my driver said it was the same 24 hours earlier assuming he was referring to that flight slot. Otherwise no complaints. I wouldn't wish not to recommend the airline in general but for punctuality I am dubious.

Used TAP from Amsterdam to Oporto on board a Fokker 100 operated by Portugalia. Flight left on time. Wonderful hot meal offered and fruit portions small but tasty. Crew were professional and friendly. Check in and boarding was smooth. Bag delivery at Oporto took rather long was not busy our flight was the only one arriving. A good experience and everything on board free including spirits.

### TAP Portugal customer review
LGW-OPO-LGW. The flight both ways was pleasant old planes but a meal is served and price is similar to that of Ryanair and easyjet. Both flights departed and arrived on time and for a European flight TAP Portugal is great but for international travel that's a different story.

Again a very pleasant flight with TAP. Flown Lisbon to Düsseldorf on September 19 on a full Airbus 319 for 45 Euro. Got a full meal with drinks which is great. Staff nice and professional. Flight 15 minutes late as it came in late from Copenhagen. Captain apologized for the delay as the purser did twice. Board magazine "UP" is very interesting to read.

### TAP Portugal customer review
MIA-LIS-MIA A330-200 Executive Class. With the exception of the angled seat which was somewhat uncomfortable in the sleeping position TAP provided better than expected service. Departures only slightly delayed. Arrivals ahead of schedule. Cabin crew provided excellent service and managed to present the vegetarian meal requested at time of reservation. IFE was lacking in variety and quality - too bad no provision for VOD since video just seemed to start and begin without any understandable schedule - music was a better choice. After a second glass of red wine and good slug of Port sleep came quickly!

### TAP Portugal customer review
MUC-LIS: had low expectations about TP and was pleasantly surprised. We travelled with a 2 year old child and the in-flight staff were brilliant looking after us - finding better seats after boarding was completed bringing drinks blankets. Breakfast was delicious and nicely presented but rather small. Airbus had a new IFE with nice map features. Another flight (PDL-LIS) a few days later also very pleasant with nice drinks and snacks offered. We liked TP'S product and will consider them for longer trips as well.

### TAP Portugal customer review
I had a very bad experience with TAP recently flying from London to Lisbon return. The flight to Lisbon was delayed for more than 2 hours no apologies - nothing. That was still ok as we were going on holiday. On our return flight TAP ground staff refused to check our luggage straight to destination stating we had two separate tickets - our connecting flight was on Etihad which is also a partner with TAP on Star Alliance. We were told to retrieve our luggage from T1 at Heathrow and check in again at T4. The check-in staff were not very pleasant when we still asked for our luggage to be sent to final destination and told us to go to customer service and not surprisingly the person there was quite rude too. So we had no choice but to check-in to London and hoping with the 3-hour connecting would be sufficient. Then the flight was delayed 30 minutes and then it was delayed 2 and half hours which would be impossible for us to catch the connecting flight. We had to call Etihad and change our flight - at extra cost plus hotel room.

### TAP Portugal customer review
LHR-LIS-LHR. Outbound on ancient A320 1 hr late with little apology bar 'late inbound aircraft'. Seat and food OK bonus of the 3 seats between the 2 of us. Return truly awful on time admittedly on a newer A320. But honestly the staff were awful. Did nothing to stop the most annoying child running riot on the plane (admittedly her parents did nothing either). Made 6 rows of the aircraft truly miserable. Baggage at LHR took 55 minutes to arrive at the belt even though the screen said Bags Delivered about 15 minutes in. Star Alliance may get their baggage targets this way doesn't mean its right.

### TAP Portugal customer review
TAP punctuality is atrocious. My last flight departed Zurich to Lisbon 50min late. Previous Bucharest to Lisbon was 1hr late. Lisbon to Munich was 2 hrs late with us sitting on the bus to the aircraft for 1 hr resulting with me missing my connecting flight. Budapest to Lisbon was cancelled with a replacement arriving 2 hrs later. So last 4 flights all delayed. Not impressed.

### TAP Portugal customer review
Flew Business Class from Lisbon to Newark. A330-200 went Technical at gate. TAP Ground staff was able to switch to a back-up aircraft within one hour including unloading all cargo luggage catering and refuel the substitute equipment. Substitute Aircraft was also a new A330-200 with Star Alliance colour scheme. Very clean inside crew friendly and professional. Food was fantastic for Airline meal. Only problem was entertainment system which could have had a few more choices of Music and Movies and the seats that turned into a lie-flat bed where not the most comfortable but adequate for a 7.5 hrs flight. All in all it was one of the best transatlantic flight I have taken. Considering the original aircraft going technical before takeoff and getting into Newark with only 60 minutes delay that was excellent.

### TAP Portugal customer review
Flew Business Class GTW-FUN-GTW. Broken seat that wouldn't stay in the upright position and no more space than economy. Outward leg was on time and actually arrived early crew were ok but nothing to write home about and the "food" (cheese and ham sandwich) was edible but not what you would expect. The return was an unmitigated disaster. Flight eventually boarded over 1 hour late and we sat on the Tarmac for a further 2 hours. Crew huddled behind the curtain they eventually offered one small glass of water promptly got a paper (none offered to passengers) then settled down to more laughing and messing about. Throughout the return flight the crew treated the passengers as nothing more than an inconvenience. The language skills of the chief steward were non existent so much so that his female colleagues had to step in and make the English announcements.

Flew Dakar-Lisbon-Frankfurt on Monday. Take-off in Dakar was 3hrs late because they had to first check in customers from the flight that was cancelled the day before. In the end I was lucky to complete 6.30hr flight within 22 hours of the clock - other people spent 48 hours on planes and airports.

Stuttgart-Frankfurt-Lisbon. Flight from Frankfurt to Lisbon was cancelled next flight delayed for a couple of hours due to technical issues - and made an additional stop at Dusseldorf a city in the opposite direction to Lisbon. We arrived delayed for more than 6 hours. Tried to complain at customer relations however I have never heard anything from them. I will avoid flying this airline again.

### TAP Portugal customer review
Flew TP0614 from LIS to BRU in Business on 30 Aug. Never again! You pay Business but TAP puts the overbooked economy passengers into Business with the consequence that you do not have free space between the seats. No possibility to work. Meal consists of sandwich with cheese and ham. There is no reason to fly TAP in business.

### TAP Portugal customer review
Manchester - Lisbon. Airbus A319. 90 minutes late due to late arrival of incoming plane but kept informed and turn around was quick. Sat in row 8 in the seats that convert to business class. Excellent leg room and comfortable leather seats. Drinks trolley with complimentary wine and soft drinks plus a nice sandwich. Overheard screens played a selection of videos and plane tracking. Annoyingly the seat belt signs remained on throughout the flight even though we were flying in calm air - maybe captain forgot to turn them off but some people did get up to visit the toilet. Efficient bus to the terminal direct to immigration so no long walks. Baggage delivered reasonably promptly. A much better experience than the low cost and charter carriers.

### TAP Portugal customer review
Lisbon - Manchester. Fokker F100. This route is shared between TAP and Portugalia dependant on which day you fly. My outward flight was with TAP. The plane whilst old was comfortable with leather seats and good leg room. Overhead bins smaller than the normal so some people had difficulty fitting in their so called hand luggage! 20 mins late departure due to late arrivals. Bussed out to the plane. Quick and efficient cabin service - complimentary wine and soft and hot drinks. A small but tasty hot meal (unusual these days on short European flights) followed by another drinks run. Cabin crew very friendly. Noticeable quiet cabin due to engines at the rear. Overall and excellent airline and better than the mainline TAP Portugal outward journey.

### TAP Portugal customer review
TAP662 Lisbon to Amsterdam Airbus A320. The aircraft was in good condition clean with comfortable seats not much leg room (presume average for the industry). Flight departed on time and arrived on time. Meal was provided during the flight; no choice offered. Quality was pretty average. No personalized in flight entertainment. They had overhead screen with a programme playing but no head set offered to passengers. Cabin crew friendly enough but service levels considered only fair.

### TAP Portugal customer review
Lisbon - Zagreb Aug 26th. It was supposed to be a direct flight but at check-in we found out that it was re- routed via Prague with the expected delay of 2 hours to our destination. The fact is that both direct flights were cancelled and replaced with Lisbon-Prague-Zagreb-Lisbon flight. Departure from Lisbon an hour late. Next we were waiting for almost hour and a half at Prague and even after all the passengers from Prague boarded they explained to us that we are still waiting for the luggage of 4 passengers who came on-board late. Finally we reached the destination 3 hours later than scheduled. The snack was poor and despite the duration of the flight was exactly doubled we didn't get any extra service. Nobody really apologized for the situation like that's a normal thing. However I find such policy very inappropriate. After all there were more than enough passengers flying both to Prague and Zagreb no need to merge flights. And not to mention passengers in transit who missed their subsequent connections or trains busses. Finally we decided never to fly with TAP again.

### TAP Portugal customer review
Flew from Warsaw to Lisbon. My flight was 3 hours delayed no warning explanation or assistance provided. Flight had no food on board no even to purchase. The ticket was very expensive - 890 euros economy class and no food available! Plane looked dirty and smelt. Inflight entertainment was awful. At Lisbon Airport we waited one hour to get luggage from the belt. Horrible experience I will never repeat again with TAP Portugal.

### TAP Portugal customer review
LIS-LHR-LIS in economy. Tickets were cheaper than low-cost alternative. Boarding and deboarding in LIS was by bus which a disadvantage. First flight had a delay of 30 mins and the return flight a delay of 1 hour. On both flight's crew acknowledged explained and apologised for the delay. In-flight entertainment is almost non-existent (which is equivalent to most other European short-haul airline operations). However on the return flight the screens showed the map/distance/time to destination which I think is quite good to have. For both flight's the crew was moderately attentive and caring. The best thing is the catering. No other airline (that I know of) is offering this level of food and drink in European short to medium haul flight's. Where else can you get a big full glass of good red or white wine for free in economy?

### TAP Portugal customer review
OPO-LIS-FRA. My flight was booked with Lufthansa. Check-in at OPO was quick ground personnel was friendly and efficient boarding well organized and departed on time. First flight was very short no meals or beverages offered. Problems began at LIS. The gate was changed twice the flight to FRA departed 40 minutes late. This situation made me feel stressed because I had to make a tight connection in FRA with LH and they had assigned me a seat on the last row which I found to be inadequate. The flight was good seat was quite comfortable there were drop-in LCD monitors and breakfast was provided for free. In summary I found their service to be OK their short/medium haul planes are modern and clean; however I do not recommend LIS airport for connections it is unorganized and ugly. OPO is much better.

### TAP Portugal customer review
LHR-LIS-FAO return. All flights left about 10-30 minutes late yet the time was always made up in flight. Seats are quite comfortable and I would recommend row 24 on A321 as it is exit seat with extra room. Food served is average usually a cold sandwich apart for on LIS-LHR where due to a crew shortage no food or drinks could be served throughout the flight. TAP is a good option against the LCC when going to Europe as they offer competitive rates and include all meals and baggage. It must be said that their Lisbon hub is not the best due to the lack of signs and long walks between gates when transferring.

### TAP Portugal customer review
Very disappointed the food was horrible the seats comfortable but dirty and the entertainment systems were old and damaged on the way to Rio de Janeiro. On the way to Lisbon the service was ok but far away to justified the overpriced tickets. The customer service was disappointing after hearing great things. Expensive tickets but you receive a poor service.

### TAP Portugal customer review
Lisbon-Barcelona. Both flights operated with Fokker the smallest and old plane used in TAP Portugal fleet. Both flights delayed (1h40 on the go 2h50 on the back) boarding by bus (worse than Ryanair) and the plane inside looks very old and was dirty. The food was bad a pretty small card lunch box style with "low-cost" small 1/4 dry sandwich "plastic food". Staff professional but arrogant and the ticket extremely overpriced. (430 euros there and back economy).

### TAP Portugal customer review
18-7-2012 and 12/13-8-2012 from Amsterdam via Lisbon to Newark USA. Both flights Amsterdam-Lisbon v.v. we had old airplanes with little leg space worn leather seats and uninterested personnel. Flight from Lisbon to Newark was with an ancient Airbus after 2.5 hours delay due to technical problems and had no inflight entertainment. The flight from Newark to Lisbon had inflight entertainment and remarkable nice personnel. Leg space and food were reasonable on these long hauls. However the sorry state of Lisbon airport which serves as the hub for TAP made us decide to never ever fly with TAP again.

### TAP Portugal customer review
I have never had so many inconveniences during one flight. During one trip with transit in Lisbon our first flight delayed 2 hours our second flight for 5 and a half hours. On the flight from Madeira to Lisbon (1 hr 30 min duration) there was no meal service on board the crew didn't give passengers even a glass of water it was impossible to get meal vouchers at the airline service desk and finally our baggage did not arrive to our final destination. After 5 and a half hours transit time in Lisbon we are still waiting for them after 3 more days.

### TAP Portugal customer review
I flew Prague to Lisbon and back in one week. Flight to Lisbon was 10 hours late they said there was no aircraft available and on the top of it that the flight was oversold and somebody would have to stay in Prague. They left us waiting several hours without information. Flight originally scheduled at 7.30pm during check-in at 5.30 they said they might have some information at 7pm at 7 they said at 9pm and at 9 they postponed it to 11pm. Only at 1.50am we learned that we would fly at 5am. We got vouchers for refreshments and in the end also a hotel room. When we finally took off none of the crew found it necessary to apologize for the trouble. The flight back to Prague was 3 hours late they did not serve any food and explained that there was not enough crew to serve it. Eventually kids got their meals and adults got a cup of water on request.

### TAP Portugal customer review
I have flown TAP many times from Newark to Porto and I have no complaints. As TAP is the only airline that flies direct from the NYC metro area to Porto I frequent TAP when I go to Portugal. For about $100 more than airlines like Iberia that require me to transfer in Madrid I rather not give myself a hassle and fly direct. Flights are almost always on time. The food is average airplane food and 2 or 3 choices are always offered. Flight attendants are fulfil requests with a smile. The entertainment system on long haul flights is a huge plus. Updated IFE's on some of the planes are even better. Highly recommend!

### TAP Portugal customer review
Lisboa to Bruxelles on 29 July 2012 was more than hour late. Business class meal on this 2.5 hour flight consisted of nuts and a glass of water or orange juice. The inflight entertainment was the same Canadian hidden camera video as on my TAP flight six days earlier and some culinary videos.

### TAP Portugal customer review
Flew from Heathrow to Lisbon on to the Azores. Flight out to the Azores was 3 hours late because they said they had no crew. Coming back to Heathrow the flight was at first 15 minutes late then another 15 minutes late and then another 15 minutes late taking off because we were already late and lost our slot got to over Heathrow and the plane was again 15 to 20 minutes late landing because we were late leaving Lisbon and lost our landing slot. The planes looked dirty and worn but had leg room. The only positive experience of the trip was the cabin crew on all flights seemed nice but the offered "meals" were not very good.

### TAP Portugal customer review
We flew for £193 per person to Portugal from London. It didn't start well as our flight was delayed by 1 hour for an 'unknown reason'. However we soon boarded the plane and it was ok. TAP is a high class budget airline. Don't expect much. If you want a cheap flight I recommend them for their price. If your going on a long haul flight and your going on economy maybe look somewhere else.

### TAP Portugal customer review
AMS-LIS on 16th of July. Evening flight carried out by Portugalia Airlines which was a nice treat! Great leg space very cosy little Fokker 100 and friendly staff. On return flight we had a TAP A320 series. A little more crowded due to the seating but still very good for flights in Europe I suppose. I like the fact that there was a high standard of service as well as meal service. I would definitely fly them again!

### TAP Portugal customer review
LIS-ZAG-LIS. First flight delayed 2 hours with no explanation. When boarding we were informed there would be no catering services as they were flying with minimum cabin crew. Three hours of flight with not even a single glass of water being offered is not acceptable.. The leather of their seats needs urgent refurbishment. Cabin crew very ineffective and uninspired.

### TAP Portugal customer review
I flew with TAP 3 times two internal flights LIS-FUN-LIS and regional flight LIS-MUN. I'm on their loyalty program so try to be very supportive of them. Once in the air I think TAP is fine and I do enjoy their food in Business Class. But getting going is the issue on all 3 flights there was a delay. First 3 hours after changing aircraft 3 times then a 1.5 hr delay and finally an improvement but still 20 minutes late. The fact that I spent 5 hours extra in airports with the same airline makes me question whether they are reliable at all with their time.

### TAP Portugal customer review
(LGW-OPO/LIS-LGW). TAP Discount fares fractionally exceed what Easyjet charge. About right for a full- service but distinctly average airline. Lisbon airport was chaos; queues disorderly and mismanaged. Chunky leather seats (viz. the new slim seats on LH A320s) though comfortable bordered on the claustrophobic. No vegetarian option available at booking or in-flight (and I doubt my companion was the sole vegetarian onboard) but FAs handled our complaints/queries compassionately and professionally. Very friendly and courteous staff from check-in to disembarkation. Loved the safety video - one of those rare moments when you actually crack up during a flight.

### TAP Portugal customer review
June 26th I flew from Fortaleza to Lisbon continuing on to Dusseldorf with a return on July 2nd from Dusseldorf via Lisbon to Recife. Pleasantly surprised with the flights. After some of the negative comments I was not expecting much but TAP has surpassed my expectations from dedicated check in at all airports to separate busses upon arrival and departure in Lisbon to and from the gate. Staff were friendly the food was great and during heavy turbulence the captain kept us very well informed in Portuguese and English on the progress of the flight. All in all I would definitely fly them again.

### TAP Portugal customer review
Outbound flight MUC-LIS delayed six hours. Inbound flight appears as cancelled on Lisbon airport website due to planned four day pilots strike. TAP tell me the flight is still on I travel to the airport six hours early to get rebooked on anything going back to MUC and they still deny it is cancelled. After lining up for one hour get rebooked onto a Lufthansa flight by a TAP agent.

### TAP Portugal customer review
MIA-LIS-MAD-LIS-MIA in late June. Aircraft from MIA to LIS was an A330. All A330 have in-seat individual screens and I understand that about half of their A330 fleet has updated IFE but neither the MIA-LIS nor LIS- MIA flights were aircraft's with the updated IFE. Nonetheless there was still a decent selection of TV shows and movies in English. I usually fly Iberia to Spain so TAP is a huge improvement in the IFE area as Iberia does not have individual screens. I was able to secure exit row seats in all flight legs when I checked in online and at no extra cost. In flight service on the MIA-LIS was lacking a bit. After dinner service they mostly disappear. On the daytime flight returning to the US they were more attentive however they ran out of meals and we were not able to have a choice. Fish was the only "option" and as I don't eat fish I wasn't able to have lunch. Next time I will request a special meal. We weren't even in the back of the plane rather in row 28 and they had run out of meals. The only major scare in general was the ATC strike (which got called off). Otherwise I found the Lisbon airport to be a bit disorganized so I'd give yourself at least two hours when leaving from Lisbon (at least on the transcontinental portion as there were no mazes to navigate when going from Lisbon to Madrid). Also a tip is to print your boarding pass in advance as the check-in line for TAP in Lisbon was incredibly long. As I had checked in online and printed online I was able to go to the baggage drop off station which had maybe one or two people in line ahead of us. In sum I would fly TAP again.

Flight: In last month. LGW-FNC return. Seats good and flights on time. Catering offered very poor and drinks service even worse. No hot food at all. No in flight entertainment.

### TAP Portugal customer review
FCO-LIS-GIG-LIS-FCO. The Fiumicino-Lisbon legs were on A319; Lisbon-Rio and return on an A340. I carefully booked in advance seats on all legs so I could choose seats with a lot of space (27J on the routes from Europe to Brazil and back). 27J has a lot of extra room for legs since it is near the emergency exit and is the first to be served. It is also close to toilets. The A340 is old with practically no IFE and food is very basic. However I found seats to be reasonably comfortable and could sleep in both flights. In the leg from Lisbon to Rio the flight was practically full; in the way back less than 50% of seats was occupied. European legs were also fine: food served is also very basic (including an uneatable sandwich) but at least there was some IFE with flight information. Overall all flights were not that exciting but always on time and transfer within Lisbon airport is pretty fast. Given the price paid (all other airlines were charging much more for the same route) I am satisfied.

### TAP Portugal customer review
We sat on the tarmac at Newark for an hour and a half. Same thing on the way home to the USA. But I don't blame the airline for that. The service was good food was good and processing through to the plane was as efficient as could be expected. I don't have any real complaints. I guess it's that I don't expect to be catered to on airplanes anymore unless I'm in business or first class. My overall experience was positive. It seems like its a good airline and it's well run.

### TAP Portugal customer review
LGW - FNC and return. We usually fly easyjet but they've reduced the number of flights. What a pleasant surprise we got. Flights were fantastic crews were excellent and food and drink are included in the price. The flights were also cheaper than easyjet. The only slight drawback is the early flight time from LGW. Guess which airline we'll be using in future.

### TAP Portugal customer review
Newark to Lisbon delayed 3.5 hrs while the plane sat at terminal. Flight crew casually strolls to the gate 5 minutes before boarding was supposed to start thus delaying that further. Very old plane and staff help on the ground at Lisbon even worse. Terrible experience.

### TAP Portugal customer review
My flight was originally booked with Lufthansa but due to the dispatcher strike I was put on the direct TAP's Lisbon - Prague flight. I could read many complains about TAP here but my experience with the airline is quite the opposite. Despite the pressure the ground staff was friendly that I can't say about many passengers. Yes the flight was delayed but I appreciated not having to spend the night at the airport. Meal vouchers distributed despite the fact the delays were not the airline fault. Snack and beverages served onboard. Clear sky almost for the whole journey so I enjoyed it.

### TAP Portugal customer review
ZRH-LIS Business A321. Airplane with newly painted fuselage but inside still the old style seats with the old tap logo. Legroom seems to be little compared to Swiss. No hot meals but only a cheese and ham platter on china. Good wines. Flights 30min delayed. Priority baggage was last on the belt. But really annoying was another off-duty-crew travelling in last rows in Business sitting 3-3. There was a lot of loud chatter. Crew members off-duty passed by all the time visiting their colleagues in the galley. No calm atmosphere in the cabin. Hence overall not recommendable.

### TAP Portugal customer review
Return flights from Luxembourg to Lisbon and found the airline to be overpriced. Level of service is like Ryanair but double the price. Our return flight home was changed to leave 3 hours earlier. We were informed about this change in an e-mail with the title "Confirmation" so we reasonably assumed it was just re- confirming the flight we had originally booked. Little did we know that this e-mail was exactly the same as our original "Confirmation" in all but one detail yes you've guessed it - the departure time of the return flight. I don't think it is too much to ask to receive an e-mail that says "changed flight" somewhere preferably in the subject line when the schedule is changed. Needless to say we missed our flight and incurred large costs in the effort to get home. The flight we managed to get (which only brought us as far as Brussels) took off 40 minutes late apparently not an uncommon occurrence at TAP.

### TAP Portugal customer review
We have flown to Portugal twice - first time with Ryanair and we said never again not to be treated as cattle. Second time with TAP outward very pleasant and on time cheaper than Ryanair. Return flight cancelled and re-routed via Heathrow with 6hrs lost cancellation said to be due to staff not turning up for work?

### TAP Portugal customer review
Ottawa Canada to Lisbon Portugal via London Heathrow return. Flew TAP on London to Lisbon leg arrived on time but our luggage didn't. (Connection was 1.5 hours). We were travelling onward by train to Porto so we made a baggage claim with Ground Force. They located our bags in London and forwarded them onto us the next day. On the return flight we were met with: Immensely long check-in lines flight from Lisbon to London was delayed 2.5+ hours. Knowing we would miss our connection we saw the Customer Service agent. It took over 1.5 hours to rebook our flight home. They booked us to fly through the USA but did not pull our bags or inform us where our bags had gone. We arrived in Newark at 4pm and they would/could not book us on another Star Alliance partner so we were forced to spend the night in a hotel and travel the following day. When we finally arrived home 24 hours later than planned the Customs officers were less than impressed upon explaining we didn't know where our bags were. Just not worth the headache/stress.

### TAP Portugal customer review
Gatwick to Funchal and back May 2012. Overall impression very good. Online check-in was quick and easy. Flights each way were on time. Aircraft was clean and there was more leg-room than some holiday carriers I've flown with. Flight attendants were polite. Refreshments very basic - really just a make-it-yourself cheese and ham roll and a cup of tea or coffee. No re-fills. Announcements in Portuguese and then English. Would fly again with TAP and most definitely in preference to Easyjet!

### TAP Portugal customer review
LHR-LIS-MIA-LIS-LHR. A320/319 on LHR-LIS legs and A330 LIS-MIA. I paid just over £300 for all flights so I wasn't expecting too much but I was pleasantly surprised. All flights on time and on modern aircraft. Food on all legs was ok and the cabin crew were professional throughout. I would have no hesitation booking with TAP again if the price was right.

### TAP Portugal customer review
I have flown to and from Brazil many times in the last year. Their airbus planes from Northern Brazil to Lisbon is old with seats falling apart and entertainment systems that don't work. Onboard service is horrible after the main meal is served cabin attendants disappear and if you press the service button they never appear. They serve alcoholic beverages with the main meal but you can't get a refill or an extra beer if you wish! Airport in Lisbon is horrible. In Frankfurt Lufthansa manage to board a 747 in 30 min but in Lisbon Tap takes an hour to board an airbus!

### TAP Portugal customer review
I bought a so called business class ticket from Sal Cap Verde to London via Lisbon. It was over 1000 euros one way and a night flight leaving at midnight arriving via Lisbon change of plane at 10.30 am. It was appalling! So called business class seats were ordinary economy seats on both flights. Food was very ordinary. No biz class check-in or priority boarding. Change of plane at Lisbon was awful with buses everywhere business lounge wasn't signposted and had to go through security twice at 05.30 am. No inflight entertainment to speak of just a central few screens and no headphones offered.

LHR to LIS return. Outbound flight cancelled due to ATC strike. TAP call centre was closed so we headed to the airport early and the ticket office informed us we were automatically rebooked to the next flight there was a flight leaving in 45 minutes - they got us on it. Flight fine and included free sandwich and drinks. Return was fine there was a medical emergency which the crew handled well.

### TAP Portugal customer review
I use TAP in Europe on average 2/3 times a month usually very good staff usually much better than Iberia and with kids much better than BA. However just flown them Transatlantic and altogether a different experience - quite simply appalling. Firstly the airport VCP which TAP sell as São Paulo is actually in a different city Campinas. Onboard is a very cramped A340 with very limited entertainment all big screens in centre and no choice. Service dire though call button was faulty but answered 2 hours later. We upgraded on the way back and although better than TAP economy certainly lot of room for improvement given extra price.

### TAP Portugal customer review
LIS-SSA and GIG-LIS. In Lisbon the usual mess at the gate and need to take the bus to get to the plane even on an expensive long-haul flight. The seats are awful very small leg room and entertainment system in the old A330 is very poor. The food is ok but flight attendants just disappear after the meals. Overall experience is average.

### TAP Portugal customer review
Munich-Lisbon-Praia return. A serious improvement from last flights. Flights were on time connections worked well and the earlier departing flights to Africa from Lisbon make the journey shorter and much nicer now. Food was very good not much but fresh and well presented as it should be. Wine was - like always - very good. Nothing to complain about this time.

### TAP Portugal customer review
Return EWR-LIS. Aircraft spotless and comfortable. Entertainment System faulty both ways. Food quite decent. Crew efficient but indifferent to assisting the individual. Twice crew responded to my crew light by turning it off and walking past without a word. Do not expect anything but your meals and little else.

LGW-LIS LIS-LGW return. Checked in online and chose seats with ease. No queue at LGW for bag drop. Flight on A320 3/4 full free onboard service consisted of chicken roll strawberry juice and full drinks service including alcoholic drinks. Crew friendly and efficient; those in business class get served before economy so there is a 30 min wait for drinks after take off. Luggage claimed within 10 mins of landing! Checked in using machine at Lisbon airport which was really easy again no queue for bag drop. Flight on A319 2/3 full crew attentive same meal as outbound flight. Bags came off quickly. Free baggage allowance is very generous.

### TAP Portugal customer review
Two flights in Economy - MAD-LIS on A319 LIS-DUS on A320. Planes were new and clean boarding procedures normal departures on time - just a brief delay in MAD due to heavy traffic. Onboard service ok - TAP is a "full service airline" even on the short flight from MAD to LIS you get a tuna sandwich and a glass of wine plus mineral water. The 3 hour flight from LIS to DUS offered little more a warm sandwich plus salad and pineapple slices - and only one round of drinks. Pleased with the price-quality ratio on these flights and plan to fly TAP again in the future.

LHR-FNC. Onboard upgrade (cost of 250 EUR) for a 3hr 10 mins flight time. Technical problems on the original aircraft. Change of plane and departure 1h35 delayed (airborne at 8h16). Very poor meal service. Cold "breakfast" consisted of only cheese and ham plate and a piece of fruit. Hot bread and croissants and drinks offered twice. I saw the economy class meal and it looked better which makes no sense!

### TAP Portugal customer review
LHW-LIS-FNC. We have done this route twice. Normally we fly direct but last minute flights to Madeira in December are hard to come by. On both occasions we missed our connecting flight to Madeira from Lisbon - no information is given to us on the flight of where we should go at Lisbon airport. When we approach customer services they are 9 times out of 10 very rude and give you the least amount of info required. You have to board the bus to get to another terminal to get to your connecting flight. Onboard cabin crew don't smile and the food is horrible. I have travelled with Easyjet to Madeira and I can honestly say that they do a far better job that TAP.

Newark to Lisbon on an A330. Check-in was quick and pleasant. The attendant confirmed our kosher meal request. Since the flight was not full we asked to change our seat and it was done quickly. As Continental silver elite we were able to board early. Plane was clean the seating was 2x4x2. Legroom and seat width about the same as coach on other airlines. Seats were comfortable and there was even a foot rest. Blankets were needed for the first half of the flight which was very cold. Although we pushed back on-time we were delayed 30-40 mins. There was personal video with touch control. Our kosher food was brought to us early. Overall a good flight.

### TAP Portugal customer review
LIS-VIE return. Online check-in outbound worked flawlessly. Clean and comfortable plane both ways. Professional and nice crew. Friendly on the return flight. The food was the best - on both flights a full hot meal served in economy. I believe TAP is one of the few airlines offering a hot meal on a European 3 hours flight. Overall price of the flight was very good.

Dedicated and separated check-in and ticket desk for business class passengers in LIS extremely polite and helpful agent. Portuguese meal on LIS-ORY flight which was delicious.

MAN-LIS return. Check-in at Manchester good no queue and they gave me my preferred seat. Check-in on return leg longer but still fine. Flight outbound and on return was 50% full. Inflight catering good both ways considering a short haul flight. Free glass of wine outbound. Only minor drawback was they only came around once with the drinks on both flights. Price paid comparable to fares charged on budget airline.

LIS-GRU on A332 business class. In LIS the VIP lounge is well used and only has 3 bathrooms which is insufficient causing queues at times. There is only one shower room which is not enough in comparison to the number of passengers. On boarding we were met by a rude impolite crew. The seat is comfortable but not full flat. The entertainment system is fair and works well. Overall a poor experience.

Horrible so called "First Class" experience. The Inflight magazine has articles about the new chefs and the menu had a special chef's selection dish. But crew said chef menu was not available and we got some horrible pasta dish - so overcooked it was crunchy. The red wine was good but the flight attendant kept snatching my glass off my table when she walked by instead of offering a refill. The second meal looked worse I passed. The flight crew rushed to serve as quickly as possible during the first hour of the flight and then they disappeared into the galley and got angry if you approached them to ask for anything. Entertainment included only 3 movies in English and one had a problem with the English track.

Flew from MAN to LIS on 9th Jan 2012 and returned 14th Jan 2012 with partner and 16 month old. Flight crew on both journeys were friendly and arranged for us to move seats so we had a row of 3 seats to ourselves which made for a more comfortable flight with a toddler. The food was ok nothing fantastic but considering we paid the same price as we would have done flying budget we have no complaints. No inflight entertainment as such but for a 2.5 hr flight this isn't really a problem. Overall very happy with the service received and would certainly fly with the airline again.

Lisbon to Recife but returned after an hour due to oil smell in cabin - while waiting for second plane no information was given no food was offered. Recife to Lisbon had problems on entertaining device (films were stopping by themselves and most games weren't being loaded). Breakfast snack was frozen and flight attendant was rude at my complaint.

LGW-OPO-LGW. On the flight out I was upgraded to business because coach was fully booked. Service was great with attentive staff and a proper meal. Flight left and arrived a bit late but service onboard was generally positive. On the return the plane was almost empty and therefore had 3 seats to myself. Service was ok for a two hour flight and we were given a snack which was fresh and tasty.

My wife and I flew to Madeira via Lisbon Dec 2011. I find there is no leg room on any flights and am disappointed with food provided. I would rather have the option to pay for something I like rather than be forced to accept food I am not interested in. We were confronted with a short connection in Lisbon there is no correct signage for transfer signs are confusing and difficult to understand. Security staff are rude unhelpful and inattentive connection staff provided little explanation of the processes we were simply dumped on a bus. My thoughts are how many other loyal customers TAP are loosing with this level of service TAP needs to up its game and provide a better level of service.

MUC-LIS. Flight full. A320. Travelling with wife and baby. Delay at the gate but arrival delayed only 10 mins. Very tight space in the cabin. FA's finally asked in we wanted a security belt for our baby. In general FA's unprofessional with ups and downs in their behaviour. Flight entertainment not existent. Around 20 minutes before arrival they activated the moving-map system. Warm meal one of the worst tasted on a flight.
