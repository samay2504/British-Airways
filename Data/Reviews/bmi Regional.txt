### "never got a reply"
The flight was ok - Cabin staff nice and helpful, but there are some problems: - my baggage was delayed and I am not happy about the communication round it, I sent e-mails asking about my luggage but never got a reply (this may be handled by a subcontractor but they should make sure the subcontractor does a good job) - some stuff was stolen from my luggage, I complained about this and never got a reply. I read that they have 60 days reply policy - this is just bad, 60 days to reply to customers is a shame - on by flight back (from Bristol to Frankfurt) we had more than 1 hour delay, the boarding started this late already in Bristol (it was very chaotic) - no real reasons were given to us, when we finally boarded the plane it was covered in frost and freezing inside - I have never seen this before - the plane was always prepared and heated up so passengers did not have to wear coats also inside.

### "still waiting for compensation"
Brussels to Bristol. My boyfriend and I arrived at the day of the flight to the airport when they told us, at the security gate, that our flight got cancelled. We had to wait 8 hours at Brussels airport and then, we flew to Birmingham. Our original flight was to Bristol. From Birmingham, we had to pay from our own pockets a train to Bristol that was not cheap at all. Until today, 7 months after, the only thing that we heard from BMI is that they will eventually pay (this was said in August) and to be patient. We are still waiting for cost-coverage and compensation.

### "without any issues"
East Midlands to Brussels. Flight to and from Brussels without any issues. Check in relatively quick and no queues at airport on way there. Onboard, seating was fine with a 1-2 cabin layout. Free refreshments and a small snack. Essentially ok for a short flight. Aircraft themselves are on the older side showing some wear and tear but being able to fly from local airport is a huge bonus. Only downside is being if you need to drop a bag off this only opens 90 minutes before departure, and in Brussels on the return the queue through security was massive (longest I have queued in years). This meant once through was almost straight to the gate for boarding.

### "Pretty much guaranteed delay"
Hamburg to Bristol. Pretty much guaranteed delay again from BMI my route to work in Germany gets hit by BMI delays on outbound and return flights. I have persuaded the crewing office to let me catch a train from Plymouth to London Paddington then Heathrow express to airport to avoid using BMI from Exeter or Bristol I will get there quicker by driving (train) an extra hour and a half - go figure.

### "Goodbye BMI!"
Not Verified | Bristol to Paris. What a totally charmless and unreliable airline this is. I can’t even remember a Bmi regional flight from Bristol that was on time, which clearly makes them unsuitable for business purposes. We’re now 1 hour 25 minutes late and just been served a litany of excuses that fail to engender any sense of confidence in the airline, such as ‘numerous technical problems, some still ongoing’. So it’s anything but BMI henceforth. I could have taken easyJet to Paris which departed on time, 1 hour and 15 minutes ago. And I wouldn’t have needed to check my carry on luggage in the hold. Goodbye BMI!

### "worst airline I ever used"
it is the only connection that safes me from driving to Berlin Tegel to fly to Munich, I wanted to use British Midlands from Rostock to Munich. However the first booking I had was outbound 27.7. from Rostock. The takeoff was 2 Hours delayed, the arrival in Munich too. I lost my reservation at the car hire and had to pay double. At the inbound flight on 30.7. we drove to the airplane by bus, where waiting there 20 Minutes in front of the airplane, until bbeing told there is no crew here yet. The actual departure was 3 Hours delayed. Today the filght was cancelled completely with the notice 2 hours before take off. The worst airline I ever used. It feels as if they are one step away from closing down. Unfortunately I have two bookings pending from November. I think I will cancel them on my costs and accept the drive to Berlin Tegel.

### "they say payment was made"
The flight Paris to Bristol in April was cancelled because the captain didn't like the look of something on the plane. Instead of an early flight we eventually got to Bristol after midnight, not much use for the work planned that day. Their way of fooling you is simple: agree quickly that you deserve the 250 euros compensation, but then do nothing. When you complain they say the payment was made, that it then came back to them, or whatever. It's now September and I realise they never had any intention of making the payment.

### "still have not received a penny"
Flight cancelled on 6th May with no reason given, this was after I had checked my bag in and was sitting at the departure gate. Ground crew at Stanstead (not BMI) was extremely helpful and gave out contact details for compensation and reimbursement. This was applied for on the 8th May 2018. After numerous emails and phone calls and last communication on the 16th August to say my compensation has been process and they were still waiting to process my out of pocked expenses of over £170.00 - this is now the 14th September and I still have not received a penny. I am totally disgusted with their customer services and I will never use their service route again. Why should I be waiting this long on money which is due to me.

### "No info at gate"
Not Verified | Hamburg to Bristol. Always late which they blame on air traffic control. No info at gate stating delay, have to rely on flight stats. Always park miles away from terminal so long bus journey to and from aircraft

### "absolutely dreadful experience"
Not Verified |  I was supposed to fly on the 06:25 flight from Newcastle to Brussels for a connecting flight to Slovenia. The incoming flight on the Sunday had been cancelled but I received no warning. I got to the airport at 5am to find out the flight was delayed by almost 6 hours. The young lad on the desk couldn't offer any help in getting us rerouted. I had meetings planned on the Monday afternoon. There was also no ground staff who could help. I was given a number to ring but the woman I spoke to immediately said I was given the wrong number. She did then try to look at flights but said there wasn't anything she could do. The flight took off over 6 hours late using what seemed like an old plane. A few seats were out of use and the plane had a bad smell. I was over 11 hours late into Ljubliana. An absolutely dreadful experience! It's worth bearing in mind I paid £800 for the flight.

### "a truly awful airline"
Paris to Bristol. Friday 20 July flight from CDG T3 was delayed and eventually cancelled after three hours. I only realised something was happening when l noticed some of the passengers were getting on the airport bus and when I enquired what was happening, the ground crew told us to go to T2A to get the 21:45 BA flight to LHR and then another flight to Bristol. Then we were turfed out in Arrivals to make our own way to T2A. When I eventually found the BA customer services desk in the depths of the terminal the rude woman on customer services denied all knowledge of the arrangement and turned me away. I am now on my way back into Paris and frantically trying to find a way of getting home this weekend. BMI already owe me the statutory Eur 250 from a flight they cancelled without notice several months ago. It’ll be no surprise to learn that they haven’t responded or paid up. BMI are a truly awful airline.Paris to Bristol.

### "no customer service"
Stansted to Derry. They often cancel or delay flights and no customer service. Call centre only open basic office hours and not when you need to speak to someone. 60 daty average response time to emails and no help at the airport. No real people or staff to assist. Worst airline ever booked with.

### "poor customer services"
Bristol to Paris. Upon checking in, found out that my return flight had been cancelled and I had been automatically moved onto another flight (15hrs earlier). This meant I ended up losing a full day of my holiday and was informed the cancellation was due to low passenger numbers on the return flight. No notification prior which was extremely frustrating and then they refused to refund me the return flight costs which would have allowed me to change to another airline with a more appropriate timeslot. Upon my return I contacted BMI customer services to complain, in they end they did agree to pay me compensation but that would be paid in 30 working days. This timeframe came and went with no sight of any payment. I ended having to chase them for the next 4 weeks being told a number of different excuses. It was only when I threaten them with legal action did they pay within 24hrs. This is my fourth flight with BMI and following this experience this will be my last, there unreliable schedule and poor customer services let them down.

### "enjoyed the small plane experience"
Stansted to Derry . Nice old fashioned regional airline! No extra charges for baggage, reserved seats or emergency exits. Comfortable regional jet in 1-2 configuration and plenty of leg room. Once flight attendant managed to serve the whole cabin with a complementary drink and snack an hour, offering second drinks before we landed. Very different to what we have become used to with other, larger airlines! The Embraer jet is small, and no it was not brand new but it departed and arrived on time and all in all, I enjoyed the small plane experience - no crowds, more leg room and a nice free G&T. I would recommend bmi Regional without hesitation.

### "Your Flight is cancelled"
We were due to fly out from Stansted to Derry on 28th May. We woke at 05:00 to find we had received a text cancelling our flight. No explanation or excuse was given, just a one liner "Your Flight is cancelled". When checking the website, the same was seen, no link, to what to do next, no sorry, no refund information, nothing, a big fat zero. And now some 14 days later, having emailed asking for a refund, which I must assume is due, we've heard nothing. We managed to book for the next day with Easyjet, at a cheaper rate for 5 of us. However we are out of pocket, as an addition to getting no refund to date, we've also not been offered any compensation, like the cancellation fee for our car hire, the cost of hiring another car and travelling a greater distance into an alternative airport, to say nothing of the inconvenience of taking time to make another booking for flights, car hire etc. BMI Regional's customer care is appalling, I will not be using them again, and suggest if you are considering it, don't!

### "cancellations routine"
A last minute cancellation of our flight from Munich to Bristol meant our family of 4 (inc. a 2yo and a 6yo) was re-routed via Frankfurt. No explanation was given for the cancellation and we were already at the gate when we were notified. The Lufthansa Service desk staff described such cancellations as "routine" when they re-booked our flight. Our flight MUC-FRA (a Lufthansa service) was fine, but on reaching the gate for our flight FRA-BRS we were told that the next leg (a BMI Service) was cancelled because of technical problems. This was at 19:30. We should have already landed in BRS at 16:50. The kids were exhausted and ready for bed. We were offered either another BMI flight FRA-BRS the next afternoon or a Lufthansa flight to London Heathrow (the other side of the Country; helpful!) that evening. We chose Lufthansa to LHR, figuring that might actually work. Naturally BMI would not cover taxi or other transport back to BRS - that's apparently our problem. We eventually arrived at our final destination at 00:30 with 2 extremely tired children and 2 very grumpy, stressed and exhausted adults. Over 13h travel, door-to-door, for a "short" trip to Bristol! We will be avoiding BMI in future and sticking to Lufthansa, even if it does mean an extra drive across country from LHR.

### "a most efficient service"
Stansted to Derry. This is a most efficient service, with every aspect of it being handled professionally. I love being able to check a (large) bag in, and not having staff say that it is too big, too heavy etc. The air stewardess on my flight was so accommodating to people who had difficulties with managing the steps, and overall had a lovely disposition. The planes are never overcrowded on this Derry route, which makes for a pleasant and comfortable flight.

### "Very poor communications"
❌ Not Verified |  Return flight to Bristol from Gothenberg 20/03/18 pulled, told incrementally 1-2 hours at a time of delays from midday until finally at 22.30 we were herded on to bus from gate to plane & promptly back again. Continual stories told by Menzies staff (no BMI staff at the airport)that planes were arriving from 3 airports. Told that the flight would change destination to Birmingham not Bristol, then reversed. 2300 told no flight, 2330 taken to overnight accommodation, told we would fly 0600 Gothenburg - Frankfurt. Arrived to find a 1 hour delay, flew from Frankfurt to Bristol. Very poor communications, rudeness from Menzies staff, lack of kindness to elderly, young babies, stressed customers missing connections/work/transport at destinations. Arrogant staff whose answer to angry customers was to call security rather than calm very patient but by then annoyed customers. Some meal vouchers eventually supplied were insufficient - 6 euros for 2 of us?! Further vouchers given too late at night & un-usable the next day. Lack of clear comms via customer care line, constantly engaged, phone staff poorly trained & no continuity, no return calls when requested, no records of complaints/claims kept, obscure signposting on website to complaints procedure, still waiting 15/05 for compensation.

### "don't care about customers"
East Midlands to Brussels. Customer services are not flexible at all and aggressive through the phone. Two weeks before the flight day I have contacted them to change a name on the ticket. Impossible because of company policy. This means I will fly with a seat free next to me. Even offering to pay for administrative fee or an additional return ticket. They don't care about customers.

### "Another last minute cancellation"
Brussels to East Midlands. Another last minute cancellation. Unfortunately BMI Regional does not value its customers sufficiently to even contact them and advise them of cancellations. Customer Service has not responded on any previous occasion and correspondence with the CEO is a waste of time and effort. Extremely frustrated by the total lack of customer appreciation or care.

### "Terrible experience"
Terrible experience. We booked and paid in advance for my daughter to have an escorted flight from Hamburg to Bristol as she is only 13. When we arrived at the airport we were informed that this service was not available. We therefore had to remain at the airport until she was ready to board; however, having not expected to be in this situation and therefore not having our passports with us, we were unable to be with her in the boarding lounge. The flight was delayed by over 3 hours, so having arrived at 11:30hrs for a 13:20hrs flight, we ended up having to remain at the airport until 17:00hrs when her flight eventually boarded. During the interim period there was no information on what was happening with the flight or whether indeed it would leave that day until 20 minutes before boarding. When she arrived in Bristol, once again there was no escort available and she was escorted through by a steward from another airline. When I complained about the failure to honour the service booked and requested compensation, this was initially agreed by email, but the flight delay compensation refused. When I pointed out our statutory right this was then reversed and the only compensation for the flight delay paid, after nearly 2 months. They didn't even reimburse the cost of the meal, which we were entitled to due to the delay and refused to enter into any further correspondence once the flight delay compensation was paid.

### "never been on time except once"
Bristol to Aberdeen. I have flown with BMI regional like more than 12 times this year but the flight from Aberdeen to Bristol or back has never been on time except once. The most unreliable airline even when they eventually have a plan ready to flight passengers after delay, the process of getting passengers to plane is pedestrian.

### "BMI did not tell the truth"
Munich to Bristol. Passengers were fed a cock & bull story about an excess weight problem for the flight meaning it would not be possible to land, as the weather conditions in Bristol were too bad (which later evidence showed had no foundation). This information came after being held on the bus at the gate at the airport for 40 mins waiting to be taken to the aircraft. Three volunteers (for a generous fee) were therefore asked to travel on the later plane. The plane was no where near full when it set off. On arrival at Bristol, at least 10 of the passengers' luggage had been left in Munich including mine. We were told the bags would be on the next flight and I was told mine would be with me that evening. When I chased that night, I was told there were no couriers available and it would come the following day. I called BMI customer service to find an explanation for the lack of honesty regarding the delay and problems with this flight and was told to complete an online form. The automated reply to this form said it would take up to 30 days to respond. Nothing after that time so I chased them. A further two weeks without contact and I had to call again. No alternative explanation could be given and no real apology proffered. I am left feeling that BMI did not tell the truth about issues with the flight, passengers were disrespected and the customer service follow up did not live up to what I would expect of this airline. Would not readily choose to fly with them again.

### "poor service at a premium"
Bristol to Brussels. Unfortunately, I have to fly this route very frequently and if any alternatives would be within reach, I'd never choose to fly BMI out of my own free will. Knowing that the KLM flight to Amsterdam is less than half the price of that to Brussels, one would expect to get a half decent service in return, say a plane that leaves on time for example. Unfortunately, company policy at BMI is to offer poor service at a premium, and unfortunately company policy is also to have staff issue insincere apologies for "unfortunate coincidences" that can only be blamed on  very poor management. Yesterday I had the pleasure of sitting through the ordeal again, and the plane was delayed for 2 hours, due to the pilot being "stuck in traffic" coming from London, which was further explained to be a consequence of bad weather the previous day. Nice try but how is that even relevant. Upside of running 2 hours late, one would expect that staff would have had plenty of time to prepare the cabin and solve all possible issues, but alas, unfortunately there was no catering onboard this service tonight, as a sign of their aptitude for crisis management, the airline had managed to scramble leftover sandwiches from other airlines and two bottles of water. Saving the best for last, the cabin attendant unfortunately also had to announce that something was not quite right with the heating system, causing the cabin temperature to be just over freezing point with vents blowing icy air into the cabin. For our comfort the captain generously decided to fly on to Brussels rather than return to Bristol. Of course he did, or they would have had to pay compensation to the passengers. Arriving at Brussels, the same sorry attendant had the final pleasure of announcing that all onwards connections had been missed and that passengers's journeys would be rerouted as soon as possible.

### "am still at 20.52 sitting in Aberdeen airport"
Feeling let down as my bmi Regional flight from Aberdeen to Norwich was due to leave at 3pm today and now find my flight cancelled until 6.25. Having put most people on other aircraft's back, I found myself a single lady flyer having further cancellations and am still at 20.52 sitting in Aberdeen airport with my elderly parents waiting to pick me up at the other end which was meant to be at the latest 5.30pm with an hour travelling time to and from airport 7.5 hours delay for an internal flight! Really bmi.

### "worst airline I have experienced"
Bristol to Hamburg. I am forced to travel with bmi every three weeks. In my opinion they are the worst airline I have experienced. They are significantly overpriced and do not provide any unique services to warrant charging the amounts they do. Air France, KLM and others charge similar amounts but at least offer a reward scheme - rubbish. They have a limited fleet which is why they are often delayed. A flight late into Birmingham will mean a delay from Bristol because they use that one plane to fly multiple routes - rubbish. They claim that a sandwich and drink is included. It is, but invariably they don't have hot drinks, or only a cheap stale tuna sandwich - rubbish. The crew often come across as moody but given the company they work for I can't blame them. Some check in desks only open an hour before the flight - rubbish. Gates often open late and go straight to a "gate closing" status - meaning the uninitiated bmi passenger will rush to the gate just to find it's not yet open - rubbish. I can't think of one redeeming quality.

### "Incredibly frustrating, unreliable"
I booked flights more than 6 months ago to travel from Aberdeen to Norwich around lunch time. A few weeks ago the lunch time flight was cancelled, with no explanation, and an alternative early morning flight was booked. Having reorganized my plans and booked hotel rooms at Aberdeen airport for the early morning flight, we arrived this morning to find the flight cancelled without warning. Now we are due to fly out this afternoon (same day). Incredibly frustrating, unreliable, poor communication and very limited provisions to help us with the delay (the people on the service desk were fine, but not from the airline and with very little ability to do anything other than provide information and food vouchers).

### "they are always delayed"
Bristol to Frankfurt. BMI from Bristol has a bad reputation. The planes and staff are great, but they are always delayed. Looking down the departure board at Bristol on a Monday morning and all of the delayed flights will be BMI. The sad thing is this could be a great service , especially for the business traveller but increasingly you cannot rely on the airline and I have started to use less convenient airports because there is a chance their flights will be on time. Worse still, BMI never answer any queries on their flight delays. So if you have an easy schedule and don't mind being delayed by 3-4 hours then I recommend BMI.

### "delays are always the case"
I flew (or tried to fly) with bmi Regional three times so far. Delays are always the case, twice my flight from Bristol to Dusseldorf was cancelled. The last time I sat on the aircraft with my little one on my lap for 40 mins to then find out that the delay now meant we were too late to land in Dusseldorf and therefore the flight was finally cancelled. My choice was waiting 24 hours, or come back the next morning and fly to an airport three hours away. Absolutely awful. Still trying to get a refund for my parking fees. The application has to be made online and replies take up to 30 working days. At least my flight was refunded in full, even though I feel like I should be getting paid for the hassle it always is. It is my best route from the UK to Germany but for above mentioned reasons I'd rather fly Flybe and drive two more hours.

### "most unreliable airline"
I fly regularly with BMI to places in Germany. But every time there are changes in flight times. I had booked a return flight to Hamburg from Bristol. My flight to Hamburg was booked for Thursday 25th May and ETD was 16.50. When I checked in online the day before, I found out that my ETD had changed to 18.15. I hadn't received any info about this. My return flight to Bristol was originally booked for Monday 29th May at 10.30. A few weeks after my booking, the return flight in the morning was cancelled and the new departure time was 19.55. A week before my flight this time was changed to 21.20, so this was the 3rd change for a flight on the Monday. And then of course there was a delay and the ETD of my flight back to Bristol 23.00 At the end of March I had another return flight booked from Bristol to Dusseldorf. While in Germany, I received a text message that my return flight had changed from the Monday evening to the Tuesday morning so I had to stay another night in Germany with extra costs. I have emailed and phoned BMI, but until today no results. Two years ago a flight from Munich to Bristol was cancelled the night before, however nobody was informed. My return flight to Bristol was scheduled for 06.45 in the morning. After a ride of 2.5 hours I arrived at the airport at 05.00 in the morning, only to find out that the flight was cancelled and nobody knew why. I have tried to get compensation of BMI with no result. That flight times change is not the first time with BMI. Unfortunately, I already booked several flights with BMI for the whole year. I now am going to look for flight with a stop as they are more reliable then flying with BMI. The most unreliable airline in my point of view.

### "flight attendant was very pleasant"
I really like bmi Regional. On an hour long flight from Brno to Munich they offer free drinks and a tasty sandwich. The flight attendant was very pleasant and the seats are very comfortable with generous leg room that you wouldn't expect on such a small aircraft. On time departure and arrival. I would've appreciated more information about the route but other than that it was a great experience and I would travel with bmi Regional anytime. As we were travelling with a child the flight attendant even gave us extra pretzels.

### "lack of a frequent flyer scheme"
I have flown with BMI Regional from Bristol to Dusseldorf and return 5 times in the last 5 weeks and have previously used them on the BRS-FRA and BRS-HAM routes a couple of times each in 2016. I have not experienced any cancellations and the only delay I had was less than an hour (perhaps I was lucky). The prices are high, and do vary quite a lot, so are clearly aimed at business travellers. I suppose they have to in order to make money as none of the flights I've been on in 2016 have been anything like full. The "record" low number was a Friday night DUS-BRS which was run by the larger 47 seat Embraer RJ145 and had 12 people on board. Cabin crew are friendly and helpful, the snacks on board aren't great but they stock a good variety of drinks. My cabin-approved bag (for Easyjet etc) doesn't fit in the overhead bins nor under the seats so goes in the hold and is picked up at the foot of the aircraft steps after the flight. My only major gripe is the lack of a frequent flyer scheme, especially when most on board seem to fly these routes frequently.

### "return flight has been brought forward a whole 24 hours"
In August I booked 2 seats for flights from Bristol to Hamburg leaving on the 23/12/16 and returning to Bristol from Hamburg on the 28/12/16. They were booked well in advance to avoid any problems booking seats closer to the Christmas period. On the 8/12/16 BMI Regional have informed me that the return flight has been brought forward a whole 24 hours to the 27/12/16, thus reducing a 5 day holiday to a 4 day break. As it is just the return flight affected only a refund would be given for that element, they are the only airline flying Hamburg to Bristol so I am effectively stuck with the reduced holiday or come back considerably later than originally booked. Next time when traveling to Hamburg I will not be travelling with the more expensive BMI from my local airport but will drive to Heathrow and use a more reputable airline.

### "the feel of a private jet"
I flew BMI regional from Southampton to Munich on an Embraer RJ145. There was a total of nine passengers on this flight giving the feel of a private jet instead of a small airliner. Complimentary ham roll and coffee served. Crew fine. Left and arrived on time.

### "failure to deliver"
BMI is, in my opinion the worst airline out there. I fly around 25 times per year, mainly between Bristol and Aberdeen. It has become apparent, certainly since the most recent owners, that they really have no grasp of running a passenger airline. The flight yesterday is only the most recent example of failure to deliver (failure happens with unbelievable regularity). It seems to be becoming increasingly acceptable to BMI announce a 2 hour delay's. Note that this is around the same time it would take to drive to Edinburgh (anyone fancy a reasonably reliable departure to Bristol at a third of the price?). I have had enough of it. I collared someone who works for BMI and the response was "I know, its embarrassing, what can we do?

### "customer service is not good"
Regularly use BMI regional to travel between Bristol and Munich for work. Price for flight is usually exceptionally high when compared to other airlines - unless you can get a ticket in one of their sales. Flights often delayed or cancelled with little notice. Flight schedules changed after booking, with up to 3 months delay in airline notifying of the schedule change. Customer service is not good, only able to provide generic half hearted apologies or request you put it in writing - which takes several weeks to get a response and is usually just a generic 'thanks for your feedback' with no real answer to questions. On board magazine and website states that food selection on board is a 'bistro box' however, this is rarely the case, some flights you are lucky to get a small packet of crisps. On the plus side, cabin crew are friendly and helpful, seats are relatively roomy for a small aircraft, and Bristol airport is more convenient than some of the larger airports.

### "avoid at all costs"
Shambles with bmi Regional. Had to change aircraft on way from Bristol to Paris because the pilot announced that the aircraft had been serviced in Portugal. Explaining that it's like getting your car serviced 'it comes back with more problems than it had when it went in'. Waiting for return from Paris to Bristol and 30 mins before departure told that flight is cancelled. IBIS and flight tomorrow is the best they can do. Don't believe they'll manage this either. Avoid at all costs. I will never use them again.

### "chop and change routes"
Not a bad airline but there are certain things that people should be made aware about them. They constantly chop and change routes meaning that you can book a flight thinking that you will be going a certain time but then emailed to tell you later that that flight no longer operates. This happened to me. I had to book a hotel and take a half day off work at the last minute simply because they had changed their route times. Staff are good, planes comfortable if a little long in the tooth. Could do with some upgrading inside. I used to fly with bmi many years ago on exact same planes! They have not changed any at all! Snack and drink included but prices are not the cheapest and on some routes simply expensive. All in, decent airline. Had better though but also had worse.

### "I have finally given up"
I have flown with bmi Regional a number of times for business in Aberdeen from Bristol. 75% of the time the flight is delayed. This means it is impossible to plan business meetings as they are so unreliable and completely defeats the purpose of a regional airline. After sticking with them for so long I have finally given up and will not use them again instead opting for an alternative route. Would not recommend unless timing is not important to you.

### "only two flights were on time"
I am travelling for business reasons fairly regularly with bmi Regional on the route from Hamburg to Bristol and back. With all the flights I have done over the last 4 months I can say that only two flights were on time. Otherwise I had between at least 30 minutes to 2.5 hours delay or even a cancellation. This consistency of delay is honestly speaking not acceptable because it is on such a regular basis that it can only be considered as accepted by the airline because they don't seem to do anything about it to make a change.

### bmi Regional customer review
My wife and I were traveling to Esbjerg from Aberdeen when we were denied boarding by gate agents. Due to an oversight by the ticketing agent, we were required to have visas. By the time this mistake was resolved, the flight departed. A formal complaint was filed with the handling agents, but they denied all responsibility. We contacted customer care at BMI regional and within 24 hours received a reply. They refunded the fare of the missed flight and set forth a formal investigation into the incident at Aberdeen Airport. BMI regional took immediate action and did the right thing!

### bmi Regional customer review
Flew from Aberdeen to Esbjerg 03/02/2015 flight was delayed 45min because of snow and de-icing the aircraft not BMI fault made up some time just offered a drink no food. Flight back 06/02/2015 was on time flight only had 20 people on it snacks in a box and drink were served. All in all good flight bit expensive but my company was paying for it.

### bmi Regional customer review
Bristol to Hamburg. vastly overpriced for what you get. Decided to use an alternative route and carrier.

### bmi Regional customer review
Very easy to use this was my first time flying alone. I found it very easy to find check in desk/boarding gate etc. I flew BHX-GOT and back. Only thing was on the return flight the food was biscuits olive dip etc. so not the usual plus a chocolate bar which I was quite grateful for as after taking a bite of the others I didn't like them but other than that an excellent airline. Baggage was waiting for me as I went into baggage collection area. Was worried that I wouldn't make the flight as I turned up at the airport quite late however check in was fast and in the end had to wait for a while for gate to open so was great! Thank you BMI Regional am flying with you again in December/January.

### bmi Regional customer review
I have made several BMI flights from Bristol in the past three months including some Brussels Airlines flights which are operated by BMI. All were most satisfactory: on time welcoming staff comfortable Embraer aircraft and generally good treatment. My only slight gripe is that check-in for most flights cannot be done online but as there has never been a queue at the desk it is not a problem. I look forward to my next journey with BMI.

### bmi Regional customer review
Travelled with my husband in November and flight was changed by BMI from morning to evening travelled again in March and April so you could say frequent flyers with BMI. We had to accept the change in November or offered refund. When I asked if my son could change his flight from morning to evening this Friday 25th April we were told we'd have to pay another 314 euros extra. Surely if it works one way it should work the other way.

BMI Regional is a very nice carrier. Flights on time. drinks and bags included. much nicer in the route Aberdeen - Manchester than Flybe.

Manchester-Aberdeen day return. Very impressed with the service on the ERJ135 to Aberdeen. Great service. Food going we had a cup of tea and Blueberry Muffin which was excellent. Check-in in both airports very quick. Return flight we we're on an ERJ145 we'd taken off a bit early However while 10 minutes away from Manchester the pilot returned the aircraft to Aberdeen because the aircraft developed a technical fault something to do with de-icing system. We landed at Aberdeen and waiting one hour in the terminal while BMI was finding other arrangements to return the flight to Manchester which I found very quick. BMI found a return aircraft. I would fly with them again. Flying with them again soon.

BRU-EDI-BRU in economy. On-time flights on comfortable aircraft including free refreshments and bar service. Luggage waiting on the belt when arriving in luggage hall in EDI and BRU and that is a very rare experience in BRU! A pity this route will be discontinued from January.

Flight from Bristol to Malpensa boarded at 11.15 in the air by 11.30 brilliant. We were offered sandwiches and a drink all complimentary. Staff were very friendly and it was nice to be able to have a chat with them. Our luggage was waiting for us when we arrived at the luggage pick up. Out of the airport within 30 mins. Only concern the plane was only just over half full hope they do not pull this flight.

Flew LBA to BRU at the beginning of May. Both flights on time planes clean efficient service. Would definitely use again. Unfortunately our return flight was BMI regional's last flight into LBA so this route on longer exists.

Travelled between Bristol and Frankfurt with a family of 6. Ages ranged between 6 and 60. Service was faultless. Great service on outward and return flights. Fed and watered both ways at no extra charge. But the best bit was finding my suitcase was waiting for me in the baggage hall on my return to Bristol. The quickest passage through an airport ever.

LBA-BRU used several times recently. Convenient and excellent service but now I find it has been pulled with effect from a few weeks' time. Nothing about this on website - had to go through the dreaded call-centre process to find out why the online booking page offered no flights on my selected dates in June. Maybe sound commercial reasons but very poor show in not being upfront about this.

EDI to MAN short flight with quarter-full Embraer 145. One flight attendant. Drinks and snack round for free including hot drinks and alcohol. Luggage very promptly arrived on reaching Manchester. Flight on time. No hesitation to use again. In-flight entertainment for this 40 minute flight not provided but unnecessary. Magazine in seat pocket.

Bristol - Aberdeen (day return!). Both outward and return flights departed on time. Flight attendant on both flights very pleasant and despite not being able to check in on-line no queues at check-in desks either at Bristol or Aberdeen. Seating arrangement was 1-2 and very little space in overhead lockers but oversized cabin baggage was put in the hold and returned as you left the aircraft. Served a complimentary cheese and tomato chutney croissant on outward flight and choice of packet of savoury snacks or shortbread finger on return together with a drink. Only strange thing - on both flights the estimated flight time was not given by the captains!

EDI-ZRH. Impressed and would recommend: Check-in was quick and efficient by Servisair at EDI. Aircraft was an Embraer 145 and has a 1-2 seating arrangement. The fight was lightly-loaded at around 20 Pax out of a possible 49. Boarding was so so Servisair - EDI appear to have a bad habit of gathering passengers and have them wait outside (in the cold!) until the flight crew are ready to receive them. (I have encountered this situation before at EDI on other carriers' flights). The flight departed early and a light snack was serviced on board by the cheerful cabin crew member. The Captain provided plenty of in-flight information and arrival at ZRH was around 20 minutes early. I would travel with bmir again. I have travelled with them before when they were a Star Alliance member. This is the only negative for me - the present lack of an airline alliance under the new owners/management. I hope they are working on this issue.

Really impressed with the service. Planes are really small but it's a full service and the attendants are lovely. Edinburgh to Copenhagen and back. Flights were on time and smooth. No inflight entertainment. No issue though as its less than 2 hours. Website does says online check in which isn't true so it is old fashioned counter check in. They are sorting that though.

EDI-MAN return. Very impressed: aircraft was an Embraer 135 in both directions with a 1-2 seating arrangement - almost like a private jet. Both flights were lightly-loaded so check-in was quick at both Edinburgh and Manchester: boarding was fast (although airbridges could not be used because of the size of the aircraft) and one flight departed slightly early with the other flight on time. In the air sufficient space for hand baggage in the overhead bin cheerful efficient cabin crew member (only one because of the size of the aircraft) free hot drinks and biscuits smooth flights both ways with plenty of information from the flight deck regarding routing and weather and estimated time of arrival. On arrival bags delivered fast at both ends. As a business airline they have made a good start: bmi regional have an all-jet fleet (unlike the competitor on this route) are cheaper than the competitor and provide complimentary catering: I will certainly travel them again.
