### "never use this airline again"
Istanbul to Tehran. They lost our suitcase with all our belongings. For follow up they refered us to another interim section. Their excuse was: "It happens everywhere even with famous airlines". It was really waste of time and money and a bad experience for us. I will never use this airline again.

### "one of the better airlines"
Tehran to Tabriz, and ATA Airlines used an MD-82. The aircraft have seen its better days long time ago. Flight from Tehran to Tabriz was re scheduled one hour later as originally but I got information upfront. Finally there have been another 45 minutes delay as there seemed to be a technical problem. During waiting it becomes very warm as the aircon was not working till departure. The return flight was in time. Seating is very tight especially when aircraft was almost full which was the case on both flights. Crew was friendly but English skills are limited. On both one hour flights they serve a lunch box, banana, juice, chocolate bars. However, when flying in Iran, ATA Airlines is one of the better airlines, there are no better alternatives on this route. Either you use them or take the bus or the train.
