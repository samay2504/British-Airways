### "this company is a total chaos"
Not Verified |  This is an incredibly unreliable company. I was travelling with my dog who was supposed to travel in the luggage compartment. We called AJet before the flight to book the place for the dog. We talked with the staff at the check-in counter at the airport and everything seemed fine. I paid for the pet transportation at the airport. It was when the boarding had started that they let me know that the crew refused to take my dog on board. Reason? The temperature of luggage compartment of the airplane can not be controlled by the crew. They couldn't tell me how it's possible that the luggage compartment is not suitable for pet transportation however it's possible to book a place there. And to pay for it! What's more, a second dog of ours had happily travelled by the same airline in the same plane just three weeks before! After some time of arguing the ground staff showed me a message from the crew that they refused to take the dog "under any circumstance". I had to fly so I left my dog in Almaty with my friends which was a tough decision. After I boarded the plane I found out that there was no place left for my cabin luggage as well as for the luggage of some other passengers. That's why some of the suitcases were taken from the cabin to the luggage compartment. It gave me a thought that maybe the real reason for not taking my pet onboard was the over-booking and excessive amount of luggage. We had to travel back to Kazakhstan to take my dog with another flight, the expenses we were totally not ready for. What's more, we haven't even received the refund from AJet. Problems that seem small compared to this but that should be mentioned: the airplane was packed, the air conditioning was poor making it really hard to breath which is quite a torture for the 5 hours flight. The food and drinks were available only for cash or credit cards and as I had a debit card I couldn't afford anything. But thankfully they gave me a free glass of water. Do not recommend, this company is a total chaos.

### "put me and my wife in two separate seats"
My wife and I flew from Istanbul to Antalya on October 10, 2024 at 7:10 p.m. Turkey time. Unfortunately, the departure gate number 208B was incorrectly printed on our flight card - the original and the image of the card are available. At 6:50 p.m., my wife and I realized that gate number 208B belonged to a flight to another city The second mistake of this company is that there was no departure gate listed on the online website indicating the flights for our flight - No. VF3032, and the airport flight information board was written as Gate No. 409. God knows that if the help of a kind person at the airport We couldn't make it to the flight, we sped through several floors of the airport until all but the last four passengers were on a separate bus with delays. Let's get to the flight, when we boarded, the angry and bad-tempered flight attendant put me and my wife in two separate seats, while we had two chairs next to each other - according to the flight card - one flight.

### "Would not recommend it"
Would not recommend it to anyone. They lost our suitcase and for one month there were no updates. After one month they called to notify us that they found the suitcase. They pretended like that nothing is wrong, unbelievable. Worst experience ever.

### “irresponsible airline”
Never fly with this irresponsible airline. I am a travel agent and unfortunately I had to book many tickets with this new unprofessional Airline. 90% of their flights get canceled or delayed, and no one is responsible either in the call centre or any office (they don't have offices in most of countries).

### “worst catering I have had in 27 years”
I was looking on Turkish Airlines' website for a return flight from Istanbul to Diyarbakir. The outward flight at the time I wanted was on Ajet. Although shown in the Turkish Airlines' computer, it made me go to Ajet site to book. So I did that and then came back to Turkish Airlines to book my return ticket. Entering the aircraft was like stepping back in time. Old fashioned ceiling and wall panels, small luggage bins, no video screens. After take-off there was a line of people waiting for the toilet until the crew realized it had been locked during departure, but had not been unlocked after take-off. A Turkish Airlines cart was brought through the cabin from which cold snacks and soft drinks were available for sale. I bought a sandwich and drink. One bite of the sandwich told it was cold, dry and stodgy. I looked inside and as you can see in the photo there was a miniscule amount of butter (maybe not even butter) on both sides of the bread. It was undoubtedly the worst catering I have had from Turkish Airlines in 27 years flying on them. Later I saw what were obviously hot crew meal entrees being taken to the rear galley. I hope they at least had something good to eat! Adding the cost of my sandwich and drink, I paid more on Ajet than for my flight back on Turkish Airlines. The crew were polite, with a few smiles. One of the crew 'uniforms' was navy blue and green, another all red and a third all grey. I only saw three of the crew. The recorded announcements were clear and understandable, but live ones were at double speed and mostly unintelligible. Credit where credit is due, the flight departed on time and arrived slightly early. I had worried about this when I saw that the preceding Tehran flight on the same aircraft was over nine hours delayed. Will I fly Ajet again? Probably not unless there is no other option.

### "I lost my money"
My ADB/SAW flight which was made on AJet July 18, was changed much earlier than notified to me (at the new time is 10:25 in the morning (16:10).) When I arrived at the airport because the agency approved it without notifying me, I naturally applied to the AJet sales office because my flight has already left. I cannot use my SAW/DXB flight because the sales office did not notify me of the change made by the agency. I can't make free changes and the first SAW/DXB flight is on 05.08.2024. I lost my money and my work

### "My experience was very smooth"
Not Verified |   My experience was very smooth, no flight changes or surprises in the departure flight. In the arrival flight there was a security threat in Beirut Airport resulting in flight delays for ALL airlines. The way Ajet dealt with the situation was outstanding and professional. Given the unintended delays, we missed the next flight. Without even asking and as soon as we arrived to their desk, they fixed the flight for the next day and offered us free transport, hotel, and meals. The air and ground crew is very nice and helpful. The only setback is in communicating with the Airport employees in English. Until this improves, communicate with a smile and nice attitude, and you'll get what you want eventually.
