### "attentive and polite cabin crew"
IG 801, Milan Malpensa to Cairo. 21/02/2018. Comfortable aircraft, outstandingly attentive and polite cabin crew, considerate to all passengers. Competitive price, delivered safely to Cairo. All good. Based on this first experience with Meridiana, I have booked two more flights with with them. No complaints whatsoever and no hesitation in offering a recommendation.

### "flight was still delayed"
Dakar to Milan. Before heading the airport I checked the stats for this flight and it commonly had a delay of at least 40 mins. I got the airport expecting this delay but was surprised when the aircraft trundled to the gate early. Perhaps today would be my lucky day. It wasnâ€™t. Despite being early, the flight was still delayed and I am waiting in the departure lounge of this  airport. It is due to leave in 4 mins. The cause of the delay is operational reasons. Meridiana should be avoided if a better option exists.

### "flight was delayed by 15 hours"
Naples to New York JFK. Customer service does not exist. My flight was delayed by 15 hours. Meridiana did not have a representative on sight at the airport to give information. This was left to the airport staff. There was only one announcement made during the entire time. That was only to say they would give us information when they had it. All other information was passed around the room by word of mouth or by overhearing information. Meal vouchers were given for one bar in the airport. This is fine if the delay is only a couple of hours, however multiple meal vouchers were needed to a place which only offered very limited options. When we finally made it home I called Meridiana's New York office to ask what I needed to do and was interrupted and spoken very rudely to. She said send an email. I did this but also heard (from another passenger) of a claim form that needs to be filled out. Why is this information not given by personnel? On the flight bring your own water. The call button doesn't work or they ignore it. When I got up and asked a flight attendant for water I was told to push the call button. That was unsuccessful. Finally I was given a tiny cup of water. This was not just me, by the way. Multiple passengers around me were having a similar issue. Download your own movies. This is not a huge issue but having flown overseas many times in the past I was used to being provided at least one movie. You only get entertainment if you fly Business Class on Meridiana.

### "Avoid this airline at all costs"
Showed up at the airport for a 8.50am flight from Naples to New York JFK only to see that it had been delayed 12 hours. They say this is due to the previous flight out of Naples having mechanical issues and leaving late. You would assume any responsible company would plan ahead at least 24 hours and route another plane or find connections for their customers. They didn't help at all or give notice when they knew the flight would be delayed. They offer no compensation for missed connections or inconvenience. They did give us a horrible meal voucher good for next to nothing. Avoid this airline at all costs.

### "Never consider flying Meridiana"
Naples to New York JFK. They have one plane that flies to JFK and back. So it was broken and they kept us at the airport for 10+ hours not "recommending" to leave because they didn't know when the airplane would be repaired. They gave us meal vouchers to the worst fast food place at the airport, so i just couldn't eat it and had to spend my own money to get reasonable food. The airline representatives were disreapectful to tired people and didn't provide any reasonable waiting space. People slept in a cold tile floor! They made 1 announcement on what was going on during the whole day and it was done without any microphone and the woman who made it was speaking with a really soft voice so nobody knew what she said. Never consider flying Meridiana.

### "I was pleasantly surprised"
Naples to New York JFK. I flew this airline with caution after the reviews but I was pleasantly surprised. One way with Meridiana for $340 was the cheapest flight offered by any airline. We got a free checked bag which was nice especially after my experiences with other cheap airlines. The flight itself was also nice. We flew economy and I felt like I had sufficient room and comfortable seats that retracted. It was a ten hour flight and they fed us twice, both appetizing meals. I would definitely recommend this flight especially for the price.

### "staff were pleasant and efficient"
Roma to Olbia. I hesitated about flying to Olbia, the ferry being another option, given the poor reviews for Meridiana (the only company that operates a direct flight from Rome to Olbia). In the end I decided to take the plunge on the basis that perhaps people with good experiences rarely bother to give feedback. And I am glad I did. The on-line booking was straightforward, as was the web-checkin, bag-drop etc. Ground staff and cabin staff were pleasant and efficient, the plane boarded and left on time and we arrived on-time, maybe even a few minutes earlier.

### "not an airline I can recommend"
I have flown with Meridiana (operated by Air Italy) from Milan to Mauritius and back. Before the flight I tried several times to contact their Call Center to make a seat reservation - their own Call Center told me several times that the flight is made by Air Italy and that they cannot reserve a seat in such case - this is a lie! They are the same company (Air Italy is a subsidiary of Meridiana) and after several months of calling there I was able to make a seat reservation. Second impression I had was at my seat in the plane. I couldnt believe that the right armrest of the seat is broken and taped up. Service during the flight was : at beginning and before landing 0,15 dcl of water (juice etc) - for a 11 hours flight a great deal! They served also something what they call dinner. I tried it, taste was terrible. Service has been all the time very reserved without a indication of a smile or interest of passenger. Other thing is how they are dealing with the seat reservations shortly before the flight and onboard. They have tried to change my paid seat to another (but they didnt have any aisle seat available so I disagreed). Later on board I could see a big chaos because more than 20 people have had the same seats assigned - this was probably caused by the fact that 80% have got the seat on Madagaskar and the rest on Mauritius (plane was going through Madagaskar to Mauritius and in 2 hours back). Also thanks to this chaos we arrived back in Milan with more than 1 hour delay. Overall not an airline I can recommend.

### "service onboard was good"
New York JFK to Naples with Meridiana. I was very apprehensive about flying Meridiana after reading some reviews, but I'm glad to say everything from the use of the Air France lounge at JFK to the courtesy and service onboard was as good as any airline I have ever flown. And it was equally true on our return flight from Naples to JFK. The only area that found on my 2 flights that need help is in the condition of the cabin and seats. The business class seats are well worn and ready for replacement as well as the carpets etc. Our flights were generally on time and the ground people were organized and efficient. The gods of aviation smiled on us.

### "do not book with Meridiana"
New York to Palermo, Italy. From the moment we confirmed this flight by paying last April, had the sinking feeling it was a mistake. It is almost impossible to reach airline representatives by phone and if you do it may be returned voice mail 24 hours after you call. Seat assignment process was difficult and reviews of performance not good. Yesterday the hammer dropped. Interminable wait to board our flight in New York JFK, then an announcement it had been cancelled. A sort of Keystone Cop melee to get passengers into nearby hotel. Must say this place is good. We are waiting this next morning to see if they fly us out today. Meanwhile we missed a prearranged day tour of Palermo scheduled for tomorrow AM. So, unless you really have to save money and don't mind uncertainty and a sort of 'make it up as we go' philosophy and a tiny airline that has no planes on back up, fly Meridiana. Otherwise, do not book with Meridiana!

### "Meridiana does not care"
We flew with Meridiana from Gatwick to Olbia, both our checked luggages have got lost. Its more than 48 hours and we still have not got any update despite calling all possible numbers from Olbia airport to Meridiana Customer Care to Gatwick airport. In fact nobody is looking for our luggage. Meridiana told us it is responsibility of the airport in Olbia for the first 5 days. But the airport is just passively waiting if someone sends it to Olbia - nothing else. Meridiana does not care. Our vacation ends in 4 day. We are left hopeless, Meridiana customer service is very bad. They are just pushing responsibilty on others and not doing anything, not even calling Gatwick to ask them about our luggages. It seems the bar code on the luggages is useless since it it not in any sytem visible so that they cannot track the luggage. We were not the only people with the lost luggage on the flight.

### "you get what you pay for"
Naples to New York with Meridiana. Worst airline I have ever flown with. There is a saying "you get what you pay for". The reviews were horrendous before I booked it but they were significantly cheaper - so we booked it anyway. Our flight out from JFK was 5 hrs late which meant we spent 9 hours sitting around at airport. Lost a whole day in Naples. Again on way back to NY they were late running over an hour delay with buses to take you 20 feet and waiting in the pouring rain to drop hundreds of passengers off. They boarded pasengers from both ends without screening seats so on board people were trapped staring at each other and couldnt pass. I'm sorry but the level of incompetence at simple boarding procedures ensures that I will never fly again with this airline. There is a difference between economy and incompetence.

### "no idea what was going on"
Our flight from New York JFK to Naples was delayed a total of 7 hours for no reason. Flight status was not available on Google and other tracking sites. Luckily my boyfriend called Meridiana before we left for the airport, so we knew we would be delayed, but we did not feel confident in the new times. The flight kept getting pushed back by an hour or so. In a series of calls on our way to the airport, we were informed the flight was delayed until 7:30pm, then 8pm, then finally 7pm - 4 hours after our original departure time. No severe weather, no technical issues, no explanation. When we arrived at our assigned gate, no Meridiana representative was available to answer any questions, and the gate did not display the correct flight information. The crowd grew more and more frustrated as we were delayed another hour and a half at the gate. Airline employees had no idea what was going on. One helpfully said, "All I know is that there's a plane leaving tonight. The nightmare didn't end once we boarded. The seats were impossibly narrow and lacked individual TV screens. One of the seats in our row was duct taped together. We were delayed on the Tarmac for another hour and a half in a cramped, poorly ventilated plane from 1986 because of traffic. The food was the least of our problems. We dreaded our flight back at the end of our vacation. We only departed from Naples 30 minutes late, but halfway through the flight, the seat in front of my boyfriend's broke - reclined all the way back at a bizarre angle. The seat aisle-side arm was also off - a crew member popped it back into place, apologized and and informed us that they were waiting for new seats because the old ones break often. They operate this flight to get people looking to fly directly to Naples on a low budget. Pay the extra $ for a flight where you receive clear communication from the airline and the plane isn't falling apart. The money (and time, if it requires a stopover) will be worth the peace of mind.

### "flight attendant service good"
Only non-stop to Naples from United States. Great price. Got boarding ticket and seat assignment online a few days before the flight. Check in service fast and uneventful. Gate easy to find. Boarded on time and departed 15 minutes after scheduled departure time. Flight was fine. Food okay for airline. Flight attendant service good. I don't need much attention. Arrived in Naples 1 hour early. Would fly Meridiana again.

### "recommend using this airline"
This is a basic, no frills airline. We flew from Naples to NYC, in early Sept. 2016, economy. The flight was delayed by about 2 hours, partly due to weather the previous day and partly due to a very poor boarding procedure at the Naples airport (likely not Meridiana's fault). The plane was pretty old, with no charging stations or any entertainment system. The service was very good, the staff spoke English and were professional and mostly nice. The food was average. The seats were of average comfort, legroom and cleanliness. Blankets and pillows were provided free of charge. The flight was uneventful. It cost around $300 one way and I think that's a very good bang for the buck. If you don't care about bells and whistles, like entertainment system, I'd recommend using this airline to fly into and/or out of Italy.

### "wonderful customer care"
London Gatwick to Naples. I have used Meridiana for this flight route a few times, have never encountered problems and found the flight attendants very accomodating and in particular one ground attendant. I travelled with identity card and passport, when I boarded the plane I realised I had lost my passport in one of the shops in the waiting area quite a distance away from the gate but it was too late for me to go back to where I thought I had lost the passport and so asked the attendant what I should do, of course the only option was the lost property office but I would have to wait 24 hours for it to be handed in and as I was leaving the country it would be complicated. I was very upset with myself. I boarded the plane and before the door was closed for the flight to get ready for take off, there the attendant appeared with my passport in hand. I cannot tell you how grateful I am to her caring enough. I don't know how she managed to find it, but I would like to say thank you to Meridiana and their staff. Wonderful customer care.

### "they do what they say"
Flew from New York JFK to Palermo. I read some of the complaints posted, and this is a budget airline that offers decent service at the lowest prices. If you want a business class service, book a flight on a larger commercial airline. We have travelled with Meridiana a few times in the past few years, last time June 2016, there were 8 of us, and they do what they say, got us safely from JFK to Palermo, non-stop. All of our flights there and back have left on time and have arrived early. It's a no frills airline, you are not paying for frills, you are paying a very discounted price. If you don't like the food, and really who does, plan ahead, bring the food you like on board with you. I bring my own entertainment system on board, i.e., my laptop with movies on CDs, my iPad with books and games downloaded. I am thankful this low cost airline is available so we can stretch the travel budget to take 2 or 3 trips a year to Italy. We will continue flying Meridiana.

### "flight attendants were very accommodating"
Flew Meridiana from London to Olbia. Flight departed on time, arrived a bit earlier than scheduled, the flight was uneventful, got a snack and a smile. The trip back was even better, MD-82 - spacious, quiet airplane, I wish they did them like this now. Pilots made good announcements, flight attendants were very accommodating. Aircraft was old but very clean.

### "never use this airline again"
JFK New York to Naples, Italy return, operated by Air Italy. Let's start with our departure from JFK. No online check in available. I sent an email, no response. I called in, and a woman said I had to check in at the airport. At JFK, Meridiana had one little line and no signs to help travelers. We paid for the extra comfort seating and the guy told us we didn't have to pay for the extra bag we brought. That was nice, as we hadn't anticipated that. He told us it was because we paid for the extra comfort seat. Now here's the sketchy part, we go to find our gate. Yellow paper signs were hung up with our flight info on it, but other than that nothing. We didn't actually HAVE a gate. None of the attendants in the airport knew anything about where we're supposed to go. OUR flight was scheduled to depart at 7pm, and we were supposed to board at 6:45. We didn't board until 9:45. No one told us anything. We weren't given any reason, despite the fact that the plane was sitting outside in our view. The plane was a was a rickety old thing from the 90s. No televisions (they had the large general ones and they were cloudy so you couldn't see them), seats were small. Staff was reasonably accommodating, but they rarely brought something to drink, they were catering mostly to those in business. We had one disgusting meal. That flight left 3.5 hours late and landed in Naples. For our return, I wanted to try to upgrade to business. I sent an email asking - no response. I sent an email in Italian (luckily I'm fluent), and interestingly enough I got a response. No availability. So coming back, we had so much fun! Turns out we did have to pay for that extra bag, 90 euros, despite the extra comfort seats, and they wouldn't let us take our carry on bags, we had to check those as well. This wasn't even because they were overweight - the woman in Naples insisted they be checked. Once again, sketchy Meridiana had paper signs hanging up for their "special" line for security in the Naples airport. The gate changed three times. We had B10 written on our tickets, I walked a few feet looked up and it changed to B12, got to B12 and there was another passport control. I told the woman it kept changing and she said "no it didn't," and I told her the flight and she said, "oh yes it did. I understand that that's not the airline's fault, but one thing after another. Coming back to JFK, we left about a half hour late, which is not bad. Again, the flight was very uncomfortable. Staff wasn't that great. Bottom line - you get what you pay for. If you want to fly direct from JFK to Naples, it may be worth it. I will personally never use this airline again.

### "flight was uneventful"
We flew from London Gatwick to Olbia Sardinia with Meridiana. The booking was a nightmare, the online computer kept crashing and requesting me to try again. After numerous failed attempts I rang the call centre for help, all they could do was to instruct me to try booking two single tickets, surprise surprise this too failed, a whole day wasted and nothing to show for it. The following day an instinct made me ring my credit card and was horrified to find that two payments had been taken from my account by Meridiana yet no tickets provided. To cut a long story short a total of 7 emails largely unanswered and 4 phone calls totaling 67 minutes at a cost of Â£37 I eventually got my tickets but no refund. Fortunately the credit card company were on the ball and credited the money owing. This call centre is beyond useless I am dreaming that they may actually refund my phone bill. Having received my eticket the online check in was okay albeit in Italian but there was no indication that the operation was sucessful. Boarding passes arrived the next day by email but were torn up on arrival at Gatwick, how odd, standard tickets issued. The check in was amazing for Gatwick, so quiet, no queues and unhurried, we seemed almost to be the only passengers. The staff were friendly and we had plenty of time to stroll to the gate once announced, boarding was delayed resulting in a 30 minute late take off. The aircraft a Boeing 737-300 was around 20 years old but it was fine, a capacity of around 120 is much lower than the regular 737's, with less than 100 passengers the whole process through the airport was unhurried. The flight was uneventful but we were given a roll and drink, most unexpected these days. My seat itself was comfortable but at 6' 3" I did find my knees digging into the seat in front, not so good. There were two empty rows of emergency seats behind me but perversly was not allowed to sit there without paying extra. A thought crossed my mind, I have flown in these seats many times with other airlines and I have always been instructed to familiarise myself with the proceedure of opening the emergency exit in case of an emergency. Maybe Meridiana are operating within airline regulations but with no one sitting next to the exit with knowledge, how long would it take for somebody to reach the exit, read and understand the instructions then execute during panic and possible darkness? A disaster waiting to happen. The departure from Olbia was equally quiet and laid back and the flight to Gatwick uneventful.

### "might be cheaper but it's not worth it"
We had a 1.20 flight booked from Venice to Olbia with Meridiana. Flight was delayed for 2hrs then at 3pm cancelled. At no stage was any explaination provided for the cancellation. There was 1 staff member for the whole flight trying to sort out who got on another flight from Bologna (65 places) and we didn't mange to push our way to front of queue to get on. We had to pay for a whole new flight with Volotea as there was no way out of Venice otherwise. Getting our luggage back was an absolute nightmare and took 2 hrs. We finally landed in Sardinia 8 hours after our expected arrival and 900Euro poorer. Absolutely disgraceful and will never use them again. and have no idea of how to get our money back from cancelled flight. Don't fly with Meridiana. It might be cheaper but it's not worth it

### "no help was offered whatsoever"
We were delayed 8 hours. During our wait we had no information whatsoever (even the Airline Information desk were devoid of info from the Airline). After 8 hours waiting we were suddenly told to go to the Gate and that it would be closing in 6 minutes. Panic ensued. The Gate was at least a 10 minute walk (run!) away. We are in our late 60's and not as nimble as some - no help was offered whatsoever. Then after this awful panic we were kept waiting for nearly half an hour at the gate. All crammed in and as we were slower than the rest of the passengers, we had nowhere to sit. We had a taxi booked to meet us at Naples and had considerable difficulty and expense arranging the cancelling of this and giving the taxi firm the estimated time that we would be landing in Naples. Eventually we landed at 11.15 pm and then arrived in Sorrento and checked in to our Hotel at 12.15 am the following morning. After this complete travesty we attempted to claim compensation for the 8 hour delay ordeal. This is now proving difficult. Meridiana is unbelievable and, believe me, I wouldn't touch them.

### "encountered no problems"
I flew with my husband and three year old daughter from New JFK to Palermo direct round trip. We encountered no problems on either leg. Now, we may have been lucky (I don't know) but flights left on time and arrived on time. Check in was very easy at both airports. Luggage was promptly received and cabin crew kind and courteous. What I want to explain to travelers is that you cannot expect top-notch luxury service from them while onboard. Let's be realistic. A ticket from JFK to PMO direct cost me $800/pp whereas Delta/Alitalia wanted $1,500 to connect in between. Traveling with a small child, I was more than happy to have the direct flight at half the cost. It is a no-frills plane. I asked for milk and there was none. The plane is old but we had no problems. There was one TV going to PMO (like flying in the "old days") where you had to watch what was playing. On the return, there was no TV at all. 9.5 hours without entertainment makes for a long flight. The seats in coach are uncomfortable. Narrow and small so if you are not prepared to deal with that, this is not the airline for you. Food was mediocre. No alcohol, wine only served with the meal and you got a light snack before landing. All in all - this airline is good if you can accept no-frills flying. The beauty is that you get to Palermo direct and at half the cost of the larger carriers. Would I fly them again? Probably if the price is right.

### "no clear directions"
Flew Naples to London Gatwick with Meridiana. The staff were courteous, friendly and helpful. However, the pilot aborted the flight after two attempts to take off, saying that a problem was signalled. We had to leave the plane and wait in the airport for 7+ hours. We were given a ticket for lunch in the "Meridiana cafe" which does not exist. All the staff at the other restaurants were unfriendly when asked if we could use our ticket. There were no clear directions. All passengers were milling around looking for the cafÃ©, being directed up and down, most carrying hand luggage, some elderly. Finally, a waitress at one cafÃ© directed us to a Brioche bar next to where she worked where we were abruptly given a bagette and drink. The plane seemed old. The seat in front of mine was slightly twisted to that the back would not go upright. The flight was cheap but I am not sure that I would risk flying Meridiana again.

### "courteous and helpful"
I travel almost monthly from Milano to Munich and I appreciate the service and punctuality of the Meridiana flight. The flight is convenient as it leaves in mid afternoon from Linate, the city airport, and it is always on time also on the return from Munich. Flight assistants are courteous and helpful. Only drawback is that in Milano the plane does not disembark to a finger but uses a bus shuttle. I imagine that this is done to save money as fingers are more expensive. At least this usually translates into cheap fares compared to aother travel options as car or train. As it is not a low-cost carrier Meridiana has the advantage of the possibilty to check-in at the airport at no extra cost.

### "every second is horrible"
New York to Naples with Meridiana. Every second of the process, from booking the ticket online until the plane lands was horrible. Bad customer service, old planes and zero organization. If it weren't for their direct flight from NY to Naples, I would not use this airline. In the future, I will be glady connecting through anywhere instead of flying direct with Meridiana.

### "my emails were returned!"
Prior to the booking I called to Meridiana 2 times to confirm that my flight from Milan to Sharm el Sheik return in April 2016 will not be cancelled. So I booked and in addition I booked 2 connection flights from the UK and the hotel in Italy for my family of 4. Three weeks before flight my flight to Egypt was cancelled so we lost around 200GBP in booked flights plus the alternative route was 200GBP more! I contacted Meridiana many times by emails and calls requesting to get a compensation, but my emails were returned! Very disappointed!

### "won't be troubling with my custom "
My first experience of Meridiana was to book a flight from London to Naples well in advance. 5 months later I got an email saying my flight had been cancelled. I had to call their call centre in Italy where it took the operator ten minutes to find my booking - all racking up call charges. The only alternative they could offer was on another day, so I requested a refund and rebooked with BA. That cost me an extra 70 GBP and I'm not looking forward to the phone bill. I won't be troubling Meridiana with my custom again.

### "would fly Meridiana again"
Although Meridiana is very basic, we had great experiences flying New York JFK to Naples and back a few weeks ago. Check in was quick and efficient at both airports, and they let me check my somewhat large (although within allowance) carry-on free of charge both ways. The seats though are tiny. I'm 5'10, and my boyfriend is 6'1", and if we had known we would have paid extra for the "comfort" seats with extra legroom. For a long flight to Italy, this was not ideal. But I should have done my homework so I can't blame the airline. The plane was a Boeing 767 both ways, and was old and sort of dirty, but quiet and it was a smooth flight both ways. The food was fine on the way into Naples, but on the way home it was atrocious. The flight crew is totally uninvolved and stays at the back of the plane for the duration of the flight, but when they did come around for meals and beverages, they were pleasant enough. The movies were corny romantic comedies, but deal-able. All in all, I got what I paid for - a $600 round trip ticket to Italy is not something I'm going to complain about. The trip there was better than the trip home, but I would fly Meridiana again in the future for the value alone.

### Meridiana customer review
Uncomfortable seats, poor drink selection. I asked for a scotch and I was told they do not serve super alcohol. If you are operating business class service you should stock your inflight bar with booze. I know many customers do not like to drink but if you provide service from New York you should cater to your clientele! They don't provide any snacks in business class - not acceptable.

### Meridiana customer review
Flew to Sardinia island and back with my girlfriend for my summer holidays. One hour delay on the outbound flight and confused boarding (we had to stand in the finger for 15 minutes as they started to board but plane was not ready yet), flight operated by old MD-80, I guess one of the last flying in the European skies nowadays but well maintained and with comfortable seats. Return flight was better with newer Boeing 737 and arrival ahead of schedule. Check-in was a breeze both in Bergamo and Olbia. Service onboard is extremely basic but cannot complain about the crew members who were polite and professional. Pilots were not very talkative though. Would consider to fly them only for short domestic flights as they have a good network in Italy.

### Meridiana customer review
I've flown Meridiana a few times now, and have always had a great experience. They're certainly no-frills, but for almost what it costs to fly from New York to LA, I can fly to Naples non-stop and have a free checked bag. Food is good, and airport/in-flight staff are always pleasant. Any kind of online or phone customer service is basically nonexistent, so I only book if I'm sure of where I want to go and am ready to eat the cost if something goes wrong, but with prices this low I won't complain.

### Meridiana customer review
We booked our flight in January. When we called, we requested and purchased an infant bassinet. When we arrived at the airport, we confirmed our bassinet. When we got on the plane, we were not in a bassinet seat. They gave us the option of having our infant sit in front of other people but would not ask the people to switch seats with us. We were then told that the seats that are in front of the bassinets are extra leg room and we need to purchase them in advance. We would have, if we had been told. Instead, I was stuck holding my son for 9 hours. While we were in Italy, we continuously called the airline to confirm our seats for the return flight. We were shuffled around by customer service, left on hold, then hung up on. Because we couldn't speak to anyone to have it taken care of, we went to the airport early to make sure we did not run into any problems again. We booked our bassinet and the extra leg room seats. Row 35. We get on the plane, and again, they messed up. The bassinet was in front of seats a and b and h and I. They gave us seats d and e. Luckily, the people who were in the bassinet seats were nice and switched with us. There was a man with an infant on the plane who ran into the same problem we did on our way out. There was one working bathroom on the whole plane, it was not cleaned at all in the 10 hours we were on board. The crew was notified by many passengers but they did not clean it. They went in to change toilet paper rolls and tissues, so they saw how disgusting it was. If you wanted a drink, you had to go to the back of the plane and and get it from the cart, while the flight attendants ignored you. I thought it would be better to fly direct to Sicily and this airline was the only option. In the future, I would rather have a layover than deal with this terrible airline.

### Meridiana customer review
Travelling on my own with my 2.5 year old who was sitting on own paid seat which the flight attendant tried to accuse us of taking up the space. All other airlines including budget airlines like Easyjet and Ryan Air allow you to bring a stroller and check in a car seat. If flying with Meridiana - you have to either use your luggage allowance or pay for it. So not family friend for those with small children. Planes are not well-maintained. They are aging and grubby. Mixed interaction with staff, half of which were not happy to be on a full flight filled with a lot of kids. I will not be flying this airline again.

### Meridiana customer review
Not happy with return flight. I bought tickets 6 months ago, family of four traveling together and reserved row 17 with seats together. They shoved us all almost completely in the back of the plane and split us up including my children. We tried to ask the flight attendants for some help but there was none. We just had to figure it out on our own. Was able to get my kids together at least because they had split up another 2 people and by just swapping seats in the same row it put family members together. You are at their will and the couldn't care less. As far as the mechanics of their jobs everyone performed as expected and there were no problems. I realize the seat assignments are not their responsibility but it might have been nice to have a little assistance and understanding.

### Meridiana customer review
Flt 3933 April 22 2015 JFK-PMO. Flt 3932 April 30 2015 PMO-JFK. From the staff at the check-in counter at JFK to the flight crew on the aircraft I have never had a more wonderful experience! Everyone had a smile of greeting and friendly "welcome aboard". The stewardesses on the JFK-Palermo portion were terrific. While in Italy I fractured my ankle and had to fly home with a cast and crutches. I was met curbside at Palermo airport by an assistant with a wheelchair who accompanied me onto the aircraft. The stewards took over from there and saw to my every comfort even to guiding me to the lavatory! They even changed my seat to allow me to elevate my injured leg. I would highly recommend.

FCO-OLB-FCO. Meridiana uses the MD80 on this route I think it's a wonderful machine very silent on the front but quite noisy on the back. Cabin crew professional and polite always smiling except one on the return flight that seemed bored and completely uninterested. On the first leg we left FCO on time and we arrived 30 minutes early! the return was on time also. Very satisfied I hope I'll fly them again.

### Meridiana customer review
We flew from JFK to Napoli and we had an excellent flight. The flights were on time and the staff was very nice. The flight attendants were some of the nicest that we have ever had. We will definitely fly with them again next summer!

### Meridiana customer review
I took the flight MXP-MRU last month and I found it comfortable value-for-money and competitive versus other Italian carriers when it comes to the service and comfort on board. Quite comfortable seats very attentive staff and delicious meals together with a competitive price was a nice surprise. There is no inflight entertainment but in business they hand out iPads which somehow makes up for it.

I flew from Olbia to Paris CDG. Overall positive feedback service on board was good and flight attendants proved to be really helpful. Only negative part is arriving at CDG terminal 3 a very poor infrastructure.

### Meridiana customer review
Awful airline! I flew to Olbia on the 30th of August 2014 and returned 6th September. On the way out after booking we got informed our flight had changed from 16.00h to 08.00h giving us almost one whole day less on holiday. When leaving London Gatwick we arrived at the airport 2hours prior to out given departure time 18.50h to find the flight was not at 20.40h (approx). This change meant that we arrived to Olbia at 00.30 where our car rental desk was closed our apartment did not answer calls and all surrounding hotels cost at least 150 euro! Not to add customer service on our ancient plane was terrible luckily this had improved on out return. Our first night of holiday was a disaster thanks to this airline and then in addition with was cut from 7 to 6 days.

### Meridiana customer review
I flew more than a few times from Cagliari-Linate and Alghero-Linate. Planes used were mostly old McDonnell- Douglas MD-80 although the company has recently renewed seats and overall furniture flying on these planes still has an 80's flavor. On MD-80 seats are ok but a very tall person could feel somewhat unease. There is not a lot of space for the hand-luggage on the over-head lockers. Meridiana also own much newer and more comfortable Airbus A320 but they are less numerous than MD-80s. On the numerous flight I took I don't remember major delays. Staff was always nice. Snacks and Drinks service could be improved. Overall I will for sure fly again with Meridiana but for flights from Sardinia to the Peninsula I will always prefer Alitalia.

### Meridiana customer review
LIN-OLB on Aug 11th back on Aug 23rd. First time flying with them a kind of throw back to the 80's flight experience. They had a sort of monopoly for flights to Sardinia Island before EasyJet came in as a new player still very strong on this route. Onward leg on time but terrible seat pitch on the MD82: the flight is short about 1hr otherwise it would have been painful. The dedicated counter for baggage drop off was left unattended so only one queue in Linate: check-in procedures looked slower than I am used to with other airlines but luckily there were not so many people waiting for being registered. Return leg delayed 15 minutes again an old MD82 with slightly better leg room. Staff were polite nothing more. Drinks were served quickly after take off. Ticket was expensive (300EUR) because of the peak of the holidays season: Easyjet was offering more or less the same rate but with lower baggage allowance and departing from MXP which is far away from my hometown. Not my favorite airline for sure but I will probably give them a second chance. Olbia Costa Smeralda airport is a brand new shiny and pleasant place: this was the best part of my trip actually.

### Meridiana customer review
Flight from London Gatwick to Olbia and back. Plane delayed about 45 mins going out. No explanation. Poorest leg room of any airline I've travelled with. No inflight information. Otherwise ok. On the way back. Well I'm typing this in the check-in queue. I've been queuing for 90 minutes so far. No explanations offered. They seem to be taking about 15 mins to check in each passenger. Original flight time shown as delayed by 30 mins. They will need more than that at this rate of check in. If there is a problem surely someone has the customer service initiative to tell us.

### Meridiana customer review
Having only ever flown with Easyjet before to Italy I decided to fly Meridiana to Naples from Gatwick North Terminal and was pleasantly surprised. The fare included a 23kg free bag which when added onto to the cost of Easyjet made it more expensive than Meridiana. Check-in at North Terminal was easy and quick and the boarding process at the gate was efficient and in staggered boarding from the back. On board the seats were comfortable and room for me at 6ft2" tall. There was a complimentary onboard service of sandwich and soft drinks which was adequate and again saved money. Cabin crew were attentive and not too many announcements which you can get on some LCC.

### Meridiana customer review
I would call it a disastrous experience if there was any. They simply cancelled their flight on 7 August 2014 between Moscow and Naples Italy without offering any alternatives. The story behind this was (as I heard) that due to weather conditions their plane landed in a different airport in Moscow and for some reasons they could not or did not want to relocate it to the proper one. What a good partner for BA! Never fly Meridiana!

### Meridiana customer review
Flight out of JFK was scheduled for 3 pm and didn't leave until 5 but we got upgraded to bulkhead seats across the front row which was nice. Seats are a little narrow but food and wine was delicious (surprising for airline food) and we arrived only one hour late (7 am instead of 6). Coming home from Naples fullL flight. Bigger plane (40 rows) I think going there was a little smaller (but we were toward the front so not sure). Anyway it was on time and a great smooth flight. And arrived 45 min ahead of schedule. Would recommend Air Italy and/or Meridiana. No issues at all with luggage or accommodations.

### Meridiana customer review
I had used Meridiana before with no problems at all good enough service no delay no comments on the food because I do not eat on planes anyway so far so good. I bought another ticket from Meridiana from Olbia to Gatwick and to my surprise the flight was from Blue Air a Romania airline company. The airplane was at least 25 years old very noisy inside air con blowing hot air when you need cold air really. I'd rather pay more and travel with Meridiana. If I had known that when you by Meridiana it does not mean that you fly with them I would not have bought the ticket.

### Meridiana customer review
Notwithstanding full price tickets bought months in advance Meridiana fly changed the flight schedule for the second consecutive year thus messing up my plans and partially ruining my holiday. The average low level of customer satisfaction found on the web alerted me but I tried last year the company because of its no stop flight to Crete. Due to the above mentioned schedule change that I may suppose is caused by intentional overbooking they made me lose one day of holiday. Monitors were turned off at check in so that it was difficult to find the proper line that was interminable and badly assisted. It took more than one hour to clear it. Aircraft was not properly cleaned and seats were uncomfortable. This year despite a sharp increase in prices the trick was just the same: they sold an evening ticket and pretended to re-program us on the morning flight. The call center answers after 15-20 minutes and they say they can't help. Never again on Meridiana.

### Meridiana customer review
Recently flew Meridiana to Naples from New York. Could not have been more impressed with the service and timeliness of the flights. Would fly this airline again any time.

### Meridiana customer review
I flew yesterday from MRU to FCO on the B767-300 (763) registered I-AIGG. When I read the reviews on here I was a bit worried about the flight. Its true the flight was fours hours late and I didn't receive any notification from Meridiana. For a planned 6am flight four hours makes a big difference when you need to wake up early. I checked with the airport and they advised to come four hours later. The flight itself was fine. The economy seats are high density but they are comfortable. The crew were excellent and really did a good job throughout the flight. Food-wise it was fine but for a 10.5 hour flight the offerings were a little thin. The addition of a free service bar would be a useful addition.

### Meridiana customer review
We have just returned from Cagliari to LGW. In view of the really cheap prices and previous poor reviews I had low expectations. Check in was a breeze at LGW and Cagliari flight took off on time. Ok the seats did not have much leg room but we hadn't paid first class prices by a long way. Amazingly we were served free coffee soft drinks and a snack! will definitely use again.

### Meridiana customer review
We had excellent flights on Meridiana as we traveled from JFK to Naples and back. The plane appeared to be fairly new and the cabin clean. I might also add that the departure flight and the return both arrived ahead of schedule. There were 6 flight attendants on the return flight to JFK including 4 stewards and 2 stewardesses. They were particularly attentive and the food they served was excellent. Beverages flowed throughout most of the trip and that included complimentary wine. We flew Economy class and had no issues at all. If you are considering a flight with Meridiana do not hesitate they exceeded our expectations.

### Meridiana customer review
We flew from Malta to Naples via Catania. The seat space on both legs was very small there was no customer service. We got our first leg boarding pass in Malta but were told we had to get a boarding pass for the second leg in Catania. Even though our baggage was forwarded through to Naples. There is no transit desk in Catania (there is a well identified Transfer desk but it is not used). The service at the Meridiana desk was very poor. The service staff were rude and unhelpful. I will never use Meridiana again!

### Meridiana customer review
My family and I traveled from NYC to Naples in July 2013. Departure time was delayed 3.5 hrs. Once we arrived at the terminal there were no Meridiana representatives to advise the crowd of waiting passengers. This is the first sign that this is the norm for Meridiana - constant delays of 3-4 hrs for every flight out of JFK to Italy. The company did not offer any vouchers for drinks or food. Finally at 11 pm a Meridiana supervisor showed up with limited information. Once you finally board the plane be ready to feel like you have gone back in time by 30 years. Meridiana uses a fleet of Air Italy airplanes. These planes are very old and dirty. My family and I would rather fly to Rome or Milan and then to Naples or better yet to Dublin and then Naples with Aer Lingus.

### Meridiana customer review
My family and I just returned from Napoli to NYC. My husband and I were traveling with 3 small children. When we arrived at check in more than 2.5 hours in advance we were told that we were not listed on the flight. We had our flight confirmation in hand. The 5 seats they assigned to us on the airplane were nowhere near each other. My children were assigned seats on their own! I have never heard of such a thing. Their excuse for our seating assignments was that we checked in late. We were one of the first people in line. Each staff member passed this problem onto the next from check in to boarding until we were standing in the aisle of the plane minutes before it took off. They were only able to sit me with one of my children and my husband with another. My third child I had to have sit with a family friend who were 40 rows in front of me. I would never fly with them again after today's experience.

### Meridiana customer review
Last Saturday I flew Milan Linate-Olbia Costa Smeralda. Originally booked the early morning flight but was rescheduled on the next flight. No explanation or other option given. Meridiana still operates the old MD80: my plane was at least 20 years old and did show its age - no in flight entertainment at all - even the in flight magazine was missing. Seats are quite comfortable though. Cabin crew looked lazy - coffee tea water and juices free of charge. Prices are way too high but on this route they are the only ones flying. Talks by itself. If you can avoid it.

### Meridiana customer review
Naples to New York. The service was the worst I have experienced. We had to wait over 2 hrs to receive any drinks. When they finally came around I asked for some water and the flight attendant said he only had tea. I had to get up and ask another flight attendant for some water and he just pointed at the pitcher as he continued to play with his ipod. All three of us applied for the hifly program a month before flying and never got an email back with the frequent flyer number. I called a week before going on the flight with some questions about changing our seats to make sure the 5 year old was seated with us together and were told by a very annoyed representative that we had to pay 20 euros per person to select a seat by phone. I have never experienced such poor service.

### Meridiana customer review
I flew from Rome to Olbia and back with my family of 4. For FCO-OLB leg I purchased the ticket for the mid- day flight. It got cancelled and we had to take the evening flight as others here have reported. That flight was delayed for more than an hour so we arrived much later than anticipated. Our baggage was delayed for more than 3 days.

### Meridiana customer review
Both our flights Naples-Olbia and Cagliari-Rome were cancelled at short notice without explanation and both were rescheduled for several hours later. Consequently we spent a lot of our Sardinian holiday hanging around airports. Very disappointing considering we had booked and paid for these flights several months in advance and planned our holiday to suit. It seems they offer a variety of flight times to sucker you in then cancel them all for a single evening flight. They had our phone numbers but just didn't bother. A long way to come from Australia to suffer poor service.

### Meridiana customer review
We flew LGW-FLR FLR-LGW. Outbound slightly delayed with no explanation. Return unremarkable. This carrier offers a great value but deceptive pricing. Beware that although the "transportation document" you receive by way of receipt when you buy a ticket says "first checked bag is â‚¬17" what they mean is "first checked bag is â‚¬17 if you pay online in advance and print out your confirmation of payment otherwise at check-in you will be asked to pay â‚¬35+â‚¬5 ticketing fee at the ticket counter in FLR then to return to the check-in counter with your receipt to check your bags. Since flights booked LGW-FLR-LGW are not eligible for online check-in it is easy to miss that (1) there may be another extra Web App elsewhere on meridiana.it you may be able to use to pre-pay for luggage and (2) there may be a different price for checked bagage paid for at the airport than the price indicated on the receipt you receive when you buy a ticket. We bought an extremely cheap ticket (Â£214 round trip for two pax) but I would have preferred that they bundle in this extra effective â‚¬23 surcharge for being a non-expert into the ticket price. It makes them look slimy to advertise a product at one price and to actually charge a difference price. Flight was unremarkable; seats cramped but manageable staff friendly enough. Most seats don't recline very much.

### Meridiana customer review
Just returned from Florence. Check in at Gatwick - brilliant flight on time good service no problem. Return flight: At check in we were told our pre paid (40 euro) extra leg room seats were not there and we were given separate single seats on the plane. Eventually it got sorted no explanation why we had to fight to get what we had paid for. We had two screaming babies sat behind us. This family had the use of five seats and only paid for two. Would I fly Meridiana again - no. Would I recommend them - no.

### Meridiana customer review
Disgraceful to tell people with children and babies to check in two hours before a flight to keep them waiting one hour for staff to turn up which ultimately delayed the flight. Found Meridiana staff disinterested in passengers and more concerned with how they were looking in as much as they allowed the passenger sitting outside of me to keep two large bags at her feet which made it almost impossible for me to get out. This happened on our flight to Florence and back to Gatwick where this practise seemed the norm. Curtains used to divide classes were not drawn back before landing and the passenger in front of me was not reminded to bring his seat upright on landing. We have travelled worldwide for many years and this has to be the worst flight we have ever taken staff need re-training in air safety and people skills.

### Meridiana customer review
I went from Florence to Gatwick just a few days ago. Boarding went well the staff even helped with checking a tripod as extra luggage without paying a fee for it. Onboard one of the male steward looked somewhat irritated but that is to be expected. We arrived on time and I found no serious issues. Would recommended to others.

### Meridiana customer review
Travelled from Turin - Catania return with an infant under 2yrs old. Check in smooth and flight left on time and even landed early both ways. Crew were friendly and even gave drinks on board at no extra cost which is not bad for a low-cost airline. Flight from Catania to Turin was on new A319 and had no problems. We have taken Meridiana a few times now and have never had any problems and would recommend.

### Meridiana customer review
Was scheduled for an 8.10pm flight from JFK direct to Palermo on July 9th. The fact that they flew direct was the reason for selecting this airline - big mistake! They phone that morning to say the flight was canceled until the next morning at 9.30am arriving in Palermo at 12.30am. There was no attempt by them to put us on another airline that evening even if we had to connect in Rome Milan etc. They said they were only co- share with KLM and that KLM did not fly to Palermo. These change of their plans totally messed up my vacation and the only thing they did was offer a full refund which I took and canceled my trip and will reschedule with another major carrier.

### Meridiana customer review
My husband and I travelled to and from Sardinia in June. The trip from Olbia to Rome was a nightmare. Our flight which was due at 11 am was cancelled without any explanation. We had to get up at 4.30 to be able to get another flight to Rome. There we had to wait 7 hours with our luggage waiting for our flight to Lisbon. Sardinia is beautiful but is not worth the hassle. Our trip was completely ruined when we eventually got to Lisbon about 6pm. We'll never fly with Meridiana again that's for sure.

### Meridiana customer review
Gatwick to Florence return. Very nice Airbus A319 with leather seats. Very easy check-in at Gatwick and flight on time. Soft drink tea and savoury or sweet biscuits offered. Very easy check-in at Florence and again flight on time. Same Soft drink tea and savoury or sweet biscuits offered. Thought they were one of the better airlines we have travelled on.

### Meridiana customer review
London GTW to Florence. Flight delayed 4 hours and diverted to Pisa because Meridiana brought a plane too big to land at Florence. No apologies or explanation from staff or the crew. Every staff answered "it is not my fault". We were forced to take a bus offered by Meridiana from Pisa to Florence but no staff explained where the buses were and passengers had to walk around the Pisa airport parking lot to find them. The worst flight experience ever.

### Meridiana customer review
Moscow-Bologna. This is one of the very few direct flights from Moscow to Italy. The check-in procedure was fast and the plane left on time. Plane was an Airbus which I like more than Boeing because they seem less noisy. Staff were nice and they served a drink and snack. Basic service but the price was more than ok. However they only speak Italian and English not Russian which is a pity on a flight to Moscow.

### Meridiana customer review
The outward flight was ok landed 20 minutes late. The return flight was awful. Nearly 4 hours delayed and felt we could have been informed by text before arriving at the airport. Onboard service is the worst I have had. No drinks other than soft and staff barely spoke English the captains welcome onboard was a surly glance as we walked up the gangway. It was an unpleasant flight and would not fly them again. Very unprofessional and BA who we believed we would be flying with needs to address this.

### Meridiana customer review
Gatwick to Florence return. No problems with check-in staff flight departures or arrivals. Served a soft drink and crackers on the plane which is all we expected for a short flight.

### Meridiana customer review
Having had a great outbound flight and reviewed it as such I was a bit apprehensive about our return flight from Florence to Gatwick. Nothing to worry about as it was also fine. Left on time arrived at Gatwick a few minutes early. Efficient check in at Florence airport and friendly service on board. Only comment is that we had paid for extra legroom seats by the emergency exit and mine was by the window and it is a different design from the others in the row and was uncomfortable. Fortunately we were able to move to other seats in the same row across the aisle. So I would suggest you avoid a window seat by emergency exit - maybe we were just very lucky.

### Meridiana customer review
No problems with our flight to Florence. Friendly check-in flight left on time and arrived 10 mins early. Seats more comfortable than expected and light refreshments served suitable for a 2 hr flight. We were a bit worried having read so many bad reviews and hope our return flight is as good as the outgoing one.

### Meridiana customer review
Charter Flight from Muh (Marsa Matrouh) to FCO (Rome). Left a bit late. Flight attendants put the front toilet 'out of order' throughout the duration of the flight. Plane was so crowded that a long queue was present to use the rear toilets. Some tray tables were broken and passengers were asked to put the tray with their meal on their knees.

### Meridiana customer review
I fly a lot and this had to be the worst flight I've ever been on. The flight was late taking off when I boarded the plan I found out they had given my seat away. I then had to stand at the front of the plane until the entire flight boarded so they could find me an unused seat to which they said 'I'm sure you'll be able to stay on this flight'. Afterwards due to a mishap with my belongings I had to call the airline company several times. Not only did I have to wait 15-20 mins each time to speak to someone they would then proceed to tell me complaints and questions can't be made over the phone.

### Meridiana customer review
Outbound flight was on time. Upgraded to Business excited until we got on the plane. Upgrade allowed a seat with a bit more legroom but only qualified for one free soft drink and small packet of crackers. On the return check-in was fine and nice staff. We eventually got on board after 25 mins on the bus. We were about to take off when the pilot slammed the brakes on. We taxied to the Meridiana hanger were the problem was fixed. Lack of information and not offered extra drinks or food to compensate. These were not cheap flights and I think that the service offered was very poor and would definitely not travel with them again.

### Meridiana customer review
Service was not good time keeping both ways was poor and on the return a delay of 6 hrs with little information from staff. Very expensive for what it was only soft drinks and a small pack of biscuits both journeys. Thought it would be better considering BA share this flight.

### Meridiana customer review
Returned last night after a long weekend in Florence. Polite staff and great flight outward from Gatwick on time and with complimentary drinks and snacks. Great flight back from Florence bit of a delay at check in but no delays leaving. Early arrival at Gatwick meant we stacked to go in but this was not the airlines fault. Having read reviews before trip we were rather concerned that we might have a bad experience but this was not the case at all. This was a pleasant experience and we will use Meridiana again for our return to Florence in the coming months.

### Meridiana customer review
Business class with Meridiana to Florence. Trip out fine no problem trip back a disaster with passengers crowded onto buses and left on the tarmac in 100 degrees heat for 35 mins before the flight boarded. Delayed for 4 hrs at Florence with no information rude staff and passengers left wandering about lost. Eventually an incoming plane pressed into service and the flight re-boarded with the same bus procedure as before. No catering available on a filthy plane and the two cabin crew informed us they had been dragged in from standby. Didn't offer drinks until forced to by irate passengers and spent the first 30mins of the flight giggling behind the curtains in Economy.

### Meridiana customer review
I have always been a fan because of the Gatwick-Florence link but after the third consecutive disaster no more. Gatwick's departures website had the flight as severely delayed but BA kept saying they knew nothing about a delay and would not re-book. The Meridiana rep had just gone home and not bothered to tell BA.

### Meridiana customer review
LGW-FLR one way. The flight was delayed by 4 hrs something we only discovered after security. There were no announcements or explanations and no-one from Meridiana ever came to explain or offer vouchers. BA staff (with whom I had booked as codeshare) refused to help at all except calling for Meridiana agents who never came. On board the flight there was no food and my seat had two large bumps that dug into me for the whole flight. Refreshments were limited to one glass of coke orange juice or water and there was not a single announcement or apology from the flight deck. Finally on arrival at FLR there was no airport bus so we were obliged to take taxis at a cost of nearly 30 Euros to the centre of town.

### Meridiana customer review
Florence-Cagliaria. Aged and shabby A319 but flights on time and flight attendants helpful with complimentary drinks. On the whole no problems with this short flight and reasonable value for money.

### Meridiana customer review
I did not think twice when I saw that my BA flight from Gatwick-Florence was being operated by Meridiana however I will not fly with them again. We were unable to check in on-line cabin baggage has a weight limit that was not mentioned on the BA website meaning that our bags had to be checked as they were slightly over the limit. The on board conditions were a lot more cramped and very uncomfortable compared to BA and the overall service from start to finish was lacking. The return flight from Florence-Gatwick was carnage at check in with it taking well over 1hr of queuing up to finally complete the process. The flight ending up being delayed but without any explanation or communication. If I go back to Florence then I will find another route or airline.

### Meridiana customer review
I have never flown with such an incompetent airline that flies under the banner of British Airways. Both carriers should be ashamed at the level of customer service provided. The flight was Florence-Gatwick scheduled to leave at 6:05 p.m. finally taking off after 11:00 p.m. The excuses for the delay varied from a private jet interfering with commercial liners taking off on the runway instrument failure need to refuel crew change and final clearance. We were rudely told to leave the check-in area for "Passport" check shuttled around in people movers to the plane and during the re-fuelling and never provided with adequate information about what was happening. At one point we were told that the police had ordered people off the plane creating confusion that there might have been a serious incident. Our delay caused problems for us in making our rental car time and in obtaining a hotel accommodations. We were required to sleep on the side of the road at 4 in the morning as a result! Advice: Check your BA ticket before flying and make sure you aren't flying Meridiana!

### Meridiana customer review
Do not fly with this airline! Our return flight got relocated to Pisa from Florence. There was limited to zero communication. No one seemed to know what was going on. We had to pay to be transferred to Pisa Airport via coach. We were not supplied with a meal. Once we finally boarded the plane we had to disembark to identify our bags. Awful airline. Do not use.

### Meridiana customer review
I bought 4 electronic tickets for my 2 children (one of them already pays as an adult) my wife and me for travelling from Barcelona to Florence. I had received the four ETKT numbers long before the travel date and the four of us presented on Barcelona airport well before the boarding time. When we arrived to the counter the agent told me that only three people could travel. The only explanation that he was ready to give was that one of my four tickets "had not been issued" which was ridiculous because I could show him the four ETKT numbers. Despite I had the four ETKTs he made me call my travel agency who confirmed that the 4 tickets had been equally issued at the same time and suggested me to tell the Meridiana agent that he should try to "open" the ticket he was refusing to accept. The agent refused to "open" the tickets but in the end for some magical reason they decided to accept the ticket and we could travel to Florence although the boarding card seemed to be refused by the machines at the boarding room and one of us was seated 10 rows behind the rest of the family. For the return travel I double checked with the travel agency and ticket office at Florence about the validity of the 4 ETKTs. At check in they punished me again by giving me a seat 10+ rows behind the rest of my family. The service on board was correct. The punctuality was OK. But can I trust the next time that they will let me travel?

### Meridiana customer review
LGW-FLR trip. Planes on time. Friendly cabin crew. Free snack and drink. Seats bigger and more leg-room than low cost airlines. Easy and cheap bus connection to and from Florence centre. All in all a great experience.

### Meridiana customer review
Shocking will never book with this airline again. Arrived at Gatwick in plenty of time for a flight to Florence but told that check in was closed as the flight was full although I had booked 3 months earlier had chosen my seat that morning online (although full online booking was not available) and arrived while check in was open with plenty of time to spare. They had over booked the flight and informed me that I had missed out. My experience of this happening before with more reputable airlines is that you are offered good compensation packages for having your flight cancelled. Not so with Meridiana. I am in the process of applying for compensation but don't rate my chances. I eventually flew to Bologna and was transferred to Florence the next day losing 16 hours of a weekend trip even though my flight left on time. Four other people on my flight suffered the same misfortune. Avoid this airline.

### Meridiana customer review
Gatwick-Florence return with Meridiana - can't complain about anything. Everything was hassle free. Crew and flight was fabulous free light refreshments on board. Extra leg space than normal.

### Meridiana customer review
Disgraceful service for an airline that uses a BA codeshare. Arrived in Florence from London 6 hours late after flying to Bologna (not Florence) and then bus to Florence - never found out why. Despite being 'business' class the on-board service was practically non-existent. I think this is a cheap airline pretending to be better than it is.

### Meridiana customer review
Horrible. On return flight from Florence to Gatwick the check-in seemed to be taking ages. We realised that everyone was being told that they hadn't paid for luggage to go into the hold - news to us. We were all charged 15 euros per suitcase even though there had been no charge on the way out. This caused a lot of anger and distress. When I got home I checked my booking and it said first suitcase was free. Now beginning the long process of claiming back my money. Never again.

### Meridiana customer review
I booked 2 tickets for Amsterdam to Florence for September 2011. I read that Meridiana stopped this route by March 28th 2001. Trying to reach Meridiana by telephone is impossible. Either they hang up the phone or they don't pick up the phone. Emails are not answered. I don't know if this unfriendly company will pay back or not. Never book with this unreliable airline company!

London-Florence Return. Outward bound was satisfactory. Return flight was cancelled once we were at the airport and placed on a flight from Bologna. Waited in line for 1.5 hours to check in then put on a bus and undertook baggage drop and security at Bologna. Just be aware that your flight may not leave from the city you booked for.

### Meridiana customer review
I booked two tickets from Amstedam to Florence and back (14th/21st April). Two weeks ago I received notice from Meridiana that my flights have been cancelled. Since then I have been trying to get a refund. I sent three e-mails to an address I had been given by a staff member of customer care. No answer! I called again today only to hear that I should have called instead of sending an e-mail. That is the silliest excuse I have ever heard. I wanted to use an e-mail because then at least you can prove that you have claimed a refund. Today I finally succeeded in getting confirmation of the refund but the amount is much less than what I have paid for the tickets. So I have sent another e-mail. My hopes are not high. I am never going to book a ticket with this dodgy airline again. I have booked two new tickets with KLM which I should have done in the fist place. Of course the KLM tickets are much more expensive now than they were months ago when I booked my Meridiana flights.

### Meridiana customer review
OLB-BLQ on MD-80 seats cramped but fine for a short flight. Service was one drink (coke orange juice or water) no snack. The biggest gripe with Meridiana is that they charge high fares but are in practice a no-frills airline. On a number of domestic routes you even need to pay extra for checked baggage as it is the case with low cost carriers. They have a sort of monopoly in Olbia so you don't have much choice.

My experience was an efficient airline on time both ways to/from Florence. More leg room than many airlines. Refreshments were free and adequate for such a short journey.

### Meridiana customer review
I really hate this airline sometimes. No major beef with the aircraft (I have only ever flown long haul on decent A330 aircraft) but the organization of the airline is terrible. It is basically impossible to speak to anyone who knows what they are doing or that has access to necessary information. Three times now I have attempted to book (either during reservation or after) bassinet row seats or biz upgrade only to be told that it is all full up and not possible. You get to the flight and find empty seats. Furthermore they want to sell the bulkhead seats for 45 euros but will not prioritise for people with young children. So first come first served basically. On the upside in biz I ate the best food I have had on a plane for a long time. Good antipasti great pasta and decent second course meat as well.

LGW-FLR flight was cancelled due to weather and we received no help nor information. No customer service no updates absolutely no response to phone email and other internet contact. Very unfriendly check in. We will never fly this airline again.

Milano Linate-Alghero return MD-82 Economy. Quite old aircraft average service30 mins delay on flight to Sardinia. This airline clearly needs improvement to offer a higher standard but it's ok if you just need to fly from Italy to Sardinia. Average crew.

### Meridiana customer review
Return flight to Gatwick from Florence very bad customer service echoing previous comments. 4 hour delay with little or no information due to bad weather and the inability to take off as mentioned before. This is the second time I have been delayed out of Florence in two trips so never again and never anywhere else with Meridiana.

### Meridiana customer review
We should have been on a BA flight to Florence but it was changed because of the deal done with Meridiana a big disappointment. However the seating was spacious and cabin clean. On Meridiana it would appear that nothing is provided in economy class. Drinks and snacks could be purchased. We did not discover all this until the return flight as there was a strike by the cabin staff on the outbound flight so when not even a trolley appeared word was passed by passengers around that a strike was on.

Gatwick to Florence and back the flight both were on time staff helpful and friendly and the seats on the plane had good legroom.

### Meridiana customer review
Terrible airline. We had a 7 hour delay on our 1.5 hour flight from Amsterdam to Florence on July 15th. Worst of all no information whatsoever. Very bad handling by KLM and Transavia that did not show up at the gate for the first 6 hours of the delay. We finally ended up flying to Pisa instead and getting "bussed" into Florence adding to the total delay of in the end over 8 hours! Don't try this it made us decide to buy an extra ticket and fly back the safe way from Rome.

### Meridiana customer review
Worst airline and customer service I have dealt with in my life! Delay of 12 hours without a warning - had to go back and forth between airport and then another delay. Phoned customer service in The Netherlands and Italy and they would not give an explanation - very rude.

### Meridiana customer review
My flight Florence to Gatwick was cancelled after initially being told that it was two hours late. There were no Meridiana staff available to offer assistance and the flight was not rescheduled. We were forced to wait at the ticket counter in Florence for three hours while all of the stranded passengers rebooked their flights with other carriers. Our cancelled two hour flight to London ended up costing my daughter and I two days of our vacation while this mess was sorted out not to mention extra transportation long distance and food costs.

### Meridiana customer review
I had two flights with them- London Florence and Naples- Olbia (Sardinia). Both were delayed 24 hours. At least with the first one we were in the UK and our rights were upheld. But for the Italian flights they treated us very badly pretending not to understand us even though an Italian passenger translated for us. As we found out later they breached regulations by not providing accommodation or a phone call even though at the time we did ask the supervisor. We were left stranded in Olbia at 2 am and ended up being ripped off by a taxi driver to the tune of â‚¬200. Between the two flights we lost two days of hotel bookings one day's car rental ran up a large mobile phone bill trying to sort it out with Meridiana etc. As an earlier poster described their offices are incredibly inefficient when you have a complaint. Some staff hang up if you speak English and none of them seem to know the right number for customer services. One spoiled holiday nine months six letters innumerable long distance calls and only a partial refund!

### Meridiana customer review
An uneventful return flight Amsterdam to Florence. Pleasant cabin staff drink and a good aircraft (A319). The return flight was cancelled due to volcanic ash over northern Italy. A staff member at the airport provided a telephone number to contact and using the mobile phone the flight was easily rebooked to the day after.
