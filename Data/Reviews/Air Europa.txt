### "they’ve refused to compensate"
My recent flight with this airline was a complete disaster. We faced a departure delay of over 4 hours and arrived nearly 4 hours late, yet the airline offered a meager €5 voucher — barely enough to cover a coffee during the long wait. That was the extent of their support. To make matters worse, no complimentary water was provided during the over 2-hour flight, leaving passengers uncomfortable and neglected. The lack of basic courtesy and care was shocking. What’s even more infuriating is the airline’s blatant disregard for EU passenger rights, which entitles travelers to compensation for significant delays. Despite this legal obligation, they’ve refused to compensate without providing any valid reason. I strongly advise anyone considering this airline to look elsewhere. No traveler deserves to be treated this way. I, at least, will not fly with them again.

### “Professional pleasant crew”
Very pleasant service on Madrid flight and Vigo flight. Professional pleasant crew, who were attentive and friendly. The food was of a good quality, nothing spectacular but good.

### "luggage not present on arrival"
Charge of 160€ more in Bogota for a violin in the cabin and in addition the luggage not present on arrival for passengers....how can you leave a plane one hour late without the luggage? Just 2 people behind a desk to take complaints from customers across the plane who don't have their suitcases on arrival. It's a shame. Space is limited between seats and on a 10 hour flight, we only had a small meal and a coffee and a glass of water. I find it light for a plane ticket costing €1,500 round trip. If you ask for an additional drink, you have to pay like headphones for the screens which are chargeable.... I also find a lack of consideration from the staff and I do not recommend this company. Facturation de 160€ en plus à Bogota pour un violon en cabine et en plus les bagages non présents à l'arrivée pour des passagers .. comment peut-on faire partir un avion en retard d'une heure sans les bagages ? Juste 2 personnes derrière un bureau pour prendre les plaintes des clients de l'ensemble de l'avion qui n'ont pas leurs valises à l'arrivée. C'est une honte. La place est limitée entre les sièges et sur un vol de 10h, nous avons eu uniquement un petit repas  et un café et un verre d'eau. Je trouve ça léger pour un billet d'avion à 1500€ aller retour. Si vous demandez une boisson supplémentaire, il faut payer comme les écouteurs pour les écrans qui sont payants.... Je trouve également un manque de considération du personnel et je ne recommande pas cette compagnie.

### "Incompetent and rude check-in agent"
Incompetent and rude check-in agent at Bogota's Air Europa counter. She refused to issue my boarding pass despite having all documentation necessary. Her inability to recognize my return ticket on Spanish airline World 2 fly and confusing it repetitively with Brazilian Gol was outrageous. After I requested assistance of her supervisor the problem was solved. It caused me a lot of stress and I almost missed the flight despite being 3 hours before departure at the counter. No apologies were given.

### "crew hardly ever left the galley"
The flight was delayed & so was our inbound Air Europa flight from Malaga. After boarding we were told there was a problem with the engine, they had to change the oil. We waited for over an hour. The first shock was how old the Entertainment system was, not even a Map! The Boeing 787-8 was battered, ducted tape everywhere, broken screens, even a broken seat at the end of the flight. Bits missing in the toilets & generally not very clean. Then came the selling of the headphones - the IFE was not working paying 3 euros for a set of headphones. The first meal service was not bad, the chicken is better than the pasta. But what I found incredible was there were no more free drinks. The crew hardly ever left the galley, they made themselves a little den with curtains. Towards the end of the almost 10 hour flight, we thought we would be getting some breakfast but just tea, coffee or orange juice, half filled as well.

### “Completely getting the runaround”
The customer service is beyond terrible. The check in process at the Lisbon Airport was atrocious. Three clerks with over one hundred people in line. We were at the airport 3 hours early and still almost missed our flight. Very stressful day. AFTER the flight, the customer service regarding getting a simple copy of my invoice has been a nightmare. I have been put on hold for over an hour TWICE before being disconnected. I have written emails and then being told to reach them through Facebook or Twitter. Completely getting the runaround. My head is ready to explode.

### "one hour in a passport queue"
As a gold elite plus holder I can use the Madrid lounges. The trip was uneventful until I got to Madrid airport having to wait one hour in a passport queue. Then attempting to enter the puerta del sol lounge where the receptionist seemed to have taken on the role of an autocratic authoritarian prison guard. The police checking passports are far more pleasant and civil they are decent people. Where AENA recruits it staff from I have no idea but they must treat them really badly if they are this nasty.

### "Usual poor service"
Usual poor service. Only booked with Air Europa to use up my air miles. They cancelled my seat reservations made at time of booking. They never explained but I guess because by the time of flight my status has changed from elite plus to elite. Always good to see their ability at annoying their regular customers is at its finest once again. I would recommend they do not serve food as it is revolting and just adds to the perception of them taking their customers for mugs.

### "recommend avoiding this airline"
I would strongly recommend avoiding this airline. I flew London to Tunisia and back. On the way there the staff were abrupt and fairly rude to passengers, the arm rest was broken with wires from the media controls sticking out of it. Same  staff attitude on the return, and this time the seat was stuck in an uncomfortable position and the armrest wouldn’t lift (making it awkward to get in and out of the seat. The plane was so loud I thought it was damaged But, all of that I can ultimately let slide because it was cheap and it got me where I wanted to go. But the worst part if my luggage was damaged in transit - the handles were broken and now only served as ornaments and the built in lock was ripped off. I reported this at the airport, filled in the relevant stuff and provided images before leaving the baggage claim. About 3 weeks later they wanted more images and details of the damage I claimed as well as an invoice for my purchase of the suitcase. After replying, another few weeks passed and they then wanted an image of the baggage tag, proof of the ticket, again wanting the invoice of purchase of the bag, as well as a ‘certificate’ from a luggage store/company confirming the value of my suitcase and confirming that it can’t be repaired. Its now September and I’ve not heard more from them

### "this airline should be your last resort"
Not Verified | This sadly wasn't the first time I've flown Air Europa, and necessity means I'll have to do at least one more flight but hopefully that will be it. It's difficult to begin where to start, and to be frank there are so many failings that listing them would be a rather long process so I'll keep it brief. My last flight was long haul (Gatwick to Córdoba, Argentina via Madrid) and in Business Class. This is supposedly a low cost carrier and the standard in all respects but one is indeed low cost; comfort, food, cabin crew etc. The one thing which wasn't low cost was the price, it was more expensive than similar airlines such as Air France and KLM the other carriers I've previously used and been happy with. I suppose other than the truly uncomfortable seats the worst aspect was the cabin crew. I've rarely seen such self-serving people in the service industry. On this latest flight there was literally one person who seemed to enjoy her job, a young lady who was helpful and with a smile. The male attendants ranged from being uninterested to almost overtly aggressive. Others have pointed out the practical failings and lack of comfort of the actual planes so I'll leave that but in all honesty this airline should be your last resort. I had hopes that the proposed takeover by IAG would turn it around but that seems to have come to an end with the business pulling out of the deal.

### "service has been gradually deteriorating"
Early morning flight with chaotic boarding process. Rude ground staff with really poor attitude. Excellent new aircraft with comfortable business cabin. Unprofessional cabin crew with zero interest in providing a decent service. Mediocre business class breakfast served as you didn't deserve it. Any interaction with the cabin crew seemed to bother them. Cabin crew acted like they were more interested in criticizing each other than taking care of their customers. I've been observing how their service has been gradually deteriorating in the last months. Flight was at least on time. After six years at the highest level of their frequent flyer program, I'm seriously considering flying other airlines.

### "deterioration Air Europa continues"
The deterioration in service standards with Air Europa continues. The flight was 2.5 hours late. I cannot tell you why, as neither the flight nor cabin crew felt it necessary to explain or apologise for the delay. But as always in summer in Spain the weather was perfect all day. Air Europa is an airline that relies on connections to its hub in Madrid to other destinations and so some passengers on board this flight would have inevitability missed their connection. Given this the crew’s silence is all the more extraordinary. But more importantly it led to an increase in frustration in passengers and a scuffle broke out as desperate passengers scrambled to disembark to get their connecting flight. The crew showed no capacity for professionalism or attempting to diffuse the understandable frustration that accrued by 1) the delay, and 2) failure by the crew to apologise or mention it. This is not the first time that I have observed flight or cabin crew failing to control threats to passenger safety and I now simply question whether this airline is safe to fly with at all. It is certainly not worthy of clients given the contempt it shows them.

### "told us to check our cabin bags"
The worst airline with the worst staff at the Terminal 1 of Madrid. I don’t recall to be more embarrassed by someone in my life, but when I was trying to board the second plane on my way to London in Madrid. My friend and me were traveling from Punta Cana already and had a stop in Madrid before heading back home in London. We were absolutely tired and we were the last people to board the plane even though we arrived there with 3 hours in advance. When it was our turn, a member of the ground staff told us to check our cabin bags because the flight was full and there was no space. We told him we rather not do it as we were tired and my friend was sick we wouldn’t be able to spend more time waiting for the bags. This worker shouted at us straight away and said that this is mandatory, which I replied to not to shout at me, then he was shouting around saying that he will ban me from Air Europa. He then asked if my friend speaks Spanish which we said no, then he started to insult her in Spanish and telling us off. I made big complaints about this situation and nothing has been solved. I would rather not to travel anymore than flying with Air Europa.

### "App experience is directly embarrassing"
Not Verified |   My trip from Lisbon to Las Palmas through Madrid was made hellishly difficult by the complete incompetence of every employee that I had the misfortune of running in to - air staff excluded. I had to call their "customer support" because they insisted i paid extra for my luggage for each leg of the return journey. It took 9 days With numerous daily attempts to get through. The App experience is directly embarrassing. It is slower than a painful death and crashes constantly. It also randomly changes your user language making it de facto useless, and to top off that, they insisted that I checked My hand luggage and then sent it to the wrong destination. Their ground support in Madrid airport should be fired without warning! How on earth a modern company can get the truly idiotic idea to hire airport staff who doesn't speak English is beyond me. I highly recommend everybody to stay clear of Air Europa. The one up side i will concede was that they at least managed to get us to the ground safely and on time.

### "not recommend this airline"
Not Verified |   I had a bad experience with my carry on going up and down ramps and airplane steps. I was exhausted just moving around with my carry on, and on my return i was force to check in my carry as not to go through it all again. I had to pay $165.00 which was ridiculously high. My return was worse after plane landed again those outdoor steps and bus then had to walk about 45 minutes to my connecting flight i was so exhausted. This airline is for young people, no way of knowing ahead of time. I would not recommend this airline.

### “Planes were not very clean”
Had to check my carry on luggage because supposedly the overhead cabin was full. After having to leave my luggage outside of the plane to put it in the cargo, I can see that there's dozen of space left in the overhead bin. Ground staff was also not very friendly. The bus which took us to the plane also brought us to the wrong plane first, after people disembarked from the bus they were sent back to get to the right plane. Planes were also not very clean.

### “there was absolutely no friendliness”
Stunning bad overall performance of crew. My wife and I flew on the 2nd of April 2024 from Brussels to Miami by Air Europa. The flight from Brussels to Madrid went well, but the flight from Madrid to Miami was a very bad experience due to bad performance of the crew including the cockpit crew. We flew on Air Europa’s Boeing 787-9 tail number EC-ODH, flight number UX097. We were seating in the first row of economy class seats 15H and 15J. What occurred to us was no welcome from the captain at the departure but also at arrival on Miami. What really worried me as a private pilot with more than 30 years’ experience is the fact that the safety procedures at departure were not followed: there was no cross check of the doors by the cabin crew upon departure. What also occurred to me was that there were no instructions over the intercom from the cockpit to the cabin crew. Secondly, it is odd that you have to pay for earphones on a transatlantic flight. I never experienced that in my (many) other flights. Thirdly, there was absolutely no friendliness of, or eye contact with the cabin crew. Holding a doctorate in service quality, I am keen to the hospitality attitude of the cabin crew. After a first meal that was OK (we ordered special meals), but thrown on your table we were actually forgotten in the second serving. No drinks, no snack because they were working from the back to the front, which is also, let’s say a different way of serving. When my wife went to the pantry, an older stewardess (purser?) denied that our row (three seats) was not served and did not want to provide us with what they called (extra) drinks. Actually, they suggested that my wife lied. Finally, they gave in and gave us an almost empty bottle of cola. Then, five minutes before landing, they threw us two food bags. We didn’t open it until the customs asked us and it turned out that it was the forgotten snack with an apple. We were picked out of the line because of the apple and had to wait half an hour before we could get our suitcases. This was the first but also the last time we flew with Air Europa. As a member of Skyteam you expect a better performance. So, no Air Europe for us anymore!

### “managed to fall short in every aspect”
Not Verified | I recently had the misfortune of flying with Air Europa, and I must say, it was an experience I would not recommend to anyone. As a frequent traveler, I have certain expectations when it comes to airlines, but Air Europa managed to fall short in every aspect. The pre-flight experience was a nightmare. The app was unintuitive and offered little to no assistance. Customer service was virtually nonexistent, and the selection of non-stop flights was extremely limited. Upon arriving at the Madrid airport three hours early, hoping to have a relaxing breakfast in the lounge after checking our bags, we were met with a frustrating surprise. The check-in agents didn't arrive until 1.5 hours before the flight, forcing us to wait in an excruciatingly long line just to check our luggage. To make matters worse, the gate wasn't announced until a mere 10 minutes before boarding. Once on board, the discomfort continued. The seats were cramped and offered minimal legroom. The staff managed to serve dinner quickly, but their efficiency didn't extend to other aspects of the flight. The in-flight entertainment was a complete letdown. In an era where most airlines offer a simple portal for passengers to watch movies on their laptops, Air Europa had no such option. Even after paying a hefty fee for subpar Wi-Fi, passengers were limited watching movies on the TV set - which is tough considering they ran out of headphones so now I have no way of watching anything (hence why I have the time to submit this review) In summary, my experience with Air Europa was utterly disappointing. From the lackluster pre-flight experience to the uncomfortable seating and inadequate in-flight amenities, this airline failed to meet even the most basic standards. I strongly advise fellow travelers to avoid Air Europa and opt for airlines that prioritize customer satisfaction and provide a more pleasant flying experience. Rating: 0/10.

### "zero customer service"
Flight from Miami - Madrid delayed over 6 hours. Missed connection to Barcelona, and then missed connection on to Mallorca. Had to buy new flight to Mallorca. Wouldn't put us on same day flight Barcelona, and refused to release luggage to me to buy a different flight or take the train. Absolutely zero customer service. Zero communication. Other flight to Barcelona was late (of course). Bags take hours to receive off their planes. S WI-FI didn't work halfway through on overseas flight. Seats extremely cramped. Food was lukewarm and mediocre, and served almost immediately after takeoff.

### "staff didn’t listen to anything"
I bought two return tickets from JFK to Madrid and from Madrid to JFK. On our return flight, we got the boarding passes, I wasn’t feeling well and went to use the restroom. I haven’t heard any announcements. When we reached the gate they said we couldn’t get to the plane. The plane was at the gate but the staff didn’t hear anything. I saw a flight attendant coming out of the plane, I told three ladies that this flight attendant just came out so please let us go in. I have to pay for an extra night at the hotel. And there are two new return tickets. It is a huge expense. I have been trying to explain to them, but the staff didn’t listen to anything.

### "encountered terrible service"
Having missed my connection due to Air Europa incompetence and a five hour wait for the next flight, I encountered terrible service on their business class flight. Cramped seat, dreadful food (they only seem to know how to cook one dish as it is always Ravioli). The lounge at Madrid airport is also dreadful with no dining available in the evenings.

### "disappointed with service"
First impression upon boarding was good. Quite clean, and staff kept the toilets clean throughout the 11hr flight. Flight was on time and arrived ahead of schedule which was a bonus. I was disappointed with service. They served food within 2 hours of boarding the plane. I'm not stranger to flying longhaul flights so I was quite surprise with what they served for how much we paid for. Our lunch consist of rice and chicken, steamed carrot; small bread and butter and pudding. Head phones you have to pay for. Any other snack you need to pay for too. Research about the airline before booking.. I would try to avoid this airline.

### "couldn’t even give me a free water"
Not Verified | My mother passed away so I didn’t have much of a choice of tickets as I needed to get out to Spain quick so as a frequent flyer I decided to try air Europa. NEVER AGAIN! From the minute we boarded and were left in the aisle to board for over 40 mins and everyone was hot and tired to getting a piece of chicken with a bread roll and a tiny dessert. No water throughout the 12 hour flight. The crew were too busy talking to care that I needed water to take headache tablets. The seats were sooooo cramped that I had the person behind me knees in my back. Then they left my baggage on the side in error and I spent an hour looking for it. I will Never fly Air Europa again!! Over $1200 a ticket and they couldn’t even give me a free water

### "a definite low-cost feel"
My recent flight from Porto to Madrid with Air Europa was a no-frills affair. The plane itself was decent, but the overall service had a definite low-cost feel. On the positive side, the flight departed exactly on schedule. However, the boarding process was a bit chaotic. Many passengers seemed to have more carry-on luggage than allowed, which caused frustration. The crew were friendly enough, but their English wasn't the strongest, making communication a bit challenging. Overall, if you're looking for a cheap and efficient way to get from Porto to Madrid, Air Europa might be a decent option. However, don't expect any frills or exceptional service. I would probably fly with them again, but only if the price was significantly cheaper than other airlines.

### "travel experience a pleasant one"
Not Verified | I wish to thank the Crew of my flight. As a frequent flyer - I understand very well the stresses of every journey. I can only say how grateful I am to each and every crew member of this Air line that makes my travel experience a pleasant one. I understand implicitly how difficult the process and thought of planning a trip, whatever the reason... But I see it's easier to complain than to express gratitude when appreciation is due. After the past few years, we have encountered the most difficult times we've never thought we would faced, we've forgotten the saddest times, and most of all, not being able to visit our relatives abroad. We are adjusting to changes, we are able at last to fly across the world to give us back the sense of belonging; I hope my message or feedback" reaches everyone that I had the pleasure to meet during my flights, and be known that I always be thankful.

### "they will not pay anything"
On December 12th, we departed from Madrid-Barajas with over two hours of delay, resulting in our arrival in Miami with the same delay. The Air Europa team arrived late for boarding, causing us to lose our place in the take-off queue and requiring us to join the line again. Many of us missed our connecting flight in Miami, despite having more than 3 hours for the connection, which I have made dozens of times before. As it was the last flight of the day, there were no available flights until the following morning. Air Europa claims to provide support, but they offer neither food vouchers, nor hotel accommodation. Over the phone, I was informed that I was entitled to all of these benefits and reimbursement for the new ticket I had to purchase the next day. I spent the night in the airport, in the middle of winter and feeling quite cold. No one provided a voucher or hotel service. When I submitted the claim for expenses and the new ticket, it took them two and a half months to respond!! This was only because I kept calling continuously; I am certain that had I not been persistent, they would never have responded, hoping it would be forgotten. Their response, two and a half months later, is that they are sorry, they regret the bad experience, but they will not pay anything. They deny your claim because they know that at some point, you will become frustrated with battling against a brick wall and stop pursuing it. Do not use Air Europa; now you know what to expect.

### “poor punctuality”
Hopeless. This flight departed two hours late meaning myself and dozens of passengers missed their connections. Don't for one moment think this is unusual. This particular flight is delayed by than 40 minutes 40% of the time. Air Europa attempts to enter markets that requires connections at its Madrid hub. Their poor punctuality means you have a 30% chance of a night stay in Madrid. In flight service is a joke. See the picture of their business class dining.

### “unpleasant boarding gate staff”
As a platinum card holder, various benefits are promised by Air Europa including unlimited upgrades to business class if space, priority check in etc, On this trip however, there was no priority check in (airline said airport was busy), and attempting to get upgraded involves long arguments with unpleasant boarding gate staff who say you must request at the check in desk, and check in staff who say you can only do this at the gate. These are repeated experiences. Responses by the airline when contacted are usually masterpieces in obsfucation and there is always an excuse for every service failure.

### "Horrible experience"
Not Verified |  Horrible experience. I had paid for 3 seats in row 15 (emergency exit) and the day before they were canceled as I was traveling with my 11 year old daughter but no alternative was given to me given the short notice even when I presented a medical certificate for serious leg problems. Very dirty planes (filthy bathroom without soap on Madrid Sai Paulo already departing), only dinner on an 11 hour flight and of terrible quality and quantity. No pillow, blanket or earphones for a fee. Plane from Milan heavily delayed and at risk of losing connection to Madrid. Plane parked 20 minutes away from the terminal, no warning, no Air Europa staff to help or reassure. Flight entertainment didn't work but the on-board staff said there was nothing they could do. A cheap airline for the price of a traditional one. Packed plane and very narrow seats for tall people like me. Absolutely avoid! Esperienza orribile. Avevo pagato per 3 posti in fila 15 (uscita emergenza) ed il giorno prima sono stati cancellati in quanto viaggiavo con figlia di 11 anni ma nessuna alternativa mi è stata data visto lo scarso preavviso anche quando ho presentato certificato medico per seri problemi gamba. Aerei sporchissimi (bagno lurido e senza sapone su Madrid Sai Paulo già in partenza), sola cena su volo 11 ore e di pessima qualità e quantità. Niente cuscino, coperta ed auricolari a pagamento. Aereo da Milano in forte ritardo e a rischi perdita connessione a Madrid. Aereo parcheggiato a 20 minuti di distanza dal terminale, nessun avviso, nessun personale Air Europa ad aiutare o tranquillizzare. Flight entertainment non funzionava ma il personale di bordo ha detto che non c’era nulla da fare Una cheap airline al prezzo di una tradizionale. Aereo stracolmo e sedili strettissimi per persone alte come me. Da evitare assolutamente!

### "experience with them was a nightmare"
This is a terrible airline. Seats are tiny, staff are extremely rude, food is inedible & small, toilets disgusting. My experience with them on both sectors was a nightmare. Unfortunately I had already booked another flight with them for end of January but after that I will never fly with them again. Just horrible

### "an excellent airline"
I found Air Europa to be an excellent airline. Check in was smooth and friendly, service on both legs was friendly and professional. The flight was very comfortable with a good selection of films and entertainment. The food was delicious and quite sufficient. My luggage was waiting for me when I got through customs. I am flying back on Friday 24th and look forward to the experience

### “Service barely polite, no more”
Very disappointing quality of food in Business Class, no difference really to Economy. Service barely polite, no more. 10 hour flight without ever someone offering you something to drink. Sleeping topper totally insufficient (too thin), bad quality of seat. Huge problem when I had to rebook the return flight two days earlier: international call center went dead, local center in ASU refused to rebook without penalty, but airline only offered Business Standard at the time of booking (! ), not the FLEX fare, and now, it wanted over $ 500 to simply rebook two days earlier into a half empty flight. What a scam. Very disappointed, also at hearing one of their reps say: "That you a SUMA Platinum member is of no interest to us. I will fly LATAM and LH again in the future.

### “business class was substandard”
I booked my business class trip online. We were taking 3 pieces of luggage. I entered this as such not realizing they were asking for "Extra checked bags. I was charged $220. I immediately called the airline (within 30 minutes of booking) to tell of my mistake in the hopes of getting the $220 refunded. They said they do not refund anything. I thought there was a 24 hour grace period with free cancellations but they said this does not apply to them. We just returned from our trip. The business class was substandard. The seats were really hard. When reclined, it felt like sleeping on an ironing board. They purchased the least expensive, most uncomfortable seats when they ordered the plane. Further, when you board, a flight attendant immediately assists you in putting on a slightly padded seat cover onto your seat. I'm guessing this is because of complaints about the seats in the past. Anyway, the seat cover does not help. So uncomfortable. Never had this in any other overnight business class that I've flown.

### "worst airline I've ever flown"
Not Verified |  If you have any problems with your luggage or items left on board, this airline is the absolute worst. I have done every thing that they have told me to do in order to get my lost cell phone back however, when I called to find out if anything has been found or if anybody has simply reviewed my email, I get hung up on forget a nasty attitude from a representative. I have asked to speak to a supervisor and every single time they tell me that there are no supervisors working. This is ridiculous and this airlines customer service is the worst that I have ever dealt with. In addition from Madrid to Miami, which is a nine hour flight, the Wi-Fi never worked. This is the worst airline I've ever flown.

### "Deeply frustrating customer service"
I flew with this company in mid-January 2023. Since then I'm trying to get compensation for my suitcase which has been damaged during the flight. From January 2023, they just ping-ponged emails and no ultimate action. In the end, they asked me to provide a receipt for the new suitcase purchase. However, it has no correlation with the fact that they broke my item as well as my budget and purchase plan is not their business. So first of all, they kept me up in the air, and since May, I just started to ignore me. This company is not willing to meet commitments and responsibilities. Deeply frustrating customer service.

### "Worst ever, please avoid it"
Worst ever, please avoid it. Your trip, vacation, business meetings will be ruined. 12h trip had turned into 72h trip, how's that? No one can help you, no straight answer, no strait solution about refund. You can't cancel, you can't fly. So many people near their desk, that next time someone should invite a DJ, and turned into a party. Anyway, pay 100$ extra with better airlines and have it.

### "I wouldn’t recommend"
Not Verified |  Our original flight was directly from JFK to Madrid, but when we arrived to check in our bag we were told there are more available seats on the plane. We were told the original aircraft was replaced with a smaller aircraft last second. We were not thrilled about this but were willing to be accommodated as long as we made it to Madrid. We were switched to a connecting flight from New York to Portugal to Madrid. We accepted and eventually made it Madrid, one of my our checked bags made it but somehow not the second one. When we went to the help desk Air Europa had zero information on our missing luggage but told us it will eventually arrive. We created a report and left the airport hoping to enjoy our vacation as much as possible but that just hasn’t been the case. Basically spending vacation time each day buying essentials and clothes that were already packed for the trip in the missing luggage. We’ve called multiple times and kept being told they are searching for the luggage, there seems to be no sense of urgency in the search. Currently on day 3 of my 9 day on the trip and this situation has definitely made it difficult to fully enjoy the trip. I wouldn’t recommend flying with this airline unless maybe you only have carryon bags.

### "service of a discount airline"
Not Verified |  Terrible onboarding and off boarding. Only airline that gets you with a bus to the terminal. Priced like a normal airline, but service of a discount airline.

### "Worst airline across the Atlantic"
Flight crew quite unfriendly and seemed to be bothered by the passengers. Only one meal complimentary, the rest you must pay for. Worst airline across the Atlantic and I don't recommend anyone fly them.

### "Terrible customer service"
Not Verified |  Terrible customer service, terrible website, terrible check-in process, nothing works. Will never be flying Air Europa ever again, even if I have to pay double on a different airline

### "no frills or service onboard"
This was a fairly low passenger flight, so I managed to score an entire row to myself in the back of the plane. We were late to take off, but made up sometime and arrived just a few minutes late. Again, no frills or service onboard this flight. Cabin crew spoke English and the landing was extremely rough – one of the worst landings based on recent memories. The upside is that I only paid 25 USD for the trip.

### "extremely mediocre"
I have flown Air Europa several times over the years due to their membership in the SkyTeam alliance. I’m glad the alliance has a Spanish member as I enjoy trips to Spain, but I wouldn’t make Air Europa my first choice. I’d describe this airline as reliable, but extremely mediocre. Everything from onboard amenities to service are just either underwhelming or mediocre since they nickel and dime you for everything despite the full carrier prices that’s charged. Glass of water, 3 euros. Food, 5 to 10 euros. Seat allocation, 15 euros. I understand that the business model has changed since the advent of budget carriers, but I wish there was a methodical system the carrier could introduce based on the price of the ticket paid for better service as I know my ticket wasn’t cheap. I got there on time and ended up sleeping through most of the flight as there was nothing really to look forward to.

### "good legroom, tasty meals"
Experienced pilots and TCPs, good legroom, tasty meals, relatively low costs for its price and comfortable seats. This airline has it all. If you are going to book a flight, first check that it is in Air Europa, because I recommend flying with them more than once in a lifetime.

### "Avoid this company like the plague"
I booked return flights for a friend and myself with these people. It wasn’t until after my booking was completed and paid for that the confirmation email informed me that my flights would not be with them, but would be with Canary Fly. I checked the Canary Fly website and costed up the flights with them - Air Europa had charged me double the flight cost I would have paid if I had booked direct with Canary Fly! If I was told in advance of completing the purchase the flight would be with another airline, I would obviously have check them for flight prices first! In addition, my Canarian Residents discount wasn’t applied to my tickets, and when I called to bring it to their attention, I was basically told “tough, we can’t do it now”. So as well as paying 100% more through them, I also paid 75% more than I should have with residents discount. Avoid this company like the plague.

### "The most incompetent airline"
Not Verified |  The most incompetent airline you could fly with. They lost my luggage in the hold and two stopover flights when I returned to my country were delayed to the point that I lost the third. My vacation thanks to them was a nightmare, because I lost a lot of things thanks to their ineptitude, in addition to buying clothes, hygiene items, among other things. I lost count of the times I called to find out about the whereabouts of my suitcase. I even had to wait more than three months for them to pay me what was lost. The icing on the cake was that what they gave me covers only half of the total value of what my suitcase had. I advise you that although their prices are tempting, do not travel with this airline. La aerolínea más incompetente con la que podrías viajar. Perdieron mi equipaje en bodega y dos vuelos de escala al retornar a mi país se atrasaron al punto de que yo perdiera el tercero. Mis vacaciones gracias a ellos fue una pesadilla, por que perdí un montón de cosas gracias a su ineptitud, además de comprar ropa, enceres de higiene entre otras cosas. Perdí la cuenta de las veces que llamé para saber sobre el paradero de mi maleta. Incluso tuve que esperar más de tres meses para que me remuneren lo que se perdió. La guinda del pastel fué que lo que me dieron cubre sólo la mitad del valor total de lo que mi maleta llevaba. Les aconcejo qué aunque sus precios sean tentadores no viajen con ésta aerolínea.

### "Very bad organization"
What a hectic flight - late already and while starting to roll the pilot says that we have a engine problem and must return to the stand 30 minutes in the plane stranded and we told to leave because of tests to the plane 45 minutes in the gate and they change the gate and don’t say a thing and boarding as fast as we could and no control. No food, no nothing, just board and up we go. Very bad organization.

### "a good flight experience"
Flight in time, plane arrived sooner then expected, boarding was fast, flight attendants even as it was a not full flight told people before take off that could use vacant rows. Was a good flight experience.

### "it was good but not great"
Very busy flight, but arrived according to schedule. Food and drinks available to buy. Seat was ok. Infotainment system worked but no ear-phones were provided so it was like silent films. All in all it was good but not great.

### "Avoid this airline"
Avoid this airline. Do not fly with Air Europa if you have a connecting flight. They give you one hour to board the next flight but in reality, once you get off your first flight, you only have 35 minutes remaining. Then you have to run as fast as you could to the next terminal and pass through passport control which has massive queue. My husband who is EU national (he used the privileged gate for EU national), arrived quicker at the boarding gate and asked the 3 staffs in the gate to wait for me, (if ever I will be running late) due to the long queue in the passport control. They all refused as if it was our choice to come from the other end of the airport. Good thing we are young, with minimal luggages so we were able to arrive on time but I was really exhausted from running. If you're old, or have a family, children or not used to running, consider your plane ticket obsolete. The staff at the gate have zero empathy and they seem to have no idea that some of their passengers are coming from an Air Europa connecting flight because they just don't care about you at all. If they cannot accommodate their own passengers coming from a connecting flight, why would they sell this flight in the first place? Some of you might say that I could've joined my husband in the EU national passport control queue to arrive faster, my husband asked the staff in Madrid airport if I can join him, they refused and said that if he wants to join me, he should queue at the "all passport

### "no compensation provided"
They are simply awful. Flight took off late by 30 minutes from MAD due to which it arrived little late at MUC, because of this I along with 7 other passengers missed our connection to AUH, Etihad airways did not wanted to help as the problem was caused due to in bound late arrival and when we had to go to Air Europa counter(in a different terminal) they said the flight was only delayed by 10 minutes, hence they are not responsible. No rebooking done, no compensation provided and we were left stranded at MUC airport.

### "little positive to be said"
I am a person who travels frequently and with many airlines but the experience I had yesterday with air europe was quite unpleasant, first the customer service is terrible, you could see in his face that he was annoyed when I made an order for something, The presentation of the food and the terrible quality, it seemed to me that I was in a prison because they put the bread on top of the food, the tray only contained a bread, pasta or chicken and a sweet that did not taste anything, I ordered a coke and they gave me half a glass, then I thought that they were not going to give a snack on a 9-hour flight, they did, but you had to pay for it, which I have never seen on long trips. I flew economy class but paid a price with a bag of almost $2000. The way from Miami to Madrid was the same, first the flight left 2 1/2 late, not even an apology, they only gave a text message, the food was terrible and breakfast had to be paid for, the end is very little positive to be said about that airline. Yo soy una persona que viajo frecuente y con muchas aereolines pero la experiencia que tuve ayer con air europe fue bastante desagradable,primero la atencion al cliente es pesima ,se le podia ver en su rostro que le molestaba cuando le hacia el pedido de algo, la presentacion de la comida y la calidad terrible ,me parecia que estaba en una prision pues el pan lo ponian arriba de la comida ,la bandeja solo contenia un pan la pasta o el pollo y un dulce que no sabia nada ,pedi una coca cola y me dieron medio vaso ,despues pense que no iban a dar un snack en un vuelo de 9 horas ,si lo dieron pero habia que pagarlo cosa que nunca he visto en viajes largos. y es verdad vole en clase turista pero pague un precio con maleta de casi $2000. La ida de miami a madrid fue igual primero el vuelo salio 2 1/2 tarde ni una disculpa dieron solamente un mensaje de texto ,la comida pesima y el desayuno habia que pagarlo ,el fin es muy poco lo positivo que hay que decir de esa aereolinea

### "This airline isn’t competitive"
My wife and I flew Business Class and this is our experience. We couldn’t check in online because Air Europa required a negative Covid test be provided. That requirement was dropped on flights to the USA over a year ago. Consequently, we were unable to check in online. At the airport we needed a wheelchair. We sat in an uncomfortable “holding area” for over an hour and didn’t reach the gate until fifteen minutes before boarding. Consequently, we didn’t have lounge access prior to our flight. Those who needed to pre-board (my wife) or with Priority Status (myself) were left standing in a hot jetway for fifteen minutes before boarding the aircraft because the in flight staff weren’t ready for us. We could have remained comfortably seated at the gate until the aircraft was ready. The Business Class menu offered “Selection of Appetizers of either Gazpacho or Light Potato Cream and Parsley Oil”. Neither was offered. The menu offered “Starters” but they were served on the same tray as the entrée, along with a choice of chips or nuts. For a six hour flight why was the meal service rushed? Why wasn’t it serve it as intended, in courses? The main course was pasta and it was inedible. The ravioli was over-baked in flight and crusty. A sauce added some moisture but it was tasteless. The menu offered a “Cheeseboard” but it wasn’t served. The dessert on the menu was “Granny style chocolate cake”. It wasn’t cake at all. It was more like cheesecake or mousse which was overly sweet and tasteless. Air Europa provided us two Wifi passes. I followed the instructions provided on my phone and laptop but it only worked for messaging. When I called this to the attention of the flight attendant she tried to assist me but then she took my computer away from me and stowed it in the compartment of my seat, as if to dismiss me. Had I paid $30.00 for the plan I’d have been more than a bit upset. Why provide this perk if it upsets your customers because it doesn’t work? Speaking of flight attendants, one hadn’t been through the cabin over an an hour since our dinner trays were cleared. They seemed to hide in the galley, hoping the passengers would go to sleep so they didn’t have to deal with us. The good news is that we landed safely at JFK, but we were left sitting in the cabin for thirty more minutes because we had to be transported to the terminal by bus. A finishing touch to a terrible experience. This airline isn’t competitive with the services of other carriers, including many discount airlines. I understand Air Europa has been sold to Iberia Airlines for €500 million. This a fraction of the value of your aircraft. It’s as though the airline has given up and said “forget it”. We’ll go through the motions of operating it until we’ve be taken over by someone actually capable of doing so. For the benefit of your customers, the sooner that occurs the better.

### "Don't be scammed into booking with them"
Not Verified |  Air Europa is probably the worst airline in Europe. Do not use them. My elderly mother booked a business class return flight for a wedding in Madrid in May 2023. She was emailed a week before the flight to say that there were strikes over the dates of the flights she had booked. She called customer Air Europa services to get some more information, however they couldn't confirm whether or not the strike would affect her flights. Not wanting to risk missing the wedding, she booked other flights with a separate airline. When she tried to cancel the flights with Air Europa, she was told the strikes no longer impacted her flight and she could not cancel. The customer service representative also talked over her for the entire conversation. Pathetic, thoughtless and obstructive service. I have experienced better communication from small national carriers in Africa and the subcontinent. Don't be scammed into booking with them.

### "our flight is closed for check in"
Worst customer service. Will never use again. Not willing to be there for their customers. I was on time but in a long line with a lot of people, by the time we got to the ticket counter we were told our flight is closed for check in. They send us to their customer service across from the ticket counter, which had another huge line. At customer service we were told sorry, you will have to pay additional $260 to re book next flight 4 hours later, and saying we should of came 2-3 hours before the flight. I asked how come you are charging us since we paid for that ticket. They said if i came 10 min ago they would. We paid and re booked. Even their customer service said same on the phone as in person, we are late and should come earlier.

### Air Europa customer review
Not Verified |  The worst airline on planet earth. That changed the gates over 5 times from one side of the terminal to other, flight was delayed numerous times. Customer service non existent, in fact very rude. Business class was a ripoff. The worst experience by far. Never again.

### "this is the worst airline"
I would begin with advising people not to use this airline. I was recently booked to travel from Zurich to Santa Cruz in Bolivia, via Madrid. The flight to Madrid was constantly being delayed, eventually six hours past the original scheduled departure the flight was cancelled. At this point it was past midnight and passengers were told to collect bags and find a hotel in Zurich. We were informed that this hotel cost would be reimbursed by the airline, Air Europa. I finally arrived at a hotel at past 1am. Subsequent attempts to obtain reimbursement of the hotel costs have been refused by Air Europa, as they state it is not their responsibility! Similarly, denied any responsibility to provide compensation, we were provided with one CHF5 meal voucher during the 6 hour delay. In addition, the airline were to advise passengers of rescheduled flights. I called the customer services at around 6am, but they initially denied responsibility for rescheduling flights and then I called again at 9am to be informed I was scheduled for 12 mid-day flight. I received no notification of this either by text, email, WhatsApp or direct call. AirEuropa has also denied responsibility for any form of compensation. I started my journey Sunday morning and finally arrived on Tuesday morning, after spending 12 hours sat in Madrid airport waiting for the rescheduled connecting flight. On the return journey from Bolivia to Switzerland I went to check-in online but could not find my reservation. I had to call Switzerland, only to find that Air Europa had cancelled my return flight " as I did not take the original flight"! Obviously I did not take the original flight as they had cancelled it, and rescheduled for the following day. I travel extensively for work and can quite honestly say this is the worst airline I have ever had to deal with.

### "Boarding was ridiculously ineffective"
Airline pretended Not to know about the airport strike on Feb 17th. But you have to take the flight from Munich to Madrid, otherwise you can not board in Madrid. We traveled on our own cost to Madrid to get the connection to Santo Domingo. Boarding was ridiculously ineffective and takes forever. On the way back differently but bad. Flight attendants were extremely unfriendly and rude to me on way back from Santo Domingo to Madrid on Feb 28th. Never again. Not even cheap!

### "crew were great on both legs"
Pleasantly surprised. There was a full bar service (to pay) on the domestic sector. The meal service on the long haul initially seemed poor was it was only one dish (2 choices) plus a bread roll, butter and small square of cake. However both the chicken and pasta was excellent quality and a generous portion. They was a pay bar service with sandwiches throughout the flight - no second free meal. The crew were great on both legs, interestingly more men than women but helpful, keen to please and professional.

### "worst airline ever"
The worst airline ever. Think twice before you book a flight with them. My round trip has been a nightmare. In my first flight to Peru my luggage was broken and 2 pairs of sneakers were stolen. I filed the claim in the airport and the person in charge corroborated the damage. but then when I called the airline they requested multiple thing such as a police statement, the statement of a luggage shop that can confirm that the luggage was broken and other details.

### "Worst flight ever"
Worst airline I have ever flown with. Worse than Ryanair or any other low-cost airline I have experienced, although Air Europa is a member of Skyteam and should provide a very good level of service. Appalling. Cabin staff are extremely disgraceful. They don’t provide free water or coffee on long-haul flight neither headsets to watch the very few films they provide. Seats are extremely narrow. The aircraft is almost new but badly taken care of, dirty. Worst flight ever. I would definitely give them a 0/10.

### "No water or anything to drink"
We were on the flight for 13 hours. Within the first 2 hours they had served an evening meal with a cold drink They then brought around coffee After that the lights went down and that was it. No water or anything to drink the rest of the flight.

### "it's even worse than Ryanair"
Worst company ever, worst customer service ever. Always late, don't give you any information, make you wait for hours for nothing. My flight got cancelled and I had to struggle for months to get the EU legal compensation, they do not answer your messages, their flight are always late/cancelled and good luck for the wait and get the compensation cause it will never come. A company to flee from. Never take this company, really it's even worse than Ryanair.

### "Disorganized and not cheap at all for economy"
One of the worst companies to fly with especially when doing transatlantic flights. In a 10 hour flight they provided 1 hot meal, ot even a snack, nothing. Also, they only offered 1 time drinks. The other two times they were doing the “service” everything needed to be purchased. Furthermore, they don’t even provide you with headphones that every airline does in these kinds of flights. You have to pay for the headphones additionally. The cabin crew was always in a rush. They don’t even told the other passengers to straighten their seat when we were eating, they only did it when we told them to. We did 2 times transatlantic flights with this company and we won’t again. Disorganized and not cheap at all for economy class and considering the service provided.

### Air Europa customer review
I flew with Air Europa from ZRH to EZE via MAD in Business Class. The experience was outstanding. Flights on time, excellent business class hardware product specifically the new and super comfortable business class seats on the Boeing 787-9, outstanding meals on the long haul flight from MAD to EZE (incl. best coffee ever served on a plane), very attentive and motivated cabin crews. All this at an amazing price of CHF 2,950 per PAX (and booking was rather short notice in December 2022). I usually only fly Swiss and Lufthansa on routes to South America but I have to say Air Europa is much better in Business Class and at the same time their pricing is by far better. Air Europe can definitely count me in going forward.

### "customer service is by far the worst"
Second time I flew with Air Europa, second time they lost my luggage. Getting in contact with the customer service is a pain in the a. Calling from Cuba on a regular phone costs 4 dollar per minute, The quality with VOIP is very limited and the English skills of their staff very limited. The online tracking of my luggage didn’t work before they opened their office. Then it was impossible to save the changes I had to make. Calling them seriously tests your patience. I waited on waiting lines for more than 2 hours.I asked the account several times to talk slow and louder because the connection was so bad. She hang up! This customer service is by far the worst I’ve ever experienced.

### "never fly again with this airline"
Not Verified |  First time flying with Air Europa from New York to Las Palmas. I was surprised early on that the sinks in the bathrooms were not working - at least 2 in the economy cabin. I understand for short haul flights but for such a long one to expect hand sanitizer is enough? Usually with red eye flights to Europe - at least what I've experienced is that they try and serve quickly as possible to maximize sleep time but the crew certainly took their sweet time. Had a 4 hour layover in Madrid - it's quite a long walk from T2 to T1 so glad we had plenty of time. 1 out of the 2 bags checked in didn't make it to my final destination. When you pay double the price due to inflation as well as for bags, you'd expect slightly better customer service but there is no information at all - whether it made it to Madrid in the first place or any information at all. Certainly does not care about the customer and will never fly again with this airline.

### "Worst customer service"
Not Verified |  Worst customer service ever. The staff at embarking point particularly a lady checking the boarding pass was super rude, she did not hide her anger against many customers. She accused us multiple times of breaking the line, while she was allowing people of later groups to skip in front of us, then when my husband asked why, she threatened him to not allow us to embark, it was very unprofessional.

### "truly the worst customer service"
Absolutely the worst airline ever. You can never fit your luggage, the staff are incredibly rude, oversold tickets, could not continue my journey to Frankfurt and got stuck in Madrid because of being oversold. Now of course I have no luggage because they took it and sent it to FRA, truly the worst customer service and airline I ever encountered, I am a pilot myself so I know!

### "Ground staff badly trained"
Not Verified |  LGW to COR return November 2022. Air Europa could be a smart, customer friendly budget airline but it isn't. Long haul flying with them is an endurance. Ground staff badly trained & disorganised with chaotic boarding procedures experienced at LGW, MAD and on the return from COR. It seems to be their speciality. PAs often garbled and made in Spanish only. There is no reasonable excuse for serving passengers only one meal on a 10 hour long haul flight. Expensive snacks sometimes available. I paid 5 euro for small bottle of water & pringles LGW to COR Unless you pay extra for reserving your seat during the online check in process, it is unlikely you will be able to sit in the part of the aeroplane that you would like. Air Europa markets itself as a budget friendly long haul alternative to the legacy national carriers. By the time you add all the additional costs for seat reservation, onboard catering etc it isn't It's only worth travelling with them if they offer a direct flight alternative not available with anyone else.

### "one of the worst business class products on the market"
Truly one of the worst business class products on the market (I'm a frequent flyer and usually fly about 12 a month). Unfriendly staff both in the air and on the ground, the most unappealing "food" imaginable, late flights virtually guaranteed. Do not recommend.

### "do not recommend at all"
Not Verified |  Let’s start with a 8 hr flight and only one meal. Drinks served are really shot glasses. It’s truly your Europe spirit airlines. From the point of contact at ticket agent not the most friendly but not rude on our way to Spain the crew was once again not friendly and seemed upset if we asked for anything so now it became rude. Well I just shook it off as they must be tired, I have been in travel industry for many yrs. I was wrong on the way from Spain to Miami ticket agent not friendly took passports and reservation no smile no how are you just group number we were a group of 4. She gave us our tickets and neglected to even tell us she did not put us all together and put us all in the middle seat spread out. Okay maybe it’s a full flight so I let The flight attendant know I was interested in changing my seat he said sure. But made no attempt to assist me when I went back to where my son was sitting I saw many seats available but once again I had all my stuff in my seat so I decided to stay in my seat. Later when I decided I needed some water I turned my light on to call for the flight attendant he then turned off my light several times without assisting me. So I gave this airline a try but with this experience I have to say poor service, do not recommend at all.

### "staff took no consideration"
Not Verified |  On my return flight from Madrid to Miami I experienced one of the worst services I have experienced with an airline. My wife is 9 weeks pregnant and on the return flight the staff was extremely rude and disrespectful. My wife was not feeling well once we entered the plane. I walked back to ask the flight attendant for some water and they rudely explained that they are not to give water in the beginning and if I new that my wife was not feeling well, I should have planned accordingly prior entering the plane. After I pleaded to please let me have some water, they provided some. The staff took no consideration what so ever. We had entered the flight early because we had priority boarding.

### "I was very pleasantly surprised"
I was a little concerned for my flights with Air Europa as most of the reviews are bad, so it's save for me to say that I was very pleasantly surprised. Apart from the almost 1h delay from Lisbon to Madrid (which did not interfere with the connection flight, since we had a few hours between flights) everything went as smoothly as could be. The 787 provide great flight conditions, the staff was polite and available. The company offers a complimentary meal for transatlantic flights and I have to say it was one of the best meals I had in a flight. Everything went perfect from LIS-MAD-JFK and back. I would definitely fly with Air Europa again and recommend.

### "didn’t refund me for nothing"
The worst airline. We got stuck in the airplane for 3 hours for “mechanical error”. And we reached Madrid 5 hours and a half later than schedule. This resulted in me missing my flight with KLM to Amsterdam even thought I had 4 and a half hour transit time. When I got to Madrid my flight was gone even though it was delayed another hour. When I went to Air Europa office they basically told me “tough luck”, and fill out a complaint form. I ended up spending money to book a flight (earliest was next morning), to book a hotel room to spend the night, and transportation back and forth. I also ended up missing a day from my Amsterdam trip, not to mention losing my hotel reservation there because of a “no show” status. It has been two weeks and they didn’t refund me for nothing. They didn’t even have the decency to respond to my complaint or say sorry!

### "lack of respect for its customers"
I flew twice with Air Europa. During the first, my suitcase took a big hit and was deformed, then during the second, the bottles neatly arranged inside were all broken. This company is incompetent when it comes to taking care of your luggage, this is a clear lack of respect for its customers. J'ai fait deux vols avec Air Europa. Pendant le premier, ma valise s'est pris un gros coup et a été déformée, puis pendant le second, les bouteilles soigneusement disposées à l'intérieur ont toutes été cassées. Cette compagnie est incompetente lorsqu'il s'agit de prendre soin de vos bagages, il s'agit d'un clair manque de respect envers ses clients.

### "no excuse for their behaviour"
This flight was bound to go wrong before it even took off. 2:30 AM flight leaving Alghero arriving in Madrid at 4:30. The inbound fight from Madrid had taken off at midnight so the crew were already exhausted. There was still no excuse for their behaviour. No welcoming or good byes to any passengers, no service and literally yelling at three older couples who had forgotten to put their mask on before entering the flight instead of politely informing them. The flight was the only one leaving Alghero at night. Forget the shops that were obviously closed, there was not even a possibility to buy water at the airport prior to the flight (vending machines empty.) This flight needs to be moved earlier or by all means later but the airport and cabin crew of Air Europa could not handle it on this occasion.

### "it has been a very satisfying experience"
3rd time on Air Europa and it has been a very satisfying experience. On time, clean and modern aircraft, friendly crew on the ground and on board. Never had an issue with them and I would be happy to fly them again.

### "Disorganized check in and chaotic boarding"
Chaotic / disorganized boarding. Older male member of Air Europa/Swissport was yelling at business class passengers: "if you want to fly you need step back and listen to me". Very rude and unprofessional. Some older passengers got shaken by his attitude. I have complained to local Air Europa female supervisor who did not supervise boarding. Instead she was hiding below the escalator with a male colleague. That is a clear job failure! They had no announcement about delayed boarding. They do not have boarding group lines organized and clearly marked. We had a similar experience in January in Madrid. Disorganized check in and chaotic boarding seems to be a chronic disease of Air Europa. It spoils passengers experience and the reputation of the airlines.

### "This was the worst experience"
Not Verified |  This was the worst experience I’ve ever had with an airline, first I checked in online from both flights going to Rome and coming back to nyc and both times their app said I was able to leave luggage at a drop off counter and proceed to security. In neither JFK or FCO does this airline have any luggage drop off counter, both times we waited 45 minutes just to check luggage. Secondly every flight, 4 in total, was delayed by an hour or more, and we were seated on the plane to wait during this time. The plane were extremely hot and uncomfortable, I witnessed and elderly couple ask for water and I watched as they were snubbed and spoken to rudely by the crew. On my 8 hour flight from nyc to Rome I reserved and paid for extra large seats a $220 cost, only to arrive on the plane and see that I had been moved to a middle seat in the middle of the plane. When I spoke to the crew they told me there was nothing they could do and I would have to ask for a refund upon arrival to our destination. I then saw the crew filling up the empty seats on the plane with standby flyers. I’m not opposed to this but wouldn’t it have made more sense to offer to move me and my husband? We paid for seats don’t get an apology or anything just brushed off by staff that seemed bothered I had even spoken to them at all. I feel like I was scammed, this airline should be formally investigated. Worst experience I’ve ever had I will never fly with them ever again and I hope no one else ever does either.

### "disgrace of an airline"
São Paulo to London Gatwick via Madrid. This is a joke/disgrace of an airline. We had booked with 2 adults and 2 children (ages 5 and 3). They placed us in separate seats. On check in they demanded that we pay extra for the privilege of having our toddlers sitting with us. With this ransom over our heads, we paid extra. On getting to the gate, despite us showing our online tickets, they demanded we go to a separate desk (with 30 minutes wait) to print the tickets. We got to the print desk, and they didn't have the updated seats we'd paid for at check in. Despite us having a 3 year old and having paid to be together the staff of this disgusting airline insisted we all sit apart. We spent the first ten minutes of being on the plane negotiating with various kind, unlucky customers seat swaps. During the 10 hour flight, we were offered one  meal and they also rationed water. There were several minor other gripes that place this airline way below its peers by itself but won't trivialise the above by going into details. Do yourself a favour and NEVER, NEVER use this disgrace of an airline. Employees there should feel ashamed.

### "very disappointed at their services"
I flew with Air Europa from Brussels to Bogota and from Lima to Brussels this summer and I was very disappointed at their services. The staff put me at the back of the airplane while knowing that I had a connecting flight in Madrid. The plane left Brussels with a 2 hour delay and I almost missed my connection. When I finally made it to Madrid, there were no indications and no help. The flight from Lima to Madrid was even more terrible. The plane was delayed for 5 hours and I missed my connection in Madrid. After a 12 hour flight and a 5 hour delay, I was obliged to wait for another 6 hours at Madrid Airport to catch the next flight to Brussels. When I asked for compensation, Air Europa refused to reimburse me. The company said that the delay was due to "unforeseen circumstances" and I thus don't qualify for a refund. Please save yourselves some time and energy. Air Europa is a company that doesn't respect its clients and their needs.

### "I will not fly with them anymore"
Not Verified |  Awful service. They didn’t give me any seat when I was doing the check in. I arrived to the airport 3 hours before the flight, I didn’t have any luggage and they told me to go to the main door and they will give me the seat. My surprise was when I arrived there and they told me to wait until the end for them to give me a seat. Very rude staff. I will not fly with them anymore and I will not recommend anyone doing that.

### "they don't give customer service at all"
My daughter and friend landed in Honduras after connection in Madrid. Their final destination - long trip in Guatemala. In Honduras the found out the friends suitcase didn't arrive. Since then, over a week, no one is assisting them in finding the suitcase which included medicine and many personal items. It ruins their trip. Don't fly with them, they don't give customer service at all.

### "Avoid at all cost"
Not Verified |  We booked and paid online. We arrive 2 hors before departure before being told we were on standby. Reason was a massive overbooking, the plane was delayed by 1.30 hours. We waited again to be told no one deemed overbooked will board. We has to retrieve our luggage to start again. The staff didn’t understand the sky team highest status saying there was no business class on the flight. Try to explain the difference between a priority status and a seat class to a wall was easier. Avoid at all cost.

### "totally unreliable and dishonest"
Not Verified |  In 2020 we booked a flight from Salvador, Brazil to Amsterdam, Netherlands. Covid stopped all travel. Air Europa cancelled our flight and rebooked and rebooked because Air Europa refused to refund. So we got stuck a voucher which worth nothing with these people. We finally decided to book a trip to Madrid because it is the only we can some of our money back. After nearly 2 hours talking to the "service desk" of Air Europa, we finally booked the flight for October but we had to pay a small amount extra. Ok, so we paid, however when we received the confirmation email, we also received confirmation that we still have a credit with AE. Very strange because we had to pay extra so how can we still have a credit. We called the so-called service centre again and they admitted that they made a mistake but when we asked for a refund for the extra money we paid, they refused because this was money for taxes or something like that and that they cannot refund. It is not the amount of money because it is only EUR 20 but it is the way they keep on stealing your money that makes me angry. So just a warning don't book any trip with Air Europa because they are basically totally unreliable and dishonest.

### "worst airline we have ever flown"
Not Verified |  This is the worst airline we have ever flown with. We flew London - Madrid - Havana return. The staff were rude. The food was awful and we were not offered a choice. You are allowed only 1 drink, the rest you have to pay for. Having flown overnight to Madrid we asked for a coffee and told the coffee was served 10 minutes ago, so it is no longer available (even though you have to pay for it). They lost our baggage.

### "I almost missed my flight"
I was flying within the European Union and the employees of this company at the check-in desk did not know that I did not need a covid test. I almost missed my flight.

### "sternly spoken to in the boarding process"
Not Verified |  After touring and meeting so many wonderful people in Spain and other countries, what a complete letdown for us to have returned home with this airline. From a ticket agent who did not understand their company policy on Covid to being very sternly spoken to in the boarding process after paying for priority boarding to being lectured about patience for needing water to upgraded seats. We paid for then twice, they tried to make us pay for them again then to learn they really are only bulkhead seats allowing you to be near the sights and smells of the toilet! Again, after such wonderful people and sights in Spain the attitude and treatment we felt will make certain we never allow our agent or cruise line to book us with them again.

### "They do not return my money"
Not Verified |  We were told that we had to book the suitcases and seats with the flight operator (Air Europa). So I went to their website to book the seats and suitcases. After a ridiculously high amount of money I booked and paid everything. Later it turned out that this reservation had not been made and that I did not book anything. Called several times, but all to no avail. The service is extremely hard to reach. You get put on hold and just hang there for an hour with no answer. Lost my money, i have no suitcases and no seats. They do not return my money nor give me me seats and luggage.

### "Very bad customer service"
Not Verified |  I have never been able to travel with Air Europa. I had purchased the Milan-Panama ticket in February 2020, the flight was scheduled for the dates 31 March-12 April 2020. Due to Covid19 the flight was obviously cancelled. I was first informed that the ticket was non-refundable, but I could get the voucher valid for one year. As I could not use the voucher for the year (as flights were continuously cancelled), I was informed that I could get a refund for the ticket. I have not received a reply by email since April 2021, not even by certified mail. When I call, I am told that I am still in a long queue, to send an e-mail, to which I obviously do not receive a reply. Very bad customer service.

### "flights arrived ahead of schedule"
Had 4 flights in total with Air Europa Munich -> Madrid -> Marrakech and back. All flights arrived ahead of schedule, carry on luggage rules were far better and some other airlines, one regular carry on 10KG plus a little bag it was the first time for me with this airline, before COVID I used to fly a lot for work and leisure with quite a couple of airlines and was positively surprised by this airline. For me its ok to get no drinks for free on the plane, its most important that the flights are on time and this was always the case. Seats were also comfortable, you even could lean backwards a bit, which is not possible anymore in some other low cost carriers.

### "2 years for your refund"
London to Havana via Madrid. I have just finished talking to yet another operator and she tells me that unfortunately, she can only check that the file has been sent correctly. Poor thing, I would also be sorry to blame the operators who are not to blame for this situation. I have been waiting for 2 years for your refund on a ticket of nearly 600 GBP. My ticket was for March 2020. Following various complaints due to the pandemic, I was given a voucher that I could reuse for another hypothetical flight. One year later, it was still impossible to travel and think of making another ticket, so following the various complaints, I was able to speak with an operator with whom I would have started a refund procedure (March 2021). I also received an email confirmation for my refund, the operator had announced that it would take 5 months to receive the refund and I accepted the continuation I started to contact Air Europa without ever having an answer or an update nothing at all. It's been 2 years now and I still don't know what happened to my money. I also tried to use the voucher out of desperation but it wasn't even valid anymore. I don't know what to do, this situation has become ridiculous and also very annoying | Buonasera, Questo è l’ennesimo sollecito e messaggio che invio in cerca di una risposta. Ho appena terminato di parlare con l’ennesimo operatore, (Roberta 24186) e mi dice che purtroppo lei non può fare altro che verificare che la pratica sia stata inviata correttamente. Poveretta mi dispiacerebbe anche prendermela con gli operatori che non hanno colpe di questa situazione . Sono 2 anni che aspetto un vostro rimborso per un biglietto di quasi 600 GBP. Ho il mio biglietto era per marzo 2020. In seguito ai vari reclami a causa della situazione pandemica mi è stato fatto un voucher da poter riutilizzare per un altro ipotetico volo. A distanza di un anno era ancora impossibile viaggiare e pensare di fare un altro biglietto, cosi che in seguito ai vari reclami sono riuscito a parlare con un operatore con il quale avrei avviato una pratica di rimborso (marzo 2021), ho anche ricevuto una mail di conferma per il mio rimborso, l’operatore mi aveva preannunciato che ci sarebbero voluti 5 mesi per ricevere il rimborso e ho accettato il seguito ho iniziato a contattare air aurora senza mai avere una risposta un aggiornamento niente di niente. Ora sono passati 2 anni e ancora non ho notizia di che fine hanno fatto i miei soldi. Ho provato anche a utilizzare il voucher per disperazione ma non era neanche più valido. Non so cosa fare, questa situazione è diventata ridicola e anche molto fastidiosa

### "Comfy lie flat seats"
Excellent in all respects. The food is brilliant, best ever had on an airline. Comfy lie flat seats, friendly and attentive cabin crew.

### "Best food ever had on an airline"
Overnight flight Miami to Madrid on Air Europa's new business class. Excellent in all respects. Ignore old reviews. Their business class is now one of the best amongst European carriers and strong competition with worldwide carriers. Far better than Iberia or BA. Best food ever had on an airline, comfy and roomy lie flat seats (I'm 6 ft tall), lovely and efficient cabin crew throughout the whole flight.

### "I was the only unfortunate that could not get the menu that I wanted"
The business class on the travel day was not even half full and the flight attendant took my menu choice. An hour after take out when the food was ready she came to inform that I was the only unfortunate that could not get the menu that I wanted. This is unprofessional toward someone who spent a good amount of money for a ticket.

### "very bad experience with Air Europa"
It was a very bad experience with Air Europa. They cancel the flight UX072 from Caracas to Madrid without any notice and I had to wait in a hotel for 4 nights and book another flight with another airline because Air Europa customer service didn't confirm an alternative flight and they didn't confirm the refund yet. Calling their call center was a nightmare every time I had to stay on the line for almost 30 minutes to speak with an agent without any solution.

### "they didn't accept the proof of vaccine"
They didn't let me board because they didn't accept the proof of vaccine on paper instead of the NHS. I was promised by three staff members that they were gonna take my bag out since it was a connecting flight, yet they didn't, and sent it to London. There was no apology or anything like that, , they sent me to their main office, which sent me to a different office, which sent me to baggage claims. Had to book another flight and an hotel for the night, the whole thing costed me almost £500. If you can avoid them at all costs.

### "the service was very poor"
Not Verified | I flew in December to London to Bogota in business class. The staff was amazing and food and all the others service was excellent but I return on Friday arriving yesterday afternoon to London in economy class and the service was very poor. We were offered just one meal in the night of the departure and for the rest of the trip we had to paid the other meal. As I know the other airlines are offering two meals when the journey is long, making us to pay the other meal and we have to pay for the headphones while other airlines offer this service free.

### "didn't refund money, but provided voucher"
We booked ticket from JFK to Madrid but flight was canceled due to covid but they didn't refund money, but provided voucher. Due to travel restrictions we could not travel and anytime we try to book the price is almost twice than I am getting in other better airline so ultimately I am going to lose the money.

### "Chaos during check in"
Chaos during check in, poorly designed check in area. The airline asks you to download all documents to their website / Covid test, Vaccination certificate, Attestation, you get a boarding pass but when you arrive to Terminal 1 the business class agent has no idea about this process. He did not even have a computer. Luggage check in was smooth. Priority lane for security unpleasant and slow. Boeing 787- cabin with 1 -2-1 lie flat seats, nice staff. Cabin overheated. Only 1 wc available.

### "I will never use Air Europa again"
Not Verified | They were offering money and hotel for any whom offered to stay until the next day flight. We did not accept as we needed to travel. 30 minutes prior to take off, they bumped us, as we had not boarded by then and closed the flight. Refused to allow us to board and said the ticket office would replace our tickets for the next days flight. My 7 year old daughter was crying as we were denied boarding and the rude gate attendant, whom I regret not taking her name said to her "this is your parents fault, so don't cry" I asked to her why the she said that to my daughter and she began to insult me and requested we leave the international terminal. It took us over 1 hour to get to the other terminal ticket office. The attendant said we had to pay for a 1 way ticket for each passenger as it was our fault for not boarding plane 1 hr prior to take off, and That paying for new tickets were the only option. I will never use Air Europa again and we do not recommend it to anyone.

### "pleasantly surprised with Air Europa"
I expected the worst due to reviews on here, but was pleasantly surprised with Air Europa. Check in was done through my phone the night before the flight, boarding was a breeze, the flight itself was completely packed. Crew were pretty straight forward and courteous. No free drinks onboard but i managed to buy some OJ for 3 Euros. My ticket included a carry on item plus my backpack. Glad to have chosen Air Europa for this flight. Inflight entertainment was turned on for the full flight.

### "the worst airline ever"
This is the worst airline ever. Could not check in online, called a dozen times and the call would drop, and when I arrive at the airport, the crib service is not available because of that. I had to fly 10 hours with my baby on top of me. They should close.

### "Air Europa is not as bad as people suggest"
Air Europa is not as bad as people suggest. With budget airlines I am a great believer that one should start at 10 and take of points for what you don't like rather than with "posh" airlines the opposite. Bought my one way ticket for around £150 worth of airmiles so cheap as chips and consequently in fairness I should rate this airline with consideration to the fare paid. I've read reviews about Air Europa and feel like I must be flying a different airline. Check in was efficient and both members of staff were very helpful. I got given an exit seat at no charge (I am skyteam elite plus this probably helped). Air Europa use the cibelles lounge in T2, I had a very nice lunch in a relaxing setting before my flight. Boarding straightforward, plane new and clean. Flight left on time, we are scheduled to arrive on time. Meal was basic but tasted good. Reasonable selection of drinks, I am not an expert on wine, I guess it was cheap but was fine, the little dessert was delicious. Staff are friendly on this flight. Seat was old fashioned but consequently more comfortable than others I have sat on recently. Entertainment also not the best but some good films on a nice screen. So starting at 10 where do I dock points? I don't like they charge for ear phones but the next cheapest flight was a 100 quid more so money in the bank to pay 3 euro for earphones. There simply is nothing wrong with this flight so I am going to give it a ten.

### "Would not recommend the airline"
The flight itself was okay regarding plane and onboard entertainment, as well as punctuality. However, leg room is very little and the on board service is an very disappointing for an 11hr flight. Everything extra except for one meal (no choice) and water. Flight attendants also are not necessarily very nice. Ground service is the worst I have seen. You are randomly assigned a seat even if you fly as a couple that booked together. There is no way to change this. Online check-in in advance was not possible. Would not recommend the airline again. Their advantage however is clearly the price.

### "very bad customer service"
Not Verified |  Terrible, very bad customer service. Extremely unfriendly staff, unclean aircraft, horrendous food. Nor worth the money, simply do not travel with this airline. I don't know how can they still be in the market, have the impression even Ryanair is better and friendlier. This is the type of airline who make you feel so unwelcome and uncomfortable that just by flying with them your holiday is ruined.

### "asked for the taxes to be refunded
I could not take my flight and asked for the taxes to be refunded. One told me this is non refundable, another one tells me their commission is higher than the taxes so no refund, and another one tells me if they ask for a refund, the airport will probably reject it. Seriously, at what point did I ask you your opinion!? Never again!

### "don't book, it is not worth the money!"
Not Verified |  Boek nooit meer met deze maatschappij, bedroevend kleine zitplaats,eten weinig en slecht, broodje bevroren en keihard, weinig drinken, of je moet betalen, heb zowel in juli als recent 9 november dezelfde ervaring! Veel mensen klaagden en terecht! Advies: niet boeken is het geld niet waard! Never book with this company again, pitifully small seat, food little and bad, sandwich frozen and rock hard, little drink, or you have to pay, have the same experience both in July and recently 9 November! Many people complained and rightly so! Advice: don't book, it is not worth the money!

### "I had the worst experience"
Unfortunately, last night I had the worst experience. I was waiting in a massive (more than long five flights had one queue for air Europa) queue for more than three hours. Eventually, I realized that it’s less than 30min left until take off. I went to ask what is going on, and the lady sitting by the desk told me that the gates are already closed. Nobody informed us that the queue is not just for the flight Lima, nobody informed that the gates are closing and nobody asked if there are people waiting to go to Lima. So obviously that made me very upset, because I lost not just this flight, but my next flight and all my tickets back from Peru. Plus, the front desk lady was extremely rude. Did not make any effort to help me out, offer me a solution. I am very disappointed and never flying with this airline again.

### "not worth the anger and frustration"
Please never book a flight with this airline. I got stuck in Madrid with a group of 15 people that had all been overbooked. We were promised monetary compensation which I never received after months of dealing with customer support who simply sends out pre-written automatic emails. The few bucks saved are not worth the anger and frustration having to deal with their unprofessional service. I never write reviews, but after this experience I hope I can help somebody else not make my mistake again.

### "We will never fly with Air Europa again"
The worst flights we have ever had! There was nothing to eat or drink, the flight was dense and uncomfortable. We will never fly with Air Europa again. Oh! And I forgot the 3 hours line we waited in.

### "annoying, inefficient, customer-unfriendly"
Not Verified |  I went to Ibiza for a long weekend. My luggage did not arrive, at all. Communication about the status of lost luggage is poor. Service desk can hardly be reached, refuse to speak English, though I mentioned in the dial-menu that I was English speaking. My luggage never arrived, so my weekend was rather ruined. I filed a complaint with all my damages, notes, etc. Despite many calls, emails. even 4 months later I have not been reimburse whatsoever. Very annoying, inefficient, customer-unfriendly to their bones.

### "experience at the front desk was very unpleasant"
My experience at the front desk was very unpleasant. On our ticket it indicated Madrid T1 but the airport screens indicated T2. So we went to T2 where they told us that we had to board through T1. We went to T1 and there was no staff at the indicated number. So we went back to T2 indicating to the priority person that there were no personnel in the indicated place and once again the screen indicated that our check-in area was terminal 1. The priority person only went to check the airport screen when we took out the platinum for life card. What a shame really. Our first and only flight on Air Europa. Mi experiencia en el front desk fue muy desagradable. En nuestro ticket indicaba T1 pero las pantallas del aeropuerto indicaban T2. Asi que nos dirigimos al T2 donde nos indicaron que teniamos que abordar por el T1. Fuimos al T1 y no habia personal en la numero indicado. Asi que volvimos al T2 indicandole a la persona de priority que no habia personal en el lugar indicado y yna vez mas que la pantalla indicaba que nuestra area de cheking in era terminal 1. La persona de priority solamente fue a revisar la pantalla del aeropuerto cuando sacamos la tarjeta platinum for life. Que verguenza realmente. Nuestro primer y unico vuelo en Air Europa.

### "One of the worst experiences ever"
Not Verified |  One of the worst experiences ever. Hardly anything included, had to buy even earphones and in March 2020 all flights cancelled for about 6 months so I paid nearly £2,000 to get back home with another airline. For another 12 months I couldn’t ask for a refund and now need to wait 6 months for the refund to be processed.

### "No Customer Care whatsoever"
Not Verified |  No Customer Care whatsoever, I booked a flight for my girlfriend, son and myself. Later on I realized that I would need to change the dates of my flight. I tried to call the airline to get a rate for changing my flight which turned out to be impossible. Calling the customer care number of Air Europa resulted in 5 calls of about 40 minutes waiting of which only one call got answered eventually. I was asked all the necessary details explaining my situation. Instead of helping me with changing my flight I was only transferred to another department and my call got hung up. I suspect on purpose. Calling again did not succeed, nobody answered the phone again. Also calling the airlines gate directly at the airport did not succeed, I was not attended. In the end I lost my flight receiving no compensation and had to buy a new flight for my new travel dates all due to the complete lack of customer care without any possibility to speak to a representative of Air Europe about my request. This is completely unprofessional and led to a very unprofessional experience.

### "have waited more than 3 hours on hold"
I haven't actually taken a flight with Air Europa because covid travel restrictions smashed my European travel plans. That being said I'm sitting on two round trip business class tickets that I need to cancel or get some type of future credit, but after trying 6 separate times to contact a customer service representative (phone, email, you name it) I am giving up. I have waited more than 3 hours on hold and have yet to have anyone answer. The support line says '24 hours' but on off hours you will just get a recording 'due to circumstances beyond our control, we cannot answer your call right now. Please try again in a few minutes'.

### "absolutely no response"
Not Verified |  I booked flights from Valencia to Palma but my computer auto filled the 2nd passenger name. Realised within a few hours and have spent the last week and a half trying to get this changed. Started out very promisingly response to tweet was DM us the correct name. But despite numerous DMs and tweets absolutely no response. To re-rebook the flight now is 50% more.

### "Very disappointed!"
I booked business because I wanted to use the priority boarding and also keep away from other people due to Covid. At Gatwick airport to get on the aircraft, there was no separate queue for priority boarding so we had to queue with everyone else not following the distance rule and some without masks. The business isn't worth the money you pay since you are treated the same as those in the economy. Very disappointed!

### "Terrible experience"
Terrible experience with this airline! Just arrived in São Paulo from Madrid and it was so far the worst transatlantic flight experience that I ever had! My flight was number UX57, arrived on 12/08/21 around 04:40 in the morning) and all the flight attendants were very rude all the time, having many arguments with several passengers. They served only one option of dinner (in a 10 hours flight) and when they were asked about other options of drinks apart from water they said that they don’t provide for covid reasons. So I asked for a second bottle of water and I was told that I could get more at the back of the plane (so I should cross the whole plane for more water despite we shouldn’t walk in the plane or use toilets that are not next to our seat for covid safety reasons). When I finally managed to go to the back, they gave me a small glass of warm water and that was all we could get. Many seats were empty and despite the fact I was seating in the middle of two other passengers that I was not travelling with, I couldn’t move seats because is a rule in the company to not move seats.

### "poor and rude customer service"
Not Verified |  Everything has gone wrong with this airline: from a 1 week delayed baggage, to poor and rude customer service. Even the website doesn't work properly and when it continued to tell me that it could not find my reservation number I was forced to once again call the treacherous service desk. Treacherous is the right word, as they can hang up on you at any point in the 45 minute queue to speak to an agent. Even once you do get to an agent they have hung up on me multiple times once putting me back on hold. In conclusion everything about Air Europa is horrible. Honestly shocked that so many people are still choosing to fly with them. I know I will never fly with them again and would strongly advise you to do the same.

### "lack of professionalism"
After being used to the overall good service and friendly attitude of the flight crew of Air Europa, it was very disappointing to see the decay in both. During the eight hours flight that departed Miami at 11:30pm, we were served only one meal, it was poor quality and only one choice, no drinks except water was offered during dinner. Snacks and breakfast were excluded “to prevent interaction between crew members and passengers due to COVID’. However, the “interaction” seemed unimportant for selling the same items such as sodas, sandwiches and wine during the flight. If costs need to be cut, be upfront with customer and do not insult customers intelligence by offering lame excuses. I understand new regulations must be enforced but flight attendant’s rudeness and lack of professionalism were highly unsuitable.

### "Nobody can tell me where the luggage is"
Horrible lack of service. Flew with my special luggage, upon arrival my surf gear did not arrive. Upon requesting where my luggage was, the employee said it was not possible to contact anyone at the same company as this is not how they work. Nor could they verify where my luggage was. After filling in some paperwork they assured me all would be arranged and they would start looking for my luggage. I’ve been trying to contact Air Europa all weekend. Nobody can tell me where the luggage is, nor verify it’s even in their possession. 48 hours have passed and I still don’t know if i will get my stuff back.

### "The Ryanair of long haul"
Not Verified |  The Ryanair of long haul. That is to say, bad service, penny pinching and unpleasant flight attendants. I wasn't expecting much, but the meal was even worse than my low expectations. No choice of food so tough luck if you don't like meat and pasta. To drink, a choice of water or water. That was it. No breakfast, though you could pay 3 euros for coffee, not fresh of course. During the night, no water brought round and difficult to find. No attendants were to be found. I asked for a bottle of water before dinner. 3 euros to use earplugs to watch a film! More expensive than a lot of other proper airlines. The only positive - they left and arrived almost on time - I think both about 10 mins late so nothing major. All in all, a really unpleasant experience. I will not be using this company again.

### "just a 33cl water bottle"
An 11 hour flight with just a 33cl water bottle, just pasta a la bolognese. Worse long flight ever for some that doesn’t eat meat and is used to drink at least 2l of water per day.

### "Still waiting for a refund"
Still waiting for a refund for cancelled flights over a year later. Customer service is appalling. Understandable at the beginning of the pandemic that they would be busy, so had call waiting times of over an hour just to speak to customer services. Flight was booked in Feb 2020, and cancelled shortly after that. No confirmation of the cancellation till much later. Eventually reached someone to say that a refund was being processed in Sep 2020. Six months later after numerous follow up chasers to be told that refund is still in process - one year one month later and counting. Do not give them your money!

### "Absolutely disgraceful behaviour"
The pandemic is nearing it's end, and this companies website will not load its change reservation/booking page and their telephone system works periodically. On top of that they tried to charge me nearly £350 to change a flight. Absolutely disgraceful behaviour. I found the flight for the same money elsewhere as what they wanted to change the flight. A flight they charged me £500 for originally. Never again. Burnt, but learnt.

### "I still haven't seen my refund"
Not Verified |  My flight got cancelled due to Covid-19 and dealing with this company has been absolutely shocking and almost non existent. It has been almost a year now and I still haven't seen my refund. Avoid at all costs.

### "confirm that my dispute was denied"
Our flight was cancelled in March 2020 due to the Corona outbreak. At the time, Air Europa had no technical infrastructure for handling refunds. There was no option to request a refund online. I called customer service and was told I could only have a voucher. I asked for a manager and noted that this is against the law in the EU. She said yes yes, you can get a refund, but the only way is to send an email to this address with your ticket information. I sent the email in March 2020, but received no confirmation or receipt acknowledgement. Since I received no refund confirmation, I believed no one would ever read my email. I initiated a dispute with my credit card in May 2020. Chase refunded me temporarily while they investigated. After a month, Chase denied my request and rebilled me in July 2020. They said it is not their job to enforce EU law, and the voucher offer was good enough. To get a cash refund, I had to get it directly from the airline. I reapplied for a refund with Air Europa in August 2020. Ever since then, they deny my requests because they say that their records show my dispute was successful and I need to get the money from my credit card. I have submitted to them the Chase denial letter, my credit card statements showing the rebill, and the date that my bank says they transferred the money to Air Europa. The denial letter from Chase very plainly states I was not successful. The customer service individuals refuse to properly communicate with accounting to find the money and confirm that my dispute was denied. They also lose my case information constantly, and I have to explain everything every time in an effort to get them to find records of when payments moved between Chase and Air Europa. I have two consumer complaints I am waiting for someone to help with. I am beyond upset as the tickets for my family were $2,500. This is the first time I've ever reviewed a company, because I'm not that passionate about the quality of services. I've likely wasted 30+ hours in the past year on the phone with them trying to get to the bottom of this.

### "The worst airline we've ever taken"
The worst airline we've ever taken. Being experienced travelers, Air Europa is in our opinion the worst airline we've ever taken in our lives. They cancelled our outbound flight Lima - Madrid without any notice - not for covid reasons, the customer service is unreachable and even at their office they refused to help us and to propose us comparative flight alternatives, besides the fact that my wife is pregnant (for that reason we bought business tickets) and needed to quickly reach home. They limited themselves to offer us an alternative flight 12 days after our cancelled flight.

### "Decent flight crew service"
First timer here with this airline. Quite inline to my expectations, meaning: they are part of an air alliance, so they should be holding to a minimum service standard. Overall, it was ok. The best aspects of my flights experience: - Part of Skyteam, so my luggage transfer from KLM was easy and seamless - We flew with the Boeing 787, so it was nice and new - Decent flight crew service. The areas where AE can improve:  Their company site can be more user friendly as I had a bit of trouble trying to manage my booking prior to my departure - Seat selection is also not complimentary for everyone during web check in - Inflight entertainment has limited new movies Not bad overall, but I just wish they can offer free seats 48 hr before departure.

### "Customer service very disappointing"
Not Verified |  Customer service very disappointing. It takes already more than 3 months to get a refund. Every time I call the customer service they tell me some other excuse, after I waited 30 minutes in line. One would expect a better organisation for such a big company. Next time other airline!

### "Flight was professionally operated"
Flight was professionally operated, it was an economy class European flight, nothing special, but plane was new, well presented and staff friendly. Pay only refreshments which is more and more frequent but still disappointing. All in all decent flight, recommend Air Europa for short hops.

### "did not allow me to check in"
On August 20th, 2020, Air Europa did not allow me to check in Madrid-Athens because my analysis said "PCR negativo" instead of "PCR negative". I insisted that the supervisor ask her colleague in Athens if the Greek police would admit such obviousness (the result can only say "positivo" or "negativo" so there is no doubt of interpretation), but she refused. Air Europa has management problems and, according to the press, is in technical bankruptcy.

### "I had to take an United Airlines flight"
Horrible service. Paying 100 dollar extra for taking my own luggage. Only one miserable meal on an 11 hour trip. They cancelled my trip only 48 hours before take off because of Covid19, when the lockdown had started long before that. Alternatives were 10 times as expensive, so I had to take an United Airlines flight, with wonderful service btw. Still waiting for my money back after 5 months. Never ever in my life will I even consider flying with these crooks.

### "horrible experience"
Horrible organization. 0 control of people and 0 monitoring of biosecurity measures and protocols. The fleet is handing out alcohol-free cleaning wipes that aren't even antibacterial. The plane looks like a jungle, passengers are moving everywhere and are talking in the aisle, being that it was clearly said at the beginning of the flight that crowds are not allowed in the aisles. People wear the masks without covering their nose, the fleet never distributed any alcohol in gel for sanitizing hands nor masks every 4 hours as it widely known and must be 100% know to airlines. There is no knowledge or transparency as to cleanliness, the Boarding was horrible, all the people piled up and the fleet of the plane controlled nothing. There are like 15 Air Europa workers on board (perhaps more) and none of them are doing anything. I paid to reserve my seat two days before my flight and upon arrival, I was printed the Boarding pass with the seat I booked. When I went to my seat there was a person with the same seat as me, no one in the fleet knew anything and they sent me to sit somewhere else, without giving me a solution. If you have claustrophobia or any reason for not being in a specific seat, never fly with this airline. The food felt like it was made for animals. The drink selection was horrible. Overall horrible experience, people being noisy, breaking every possible rule of biosecurity and the crew was doing nothing all day. I was forced to travel with this airline, but if I can choose again, I will never come with them again. It can be seen they have horrible communication and the crew onboard was useless.

### "lacked some documents to enter the USA"
I booked a flight from Amsterdam to Miami. They denied me boarding in Amsterdam because I lacked some documents to enter the USA because of Covid-19. They said I can re-schedule my flights for a later date through Aviapartner desk at the airport. After 1 hour of searching everywhere with little help . I finally found it. Aviapartner was useless and could do nothing for me. If you don’t let a client enter a flight the minimum you can do is give a voucher or re-schedule. I’m disgusted by their poor service. I will never use them again.

### "tried all ways of getting a refund"
Still waiting for cancellation refund. An atrocious company. On a trip to Cuba, I paid for extra baggage, which showed up on my ticket, but on check-in was told that it had not been paid for. After argument was allowed to board, but lied to by check-in staff and cabin crew about there being a desk in transit at Madrid where I could sort it out for return trip. Spent approx. 90 minutes on phone trying to get someone to sort it out, to no avail. Due to coronavirus, they cancelled return flight 3 days before its date, but didnt make any effort to contact me to inform me. I had been monitoring their website which is labyrinthine, and was totally without information. I only found out about cancellation when my son rang me from England, and he managed to book us on a flight with another airline at a cost of £3000. I have tried all ways of getting a refund, quoting EU regulations etc. After 4 months I have heard nothing since their original offer of vouchers.

### "They only offered a voucher"
My Flights on June 9 was cancelled due to COVID 19, I contacted the company many times to get my money back but the company is not helping at all. They only offered a voucher, I don’t want a voucher a want my money back. Flights was cancelled due to The pandemic No for personal reasons. When I called the company only give me the option for the voucher or Send me to just fly to claim the credit. I been bouncing between both companies with not help and results. I know but the law that I am entitled to get my money back since the pandemic. Customer service need more training and be more helpful at this point I’m still waiting for the company response on this issue but I didn’t heard anything yet. I will never buy again a flight on air Europa or inJust fly is the worst experience!

### "liked the quality of the seat"
Not Verified | São Paulo to Lisboa via Madrid. I liked the quality of the seat. Very good, very polite stewards. The food was not good on the way back but on the way it was good. Yes the very attentive ground staff (check-in). I recommend | Gostei muito qualidade do assento ótima comissários muito educados a comida nao era boa na volta porem na ida era boa sim os funcionários de solo (check-in) muito atensiosos recomendo

### "tries to deny their rights"
Not Verified |  São Paulo to Porto via Madrid. The flight UX58, from São Paulo to Madrid had a delay of 1 hour 54 minutes due to a technical problem. We had to stay inside the airplane, waiting for it to be fixed. Because of this delay, I lost my flight UX1147 from Madrid to Porto. After losing this fight I had to wait more than one hour in the line to change my ticket and got a ticket for the flight UX1145. After waiting for 1 hour after the departure time of UX1145, we were informed that the flight had to be canceled. The mentioned reason for that differed from announcement to announcement, but technical conditions were also mentioned as a cause of the delay. After that, I contacted the company to ask for compensation as Regulation 261/2004 of the European Union, but the company avoids fulfilling their obligation and tries to deny their rights. I do not recommend this company in any circumstances. The costumer support will not try to help, they do not care about the quality of their services and will not deliver the expected service or compensate for the huge mistakes made by the company.

### "canceled and they did not inform us"
Not Verified |  Madrid to New York JFK. Our flight was canceled and they did not inform us! Furthermore, they did nothing to help with out luggage, leaving us to deal with the mess they made! Never flying with them again!

### "overall a very bad experience"
Madrid to Punta Cana. First time to travel with Air Europa, overall a very bad experience. Family with a toddler in emergency row seat. Horrified to find no entertainment system for travellers - a 9 hour flight with no entertainment in this day and age is simply antiquated. The plane was very old and shabby. The main meal was actually OK and free of charge. One drink was provided and a small plastic cup of water too if requested. If you wanted another drink it had to be paid for, yet this service was not always available and only when the cabin crew had finished their duties could we even begin to pay for another drink. The 2nd meal was paid for. During the flight I was so thirsty and with a baby sleeping on my arm I had to get up and try to get a drink of water. The cabin crew were sleeping or reading a book - it was a big ask to have some water - they were rude and sullen and begrudgingly relinquished a small cup of water. Never have I had this experience, normally cabin crew happily walk up and down the aisle with drinks on a tray. The service was absolutely diabolical. On the outbound flight our baby was refused a meal, despite the fact that he eats too. We were told that we should have specifically requested it yet nowhere was this information available. Imagine refusing to feed a baby! On the way back I made sure to request a baby meal in advance. Unfortunately no water was provided, when I asked for water the cabin crew refused until their current duties were complete. Unfortunately even after this no water was forthcoming. Imagine refusing water to a baby! This is a basic human right. What type of people are they? Simply the worst long haul flight I have ever experienced. The with-holding of basic human rights for a baby is simply beyond belief. I would not recommend travelling with this airline and will never fly with them again.

### "did not inform the passengers"
Madrid to Marrakesh. Air Europa cancelled the ticket but did not inform the passengers and passengers are lining up in the airport and they were not returning money or giving any accommodation for international passengers. At least they should have sent out email to inform so passengers could have done some alternative arrangements. At least they should provide a accommodation.

### "a great first experience"
Dusseldorf to Sao Paulo via Madrid. I read some negative reviews and was very pleased to have a great first experience with Air Europe. I will book again for sure! Very nice and welcoming crew, who are flying great machines (Embraer E-190 and Boeing 787). Charging fees for check in bags, choosing seats and extra meals is nearly industry standard procedure and I do not understand why people give negative reviews because of this.

### "have to pay for the breakfast"
Paris-Orly to São Paulo via Madrid. This is a low cost airline, thus, the terminal they were operating is old, the food was poor and the staff was not friendly. Despite of being a 10 hour flight, you have to pay for the breakfast, earplugs, to select your seat and anything else you need. The entertainment system has a good screen but the selection is poor. Check in is outsourced and they were not friendly.

### "experience was very mediocre"
Recife to Madrid. My experience with Air Europa was very mediocre for my partner and I. Our outbound journey to Recife from Alicante was almost a disaster when Air Europa delayed the Alicante flight by 4 hours, so that we would otherwise have missed our connecting flight to Recife, were it not for taking matters in our own hands and making our own way by train to Madrid, thereby disqualifying ourselves from any compensation. They were not willing to put us on another carrier to ensure we made our main flight. The cabin crew on flights to and from Recife did not engage at all with the passengers. The meals were OK but poorly timed. So, flying to Madrid at 10.55pm we were given dinner and nothing else except a lacklustre beverage service 2 hours before landing which we had to pay for. I would have expected a light snack instead of dinner and a proper breakfast. The aircraft was old, no inflight entertainment, and the toilets were dirty. Worst of all, there was no soap in the toilets mid flight, that is a disgrace. I will never fly Air Europa on long haul ever again, and certainly not on an important connecting flight. Their attitude is almost contemptuous of their customers, they obviously think that competitive pricing obviates the need to provide decent service and facilities. Adios Air Europa.

### "All in all a great experience"
Paris to Malaga Air Europa is a LCC but still part of the skyteam group. That's means stuff like a buy on board program and a tight pitch of the seats. Seats are quite comfortable though and not as barebone as others. Staff is generally very friendly and helpful. It's a great thing they display route information on the monitors. Boarding was a bit slow but staff helped to speed it up. All in all a great experience.

### "a feeling something was wrong"
Venice to Cancun via Madrid. The flight got delayed due to bad weather for 2.5 hours, although other companies flew in and out normally. We arrived to Madrid, the plane staff did not know anything. They sent us to room 6, where we thought they would tell us what was happening and when are we flying on. Got there, took our bags and they sent us to their public relations office, we already had a feeling something was wrong. Got to their office, along with at least 30 other passengers that also missed their flights going to north and south america. No apology, nothing. They booked us a plane for the next day not going directly as we should, but with a connecting flight in Mexico City. We lost 2 days going from one plane to the other, from airport to airport. If we knew we were going to have 2 stops and had to wait 16 hours between flights we would pay 500€ less.

### "It was a great trip"
Not Verified |  Milan to Salvador de Bahía via Madrid. It was a great trip. The crew was friendly and had a smile on their faces. The seat that had some problems, like: the light didn't work and it wasn't flat-bed seat in business class. The onboard catering service and everything else was worth it. È stato un ottimo viaggio. L` equipaggio era super cordiale e avevano sempre un sorriso nella faccia. Il sedile che aveva qualche problema, tipo: non funzionava la luce e non era flat-bad, però il servizio di ristorazione e tutto il resto é super valsa la pena.

### "average customer service"
Amsterdam to Madrid. A normal seat, no complimentary beverages. Paid seat selection, average customer service and average crew. Headphones weren’t free. Normal legroom, IFE wasn’t the best.

### "Worst airline I ever took"
Not Verified | Frankfurt to Cartagena via Madrid/Panama City. Had a flight Frankfurt (GER) to Cartagena (COL) with two stops. The first flight came almost two hours too late, so I had to run to my second one, which I only got because it was also late. At the gate, I got told my flight was cancelled, after some phone calls of the gate to the airline I could enter. 9h flight with only one meal (not the vegan meal I preordered and paid for), after one service of drinks I had to pay, even for water. No headphones for the films for free. The staff hardly spoke English, not very friendly either. Got the next flight ok, arrived in Cartagena and my luggage was missing. They told me they’d write me an email if they know about it. Got it back, sent to my hostel after three days. Worst airline I ever took, last time!

### "no personal screen"
Montevideo to Milan via Madrid. I remember having a bad opinion of the airline from previous experiences and during this trip I was reminded why. The airplane is awfully old and unequipped. The entertainment system consisted of large monitors positioned in the middle of the plane with no personal screen, as did other planes until 15 years ago. I was served one glass of water during the flight.

### "Service on the flight is bad"
Buenos Aires to Tel Aviv via Madrid. It was almost impossible for me to check in through their webpage or app. So, in all of my flights I had to check at the counter. Long queues. Service on the flight is bad. During one of my legs, I ordered for purchase a coffee. It took forever to deliver, and it was cold. But, because of their disorganization they didn't charge me. They didnt load my miles to my account. So I had to make a complain. They replied they won't add miles to my account because the name in the reservation is different from the one in the account.

### "No In-flight entertainment"
Zurich to Recife via Madrid. Old A330-202 with a extremely poor food and beverages services, worst the snack served before landing. A frozen toast with ham and cheese warmed up. Staff is friendly. Money for value very low. I do not know honestly who is the worst airline among Tap, Condor and Air Europa flying directly from Europe to Recife. No In-flight entertainment (IFE) and the wifi on air was down. Luckily I downloaded a couple of films on my personal tablet.

### "cabin staff were friendly"
Not Verified | Munich to Madrid. My flight was very good and the cabin staff were friendly. The flight comfort was fine. The business class advantages are priority boarding and security check, welcome drink and free lunch. The seats were the same.

### "went against my better judgement"
Tampa to Miami via Madrid. Like everyone I heard the reviews and I went against my better judgement. So I decided to book a trip to Madrid and do a Spain tour for 2020 NYE leaving right after Christmas on Dec 26th 2019. Well, my 40 min flight from Tampa to Miami was delayed 1.5-hours for a navigation issue. This was with American Airlines. My Air Europa flight was scheduled to depart at 9:45pm. I landed late at 8:17pm. I rushed over from Terminal D to F and when I get to the Air Europa counter they tell me the checked baggage is closed and I would have to do a carry-on. That wasn't possible as my luggage was too big. So they say well you can leave your bag, again not possible as I would have no clothes. Then I say ok, it seems like because you all won't check my bag I can't make the flight. I ask can they just rebook me for the flight tomorrow (not their error) because I can't check my bag. They say I would have to pay for a regular ticket ($800). I'm shocked, I can't afford that. The lady then ignores me as they were closing up the counter (seemed like they just wanted to go home). So I head back to American stranded. American says they can't put me on a flight to Madrid but they can put me in a hotel and get me a flight back to Tampa for no charge. They didn't understand why Air Europa wouldn't just do the right thing as I was there but couldn't check in. I even asked if they could send my luggage a day later and that was a no. Now I wait to talk to a manager because customer service said the gate agent marked me as a no show even though I was there at the Air Europa counter @8:45. My issue is there don't care about your situation, they were rude and was terrible to me. If they can't make it right I will never try to travel with them again and I'm going to share my story with as many people as possible. After reading reviews and seeing how they treat people I'm amazed at how they are still in business. I'm praying for someone at the counter has a heart or else that's $1500 down the drain and a NYE trip in the toilet.

### "I missed the flight"
Not Verified |  On 24 December 2019 I had an Air Europa flight from Madrid to Seville. The outgoing flight was from Madrid at 6.20 AM but don't have the booking code or flight details as I could not avail of the flight due to wrong advice by a lady staff of Air Europa at self check in counter. I asked the lady at self check in counter to check me in at 5.40 AM but she was unable to do so and asked me to stand in check in queue for boarding passes where I wasted 15-20 minutes. When I reached check in counter the guy said he could not help me and directed me to an Air Europa counter on the other side.The lady there spoke to somebody and said that she cannot check me as it was too late. My grudge is why did not the lady at self check in counter send me to this other lady whom I was directed to by this guy at the check in counter after waiting for 20 minutes I told this Spanish speaking lady with limited English at the self check in counter that I had no luggage and the flight was leaving at 6.20 AM. Customer service was very poor and the staff were unhelpful. I missed the flight and had to pay 241 Euros for a train ticket with Renfe.

### "one of the worst experiences"
Gatwick to Salvador Bahia via Madrid. From the very beginning, the service was disorganized and short-staffed. I was left standing in the check-in queue for 90 minutes in order to drop off my case, after I had already taken the time to check-in online. There was no bag-drop facility at Gatwick. Shortly after arriving, I found out my flight was delayed from another passenger. I was confidently assured by on-board staff that the connecting plane would be held for us as there were many passengers however ended up missing the connection to Brazil due to the lengthy delay. I was instructed to go to the Air-Europa desk in Madrid. I arrived. I waited. I was told to go to another desk. Here I waited for no less than 6 hours sitting on a cold floor. No water/refreshments were offered. No apology. No information. Absolutely nothing. People stood with babies. No preference was given to them. I have never in my life been treated so appallingly by any company, never mind a company I have paid a great deal of money to. Just 2 members or staff were left to deal with two planes worth of people. It clearly shows the lack of regard and appreciation you have for your customers. Not even out of sheer courtesy was I asked if my new flight details were suitable, nor was I given any option. The on-board service added to the misery of the entire experience. Flight attendants were not attentive, and I was ignored multiple times. The food was the worst airline food I have come across, and I don’t say that lightly. As a seasoned traveler speaking honestly, it was one of the worst experiences I have had to deal with from start to finish. I have previously had long-haul flight delays with other companies, but never have I experienced treatment like this. I would urge anyone I know to reconsider using your company in the future. Throughout the entire period, I received no correspondence whatsoever; in my opinion showing a total disregard for passengers’ welfare, comfort and appreciation of their custom. I am still in awe at the unbelievably poor level of customer service that was shown. As of today, it has been over a week since the chaotic situation and I still have not received a single email from you apologizing. As a response to a recent complaint via Facebook as the customer service is a 'no reply' email, I received a copied and pasted template email in which none of my complaints were addressed and no apology. My impressions of Air Europa can’t really be any lower. I'd gladly pay extra not to have to go through that again.

### "I can't choose seat online"
Amsterdam to Madrid. Always problems with checking online. Then as a platinum frequent flyer I can't choose seat online and then I have the worst seats. Only airline I have had this problem. Even budget airlines like Ryanair or WizzAir provide better service than Air Europa.

### "really good experience"
Not Verified |  Rio de Janeiro to Madrid. It was a really good experience, I was client of an error that happened in the company's site and It was a surprising experience, I hadn't heard about Air Europa and it didn't seem to me a good one that time. The food was amazing, the seat was fine, staff were really friendly but the entertainment was not that good, it's an app in your mobile phone that has more or less 10 films, but there's a not so expensive Wi-fi.

### "my bag never arrived"
Rome to Madrid. I was at the end of a trip to 4 countries in Europe. I had a carry on bag which I had used for the trip. When I got out to the tarmac someone from the airline told me to leave it and that it could be picked up at baggage claim. Needless to say my bag never arrived and was never found/returned.

### "Really horrid behavior"
Not Verified |  Madrid to Paris. I have never seen such terrible service at a boarding gate. I was traveling with a handicapped person, and they were treated like an afterthought. Every other airline I've ever traveled with, boards people with trouble walking first so they can have an easier time navigating to their seats. Not Air Europa! They bring them in at the very end, without a thought of how hard it would be to walk through the full flight. Really horrid behavior. There was one guy who was giving every passenger boarding a hard time. Putting tags on stupid things like purses. If you hate your job so much, why are you there?

### "Shameless behaviour"
Madrid to London with Air Europa. Frankly I have been treated better as a Ryanair passenger. It's clear that the airline condiders some passengers as "inferior". Shameless behaviour at the boarding gate.

### "a really bad airline overall"
Amsterdam to Madrid. Very bad website! Even though I bought a ticket with them I couldn’t add services or choose my seat. On check-in couldn’t select my seat so they put me on a so-so seat. Then when boarding they changed to an even worse seat! Even though I am Platinum at their Skyteam alliance. This is a really bad airline overall and can’t advise anyone to fly with them. This is not the first time! They also have very poor and strange lounge access which doesn’t make sense. Also seat space poor.

### "Avoid this airline"
Lisbon to Bogota via Madrid. Terrible airline. Do not fly with Air Europa, even if you have to pay a few more dollars for another airline, you’ll be thankful. We were given an e-ticket with no indication that we would need to pay for checked baggage. Upon arrival at airport, we were forced to pay 240EUR for two checked bags. It’s our honeymoon. They didn’t care. Said it wasn’t their problem and that’s the charge for baggage and that they don’t include that in the ticket cost. Avoid this airline no matter what you do.

### "told us we had canceled our flight"
Not Verified |  Miami to Rome via Madrid. My wife and I arrived at the ticket counter in Miami 2.5 hours before our 9:30pm flight to Rome through Madrid and the Air Europa agent told us that we had canceled our flight and the money had been refunded. We explained that they had made a mistake, we had not canceled and they had not issued a refund. I showed them an email dated 2 days earlier confirming our seat selections in business class. Their answer, our customer service is closed now and we have sold the seats to other passengers. They suggested we call their customer service the next day. To add insult to injury they gave us the wrong number for customer service. We did not have the option to delay our travel by one day so we had to take a last minute booking on British Airways. Once in Europe I spoke with Air Europa customer service and they told me it was their mistake, our tickets never should have been canceled and furthermore they noted that no refund had been issued. They eventually issued a refund and told me to write a complaint letter to their customer service which I did. I asked them for either a credit equal to my $10,000 out of pocket cost. After one month they responded that they were sorry about my inconvenience but there was nothing more they would do to compensate me for my costs.

### "made me check my free bag"
Not Verified |  Palma Mallorca to Barcelona. The flight was full and the crew made me check my free bag. When I went to pick it up at the baggage claim it was wrecked. I fly with carry on only so I don’t lose or wreck my bags. Thanks a lot Air Europa. That was brand new bag.

### "The worst company I fly"
Punta Cana to Gatwick via Madrid. The worst company I fly. The aircraft are old and uncomfortable. For a long journey such as Madrid to Punta Cana limited leg space, no entertainment on board. Food terrible. Staff has poor customer service skill. Both times we have been delayed to departure. I don't want to sound so negative., however there's nothing nice I can say about the Air Europa. I will never fly with them again .

### "worst flight management ever"
The worst flight management ever. The plane was really old. We went on the plane, no AC working, 45 degrees, after 90 minutes we had to go back to the terminal, only a strange announcement in Spanish. Theyt held us 3 hours without explanation. Went back on board, with a bang the electricity went off. Dark. Right now I am on the plane, sweating and already 4 hours delay. No announcements on English, but in Spanish the captain said everything is OK and the plane is in a 100 percent good condition. I never had such a bad management of the situation. The captain did not even inform the stewards.

### "not fly Air Europa to Uruguay again"
Düsseldorf to Montevideo via Madrid. Despite showing windsurf equipment consisting of max 1 board, boom, sail and mast as a sport luggage for 75,- Euro extra costs on their website, the airline refused to take 1 windsurf board which I wanted to take. Somewhere in the small prints they mention that the board has to be 250cm in total (length + width + height), just no windsurfboard will match that measurement request. I pointed that out, customer service didn’t care - that is the policy and they don’t care if it is senseless and if all other airlines transport windsurf gear. So I had to leave my board behind. In Madrid 1 h boarding delay with zero announcements on a very late departing flight (24.00). The oldest and most worn out business class I have ever seen. No individual screens, instead handing out IPads 1h after departure with 12 movies, no newer releases. Only 6 passengers in business, 18 seats in total. Crew was hanging curtains on 8 seats which served as “cabins for the crew” on an 12h flight. Later other crew members just hanging out in uncovered seats. Seats are not flat, 15 degrees angle and impossible to sleep on. Food is below average of an economy service on a regular airline. The flight was cheap (2.800 Euro return), which is 800 less than LATAM, 1.500 less than Iberia/ British / AF for the period that I booked. It was a fast transit and overall traveling time was good. Still I will not fly Air Europa to Uruguay again on my annual 2 flights between Uruguay and Europe.

### "entitled to receive compensation"
Madrid to Miami The flight was delayed more than 5 hours and according to the European Regulation (EC)261/2004, I was entitled to receive compensation in the amount of 500 EUROS. I filed the complaint on 09/09/2019, as of today, the claim remains open and I have not been able to reach a person at Air Europa that would give a definitive answer. My calls are handled by a department that can only send email to the "other department". It is frustrating dealing with this company, calls are answered but not processed.

### "horrible customer service"
Not Verified |  Brussels to Havana via Madrid. We had a delay which made us miss our connecting flight. No information was given during the flight, we had to figure out ourselves how to get to the customer service desk in Madrid, where we waited an hour and a half in line. We got a reschedule to the next day. Until today I am waiting for a compensation conform the European legislation. Until today they keep trying to avoid taking their responsibility. The flight back the airplane was dirty, late and the staff didn't get the ticket system started so gave us handwritten tickets and luggage stickers. A free seats policy is a recipe for disaster, yet this company didn't consider this. My luggage got lost in Madrid and returned to me day afterwards. This wasn't surprising as our plane yet again had inexplicable delays and we had to run to catch our connection. The staff was so friendly to advise us to run to the other terminal after wasting time handing out tickets in the arrival hall one by one. The terminal was a 20 minute run away. Horrible experience, horrible customer service.

### "Horrible Experience"
Horrible Experience, our flight was suppose to leave Madrid at 3.25 pm instead it left at 11.30 pm. They gave us a form to complete for reimbursement, any delays after 4 hours you will be compensated 600 euro. After a month and a half calling no one ever helped me. They will transfer calls from one department to another and then disconnect your call. When I was finally able to speak to someone I asked to speak to a supervisor and they said that the supervisor couldn't speak to me and that their supervisor were there to help the employees if they had a question. Never received a compensation for the horrible experience and over 8 hours of waiting at the airport. Horrible customer service and experience, I will never fly with Air Europa again.

### "delayed for over 8 hours"
Madrid to Miami. Wish I could leave a zero. Our flight was delayed for over 8 hours they tell us to fill out a form to be compensated, this was over 2 months ago and nothing has been done, we call several times and they say we need to be transferred to the claims department, when they transfer us and after being on hold for 30 minutes the line cuts off, this is every single time we call. We ask to have the claims direct number and they say we can only be transferred to that number. We also email over and over and they have an auto-return email but never answer the questions in our emails. They claim to have the best prices on tickets and then they charge us $200.00 one way for luggage. We ask if they have a supervisor that we can speak with and they say they do have supervisors but they are there to help them not the public. This airline is a joke.

### "excellent customer service"
Not Verified |  Punta Cana to Gatwick via Madrid. When I initially booked with Air Europa, I heard mixed reviews and was worried. Having travelled with them, both outbound and inbound, they are a great company. Some budget airlines could take a leaf from their book. The staff were so polite and helpful. Nothing was too much trouble. We had a long journey both ways and it was the easiest journey I have ever travelled. The luggage transfer was seamless and waiting at the destination with no trouble. Any questions asked to cabin crew were answered with manners and excellent customer service. Thank you Air Europa for making a long haul flight so much more enjoyable.

### "the worst experience"
Medellin to Madrid. This was the worst experience. First of all, we could not do the check in online, because the system kept crashing (we tried all devices). Since we could not do this online check in, we could not pick the seats. It was a problem, because we were travelling with the baby, and we wanted to be pick a seat with a crib for him. On board, the screens were not working for the whole row, 1/3 of the passengers. The lack of entertainment was a little problem, compared to the fact that without that screen we could not call the assistance when we needed (to fill baby’s bottle with water, for example). We had to physically walk around the plane looking for the staff (imagine doing that with a baby). When the screens broke, people could not turn off their reading lamps, having to sleep with the light in their faces. The chairs were the most uncomfortable. We took this airline because it was new, and we wanted to try this one. Never again.

### "Please improve your food service"
Not Verified |  Madrid to Medellin. The airplane and stuff were surprisingly positive. What is an absolute no-go is the food! Comprehensively untasty, bad vegetarian option, fruits taste like vinegar. Please improve your food service, especially on long distance flights

### "our bags didn’t make it"
Not Verified |  I understand budget airlines but you really get what you pay for. I flew an internal flight from Rome to Porto via Madrid to start my 5 week trip. It was cramped, no service but that’s what you pay for and usually fine for a short flight. One of The ACs above my partner didn’t work which was a struggle in the mids of the European summer. But when it came to getting off the plane. Everyone started getting their cabin baggage off and were waiting as usual. An arm rest actually broke off with just the weight of a cabin bag on it. And then when we realised our bags didn’t make it - to get shunned to person to another, with no one wanting to take responsibility for it, it’s been a frustrating week. We lodged the PIR form straight away. We were hopeful that the bags would arrive within the 24hours like normal. But no luck. The number they provided for us to contact didn’t work, we had to find the number from online. There was a lot of broken English on the other side with call service staff not being able to provide any info apart from “we will write a note and follow it up” 2 days later they found our bags. 3 days later we get one of the two bags. Half a week later we’re still waiting for find where the other bag is - apparently it’s still sitting in one of the airports but they cannot tell us which one or when we will get it. As we were moving around every few days, there was at least one call on our side everyday to check up but no communication on their side. There appears to be a lot of “let me put a note on the file” but no reading of “notes” from each staff. We are leaving Lisbon tomorrow morning and we were actually told “maybe best option is to leave your bag in Lisbon airport for a few days and you can pick it up when you past through to leave Portugal”. Sure with the 100 euro max compensation Air Europa claims they will give: guess I’ll have to buy myself everything from scratch and see my bag at the end of my league here. I wish I read all these reviews before travelling with this airline as it appears people have had similar Experiences. My friends and I are frequent travellers who have had bags delayed or lost a fair few times in all Our flights. But with the lack of caring or help from the customer service team- I would definitely avoid flying with them again.

### "smells the whole flight"
Amsterdam to Madrid. I paid the XL seat and people were constantly passing by my feet to go to the bathroom, it smells the whole flight because of being near the Bathroom. Delay of course, ground service was poor.

### "This airline is cheap for a reason"
Flew London to Madrid via Santa Cruz Bolivia with Air Europa. You have been warned. This airline is cheap for a reason. 11 and a half hour flight with broken seats that didn't recline, no working TV's and rude cabin staff. We did insist that we move from the broken seats/no working tv's but were simply moved to other broken seats with no working TV's by the cabin staff who seemed to enjoy being rude and unhelpful.

### "Never again Air Europa"
During our trip from Madrid to Miami, Air Europa lost one of our suitcases. I filled a PIR report in Miami immediatetely after landing, and also called Air Europa every day during the vacation, to ask for the suitcase. It was not found. After vacation was finished, I immediately sent a formal claim by post to them, but they refuse tok take any responsibility. They are not able to tell me where the suitcase is, and they are not willling to pay any compensation for the lost luggage. Very irresponsible. Never again Air Europa.

### "delays followed by cancellation"
Madrid to Paris. Worst experience with delays followed by cancellation with no announcement, no hotel booking. Flight itself is very bad, seats unconfortable, staff unfriendly. They do not even offer free water or coffee. Never again

### "no tv screens, nothing"
Havana to Madrid. On the 9 hour flight nothing to do, no tv screens, nothing. No phone charger. Plane was very dirty with front seat pocket hanging off. Staff not very friendly.

### "first meal with no option"
Lima to Madrid. The boarding went well and fast and nobody though about any delay, but once on board the plane we waited without any communication by the crew for 1 hour. The crew was stressed and nervous, after 1 hour from departure they served the first meal, with no option, only chicken curry with rice. After the first meal the crew disappeared, they didn't offer water or fresh/hot wipes. The multimedia was good, many films and good entertainment but you have to purchase the headphones on board for 3€ (with low quality sound).

### "No boarding in groups"
I flew UX89 from Madrid to Santo Domingo. No boarding in groups, so usual chaos. When I approached my seat (47D), I noticed someone already was sitting there. A crew member came up and told me I was wrong (I wasn’t) and demanded I should take the seat behind it (48D in my opinion). I didn’t argue. Then of course a passenger who had booked 48D came up. The same steward suddenly explained to me that I am plain wrong and that 47F in fact was 47D. It took 2 other crew members to convince the steward that I was right. Unbelievable! A crew that is not acquainted with seat numbering! Horrible food, 3 Euros for headphones on an intercontinental flight. Of course my steward did not issue the immigration forms before landing, so customs took additional time.

### "Lost my luggage"
Lost my luggage on my way from CDG to Valencia. Offered no compensation for expenses occurred and have still not recovered my suitcase after 4 days. No food or drinks available on-board, cabin crew only speak Spanish and ignore you if you ask for water. Return flight delayed 3 hours. Would not fly with Air Europa again.

### "charged for a carry on"
Valencia to Paris CDG. This is a terrible airline. They charged for what is usually a carry on suitcase at 60 euros. Rude staff. No free food on board. Do not care about their customers.

### "flights have been running late"
Tenerife to Gran Canaria. Flew this airline second time and both flights have been running late although the route is not long. I'm using companys own app for information and it's mainly that why I reviewing the airline. Supplied information was different compared with one coming from a third party app. CheckMyTrip knew more than an hour before companys own app the actual departure time. I can understand that reading security procedures day after day can be monotonous but still it is not acceptable that it is resulting total mess when a cabin personnel is trying to read it too fast. Spanish version sounded right but the English one was unacceptable. No one with good knowledge in English were able to understand it.

### "food for purchase"
Tel Aviv to Madrid. The good, I flew twice in one month and both flights departed on time. My bags where not lost and the cabin was clean. The bad, only free thing in the meal and beverage service was water, and that’s if you could catch them zooming down the aisle. They would only say, “food for purchase”, and if you didn’t respond to that, you were out of luck. Twice I had to look over my shoulder and tell them I wanted some water. No napkin, just a small cup oh water. After the service was over, they where not seen in the aisle unless someone pressed there call button.

### "language was aggressive"
Paris to Santa Cruz via Madrid . Two friends and I travelled to Santa Cruz from Paris. In Orly Paris, we checked in at an Air Europa’s counter and obtained our boarding passes. On our way to the security check area, a staff member of Air Europa stopped us and told us that we should send our backpacks. So we went back to the check-in counter and told the same lady what had happened. The lady at the counter weighed our backpacks (each of them was less than 10 kg) and gave each of us an orange tag which read “Cabin luggage”. When we showed our boarding pass at the gate, the same staff member stopped us. He started to react in an agitated manner towards us, accusing us of NOT doing what he told. We explained to him that we had re-confirmed at the counter and had been given an orange tag. He removed our tags without our consent. He demanded us to pay for two backpacks or we could not board with our backpacks. We tried to reason with him and at the same time rearranged our backpacks. I then tried to transferred some clothes to my handbag. He lied to me that I could not do that and only one piece of “luggage” was allowed on board. Based on his statement, my friend and I decided to pay a total of 240 euros. His reaction was violent and misleading. His language was aggressive. He did not follow Air Europa’s publicly available information on hand baggage. Our backpacks were within the 55cmx35cmx25 cm (the sum of the three dimensions must not exceed 115cm). We also had the right to bring one handbag. It is totally unacceptable.

### "Food was not edible"
Planes were old and not well kept up. Food was not edible unless one was very hungry. I did not eat. However staff was friendly. Luggage policy was sneaky and expensive. Will not travel with this company again no matter how “cheap” the flights are.

### "charge for the earphones"
Guayaquil to Alicante via Madrid. The old seats the TVs do not work, they charge for the earphones 3 euros. If you sleep they do not give you any food. When you buy the tickets give you a suitcase of 23kgs. ES: Los asientos viejos los televisores no trabajan cobran por los audífonos 3 euros si te duermes no te dan de comer Cuando compras los tickets te dan una maleta de 23kls incluido ala me dejaron pasar al regreso me cobraron 120 euros y si les pagas en dólares 160 rediculo otras aerolíneas te dan 2 maletas de 23kls

### "Very negative experience"
Not Verified |  Very negative experience in my first flight with Air Europa. In my route from Dusseldorf to Bogota, the departure was delayed and in overall took about 2 hours more than original schedule without any care for customers connection. We lost our connection with Avianca at Bogotá to reach Bucaramanga. It was the last flight in the night to our final destination and we had to spend the night in Bogotá. Air Europa didn't want to approve support for a night hotel (nor dinner or breakfast) and their attitude and service was unacceptable and rude. We had to cover our expenses that night. They only gave us a letter accepting the delay was their fault. Luckily the other airline didn't charge us for a new flight the next day. Additionally, the food during flight was horrible and they charge you for the headphones on a intercontinental flight? The service during flight to place the hand luggage was also rude, most people was asked to place it below the seats, which is very uncomfortable for such a long flight.

### "were changed to other seats"
Madrid to Miami. My husband and I occupied the seats 15K and 15H for which we paid an additional amount since they are located in a of the eight emergency exits. We had to choose these seats because my husband measures 6 feet and simply does not fit in the seats of the tourist class. The day before traveling I fell and broke my left arm which was in a sling and it hurt a lot. When we were leaving Madrid, the purser in an aggressive tone tells me: "Ma'am, you have a sling in your arm? I say yes and he says: "You do not know that with a physical impediment Can not travel in that seat? I say no, I did not know and I did not know when I bought the tickets because I could not predict that I would break my arm. He answered that in the instruction manual he said it very clearly, that he did not have time to change his seat but that for the landing we had to change. All that in a condescending tone as if I had committed a crime. When we arrived in Miami, during the landing, it did and my husband and I were changed to other seats in which of course he did not fit and I was super uncomfortable. The landing lasted more than half an hour because we had to wait for a landing site. On the trip that lasted 10 hours, not once did he come to ask if he was okay or needed something. I do not doubt that he was right and that he was applying the regulation, but the form and tone he used was uncourteous and indelicate. I do not have to know the instruction manual. I'm not a flight attendant. And really in case of needing to open the emergency exit I do not think there would have been any lack of volunteers to do it. ES:  Mi esposo y yo ocupabamos los asientos 15K y 15H por los cuales pagamos una cantidad adicional ya que estan ubicados en una de las ocho salidas de emergencia. Tuvimos que escoger estos asientos porque mi esposo mide 6 pies y sencillamente no cabe en los asientos de la clase turista en la que se viaja como sardinas en lata. El dia antes de viajar me cai y me rompi el brazo izquierdo el cual llevaba en cabestrillo y me dolia muchisimo. Cuando ibamos saliendo de Madrid, el sobrecargo en un tono de lo mas agresivo me dice: "Señora Ud. tiene un cabestrillo en el brazo? Le digo que si y me dice:"Ud no sabe que con un impedimento fisico no puede viajar en ese asiento? Le digo que no, que no lo sabia y que tampoco lo sabia cuando compre los boletos porque no podia predecir que me iba a romper un brazo. Me contesto que en el manual de instrucciones lo decia bien claro, que ya no le daba tiempo cambiarme de asiento pero que para el aterrizaje nos tenia que cambiar. Todo eso en un tono condescendiente como si yo hubiera cometido un delito. Cuando llegamos a Miami, durante el aterrizaje, asi lo hizo y mi esposo y yo fuimos cambiados a otros asientos en los que por supuesto el no cabia y yo iba super incomoda. El aterrizaje duró mas de media hora porque hubo que esperar sitio para poder aterrizar. En el viaje que duró 10 horas, ni una sola vez se acercó a preguntar si estaba bien o necesitaba algo. No dudo que tuviera razon y que estuviera aplicando el reglamento pero la forma y el tono que usó fue en el mejor de los casos bastante grosera, poco cortés e indelicada. Yo no tengo porque saberme el manual de instrucciones. No soy flight attendant. Y realmente en caso de necesitar abrir la salida de emergencia no creo que hubieran faltado voluntarios para hacerlo.

### "horrible, worst service"
Milan to New York via Madrid. Horrible airline. I have never had such bad experience before. I missed my connecting flight and apparently the airline shows no care for its customer. The airline customer service was rude and unclear, hung up on me multiple times. Also, they must take break around noon so the office was closed and I was unable to reach anybody. Had to waste my 1400 dollar ticket at the end, because they keep wasting your time. Never taking this airline again. Just horrible, worst service.

### "horrible service"
Gatwick to Havana via Madrid. Delays, old aircraft, disgusting food on top of horrible service. Charges €3 for headphones, No information was given about flight service (meals times etc. ), No vegetarian meal, no option to pre-order online or find onboard. Never again.

### "do not care about client services"
Worst experience ever. Flight delayed for almost two hours, almost lost my connection in Madrid to Lisbon, and they lost my luggage, no explanation, they do not know where my bag is! They just ruined my family vacations. They do not care about client services. Flight are cheaper with Air Europa but it’s not worth it.

### "Never again using this airline"
Gatwick to Madrid. Very bad airline. We arrived 3 hours prior the flight and asked to be seated together and they say you have to pay for that. Unacceptable! Never again using this airline.

### "a perfect day in the sky"
I did a day-return flight from Amsterdam to Madrid on Air Europa who uses a one-way pricing (even for business class) so a same day return is more attractively priced than other carriers that offer business class. Air Europa also operates this route with a wide body A330 where others use narrow body aircraft. On my outbound flight to Madrid I was on a A330 with a 'newish' club seating, which has 4 rows of 2x2x2 seating, the seats are slightly angled towards each other and there are individual entertainment systems. I found the seats comfy but not very spacious. On the return I was on an older A330 that offers only 3 rows of 2x2x2 seating (in the same space as the newer A330). I loved the older A330. Seating is so classic and spacious and the seats are hugely comfortable. There is no individual entertainment on this aircraft. My outbound flight was delayed by about 1h30 and I found the Air Europa app to give conflicting information on the actual departure times. On the return the app told me the flight would be delayed, but it did leave in time. Where Air Europa really stand out is on its club catering. Incredibly fresh and healthy: beautifully presented. Hands down the best catering on an inter-European flight. Cabin crew were absolutely lovely too. Extremely friendly and present in the cabin. I noticed on expert flyer that business class would be almost empty and appreciated the airline did not fill this section up with upgrades, friends and family at the last minute as many other airlines do. So all in all it was a perfect day in the sky.

### "never had an airline charge for water"
Seville to Mallorca. The night before our flight, I checked-in online. I tried checking in via the webpage and app but neither seemed to translate to English, so I asked the concierge of the hotel I was staying at to help me check in. I declined to select a seat, pressed “next” and all of a sudden was given the e-ticket. At no point did the app prompt for luggage information (which would have cost 30 euros if checked- in in advance). The next day at the airport, I tried to explain this to the customer service desk, but they told me I had to pay 60 euros – more than the cost of my flight! Further, our flight was delayed by 2 hours: we were supposed to depart at 10:15pm but instead, we only boarded around midnight. Since it was so late at night, the stores were closed and we couldn’t buy snacks. Once we got on the plane, we asked for water, but we were informed that all snacks – including water – were for sale only. I have never had an airline charge for water, especially after such a long delay. This was unhumanitarian. In both situations, it seemed like the airline was capitalizing from situations that they created or that were in their control. I wrote to their customer service department explaining this and they still don’t seem to get the wrong they have done. I have flown with many airlines around the world – just within this Euro-trip, I had flown with 4 or 5 different airlines, of which 3 of them were discount airlines- and have never gotten such poor treatment. I don’t expect much, just some water and the opportunity to check in luggage when I check-in for my flight 24 hours before my flight!

### "Terrible service - sneaky charges"
Terrible service - sneaky charges (who doesn’t make it obvious that there’s no baggage included for a long haul flight before you arrive at the airport and then charge £100 to add it for one way?) I gave them plenty of notice for a special meal but not only was 2 days not enough, they didn’t actually offer vegetarian meals. I had to have a vegan meal in order to eat which was the worst (vegan food in general - nice), this was just boiled vegetables and a fruit salad, terrible. Flight entertainment pretty limited.

### "leg room was atrocious"
Malaga to Venice via Madrid. The staff's English was extremely poor. One of them even refused to speak to me in English. The leg room was atrocious. The online check-in process is a joke. We checked in two days before the flight, we were two people on the same booking, but were still assigned seats in different rows. I send them a Facebook about this. It took them more than two days to reply. We picked up our bags at Madrid because we had to spend the night there. The bag-drop queue was horrible in the morning. So disappointing. All in all, the ticket was a bargain, but next time I'd rather pay more and fly a different airline.

### "This is unacceptable"
Not Verified |  Valencia to Seattle via Paris. Do not book a flight through another airline that routes you through Air Europa. I made the mistake of booking a flight through Air France which coshares with other airlines and our flight out of Valencia was through Air Europa to Paris then connecting on to Seattle via Delta. Unfortunately because of the coshare booking, the Air Europa website would not allow us to check-in for our flight online. Being in a foreign country without transportation, we had no easy way of getting to the airport the day before our flight and were unable to check-in for our long 14 hour journey in order to get good seats. I spent 35 minutes on the phone waiting to talk to a customer service agent just to be told the only option is to check in at the airport. This is unacceptable in my opinion, it was not my choice to be routed through this airline and every passenger should have the option of checking in online. We were also unable to reserve seats because of this issue so my husband and I could not sit together on our 2hr+ flight to Paris. Very disappointing end to our honeymoon.

### "Good option for London"
Madrid to London. Good option for London. 2 * 2 configuration so feels more spacious. Was given silver tier just as reward for using Air Europa on and off for two years

### " Will not fly them again"
I flew round trip Miami-Madrid, same route from last year at this time. This year they charged for luggage. $150 surprise charge on the way out. Food was worse than last year. Headphones were sold, duty free item sales too. The return leg was worse; flight UX097 Madrid to MIA. Purchasing the baggage before hand online was $100, but it did not allow purchase. It did not show the incoming flight purchase so website did not allow return purchase? I had to call it in. The flight tonight was the worse ever. Sat on tarmac for 30 min. Turbulence was announced after the fact. Mint tea only available on first meal not 2nd. Wine the same. I take full responsibility for the distraction this caused as I left my phone in the pocket. I immediately went to the desk after going through customs and they did not find my phone. It's sad because all my pictures are there. Sadly there is a $30 fee to file a claim. They dont hold staff accountable. 800 number is in Spain time and could not help. Will not fly them again.

### "quality low-cost, price premium"
Milan to Santa Cruz via Madrid. The quality of a low-cost at the price of a premium flight (EUR 2000). In summary: - the first flight (of four) was delayed by 2 hours. Reportedly, it is everyday so, there were people that already knew that. But other passangers lost the connection in Madrid (we didn't) - very limited legroom, and we had to pay extra EUR 20 each for choosing the seats! Otherwise the system would have split the two of us and randomly placed us next to the toilet - no entertainment screen for a flight of 12 hours (one way). On the return flight there was, but the choice was frankly appalling and you had to pay extra EUR 3 for headsets - food is terrible. Not possible to select menu in advance, so you're left with two choices, but halfway they finished already one dish, so there was no choice at all. A serious problem if you are coeliac or vegetarian etc - food is insuficient. In 12 hours daylight flight we received only a small lunch 30 min after departure (consisting of a small portion of pasta and a dessert) and a mini-breakfast (a mini-sandwich) 30 minutes before landing. So for more than 10 hour they let you starve - they didn't even serve water for 10 hours. Actually you do not see a single flight assistant for 10 hours. Flight assistants (in the rare moment they can be perceived) never smile and treat all passengers quite rudely.

### "improve a lot of things"
Amsterdam to Madrid. I could have flown with KLM for the same money but I decided to fly Air Europa for the first time because a Boeing 787 would be operating the flight. Always nice to fly a wide body aircraft on a short European route! I checked in 40 hours before departure with their IOS app. The app is very basic because there was no way to select a seat. I was asked if I wanted to pay more for a seat with more legroom and after selecting no, I was randomly allocated to a middle seat without the option to choose an isle or window seat. After the boarding pass was loaded in my wallet I was shocked because my name was misspelled. My surname was shown twice, while my name was correctly spelled on the reservation. To avoid being denied boarding I called their service center on Saturday. After waiting for 50 minutes on the line, I explained the problem to an agent and first he tried to let me pay 18 Euros for changing my name. I didn't agree because my name was correctly spelled on the reservation so something must have gone wrong from their side. After a lot of noise from his keyboard he told me it was OK and my name would be correct on the boarding pass. Not a great first impression! The flight itself was on time. At the airport I was able to change my seat to a window seat and add my Flying Blue number because it was mysteriously gone from the booking as well although I entered my frequent flyer number during the booking process. The aircraft (EC-MLT) didn't look in a good shape for a 2 year young aircraft. Filthy carpets, filthy seats and a grey/brown sludge coming from the air vents on the side and overhead panels. The entertainment system however is good and legroom is sufficient. On board everything is for sale just like a low-cost carrier. Not that I expect a meal or a sandwich on a 2 hour flight but a water or coffee would be appreciated. They advertise as a full service SkyTeam airline, but they are just another low-cost carrier. The flight landed on time at Madrid an after a long taxi ride we arrived at terminal 1. The jet-bridge was connected and shortly afterwards the jet-bridge retracted again, because this was an intra EU-flight and terminal 1 is only for non EU-flights. Airstairs arrived and we were bussed to the Schengen arrival area of terminal 2. I had my trolley checked in and waited at belt  for the luggage to arrive. Only the priority luggage arrived and after 30 minutes the system said that all luggage was being loaded at the belt, while there were at least 100 passengers waiting for their luggage to arrive. Air Europa staff said 10 minutes, 10 minutes but nothing happened. It seemed they didn't care and there was confusion because suddenly luggage from another flight popped up on the belt and the Amsterdam flight disappeared from the screens. Finally 90 minutes after landing the luggage arrived. I think the luggage was transported to terminal 1 (where the aircraft arrived) instead of terminal 2. 90 minutes waiting for your luggage to arrive is insane. While the flight itself was fairly OK Air Europa needs to improve a lot of things to make it comfortable for passengers to fly with them.

### "such cramped seats"
Asuncion to Madrid. I was expecting a rough ride from reading  reviews. Although some aspects were confirmed as being bad (ground service was chaotic on the way out, the seats were extremely cramped) others were either tolerable (food) or even good (cabin staff service). I think that the cabin crew are making an effort to improve. On the way out the air-conditioning fell out after boarding and the passengers became restless and then angry, it was the cabin crew that had to take the brunt of their anger. They tried to patch things up by serving iced water. They showed professionalism. I have never encountered such cramped seats before. I don't think it is advisable for tall people to fly with this airline. Although I am not particularly tall, I kept bumping my knees against the seat in front of me and had to deal with the man's anger.

### "Great staff and great service"
Barcelona to Tel Aviv. Flight was 4:00 hours, check in at El Prat Airport was fast and quick, ground staff was friendly and even when I had overweight on my checked luggage they did like they didnt see and gave me pass without paying. Because the flight departed at 00.35 there wasn't a duty free or a meal service. The landing was good and the staff on board was friendly. Great staff and great service.

### "cabin crew nice and friendly"
Tel Aviv to Barcelona. The flight length was 4:30 hours, the check in was very slow and not comfortable, only 2 check in desks for 160 passengers. The cabin crew was nice and friendly, but another minus is that there is no free meal service but the landing was very soft and the food was quite tasty, seating system is unknown, do the first ones to register seat in the end? Finally, the flight was not more than nice.

### "would recommend them"
Gatwick to Madrid. Much better than Iberia or British Airways. Cheaper flights, more legroom, more comfortable seats, better food and crew. They don't suffer from corporate arrogance and poor customer service of Iberia so would recommend them for flights within and to Spain.

### "charge for seats and luggage"
Miami to Milan via Madrid. They charge for seats (each flight) and luggage. The information on the e-ticket about the luggage charge is very small and easy to be overlooked. When paid at the airport check-in you pay 50% more than online. On my way back I made sure to pay online (and never more use Air Europa) but the service doesn't work. To pay for the seat it took me more than an more, a single operation that was showing wrong for systems reasons. The luggage purchase results impossible, which means that instead of paying $100, I will have to pay $150. Their system is bad, service is bad, the food is awful. What seemed to be a good price ticket ended up being more expensive and much less enjoyable than other flights.

### "charge for each piece of luggage"
Miami to Madrid. They will charge you for each piece of luggage without blinking an eye. For one suitcase they charged me $300 hundred dollars round trip. 99.9 percent of airlines will never charge you for one suitcase, let alone $300.00 to travel overseas. I don't how Spain is such a beautiful country but such a bad business!

### "no functioning service"
Zurich to Lima via Madrid. Fly Air Europa and you may be lost in the sky. No responsibility for connection problems! No functioning service or service staff on site. Simply lost in the sky.

### "poor customer service"
❌ Not Verified |  Flew to Mallorca for the Mallorca 70.3 Ironman race the week before last. I purchased what I thought to be all Delta flights however Air Europa were the operators for all of the legs of my flight. I brought my racing bike in its travel case complete with all gear - helmet, cycling shoes, and race day necessities (not to mention a very pricey TT bike). Upon arrival to Mallorca Air Europa informed me that my bike was "lost" so I filed a claim. It took 15+ phone calls initiated by me, posts on Twitter to actually put some pressure on the airline and 5 days to locate my bike. Upon "localization," they tweeted at me and said the bike would arrive in Palma at 3:10PM that day. I called and confirmed the flight and nearly five hours after the flight landed and no bike, I called Air Europa who informed me that the bike was being held in Madrid and being sent back to JFK since I was leaving Mallorca on May 16. However, I was leaving Mallorca on May 19 on their same airline (information that was right in front of their faces). I have never experienced sure bad communication, poor customer service and a generally bad business acumen in my entire life - and I've traveled to four continents on numerous airlines without issue. I suggest to never fly Air Europa if you value your possessions and your time.

### "luggage not included in price"
Valencia to Milan Malpensa via Madrid. Good aircraft (two flights). High price and luggage not included in price (one 15Kg bag for two passengers). This is not explained in the site when buying ticket. Thus I had to pay 60 Euro for a single bag. In addition, Fee requested for selecting seats. Thus: a return only flight for 2 people was 400E = 200E each. Airlines are profiting of you: luggage allowances and seat selection fees (as well as priority).

### "the cabin was extremely hot"
One way flight from Lisbon, Portugal to Frankfurt, Germany via Madrid, Spain. Flight was delayed by over an hour in Lisbon and once we boarded sat on the tarmac for 30 minutes which was blamed on "ATC Regulations", a term used more than once as an excuse (keeping in mind this was a relatively quiet Sunday morning/afternoon). The flight attendant at least handed out water as the cabin was extremely hot. Once we arrived into Madrid over an hour late I was relieved to see the gate for the next leg was right next door, not that it mattered as the flight was also delayed. We boarded around 30 minutes late and it was then the captain announced that yet again due to "ATC regulations" the flight was not allowed to take off for another one hour and fifteen minutes! He said the reason they boarded us was they hoped the situation would improve. Again, the cabin was around 40c however no water was offered as the passengers sweated it out. After 40 minutes the plane finally took off and then we watched the incredibly slow progress of the flight attendants to serve us some sort of refreshment. Despite having a glossy catalogue full of food when I asked about ordering any of it I was told these flights don't carry food as the flight was too short (at this stage I had been on the plane for over 2.5 hours with 1 hour to go). The flight landed in Frankfurt at 7pm, 1 hour and 20 minutes later than scheduled. I believe Air Europa have little or no concern for their passengers safety forcing them to sit in hot planes for extended periods of time because they have issues with their take off and landing slots at airports. I would not recommend flying with them.

### "know how to ruin a nice trip"
Amsterdam to Cancun return via Madrid. I used the service of bringing water sport equipment. All arranged and discussed prior to the trip and no costs used (as per website). All ok on the flight to Cancun and all verbal ok for the flight back. Once at the check in, after the luggage was on the belt we could chose to pay 150 euros or leave the stuff in Cancun? Air Europa know how to ruin a nice trip.

### "they say the bag is included"
Miami to Madrid. This is the worst airline by far. I got misled by the direct flight to Madrid but would never ever do this again. On their website they say that the bag is included but when you get to the airport you find out that they charge $150 per bag each way. I specifically called before I purchased the tickets to confirm if the bags are included in the price and I was told they are. When I got to the airport the flight was delayed 3.5 hours and they informed me that I need to pay $150 per bag but because of the delay I’ll pay $100. I handed them my credit card and they charged me $450! When I asked why they said $300 but they charged $450 they said that it’s in the system and it can’t be changed. I asked to talk to a manager and I was told he was at the gate. I went to the gate they told me that he is at the check in counter?

### "crew welcoming and helpful"
Madrid to Vigo. Really good cabin crew. I fly Air Europa within Spain and their cabin crew are always welcoming and helpful. Far superior to Iberia. They use smaller jets with two abreast and good leg room making boarding and exiting quick and easy.

### "a very pleasant experience"
I was very positively surprised on both the ground service in Bogota, with very polite and helpful staff and the in-flight experience and staff. It was my first time flying with Air Europa and I only can say it was a very pleasant experience and I can wholeheartely recommend this airline!

### "very rude and unpleasant"
Quality of customer service is shocking, they are very rude and unpleasant to deal with. Stewardesses had no clue what food they serving or weather it contains meat or not. Quality of food is another shocker, even for airplane standard. In Madrid during bording I was asked by a rude stewardess to show my passport and ticket "documentation". Even though I provided my EU passport they asked for a visa? or UK ID. Hardly any announcements during the flight were in English. I will never use this airline and I will advise everyone not to fly with them.

### "check which type of plane you are booking"
Since we retired, and following illness, my husband and I have always flown Business on long haul flights, specifically for the comfort of having a bed you can get some sleep in. Up until last year we had mainly flown Iberia, satisfactorily, but last year, seeing that Air Europa offered much better value, we decided to try them from Madrid to Miami, and had a wonderful flight on one of their 787 Dreamliners. So this year we booked a Málaga to Cancún return with high expectations. These were not met. Of their Airbus fleet of 12, only 3 have been reconfigured to provide flatbed seats, and it was (probably the oldest) one of the remaining nine that does the Madrid/Cancún route. Going out was ok because Business was fairly empty and we could find a seat that worked, but on the return journey it was completely full. Our seats were, allegedly, 'Lie-Flat' seats (Trade Descriptions Act where are you?). The footrests were broken on both our seats, which meant that only the back of the seat reclined (identical to that of Tourist class). When we mentioned it to the stewardess, she agreed that nothing could be done and pointed out that the majority were broken in this way. A ten hour flight is a very long time to stay awake, with only a choice of about 6 films to entertain you. When we got to Madrid, I couldn't walk at first because my ankles were so swollen, and yet we had to run to make the connecting flight because Air Europa have to park so far away from the hub, with buses at both ends. The moral of this story is check which type of plane you are booking, and if it's a 330-200, don't risk it, you'll just get Tourist amenities at Business prices.

### "my experience was so terribly awful"
I have never written a bad review in my life because frankly I don’t care enough to waste my time and energy on bad experiences but my experience was so terribly awful that today that changes. Trust me when I say do not fly Air Europa unless you want to have a panic attack during connecting flights. I flew from Miami to Madrid with a connecting flight to Barcelona and it was terrible. Both going to Spain and coming back from Spain I couldn’t check into my flight online. The website told me to call customer service or call the number. So I proceeded to call the customer service number as directed thinking they could just send me my boarding pass via email but I was wrong. I had to leave the gates to find the Air Europa check in desk on the other side of the airport (which I almost didn’t find) then I finally got my ticket. Side note, none of their hotline customer service representatives speak proper English. When I finally got my ticket in person I had to run back to the other side of the airport, through customs and to my gate which was the very last gate in the entire airport. I almost missed my flight both times because of their dysfunctional online check in system. Trust me I would have paid the extra $40+ for a Norwegian and/or another discount airliner if I would have known how terrible this airline was. Worst airline ever!

### "never fly Air Europa again"
Havana to London via Madrid. We queued for three hours in the most awful, disorganised queue at Havana airport to check in (we checked in at the time we were supposed to take off) and unfortunately the experience didn’t improve once we boarded the plane. Shortly after take off we heard very strange noises followed by two massive drops where the plane literally felt like it was falling. Passengers were screaming and there was not one message from the pilot or cabin crew to reassure us. We could see some lightning outside and  only assume that the sounds we could hear were hail hitting the plane. As for the drops I have never experienced anything like it and was  terrified. I feel it was awful that there was no announcement from crew to reassure passengers who were clearly very distressed. Other than this there wasn’t enough food served and it was disgusting. If you press the call button no one comes to see if you are okay. I had to go and find cabin crew in the kitchen to ask for water. Will never fly Air Europa again!

### "service was pleasant enough"
Flew Air Europa from Salvador to Madrid via Sao Paulo. So the flight was cheap and I had read all the negative reviews so was prepared for the worst. The first encounter I had was trying to make payment through the call centre due to difficulties with the web page. When I finished the call I said to the operator that if the flight went as smoothly as our call did I will be very happy. It was extremely quick and easy and he even managed to make a saving on my booking! So the flight was nothing special but wasn't horrible. Maybe we had low expectations. We had loaded our computer up with films for our daughter, downloaded a new book to the kindle and packed food for the trip. As to be expected the inflight entertainment was non existent but the food was not that horrible and the service on the flight was pleasant enough. The plane not overly comfortable but at 6 foot 7 not to many planes really are. We had a spare seat next us (didn't know these still existed) on one of the legs so we had some spare room. If I had the choice again for the money we saved we would happily take it.

### "rude stewardesses who can not speak English"
Flew Air Europa from Cancun to Madrid. It has been like traveling by plane in the 60s. Without TVs, with a service of rude stewardesses who can not speak English. I don’t say my English is good, but I suppose if you work on a plane giving information you need to speak good English. The food was horrible, very low quality and no vegetarian option. Do not even think about traveling with this company on transatlantic trips. It has been the worst trip. They did not even have a plug to charge my phone.

### "they are taking zero responsibility"
Flight UX0091 was direct and supposed to land in JFK but instead the flight landed in BOS. We then sat on the runway for 4 hours until we pulled into a gate. When we were unboarded from the plane (at 11pm), no directions were given on what was happening or how we would get to JFK. First they said maybe a bus, then hotels for the night, but none were given to us. We were given "stranded passengers status" by the airport. We had to purchase an expensive hotel room $188 as well as transportation to the hotel $23. The next day we had to purchase 2 train tickets $460 to get home. We were never taken to our final destination by Air Europa and we had to pay $671 extra to get home. I called and they said to file a complaint online and wait 7 days for a response. After 8 days with no response I called back and they said I have to wait 45 days for a response. I'm confused how they stranded me in a different state than my destination, I had to pay $671 to get home, and they are taking zero responsibility. Never flying Air Europa again and I advise you not to either.

### "never travel this airline again"
Horrible experience. I will never travel this airline again. I bought a one way ticket from Gatwick to Madrid. One day before my flight I tried checking in online and for some reason I had a same error. I tried calling customer service and they told me everything is ok with reservation. After several failed attempts I decided to check in at the airport and there they told me I don't have a seat because the flight was overbooked. I had a hand luggage with me and at check-in they told me I also need to put that as a hold luggage. Luckily there was a seat at the gate and I went to Madrid at the end. When I arrived there my luggage was missing and they informed me that it probably stayed at the airport in London because I got the seat at the last moment. There at the airport I filed for a missing luggage and they informed me I as soon as they find it they will call me on my phone number. After calling for days, on the 3. days I called again to check the status and they told me it arrived at the airport and that they will send it the same day to my hostel. It didn't arrive of course and the struggle continued till today, after 6 days when I called again to confirm I will pick it up tomorrow (the day of my return flight) by myself at the airport.

### "I will never take it again"
Air Europa is cheap yes but I will never take it again it is not worth it. 1) Delay, 3 hours delay for Frankfurt to Madrid and arriving in Madrid they told me that I needed to run to be able to take my plane for Miami (the airport of Madrid is horrible). 2) After running to the gate to get my plane, the stewards were not speaking English or it was very bad English for a plane going to Miami. Then they shouted at me to show my paper in Spanish! 3) When I entered the plane after the run I asked for some water and it took one hour to get a little glass of water. I know is a low cost airlines but airlines such as Norwegian provide better comfort (more space), IT (movies etc) and qualified employees that speak English.

### "Great service for the money"
Lisbon to Madrid. I am a regular customer of this route. Iit is not about the newspapers and magazines they offer in a 50 minutes flight but the way they serve the passengers. And the service they do in a short flight, in Business, and they will keep the seats near you empty for your comfort. They serve organic food, salads, good Spanish wine etc. Great service for the money that we pay.

### "hopeless trying to check in online"
❎ Not Verified |  Gatwick to Madrid, and the cabin crew were so rude! In my job, making sarcastic comments to customers is not appropriate, and we don't deal with people who have been waiting around for hours. In terms of the booking experience, the website is quite difficult to navigate, and crashes a lot. The first time I tried to book, it kept crashing at the payment page, so I called customer service. They told me that AMEX is not accepted (when the website says it is), so I booked my flight over the phone, with a different card. However, I received no email confirmation, just reminders from the website to complete my booking or it will be cancelled. So, I called customer service again, and they sent me an email. There is no way of just viewing your booking online to check details: you have to go to add luggage, or pre-book seats, or some other edit. The third time I called customer service was to send me a credit card receipt, or at least the booking details with price on them, as this was missing from the first one. It was hopeless trying to check in online, there is no way of skipping the paid-for seat reservation, and I wasn't fussed, so I couldn't check in online. Checking in at the airport, there were only two desks, and although only a short queue of people, 4/5 at most, each check in took ages. Compare this to other airlines with a smooth online check in and quick bag drop, and it really is behind the times. It took me less time to go through security! And finally, boarding with rude staff, who kept walking up and down the aisle pushing past people who were trying to put luggage overhead as quickly as possible. I was in a window seat, and the two people nearer the aisle were kindly waiting for me to put my bag overhead before stepping out. My little handbag was next to the seat for maybe 5 seconds while I put my bag away (and no-one walking past this far up) but the steward picked it up, shouted 'whose is this', and shoved it at me while I was closing the locker, followed by 'no wonder', as he had already told me I was in the way further down the aisle. Totally needless - he was such a jobsworth. Overall, not an experience I want to repeat, and I won't be flying with them again. It's just not worth the hassle.

### "wonderful and smooth flight"
Miami to Madrid. It it was a wonderful and smooth flight my only complaint could be customer service. At the airport the agents were very pleasant and helpful. They had nice IFE but they didn't have much to watch on them. Do not buy the wifi. They say its 30mb but 30mb of what? Its the amount of data, that will just disappear within a short time. But otherwise I like Air Europa and would fly them again.

### "very unfriendly cabin crew"
Madrid to Tenerife. First, when we checked in online, there web site was not at all clear as to the charge for non carry on luggage. Due to this the price dubbled at checkin from 30€ to 60€ per bag each way! They were not helpful at all at checkin. Our baggage charge was almost the same passage fair. Once on board, there was absolutely nothing offered complementary, not even water. This was a flight over 2.5 hours. Cramped seats and very unfriendly cabin crew. The only thing I found interesting, was there inflight mag goes on and on how they were a high customer service company. Absolutely the worst company I have ever dealt with! !

### "an hour waiting to check in"
Manchester to Palma de Mallorca. The flights were punctual and reasonably comfortable. However, having arrived at the airport at 8am for a 10.10 flight, we first spent an hour waiting to check in, despite having already selected our seats on-line. My partner has a back problem and standing in a queue for all that time caused him severe discomfort. On our return journey we again queued for 50 minutes. The problem, as far as we could see, was caused by computer problems and harassed ground staff. Why cannot Air Europa provide an on-line check-in facility as other airlines do?

### "delayed by 3 hours"
Lisbon to Barcelona via Madrid, my advanced flight was delayed by 3 hours and was notified 5 minutes after the proper boarding time. A significant delay should be notified early. The airline only provides lunch compensation, while without any lunch compensation I have access to the lounge, so the compensation is not paying a disappointment. Baggage handling is also very slow, even my luggage comes out last, albeit with Baggage Priority label.

### "improve baggage handling"
Rome to Lisbon via Madrid. The flight was nice, but with lots of delay for those two flight FCO-MAD and MAD-LIS. Air Europa does't provide Fragile Tag Label, and finally my baggage was broken when I arrive in Lisbon, and there's no staff in Baggage Collection Area. Air Europa has to improve baggage handling service.

### "Air Europa is a scam of an airline"
Air Europa is known for its horrible customer service, but as customer service is that hard to reach, its actually a scam! They intentionally avoid contact with customers this way. I paid extra from Lima as I was promissed to "skip the lines" and advance directly to Bag drop. No bag drop was available so instead of getting breakfast, I spent a total of 2 hours in lines as the ground staff were incompetent and slow. As I transfered to my conecting flight my bags did not. As I continued to Vietnam, my bags arrived 3 days later and instead of being delivered to my home, I was required to take a 60 minute cab ride to and from the airport to pick up my bag. On my return trip I arrived 3 hours before the departure time and 90 minutes before no staff member is present. There is no number to call, no way to contact anyone! Air Europa is a scam of an airline!

### "not recommend this airline"
Vigo to Bilbao via Madrid. Flights delayed 4 times no explanations. Poor stressed staff who appear resigned to this sort of thing occurring regularly. They bear the brunt of a poorly run airline. Spent all day at Madrid airport with continual delays. Would not recommend this airline at all.

### "cabin crew were well presented and pleasant"
I flew with Air Europa from London Gatwick to Madrid for the first time. I found the website logical and well planned. Check-in was quick and pleasant and although there was a delay in departure this was managed well. The cabin crew were well presented and pleasant and served snacks and drinks one could buy. Drop down screens played some items related to Madrid and I have to say I found the seats very comfortable. Information was clear and connecting passengers were provided with good details by the crew. I would gladly travel with this company again!

### "disappointed about the food"
Buenos Aires to Barcelona via Madrid. I'm writing this review because I'm disappointed about the food I haven't received on my flight from Buenos Aires to Barcelona. Taking a 12 hours flight with only one main meal is not expected by anyone I believe. Ashamed and hungry I went asking for food to the Flight attendants, so they access to gave me 4 small sandwiches with nearly nothing inside. In the same moment when they gave those sandwiches they told me that the food was coming in 10 minutes. I took more than one hour and for my surprise was another sandwich!

### "never fly them again"
Brussels to New York via Madrid. Although the bad reviews I thought I should give it a try due to their low prices, but I should have known better. Flights were ok, food and drinks as well, flight attendants were nice as well but customer service one big chaos, no communication at all, very rude and unpolite staff. We had a delay of 24 hours in Madrid and they were like ´yes, it happens, here you have a complaint form, next please´ and didn´t have any compassion at all, no help, no reaction on email, telephone or complaint forms, Nothing! Finally after 24 hours next flight to JFK (New York) were we found out they lost all our Luggage! Made report at lost and found, went to swissport which did the handling but nothing found. We had to call to the number on the report and if the bags would be found they should send them over by Fedex, everyday we called to JFK, we called to Madrid, even the hotel-staff called for us, nobody knows where the bags are, we can´t help you is their standard answer. We had to buy all things new as we didn´t have anything, not even underwear or piece of soap. Now back home, called multiple times, to New York and Madrid as well, they don´t know where the bags are, and they can´t find them in Worldtracer as well. Terrible, never fly them again. Also no onboard entertainment on a 8h flight, only some general screens in the middle which half of them didn´t work and only in Spanish.

### "terrible organization at check-in"
Terrible organization at Air Europa check-in for my flight from Barcelona to Madrid. I arrived at check-in two hours before the scheduled departure time, finding myself at the end of a very long, snaking queue full of families with large amounts of luggage. There were no Air Europa staff directing people to the self-check-in machines, which were invisible as they were hidden behind another queue of people. After standing one hour in that slow-moving queue I caught a glimpse of the machines which finally appeared. The machines are efficient and it took me less than five minutes to get my boarding pass (I didn't have any luggage). By the time I got through security and found the gate, boarding was already underway. It's quite likely I would have missed the flight or had to make a very stressful dash for the gate had I stayed in that queue - there was at least another half an hour or more before reaching the counter. The flight itself was fine. We were bussed to the plane, a spacious and clean 787 which shook and rattled for much of the journey. WiFi was available, as was entertainment on personal screens including maps. The seats are quite comfortable with reasonable legroom - certainly no complaints for a 1 hour flight. They made an attempt with a buy-on-board service but the flight is so short and the plane so large that they didn't reach where I was seated. A strong point is that cabin staff were numerous and visible, they double and even triple checked seat belts and other security regulations. Early arrival in Madrid.

### "very good flight attendants"
Barcelona to São Paulo via Madrid with Air Europa. Very good flight attendants. I was not expecting too much for this flight, and I was really pleased to see such a good seats - however, it is missing storage to keep items during the flight. Food wasn't at the level of a business, but it is not an issue, during the stop, we enjoyed the very good lounge.

### "some of the friendliest crew"
Flew Air Europa from Madrid to New York JFK. The cabin crew were some of the friendliest crew I have come across. They went out of their way with a smile, patience and humor. I had a personal health issue and had to exit the aircraft asap upon landing and they completely understood and offered to get me assistance upon exiting the aircraft. Couldn't have been nicer.

### "Very good service"
Lisbon to Madrid. Very good service for a short flight. 50 Minutes with an amazing service for Business and great food. Good service on board also vs competition. Seat also with great space in the first row. Magazines and newspapers (not available in TAP for example).

### "price is affordable"
Madrid to Guayaquil. Good service - they have a good service in Business class. WIFI works badly. Food is great they have even this Detox juices. Old seats, don't expect in this route to go flat. But price is affordable. Old TV, and the programs can be dramatically better.

### "delayed more than 5 hours"
On 8/5/2017 I flew with Air Europa from Amsterdam with final destination Guayaquil. At Madrid airport we were delayed more than 5 hours because they hadn't arranged a plane for the scheduled flight. To begin with, there was no personnel responsible for informing us of the long delay. It was not enough that we were left waiting for about 5 hours without any official explanation from the company, but the personnel were incredibly rude with all the passengers. Instead of reassuring and calming us they were provocative and offensive against passengers.

### "very poor customer service"
UX flights Paris Orly to Madrid and Madrid to Alicante. The first flight from ORY to MAD was late. Eventually I arrived to MAD at 13:50, and boarding for the next flight to ALC was scheduled for 14:05. On board of my flight to Madrid nobody could give me any information about my connection, even about the gate number. Upon my arrival in MAD it turned out that the next flight to ALC disappeared from the screens. At the UX transfer desk (poorly marked) a very relaxed staff member told me the flight to ALC was 'on hold' and that she had no clue if it would eventually take place. I went to the lounge (I am a gold AF member) and around 14:50 I was told the flight was about to board. No extra explanations, just an arrogant 'hurry up'. In sum, even though UX is a SkyTeam member, its service is way worse than on Transavia and way worse than on KL or AF. I was on AirEuropa flights for a number of times, mostly on intra-EU flights. UX is a no-frills airline with a very poor customer service.

### "completely unprepared for this"
Our flight from Lima to Madrid, which was scheduled to take off at 1020 am, was delayed 19 hours, presumably because of a mechanical problem (weather was fine). The plane actually took off about 45 minutes late, and circled around for about 45 minutes before landing again. We waited for an hour or so at the gate and then until 5pm at a different gate. Part of this process was getting another passport stamp to indicate that we never left Peru. Some passengers (there were not enough for all) were served sandwiches and drinks. At 5 pm we were taken by bus to get our checked bags. We were not informed about what to do after that. In answer to our questions near the check-in desk, we were told to wait in a huge line, which at present looks like it will take about 2 to 3 hours. This is for hotel and food vouchers, which we might have by 8 pm. We will then be bused to a hotel, and will need to be back in the airport by 2am, to catch a plane by 5am at the earliest. At no time were we fully informed of the situation with the plane or our arrangements, or any plan. While the airline personnel did try and were friendly enough, they were always overwhelmed. It's as though the airline was completely unprepared for this, and as if passenger comfort and time is of absolutely no importance.

### "not a pleasant experience"
Madrid to Cancun. Air France couldn't fly me to the connecting flight from Paris to Cancun so they flew me to Madrid saying that my connection to Cancun will be operated by AeroMexico. This flight was however operated by Air Europa. My worst flight and not a pleasant experience. The lunch was nice though but the ground staff is unorganized, the flight attendants were confused, there are no screens on Economy seats. The WiFi is nice and you can catch only two television shows on your personal tablet/phone (which is counted as in-flight entertainment). If you run out of battery then you're out of luck. The cockpit announcements in English were barely audible. Leg space is awful. Besides, they "forgot" to put my bag on the plane and it was stuck in Madrid for two days. The Air Europa representative at Cancun was very helpful though who made sure that I received my bag at my local address in Mexico. The plane itself seemed old. I would never fly with this carrier ever again. Only good things are WiFi on-board and the nice lunch they served.

### "extremely unhelpful"
Yesterday we flew with Air Europa from Madrid to Palma Mallorca. I was travelling with 3 kids (one baby of 4 months) and 2 adults. People from Air Europa on the ground were extremely unhelpful. It is amazing that they don’t allow priority boarding when you are travelling with small kids and fully loaded with luggage. In addition to this, they were quite rude when explaining things! I guess they didn’t realize that the flight was delayed (as almost every time I have flown with this airline). It was a short period trip so I was carrying all the luggage of my family. No one from the crew helped me out with it (they didn’t even offer). It was my 4 year daughter that was the one who had to help me as I could not carry the luggage inside the aircraft (through the corridor). After this “great” experience, I will do my best to avoid travelling with Air Europa ever again and I strongly recommend not doing so to other customers.

### "worst transatlantic experience"
Madrid to New York JFK on 19th March. There were no seat-back IFEs as stated on the web. only fold down LCDs every few rows that played mostly UX ads. Unacceptable in 2017. Aircraft was extremely worn and my headrest kept falling off. Food was terrible quality. Actually served saltines, pasta with red sauce. However I thought the seats had ample recline and since they were so old they had the quality and comfort of a well worn couch. I would say it's like flying Southwest transatlantic. Easily the worst transatlantic experience I have ever had the displeasure. Will be staying away from Air Europa in the future.

### "never choose this airline again"
I had booked a flight with Air Europa from Malaga to Paris in October and I was denied boarding at the airport. I had previously tried to check in online but it was not possible. After being denied boarding I was offered a flight which would give me a sleep over in Barcelona and it would make me 24hrs delayed to Paris. I was also offered 250 Euros as compensation. I never got any money from the airline and after being in contact with customer service multiple times they tell me there is nothing they can do. I find the service insanely bad and I will never choose this airline again.

### "I was pleasantly surprised"
I was pleasantly surprised by this flight experience with Air Europa business class. From Barcelona to Madrid and then to São Paulo, both flights were on time. On the long haul, the plane seem quite new. As soon as I got in, the flight attendant offered me the option to move to a more quiet seat on the cabin (next to the window with no one on the adjacent seat). The dinner was good, so was the wine selection. The movie selection was short but some of this year's Oscar nominees were available. And most importantly: the seat reclined to a completely horizontal flat bed, so I slept around 8 hours. A couple of details to be improved: there was no actual priority boarding on the ground, and they didn't provide a bottled water after dinner (I'm sure they would have done by request though).

### "all four flights delayed"
Palma de Mallorca to Barcelona. I've flown with Air Europa four times this week, and all four flights have been 2-2.5 hours delayed. They offer no water or explanation. Air Europa might be cheap but with a total of 9 hours wasted in one week, it's all of a sudden not so economical to fly with Air Europa.

### "quite happy with our service"
London Gatwick to Havana return via Madrid. Having seen a few very negative reviews on here, I anticipated my trip with some trepidation, however I needn't have been worried. On both outward and return my wife and I experienced a good level of service from the air crews, who were polite and friendly. The Gatwick to Madrid service was like anything I have experienced with Easyjet/Norwegian, quite straightforward. No issues with boarding. On the outward journey we were an hour late taking off despite boarding in good time, this was apparently due to the amounty of luggage being loaded on (having seen what was being checked in for the pre-Christmas flight I could believe that) however we had no issue with the transfer at Madrid. We had an A330 for the Cuban leg, and I have seen comments about the quality of this plane on this site, but our planes both ways were in very good condition, no problems with toilets etc, other than the flight entertainment screens which were a bit past their best. Legroom was OK, nothing special, I'm 6 foot and found it comfortable enough to get some sleep. Food outward bound to Cuba was not bad (I had the beef option rather than risk the pasta! ), food on the way back was a little dried up (probably travelled all the way from Madrid) but we got served champagne on the way home as it was New Years Eve, and the morning bacon roll hit the spot, it would have been nice to have milk not powdered creamer for our drinks, but not exactly a deal breaker!. On our flight home from Cuba the crew had to deal with a passenger who passed out walking down the aisle, which they did quite competently. A lot of the poor comments on this site seem to stem from lost luggage and the response, or missed flights, but we had no problems with our hold luggage so can't comment. Overall quite happy with our service, and felt it was good value for money, would happily use Air Europa again

### "came prepared with my own food"
Gatwick to Havana return via Madrid. Happily myself and my luggage got to the destination (HAV) and the return to LGW together which is the main aim. Three flights of 4 late, the good thing was, as all flights were with Air Europa, the link was there both for me and my luggage. On both LGW - MAD and return flights there were just 2 loos at the rear of the plane for all passengers, except the 12 who were in Business class on the journey out, it was empty on return - still could not use loos. Went to loo, got stuck behind trolleys, made 2 new friends and went to loo twice as was stuck for so long. Staff made no attempt to recognise the issue. Poor service and food on Madrid to Havana flight out. I asked for milk with my tea and was told I could only have powdered creamer as 'milk was a security threat / risk'. Not sure how the other liquid beverages get through? Pizza had ham on it, the steward was insisting it was 'turkey'. Return Havana to Madrid flight the cheese pasta was gross, again no veggie option for the snack - hot ham roll. For such long flights I came prepared with my own food, water and entertainment, I would highly recommend all others follow suit.

### "had no PTV screen display"
San Juan to Barcelona via Madrid. I had to pay 150€ to check in my sports equipment and found it damaged when collecting it at the arrival. They don't accept any responsibility and are not helpful at all. The airplane was old and had no PTV screen display on the seats. Food is awful and the staff were not happy or  polite. I do not recommend this airline. Next time I will pay a bit more for another company.

### "not offering any service"
Milan to Bogota via Madrid. It is now the 4th day since arriving and Air Europa still hasn't been able to deliver my bags. For the last 2 days their call center says that someone will contact me to coordinate delivery but nothing. They are also unable to provide contact number of someone that would be able to help. According to their lost bag website, the bags are at the airport since yesterday. Local office in Bogota does not speak English, and there is no staff at the airport until 3pm. Losing a bag can happen but not offering any service when it happens is absolutely useless.

### "highly unhappy with service"
Lima to Frankfurt via Madrid with Air Europa. Highly unhappy with the service. Flight was delayed 1.40h, however we still made it to get our connecting flight, but Air Europa cancelled already our tickets and booked us in the next flight without letting us know. It was Christmas and I haven't been home for 3 years so this was really important to me. Then on top, they lost our luggage. After calling several times they couldn't find it because it was nowhere checked in. The next day they called and we could pick it up. One bag, declared as fragile, was totally destroyed, the contents inside completely broken. Bad, or non existent customer service, no information during the whole time.

### "such an unprofessional event"
On October 12th I was supposed to be flying from Miami to Palma de Majorca; however 2 days before that; I got into a severe car accident that left me injured. I informed Air Europa of my situation and provided them with the necessary medical documentation. They replied to me by email saying that I would be allow to complete the trip within 45 days from the traveling day. The next day I called again and asked if it would be possible to fly later than the given 45 days due to my injuries. He informed me that it would be possible, that the ticket was good for 1 year but I would have to pay $225 penalty fee, I said that was fine. Since I did not have an specific time for the traveling I said I would call back when I did. When I did call back to make the bookings I spoke with a rude agent who just kept telling me that in my email they had said that I had 45 days to complete the fly. I explained to her many times, that yes it said that in the email but that however, I had been told on the phone that the fly could be completed in 1 year if I pay the penalty fee. I asked to speak to a supervisor she said she will not transfer me to a supervisor because she was the person in charge handling this phone call and that the supervisor would not be able to help me and would only tell me the same thing she told. I have never experienced such an unprofessional event with any airline.

### "I do not recommend"
Amsterdam to Santo Domingo via Madrid with Air Europa. Our flight from Amsterdam was 2.5 hours late. On arrival into Madrid our connection flight had gone and nobody was there to assist. Told to go to the Air Europa customer service desk - only 2 staff working and 200-300 people waiting. It took almost 8-hours of waiting before it was our turn to got some information - a terrible situation. Next flight 2 days later, so we lost 2 days of our holiday in Santo Domingo. I do not recommend.

### "terrible food/drinks service"
Buenos Aires to Madrid. This review concerns to the terrible food/drinks service provided during a flight from Buenos Aires to Madrid. The first meal (lunch) was served at 2:30pm. The next meal was served at 8pm - 5 hours and 30 minutes later, this meal was only composed by a tiny bread with a slice of cheese and a drink to be chosen (only 1 glass, even if in the past 5 hours no drinks were served to the passengers). When I asked to the flight attendants if bread was supposed to be the dinner, they informed me that that was only a snack, and that the dinner would be served two hours before the landing. I asked for a glass of water twice, by using the button to ask for the flight attendant. Both times, the flight attendants told me that they would bring me the glass of water. Both times, the glass never came, and after 30 minutes waiting, I had to recall the flight attendant, or go the back of the airplane myself. When they finally served the dinner, this was bread with cheese/ham, a glass of something to drink, and a piece of cake.

### "most terrible boarding"
Gatwick to Madrid with Air Europa. The most terrible boarding of a plane that I ever had. Poor customer services and the lack of the attention to helping customer. The crew was disorganized giving bad instructions to passengers. I will not recommend to fly with Air Europa. In fact I fly many times due to my work and I had never bad experience like this.

### "rank Air Europa among the worst"
Amsterdam to Madrid with Air Europa. Ground staff ordered to hand in trolley hand luggage. When I walked into the plane, overhead lockers were empty. No explanations given. Then, 10 minutes later, passengers came in with two pieces of hand luggage. Cabin crew blamed KLM ground staff; KLM staff did not bother to answer questions. I have never experienced such a patronizing attitude. I would rank Air Europa among the worst service wise. Not enough to have last generation planes.

### "food was again awful"
Barcelona to New York JFK via Madrid. On the flight from Barcelona to Madrid there was an hour delay and we were just sitting on the plane no explanation or whatsoever, when asked for water they said it's not free and I must wait until take off. Flight from Madrid to JFK was announced with a two hour delay and no explanation then boarded the plane and waited another hour. No individual screens for movies, on the Madrid to JFK flight thy served awful food - they had nuts and chocolate bars that of course you have to pay for. Then their credit card machine was not working so they had to write down the credit card info to charge us later on. The aircraft was old and poorly maintained. On the return flight from JFK to Madrid there were individual screens for movies but they only had 8 movies in total! The food was again awful. The price ticket was cheap but for a small difference you can fly with a better more confortable airlines.

### "the food was very bad "
This was my first trip with Air Europa, to Madrid and back to Tel Aviv. On the first flight they were extremely late, and hour and 15 minutes late to land and load the passengers for the next flight. The food was very bad in both flights. The staff were nice but very limited with their ability to help, as due to the late departure I was about to be late for my next flight. On my way back the entertainment system didn't work for me and for many other passengers. On my first flight there wasn't any entertainment system at all.

### "a nice experience for long haul"
Madrid to New York JFK, on a busy afternoon flight with Air Europa. Check in fast and easy at the terminal. Flight boarded on time by row numbers. Pleasantly suprised by the confort of the seat for economy. Standard seat pitch. FA's very nice during all fligth. Interacting with passangers and always with a smile. Flight departed and arrived on time. Meals nice, standard for economy too. Individual screens for movies. Very limited choice but all new movies and ok for a 7hr fligth. Bags short on belt after arrival at terminal 4 with no line for inmigration. A nice experience for long haul.

### "flight itself was quite cheap"
I flew from Frankfurt to Gran Canaria via Madrid. The flights were on time, but Check In in FRA was very crowded, so I would recomend the online-check in, because that counter wasn't crowded. FRA wasn't so crowded in general and boarding went fine. They didn't serve us any food or drinks for free but the flight itself was quite cheap, so that's normal I think. Transfer in Madrid was quite short and the terminal was very crowded. In LPA the baggage drop of was very fast and all in all everything went fine and was OK (seats, friendlyness of crew, etc.) Despite that, it was very cold on board, but there were monitores showing the position of the aircraft.

### "the flight was cancelled"
I booked a round trip flight with Air Europa From London to San Juan (Puerto Rico) via Madrid, upon my return they hired Seaborne to take me to Santo Domingo so I could catch my way back with Air Europa, However, my Seaborne Flight got cancelled. Once I checked in and passed security control and after an hour or so of waiting I learned the flight was cancelled, they didn’t really specify the reason for the cancellation but their supervisor commented it might have been due to other flights being very late and their pilots going over their hours. After a 3-hour wait Seaborne sent me to a Marriott hotel, I had to pay for the transportation to and from the hotel which, after an hour and a half of fighting the counter staff they reimbursed me, as well as the US$25.00 I paid the day before. Since Air Europa has no office in San Juan, I was in constant contact with Seaborne’s supervisor at the airport he assured me in writing my flight was re-booked for the following day (19th June 2016), which happened to be the same flight in which my family was returning to Spain. I arrived to the counter more than 3 hours earlier from my scheduled flight, just to find that the flight failed to be booked, I dealt with two members of staff from the counter who said there was nothing they could do. They passed the situation to their supervisor who blamed Seaborne for not booking the air tickets. I explained to her that I originally booked my flight with Air Europa and I wanted Air Europa to resolve the situation for me. They only told me they could do nothing for me and referred me to Seaborne. Seaborne was overwhelmed with more flight cancellations (apparently this is the normal situation within that company) and failed to book me in the flight. After going back to Air Europa the Supervisor “explained” to us with a sarcastic smile that she could not do anything because “that’s how alliances work” and I should deal with Seaborne and the situation myself. They offered me a “solution”, they said I could buy the flight and then claim the money back, I found the situation unbelievable but I realised that could be a solution so I asked for the price; I was told the price would cost me US$5,500.00 which I refused as I do not have such amount of money available, she then said, once again, there was nothing she could do. Finally my family had to leave me amongst tears and frustration and I was left alone in the airport with both Seaborne and Air Europa counters empty. As per my mother’s words there was enough space in the plane so that many people spent the flight sleeping laying down across 4 seats, and that is not counting spaces between people and in the 2-seat rows. Around 23:00, after dealing with them over the phone they sent me to the Double Tree by Hilton in Isla Verde in a shared taxi. At any point during this day I was offered Lunch or Dinner. This is when I started getting angry and tweeting the situation mentioning both companies. On the morning I went on the phone with customer services in both companies. Both companies have an awful customer service helpline and they kept me referring to each other’s telephone. In the end I spend around 3 hours in the phone trying to resolve the problem. I strongly believe this work should have been done for me as I was in no blame.

### "worst airline I have ever flown"
Amsterdam to Santo Domingo via Madrid. Air Europa is by far the worst airline I have ever flown. They were significantly late both ways (once even 7 hours) and lost my luggage. Now, when that happens and the airline takes care of you I won't be the guy to write a bad review. But, unfortuantely, they did the opposite. There was no compensation, no help, no customer service, nothing. In fact they made me post a million and one things to claim back my lost luggage to then never reply to me. Simply ignoring all e-mails. I have never experienced something so bad.

### "did not have a good experience"
London Gatwick to Sao Paulo via Madrid return. We did not have a good experience with Air Europa. Some of the problems we experienced included long delays at Madrid, with no good communication between the airline and the customers. Cabin crew in general not attentive. You have to pay 3 euros for head phones,  the plane we flew (from Madrid to Guarulhos, 11 hours flight) had no individual screens for the in flight entertainment options. Despite requesting a gluten-free meal, I was only given the gluten-free option on the return flight. In general, customer service was not very good. On the return flight, I purchased Internet connectivity. If you fly Air Europa, do not bother - it really does not work, and you will just waste 7 euros. We will not fly again with Air Europa.

### "definitely use this airline again"
Booked a flight London to Miami return via Madrid. Flight there was surprisingly good as I had read the reviews and expected the worst! Food wasn't particular bad - just stay away from overcooked pasta. Seats were not as bad as expected. Although ground staff could have been more organised boarding passengers on the plane. Both occasions boarding time was delayed. Then one of the staff had to shout out for Priority and families with children to board first through all the chaos. I would suggest that toilets be checked more often and tissues replenished. Both my kids were sick upon landing in Madrid after 7 hour flight and cabin crew were very helpful and kind. Overall I would definitely use this airline again.

### "forget about comfort and service"
Buenos Aires to London via Madrid. One of worst flights of my life. My seat has the entertainment system not working at all (13 hours flight). During take off my seat (51A) started to recline in sleeping mode. I am not a light person (85 Kg) but this is a serious issue. The quality of the food was terrible. Alcoholic beverage were not available after the first round of food (but you had the possibility to buy a good variety of beverage on board). The flight attendants were polite but not very friendly. I would say that if you are looking just to go from A to B, and there is no other options, is ok. But you have to forget about comfort and good service. Anyway the safety issue on my seat is serious and I would suggest the company to solve it before the aircraft will be grounded after a safety inspection.

### "cabin crew were quite unfriendly"
I flew with Air Europa on holiday to Cuba and on the way there there was no delay, the meal was very good and the cabin crew were nice so that was a very good experience and it was my first time flying long haul. The way back was different. Our flight to Madrid was delayed three hours but that was due to bad weather. Our evening meal we got was terrible. I slept reasonably well and the breakfast was ok. The cabin crew were quite unfriendly. We arrived in Madrid when our connection was leaving and they very kindly held the flight so we could get on. We returned to London Gatwick with no problem and our baggage was there.

### "overall satisfied with my experience"
Bogotá to Amsterdam via Madrid. I'm very satisfied with my Air Europa flight. The first aircraft was big, clean and modern. It was an almost 10 hour flight, so comfort is everything. There was a good selection of entertainment. Dinner was good, breakfast was okay. Flight attendants were polite. I got the tickets at half the price of what other companies expected. Unfortunately the flight was a little delayed and I almost missed my second connection in Madrid. Besides that I'm overall satisfied with my first Air Europa experience and would choose to fly them again.

### "you would expect some kind of service"
After reading reviews I thought, could it be that bad for just a short European flight? Well, I regret ever spending my well-collected miles for a flight with them. Number one problem? Communication. Departing from Amsterdam with a delay a little less than 1 hour (which is doable) because of what? We will never know. No apologies were given. The good thing is that Amsterdam airport has a good mobile app and provides a lot of information so you always know upfront that your flight is delayed and gives opportunities to adjust plans. All set, finally in the plane. After a while you would expect some kind of service, maybe a drink, a small bite. Well, this is not to be expected with Air Europa. I know it was a 'short' flight but KLM for example always offers a drink, sandwich and a muffin. I ended up paying for a can of sparkling water plus potato chips which then was being charged as separate items since the crew don't remember the package deals. After a calm flight we arrived at Madrid airport, too late of course and I had just about 30 minutes to change gates. Once at the correct gate, everybody was already in line since boarding was about to start at that hour. Nothing happened for 2 hours. No announcement, no information, nothing. Finally the boarding started after 1 crew member was being dropped off by a bus just 10 minutes before, making it look like we were all waiting 2 hours for this lady to arrive. Once in the plane, the captain actually spoke to us and informed us they were having a technical error which has been fully resolved now and we could fly safely to Barcelona. OK, all good, so why were we still stuck with toilets closed, inside the plane for another hour? Everybody was hot, thirsty, in need of a pee etc, passengers were getting angry. During take-off the pilot flew straight into a thunderstorm, the turbulence wasn't very helpful. Traffic control 'forgot' to change the route? Once in the air, again no gestures.

### "food was not very pleasant"
London to Sao Paulo via Madrid with Air Europa. Flights delayed both at Gatwick and Madrid - in Madrid no information was provided for the reason. Once on board (1 hour late) the service was good but the seat was very uncomfortable and the food was not very pleasant. The inflight staff were attentive but unable to explain the delays. The cabin and washrooms were quite dirty - I found a half eaten packet of nuts down the side of my seat. The menu was basic with various forms of salad provided, the best meal was breakfast and even that had salad with it. Good selection of films but an older IFE system with smaller screens which were fixed to the seat in front.

### "was pleasantly surprised"
London to Miami via Madrid. I was prepared for all case scenarios - pay for food onboard, small cramped seats, old toilets, missed connecting flight, long delays and lost luggages. However was pleasantly surprised - flights were on time, seats were actually comfy. Food wasn't horribly bad and you didn't have to pay for it. However either you brought your own headphones or had to buy cheap headphones. Toilets were clean - you weren't provided an overnight case (I wasnt expecting it). Flights left on time and no delays. I was travelling with 2 small boys and it went very smoothly. Staff onboard were very friendly and kind. In fact I saw an air steward collecting a sick bag and then going up and down offering sick bags as we were circling for about an hour before landing. Air stewards and stewardess were very professional, kind and friendly.

### "flight crew were friendly"
Overall pleasant flight with Air Europa from London Gatwick to Madrid Barajas with a small delay at the beginning. Once arrived to Madrid, we waited 2 hours for our luggage, but I think this is the airports responsibility. The flight crew were friendly, I would say not much more then average. I want to warn anybody willing to fly with this airline that you need to pay an extra €15 fee for luggage under about 20kg.

### "I was very pleasantly surprised"
I flew from Miami to Rome via Madrid and then back 1 month later. My experience with Air Europa was nothing but pleasant, even with the small delays I suffered on the way there (one of which was the fault of the airplane using the gate before us in Madrid, not AE). The plane for the overseas flight seemed almost brand new with decent in-flight food, awesome entertainment, the flight attendants were great and professional, despite a language barrier (I speak very little Spanish). The Madrid to Rome plane was older and not as nice, but the flight was still just fine. I scored a very cheap ticket for this trip, which set my expectations low, and I was very pleasantly surprised. I would definitely fly Air Europa again.

### "never had such terrible flight"
São Paulo to Madrid to Lisbon. I've never had such terrible flight experience. The plane was dirty, my seat had a greasy face print at the window and the chairs had a strange smell, and there was no PTV. I tried to remember the last time I took a 10 hour international flight with no individual tvs or entertaining, may be 20 years ago! When I tried to connect the headphones (my own, cause you had to buy theirs for 3 euros!) the sound didn't work. The lunch tasted disgusting and badly cooked. I am a vegetarian so I asked for the pasta: a block of pasta with really sour tomato sauce and cheese. At least they served good Spanish wine (but after 3 hours of flight it was over) breakfast was something else, the old cold sandwich had cheese wrapped in ham, which made it impossible for a veggie to eat it.

### "was a very pleasant experience"
Brussels to Bogota via Madrid and back to Amsterdam with Air Europa four weeks later. It was a very pleasant experience. Crew was very friendly and the Boeing 787 a very pleasant plane to fly. The first flight from Brussels was on a smaller Embraer, which was equally pleasant. Only the last flight from Madrid to Amsterdam was in an old A330. I had read a lot of negative reviews but these proved untrue for me. I would certainly fly this airline again.

### "avoid this airline at all cost"
New York to Ibiza via Madrid. Air Europa is the worst airline I've ever experienced. Starting with a 2,5h delay out of New York, finally departing 30m past midnight we were still barely on time to make our connecting flight - but they just rebooked us to a later flight in Madrid giving us a 6 hour layover even though we made it to the gate of our original flight from Madrid to Ibiza. Could we board it? No, it was full. They had sold our seats and rebooked us to a late flight without asking. And yes, the late flight from Madrid to Ibiza was also delayed. Everything from customer service to the quality of the business cabin is extremely poor. I will avoid this airline at all cost.

### "overall had a very pleasant flight"
I✅ Verified Review | Just flew with Air Europa to Bogota from London via Madrid and overall had a very pleasant flight. Our flight was indeed delayed (like all the reviews seem to suggest) by about an hour, and with a connection time of one hour 25 minutes I was convinced we were going to miss our connecting flight. However the flight attendants reassured us that there were many people taking the same connection as us and that the second flight would wait for us, and also that our baggage would be automatically transferred so all we had to do was walk to the next gate. The connecting flight was also delayed (fortunately) so we were in no danger at all of missing it. We ended up arriving to Bogota only about 30 minutes later than scheduled and the baggage came through quickly without any problems. The flights themselves were perfectly pleasant. The London to Madrid aircraft was a bit shabbier - for example my entertainment screen didn't work, but then I hadn't been expecting one anyway so that was fine. But there was nothing major wrong with anything. The second leg to Bogota was one of the best flights I've been on. Admittedly this was the first transatlantic flight I'd been on, and I had very low expectations from the reviews, but I was very, very pleased. The interior seemed very new and the entertainment screens were far slicker than the ones on the first flight, and with a good selection of movies and tv etc. We were given blankets and pillows (again, not much for standard airlines but for such a budget one I hadn't expected anything for free at all). We also got free soft drinks throughout (I got one free glass of wine and I overheard people being told on later rounds that it was now one euro per glass after the free one), one main meal and then another sandwich later on. Again, much more for free than I had expected. My only complaint about the whole flight was the vegetarian meal - just one slab of plain tofu on some tomato sauce with roasted veg. The veg was delicious but the tofu was so bland, and there was no carbohydrate replacement (both vegetarian and meat meals got a bread roll, but the meat meal also had a carb component in the main meal). I also got fruit instead of a cake for dessert (I realise this is because the vegetarian meal was also suitable for vegans) which was a nice refreshing change on a flight, but it left me hungry because I had also missed out on carbs with the main. The vegetarian sandwich later on was filled with Spanish potato tortilla which was really tasty. I had come on this flight with the lowest of low expectations, but even if I hadn't read these reviews beforehand I think I would still have been very happy with the service I received. Obviously I got lucky by not missing my connection or having my luggage lost like so many others, but I want to provide a balanced view to those experiences so that people who have just bought a flight with Air Europa don't panic as much as I did.

### "what an unmitigated disaster"
I now see I should have read the reviews on this site before spending money on our holiday trip to Havana : what an unmitigated disaster this airline is! Amsterdam to Madrid left an hour and a half late, nearly cancelling out our transfer time for the onward leg to Havana. At MAD we were told to go to Customer Service to get our flight rebooked and vouchers for a hotel. Unfindable office, no-one speaks a word of English, hordes of angry customers arguing at length with two overworked reps. Return: Same story but 4 times worse: arriving at airport three hours before departure, we are told that the flight is delayed. It ends up being more than six hours late. The complimentary meals had run out (275 stranded passengers missing dinner) seats were ridiculously uncomfortable so no sleep. Replacement aircraft was a A330-200 instead of the regular A330-300, so broken seats, no legroom, disgusting food. Entartainment system was 'down" but they have WiFi. (at a laughable cost, yes). Maybe indicative that the captain announced that he was proud of his passengers for not misbehaving.

### "service from crewmembers anticipatory and courteous"
Miami to Barcelona via Madrid with Air Europa. Business class on the new 787. Continued on to BCN. Nothing but wonderful things to say about the inflight services, however, nothing but bad to say about airport and reservations services. At all but one ground staff encounter in all 3 cities, employees are unfriendly to the point of being rude and seem either untrained or just incompetent. BCN Business Class check-in agent did not even greet me as I approached, instead waited for me to speak. He then opened my reservation and just stared at the screen until I prompted him as to what he was doing (“Just looking,” he said.) Sky Priority is not respected at any point in any airport. Reservations agents are hit-and-miss - some try to help, others referred us to Delta because “Delta sold the tickets.” Inflight, however, is a completely different experience. Cabin crews are exceptional, with a sophisticated, professional, warm style of service. There was always a flight attendant either in the cabin or walking through, and all were, without exception, friendly and willing to oblige as best as they could. Outbound, the gentleman serving our aisle ensured little things, like nearly empty glasses, were filled as soon as he spotted them. On the return MAD-MIA flight the flight attendant working our aisle was probably the hardest working F/A I have ever seen. Nothing was an inconvenience to her, everything was served with a smile and true graciousness. She even offered to bag our shoes and put them in the overhead so we could have even more foot room. Service from all crewmembers was anticipatory and courteous versus ground staff who apparently see passengers as an inconvenience.

### "riot created at the gate"
I flew Air Europa from Valencia to Sao Paulo via Madrid. Upon arrival in Madrid at around 9.30 pm, flight to Sao Paulo was scheduled for 11.15 pm. We are notified that the aircraft would be late, no reason given. There was a bit of a riot being created at the gate with an exchange of nasty words between passengers and Air Europa employees. Finally, due to pressure from passengers, close to 1 am, they tell us departure will be 7.00 am. The airline refuses to provide hotel accommodation, instead they send the 300+ passengers to a shared airline lounge. When the 300+ passengers arrive at the lounge, there was only one employee to greet us and she needed to check everyone in one by one. Each passenger seemed to take 5 or more minutes until boarding passes and passport numbers were recorded manually. People were left waiting in line for about an hour or more. I was one of the first to get in, but there was already nowhere to sit, people were lying on the floor. The lounge offered some drinks and food which quickly vanishes and never gets replenished. Coffee machines are out of order. We spend the night there. We board at around 7, we don't take off until 9. We are given the reason for the delay from the captain: "the plane was late coming from America last night". After 10+ hour delay, we take off. Plane was old, lavatories were not in a good condition. Food was poor. The way back: flight from Sao Paulo leaves slightly late. We arrive in MAD ahead of schedule, however, at 5.00 am. Long story short: my 7.05 flight to Valencia is cancelled and I was put on the 14.30 flight, which is, what a surprise, delayed - we don't take off until 17.00. They did offer me a hotel for the layover, which was nice. But the rebooking process was as follows: had to exit the airport and go to the customer service desk at check-in level. There was no sign that says "Air Europa customer service". Nobody knows where it is, employees gave me the wrong directions. Customer service gives me a voucher for the hotel, but are incapable of printing a new boarding pass. I have to stay in line at check-in to get one. I make it back from the hotel at 13.00. Monitor says "delayed". Finally, a feisty employee was insisting that I check my small bag, because "it won't fit under the seat or overhead compartment because the plane is small". I asked if it's an ATR 42. She says "yes. I say, I've flown that plane before and my backpack will fit. I keep my backpack, it fits with no problem.

### "have only good things to say"
Miami to Barcelona via Madrid. I have only good things to say about Our Air Europa flight from Miami to Barcelona and our return Flight on 12th June. Our flight was smooth and comfortable, our flight attendants were awesome I especially want to thank an attendant on the return flight from Madrid to Miami, she was so kind and friendly! I would recommend this airline and fly again on Air Europa the food was great and the wine was quite good!

### "seats barely reclined for a 9 hour flight"
London Gatwick to Havana via Madrid with Air Europa. This was the worst flying experience I've ever had. The journey to Havana was delayed by 1 hour from London but at least we were able to get the connecting flight to Havana, which was then also delayed by an hour - no explanations provided. The food provided was poor, the inflight entertainment was all in Spanish, the plane was old and the seats didn't recline properly. The flight back was dreadful. It was delayed by 3 hours - no explanation provided. The plane was old - the seats broken, the space between seats so small that knees touched the seat in front, and the seats barely reclined for a 9 hour overnight flight so sleep was pretty impossible, and there was no inflight entertainment at all. No food or drinks were provided until we were 6 hours into the flight - and then it was horrible dried up sandwiches. Many people on the plane had connecting flights out of Madrid and we were assured that planes would be held and the connections made. With about another 25 people we arrived at the gate to board our connecting flight to Gatwick to discover that we would not be allowed on the plane - even though it had not yet left. We were told that we would be put in a hotel and could travel to Gatwick the next day. Most of the people on the flight from Cuba had the same experience and we're not able to get their connecting flights. We joined a queue at the Air Europa desk. It took us 2 hours to reach the desk to get information about accommodation - by this time the queue was about 200 metres long behind us and we had been joined by people who had been not allowed on to connecting flights to a range of destinations. In the end 8 people travelling to Gatwick stayed in the hotel and took the flight the next day. The others had to get the the UK the same day so arranged their own flights back at their own expense - no help from Air Europa. The flight to Gatwick the next day was fine, but then it was late landing, and the crew did not communicate with the ground staff about the baggage, so we waited 45 minutes for our bags and then I missed connecting trains. It took me 2 days to travel home from Cuba using Air Europa - never again.

### "first and last time"
I had booked 6 tickets with this airline as a family celebration to Madrid. We had never used this airline before and it will be the first and last time. We were delayed 90+ minutes leaving Gatwick, there was no explanation or apology. The air crew were sullen to the point of being rude. On the way home there was a particularly "charming" member of staff who when my son told her his seat was broken she just shrugged and walked away - didn't offer to move him, although there were empty seats. At the end of the flight two other staff members were so busy talking among themselves they did not say goodbye to passengers. If you have a choice do not use this airline.

### "my first and last time"
Madrid to New York JFK with Air Europa - I selected Air Europa as they have a partnership with Delta and I have been a Delta flyer for many years. I flew to Madrid on Delta and came back on Air Europa as they have a 5.40pm departure which was very convenient to not lose a day of work in Madrid. This was my first and last time. The flight was delayed by 3 hours with no communication. The seats on board are the old style business class seats that are not flat. Onboard service was poor compared to other airlines even though the business cabin was not full. The food was awful - very dry and horrible selection. The WiFi was terrible - it didn't work and was 22 euros for 50MB which didn't last at all (I didn't download files or stream). On my Delta flight from JFK to Madrid, I had great service, food, comfort and unlimited WiFi service which worked very well for only $16 USD for 24 hours which can be used across multiple flights.

### "disappointed with the cabin crew"
Frankfurt to Lima via Madrid with Air Europa. Flight from Frankfurt was delayed for 1.5 hours, so the connection in Madrid was very short. For all flights a bus transer was necessary - the direct gangway seems to be to expensive for this airline. I was very disappointed with the cabin crew - especially with small children they were very unfriendly and not cooperative (I myself haven't got kids, but close to me there were a few). The catering reflects the price level of the airline and the same for space and entertainment. They offer only a few movies, but all in 7 languages, and the selection was not too bad.

### "staff rarely came around"
I read the reviews for this airline prior to my flight so I knew I was taking a chance, flying with Air Europa proved to be a big mistake. I was on a round-trip fight from New JFK to Barcelona with a layover in Madrid. All flights were delayed and the return connecting flight from Madrid to New York was delayed 3 hours but we were not informed until we actually got to the airport shortly before scheduled take off. They did give us a free sandwich from a local sandwich shop in airport which was good. The worst part of the travel was both flights had limited air-conditioning and I felt like I was in a sweatbox for seven hours, it was awful. The staff rarely came around and offered a drink even though that cabin was so hot. Also on the flight from Madrid they didn't turn off the cabin lights even though we traveled in the evening and most people were asleep they didn't turn them off until five minutes before landing. Also, they had onboard entertainment but the movie shut off every 15 minutes and I had to keep restarting it, at one point I just gave up. Because of the bad complaints I tried upgrade my flight to business class however on my first flight they told me I would have to cancel and rebook the whole flight which didn't seem like a good option for me. I tried at the airport to upgrade my return flight my they wanted me to pay €3000 so that wasn't going to happen. The only bright spots for me with my bag was that it was quickly at baggage claim when I got home however my ride was late so didn't matter. I must say the counter the staff were very pleasant, however I will never fly or recommend Air Europa.

### "flights all left late"
We took Air Europa from Miami to Madrid. After 2 days flew to Barcelona, 8 days later Barcelona to Madrid and Madrid to Miami. The flights all left between 30 minutes to 2 hours late. Regarding the meals don't count with the what is served aboard because you will be disappointed. When we flow from Madrid to Miami the crew staff was rude, for dinner they served only one option of sandwich with cheese and pork which some of us couldn't eat - I asked if there any other option because I can't eat pork, one of the crew members told his colleague "We have vegetarian sandwiches but if we will give him one, every one else on the plane will ask for one". Usually with my experience on flights there is a vegetarian dish for some of us who don't eat meat, but in my case the crew member just told me that there is nothing he can do for me.

### "avoid flying with them"
All 4 flights I took with Air Europa on my recent trip to Havana via Madrid, were either late departing, late arriving or both. The transfers were chaotic and badly organised. The first flight UX1014 to Madrid left Gatwick late, arrived late and as such I ended up running for the next flight UX51 to Havana. When checking in I asked if luggage had made it on the transfer and was told by the gate crew all luggage had transferred ok. On arrival in Havana, the plane was 45 minutes late as it had no docking bay. Amidst the total chaos at Havana airport and with no assistance from any staff or Air Europa representatives I had no alternative but to wait to see if my bag turned up, after waiting 4 hours and by 12.30 am to see if my case arrived I was told ‘no more bags, maybe later’? I queued for another hour and eventually reported the loss to lost property and was given the receipt. As a result of these delays I missed my pre paid transfer and had to hire a taxi to take me to Havana at a personal cost of $30. After numerous calls, messages to the lost property etc I was eventually reunited with the bag 5 days later – when I was in Trinidad, Cuba some 3 hours away. I will not bore you with the details of the arguments I had regarding who should pay for me being reunited with the bag, enough to say when I was told I would have to pay $400 for a private taxi to bring it to me in Trinidad my patience snapped. To continue on my cycle trip I had to buy toiletries,spare clothes, bag to carry them etc all of which I don't really want or need, I had to borrow socks and other items all of which is incredibly embarrassing and inconvenient. I had been no better than a nomad for 4 days on what should have been a great holiday, begging and borrowing, carrying my possessions around in a carrier bag. In addition to the loss of my bag I actually reserved on Air Europa web site seats prior to departure (at a cost of £48) which I did not receive these on the return leg – no explanation just ‘this is the only seat’ at check in? Despite over 40 emails and letters to the airline they continue to ignore all responsibility to the point when I call and speak to someone in English they hang up on me!Customer serivce with Air Europa doent seem to matter at all I will do everything in future to avoid flying with them. On a long haul flight there was no films available at all on any flights so beware if you are flying with them take a good book.

### "not be flying Air Europa again"
London Gatwick to Buenos Aires via Madrid. On the holiday of a life time I treated myself to business class. On our return from Buenos Aires we were delayed by 60 hours and given very little information from Air Europa. We eventually flew back, I was in an economy seat as no business class ones were available. Air Europa have declined to give me any refund of the difference. I even wrote to the UK director 6 weeks ago but have had no reply. I will not be flying with Air Europa again.

### "treated in the worst way"
Madrid to Santo Domingo with Air Europa. I bought a non-stop ticket and at the airoort we were told they are putting together 2 flights because they just had only 1 aircraft. They took us first to Cancún in Mexico and left us for 2 hours on the aircraft and then new passangers going to Madrid got on. I was supposed to arrive in Santo Domingo at 6:15pm and I arrived at 12:30 am after being treated in the worst way possible.

### "unhelpful surly cabin crew"
Simply dreadful flight with Air Europa from Madrid to London Gatwick. Delays, buses to and from plane, unhelpful surly cabin crew, more delays, zero concern, help or even a mild interest in providing any kind of decent service. Business class was beyond a joke. I'd sooner drive to Bilbao and catch the ferry than do this again.

### "never fly Air Europa again"
Liege to Havana via Madrid. I was due to fly with Air Europa (member of skyteam) from Brussels to Havana with a stopover in Madrid. Given the terrorist attacks in March the flight left from Liege airport instead of Brussels airport. I was not notified of the change at all. I only found out because I could not find the flight on the website of Brussels Airport. Air Europa website was always down. Once I arrived in Liege to check in I was told I could only get the boarding pass to Madrid because their IT system could not print the Madrid to Havana leg but the the Air Europa desk in Madrid would print the boarding pass. They said they had been doing this every day since 22 March and that it was business as usual. We were a dozen of people in the same situation. Once at Madrid we went to Air Europa desk as instructed by the Air Europa staff in Liege airport. However they told us to go to the boarding gate as they could not print the boarding pass there. We walked towards the gate that was 20 min away, but could not pass passport control because we did not have a boarding pass. There were some helpful staff from Madrid Airport that tried to reach Air Europa. Apparently they were told that Air Europa staff was arriving. They never did. I had 3 friends also travelling with Air Europa from London who were also in transit in Madrid so I called them to tell the boarding gate staff we could not pass security. My friends were told that it was all under control, that our boarding pass were being printed and that the plane was waiting for us. Next thing I hear is that the plane to Havana has taken off! We were told to go to go back to Air Europa desk who said they cannot do anything (not call customer service or anyone responsible) but that we should pick up our luggage and go to customer service outside the airport. They were not helpful or apologetic. We went to the luggage area where we were told that our luggages had actually left to Havana without us! They also said this problem was happening every day (dozens of customers flying from liege airport don't make their connection ). This is an important security breach as they are not allowed to send luggages without the owner. We then went to the customer service outside their airport and queue for another 2 hours. By that stage we had been in Madrid for 4 hours and had not met one helpful or competent Air Europa staff. Not sure what is happening next as I am still in the queue but one thing is sure I will never fly Air Europa again!

### "gladly take them again"
I flew Miami to Madrid on a fairly new new Air Europa Boeing 787. Having flown them before, and expecting especially cramped quarters I was pleasantly surprised by the layout. Economy seats are 3x3X3 and reasonably roomy. I understand the seat width to be 17" but it seemed ok for me. They provided a hot meal followed by a breakfast or a pizza type snack an hour or so before landing. The IFE was pretty extensive, offering movies, TV shows, games, etc, There was a choice of English or Spanish. The air fare was about $650 r/t, but they charge $25 per segment, for an advance seat assignment. Considering the low base fare, I paid for it, though it looked like you had plenty of choices of seats left till just before boarding. Take your chances. Everything on time, or close to it. Cabin service fine and frequent. Would gladly take them again.

### "could go on about how bad"
I was flying Air Europa from London Gatwick to Santa Cruz de La Palma (SPC) via Madrid and Tenerife. The flight from Gatwick to Madrid was delayed by approximately 3 hours. No one from Air Europa showed up to explain what was happening, all we had was a message on a screen at the Information desk saying that missed connections would have been re-arranged once we got to Madrid. However when I got to the gate they started sending people on connecting flights back to the departure lounge to have their flights re-arranged from London! I asked if I had to do the same but they told me that my connection was fine. Except, when I was boarding they stopped me and told me that my connection wasn't fine any more! So I had to go back to the departure lounge where they booked my new flights. They put me on the same flights combinations the day after, meaning I would arrive in La Palma with 24 hours of delay. And the day after, the flight from London to Madrid was delayed again! This time it was only 30 minutes, but it meant I had to literally run through Madrid's airport to make it to the boarding of my connecting flight. I could go on about how bad and expensive the food onboard is, and what a joke the inflight entertainment is as well, but my review is already very long, so I'll stop here. The worst thing is that in a few days I will have to fly back to London with Air Europa again. I am not looking forward to that!

### "not happy with performance"
Amsterdam to Madrid return with Air Europa. I had high expectations when I arrived at Amsterdam Airport School, but was disappointed. Dropping off my luggage took longer than expected as everything went on a slow pace over there. When everything was done and at the gate, our aircraft was delayed by an hour or two. I was extremely disappointed by Air Europa's ground crew as they gave little or no information that our flight was delayed. After a wait of two hours for our aircraft to arrive, we had to wait another hour inside the aircraft for a slot to open, so we could depart. Captain explained us perfectly and gave his apologies. It was quite hot in the aircraft, so cabin crew thought to start giving water to the passengers, but suddenly stopped doing it leaving me and many more with nothing. As Air Europa isn't known to be a low cost airline and being a member of Skyteam, I expected them to give a free meal plus drink en-route, but you have to pay for this service, which was dissatisfying as I paid a quite expensive ticket. I was not happy with Air Europa's overall performance of this flight. They could have performed much better.

### "one luggage lost again"
My nightmare flight from London Gatwick to Sao Paulo via Madrid (connecting onto Florianopolis) started on the check-in. I was waiting to do the check in and when it was my turn the lady said I was on the wrong queue, so she pointed me the right queue and when I went to do it, they said that the had just closed and I couldn't enter anymore. I tried to explain that a member of staff advised me a wrong queue but they didn't want to work apparently, I was so nervous because if I didn't catch the flight I would lost my trip. It was a nightmare to have someone to talk to, no one from Air Europa was at the airport, after hours trying to do something, a manager appeared and he said the only thing he could do it was that he could change for other dates but the price to pay was more £500, but I had paid already almost £900. But I had to go so I paid. The flight was for 2 days later. Okay, I went the flight was late, went to Madrid and then when I arrived in São Paulo I only had 30 min to take my luggage and go take the other plane for my final destination, I thought it was be this easy, I was very wrong. My luggage was lost for my surprise, went to do a claim and the lady made me hand write everything and said that my luggage would be with me in 1 week. I came back 1 month later and nothing was found! I came back with two luggages and they lost one again! Almost everyone on the flight had their luggages lost. I tried to call several times, spend a lot of money on the calls and until today, the first luggage was never found, only the second one!

### "absolutely awful airline"
Gatwick to Cancun via Madrid with Air Europa, and absolutely awful airline! The food was dire (salami sandwiches and lumpy pasta); I was shocked that this would even be acceptable for a 10 hour flight. Drinks were sparse and the air hostesses were dismissive and robotic. The organisation was a shambles (staff couldn't put people into a queue, they kept contradicting themselves, nobody knew answers to questions, half were milling about aimlessly whilst the rest abruptly barked orders at customers) and the flight was persistently delayed. At one point we waited almost 2 hours on the plane with no explanation as to why we weren't moving. Babies were screaming, children were irritable, folks were getting angry and the staff mysteriously disappeared clearly to avoid dealing with enquiries. There is no personal in-flight entertainment and if you want to watch any of their family films (on tiny screens dotted around the plane shared between 30 others) you'll need to pay €3 for headphones. Again, isn't entertainment standard across long haul airlines nowadays? It's cheap for a reason and I'll never fly with them again. They need some serious work on customer services and improving their overall image.

### "the food was beyond bad"
Santa Cruz to London via Madrid with Air Europa. Inflight entertainment is one TV per 6 rows or so, an old chunky TV that looks like it's tuned in to the 80s. The staff were ok, but look disillusioned themselves. The food was beyond bad. I chose vegetarian for my food, and I was served boiled vegetables and a little bread roll. Literally a small metal tray of boiled vegetables. I asked about it, and the steward says "sometimes it's good, sometimes it's bad". I flew once before, also terrible, never again.

### "pleasantly surprised by the service"
Amsterdam to Miami via Madrid and back with Air Europa. We had an excellent flight, service similar in business class to other airlines and nothing to complain about. Good flat bed seats in the business class. The flight was operated by LOT Polish Airlines, with a mixed crew from LOT and Air Europa. We were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the services of Air Europa.

### "I was pleasantly surprised"
I was very anxious about this flight from New York JFK to Madrid as Air Europa seemed to have terrible reviews across the board. However, I was pleasantly surprised. There was adequate legroom. My husband and I were comfortable. I have trouble sleeping on planes but he slept the entire night. The staff were very friendly and kind. Our food was adequate and we did get drinks (perhaps because it was transatlantic). There is little to no entertainment in flight, but we flew over night so I really didn't mind. And, we came equipped with Kindles, iPads, etc. The only aspect I was irritated with was reserving a seat on the plane. First of all, it was incredibly difficult to navigate their website and calls made to their customer service was equally irritating. Not only was the process frustrating, but I had to pay per seat to reserve them. Whatever savings I had on the ticket was essentially negated by this additional fee. I would fly them again, however, if the price was right.

### "pleasant and relaxing flight"
First time flying with Air Europa from Gran Canaria to Madrid. Tried to check in online, however problem with the website - so check-in at the airport which was nice - the check-in lady was very friendly and helpful. Boarded the aircraft - two crew welcomed me on board, was nice. Sat at my seat which were very comfortable - for an older aircraft the seat literally hugged you. Service was nice, came through cabin twice - no issues. A pleasant and relaxing flight, would recommend.

### "cabin in 1996 configuration"
Rome to New York JFK via Madrid with Air Europa in August 2015 for a cheap price. We flew  a Boeing 737-800 and A330-200. The cabin was still in the 1996 configuration and not the recent one shown on the website of Air Europa. So no personal TV and seats were uncomfortable and my headrest was broken. Food was not as expected. But cabin crew was kind and professional. So this airline is recomended for those searching a low cost airline for transatlantic or medium range flights.

### "missed my connecting flight"
Pathetic experience. Flight was delayed by more than 2 hours, I missed my connecting flight and resulted in waiting for more than 9 hours at Paris Airport for other flight. I received no support from Air Europa. It was nightmare. Even the complain process is so rigorous that complainant would give up. No Email procedure, you are require to write hand written complain and send it to Air Europa office.

### "no free food or drinks"
Gatwick to Madrid with Air Europa. Mediocre flight. Old cabin. FAs were okay as in not rude, but for sure they looked tired. Small PTV and mine was unable to operate until 15 minutes before landing. No free food, no free drinks. Looked at the menu but everything really looked mediocre. Flight departed 15 min late and arrived 30 min late. The only plus was the ticket price, almost the same as Ryanair, Easyjet etc but with complimentary 20kg baggage allowance and PTV on-board.

### "descended into a nightmare"
Flew Air Europa from London Gatwick to Sao Paulo via Madrid. A quite positive experience on the first leg of the journey quickly descended into a nightmare upon arriving at Madrid at 8pm. We were told the second leg of the journey was delayed as we were stepping into the terminal. After a long argument with the staff, they finally agreed to put us in a hotel, however it took us over 3 hours to check in, given the vast number of passengers, leaving us only 1 hour for rest. The next day morning. Surprise. The replacement flight scheduled for 8.30am was delayed again. We boarded at 9.30am and didn't take off until 10.15am. Food was served three times on board but none of the items that they served qualified as food. Breakfast was soggy bread, spinach and egg that had been left in the foil for so long that the whole dish was green. Lunch was conventional white bread. In terms of the seat, it does't feel clean and there was no entertainment system for a 12 hour flight. Could a flight ever been worse? No. Air Europa you did it.

### "disgraceful treatment"
Disgraceful treatment. Chose Air Europa because the Direct Flight Madrid to Puerto Rico was a perfect start to our cruise holiday. Paid an extra 230 euros to secure extra legroom seats on both legs of the journey. Booked it 11 months before cruise. Everything was confirmed in writing including our allocated seats 15H anx K. A perfect start to our much anticipated reunion cruise with our cruise buddies from Chicago - or so we believed! In October we were informed by email that our flight was now going via Dominican Republic. The ground staff in Puerto Rico have since informed us that all flights are via Dominican Republic until High Season. So, it appears that our flight was never going to be direct! The next shock, on both legs of the journey we were denied the seats that we had been allocated and paid 230 euros extra for, even though we had printed all of the paperwork proving the booking and payment. So, we were cheated yet again! They have either sold those seats twice or accepted our money with no intention of honouring the booking! Strong words, I know but that is exactly what has happened and it is now down to us to try to recover our money. The humiliation and embarassment caused has no price. The experience in Dominican Republic was appalling with long delays late at night and no indication of whether we would be flying that night or not. It was midnight by now and all airport shops and restaurants were closed so no food or drink even though we had babies and young children in our group. At 67 years of age I have experience of many airlines all over the world but have never received such appalling service. If I can save anyone else from this experience then I feel I must. As pensioners we were expected to carry our hand luggage up and down steps and walk long distances which could not be forseen when we thought we were booking a direct flight. Also the extra leg room was a very important issue. We would never have chosen to sit where they decided to put us. I stress once again, this flight was booked for two reasons only. A direct flight and extra legroom seating. If these had not been available, I wouldn't have booked. I accepted that we would not be allowed to change this booking but it never occurred to me that Air Europa could change it!! How wrong I was!

### "seat was wonderfully comfortable"
Concerned to read such varied reviews about Air Europa. Our flight from London Gatwick to Madrid was incredibly well priced and compared to the easyJet flight that we took the week before, the seat was wonderfully comfortable and reclined. Staff did not noisily promote consumables throughout the flight. The crew were very well dressed and charming and the landing in both directions was faultless. Ground staff were courteous and efficient. One of the best cheap flights I have ever taken.

### "left without any information"
Air Europa from London Gatwick to Tenerife North via Madrid. Both our flights were delayed by an hour. Minutes before landing at Tenerife North the aircraft was diverted to Tenerife South where passengers were held for 45 minutes on the aircraft before being allowed to board. No one deemed it necessary to let passengers know why this was happening or possibly offer an apology. Passengers then had to hang around the baggage reclaim area for another 45 minutes without information about where and when the luggage might arrive. No information was offered by anyone from Air Europa about how to proceed from Tenerife South to Tenerife North which was the actual destination of the flight we purchased. One airport official initially claimed there was going to be a transfer bus for passengers but he soon disappeared and the Air Europa office was conveniently closed. Never have I experienced a flight where passengers are simply dumped at a destination they didn't book to go to and left there without any information or any effort to help them get to where they actually paid to go to.

### "plane in good condition"
Barcelona to Tenerife North. The plane was new and in good condition, flight attendants were perfectly reasonable, albeit lacking a bit of warmth maybe. Service was non-existent as it is on so many European airlines these days, but buy-on-board prices were fair and the selection was good. Flight was on time and our bags first on the belt (owing to Sky Priority). Not perfect, but as good as it gets for a sub-3hr low-cost flight in Europe these days.

### "nothing to complain about"
Madrid to Miami, an excellent flight, service similar in C class to other airlines and nothing to complain about. The flight was actually operated by LOT Polish Airlines, with a mixed crew from LOT and Air Europa. Price against service in business class is one of the best option on this route. It will be more pleasant when Air Europa will operate its own Boeing 787.

### "absolutely charming flight crew"
Did I travel with a different airline to other reviewers? Yes, first and last leg is usual short haul shuttle, pay for snacks but the long haul section was the proof of the pudding. Absolutely charming flight crew, jolly decent economy meal with good wine and soft drinks offered and served on request. New and clean Airbus with good individual systems on the return but shared on way out. Film menu well chosen and balanced. Boarded by rows and departed on time. Good announcements and attention to turbulance. I've flown London - Asuncion 3 times a year for 8 years and these flights stand out. Air Europa are serious competition for TAM BA TAP KLM but not quite Air France or Lufthansa. Leaves Iberia trailing behind.

### "worst I have ever had on any airline"
The Air Europa company magazine which I saw on the first sector advertised plenty of entertainment on the transatlantic routes. Our route was approximately 10 hours from Lisbon to Montevideo via Madrid so we looked forward to some good movies. Not only that, but the screens were the drop-down kind in the centre of the plane. The seats were the ones used before smoking was banned and still had the ash-trays covered by metal plates riveted in place. The only fruit juices available were orange or grapefruit. Hard luck if you like a Bloody Mary. Breakfast was, without doubt, the worst I have ever had on any airline. It consisted of a squashed sort of bread finger, with a mushy filling, which had been microwaved to the point of intangibility, a fruit flavoured yoghurt, which I believe had never seen real fruit, a small pastry (the most edible part of the meal), and tea or coffee (instant I think) with a packet of that non-dairy creamer stuff. Couldn't even get a glass of milk.

### "a bad experience"
Amsterdam to Salvador via Madrid with Air Europa. On the first flight my seat was broken and couldn't get into upright position. A person a few seats in front of me had a disfunctional remote for the screen, and I noticed a few other people with that problem. The staff was chaotic and spoke poor English. On the return flight there was no inflight entertainment. Also, the headphones are not free and have to be paid onboard. The meals are ok, but not the instant coffee. All and all a bad experience, and a disgrace to the Skyteam.

### "disorganisation, chaos"
Dont do it! Gatwick to Sao Paulo via Madrid with Air Europa. Delays, disorganisation, chaos, few (unfriendly staff) little food and you have to beg for water - and they don't want to speak English. Took two hours for the three staff (then two) to check in the whole plane. So long that they had to hold the flight for us to board and delayed the flight. Food and water non existant. At Madrid same again, one metal detector for the plane load of us to get through. Ran to get to the gate in time, more extended queuing. Didn't need to worry as they didn't seem keen to take off on time. Long queue for the next leg, once through the boarding gate I got dragged aside and asked for my flight number for the return journey, which after much drama they looked up. No idea why. Dinner was okay. Anyway I've never encountered anything like this before. Total chaos.

### "low-cost style"
Milan to Montevideo via Madrid with Air Europa. It is one of the worst airlines I have travelled, and in which the service is low-cost style, but at the price of a normal airline. On both the outward and return flights, the seat did not recline correctly and another passenger's seat was broken. Old aircraft and poor maintenance.

### "a very good price"
I'm not pleased at all with my experience with Air Europa. They advertise a direct Miami to Madrid flight, and then pick up passengers in Santo Domingo. The additional weariness from Air Europa's delays, coupled with a prior flight to Miami, was most unwelcome. My connecting flight in Madrid was long gone, to which Air Europa offered me either a hotel or a train (I chose the train). I am understanding the fact that it is difficult running an airline, and that safety must come first, and I arrived safe and sound in the end. So I am not writing Air Europa off entirely for now. My rating of 6/10 is largely based on the ticket price, which was 442EUR - a very good price. I'd be much angrier had I paid double that.

### "service just gets worse"
I flew with Air Europa from Madrid to Caracas on January 15th. First of all the flight took off from Madrid off 2 hours. I had purchased a seat with extra leg room at the back of the plane, row 40. It was quite a comfortable seat in that it reclined quite a lot, however I hadn't counted on the extremely badly behaved children screaming at each other and constantly running up and down the aisles. I mentioned this to the air hostesses, but no action was taken. There were no entertainment screens at all in the plane (really the dark ages) and if you wanted in flight entertainment, you had to fork out 10 Euros to obtain an I pad - something I did not do, on principle.The food was appalling. It was a 9 hour flight and lunch consisted of chopped up pasta and minced meat and the evening meal was pieces of very dry pizza. Of course we landed 2 hours late and the cases took 45 mins to appear. I paid $1,500 for the joy of flying with Air Europa as there is a very limited choice of airlines from which to choose on the Caracas to Madrid route. The price of the tickets goes up every 6 months and the service just gets steadily worse.

### "wouldn't recommend this airline"
I reserved my vacation three months before my scheduled trip with Air Europa  from Miami to Madrid. When I arrived to the airport they told me the day of my trip in the ticket counter that my plane was "late" and it would not be the Boeing 787 but an old aircraft - I booked because I wanted to fly the Boeing 787. My flight was 4 hours delayed from my original scheduled time. My flight took off only to make a non scheduled stop in Santo Domingo to pick up more passengers. I waited 2 hours inside the airplane before taking off to Madrid. I wouldn't recommend this flying airline to anyone!

### "overall pretty satisfied"
I was overall pretty satisfied with my Air Europa experience, flying from Gatwick to San Juan via Madrid return. I booked Air Europa mainly because they were were considerably cheaper than any other airline for getting from London to San Juan. The times were also perfect for what we were looking for. The LGW to Madrid flight was slightly delayed but still gave us enough time to get to our next flight. There was only food and drink to purchase on the flight which is what we expected. Staff were friendly and helpful enough. Madrid to SJU left more or less on time, was half empty. Staff were friendly enough and getting drink during the flight was not a problem. Just had to go and ask, did have a problem with a tv not working in our original seat but they were happy for us to move. Seats were pretty comfy, screens were big compared to what I've experienced on British Airways. Not a huge choice of films but enough to keep me occupied. Food was ok, not great but ok. The return flight had a few more than outward. Legroom in seats seemed less than on outbound and cabin seemed quite warm. Flight however left and arrived on time, food was pretty tasty and service was friendly and helpful. Madrid to LGW was a full flight, a little chaotic but everyone got on ok and flight left on time. Seats were pretty roomy, in fact had more leg room than on long haul flight. Service was okay, they didn't seem to take too much notice of the call button though. Overall, Air Europa offer a low cost tickets yet their service from my experiences were certainly no worse than I had encountered on other airlines who are far more expensive to fly with. I would fly Air Europa for this route again ahead of American Airlines or British Airways.

### "Terrible experience"
Paris to Valencia with Air Europa. My bag didn't arrive to my destination. I had to queue for 3 hours in the airport to speak to Air Europa customer service. They said that my luggage would arrived that night but they didn't know if they would be able to deliver it to me in the next few days. I came back to the airport next morning hoping my suitcase would be there as I didn't even received a phone call to confirm. There was 5 rooms full of suitcases on top of each other and it was imposible to move anything or walk in. I found my case in the last room, it was broken. I went back to the customer service office and they said that Air Europa was not going to take any action because the suitcase was only broken on a corner an only one wheel! Terrible experience.

### "staff were friendly"
Convenient travel with Air Europa from Paris Orly via Madrid to Miami and return. Nothing to say really. Inflight staff were friendly. Plane proper and clean. Food very bad, did not eat at all on the return flight. The Boeing 787 is an excellent plane. Will take Air Europa again.

### "avoid airline in the future"
London to Havana via Madrid with Air Europa was dreadful! Booked extra legroom seats 10 months before going and only at check in online did we see we didn't have them! 40 minutes to customer services to resolve but on our return flight check in, discovered it hadn't. Great staff in Havana though! Delays in London meant flight had to be held in Madrid - no ground staff to explain/ direct passengers In flight entertainment - back in the dark ages. Food poor. Whole package was one I'd not want to repeat. Unfortunately going to Cuba flight choices were limited. Will do everything I can to avoid airline in the future! Will be interesting to see when I get my refund for seats - not cheap at £45 a seat on each leg. They seem to need lots of bank information to do a credit but a debit is easy! !

### "overall pretty satisfied"
Gatwick to San Juan via Madrid return. I was overall pretty satisfied with my experience. I booked Air Europa mainly because they were were considerably cheaper than any other airline for getting from London to San Juan. The times were also perfect for what we were looking for, LGW to Madrid flight was slightly delayed but still gave us enough time to get to our next flight. There was only food and drink to purchase on the flight which is what we expected. Staff were friendly and helpful enough. Madrid to San Juan SJU left more or less on time, was half empty. Staff were friendly enough and getting drink during the flight was not a problem. Just had to go up and ask, did have a problem with a to not working in our original seat but they were happy for us to move. Seats were actually pretty comfy, screens were big compared to what I've experienced on BA. Not a huge choice of films but enough to keep me occupied. Food was ok, not great but ok. Overall flight was fine. The return flight had a few more than on outward journey. Legroom in seats seemed a less than outbound and cabin seemed quite warm. Flight however left and arrived on time, food was pretty tasty and service was friendly and helpful. Madrid to LGW was a full flight, a little chaotic but everyone got on ok and flight left on time. Seats were pretty roomy, in fact had more leg room than on long haul flight. Service was ok, they didn't seem to take too much notice of the all light though. Overall, Air Europa offer a low cost tickets, yet their service from my experiences were no worse than I had encountered on other airlines who are far more expensive to fly with. I would fly air Europa for this route again ahead of American or BA.

### "Air Europa is the worst"
Gatwick to Barcelona via Madrid. I have flown this airlines numerous times over the past 3 years to Madrid, Barcelona, Malaga, Santiago de Compestela, and La Coruna. I have chosen it since it is a partner with Delta, but I regret using them every time. Air Europa has the worst customer service of any airlines I have flown, and they seem to have an issue with customers connecting from Delta. I was connecting from Delta to Air Europa, and the customer service agent tried charging me for luggage even though it was a connection and I am Diamond. When the supervisor came over and agreed that I shouldn't be charged, the agent made a comment about Americans. I wrote Air Europa a letter with the name of the agent and his inappropriate comments, but I received no response. Clearly, they have no problem with their employees bad mouthing people. The airline is frequently late, and one of the planes upon landing at Barcelona broke an axel and we were stranded on the runway. Finally, they rarely follow through and give the Delta frequent flyer miles. I fly over 120 flights per year on many airlines. Air Europa is the worst.

### "had to pay for everything"
We flew Air Europa for the first time to go from Paris to Miami via Madrid. The plane was dirty, flight attendants unfriendly and we had to pay for everything. First flight from Paris to Madrid we have not been offered any food because they only had the time to do the first 10 rows. The plane was 2 hours late and we have never been told why. Regarding the Madrid to Miami we had to pay to have some headphones. I had not seen that in years for a long distance flight. Less than 10 movies were offered which really is poor.

### "deploring treatment"
Helsinki to Madrid via Amsterdam. Absolutely deploring treatment of passengers. First of all, Air Europa uses a different booking system than Amadeus. This means if you're flying a code share from a city without direct Air Europa service you will not be able to get onto your flight. After a long discussion with all the check-in personnel of the Skyteam airlines in Helsinki (Air France, KLm and Aeroflot) it became evident that there was no way I would be able to get onto my KLM code share. With an unresponsive and disgusting customer service at Air Europa, the KLM desk urged me to buy a new ticket from their desk as I would miss my flight otherwise. Of course I bought the flight, and obviously I have insurance for these things, but Air Europa is a definite avoid. I fly very often and have not encountered problems of this scale on any European route before.

### "enjoyable and uneventful"
I have had the pleasure of flying with Air Europa twice this year from AGP to YVR via CDG and AMS. Both times the experiences have been enjoyable and uneventful as they should be. Being 6'5" most airline seats for me are rather difficult to slide into even on a good day. The check-in staff at Malaga Airport offered me an exit row seat without me even having to try and request one.

### "better than expected"
Munich to Tenerife via Madrid. Air Europa is better than expected compared to recent comments, very friendly service. English and German speaking purser, food not worth to mention but okay. Both flights were on time, seats same as economy - three across in a row, with the middle seat not occupied.

### "experience perfectly pleasant"
Miami to Lisbon via Madrid, and my Air Europa experience was perfectly pleasant from start to finish. For their prices I found courteous and delightful service, more than acceptable food and an overall experience I would happily repeat. This is perhaps and an up and coming airline but I feel they are on their way to a respectable share in their market. Thank you for an enjoyable trip!

### "the journey from hell"
I had the journey from hell with Air Europa, flying London to Havana via Madrid. Starting from check-in at Gatwick Airport, there were only 2 counters open for the flight to Madrid, which extended the check in time to 1hr 15 mins. This left me with no time to buy food and other necessary things for my trip. I had to rush through security, then rush to the gate hungry. Arriving in Madrid the plane was held without the doors opening (which happened the previous time I took that flight and the same excuse was given) for 20 minutes, so I had to again rush through to my next flight. After boarding we were held inside the plane for 2 hours before it took off, which was exhausting and considering the lack of oxygen suffocating, besides the fact that I was now starving. As soon as I boarded the plane, one of the cabin staff wanted to move me from my seat without any explanation. He kept dragging me to different seats all over the plane and when I enquired why am I being moved, he got angry that I am asking. Then I thought luckily I was given a vegetarian meal (which I was not on my previous flights to Havana and back despite booking the meals in advance and even though I complained officially and filled up forms I received no response). The meal was  horrendous. It consisted of half-cooked pieces of green beans and carrots and a rice. When I asked the air-hosted for another piece of bread she completely ignored me and never gave me anything. Then after arriving in Havana with over 1 hr delay and waiting for 1.5 hrs for my luggage it was lost with no record where it was. The Air Europa representative told me it is not her problem where my luggage is and that I should call head office in Spain for details. I called the office the next day and they ensured me my luggage is arriving that night with the 6.50pm flight and I will be immediately contacted by their representative to arrange delivery. At 10pm I had still not heard from anyone from Air Europa. I called the airport and was told by the airport staff that my luggage was there and with Air Europa and it is up to them to release it. At 11pm I had to take a cab across Havana to go to the airport to collect my luggage. As a result I had incurred additional expense of cab, telephone charges, buying temporary clothes, having to cancel a trip to another province in Cuba. Out of a 10-day trip, I went through such a horrible experience. I have never had such a horrible trip combined with appalling service and complete lack of consideration and customer care. Upon my return I immediately contacted the airline to complain. I was told to e-mail as their web-site would not recognise their own flight number. I have still not had a response.

### "experience is appalling"
Alicante to London Gatwick via Madrid with Air Europa. Possibly the worst experience on ground and inflight I've ever experienced. Flight from Alicante to Madrid was okay, though the planes are very dated for domestic flight and operated by Swift Air (ATR). After arrival in MAD discovered the flight was delayed by 1 hour. However, boarding was supposed to start 15:20, but no updates from ground staff when we were waiting until 16:00. At this point I approached ground staff to ask when to expect to depart. They flogged passengers and myself off with the flight was delayed arriving and now cleaners we late. However that plane had been sitting there on the tarmac since before original departure at 15:00. Ground staf told me to look at the screen which then the time then changed to 16:30. When mentioning what will happen as I will it looks like I will not make my next flight which had originally 2.5 hours between the ground staff just said "if it ain't Air Europa or partners we dont care". Ive never expereinced such poor attitude and rudeness in all my flying years. Eventually we boarded at 17:10 when it was stated they now have cabin crew available leaving 2.5 hours late. In air, the cabin crew almost ignored passengers and not even offered any drink during meal service which was not exectly of the best quality. I chose to to pay for anything but would be nice to be asked if you want any drink. Overall experience with this airline is appalling. Never flying this airline again.

### "never use this airline again"
Gatwick to JFK via Madrid with Air Europa. The flight crew were unhelpful, rude and snappy on occasion and unfriendly. Travelling to the United States it was well over 2 hours before we were offered even a drink of water. When the food finally arrived, they had run out by the time they got to us so ended up with some overcooked pasta and a blob of sauce on it. My daughter was huffed at on the return journey because she asked politely if she could have the bread as this had been missed off her dinner (and was the only thing she could eat). Had to wait a long time on the plane while they put our luggage on. The outbound flight we couldn't sit together on and although we were told on the way back we would sit together, this was not true. The outbound plane was very old and turbulance was really felt. We were charged $3 for headphones on way out and $4 on way back - neither worked so couldn't watch the IFE - heard other people complain too - staff were not happy when we asked for our money back and took an hour to do this. We were only offered drinks twice through the whole flight. Would never use this airline again, I've travelled on other economy flights and received much higher service.

### "the worst flight"
This was the worst flight I have ever experienced. I understand it is a Spanish airline but no one said a word of English. The flight was delayed for 2 hours and no one gave me a reason why. They never told us when we were boarding or when we were taking off. One minute I was staring at the runway, the next I was mid-air. The seats were uncomfortable. The food was terrible. I would've rather paid twice as much for a better airline than to fly on AirEuropa again.

### "not a business class product"
Madrid to Amsterdam with Air Europa. Despite their good intentions, the cabin crew could not cover the lack of interest of Air Europa in their business class customers. Horrible food, lack of drinks (after one service no more drinks available), no leg room (same pitch as tourist class?) and an overall tired impression of the aircraft. This service level is not to be taken serious as a business class product.

### "worst airline ever"
Flew Air Europa from Madrid to JFK and the worst airline ever. We chose Air Europa not because it was cheapest, but because it had departure time we wanted. Started at check-in. This was the only airline that insisted on weighting my laptop bag. Even discount airlines we used in Europe didn't do that! Carry-on luggage yes, laptop bag nobody. Got only worse from there. No in-flight entertainment for transatlantic flight. Plane itself in bad condition. Overhead luggage compartment was shaking all the time and making cracking noise. Asked for water - was told have to wait until after turbulence. Never got any. In short, worse than discount airline service at non-discount price.

### "the worst airline I've had"
Amsterdam to Tenerife via Madrid with Air Europa, and this is the worst airline I've had in my life. A 7 hours delay, and they flew us to another airport. Had to take a bus and cab on own costs. Car rental company was also closed, so we had to take another cab to Tenerife North the next day. No compensation or "sorry" had been given by the airline. No more Air Europa for me.

### "never again with Air Europa"
Too cheap is not good either. The Air Europa flight was fine, but the return flight from Havana a disaster. The return flight from Havana was 3 hours late, no information about this delay was given, even later on the plane. Our connecting flight from Madrid to Munich was long gone, we began asking questions until we were given a replacement flight from Service Counter of Air Europa (Iberia) - printed on an A5 piece of paper with dot matrix printers! The problem was that we did not get our luggage, as we were sent to the wrong Belt. We asked for help, and they said suitcases would come in 40 mins. They did they not, we asked again, with another employee who reacted a little hectic, began to call. We had to change the terminal twice (Madrid is a big airport). Then the flight was already closed. Conclusion : 3 hours  delayed, an 8 hour flight, 2 hours waiting for luggage, running around 2 hours to find a night in a hotel paid by airline. Since we were left nearly alone, no one cared about our concerns. Never again with Air Europa.

### "Air Europa trip was the worst travel ever"
This Air Europa trip from Lisbon to Montevideo via Madrid was the worst travel ever. There were no TVS, no earphones in a 12 hour flight. My seat didn´t recline (and also not the ones of my seat neighbors). The food was poor, but worst of that there were no spoons, or milk, or anything. One man ask for a spoon to mix his coffee, and the stewardess give him a napkin. I asked for milk for my coffee and the stewardess say that there was no milk! The bathroom was disgusting, the floor wet, the tank wasn´t working either. I understand that at Economy class you can ask for much, but service is just horrible. I will not recommend this airline.

### "friendly professional service"
Both flights punctual, infact we arrived 10-15 minutes early both times. Friendly professional service.

### "bag did not turn up to Miami"
I flew Air Europa with my wife to Miami. At Gatwick, I noticed the check-in girl had not put a transfer label on my wife's suit case and pointed it out. She said she would rectify it. The bag did not turn up to Miami and we had to track it down. The girl obviously did not rectify the label because the bag was in Madrid. It turned up 6 days later. Air Europa have made it very difficult for us to get compensation. The food was average on the flight and my TV did not work. The plane was dirty.

### Air Europa customer review
Currently awaiting to board my flight with his airline. Flight was originally sold as a Delta Air Lines flight, got to the check in and attempted to check in on a Delta kiosk and was directed to the Air Europa check in desk. Waited in line for 2 hours for check in! At which point I realized that flight was delayed by 4 hours. Had been waiting at assigned gate for 2 hours to be directed to switch to a very far away gate. Only to be at that gate and be told to return to our original gate. At check in the staff was polite. When I approached them to inform them that heir announcement wasn't audible in other gate I was given a very dismissive apology. So far, still at gate, waiting on my flight. For another 2 hours (hopefully not longer).

### Air Europa customer review
Perhaps the last time I'll pick this company. First of all, the in-flight entertainment was not individual, but shared. This was not the case with the flight MAD-JFK, at least, be coherent. Central seat row only. If that wasn't enough, they looked outdated. Was the aircraft old? The "dinner" and "breakfast" were edible, but nothing special. At least they gave beverages for free. The seats were uncomfortable.

### Air Europa customer review
My partner and I travelled from LGW-MAD-PUJ and we will not be flying Air Europa again! Air Europa is not a cheap airline by a long shot, however they treat the passengers as if they are flying for a cheap price! Their standard of plane for a long haul flight is extremely poor. There is no individual flight entertainment; something which is now a basic standard on long haul flights. The seats are very uncomfortable, and offer very little body or leg room, they are very cramped. Food was edible, but not great, however you are only provided with a choice of tea, juice or water, of which is only provided in one dose! Other drinks can be provided, but you have to get out of your seat and walk to the pantry, there is no service from the air hostesses. On an 7-8 hour flight, drinks were only served twice! On return the flight from Madrid to LGW was one of our worst experiences on a plane. Overall I am glad we made it to and from holiday safely, however we shall not be flying with Air Europa again.

### Air Europa customer review
Seats are absolutely not designed for the tall North European people. No individual flight entertainment. Food is poor and too small portions. Drinks are available but only if you are able to go to the pantry. On a 8 hour flight only once were drinks served.

### Air Europa customer review
JFK-MAD: This flight was actually pretty good. The plane used for this flight was apparently one of the newest in their fleet, and it showed. The interior was well kept, working TV's at each seat, and the seats were comfy. The food was pretty terrible but the staff were very nice. I didn't appreciate not being able to use the TV's for two hours of the flight because they were showing ads on them. MAD-BCN: I was upgraded to Business on this flight. The interior was dirty, seats were falling apart and drinks were served out of flimsy plastic cups. Crew were okay. BCN-MAD: Again the plane was very dirty, seat cushions were falling inside the backs of the seats (didn't even know that was possible) and the plane had a weird smell. Crew were beyond nice. MAD-JFK: This plane, this plane. All I can say was throwback to the 80's. The seats literally felt like cardboard, drop down TV's (that barely worked), and this plane had a weird smell too. Food was the worst I've ever had on a plane. But the crew were very nice. At all airports the Air Europa ground staff were beyond nice and helpful. Verdict: I won't hesitate to fly Air Europa once they have some better planes. But won't until they do.

### Air Europa customer review
It was announced there would be two in-flight movies. First, most of those passengers who actually paid for a set of headphones found there was no sound. Then the movie suddenly stopped, then it re-started, then stopped and restarted at a much earlier stage, stopped. Eventually, it did run through to the end - but the various stops and starts meant the second film never ran, at all. The food provided was the worst aspect, though. Dinner" was a minimalistic dish of chicken and rice, served with a bread roll, a miniscule salad (with no dressing, of any kind) and a small lemon meringue-type pudding. The "snack" was, allegedly, a "salad sandwich" - but actually consisted of a small, doughy bread roll, smeared with a layer of mayonnaise and containing three pieces of very thin, processed "meat", each less than 0.5 square cms. Breakfast" was another small roll, this time, "filled" with a very thin slice of processed meat, a slice of aubergine and a slice of courgette, accompanied by a vanilla yoghurt and a small, stale chocolate muffin.

### Air Europa customer review
Well organized boarding by seat rows and friendly ground staff. Cabin crew was professional and friendly but never saw them smiling during the entire flight. Because of the short flight time there was no on board food and drink service, which was fine. PA announcements were very fast and monotonous so you needed full attention to understand. The plane did not have any kind of IFE. In general I was satisfied with the service offered.

### Air Europa customer review
FCO to MAD. The flight was unmemorable from the service point of view, but was probably the most horrible boarding/security that I have ever experienced after 20+ flights. Boarding was a mess, there is no priority boarding for business class passengers, foods are served in plastic and there's only one beverage service. Food was eatable but not top-notch. Seemed like a snack service instead of a meal as it's too light. Seat was standard Eurobiz, but enhanced like a domestic US 1st class. But the ticket is EUR 250, only 15€ more than economy, and in this case it was cheaper than full-fare economy. Wouldn't hesitate to choose them again for MAD-BCN on A330. Choose a window out from FCO, as it's so beautiful.

### Air Europa customer review
I broke my foot on my vacation and the entire flight staff were amazing. The cabin staff were very accommodating and helpful. They gave me the extra room I needed to elevate my foot, helped me walk to the bathroom every time I needed to use it and frequently checked on me to make sure I was okay - the pilot even checked on me to see how I was doing. I appreciate the kindness of the staff and would fly with Air Europa again.

### Air Europa customer review
San Juan to Madrid was on time. No space for my legs in the plane. I had to put my legs next to the legs of my girlfriend because I was not able to stay seated in a normal position. The food was not good but okay. No cabin entertainment (IFE) but I don´t mind it as the flight was only 7 hours. This was the main advantage of this flight but I think next time I will prefer a more decent company like KLM or Air France even if I have to make stops. The most terrible experience was our check-in from MAD to MUC. We stayed one night in MAD and had a flight from to MUC at 7:20 am. We already had our boarding passes and we only had to check the baggage in. We were at the airport at 6am. There was a big line as all the passengers for all Air Europa flights have to stay in the same line which later splits to many check-in counters. I asked the employee in front of the line if there is a special urgent counter for our departure and she laconically sent me to the big queue. So we waited and arrived to the counter at 6:30. The employee at the counter told us that check-in of this flight is alread closed! She got a bit stressed and tried to call some colleague without success. Finally, she told us: "Take your baggage and run to catch your flight! It meant we had to throw away our liquids, two bottels of rum from Puerto Rico and my pocket knife because there was already no way how to get it to the plane! Air Europa should improve their check-in procedure and not leave all the passengers waiting in one line - they have so many counters at the airport which can do check-in for different flights with different departure times. I will never use Air Europa for this lack of respect to the customer.

### Air Europa customer review
The main flight is from MAD-LIM-MAD. First thing I noted was that in business class there are no personal monitors, you get an I-PAD with about 10 movies - was so uncomfortable to hold it. When seated I noticed that it is a recliner seat, which many airlines have and its ok. However, always the seat has for the legs a "bar" to put your feet so you dont slip down when you sleep, however they dont have it. The worst seat in business class I have had. The seats have electrical power points, however, its very hard to put your plug in and secondly it is that they don't work properly. Could not use charge my phone or or laptop to watch my movies. On the flight LIM-MAD I asked the cabin crew that I would like my lunch service to be served later (flight was at 10am so I had already had breakfast and didn't want to have lunch). The cabin crew were shocked and tried to convince me that I should eat now and not later. In total service is not their strong point. For me, the only reason I would fly them again is due to the fare gap that they have with airlines such as Iberia and KLM who fly as well to LIM.

### Air Europa customer review
MAD-ORY-MAD, Check in fast and easy, no lines both airports. Boarding by groups, all flights on time. 737, comfortable seats, nice FA, only food for sale. No bags checked, so no info on this. Convenient flights to Paris Orly, closer to city center. Will fly them again for sure.

### Air Europa customer review
I flew with AE from Frankfurt to Palma in Mallorca via Madrid vv. And when it is possible, I do not want to fly this airline anymore: I believe AE is not a low cost Airline but they treat the passengers as if they are flying for a cheap price. They did not offer even water for free. The seat cushion is like on Ryanair. From Madrid to Palma there was a delay for 1 hour so that I had to take a taxi to the hotel which is expensive.

### Air Europa customer review
I flew from Buenos Aires to London via Madrid in April. In brief: absolutely terrible experience. The airline managed to produce a 30 hours+ delay (flight to Madrid was cancelled) during which its staff at the airport acted completely incompetently. Barely anybody spoke English there was a 2 hours line to the check-in desk to get an information which bus was taking us to the hotel after the return to airport 24 hours later check-in counter opened only half an hour after arrival (their staff informed us that the responsible colleague has not arrived yet) and afterwards only one counter was opened for 200+ passengers. Worse though was the fact that after the flight was cancelled I clearly explained to the only English-speaking lady at the desk that I need to be in London on Monday morning in any case as I had an important meeting. She assured me that this will be taken care of and that the company will call me to the hotel to give me the details of a replacement flight. I never heard from her again and the company just couldn’t care less. Generally this whole nightmare ended only after we persuaded the only reasonable person in the whole staff to book us on a flight with TAM instead. Otherwise we would miss yet another connection flight to London and instead of 30 hours delay it would have been closer to 40.

### Air Europa customer review
Flew Gatwick - Madrid - Havana and return. Flights out to Havana were fine. Staff were friendly and helpful lots of information given out. The chicken meal on the Madrid - Havana flight was one of the best I have had. The breakfast from Havana - Madrid was not very nice a dried up roll and a thick slice of tasteless meat. The return flight Havana - Madrid was a total different experience. We had a very fed up male member of the cabin crew. All the other cabin crew were great. Firstly he was very scruffy worn out shoes a cardigan which covered up his name badge a shirt which did not fit into his trousers properly. We were sat 3 rows from the rear of the plane by the time he got to us he was obviously fed up as he didn't offer us the bread rolls or drinks. He also did not offer any drinks to the people on the two rows behind us or the one next to us. Whilst the other crew members were still collecting the finished meals and drinks he turned off the lights. The crew members on the other side of the plane were only half way through collecting. During "lights out" my friend went to the toilet and wanted to stand for a few minutes to stretch her legs he rudely told her to go and sit down and ushered her back to her seat. This is a 9 hour flight and you need to have a stretch when you are stuck in a seat for that long. Overall I was very happy with Air Europa and would fly with them again. It is a shame that this one member of the crew let the side down.

### Air Europa customer review
My wife and I travelled from Paris Orly to Madrid on May 8th. The connection into Paris with Air France was late meaning our bags did not make the Air Europa flight. The staff at Paris were helpful in ensuring we made our connection. The service onboard was quick. Since then Air Europa have struggled to locate our bags and even though they said they have found one of them it has still not been given to us.

### Air Europa customer review
Traveled from Miami to Paris with a connection in Madrid and what a surprise Air Europa turned out to be. Flights left on time service was wonderful food was better then expected and the inflight entertainment was fantastic. We flew on Polish Airways new 787 and everything about that plane was wonderful. Will not hesitate to recommend and fly Air Europa again in the future.

### Air Europa customer review
Business class. Terrible BRU check in by Skyteam counter. Old SN Brussels Airlines lounge (downstairs in Schengen Terminal). My first time in this new security and fast track. Embraer 195 pleasant good crew. Return check in and good IB lounge. Good food and drinks. Will recommend and will fly them again.

### Air Europa customer review
I flew Miami to Madrid on March 29 2015. Staff at airport were nice. Were boarded promptly and then sat on the plane for over an hour past scheduled departure with no announcement made. Apparently they were waiting for some paperwork. I was in business class and they brought me 1 beverage. 2.5 hours later that was all they had offered! I pressed my call button and no one responded. I had to get up and ask for more water. They provided an iPad for movies. I was on an Airbus 330-220 which is an older plane. The seats are lie flat but not totally comfortable (I put the blanket under me for more cushion). The service in business wasn't very good. The dinner meal was ok. They don't bring you hot towels for you hands when you first board but did right before the meal. Our flight was almost 1.5 hours late in leaving but the crew wasn't concerned as we had good wind in the direction we were flying so the flight time was only around 7.5 hours - the day before it had been over 9! They did not offer any other service the rest of the flight. I was waiting for breakfast when the announcement by the pilot was made they were making the approach to Madrid and would land in less than 1 hour. What? Where was breakfast? They never turned up the cabin lights and got people up. The crews excuse was "you were sleeping and we didn't want to wake you". I fly a lot and this is the first time this has ever happened. I asked the people around me if they had got breakfast and they all said no. I paid for a business class ticket and got second rate service! All in all though the flight was fine a little bumpy at times but we got to Madrid no problems baggage came off quickly. I can't imagine flying coach with this airline I would only book this again as a last resort.

### Air Europa customer review
I flew from Madrid to Porto on a lovely Embraer 145. The aircraft was small and cosy a little bit old but perfectly functional. It only has three seats per row two in the right side and one in the left. I was lucky and got one on the individual lane. The flight was pleasant on time and extremely quick (45 minutes) despite the weather was not too good. The comeback was on a Embraer 190 also on time and quick. It was a night flight and they kept the lights off so the journey was pleasant and relaxing. No services offered onboard it is nonsense on such a short trip.

### Air Europa customer review
We travelled Alicante-Madrid-Buenos Aires and return on Air Europa and being honest after booking we were dismayed at the poor online reviews. So it was a massive surprise to find that the cabin crew were friendly and extremely helpful the flights were spot on time the connections perfect and our luggage always arrived with us. The only downside was the food which was rather insipid compared to other airlines. Let me put it this way better than Air France or Iberia.

### Air Europa customer review
EZE-MAD and MAD-MXP. First flight from Buenos Aires to Madrid was in an old A330. Seat was regular and entertainment poor. Catering was the worst ever: in a 12hr flight they served one meal (2 star to be generous) and after 10hr only a little sandwich. Second flight Madrid to Milan was in a brand new A320 nothing to say. The good experience in a short range flight terrible in a long haul. Never again for a transocean flight.

### Air Europa customer review
I flew from London Gatwick to Havana Cuba via Madrid. The flight London - Madrid was on time check-in went smoothly. In Madrid I had 1.5 hour for transfer which went quickly. We boarded the plane on time however then we were told we would have a one hour delay which was a bit annoying. I reserved my seat 13C in advance - it had extra leg room as it was in the Emergency row and I was very happy with it. The only minus is that the seats felt a bit hard and on a long flight it was a bit uncomfortable. On the way back I was not able to reserve the same seat so I sat in regular 18F - aisle seat. I felt the leg room was quite small (I am 172cm tall). The return flight was on time and we arrived in Madrid in 8.5 hours. The on board entertainment could be improved - there were only 2 movies on during 9.5 hour flight. Please bring your own headphones as you need to buy them otherwise! I was pleased with the food and I have to say that staff were very nice and helpful on both fights serving plenty of water. It is a low cost airline so you cannot expect same service as from more expensive ones but overall I was pleased with them and the fact that I saved nearly £200 makes you forget the little imperfections.

### Air Europa customer review
LGW-MAD-GRU - Having done this journey direct from the UK I was dubious about the change in Madrid and sceptical about the £2k less difference in the BA price. Check was a bit gruff at Gatwick with the handling agents doing their best to ignore customers while discussing their weekend plans and gossiping about a poor member of staff who had just gone of shift . However the Lounges at Gatwick and Madrid were not as good as the Heathrow Terraces but much better than the rude and over booked facilities of the JFK Terraces. I felt the weak link here was the lounge in Sao Paulo on the way back which reminded me of a provincial airport with basic service and low quality decor. Air Europa may wish to consider changing this. The first thing that strikes you about this airline is the service and the pristine staff who respond to you every need as if their life depended on it  nothing was too much trouble. Dinner service was on a par with old BA first class with leather menus and five courses although the food was on a par with lesser Club World. The seat - was not a lie flat bed but very similar to Club World London City although the Air Europa Corporate colours are a bit garish for my taste. There were plenty of films to watch and an I pad if you ran out the regular on demand service. There was a the obligatory amenity kit comforter blanket and pillows at bed time. I cannot understand why the cabin was half empty! If I were considering another trip to South America I would seriously consider using Air Europa again - especially given the saving.

### Air Europa customer review
Overall the airline is decent. I departed from Miami Int'l Airport to Oviedo Asturias with a stop in Madrid. What stood out to me was the lack of PTV entertainment. Food was okay. Don't expect too much from this airline.

### Air Europa customer review
UX9118 MAD-TFN (23/9) and UX9049 TFN-MAD (03/10). Both flights were on Boeing 737-800 and on time. Online check in was efficient. Check in staff was friendly and changed my seat without additional costs. Crew was not friendly. They even didn't say hello when the people entered the plane (they were chatting). This didn't give a feeling of welcome (which I get when I fly KLM). English announcements were so worse that I didn't understand them at all. Surprisingly I got a free bottle of water when I asked for some water. Crew was very good in hiding themselves. I've only see them once to sell drinks and food.

Flew LGW-LPA return via Madrid. Got all of their types E195 LGW-MAD A332 MAD-LPA and return B738 MAD-LGW. The service was OK all flights on time. English announcements were very hard to understand except on LPA-MAD leg the crew on MAD-LGW leg were surprisingly poor in their English skills could not understand a request from the person sitting next to me for a tea with milk. This does not cause a particular issue though it is a Spanish Airline. The 738/E195 were far more comfortable than the A332's - I'm 6'2" and rather thought those A332's were only specified for Europe flying - reading reviews apparently not. I'd avoid them long haul if there's a chance of getting one. But to be very positive their fares were spectacular. They were a clear £100 cheaper with luggage than any of Ryanair EasyJet or Norwegian and £150 cheaper than Iberia. Check in was easy everywhere. Connections were good. Flights were very well timed 10.00 departures both ways. Madrid makes for a longer journey than direct but that does not really bother me as long as I can arrive a decent hour which I did. I would definitely use them again for flying in Europe.

I recently booked a holiday through Thomson Holidays in the UK. We were informed that they had booked us on Air Europa flights to Tenerife and return back to Glasgow. A 4.5 hour flight with no inflight entertainment no inflight magazines to read no provision for my dietary requirements the trolley dolly didn't even know what I was talking about when I asked for a cider from the bar! The overhead air mover above my seat was out of its socket and didn't work. What a third rate airline! If this airline is to be used again by Thomson Holidays god help their profit margins because travellers will refuse to book with them if this is how they are going to be treated.

Myself and my boyfriend flew a few days ago from Gatwick to Madrid - Salvador - Santiago to start our year backpacking. Our journey was awful before we even boarded the plane. We were told we would be refused entry to the country and handed back our passports in such a rude manner by the woman at the check-in desk. This was all because she couldn't read the itinerary properly. She then said we could still be refused entry in Santiago. This filled us with dread and worry throughout our entire flight which was 30 hours in all. We had no problem at all entering the country! Here are a few more reasons why our flight was such a hideous experience: All 3 flights were delayed and nothing was communicated about this and no hint of an apology was offered at any point. The entertainment system was so bad. My earphone socket didn't work. When mentioning this to a member of staff it was greeted by a shrug of the shoulders and no care about it. My boyfriend's entertainment system kept on freezing then rebooting. The food was vile. No communication was given at any point on how long it was till landing on both long haul flights. I would never fly with this airline again. A nightmare from start to finish.

I flew from Paris to Madrid and then Madrid to New York. From Paris to Madrid we flew on a Boeing 737-800 the standard workhorse of medium distance flights. Nothing was served on this flight and there was no entertainment. No problem. Both flights (outward and return) were on time and uneventful. Staff spoke French and Spanish. The Madrid airport is quite large and a lot of walking between terminals was required. No problem though. Both the Outward flight and Return flight were on time if not early to arrive. Very good. Both were Airbus A320-200 with the 2x4x2 seating configuration. Outward to JFK we each had our own individual entertainment systems. Bring your own headsets if you don't want to buy them for €3. Wine with dinner is free. Wow. Even on American Airlines you have to pull out your wallet on transatlantic flights. The return trip from JFK to Madrid did not have individual entertainment systems but rather 5 screens that showed one program. Not a film but rather a documentary about the history of the Ferrari automobile. From JFK there is no online check in possible whatsoever. I would advise getting to Terminal 4 of JFK early and standing in line. The Air Europa desk at Terminal 4 opens at 7 pm (for the 10 pm flight) but at about 6.45 pm they allowed us to start checking in. The Air Europa check in is located in aisle 6 of the check in area near El Al. I paid about €700 for my return ticket during the height of the summer travel season when all other airlines were demanding over €1000. I saved some money and the trip was fine. Interestingly arriving in Madrid there was no immigration whatsoever. We just stepped off the flight and literally walked out the door. There was no border control whatsoever not even the sight of a single border control agent or police dog.

I took this flight from Madrid to Cancun. I was surprised in the first flight when I was awarded an upgrade so the experience in Business Class was far more satisfactory than in the Economy Cabin. Economy Cabin space is pretty fair no individual entertainment and very fair quality and variety of food served. Thankfully the return flight was during the night and I was tired so I could sleep. I would suggest people to think twice prior to buying a long-haul flight in economy class.

### Air Europa customer review
MAD-BRU-MXP-MAD - C Class. Pleasantly surprised with this airline. All 3 legs were good. Check-in plus on board services. Hopefully they will keep it up. A little harsh on the language skills but not that much of a problem. They tend to overbook. Quite a breeze to fly them. All in all ok.

### Air Europa customer review
I flew Gatwick to Madrid and then to Lima - out on 23 July return 12 August. Outbound UX 75 was two hours late leaving Madrid so departed 02.00. For a 12 hour flight there were no individual screens for film viewing but service was OK seats very close and I'm only 5 and a half feet tall. Return UX 76 timing was good food just about OK seating better it seemed to me. Service though - the steward on our economy section was unfriendly curtly told me I would have to pay 1 euro for a second plastic cup of wine. Coffee for 'breakfast' was almost cold and he served about 2cm of it into the paper cup. Unpleasant. The toilets were not checked and ran completely out of paper supplies so I had to go and ask. The female attendants seemed to be more courteous than the male. Surely checking of toilets should be part of their flight routine. Baggage arrived correctly.

### Air Europa customer review
Business Class Rome-Buenos Aires with a stopover in Madrid. Business class is almost an unmitigated disaster. They have zero interest in serving Business class customers. Rome check in - They have a Sky Priority counter for Business but no agent at that counter. Rome-Madrid - On this first leg I was booked in economy because Business was full. I was told to check at the gate and if something comes up in Business they will of course switch me as I had a full fare Business ticket. I checked upon boarding and they did have a free seat but without any explanation said they told me could not switch me. Could not give me reason. One of the bathrooms was out of order so 1 bathroom for 200 passengers in Economy. Rome Boarding - Only 1 person to check through the 200+ passengers. Madrid-Buenos Aires in Business - Antiquated seats and IFE (probably from the 1990’s). Seat recline but with feet hanging down so uncomfortable to sleep. Food quality and service was ok onboard. Only non negative comment I have. Overall they charge normal business class fares but offer very little in return. Will never fly them again and suggest Business travelers to avoid them at all costs. Arrival and departure at their base airport Madrid - Amazingly they use buses so I presume they don't pay the fee to use the bridges. Very uncomfortable.

Inflight service was extremely poor and for a long haul flight between Madrid and Miami inflight entertainment was virtually non existent. The seats uncomfortable with little padding left in them.

It was a terrible experience flew from Miami to Punta Cana Dominican Republic on 7/18/14. Poor attention in the airport on board bad attitude poor service overall. I do not recommend flying Air Europa at any price.

### Air Europa customer review
This June was the first time I travelled with Air Europa from Buenos Aires to London and back. On The outward journey I was allowed and paid for extra baggage but on return this was not allowed not even if it had been a few kilos! However a couple travelling with a little boy were allowed to take 6 large suitcases (paying of course for the extra 3) is this fair? How can this be? Why wasn't I told that I could take it but not bring it back? What is the reason for such a ridiculous rule? The flight from Madrid to Buenos Aires had at least 25 empty seats two of which were next to me. In spite of the kind and friendly cabin crew this ruined my holiday. The economy of flying with this airline is no longer an attraction to me and I will not be considering flying with you again or recommending others to do so.

### Air Europa customer review
Caracas-Madrid-Amsterdam round trip. Four flights scheduled with this airline one of them with KLM in the Sky Team Alliance which was the only one that departed on time. Caracas-Madrid flight left 2 hours late this made me miss my connection to Amsterdam and with direct train to final destination. Returning from Amsterdam to Madrid flight left with 1 hour late. Connection from Madrid to Caracas 3 hours late There was no compensation or lunch. All passengers in transit to other cities in Venezuela missed their connections. The meals were scarce badly prepared and presented. No staff support to passengers related with the consequences of their tardiness.

### Air Europa customer review
Madrid to JFK. I fly Madrid - New York at least 4 times a year and this was the worst flight experience I have had. I was surrounded by a group of about 20 middle school students. They were all standing sitting on each other's laps kneeling on their seats and yelling across the aisles. Obviously this was not the fault of Air Europa but I have never been on a flight where passengers were allowed to be out of their seats like that for the entire flight. I asked the flight attendant if she could say something to them and she responded that she couldn't really do anything. She murmured something about finding me another seat and never returned. I later found out the flight was not full and my seat could have easily been changed. My seat wasn't aligned properly so I had to place my feet on either side of the seat in front of me which was uncomfortable. The seats didn't have individual TVs which isn't such a big deal. Unfortunately the American-made inflight movie was only available dubbed in Spanish. I asked the flight attendant which channel was the English channel because I could not find it after scrolling through all of the options. She vaguely muttered that it should be available and said she would go ask and once again didn't return. This flight cost me about the same as most others I have taken on this route but the customer service was abysmal. Equally expensive flight for worse experience. I will be avoiding Air Europa in the future.

MUC-SSA via Madrid Barajas: As it was the best option both time - and price-wise we booked Air Europa for our trip to the World Cup. Due to the ratings my expectations were low I even feared to not arrive in Brazil on time! Back in Germany I see this airline in a different light: the seats on the regional flight (Embraer 190) had sufficient leg-room on the overseas flight (A330) it was so comfortable that I slept like a baby. All four flights were 100% on time and last but not least the crew was friendlier than on the other two Spanish carrier I chose before. What I annoyed me a bit was that headphones were not provided free of charge.

### Air Europa customer review
We traveled on Jun 13th 2014 from MIA to BCN via MAD. First segment of trip was delayed 1.5 hrs. Reason: crew were not showing up to the flight allegedly because they were trapped at MIA security. Finally when they came 1 hr later they were "strolling" to the plane at a very slow pace and with a defiant attitude. No apologies whatsoever. Food service inefficient and poor almost inedible food. No blankets no pillows. They attempted to charge 1 Euro for a glass of coke not a can just a little typical airline glass. Once in MAD I have to say they made up the delay pretty well. Still we had a very tight connection with BCN. The plane stopped in the middle of the tarmac and a bus took us firstly to T1 to do immigration and then we had to walk back to the very same terminal where the plane left us originally. The walk back was no less than 1 mile. Once at D gates ready to board our flight to BCN we were informed the flight was delayed another 50 mins which turn out to be another 1.5 hrs total delay - so far 3 hours. Finally we got to BCN and went to pick up luggage another 1 hour or so for the luggage to come out. Extremely disorganized airline with a terrible service. Never again.

### Air Europa customer review
I have flown Air Europa several times over the past few years to Santiago de Compestela La Coruna and Barcelona. The customer service is consistently below average. It is a typical low cost airlines with no free drinks or snacks. They are a member of Skyteam but they have never processed the miles with their partner on any of my flights without requiring numerous calls. Overall a below average experience.

### Air Europa customer review
PUJ-MAD on May 20th 2014. The worst flight we have taken! A330 Aircraft tight without operative APU awful comfort bad food and crew very basic! Delayed without any assistance for 4 hours standing on the line at the check-in desks they made us pay a 30 dollar fee per person to go back to Europe.

### Air Europa customer review
BCN-LIM via MAD. If you pay budget prices expect a budget airline. Each of my four flights left pretty much on time (a one hour delay between Madrid and Lima on the outbound). The food on MAD-LIM was more than edible and plenty of drinks provided but I would advise bringing some of your own snacks on board. The airline doesn't provide entertainment options bar a shared screen showing a couple of movies in Spanish. Overall the experience was satisfactory and I have had less pleasant flights with bigger brand carriers.

### Air Europa customer review
JFK-MAD and vice versa. I was hoping to get some sleep and if the seats weren't so tight that could have been possible. Oh well I guess I'm not fit to be sleeping on airplanes. It would have been nice to have an individual TV but not a big deal each seat had a radio with a few music channels and a movie was on the overhead screens. They gave you a nice little blanket and pillow which I would hope were clean. Dinner was a choice between chicken or pasta dish. In the morning they offered a turkey and cheese croissant sandwich and muffin hot and cold beverages. People complain about airline food  but I found it to be wonderful. The cabin crew took good care of you. I got up like 3 times to ask for more water and it was given to me with no issues. People classify Air Europa as a budget airline but I was very happy. They were accommodating at the airport checkin desk asking us if we had preference to what seat type we wanted.

### Air Europa customer review
Just flew Air Europa to and from retro Havana. The experience was no way as bad as other reviews suggest. It was much like any other flight and better than some budget airlines. I didn't manage to watch any TV (personal seat back) as I couldn't figure it out but I could have asked I suppose - other people managed OK. The staff were friendly and offered drinks but I admit we avoided the food. On the way back I was even able to stretch out and sleep but we didn't have our own TV screens. (not a problem on a night flight). Catching your connection is stressful (We made it with minutes to spare) but that is Madrid airports fault as you have to queue and have your passport and hand luggage checked again (and they don't rush themselves). All in all not too bad but if you want to avoid any hassle and stress pay the extra and fly direct.

### Air Europa customer review
They sell you flights with connections but if they delay one of the trips they don't take any responsibility for helping you reach the next connection. We used this airline to go from Santa Cruz Bolivia to London Gatwick via Madrid. We had an emergency landing but we were told that in Madrid we would receive help to reach our next connection. When we arrived in Madrid the staff of Air Europa knew nothing so ended up running to reach the next gate and arriving there only to receive a "Gate closed" sign. If they were responsible for the delay they could have communicated with the gate to make them wait for us. We had to wait almost 8 hours in the airport with no food vouchers or anything. To make things worse on the way back the flight from Gatwick was delayed as well when we reached Madrid nobody helped us the security gate was closed and there was nobody from the airline who could help us - we did reach our trip eventually.

### Air Europa customer review
Our flight from Santiago to Gatwick via Buenos Aires and Madrid was rescheduled to give us nearly 10 hours in transit in Madrid instead of about 3. True we were offered a refund but that late on it would have been prohibitively expensive to book a different flight. What was really bad was that we weren't offered a meal voucher or even a drink for the long wait and when we contacted the airline's customer service to complain of the poor service we didn't get the courtesy of a reply. We would never use this airline again.

### Air Europa customer review
London-Madrid. I reached Gatwick airport very early since it was the first time travelling with my 6 month baby daughter. When we got there there was already a little queue which was really slow. Once we got to the check-in desk I was told my baby does not have a boarding pass so they needed to run further checks. We had to wait about an hour. Finally when almost all passengers were on their way to the gate this guy came telling me that there is no problem and we can go. It was quite a distance to the gate so had to run with my baby. They forgot to put the sticker on the pushchair so I had to demand one in the gate. I have to return tomorrow then I am not coming back to this company anymore!

### Air Europa customer review
Travelled from Gatwick to Havana via Madrid. No delays. Checked in online both ways and managed to get 2 seats together an aisle and a window both ways. Take your own inflight entertainment as it is almost non existent a small screen hardly visible with Spanish movies. The food is almost in edible so we took our own. You can get water anytime by walking up to the cabin rooms. A cheap alternative to the Virgin flight which is almost impossible to obtain in the school holidays unless you book a year in advance. It is also about££300 more each! Boarding was much quicker and the 2x4x2 seating makes it quite pleasant as the only person you have to disturb is your partner.

BRU-MAD-BRU - first time I have used Air Europa and I was impressed. Nice Embraer 195 aircraft on this route (2x2) both flights on time professional crew (far better than Iberia) easy and clear online booking procedure including free bag seat selection/change free no charge if you don't print the boarding card yourself. Overall a good experience and no hesitation to use them again for short haul flights in Europe.

I fly very often (1 round trip/month) VGO-MAD-ORY. I am very satisfied with the service offered. VGO-MAD always on quite new E195 with good legroom MAD-ORY with E195 or B737 in very good shape. On the first flights of the day you get free newspapers. Very good telephone customer service. I do not know about the quality of food as I never pay for it on the flight. I'd definitely recommend flying Air Europa in short-medium haul flights.

Flew from BRU to BUE via MAD and was quite satisfied. Pretty cheap tickets but found the flight enjoyable. Seats are comfy with good recline legroom ok and flight entertainment is good many movies. Quality of the food should be reviewed.

### Air Europa customer review
Flew LGW-MAD-CSS and back several times and - given the circumstances - AE did their best to get me from A to B. They allowed extra baggage (inexpensive rates paid prior) on top of a generous promotional allowance they provided overnight accommodation in Madrid when then London leg got cancelled and later re-booked fine Spanish wine (though this gets curtailed). True not the best food but it matches the price the worst uniforms in the world and their (lack of) sleeping arrangements (very 80s) only support this. I imagine the poor service is due to a lack of feeling international.

### Air Europa customer review
Sao Paulo - Madrid early January. Late night flight was delayed by almost one hour because of how chaotic that airport can get at night with so many long haul flights leaving at the same time. When on board only very cheap orange juice was offered as a drink. Staff were pretty careless in general I would even say the male attendants looked slightly scruffy. Before take off they were just giggling and eating at the front of the plane. Meal service was rushed and not even menus were handled in stead chicken or pasta were offered. IFE was slow difficult to understand and very poor in general. What really shocked me about this flight is when I woke up after sleeping a few hours is finding half of the crew sleeping in the empty business class seats! I've always seen a few reserved ones for the pilots but I never expected seen so many! On the other hand very comfortable seat and I managed to arrive to Madrid all fresh but the quality of the inflight service was bad possibly the worst crew I've ever had.

### Air Europa customer review
The LGW-MAD-HAV was turned into a hellish ordeal from a truly terrible airline. I've flown with a great number of airlines - this is the worst. We paid over £750 pp person and were treated far worse than you would expect on an Easyjet/Ryanair flight. Old aircraft no in-flight entertainment to speak of woefully (and deliberately) unhelpful staff food was awful cramped seating.

ORY-MAD-BUE round trip. Nice staff cheap tickets but poor food and IFE on MAD-BUE. Inflight plan map already available on 90s for other airlines. Seats Ok but airplane needs to be revamped especially bathrooms. Hope new A330 will be better. ORY-MAD with an embraer and back with a new generation 737 800 definitely better.

### Air Europa customer review
LGW - Madrid - Havana and return. The short haul aircraft was suitable for the length of flight but the long haul was pretty primitive! Old looking plane some bleached flickering unviewable screens dotted about for those that speak Spanish! The food was completely inedible! I'm not overly picky when it comes to airline food but outgoing was a rubbery pesto pasta with a sickly synthetic mousse type thing for pudding and coming back was a burnt chewy dollop of ground beef with hard rice! There was a little cake square that looked nice but unfortunately was dry as a bone! There was a lot of food wastage. Even the fruit juices taste like the cheapest juice money can buy. Flying direct with Virgin is more than worth the couple of hundred pounds extra to be honest! The Madrid to Gatwick leg was delayed due to a broken down aircraft plus offloading luggage of some no-shows so all in all that was our first and last connecting flight! Some of the staff on some of the planes were friendly but some very sharp!

Travelled to Cuba from Gatwick via Madrid December 2013 return Jan 2014. Seats reserved in advance via the charged service on website. Outward journey seats as booked return journey seat booked had already been allocated supervisor unable to change them we had queued for 2 hours at Havana airport because there were only two desks open. Inflight staff were generally unhelpful food was awful.

### Air Europa customer review
We had Air France tickets from Malaga to JFK and back from MEX connecting flights to/from Paris with Air Europa. Air Europa does not provide 24-hour online check-in. We arrived 80 minutes prior to departure at check-in in Malaga to find a huge queue that moved very slowly. 3 check-in staff only ours was rather unpleasant and grumpy. With 20 minutes to go for departure we were running to security leaving behind about 30 more passengers waiting to be checked-in. Arrived at the gate to be told to rush onto the plane. Onboard the most uncomfortable airline seat old and worn and hardly reclineable. They are also too short so half your thighs don't fit the seat and it inclines downwards so one has the unpleasant feeling of sliding off! Despite the delay we made our connection in Paris. On the return we checked-in online via Aeromexico (still all on AF tickets) but the Air Europa connection Paris-Malaga did not yield seat assignments nor boarding passes. At check-in in MEX we were told they could not help us because when you check-in online this apparently messes up the boarding pass/seating process on Air Europa. Once in Paris AF staff at the connection counter finally printed boarding passes for Air Europe. Yet again the seats were very uncomfortable and old and barely acceptable for a 2-hour flight. Staff just like on the outbound were very indifferent. If at all possible I would avoid Air Europa in the future. I can handle unpleasant staff but I would avoid them purely because of the discomfort of the seats on their B737 that seem to be at least 20 years old.

### Air Europa customer review
London to Havana with a connecting flight in Madrid. The planes are dated there is no space between you and the seat in front. The seats were so uncomfortable. The staff acted as though passengers were an inconvenience. On a 10.5 hour flight the so called 'all inclusive' food and drink meant you were given one small plastic cup with your meal then 7 hours later a disgusting pie thing. I asked for water as soon as I got on and was told to wait for 2 hours. Perhaps Cuba Direct were at fault by telling me that it was similar to a long haul Virgin flight. The only similarity was being in the air. Suffice to say avoid at all costs.

### Air Europa customer review
Flight UX-076 Lima - Madrid January 4 2014. Delay of 5 hours. Direct lie from the staff of the company calling weather problems as a main reason for delay (as we learn upon arrival at Madrid airport they had a technical failure issue). We missed 2 connecting flights (one from Madrid to Paris with Air Europa the other one non- refundable flight to Copenhagen from Paris). 6 hrs spent in line to get to company's staff extreme inefficiency bad management and non-existent customer support.

### Air Europa customer review
I flew LON-MAD MAD-LON in Air Europa's so called business class which is described on their website as 'we make you feel special'. The reason I took this airline is that the scheduled times were the best for me but in future I will certainly not fly with them except in economy if I must. The flight was an hour late departing from Lon but no announcement was made until it was already more than 30 minutes late. The flight to Madrid had the newer seats which were comfortable but that is where the business service ends. The flight crew (minus the purser) were rude and uninterested in their business customers I had to ask 3 times for a bottle of water when I asked if they had English language newspapers I was asked 'por que? (possibly because the flight is from London?) and the food was sub-standard wrapped in cling film and plonked down on plastic. When I asked for wine she simply banged one down and walked away swishing the curtain behind her. The return flight was also sub-par with two slices of cheese and two leathery pieces of chicken constituting breakfast. Such a disappointment it would have been better to save the extra 300 euros and bought food in economy.

### Air Europa customer review
I took an intercontinental return flight from Madrid to Havana. It was a daytime flight and except from the comfort of the seat this was an incredibly bad experience. The service was by far the worst service I've had in an airplane. The crew were very unfriendly and not co-operative at all. With dinner you'll get 1 drink. Apart from water or orange juice you have to buy all other drinks. The crew started serving food at a slow pace afterwards they came 3 times with coffee/tea and immediately afterwards the whole crew started to have dinner themselves. The stewards/stewardesses also didn't respond at all to the service lights you can switch on at you seat. I don't expect much from airplane food but this was one of the worst I've had. Air Europa also doesn't provide a personal entertainment system. It is still done by some general screens from the ceiling and was only broadcasting a movie in Spanish. Worst of all the movie was restarted 3 times and wasn't finished in the end. On the return way we had to wait an 1.5 hrs to get checked in. There was an enormous queue all the way through the departure hall. About half of the passengers still had to check in after us. So we asked for window seats (25% of the seats). We were told these weren't available anymore. So we asked for Aisle seats (50% of the seats). The ground stewardess told us she would fix this. In the end from the 10 people we were traveling with only 1 had an aisle seat and the rest were scattered through the whole plane on centre seats. Luckily this was a night flight and we were all tired. So we slept most of the way and didnt have to deal with the service or Spanish movie. The food was of the same standard again: really bad.

### Air Europa customer review
I must say that I was hesitant to take Air Europa after the reviews but found the experience to be really good. Granted our luggage went missing connecting in Madrid to Lisbon but the inbound flight was operated by Delta so who knows where the blame lies and I strongly suspect Delta. Service was good food much better than expected and flights on time. Cabin was comfortable. Someone's putting effort in here.

### Air Europa customer review
We travelled by Air Europa on 19th December to Cuba and returned 28th December - or started our return then! Both the outward and inward flights were delayed by around 3 hours both for different reasons. The delay of the return flight to Madrid was handled very badly by the airline. Even though the airline knew we were delayed and connecting flights were missed no arrangements were made to cater for this even though they had 8 hours to prepare! It took an extra 2 hours at the airport to get onward flights arranged for the following day after queuing multiple times and being sent to two separate terminals. They were woefully understaffed. The inflight entertainment didn't work on the return flight the sound was not being transmitted. There were only several large screen available which made the visibility of the screens fairly poor. The plane was fairly antiquated communication was very poor on why we were delayed on both flights. The stewardess's were miserable. I would not use this airline again.

### Air Europa customer review
Madrid to Sao Paulo last week. Airplane wasn't very new or clean and as we found out later on during the flight it had just come back from doing another route less than two hours before. Purser and flight attendants were extremely good and nothing was too much trouble they kept offering food and drink throughout the flight. Quality of the catering was average. No IFE during the flight so we were handed some iPads instead not many movies but plenty of games etc. Overall and considering how much more expensive the other tickets were with other airlines I can say I was fairly satisfied with the flight hard working cabin crew doing their best with probably not the best tools around.

Dec 7th flight from Montevideo Uruguay to Madrid Spain (12 hour flight): I was very concerned when I read reviews after purchasing my ticket. However I must admit the boarding process was efficient the plane was very clean and my vegetarian meals were above average in terms of airline food. The gate personnel and flight crew were very attentive and courteous. After a pleasant trip I reminded myself that a good review was in order given all the negative reviews I had read. Yes I would recommend this airlines and hope to fly them again in the near future.

### Air Europa customer review
I can't say I was impressed especially on the long haul sector. I recently did a London - Madrid - Havana de Cuba. The flight from London to Madrid was pleasant and aircraft was very new. For a regional flight it was very well equipped and decent selections for food purchase. Transit in Madrid was easy enough despite Madrid not being the most organized airport. The long haul flight to Havana was a different story. The staff do not seem to be well co-ordinated for boarding at all which means it was really slow as people were not directed properly. The aircraft was quite dated and my fear was confirmed that there was no individual TV. That was fine but my luck meant that my headset point didn't work (both times going out and return flight). Flight was full so not a lot of options there but force myself to try sleeping. Meals were average but the massive gap between meals were crazy! If they missed you because you were sleeping they won't come back to you even if they are still serving others further down the aisles. Overall can't say I recommend it.

### Air Europa customer review
I took a business class return flight from Amsterdam via Madrid to Lima Peru. The first leg from AMS to MAD was done with a smaller embraer aircraft. The leg space between the business class seats were the same as for economy which is not acceptable as I am mainly paying the higher price to have the comfort on board. The AMS business lounge was fine and ground service too. Arriving in Madrid I had 3 hours in the business lounge in Madrid. The difference was big. Mostly pre-packed food (sandwiches) in the fridge no choice of warm food. It was quite busy there and after a while all tables were littered with the plastic packaging. Nobody seemed to be responsible for cleaning it up. It looked very messy. This is definitely not how I would like to travel when I pay business class. With 1.5hr delay we took off for Lima. There was almost no equipment on board which you would expect in a business class. No entertainment in the seats no flight deck information channel. Instead we got an apple IPad with some films on it. Flight information (like distance ETA speed etc) was only available on three fixed screens in the cabin if there were no adds or other films. English newspapers: nothing! All overhead lockers were covered with oily finger/handprints from the mechanics. The excuse was that due to the delay they had no time for a proper hand over and cleaning check. The service itself was very good. All ladies were very engaged did their very best and tried to cope best possible with the lousy hardware. They told me that they have addressed the lack of English newspapers and some other issues many time to the management but obviously they management is resistant to improvements. The return flight was the same just that there were no fingerprints any more. So they found at least time for a proper cleaning. The business lounge in Lima was even worse when it came to service and food offering. I don't know why they can get away with this kind of service in South America and Spain. I hope that this will not be the future business class standard around the world.

We were booked on flight from NYC/JFK to Madrid. We were arriving by connection from San Francisco and were checked through from San Francisco to Madrid by the Air France ticketing agent at SFO. On arriving at JFK we went to the Air Europa gate. There were many other passengers in the same situation as us i.e. arriving from other destinations and taking the JFK to Madrid connection with Air Europa. As boarding commenced many of us were told that Air Europa would no longer accept the boarding pass printed at our point of embarkation and that we would have to get boarding passes reprinted. There were 4 agents at the gate doing nothing. They told us to go outside security to get our boarding passes reprinted and then re-enter. We dozen or so passengers started running for the ticketing counters. When we got there there was a huge line. Only one agent was doing ticketing. Our flight was leaving in 10 minutes so I requested that the agent deal with us dozen passengers. It was clear that since we were all unrelated passengers connecting through JFK from different points of origin that the problem was on Air Europa's side. It is not possible that so many agents in so many different airports for so many different passengers screwed up at the same time. We were all in danger of missing our flight but none of the Air Europa agents could be bothered. They said "Next time you should be more careful to make sure your tickets are correct! Admonishing us as if we were at fault. I looked at the boarding passes we had been given by the ticketing agent in SFO and they looked completely correct. How were we to check if they were "correct"? Finally we were ticketed and we ran to get through security. We had 2 minutes to get through security but the line was 15 minutes long. I went to the line and told the TSA agents about the situation. The TSA agents took the entire group of us and allowed us to go through a fast line in the security. We made the flight but the service we received was extremely rude and unprofessional.

We had booked Air France Toronto to Malaga but the connecting flight Paris to Malaga was with Air Europa. Booked with Premium Economy the seats were uncomfortable. Just before landing I asked when our meal would be served the stewardess very rudely remarked that we were not entitled to a meal When I showed her our ticket she checked her list and there was our names with 'meal' beside it to which she stated 'Well you are sitting in the wrong seats'. We were in fact sitting exactly where we were supposed to according to our boarding pass which they checked on boarding. Thereupon she said "Well it's too late now so what do you want to drink? I asked for a hot drink too late it had to be something cold. First and last for us with this airline!

### Air Europa customer review
The entire service was shoddy and lacked any sort of personal touch or sense of urgency. Some flight crew were pleasant but some just were not. Amongst other things the film selection was poor on the outward bound leg the inward bound was like going back in time! Sharing a screen with fellow passengers and having no control over what you watched and the entertainment is just unacceptable. The controls were temperamental to say the least. I have learned my lesson and I would not fly Air Europa again nor would I recommend their services.

### Air Europa customer review
London to Lima via Madrid and return. The outbound legs were ok. London to Madrid is the same standard as Easyjet or Ryanair (no frills). Their plane from Madrid to Lima was acceptable with seatback TVs but a poor selection of films. The food service was limited to a small meal and water. Any additional food had to be bought. Their plane from Lima to Madrid was terrible however. Reasonably comfortable but no individual entertainment. Just two movies and one TV show for a 12-hour flight. Staff were unpleasant and lied about services. Additional food and drinks were offered when the flight was delayed by 2.5 hours without a reason given. Our bags were not transferred to our connecting flight.

### Air Europa customer review
Return from New York to Madrid. Boarding was chaotic and the flight was late. It cost 2.00 for ear phones and in- flight entertainment was on shared screens every 5 rows with one very poor movie that I could not hear. When myself and people behind me complained the steward said he would try and fix but in the end just ignored it - zero in-flight entertainment! Food was awful i.e. overcooked pasta with some sort of meat in congealed salty gravy with stale bread and for breakfast a tasteless croissant with some processed meat served up with cold tea and warm juice. The air conditioning did not work and there was no individual blower. In complete contrast we travelled from Madrid to New York with Delta and everything about the flight was excellent. Boarding was well organised staff were friendly and attentive the food very tasty the in-flight entertainment with individual interactive screens and free ear phones was superb with a wide choice free on-demand music films TV etc. The seats gave a lot of leg room with excellent air conditioners and individual blowers. What a terrible end to what was a holiday of a lifetime!

### Air Europa customer review
My family traveled recently round trip from New York to Madrid. It was our first time flying Air Europa and this airline was terrible. The boarding process on both ends was nothing more than a stampede toward the gate. They tried calling by row but as people pushed forward they gave up and boarded everyone. The crew was inattentive at best. If you wanted something you had to go interrupt their private conversation in the back of the plane. The food was horrible. They served some hot dog on a pastry thing which was disgusting. The worst part was when we checked in and rather than our reserved seats together we were given middle seats scattered around the plane. When we tried to resolve this through the agent and later a manager the response was basically "tough luck take it or leave it. I would have to be extremely desperate to fly this airline again.

### Air Europa customer review
Business class round-trip JFK-MAD. The bad: their computer systems reservations and website are very deficient compared to other airlines. Not much information or interactive ability available on English Language website (examples: no seat maps no online check in or even online viewing of reservations). Disorganized: the reason I got to fly business on my return was because they lost my reservation (luckily I had my receipt) and I had paid for an exit row seat. The good which over rode the bad: they made things right with my reservations at the ticket counter and bumped me to business on my return flight. The agents on the phone were helpful and the service on the plane and at the counters was excellent and friendly (though not quite as organized as an American carrier). Good food nice planes (A330). Business seat headrests push your head forward though when in upright position which can be uncomfortable.

### Air Europa customer review
I took the JFK to Madrid in Business class - the food was well below average the service was ok the crew did not care about customers and had fun all night on my return flight in the kitchen making the business class customer sleep impossible. On the round trip I had 2 hours delay in NY and 1 hour in Madrid. I was told to be lucky because the day before they had 10 hours delay. On the entertainment side 5 movies which are the same on both legs. I won't fly them again!

### Air Europa customer review
MAD-LIS. I did my check-in passed through security and waited for boarding. I was expecting they would make an announcement for boarding which they didn't. Since I was sitting with my back to the gate I didn't see the boarding and missed my flight. I stayed calm and I was trying to figure out what to do but the boarding agent was very rude instead of helping me reschedule another flight she referred me to the ticket office and I needed to pay another ticket. Instead of flying with this company I bought a ticket with TAP Portugal instead.

### Air Europa customer review
Barcelona to Madrid (evening flight) - apparently it is well-known for the "normal" practice of the Barcelona Barajas Airport to decide how luggage is to be handled on flights and Air Europa is aware of this practice. Once our luggage was checked in with Air Europa they handed over control to the Barcelona Airport personnel. Upon our arrival in Madrid and after waiting for over 1 hour with no one overseeing the luggage area we finally found a company called Ground Works who provided this information about the workings of Barcelona Barajas Airport's working procedures with regard to luggage not arriving with the passenger(s). A total of over 2 hours of sleep lost from that learning experience. Still waiting for communication and luggage!

### Air Europa customer review
PMI-BCN. Fast check-in. 35 min flight without service - as expected. Very comfortable plane arrived on time. Definitely recommended.

### Air Europa customer review
Valencia to Paris in May. The service was very poor and treating the customer as baggage. Boarding time was not accurate and took a very long time to be ready to be push back. The cabin was very dirty and not cleaned. The cabin crew were not willing to serve customer and didn't smile or show any appreciation to the customer.

### Air Europa customer review
Barcelona to Ben-Gurion airport on 16 May 2013 departing Barcelona at 00.35. My wife and I were sat in row 8seats E and F. Duration of the flight was more than 4 hours and cabin staff served passengers more than 3 hours into the flight with cold drinks only and a sandwich. As we were served with cold drinks I asked for a cup of tea I was told there were no hot drinks on this flight. It was very cold in the cabin and passengers asked for blankets which were not available. Not acceptable that no blankets were available during such a flight.

### Air Europa customer review
Yesterday I flew from Malaga to Paris with Air Europa which was a code share with KLM. Being 6'5" does have it's advantages but not when you are flying on a Boeing 737-800 in economy. I know this from several past experiences. That is why I was pleasantly surprised when the customer service agent at the check in counter offered me an extra room exit row seat without me even having to ask. From check in to landing everyone was totally professional and courteous. Nicely done Air Europa.

### Air Europa customer review
We (spouse and myself) used AE for a return trip to Cuba via Madrid. Though in most ways the airline was acceptable rather than good or better the food was unspeakably bad. The evening meal was something that passed for pasta - in truth it was a congealed mess not warm and in no way tasty. Breakfast comprised a box with a roll with a tiny blob of butter and a piece of processed meat thrown in. Completely unacceptable. I will not fly them again.

### Air Europa customer review
I thought this airline was very good. 23kg for luggage so I took some golf clubs. Flight was cheap. The service onboard was limited but it didn't need to be overcomplicated on a 2 hour flight from London to Madrid. Flights were on time and got to the destination a bit early both ways. Luggage was on the conveyor at the other end as soon as I arrived.

### Air Europa customer review
BRU-MAD return flight on E195. Planes are new and clean. Seats comfortable and reasonable leg room. Flights on time. Food for purchase no IFE (which is normal on a 2 hour flight). Flight attendants very nice. Good value for money!

### Air Europa customer review
Gatwick to Lima via Madrid. Everyone of the 4 flights was late with no information given. Because of this I missed a connection for an internal flight and had to buy a new ticket. The food was the worst I have ever come across and I'm not a fussy eater. Top that off with 2.50 Euros for a tiny cup of cheap and nasty coffee. I won't be flying with them again.

LGW-MAD. Flight supposedly on Embraer aircraft but instead on 737. Very good legroom for what is in effect a low cost shuttle flight. Comfy seats. Flight left and arrived on time. Only food available was to buy.

MAD-EZE Airbus A332.Clean aircraft but not much legroom. Flight left 20 mins late but caught up time and arrived on schedule in Buenos Aires. Food OK. Three meals served one of which breakfast was merely a snack. Monitor in my seatback did not work and as the plane was full no chance of moving. Very little "non- Spanish" entertainment played in any case.

London to Gran Canaria via Madrid Business Class. Food was disgusting tiny portions on plastic plates. Worse than economy on most airlines. Service was non existent. This is not a real business class. Never again.

### Air Europa customer review
Amsterdam via Madrid (with transfer) to Punta Cana Dominican Republic and vice versa. Old airplanes. No screens in the headrest in front of you but general screens that didn't all work. The sound didn't work the reading light didn't work the crew decided to switch off the lights (on a day flight). I couldn't read without a reading light I couldn't watch the movie without sound. Bad service no hostess to guide us through Madrid airport for our transfer and very limited legroom. The limit was that we had to pay 20 dollars per person when we were leaving the Dominican Republic. This wasn't at somebody from the Dominican customs but at the desk of Air Europa. When I pay the full price (a lot more than last year when we could fly directly with KLM) I expect good service. Never again!

Flew London - Madrid - Caracas and return. Cheap on time comfortable adequate leg room (I'm 6' 4") but suggest seats B or G on the aisle.

### Air Europa customer review
London Gatwick to Madrid in Oct 2012. Ordered extra legroom seats for 20 euros each way checked in online too. Check-in was quick boarding was on time and took off at the correct time - no delays. Staff onboard were able to speak both Spanish and English and sold a range of snacks drinks and other items - very reasonably priced and able to take credit cards. Flew on a Boeing 737-800 and an Embraer 195 jet aircraft. Flight itself was faultless - very comfortable seating heating in cabin was very good - excellent airline will look forward to flying them again!

### Air Europa customer review
ORY-MAD-ORY. Got upgraded both ways but Business class service rather inconsistent. Outbound B737-800 - cabin too hot comfortable leather seats with decent legroom blocked middle seat. Got some newspapers and a welcome juice in a plastic glass. After takeoff purser offered another juice and some peanuts - and that was it: No meal on a two-hour- flight! Inbound Embraer 195 - I like the 2x2 seating configuration cabin freezing cold. Neither newspapers nor welcome drink. But got a small cold tray as dinner. Cabin crew served some coffee then disappeared until landing. Lounge in MAD fairly spacious - good drink selection but disappointing food offer with only a few nibbles. Ticket fare quite competitive and I appreciated the upgrade gesture - but would definitely not pay for Business class.

### Air Europa customer review
Flew Gatwick to Madrid then Madrid to Lima yesterday and was pleasantly surprised. After reading the reviews below I was expecting a horror story. First flight took off on time. Second flight took off 45 minutes late but landed around 45 minutes early. Seats are comfy enough not amazing. Staff were pleasant. Food was better than a lot of other airlines I have been on. Considering my flight only cost about 580 pounds booked two days before departure I would say it is excellent value for money. Similar fares to Lima were costing around 900 pounds. Perhaps I just got lucky but I would give Air Europa the thumbs up.

### Air Europa customer review
Flying MAD-JFK and back. First flight not bad taking off near the right time flying with a relative comfort and arriving ok. But the way back - the flight supposed to be taking off at 10pm was delayed and delayed and delayed. After 5 hours waiting for any information it was cancelled. The staff were polite but really ineffective. Instead of taking a passenger list and assign them a hotel it was a "first come first served" without any control. Next morning no Air Europa staff appeared. Finally at 3pm a bus took us to the airport. At the airport Air Europa lanes were empty no staff. After half an hour someone appeared. Fortunately we were at the right place and took an advanced place in the lane. Very fortunately because only 30 passengers were assigned a flight that day at 10pm. No additional information for the rest of passengers just lane shut down and good bye. Finally with an additional delay of two hours we left JFK. As a final screw our luggage was not flying with us so we needed to wait additional 24h to have it.

### Air Europa customer review
You really do get what you pay for. They are cheap and that's what you should expect on board. Their boarding desk in JFK is in the back of the airport with no signs to help you locate it. The line is absurdly long and you get the impression when you give them your luggage that you may never see it again. The security check also left a little something to be desired in terms of safety. On board my TV did not work and my chair did not recline. It was a great flight from NY to Madrid! If I was not so cheap I would go elsewhere and will in the future.

### Air Europa customer review
Milan-JFK with a 4-hour layover in Madrid. When I asked to confirm my exit row seats on the Milan-Madrid flight assigned on the phone we were told by the gate agent that we had them - row 9 of the 737. That somehow didn't sound right but two agents couldn't be wrong. Of course these were normal economy seats with the spacious 30-inch pitch that tall people love. Luckily the exit row seats (actually row 14) were open and we grabbed them just when the door closed. On Madrid-JFK leg I had paid for the "extra room" economy seats something I found out was available by chance on the AE web site. But remember that gate agent in Milan who assigned row 9 as exit? She somehow did know enough to recognize that the assigned "extra room" seats were actually a bulkhead row with no extra room. It took several conversations in Madrid to secure actual "extra room" seats which are in fact exit rows on the AirBus. This saved the trip back to JFK from being a miserable disaster. We were lucky I guess that things sort of worked out. But I hate to think how many travellers are victims of a staff that needs to go back to basic training. How does this airline function?

### Air Europa customer review
Flights to Gran Canaria. If you book from the UK and select seats online they won't be there when you get to the airport and you will end up at the back of the plane as we did the connection in Madrid was horrendous and all our liquids including duty free was taken off us because we had to connect by bus in another terminal! The flight to Gran Canaria was good. The return was the same at check-in seats we had booked via the UK were not there we were offered rows at the back of the plane on the flight from Madrid to London the change at Madrid was the same horrendous with lots of furious passengers due to the heat no air conditioning in the transit lounge and very little time to catch the next flight. Planes on all occasions never used a gate once everyone was via bus so the flight time is good but the rest of it was bad. We had 75 minutes to make our connection after we touched down but we were so far away from the terminals by the time we arrived at the plane it was 10 minutes before take off and people were still getting on 15 minutes after we should have taken off - this happened both ways!

### Air Europa customer review
London-Madrid flight with a connection to Caracas on Friday 24/08. Arriving at London Airport Air Europa staff informed us the flight was delayed and they had no additional information. Hours later they inform us that our connection flights will wait for us in Madrid. Arriving at Madrid Air Europa informed us to run to the door and on arrival we were informed that they did not know they had to wait and that we were never on the waiting list which was already full. We had to wait until the next day to take the first flight to Caracas. When we got to the flight they informed us that we had to make a stop on Santiago de Compostela. Arriving in Santiago de Compostela we were asked to get off the plane and were standing on the plane for 20 minutes until they informed that we could not get off the plane. There was no communication Air Europa staff had no information and the only thing they told us was that we made a claim It caused us a big problem to lose a day trip which they never took responsibility. Last time I travel with them.

### Air Europa customer review
Flew from JFK in New York to Madrid. The 10.05 pm flight took off at 2.20 am. Flew from Barcelona to Madrid. The 12.05 pm flight took off at 4 pm and fortunately the 5.35 flight from Madrid to JFK was also about an hour late so we didn't miss our connection. Needless to say the experience was terrible and the on ground support was poor. Nobody could explain the delays or even when the plane would be ready to take off. The messages posted about departures never change so that regardless when the flight boarded and was scheduled to depart only the original information appeared. In addition our dietary requests - made far enough in advance were ignored on the flight to Spain but honored on the return trip.

Missed a connecting flight with Virgin to Havana and Air Europa had the first flight out via Madrid. Unprofessional staff. No information about delays in English. Slowest boarding process I have ever been a part of. Very tight seats no video or custom entertainment (10h day flight).

### Air Europa customer review
You get what you pay for (and sometimes you don't) - they were cheapest across the Atlantic but the seatback video choice was poor and some machines for our party didn't work. But they were the cheapest. When you don't get what you pay for: we booked an Air Europa flight not knowing it was a codeshare flight with Spanair. Spanair went bust on 27 January. We got an email over 4 months later telling us our flight had been cancelled. Unimpressive? I think so.

### Air Europa customer review
London to Miami via Madrid. Long haul leg was awful the plane tatty and the service slow and snappy. An old aircraft with poor entertainment. There did not appear to be enough cabin staff to service the plane size. On our return the airline stranded us in Madrid due to a pilot strike. What was significant here is that it was a weekly regular dispute that the airline knew about but let passengers book and fly then knowingly allow them to become stranded. Worst of all they had made no attempt in Madrid to put staff on to assist inbound customers in Madrid airport. Young families were in floods of tears with Air Europa staff hiding away to avoid facing them. Even if this had not happened to us I would still avoid this airline - the worst I have flown with. Avoid at all cost.

### Air Europa customer review
I read these reviews before I flew and thought that they must be one offs but that was until I experienced an Air Europa flight. Recently flew indirectly to Havana via Madrid. Going out we had a 45minute delay which was nothing compared to what we experienced on the way back. The plane was as expected - not much legroom but comfortable enough for the price paid. Flying back was a disaster - flight from Havana to Madrid was delayed by 6 hours meaning we missed our connecting flight to London. The worst part was not knowing what was going on. Air Europa were unapologetic and couldn't answer our questions about what would happen when we got to Madrid. They did nothing to reassure us and left us feeling completely vulnerable. When we arrived in Madrid a representative told us that the next flight they could get us on would be in 24hours they did offer to put us up in a hotel for the night but we'd had enough by this point and paid 200 euros to get on an EasyJet flight home.

MXP-MAD aboard B737-800 and quite a pleasant experience. Departure on time plane was clean and in good condition cabin crew approach to customers was fair. Prompt baggage delivery. You need to pay for food and drinks in economy including water. The selection of refreshment is however very good and the items are reasonably priced. Seats are rather cramped.

### Air Europa customer review
London-Madrid-Las Palmas. Significant savings being routed via Madrid and very little extra hassle. Airbus 330 looked brand new. Being short-haul there were no inflight snacks and drinks however kids were given an entertaining gift. Both flights on time. The only thing that was very strange was Air Europa's use of the original Madrid Barajas airport. It's a very disjointed terminal you get bussed around clearing immigration having hand luggage re-scanned etc. All in all I would be happy to fly with them again short haul.

### Air Europa customer review
London to Madrid and onto Miami. I was a little nervous as it was our main holiday and we were picking up a cruise ship so didn't want problems the flights were both good and on time 1 hour delay coming home from Madrid good cabin staff clean plane but a bit old still had ash trays in seats. 767 really smooth flights would fly with them again and we had young children with us.

Flight from Paris-Madrid-Buenos Aires return. Paris-Madrid was provided by Air France in codeshare. Good and cheap flights almost on time departure from Madrid 1 hour delayed but made up for lost time and arrived nearly on schedule in B.A. Luggage ok (23kg) food correct free meals and snacks blanket and pillow provided staff efficient plane looked clean. 3€ for the headphones 2€ for travel set.

Just came back from Buenos Aires via Madrid the service provided was ok apart from the seats on the long haul flight being too close together. But that's to be expected with a charter carrier. Will use it again.

### Air Europa customer review
London-Madrid then Madrid-Havana return. All four flights were punctual two arrived early. The London- Madrid plane was new roomy with comfy leather seats. No food but it is a very short flight and no hard sell of their own food/products. The plane to Havana was much older - no TV screens had to purchase (or use own) headphones. Seats were no smaller than other economy seats. It was clean staff friendly and we were given both a meal and a snack and water at no charge. Food was acceptable. Luggage arrived fine. I would have no qualms flying Air Europa again if the schedule suited me better.

### Air Europa customer review
We flew to and from Havana and we're never going to repeat this experience! The seats were worn small and cramped and our legs hit the seat in front for 9 hours! No food except a snack while the rest was meant to be bought. On the return flight we were given the emergency exit seats except that before boarding the hostess called us and told us that those seats they were already taken and she would give us 3 row seats in business class. Well there was no business class and we had the most uncomfortable journey back I ever experienced.

Paris CDG to Malaga. Old plane dirty and service started very late into the flight. Was on 6th row but was out of food when they finally came to my row. Flight crew did not seem to care about passengers. Announcements impossible to understand due to heavy Spanish accent. My luggage was lost and now 14 days later still no suitcase and airline very reluctant to assist.

Flew for the first and last time. Our flight was delayed over 3 hours. We sat onboard for more than an hour without any announcements. The seats were extremely worn and uncomfortable. The floors were dirty with garbage/crumbs. Overall the planes felt old. The flight was overnight and around 3 am all the lights were turned on to serve a meal. I was overall disappointed with this airline and will not fly them again.

ORY-MAD-ORY Economy. Departure from ORY much more convenient than CDG. Both flights on Embraer 195 - clean cabin comfortable leather seats with decent legroom. I like the 2x2 seating configuration. Food and drinks for purchase - pricey but excellent coffee. Lounge in MAD fairly spacious - good drink selection but disappointing food offer with only a few nibbles. On the downside both flights were delayed by one hour with no information or apologies from the crew. Ticket fare quite competitive considering that I booked my daytrip at short notice.

### Air Europa customer review
MIA-BCN changing in Madrid. Knew before flight that it would depart 2.5 hrs late (late incoming flight). Flight itself was smooth (but of course 2.5 hrs late). We were told not to collect our luggage in MAD there was only one harassed and exceedingly slow-moving Air Europa clerk dealing with things. Changed us to a SpanAir flight that we couldn't possibly make had to go back and be assigned a later flight. Of course luggage was nowhere to be seen it finally arrived 3 days later in Barcelona. Staff I dealt with were indifferent. They knew we would miss connecting flight and did nothing about it to prevent days worth of trouble later.

### Air Europa customer review
We checked in online for our flight from JFK to Madrid online check-in went smoothly and we printed our boarding passes. Got to the airport early and since we had no luggage to check we proceeded directly to security. We got through security with no issues and went to the gate and got in line to board. Upon getting to the front of the line we were told we could not get onboard because we didn't check-in at the counter. We said we did online check-in and have boarding passes which say to go to the gate. We proceeded to wait for 45 mins for someone from reservations while the plane continued to board and then left an hour late. The woman from reservations finally came up and said that we had to call their offices to get the flights sorted out. After arguing to see what else they could do we call the number she gave us and there is no one that speaks English. Ending up buying a ticket on Iberia for 6pm Saturday and plan to demand a refund on Monday. Worst airline experience I've had what the point of online check-in if you have to check in again at the counter.

### Air Europa customer review
NYC-Madrid-Lisbon for the first time in Business Class. Surprised and happy at the service and comfort of the plane. Tickets are good value for money. The only down side was the organization at the airport no respect of Business Class line and no one was reinforcing it.

Venice-Madrid-Lima. Business cabin seats not clean - crumbs everywhere. Very uncomfortable seats. Two hour delay outbound one hour delay on return. During meal if you are watching a movie it is interrupted and you are forced to watch a 1 hr p.r. / ad video about Air Europa. Same on connection Madrid-Venice. Business seats are expensive - they should let you watch whatever you want. Socks that airline provide lose their ink all over your feet - very poor quality. On return flight hostesses never came through the cabin offering water - you had to get up and get it yourself. Hostesses took turns sleeping in last row of Business seats.

London to Madrid Madrid to Cancun. On the flight to Cancun Business class was extremely dirty and they lost our suitcase. On return to Madrid was delayed 5 hours meaning missed connection to London. Nobody at Madrid could help us I called the help line but got nowhere. They asked us to clear passport control and leave Terminal 1. At their office only one person was helping a huge line of customers. I ended up buying tickets with easyjet. To be fair there were 3 hostesses who were extremely kind smiling and made our trip less awful.

Well my trip started out with a fabulous connecting flight from Miami to Madrid and then from Madrid to Italy. The attendants were all so courteous like wise on the way the home. Except for the little fact as to they lost my luggage. Now I understand we are all human and luggage does get lost but what I do not understand is why they do not believe in customer service (a.k.a. returning phone calls or being polite). Not only did they just loose my luggage but once they had located it in the Madrid airport they sent it to Miami to be delivered to me that night. Another problem my luggage was never delivered to me as promised. So again more and more calls and still no call back until finally they responded with Ma'am your luggage is in Havana Cuba. The Customer service is awful and I will not fly with them again.

ORY-MAD-ORY Economy. Outbound on modern Embraer 195 - clean cabin comfortable leather seats with decent legroom. Inbound on rather old B737-800 - worn-out synthetic seats greasy windows. Both flights on-time. Informative cockpit crew smiling stewardesses but very slow service. Food and drinks for purchase - a bit pricey excellent coffee. Online check-in works only when departing Spain. Good value for money considering that I booked my daytrip at short notice.

Horrible experience with Air Europa. Barcelona to Madrid connecting to UK. Bag stayed behind in Madrid. Air Europa Customer Service can't get anyone in Madrid to answer the phone! Went on to Dublin. Still no bag. Back now in Barcelona still no bag 13 days later. Initial response was "we have 31 days to return your bag you know! Had to purchase new clothing etc. Never mind essential items some of which cannot be replaced without returning all the way home to the US. Absolutely no concern whatsoever for customer inconvenience. Inept incompetent.

They don't offer online check in (at least not for my flight). Seats were assigned by the time you book the flight. The departure time was brought forward by 15 minutes and I got an email notice few days before travel. Check in was efficient at Gatwick. There were only few passengers in front of the queue. Boarding smooth and no rush. The plane was a E190 – new decent leg room and the service was great. The staff wore a smile and were very patient and friendly. Flight left Gatwick 30 minutes late but arrived pretty on time.

### Air Europa customer review
LPA-SVQ usual unpleasant Spanish ground staff (what's up with them?) but onboard everything fine. Pleasant FAs who carried out proper cabin checks happy to serve and delivered PAs in clear English. Aircraft elderly but cabin clean and tidy. No complaints.

### Air Europa customer review
Even for a low-cost airline Air Europa offers abysmal value for money. I took a flight from Paris to BA via Madrid and back two weeks later. Going out a 10 hour delay at Barajas. We were put up in a hotel for a few hours. Flight out uneventful but service abominable and plane filthy. Food atrocious. Way back a 5 hour delay with no information. Lost connection back to Paris made to pay 130 extra euros to go straight to London as they had also made me lose my eurostar. Told to track down my own luggage sent from one terminal to the next in Barajas for two hours with totally useless staff with contradictory information. In the end I had to board my new flight without my suitcase. Cherry on the cake was when the flight attendant to London told me off for using the bathroom before landing - after she had spent 12 minutes doing her hair in it. This airline is a disgrace at every level and should be shut down. Above all staff training appears non-existent.

### Air Europa customer review
London to Dakar via Madrid and were pleasantly surprised with service and punctuality. We were due to return on 11 May and tried to do an online check in to get boarding passes. We succeeded to get boarding passes for Madrid to London but not the Dakar- Madrid leg. Because we knew that their website was generally dysfunctional we were resigned to show up at the airport in time for the flight. A friend suggested we call Air Europa via his friend at a travel agent. There aren't any telephone numbers shown on the site so it seemed a good idea. Only then did we discover that our flight was cancelled and that we had been transferred onto the Saturday 14th flight. Air Europa said they would not confirm this in writing but said we should just show up. As we are a 4 hour drive to the airport this is an unsettling situation.

LGW- Madrid-Havana return. Check in smooth although got growled at somewhat when asking for an upgrade as on honeymoon. Cabin Staff friendly and efficient. Food no better or worse than other airlines (included in the long haul stretch not the LGW- Madrid part). In-flight entertainment first movie in Spanish only. All in all no problems at all.

### Air Europa customer review
London Gatwick-Madrid Barajas-Buenos Aires return. All flights on time check in efficient and general customer service good. Food provided on long haul crossing was edible if not desirable. Stewards were sullen but not unhelpful and inflight entertainment on the return flight was fantastic though not working properly on the way out. Fantastic value for money and though most certainly not a 5* airline the best deal for a Europe-South America.

### Air Europa customer review
MAD-ATH. Air Europe could easily be named esyjet in terms of inflight service however check in quite efficient. Nothing complimentary on flight got myself sandwich + coke for EUR7 quite reasonable. Will fly again if it is a bargain otherwise AF or LH.

### Air Europa customer review
JFK in business class to Madrid on to Barcelona and back. Seats were not great service was good. Food was average and entertainment TV service was very poor. I was delayed by airport transfer 'Aero city' in reaching to the airport and I was not only not allowed to board and I had to buy one more ticket at a premium but not only was charged for the ticket to go to Madrid but was charged 200 for the connecting flight which I did not miss excuse given was since I missed one leg of my flight I will have to rebook the other one but I was reaching Madrid in time to get my next connection.

### Air Europa customer review
Booked a flight on Air Europa from Miami to Barcelona more than 6 months in advance of our trip departure date. The airline keeps making flight changes and my most recent arrival time in Barcelona is 1 hour before I am scheduled to depart on my cruise - obviously that leaves hardly enough time to get through customs baggage pick up possible flight delays or travel to the port. I am still more than two months away from my departure date but Air Europa is still charging me a $145 change fee + another $200 p/p (there are 4 of us) to change our flight to one day earlier - even though they are the ones that keep changing my arrival time.

### Air Europa customer review
We flew Air Europa from Barcelona to Madrid. The online purchase and seat selection were flawless check in and baggage drop efficient and no line. Because I am a Delta Platinum I was allowed SkyTeam boarding with the business class passengers. Boeing 737-800 was fairly new seating all leather and in perfect condition. Although they charged 2.50 euros for a diet coke service was otherwise good. A great flight overall.

### Air Europa customer review
London to Cuba. We were delayed for an 1.5hrs going out and 3 hrs on the way back. The staff were terrible very poor at communicating and didn't know what was going on. The plane looked pretty tired and seats are pretty uncomfortable (although decent legroom). On the way back Air Europa lost our luggage (we changed at Madrid which was rushed as we were late). The baggage service sorted it out and sent it on to us within 24 hours. Overall Air Europa are cheap but it shows.

### Air Europa customer review
LGW-MAD-HAV return. Check-in at Gatwick very quick and easy. Flights on time. Personal IFE system outbound to Havana - have to pay for earphones but i-pod ones work just as well. Different aircraft on return so just a screen at the front of the cabin but as a night flight wasn't too bothered. Food not great but edible.

### Air Europa customer review
Buenos Aires-LGW. Due to cancelled flight with another airline and missed connection at Buenos Aires we had no alternative but to get back to the UK with Air Europa. Had awful seats 27G/H no window and 24" opposite the toilet. When we arrived onboard there was a notice saying Toilet Out of Order. Phew - at least we won't be bothered by people visiting the loo for a 13 hr flight! How wrong I was. Just before take off a member of staff took down the sign and promptly placed it on the washbasin. In other words the toilet was operable but there was no water to wash hands! The inflight entertainment system was not working so I had to twiddle my thumbs for the whole journey. To occupy my mind I worked out that the number of visits paid to the toilet without water was between 275-300 times! I felt disgusted that people would use a toilet without washing facilities. This should have been closed for health & safety reasons. I mentioned it to the Spanish steward but he didn't think too much about it. I asked why there was no hand antiseptic (like they use in hospitals) but he said "because of no water"! He did not understand what this gel was. One couple even changed their baby's nappy in the toilet. The seats felt uncomfortable with a lack of tilt. The only good thing about the whole flight was the coffee.

### Air Europa customer review
The staff at JFK need to be re-trained a bit in customer relations but onboard treated with professionalism service as good or better than most US airlines. Food in economy was good and it came with free wine or beer. Ground staff in Spain was great.

### Air Europa customer review
Regular flyer on CDG-VLC and ORY-PMI. Air Europa offers good value for money even when booking at short notice. All flights on-time so far seat is assigned at check-in. Informative cockpit crew friendly and smiling stewardesses. Food and drinks for purchase - reasonable prices excellent coffee. On the downside the B737-800 are showing their age - tight seat pitch worn-out seats greasy and dirty windows. Furthermore trying to use online check-in often results in an error message or technical problem. I prefer Air Europa to Iberia for crew friendliness and cheaper fares.

### Air Europa customer review

### Air Europa customer review
Lima - Madrid. I booked a flight with Air Europa to travel to Madrid for a connecting flight to London Stansted. Before we booked this flight I asked the staff in Peru and the staff at Air Europa if there would be any problems in Madrid doing this and were informed by both that provided we had a visa for the country of final destination and a confirmed ticket for my onward connecting flight to the UK. We were not planning on leaving the airport in Madrid there would be no need for a transit visa or a schengen visa. Upon arrival in Lima Airport they refused to board me as they told me I need a visa to change planes in Madrid to the Ryanair flight to London - told me that if I paid them another $148.00 USD in cash they would board me and put me on a connecting flight with Air Europa Iberia or Spanair. I did not have $148.00 USD in cash to give them - I called my fiance and told him and he gave me his Visa card details so we did not lose my flight. They refused to accept the Visa Card payment and would only take a cash payment. The staff at the ticket desk were the rudest people I have ever met. They refused to board me and told me I had lost both my outward and return flights and all my money £700.00 and that their will be no refund. The flight was booked from the UK by my fiance so Air Europa in Peru told me their was nothing they can do. I was unable to take my flight to Madrid and lost Ryanair flights to London. The whole thing has cost over £1000.00 and I was stranded at the Airport with all my bags etc with no money to get home and no flight to the UK for our wedding. We have had to cancel the wedding as we do not have another £1000.00 for me to travel to the UK. Beware before you book flights with Air Europa they are the worst airline we have ever dealt with and have the rudest staff of any airline.

### Air Europa customer review
Worst airline I have ever travelled on. Not enough check in staff 3 hour delay no help in catching the connecting flight. Lost our luggage and still haven't sorted it out a month later - not heard a thing. Flight crew unprofessional and rude aircraft old and filthy food appalling. The after service call centre in Mallorca the worst I have ever dealt with.

### Air Europa customer review
Paris to Madrid economy class aircraft arrived with 1h 45 hour delay at Paris to pick up passengers then we were rushed into the aircraft to avoid the 2 hour delay penalty. Once seated it took an extra 45 minutes to take off as the pilot said it did not have clearance from Madrid control tower. Why rushing the passengers into the airplane then? In the end we landed with almost 3 hour delay no compensation food or drink offered during the flight staff extremely unpleasant and unprofessional chatting loudly between themselves at the back of the plane. The aircraft was dirty it really felt like a very poor airline I would not recommend it at all.

### Air Europa customer review
A very poor airline which offers poor value for money and would certainly not recommend. London-Gatwick to Madrid and back. Check-in is very slow with massive queues at the airport. Boarding ok but could have been much more organised. Their aircraft are a right mess and showing their age very uncomfortable even for a short flight. The cabin crew are not at all good.

### Air Europa customer review
Buenos Aires-Madrid. The original ticket was through Madrid to Rome and I wanted to disembark in Madrid instead of going all the way to Rome for which they charged me EUR 70 but it took them 40 minutes at the check-in to execute it. Nearly missed the flight. The service onboard was very bad and inattentive. Most of ground and onboard staff speaks Spanish and poor English. I had the feeling throughout that they are barely on top of things they are doing so any request a bit out of ordinary causes problems. I had no major issues but overall it was the worst flight I ever had.

### Air Europa customer review
London Gatwick to Buenos Aires (via Madrid) 4.5 hours late with no explanation given at all. Air Europa changed my return flight by 3 hours -again with no explanation. Flight was in the early hours so left in the airport with no ground staff from Air Europa at all. The service is appalling. The planes themselves are not set up for long-haul. Many of the seats do not recline nor do many of the screens for on board entertainment work. You have to pay for headphones or bring your own. The food was beyond awful and the air hosts could not tell me what the food was (it was hard to identify and I am not a meat eater). I was told to 'just try it or leave it not their responsibility to know what the food was'!. For me the most worrying element was the lack of safety. We descended and landed with the air hosts standing up and chatting. Some of the overhead lockers were not shut and passengers were not asked to have seats upright or tables put away. Seat belts were not checked at any point.

### Air Europa customer review
Business class CDG-AGP being the second leg of the flight from NRT. The flight was canceled due to heavy snow. Till here everything understandable. The company didn't offer us business class seats for the flight next day until I complained and made some noise. Air Europa didn't offer us hotel and left us sleeping in the terminal without any support - no hotel no food nothing. The ground staff didn't give us any explanation or made any official announcement - so all passengers running from one side to another. I can understand/accept a flight cancelled by weather but it's unacceptable that they left us hanging in the airport in such conditions. I'm Spanish and I will avoid Air Europa like the plague - not even a low cost company.Old planes old seats everything looking early 90's.

### Air Europa customer review
Paris to Lima in Business because of their unbeatable price and pleasantly surprised by the level of service. CDG-MAD a codeshare by Air France whose Business Class service is below all standards just normal economy. Business lounge in Madrid is very basic but onboard young and cheerful crew who were attentive and smiling. Excellent meals with Spanish flavours and some of their best wines. Comfortable reclining seats allowed a nice sleep. Similarly pleasant experience on the return flight.

Air Europa overbooked the flight and my pregnant wife is now trapped in Argentina and unable to return home for a minimum of 24 hours. Staff are being very unhelpful with arranging alternative flights although other flights are leaving today. Please do not book with this airline.

### Air Europa customer review
Barcelona Miami-Barcelona. Based on a decent experience a year ago flying to Argentina decided to fly them again. Now I regret it. BCN-MIA was uneventful; nothing worth mentioning except confirming what others have already written about their old B767s (old no flight entertainment tight seats etc) - crew did smile at times which made me think that they make an effort to differentiate themselves from Iberia. Flight back a complete nightmare: Completely incompetent check-in staff at MIA airport 1.5 hr delay in Miami late boarding and departure without explanation. Thirsty and hungry passengers had to wait about an additional 1.5hrs after take off to have dinner served as crew were busy with duty free sales. By landing 1 hour late in Madrid a significant portion of passengers lost their connections. About 20 of us were connecting to Barcelona and when arriving to passport control section we were told we needed to pick our baggage (they were supposed to go directly to Barcelona?). With tons of baggage connecting passengers had to stroll through Terminal buildings 1 and 2. When we finally arrived at the customer service center in T2 an airline employee got us all BCN passengers together and told us everything was prepared for us to continue our journey with local low cost carrier Vueling since their next flight wouldn't leave until 9pm. At first this seemed like a decent solution but when I asked her if Vueling would accept our 2+ baggages (based on ticket allowance travelling to US) she hesitated and rushed to call Vueling. When she came back she said the answer was no - since Vueling accepted 1 baggage/20k per person and that either we paid our baggage excess with Vueling or we fly with them 5hrs later. Frustrated we took our chances and gave it a shot at Vueling who thankfully checked in the totality of our baggage without charges and who brought us back home 5 hours later than expected. Next time I will be very willing to pay 100 EUR more to travel with other carriers.

Madrid to Las Palmas. 3 hours delay poor information of what is happening. What upset me most is the fact that there was hardly no information of what is happening and it was only in Spanish. I wouldn't travel with them again. The last drop was when my daughter's suitcase arrived broken as well.

### Air Europa customer review
Madrid to Gatwick 21st November showed up in T-1 in Barajas 2hrs before departure to find a line for check in that in conservative estimates was at least 150 metres long and with at least 600 people. Air Europa has a considerable number of flights to South America all leaving around midday most passengers show up three to four hours ahead of travel. After 1.5 hours we were only halfway through the line I went to the counter to see what they planned only to be dismissed with poor manners. At 20 min. before departure Air Europa started to call all passengers to Gatwick to step forward it turned out that more than one hundred people were in the same predicament they frantically started giving out boarding passes to all involved massive disorganization many highly upset. Needless to say the flight left late never again.

### Air Europa customer review
JFK to Madrid with connection to Venice return via same cities. Plane took off about 2 hours late from JFK but arrived on time with the benefit of a strong tailwind. No explanation for delay provided but once on the ground in Madrid the cabin attendant gave the typical insincere apology for "any inconvenience. The next leg to Venice on time - the only flight segment that was timely. The return to Madrid left Venice about 1.5 hours late and arrived Madrid late by same amount. Madrid to JFK pushed back more than 2 hours late and then immediately halted for a half hour more while mechanics were called on board to fix the air conditioning. We deplaned at JFK 3 hrs late. Again the cabin attendant gave a rote "apology" but no explanation for the delay. Air Europa has no info on its rather primitive web site to inform whether flights are on time or delayed. Delays aside the cabin staff were polite animated and professional except that curiously no one claimed to know anything about the cause of the various delays encountered. This is a Spanish airline and most of the passengers seemed to be Hispanic. Important announcements were given in both Spanish and English but the message was often delivered in heavily accented English. The pilots said little particularly avoiding any discussion of delays. I suspect delays are too sensitive a subject for AE to discuss in a forthright fashion. Check the airline's on time record before buying tickets as I wish I had. Avoid this airline if making onward connections is a critical concern. Passenger comfort in Economy was at the lower end of tolerable. I don't travel enough to make a comparison with other airlines but I'd venture that few airlines afford the economy passenger less seating room than Air Europa if indeed that were even possible. For a relatively new A330-200 the seats didn't return to the upright position without some assistance. Stowed baggage was routed through to the end destinations and arrived without problem. Be careful though at the JFK we were charge $50 for an overweight bag. Next time I'll use something more accurate than the bathroom scale. Food and beverage service were OK. One observation: as the low price leader it's surprising AE has not sought to leverage this advantage by more zealous attention to managing flight delays. If so I would have given higher marks for value. For example they might start by acknowledging a problem exists and that saying nothing won't make it go away. I wish AE good luck but next time I'll pay up to choose a carrier with a better on time record a more informative web site and more seating room.

### Air Europa customer review
MAD-ORY-MAD. Air Europa no longer give access to VIP Lounge to SkyTeam Elite Plus members (Flying Blue Gold Card as well as Platinum) which was a quite negative experience. Boarding was chaotic - ground staff announce the boarding stating boarding priorities (families with children elite plus members then passengers from rows 15 to 30 and then rest of passengers). At this time the queue becomes unmanageable everyone moves without knowing the priority of other (why not create separate lines like AF and IB do). Catering service as in low cost companies (paid) no chance to get emergency exit as they charge like in low cost airlines. Special thanks to Flying Members announced on PA but at this time I really felt that they don't really care about FB members.

### Air Europa customer review
London Gatwick - Madrid - Tenerife North they had the cheapest fare on the route. I checked in with no problems at Gatwick but as soon as I got through security I saw that my flight was delayed by 1.5 hours - could have been communicated at check in. This meant that I would miss my connection. Onboard crew apologised for the delay (which was due to the aircraft waiting for passengers transferring from a delayed Buenos Aires flight - but lots of people on my flight were transferring across Spain and to Caracas and missed their flights.) The seats were comfortable and crew very friendly. On arrival in Madrid people were waiting for us to give new boarding passes. I was put in business class on a Spanair flight 2 hours later and Air Europa paid for a meal and to use their lounge. To top things off Tenerife North was closed due to bad weather and we had to divert to the south airport. All in all it was all very annoying and a long day but Air Europa dealt with everything well and as best as they could.

### Air Europa customer review
LIS-MAD on a regional Embraer aircraft. Economy seating which was only distinguished from business by a curtain (seats exactly the same). Ticket agents were pleasant no line and efficiently provided boarding pass. At the gate agents announced the flight orderly line and boarded the plane from the jetway. Aircraft seemed new seats were somewhat cramped for a 6'1" pax. Refreshments were served. Arrived on time without any delay. Was out of the airport in less than 15 minutes.

### Air Europa customer review
Gatwick-Madrid-Caracas. Overall not very pleasant but if you really need to save the difference in fare go for it. Pre-departure communication is very poor regarding e-tickets check-in etc. Checking in I had no problems having arrived about 1.45 before flight. Gatwick-Madrid was delayed nearly two hours.As a result I had to charge through Madrid airport to my gate where the connection to Caracas was waiting replete with angry Venezuelans. I found the staff very pleasant and accommodating and their English was very good. Food was bad worse than usual. The planes are in a bit of a state with reclining chairs needing to be manually pulled back into upright position that kind of thing. No problems with baggage. Overall I would probably have preferred to pay slightly more for TAP (Portugal) or another established airline.

### Air Europa customer review
Gatwick to Madrid and on to Cancun - flight late only just made connecting flight. Return home economy - worst flight I have ever done. Food inedible no water until two half hours into flight and none until almost landing ten hours later- requests for drinks ignored by very rude staff. All announcements in Spanish and not had a reply to my email complaining.

### Air Europa customer review
London to Caracas and back. Modern aircraft clean and pretty much in working order. Couldn't find cheap flights to CCS until Air Europa flights came up and were significantly better priced than everyone else. Flights between London and Madrid on tiny plane and had to pay for onboard food and drinks but perfectly acceptable. The transatlantic flights were great good leg room decent food and film on demand service (limited choice). Would use them again to get to Latin America.

### Air Europa customer review
A charter flight for Thomson holidays from Humberside to Palma. Flight delayed both ways by around an hour. Inflight announcements from crew totally unintelligible due to heavy Spanish accent and speed of delivery. In flight snack consisted of one small roll with plastic type ham tiny chocolate and half a cup of lukewarm tea or coffee. On our return flight we had an hour of Air Europa promotional adverts on TV all in Spanish - played to an aircraft full of Brits!

### Air Europa customer review
Madrid to Havana on Boeing 767-300: we flew with Air Europa as a result of a missed connection in MAD which prevented us from boarding our original flight. It appears that the airline is reserving its better aircraft for U. destinations and Latin America is treated to what's left. This particular B767 seemed OK at first but the seats are very tight and legroom is insufficient if you're over 180 cm/6 ft. tall. Unlike their A330s the 767 only has a few LCD screens across the cabin and you have to bring your own headphones. Throughout the entire flight the PA system was set to such a low volume that it was impossible to understand anything (even in Spanish as the crew's English was traditionally abysmal). Meals were also lacking - a dash after takeoff 7.5 hours of nothing and a small dry ciabatta just before arrival. Perhaps the worst experience came some 50 minutes into the flight: a girl sitting in front threw up in the aisle and the crew took more than 5 minutes to react making everyone extremely uncomfortable. Their solution was to rinse the carpet with cola cover it with a blanket and spray it with aerosol deodorant. Needless to say this method didn't work for long but nobody else seemed to bother (some hours later a second FA saw the blanket on the floor and assumed the girl's father dropped his so she pick it up and promptly covered him with it). Quite simply Air Europa creates a perfect impression of a Latin American low cost carrier and the passenger structure seemed to correspond. If you're looking for a decent flight to Cuba try someone else.

### Air Europa customer review
I have never had a worse experience with an airline. Due to lack of personnel on the airport the line to check in took at least 3 hrs in London Gatwick. Due to the above we lost our connecting flight in Madrid although we were told by the personnel from the aircraft that it would wait for all of us. They weren't able to find a flight to Cancun from Madrid the same day so we were sent with Mexicana de next day but not without losing one of my bags first. The bag arrived almost 5 days after to my hotel with contents missing. I have filed official claims and sent several emails and I have had no response from Air Europa.

MIA to MAD onto BCN. A330 about 2/3 full with tight seating however we managed to spread out as there were seats available. Dinner and drinks were served. Inflight movies fine a choice of over ten titles along with various documentaries etc in your own in-seat entertainment setup. Don't forget to bring your own earphones or you'll have to purchase theirs. The connection at MAD was quick as bags had been checked all the way through. The second segment a B737 seating tight with food for sale. Coming back all on time with same minimal service standards. However we got the tickets for about 75% of what Iberia or American would charge for the same route and we got what we paid for.

Paris CDG to Valencia. I was upgraded to the tiny Business class. Very small plastic cup of water or juice was offered before departure by smiling stewardess. Drinks arrive with a small meal - everything in plastic. No champagne but cava Cordon nero meaning a better brand than the one sold in Economy. The difference maybe the only one you don't pay for your drinks in Business! A bit disappointing experience.

### Air Europa customer review
My flight was from Moscow to Gran Canaria. Being a member of the SkyTeam Alliance they do not care at all about the business class passengers or about the services both on ground and on board. Moscow to Madrid was operated by Aeroflot. The seats in business class are comfortable in A320 crew is helpful. I checked my luggage to Gran Canaria but noticed it on the belt in Madrid. I have informed airport officials Air Europa representatives about the fact that by mistake my luggage was in Madrid though it should be passed to Gran Canaria. They assured me that in 10 minutes the airport staff will pass my luggage to my next plane. On the boarding gate I have asked to check that my luggage was on board. The representative of Air Europa assured me that the luggage was inside. When I arrived in Gran Canaria - my luggage was not delivered. The investigation revealed that it was still in Madrid. The ridiculous thing is that the situation is being repeated for the second time. Never will use Air Europa any more. Flying Gran Canaria to Barcelona business class the plane is ok crew is rude and not friendly. The food is very slight seats are as in economy class. Barcelona to Moscow the check in procedure is awful. The business class counter did not register business class passengers for Moscow as the flight was operated by Aeroflot.
