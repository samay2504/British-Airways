### "still waiting for the compensation"
Unfortunately is not an airline you can rely on. If you experience a delay, they will ignore every possible way to fulfill their legal obligations. It has been 8 months since I filed support case and I am still waiting for the compensation I am entitled to under EU regulations for a delayed flight. Their team has acknowledged that I qualify for the compensation, but they have done absolutely nothing to resolve the matter. This level of neglect and lack of accountability is unacceptable from an airline that claims to value its customers.

### "finally received our refund"
Avoid SATA Airlines at all costs. We booked a flight from Toronto to Barcelona on SATA through MyTrip on June 18, 2024, to fly on November 4, 2024, arriving in Barcelona on November 5, 2024. It was paid in full immediately at the time of booking. On July 22, 2024, we received a text from SATA that the flight had been re-scheduled for November 5, 2024, arriving in Barcelona on November 6, 2024. No reason was given, but it is assumed that it was done due to a scheduling error by SATA. We contacted SATA to see what they could do for us to make up for their mistake, and they simply and unabashedly told us that, since we had booked through a travel agency, we needed to deal with the travel agency. On July 26, 2024, we asked MyTrip to provide us with a refund for the flight cancelled by SATA. We followed up several times, spending countless hours, to inquire about the refund. At one time, we were told that the request for the refund had been sent to SATA the day we asked for it, and that MyTrip could not issue the refund until SATA approved it. On September 13, 2024, we received an email message from MyTrip confirming that the flight cancellations were confirmed, and that once the airline approved the refund, they would issue the refund. Hmmm... we thought that was done on July 26, 2024, when we first requested it, as they had stated! On October 11, 2024, we received another email message from MyTrip advising that they had processed the refund and that it would take several more days before the credit would show up on our account. Later, on October 11, 2024, we finally received our refund. Total time elapsed from refund request to refund completion - 77 days. Still no apology from either company! Conclusion - these companies charge the full amount for trips months and months down the road. The airline messes up. Rather than issuing a prompt refund with an apology for their mistake, these organizations collude with each other to hold onto the customer's money as long as they can, effectively taking an interest-free loan from the customers shamelessly! Unless you don't mind being taken advantage of like this, I recommend avoiding these two organizations.

### "I received no updates"
SATA delayed my arrival to the point of destination by 9 hours. They adjusted the schedule 7 days before actual departure time, this was not related to weather or anything like this, rather operational reason as I confirmed later with their support. Overall experience with how they handle this situation is frustrating. First of all, they allocated me to the flight which was not the one soonest available in the schedule, but the one later. Secondly, one hour before departure, they informed me that flight won't be the direct one anymore and it will have a technical stop elsewhere, which added an extra time to overall delay. Thirdly, i was never offered any vouchers for meals, i was never asked if I am ok with a new itinerary and so on. I have to call their support, scroll their website to find info. Person on check in counter showed no knowledge and just sent me to the website again. I submitted all the expenses and claim for compensation, but 3 months after I received no updates, not a single word. Contacted support over live chat but the only recommendation was to keep waiting, What a shame!

### “Aircraft very clean and spotless”
Flight was delayed for 1 hr which was communicated via sms prior to departure. Aircraft was a brand new A320 very clean and spotless. Seats are comfortable however the leg room is a bit tight and I am an average 180cm tall. Crew were very friendly and smiling and helpful and served a meal consisting of a sandwich, biscuits, water and coffee which is unusual in European airlines specially on domestic flights and I liked that they still have inflight magazines for people like me who like to read old style. Overall a very nice experience.

### "No entertainment system and no wifi"
Not Verified |   We flew round trip from JFK to Ponta Delgada. Check in and the flight was smooth. The return flight left 5o minutes late but mad up time in the air. The checkin staff and flight attendants were friendly and accommodating. My issues with the airline are as follows:  It is difficult to request a special diet, in our case a vegetarian option. No entertainment system and no wifi. The scheduled evening flight to JFK makes it challenging for onward travel. The seat was very uncomfortable

### "a horrible experience"
Not Verified |   Was a horrible experience. First off you can't even go check your bags till 2 hours before your flight is supposed to leave when they tell you to make sure you are there 2 hours before to make sure you go through customs. Then the women at the check out for some reason weight my personal bag yet there is no limit on personal items and was all around just nasty. Even when you choose your seats they still switch you around! On the flight itself, which was a 7 hour flight, they didn't even have the entertainment systems working. Worst airline I've ever flown with will never again make that mistake

### "Spent 12 hours in airport"
Not Verified |   Spent 12 hours in airport with minimal information as flight cancelled then rebooked then cancelled again. Gate area is like a third world airport with no accurate information and no seating with many sitting in the floor. Would never visit Azores again until they improve their Airline.

### "really good experience"
Another really good experience. First leg - Madeira to Ponta Delgada flight on a Q400 turboprop. Flight left early and arrived early. Polite check in staff in Madeira checked both our carry on and checked luggage all the way to Toronto. OK snack and non alcoholic beverage service on a 2 hour flight. Second leg - Ponta Delgada to Toronto on an Airbus. On time departure and arrival. Good unique Portuguese meal (pasta with tuna, bacon and chorizo), two passes of the beverage cart. Both flights had courteous and professional cabin crew for planes that were full, lots of announcements from the flight deck about possible turbulence. A better entertainment system would have been welcome for the second 6 hour flight.

### "delay of almost 4 hours"
Not Verified |   On 26.10.2023, our flight arrived at its destination with a delay of almost 4 hours. In the event of such inconvenience, they are liable to pay compensation under EU law. I have sent the complaints via their complaint form on their website right after our flight, which they have recorded based on the automatic confirmation emails. The status of the complaints after more than 3 months: "Received/In analysis". The current status of the complaint after 5 months: "Your process is in an unknown state". There is no feedback and no assistance from their side even after two phone calls!

### "book with a different airline"
This is by far the worst airline I have ever dealt with. They changed my flight without any notification whatsoever, to a schedule that guaranteed missing the added connection. I contacted them several times to discuss this matter and they were extremely rude and impatient. They told me they could do nothing to change my flight to something else even though there were other available flights on the same day and I booked the flight through their website, not a 3rd party. They hung up on me upon waiting on hold for 1 hour+ on several occasions. They finally agreed to refund my flight (still after receiving zero notification my flight had been changed and ultimately canceled) but assured me they could not send me any documentation that I would be refunded. The way these people conduct business is extremely unprofessional. I would advise anyone to book with a different airline under all circumstances.

### "Really good from start to finish"
Really good from start to finish. Fast and competent check in at Pearson Airport in Toronto. We requested and they agreed to check our carry-on luggage through to our final destination of Madeira. With December temperatures dropping, a quick de icing was done and we were on our way. Full flight. Surprisingly good airline food beef stew meal with generous pour of wine. Courteous onboard staff. Good announcements from the flight deck. On time arrival in the Azores. The second flight leg from PDL to FNC was an uneventful short 1 1/2 hour flight and a small sandwich with no alcoholic beverages was served. To summarize - safe, on time, good food, good staff and a great price. I have been flying this route for 10 years and have never had a serious problem. Whenever there have been winter weather issues in Canada or fog in the Azores, they have always held the connecting flight and the final delay has never exceeded 30 minutes.

### "The worst experience"
The worst experience I ever had. They take extra bag without to have conditions to take than just to make money and leave the passengers bag behind, the customer service is horrible they just Don’t care about. I been 9 days without any clothes or basic needs. Is frustrated that way they treat customers!

### "Do not fly with SATA"
Not Verified |  They canceled my flight due to "Weather" after waiting in the airport for hours. They rebooked me early next day for 1000 flight. They canceled the flight again. They have us waiting around for 2 hours waiting to maybe get luggage and see about getting rescheduled for a later flight that day. I get to the counter and they schedule me for an 1800 flight for the next day. You serious? I had to pay to change and cancel my other flights to my final destination twice and now I have $1200 that's gone to nothing. I'll have to pay an additional $1100 to get to my final destination. Do not fly with SATA.

### "never fly with SATA Airlines again"
Not Verified |  We will never fly with SATA Airlines again. Due to strong winds our flight was rescheduled several times, which had us wait at the airport for 10 hours before shortly before midnight, it was cancelled all together. There were no flights leaving all day, which meant there were so many people stuck at the airport and all of them had to find a hotel to spend the night suddenly, which made it hard to find something affordable and close by. We ended up spending two extra days at the island because flights on the next days were already fully booked. Talking to customer service in order to reschedule our flights was difficult and very frustrating. We had to pay for a hotel for two more nights, no car, spending a lot more money than we liked to. The two extra days cost us over 460 Euro for the hotel, taxi transfer to the airport, food, additional hygiene products, additional cost for parking at the airport back home. Immediately after we came back, I emailed all the receipts for everything in and that is where the next nightmare began. It is October now and I have not seen one cent back from SATA. It is a constant back and forth of arguing about the things that will be reimbursed. The refuse to pay for the second night at the hotel, they refuse to pay for the additional parking fees, they did not want to pay for one taxi transfer because the taxi driver was an older man and gave us a handwritten receipt missing the date. The customer service is rude, does not confirm received emails and takes forever to reply. Being stuck at an island for two days during storms without a car, missing work days, adjusting the pet sitting service, paying a lot of money out of pocket, spending hours on an overcrowded airport, absolutely ruining the recreational effect a vacation has, was not enough for SATA customer service. They have to argue with customers for over 5 months now to reimburse extra costs that were involuntarily created because of their bad organization.

### "delayed for hours"
Not Verified | Our flight from Ponta Delgada to Lisbon was delayed for hours, causing us to miss our connection in Lisbon to Brussels. They arranged another flight the next day. We did have to look for a hotel ourselves to spend the night. We were told that we could forward the costs of the hotel, dinner and breakfast. I did this immediately. It is now 3 months later and I have not seen a euro back. | Onze vlucht van Ponta Delgada naar Lissabon had uren vertraging waardoor we onze aansluiting in Lissabon naar Brussel misten. Ze regelden de volgende dag een nieuwe vlucht. Wel moesten we zelf op zoek naar een hotel om de nacht te overbruggen. Er werd gezegd dat we de kosten van het hotel, diner en ontbijt mochten doorsturen. Dit heb ik onmiddellijk gedaan. Ondertussen zijn we 3 maanden verder en heb ik nog geen euro teruggezien.

### "I don't know if we'll ever be refunded"
Not Verified |  Flight cancelled. No response calling their customer service line. Operators do not know anything. No response through online chatbot. No response when a complaint filed through their official website (first there was an error and it did not work at all and later we were assigned a registration number but nothing happened afterwards). Then we messaged [email protected] and things started to move very slowly after a month. We have exchanged like 5 messages in total over the past 4 months, SATA even acknowledged our right for compensation, gave us two options to choose from either a bank transfer or a voucher, asked us to fill in and sign some compensation requests which we did instantly and since then they have gone quiet again. I don't know if we'll ever be refunded. Worst communication ever. I do not want to pay an administration fee to a travel company which would undergo the same process as I did. They deliberately avoid these request hoping people are not aware the EU laws or will just forget!

### "expected that I would be entitled to a refund"
I recently had the misfortune of dealing with SATA Airlines, and my experience with their refund policy was nothing short of a nightmare. In fact, I'm not even sure if I can call it a "refund policy" because it seems more like a scheme to withhold passengers' hard-earned money. My ordeal began when I had to cancel my flight due to unforeseen circumstances. I expected that I would be entitled to a refund. However, upon submitting my refund request, I received a prompt denial, with no clear explanation of why my request was turned down. I was left in the dark about why I was denied a refund, and when I tried to seek clarification, their customer service was utterly unhelpful and dismissive. The refund policy of SATA Airlines seems to be designed to protect their interests at the expense of passengers. My experience with their refund policy has left a sour taste in my mouth.

### "highly recommend this airline"
Not Verified |  Both legs were easy, fast check in was fast. Attendants were friendly. Loading was a breeze, even with people cutting in line. We were served free drinks and dinner. On the leg back to Boston I started to get nervous due to 2 flights to New York being backed up. SATA was able to get both flights out and ours to Boston early. Amazing. I would highly recommend this airline.

### "the food is the worst part"
Not Verified |  Horrible company, unorganized, and the food is the worst part, they force you to have one meal option and they don’t give you any other choice. They serve a pork meal which is not enjoyable for a lot of people.

### "Horrible company"
I took 4 flights with this company and 3 of them were late of at least 1 hour. One from Lisbon to Sao Miguel, one from Sao Miguel to Flores, one from Flores to Horta  and the last one from Horta to Lisbon. Horrible company.

### "recommend to avoid this airline"
Not Verified |  The airline changed my flight which meant that I didn't make it to the destination when I was supposed to. A group of 5 other people had to waste a day to wait for me and the holidays were pretty much ruined as we had a well planned itinerary which we could no longer follow. The company refused to talk to the travel agency I used to book the flight and they were not picking up the phone for a very long time - so I spent a day trying to sort it out. Would really recommend to avoid this airline.

### "not a reliable airline"
Not Verified |  Just after passing the security, we heard our flight was cancelled and rescheduled 12 hours later because a bird was stuck in the motor. The alternative they provide for lunch and diner is horrible and there are no decent seats for a rest and where to go with your kids if you had to leave your hotel. We heard from some locals that Sata is not a reliable airline. We were checking the airplane and it is a propeller plane with a very small suction underneath and it makes you wonder how a bird could be in there. I had booked a year before and during that period the flight was changed twice. Maybe that was a warning for this airline.

### " their nonsense refund policies"
I am writing this review after SATA changed its established flight schedule only 5 days before the flight by moving it 2 hours ahead of schedule, making it impossible for our child to make the flight to the Azores, resulting in the loss of over 1000 Euro. In their office they even tried to help us by searching for another flight, but all the flights were full, and finally, our child had to abandon the attempt of coming to the Azores, and for me the total loss of this flight, further related flights, and accommodation money is huge. They offered zero compensation for the loss of this and related flights on SATA. This is simply unacceptable, no insurance will cover such incidents (because the connecting flights for the day of cancelation were on different airlines and purchased separately, and also because insurances are basically a useless waste of money), but there is nothing under the sun that we can do except write this review. I cannot believe that a serious airline would change its well established schedule in the middle of the summer season like this, and offering zero compensation for the loss (yes, I could retrieve exactly 24 Euro, because the ticket was very expensive). The ticket for this flight was purchased months ago, with a very good connecting time at Lisbon, allowing the passenger to change the flight comfortably, but SATA really did not live up to the standard of a serious company. This is really a shame, because our previous 4 flights on Sata, one including the flight from Boston to Terceira, went perfectly well, and we were going to write a good review about that. However, this loss, their nonsense refund policies, and the helplessness we feel at their sudden rescheduling, completely destroyed the good impression we had of them previously. They also destroyed any desire in us to ever revisit the Azores, congratulations SATA.

### "Absolutely horrible experience"
Absolutely horrible experience, not only did they take 200 Euros for two bags they lost the bags and we received them only after 4 days out of a 7-day trip. on the way back they didn't forget to charge us another $200 for the same two bags. Were unwilling to give leg room seats not even with pay to a six 1.92 m tall person. Will try not to fly with them.

### "Everything was bad experience"
Terrible terrible experience. Flying out from Boston on June 5th at 9:45 and was landing at Ilha Terceira, which it wasnt where we supposed to be landed. We supposed to land in Ponta Delaga and our connection flight was at 7:30am. However we didnt land till 8:30 in Ilha Terceira. Then the representatives there told us we couldnt fly out from this island due to the weather inclement. We had lost a day of traveling. The airline representative told us we can get a flight to Lisbon around 12pm or 1pm. By the time we got to Lisbon, there wasn't any flight to go to CDG (Paris) so we had to wait till the next morning for a next flight at 5:50am in the morning. The representative at Lisbon had told us there are no more hotels around the area to accommodate us, and the deal that they gave us is that if we can find any hotel they willing to reimburse us back for up to $80. And now im talking to the airline to get the declaration of delay/cancellation to proof to the claim department that we got delay/cancellation and everything was messed up, they told me I had to paid 20eu in order to get the declaration because im over 15 day of the rules to get the declaration letter. I do not recommend this airline company to fly to europe. Everything was bad experience since we left from Boston.

### "I didn't purchase the insurance"
Not Verified |  I am appalled at the lack of customer service with this airline. I purchased a flight from September 2 to September 13, and received a difficult medical diagnosis which prevents me from travel for quite some time. I realize that I am not able to get a refund and asked if I could receive a travel voucher and extend the trip to one year and be able to use it when I'm well, and they refused to give me any options. I realize I didn't purchase the insurance for the trip, which I wish I had. I even asked if my daughter could go in my place, and they didn't allow a name change with the same last name. All they offered was a refund of $55 for a flight that costs $900! This is beyond unacceptable and I have wasted time calling them long distance as well as emailing back and forth multiple times, and each time, they are offering no options.

### "Very good flight"
Very good flight. New clean Aircraft. Could chose an exit seat 48hours before departure free of charge. In economy a hot meal is included so it’s flying like 20 years ago. Wwould recommend to fly if going to Azores.

### "the worst customer service"
Not Verified | I've given Azores Airlines a 1/10 (as opposed to a 0), simply because they did the bare minimum: they got us to and from locations safely. That said, Azores has the worst customer service that our family has ever encountered. While travelling with an infant (for whom we purchased a seat), our connecting flight was cancelled and we were rescheduled on a flight that would arrive 13+ later than the original flight, and after the hours of our car rental pickup. We stood in a line-up for 2h only to talk to rude, unapologetic agents who were unwilling to do anything for us and then sent us to a SEPARATE line-up to collect food vouchers for the day (vouchers which didn't even cover the cost of a coffee.) After booking a hotel room at our cost so that our son could nap during our long layover, we managed to get on a stand-by flight that was delayed by 2h. Fortunately, we were able to pick up our rental car for an after-hours fee, but our luggage was then lost and we were forced to rent a car-seat for the duration of our trip. Our luggage was found and returned to us, but took 3 days to get to us. We submitted a claim for reimbursement (bare minimum: late charge rental car fee, car seat, diapers and wipes) and were rejected, told that our luggage had arrived the same day as us and was deliverable that day - even though it somehow managed to take 3 days to be delivered. This horrendous experience (all accompanied by an exhausted infant) made worse by the fact that ALL employees, ground and air, were discourteous and insensitive. I would not only NOT recommend this airline. I will do what I can to dissuade others from travelling it.

### "bid on an upgrade to business class"
This was my first visit to the Azores and I was pleased to find direct flights to and from Ponta Delgada from Toronto. Friendly, gracious, efficient crew from checkin desk to onboard service, the A321 aircraft looked quite new and clean. A nice meal of quality Azorian food. I was offered the opportunity to bid on an upgrade to business class and took the opportunity to do so. I received the upgrade at reasonable cost and enjoyed the lovely spacious reclining seats and leg rests as well as the lovely meal service. This airline does a great job. I will be looking forward to visiting the beautiful Azores many times in future and enjoy the great service of Sata Azores Airline again.

### "A really good experience"
A really good experience from start to finish. The staff at the Azores Airlines office in Toronto were polite and efficient and did a great job of booking our flights and advising us and making a small adjustment when the schedules changed. Then, in the midst of horrible Christmas weather causing continent wide flight disruptions, we had a surprisingly positive check in experience at Toronto Pearson - 25 minutes in total from entering the airport (total chaos inside with other airlines) until our first glass of wine after security. The first flight left Toronto about 1 hour late but the connecting flight in Ponta Delgada, Azores was held and we arrived in Madeira about 30 minutes late. A nice touch - when we landed in the Azores it was pouring rain so, instead of the usual 200 foot outside walk to the terminal, Azores Airlines provided a covered staircase and a bus, limiting our exposure to the outside weather to no more than 5 feet. In addition to our checked luggage, the SATA Azores Airlines check in staff were happy to put our carry on bags in the hold all the way to Madeira at no additional cost so we carried only our one personal item. On board staff were friendly and courteous and advised us of progress. Food on board all flights was OK. We have been flying this route for 10 years now and, despite weather and small fleet challenges, we have never had a bad experience similar to what other reviewers have had.

### "no digital trace of our luggage"
Not my first flight, unfortunately not my last either. Flight was scheduled le leave at 20:25. Flight S40322 Dec 16/22. I arrived 3 hours ahead to the check in counter. 1st strike I was pretty much requested to check in my carry on leaving me with my small back pack. I accepted hesitantly as I always pack my small carry on for 3 days. My meds, supplements, some personal hygiene, an extra set of clothes. Cleared security. Got to the gate, 1 hour later we were advised the flight is delayed. Fair enough. A second announcement was for a boarding gate change. From b41, to b40. Another hour, flight is delayed. A 4 announcement another boarding gate change to b38. Was mention it was the requested by the airport . 2.5 hours later boarding begins. Ufff happy of course to get on the plane. Departure is 2.5 hours late. Probably one of the most uncomfortable flights I’ve taken in a long time. We arrive in Ponta Delgada. Late, I missed my connection. I had to take my 3 bags, 2 x 23 kg, plus my carry on. The carousel stops. No bags. There are 20 people waiting for bags, parents with kids several with connections like me. All of us at the counter filling out our missing luggage claims. The agent could tell us nothing as there was no digital trace of our luggage. I get out and make my way to the ticket counter to get my new boarding pass. I board my new flight with not one personal item but my laptop, and 3 other pieces of electronics. That is now 36 hours since I left from Montreal with Flair. An amazing discount airline that puts SATA to shame. I arrive in Terceira. Since Sunday morning I’m relentless to find any information possible. Nobody answers the phone, one the line is always busy. The lost and found in Toronto you can’t leave a message as the mailbox is full. I communicate with Sata on Facebook explain the situation. They reply, send an email to this email. I did, it’s now Tuesday evening local Azores time. I have not received a call back, or a reply to my email. For me, it’s sad as I’m to stay three weeks then travel to Thaïland for 4 months. I have business there and everything in my bags I need for here now, and the rest of my travel plans. So customer service where are you. You obviously don’t care about anybody. This downright ridiculous that so many passengers on the same flight have all their luggage missing. The missing flight I can deal with. But nothing else but my little back pack. I cannot accept. This is unacceptable that 4 days later there is not a digital trace of luggage. With all this high tech we have. I just need my bags back. Otherwise my plans for Thaïland will be scrapped and my businesses will suffer the most.

### "They rescheduled my flight"
They rescheduled my flight by making it longer by 15 hours! They did the last day so I didn't have any other options. I couldn't check in online or via phone. So had to arrive at the airport super early. No TSA precheck either! Waited in a really long line.

### "was pleasantly surprised"
Wasn’t feeling very confident flying with the airline due to the reviews, but was pleasantly surprised. Crew was professional and courteous. Food on both legs was surprisingly good and there were several options for drinks. Really short transfer at PDL which went by seamlessly. However, the seats are not very comfortable and the wifi connectivity only provides you with access to their IFE portal which has a limited but decent quality selection. Considering this is a relative small airline based in an archipelago in the middle of the ocean, I appreciate the fact that it’s not a no frills experience. Would definitely fly with them again as someone who really wants to visit the Azores.

### "Great Staff in flight"
Not Verified |  Great Staff in flight, really nice with children. Ground service really friendly in Lisbon. Pleasant flight with a lot of information during the flight.

### "Unbelievably bad"
Unbelievably bad. Communication dramatic. There was no communication between the transfer where you have to hope to reach your plane. Transfers from Amsterdam to Azores are not met all the time which resulted in continue missed flights.

### "The worst nightmare airline"
The worst nightmare airline. My original flight supposed to airtime Lisbon at 11am 24 June but flight was delayed 2hrs from New York to Ponta so I arrived at Ponta 9:30am, staff had no provide any ticket to Lisbon as actually SATA Air Azores flight was delayed but we all customers need to get to the checking buy new tickets to Lisbon. First Lady staff put us in the latest flight at 9:30pm so arrival time will be 12pm. We fight for customer right with SATA Air Azores staff on Ponta during 3hrs there till we get the new flight from 9:30pm Change to 7:20pm and third time with afternoon staff they change our flight to 3:15 pm arrival Lisbon at 6:30pm. Another nightmare when we arrived Lisbon airport during the plane landing I can saw my luggage sitting on the runway wait for me. Because my original flight was canceled but I assume my bag was delivered to Lisbon airport earlier than my actual flight 3:15pm. I waited for 2hrs till 10pm without any baggage staff/airport staff/airline staff support or help. No one care about customers issues in Lisbon airport. And I need to leave the airport to check in my room with Airbnb because it already night time at 10:30pm must checkin the room. The next day I tried to message to SATA Air Azores, ground force lisbon and also phone called but no one can help us. So I decided to go back to airport and finally get in the long line to groundforce staff that they just open the baggage claim for us after we were argued with staff again and we talked with the SATA Air Azores supervisor to discussed with groundforce staff just for open the baggage claim which is they are the one who lost and never return my baggage. I showed him photo of my baggage sitting in Run way and of cause I smart enough to take a photo to have my evidence proof. But again groundforce staff not listening and not even asked for my baggage photo to put in system to help the team to find and track back of my baggage. It’s been 3 days my vacation with my husband in Lisbon had nothing here we did not visit anywhere because all day we were tried to contact with airport and airline about our lost baggage.

### "do not get any upgrades with them"
I had to change my original flight due to a cancellation from WPB to Boston on a separate airline. At that point I called the main number to rebook for another date, They were accommodating and helpful. When we checked in our luggage they wanted to charge us for the extra that we had already paid for in advance because the attendant did no see a record of the pre-paid baggage, of course at that point we just paid for it again which cost us an additional $160…also originally we had paid for seat upgrade $60 each (2). Did not want to argue or dispute at that moment but visited the Sata agency in Ponta Delgada to tell them what happened, needless to say this was a long visit, back and forth with supervisors, needed to verify my ticket stubs and they wanted the actual baggage tickets to verify all of this. Needless to say this went on for over 1 month and they would not refund the upgrade in seats that we originally paid for and that someone else paid so Sata made out with the price of these seats, and if this happened to us most likely it has happened to many more people. They did however refund for the extra luggage that we had already paid for. Moral of the story do not get any upgrades with them and make sure you get printed receipts for everything you purchase…they are not a responsible airlines and take no responsibility for their actions! I fly with them as there are no other options in the Azores, but as soon as there are other airlines flying between islands or Boston to Azores they will loose a customer.

### "a very pleasant experience"
Not Verified |  Trip to Azores - flights LIS-PDL and PIX-LIS booked with TAP but operated by Air Azores. In opposite to TAP, Air Azores reminded me of the "good old days". Seats well padded, enough legroom, possible to recline and even a small head rest which made it easier to take a nap. Passengers were provided with a small box containing a sandwich, made of special Azorean bread, some cookies and non alcoholic drinks for free. Our junior even got a special box with an extra chocolate in it. All in all a very pleasant experience.

### "No refunds, just a credit"
The customer service is just out of this world - so rude! I called them 3 times to make changes or just check on my options. They treat me as they are doing me a favor, what happened to a normal polite conversation? The last lady was annoyed with me as I was checking on options to cancel my flight. Do not use them unless absolutely necessary. No refunds, just a credit but can only be used for the ticket that cost the same or more. My new ticket was $100+ less and they wont do it.

### "the worst airline I have ever flown"
Not Verified |  We have been flying to the Azores yearly for the past 20 plus years and if there was any other choice I would never fly with this company. There are so many situations that I could write a book. They run late, disorganized and in general the worst airline I have ever flown. Just this trip, they left late, took a very long time to load the plane, had us packed in the stairwell for over 15 min, not optimal with Covid, very poor meal, lost one of our bags, lost our connection and caused us to have an 8 hr layover after flying for 13 plus hours not including airport time. Only offered snacks while we waited.

### "Worst flight I have ever taken"
Not Verified |  The plane was very hot, the flight attendants were rude and confrontational. They wouldn’t serve drinks or dinner because they said to much turbulence but there was hardly any. Finally after about 4 hours they served us a Dixie cup of water. If you got up to go to the bathroom they yelled at you to get back to your seat. Worst flight I have ever taken.

### "The customer service was terrible"
We booked with 2 bicycles to go to Europe. It clearly says in plain English under the bicycle section on their website that if you take a bicycle you get an additional 10kg of luggage on top of your 23kg standard. When we went to check in with our 33kg bikes all packed and secured inside a bike box with our cycling gear padded around them we were told that we must have two separate bags, one of 23kg and a different bag of 10kg. I explained to them that not only did it not mention this specific on their website, but it takes a long time to properly pack a bike box and so it is not damaged in transit. They wouldn’t budge and we had to quickly try and repack the bikes into 2x separate ones before they closed the check in. It was super stressful and the bikes were now loose and getting bumped around in the box. The customer service was terrible and if my bike arrived broken it will be 100% their fault. So dissatisfied with this airline.

### "I wouldn't recommend the airline"
I wouldn't recommend the airline at all. We experienced a delay of more than 6 hours without notification and without giving regular updates. Also the airline lack basic service that you would normally find even in the low cost companies. We have booked through SATA because it has a monopoly for now of direct flight from Paris to Azores.

### "the best customer service"
Fantastic airline, with the best customer service ever! I had to change my travel plan at the last moment, I call the customer care and they change all my flights between the islands without charging anything. It took few minutes, I received the new flight plans immediately.

### "airline is just very unprofessional"
Not Verified |  This airline is just very unprofessional and just has horrible communication. My flight was canceled the day of the flight 4 hours the scheduled time. I am traveling with family and this was very difficult for all of us to relocate to another island and re-arrange our schedules/ work schedules. We were told it was due to “bad weather” but every other flight was able to fly and get to their destinations. On top of it all the flight attendants are just very rude. I hope to never fly with them again respectfully.

### "a nightmare to deal with"
It's a nightmare to deal with the customer service, they lied about the information about my trip, and try to get a refund they wanted to charge more for their pocket, and I'm sure they do this to other people. Thank God I had proof to back up my situation, lets make sure they treat people with respect, dignity, and honesty.

### "Worst customer service ever"
Worst customer service ever. Flight has been cancelled 3 times so far and was never offered a refund as per EU regulations, got pushed into accepting a voucher, and now that I am demanding a refund after going through 18 months of cancellations they are telling me because I accepted a voucher they cannot give a refund. They do what they want with you. This will be the last time I ever fly with Sata.

### "Horrible experience"
Lisbon to Toronto. I came to the airport to go to Canada with all my documents I needed to prove my Working Holiday Visa. At the counter for check-in bags lady didn’t want to take my suitcase saying I can not enter Canada without return ticket. I tried politely to explain there is no need to have a return ticket if you have proof of funds that state you are able to purchase a ticket. That is written in Canadian Goverment official site (https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/work-canada/iec/prepare-arrival.html). The lady wanted to cancel my flight and then I spoke with the supervisor whom I had to explain and show where this information are represented. After an hour of arguing they gave me boarding tickets saying I will be in the same consideration when I come to the gate and the flight was in 15 minutes. Luckily nobody at the gate checked anything except my boarding pass but I was in fear what will happen in connection flight in Azores. I arrived to Canada and I was eligible to enter with documentation I presented also to SATA where I was almost rejected. How can policies from airline company be different than Canadian goverment? Horrible experience and hopefully my journey won’t cross with this airline anymore.

### "I am beyond angry!"
Toronto to Funchal via Ponta Delgada. I am beyond angry! First time customer to SATA, and will be the last time ever. we booked Sao Miguel + Madeira 11 day vacation through Azores Getaway for Christmas and New Year holidays. The flight from Toronto to Sao Miguel on Dec 21st. Was delayed for 7 hours. Of course we didn’t find out until after arrived to Toronto airport at 5:30 PM. Too late to drive back to Ottawa. Stayed at the airport for 10 hours and we really tired and cold overnight. This was only the beginning of the nightmare. On Dec. 24th, Christmas eve, our flight from Ponta Delgada to Funchal was delayed again by 10 hours. We missed our paid rental car because the rental car office closed at 9 PM at Funchal. The SATA airline staff told us to take a taxi and get reimburse later. We did exactly that, and emailed the receipts to the provided email address. Guess what? The taxi fare was 23.5 Euro but SATA can only pay 10 Euro based on their rules. We never wanted a free taxi from SATA. We paid for our rental car already but we couldn’t get the car because of the delay. We missed our Christmas eve dinner. We had to take taxi again on Chrismas day to the airport again to get the rental car. What we have done to deserve that? we didn’t even choose SATA on our own as we didn’t know which airline Azores Getaway would use for the vacation package. I am too angry to write more for now. But I will later. It is not about the money anymore.

### "one choice meal with wine"
Continues to remain the best value by far. Efficient, friendly check in at YYZ with one small snag. Our no-charge pre-selected seats were changed for load balancing purposes on an A321 that was only about 70% full. YYZ-PDL. We were delayed leaving Toronto 30 minutes because of fog at Ponta Delgadap in the Azores but caught up 15 minutes en route. Plane was newish and clean. No built in entertainment system. Full service, one choice meal with wine was served on a 5.5 hr flight. PDL-FNC. The second leg was on an older Q400 turboprop. On time departure from Ponta Delgada and arrival in Madeira. Polite service with sandwich snack and non alcohol service. When we landed in Madeira, the curious requirement to get from the plane to the terminal using a bus - maybe 100 metres - meant that our luggage arrived for pick up at the same time we did!

### "never fly this airline again"
Terceira to Boston, We've been delayed for over 4 hours with no update. The plane is here in Terceira sitting in the runway. No update. No food. No drink. The only cafe will only take cash, no card. There's not an ATM in this airport, so unless you have cash you're out of luck. I'll never fly this airline again.

### "left to figure out what to do next"
Boston to Terceria. This airline operates in an area where the weather is particularly difficult to navigate. Even with this being a common occurrence, they seem to have very little functional protocol in place for helping customers or staff find streamlined solutions. Our flight was unable to land due to weather, which meant rerouting more than 2 hours away. I was not upset about this, safety was most important. But there was nothing in place to help us know how to navigate the process of getting to our original destination. The captain and crew thanked us for flying like it was just a normal flight and we were left to figure out what to do next. No instructions were given, no directions to the airline desk, once we finally found airport staff to help guide us to the Sata counter, many of us waited in line for more than 4 hours with a blindsided staff getting mixed messages from management. New boarding passes were given then canceled, offers for local hotel and flying out the next day were offered then canceled .. many of us were put on a flight that had two more stops, the last one still not our original destination. Another long wait in lines until after midnight. This company needs some training on how to operate professionally. I feel terrible for their staff having to face so many weary, angry travelers with no workable options for making things right in anything barely reaching a timely manner.

### "more compensation is necessary"
Not Verified |  We had a flight booked Business Class from Toronto to Las Palmas. The day of the flight we received a call at 9:45am telling us our flight was cancelled due to a strike. They attempted to book us economy until I insisted that wasn’t right. They booked us on TAP Portugal to Lisbon for two days. We have paid for a beautiful hotel in Gran Canaria and are not able to use two days of it. The airline gave us two $15 airport food vouchers and that was it. I called when we landed in Lisbon to find out which hotel we would be staying at only to find out we have to find our own but they only pay 80 euros a day (not quite the same as we have sitting empty in Gran Canaria). I think more compensation is necessary and will be pursuing once we get home.

### "worst airline I have ever flown"
Lisbon to Toronto via Ponta Delgada. This was the worst airline I have ever flown. It must have low priority as the taxi rides and bus rides to the runways are long and times do not seem to be factored into the flight schedule. All flights were late. There was zero communication from staff. Upon asking we were told different answers by different staff. From the time of booking (four months early) we attempted to be seated together, and then each subsequent time, without success. There is ZERO entertainment on board - not even a screen to monitor the flight progress (and no announcements). The entire crew sat in the back row and chatted for the full 6 hours. At the connection we were kept in a small security room with far too many people for longer than was expected without access to any services. I had been told I could not bring duty free from Lisbon to Ponta Delgada but that I could purchase it there. Upon arrival there I was told the kiosk would open. It did not and we were stuck without any entertainment for the 2++ hour wait and the 6 hour flight. There were many children on board and they were allowed to join their friends and share seats (even when the seatbelt sign was on) Best of all, the dinner "service" was one hour into the flight. They ran out of wine before it completed (not even available to purchase). In Portugal! Mickey Mouse Air.

### "Professional cabin crew"
Funchal to Ponta Delgada. Half of the passengers got through the gate & on to the bus, then we had to go back to the terminal and start boarding again 15 minutes later. Finally we were on our way 45 minutes delayed. Flight on a Q400 they offered sandwiches with cookie and drinks and wine. Professional cabin crew.

### "Zero help from SATA"
Do not recommend this airline as their service is terrible. We flew Ponta Delgada to Lisbon and had connection in Lisbon with KLM. Ticket was sold with connection. When we tried to check in luggage all the way to Amsterdam it was refused even though SATA does have interline agreement with KLM. As result of it we had to recheck luggage in Lisbon. Flight was delayed, took 25 min. for luggage to arrive in Lisbin, check in desk was closed by the time we arrived to recheck luggage. Missed connecting flight just because luggage was not checked all the way. Zero help from SATA, sent complain letter to them , after more than a month none reaction. Use TAP as they more flexible than SATA.

### "disappointed with the service"
Not Verified |  Fake advertisement of the ability to purchase additional baggage. 15 euros per kg. When I had originally purchased the ticket, it was made clear on the website that I would be able to purchase additional baggage. Today I was trying to complete my check-in and purchase the extra luggage however the website did not allow this option, I therefore rung the contact number available on the website to make the purchase and to my surprise was told that I could purchase the extra baggage only once I arrive at the airport, only after questioning the lady on the phone, I was told that in fact I could not take an extra suitcase but only pay for extra kilos in the luggage which I already have (£15 per kilo from the suitcase I already have). Unfortunately, I have already brought and paid for an extra suitcase from London to Lisbon with the expectation that I would be able to take it to Cape Verde. Im highly disappointed with the service I have received thus far, I usually take this trip with TAP however decided to try something new and now I am being charged an additional £450 for a suitcase. This was extremely unclear across the website and now I have no choice but to throw away my suitcase with all my belongings as the price of this was not advertised.

### "flight to Boston cancelled"
Terrible airline. Our flight from Ponta Delgada to Boston cancelled due to plane issues in Boston. We were told that we needed to stay in line until they wrote on names and phone number on a piece of paper then told to leave airport and they would contact us when our new flight would be booked. Waited 24hrs without a call had to return to airport to try to get answers and let them know that 2 of the 4 in my group were diabetic without any more medication due to cancellation. They didn’t care at all, I had to plea with them to finally get on the plane Monday night from Saturday original flightt. We were not given any compensation for hotels food etc. Cost us in 2 days of hotels additional $400.00

### "experience was terrible"
Ponta Delgada to Toronto. The worse flight and airline I have taken in my extensive 43 years of extensive travel. A 2 hour delay became almost a 6 hour delay in total between issues with crew, boarding, gate availability and more. The food was horrible, the crew were rude and the experience was terrible. On top of everything we are still on the plane after landing 45 minutes ago as we taxiing from gate to gate being told that there are issues (on our way to our 3rd gate now). I don’t understand how an airline can be so poorly run and how they coordinate so poorly with it’s crew. I don’t blame SATA for the gate issues (thank you Pearson airport) but everything else has been their fault. It’s 2019, all other airlines are doing better than you. Glad there’s more competition to the Azores. Stay away from SATA

### "Do not trust this airline"
Not Verified |  Ponta Delgada to Lisbon. Do not trust this airline. My husband and I booked our trip to the Azores, from there we booked a flight from the Azores to Lisbon Portugal. We booked our flight with SATA airlines. We arrived at the airport to catch our flight to Lisbon only to receive an SMS text saying our flight was cancelled and we were being put on a flight 7 hours later than. Not only did they put us on the last flight of the day to Lisbon but they wouldn’t even put us on any waiting lists for earlier flights. We lost a day of our vacation thanks to SATA. Do not book or put your trust in them.

### "option to fly middle row economy"
Flight cancelled but not told about it until I showed up at the airport even though they had my cell number and email address. I was sent to a very long ground service line staffed by one person. Despite holding a business class ticket out of Delgada to Boston, I was only given the option to fly middle row economy in the back of the plane on a United flight through Newark 25 hrs after my original booking getting in to Boston 30hrs later than my original ticket. They put me up in the 69 euro/ night airport hotel in Porto for 24hrs. Despite asking, no compensation for the difference in price of the business class ticket. I paid an additional $244 to United to upgrade the seat to economy plus as I am very tall and find United economy seats painfully short of leg room.

### "refuse to give compensation"
Terceira to Lisbon, cancel the flight and refuse to give compensation according to EU law. They refuse to take responsibility and lie to you. Perfect example how an airline should not be run.

### "better leg room than some"
Not Verified |  I was concerned when I read so many poor reviews but if anything it prepared me for the worst which did not happen. Flight was on time. Check in a breeze. Plane was spotless and better leg room than some airlines. I never expect fine dining on planes so I prepare by bringing some snacks. In saying that - the food was fine. And they refilled your wine or beer free. I also downloaded some movies on my iPad so we had our own entertainment - perfect. Coming back the flight was delayed an hour due to an issue with the incoming Toronto flight so you can’t do anything about that. They contacted me on my phone to advise me if the delay. All n all a very good flight!

### "canceled our tickets"
Ponta Delgada to Ile de Terceira. A deplorable company, which canceled our tickets without telling us (not an email, not a message), then resell them and tell us the day of boarding that the plane is full. A contemptuous customer contact, no help, no advice, no refund proposal. This setback has made us miss a match in Terceira and another in Lisbon. Today, after making us lose a fortune in airline tickets, the customer service of SATA turns a deaf ear, but we have not finished with them.

### "Worthless customer service"
Terceira to Ponta Delgada. After a delay on Terceira we were stuck for 7 hours. Our vacation was seven hours short because of the delay. According to European law you should receive compensation for this. After 5 months I only received an email back from the airline with just an excuse. I transferred the further mail changes to the travel agency where we had booked our vacation, but the airline still refuses (after 7 months) to pay for our vacation loss. Worthless customer service that can only be reached by e-mail.

### "Cabin crews were efficient"
FNC-PDL-YYZ, May 1 2019. A Great Experience. Easy online check in, friendly baggage drop off at Madeira airport where flight left early. Airbus 320 and 321 planes on both segments were clean. Cabin crews were efficient and cared about all passengers. Lunch service on the first 2 hour segment included an OK sandwich and a generous pour of wine! Dinner service on the FNC-YYZ segment - including more good Portuguese wine - was better than previous flights I have taken with Azores. Flight deck announcements were complete and non intrusive. Inflight entertainment which is available only through a downloadable app could be improved. In short, I am a fan of this small airline. I also respect the reviews of customers that point out when things fall off the rails they really fall off! However, in my personal experience over the years of flying in the winter months with Azores, there have been weather delays but connecting flights have been held and there have been no serious screw ups.

### "experience was a rather good"
Toronto to Lisbon. My experience was a rather good one. Flights were on time, the food was decent, there was enough leg room for my 5'11 self. The only issue I had was trying to get in touch with customer support (which I never managed to do via phone) but they were able to fix my issue at the gate so all was well. I would recommend SATA Azores  to any travelers on a budget.

### "22 hours of layovers"
Boston to Ponta Delgada. Worst experience of my life, bought this ticket because it was the quickest route, they have canceled/changed my flight 4 times in the first 5 hours of travel. My flight will now be a total of 12 hours flying 22 hours of layovers. The staff at the check in is rude and no one answers their contact phone number. I’m trying to work with my credit card to get the cost of the return flight canceled but I think I’m just going to buy a ticket from a reputable airline and cut my losses.

### "crew was friendly"
YYZ-PDL-FNC. Easy on line check in and baggage drop at Pearson airport. The first leg on a new Airbus was 30 minutes late leaving and arriving but we caught up on the second leg and landed in Madeira on time. The connecting flight was on an old reliable Q400 turboprop. Both flights were full but crew was friendly and the meals were edible. Planes were clean. On the PDL-FNC leg, they even gave out celebratory pastries called malassadas as a pre Carnival treat.

### "staff were great"
Terceira to Lisboa. The flight departed a bit late, thus arriving 15 minutes late. No explanation or apologies offered. Still, the service was very good, staff were great, even when dealing with a medical emergency on board.

### "flight was uneventful"
Santa Maria to Ponta Delgada. My first inter island flight. Boarding went well, staff were nice. The flight was uneventful, taking only 20 minutes. I would advise to ensure that flight magazines are well kept and not torn apart.

### "nice and helpful"
Ponta Delgada to Terceira. We were told to board and, while in the queue, were advised that there was an issue with the plane. Everyone was sent back to sit, but were kept informed. The plane was some 20 minutes late. Staff were very nice and helpful.

### "Flight was good"
Lisbon to Santa Maria. My friend got an alert saying the flight was delayed, but I didn’t get anything. Later she got another alert saying the flight was back on time. The aircraft and crew were not SATA, but were professional and polite. Flight was good and a snack is provided.

### "not ignore the mistreatment"
On 26th December I took a flight from Toronto with connecting flights in Porta Del Gado and Lisbon and a final destination of Seville, Spain. Unfortunately the Azores flight from Ponta Del Gado to Lisbon was delayed due to operational technicalities within the Lisbon airport, backing up the airport for most of the day. As a result I arrived in Lisbon minutes before the initial scheduled boarding for my next TAP flight was set to take place, fearful that I would miss it. I received a text message to my phone from Azores Airlines stating that my next flight had been delayed itself over one hour, however, given the timing, I was still cutting it close. Upon arriving at my TAP boarding gate I was made aware that the flight I was set to take next was indeed delayed two hours itself, meaning that I had made it in time and would be able to fly out shortly. After getting to the front of the line awaiting to board, the TAP attendant told me, quite matter of factly, that my ticket had been sold due to my past flights delay, and that my next flight would not be for another 10 hours. Naturally I was shocked, and disappointed not only to spend 10 additional hours in the airport, but for the fact that my plans made in Spain would not take place, losing an entire day of travel. Upon pleading with the attendee she told me that it wasn't her dilemma, offering no consolation and asking me to take it up with the Azores officials, as it was not a TAP issue that my ticket was given away. I then tracked down the Azores customer service department. They told me they were sorry for what had happened, however there was nothing they could do, seemingly confused with the events that had taken place. The representative told me all they could offer me at that moment was two 10 Euro vouchers for lunch and dinner at the airport. I found this an incredible lack of compensation given the loss of a day of travel, 10 hours spent in an airport, as well as no prior communication as to my ticket being sold. After inquiring about my luggage, it was only after my question that she explained to me they had no track on its whereabouts. I was then forced with the task of lining up for nearly an hour to find my luggage from the lost and found, and lining up again to check my bags for my next flight. The next several hours were as one could expect. Not the ideal setting for the first day of one's holiday. The lack of adequate customer service, the lack of communication, as well as the lack of compensation is astounding in my eyes. The fact that I wasn’t made aware of this decision the airline had made for me, especially after receiving a text message previously with an update, is astounding. I cannot believe how I was treated between the two airlines on this day. Compensation in the form of two meal vouchers for a loss of a day of travel, poor service and 10 additional hours in an airport is comical. I have never voiced a formal complaint in this manner, however, given these circumstances I simply could not ignore the mistreatment. I am a frequent flyer and often travel to Europe. This is a very deterring event when considering Azores Airlines in the future. Any sort of response given the situation would be appreciated.

### "we are trapped in PDL"
Departure flight cancelled, moved back 1 day costing us additional hotel costs. And that was the nice part! On the return, flight delayed 8 hours! We take off, plane unsafe, return to Lisbon, chased down the runway by fire trucks. Sit up all night. Fly to Ponta Delgada early in the morning. No flights to Canada that day. Friday flight may or may not go on Sunday. Now there are passengers backed up as we found out Thursday was cancelled. And we are trapped in PDL. During this 3 days of hell, not only was there zero helpful communication from their staff when they did speak to us it was lies and abuse. I was shoved by one of their staff after we complained about waiting 1.5 hours to get our luggage back so we could go to the hotel. At least that was better than Friday, no hotel, no meals.

### "the worst experience ever"
Not Verified |  This airline is horrible. This was my husband and my first time to Portugal and first time flying with SATA Airlines. Not only was our flight delayed 9 hours, but when we finally got on, we took off and circled around then landed back in Lisbon. The reason for the first delay was because of technical issues. Knowing there was a problem they still put us on the plane. When we landed 15 min later back in Lisbon, there were fire trucks surrounding us. By the time we got off the plane and collected our bags, it was 12am Saturday morning. Mind you our flight was supposed to take off originally at 1:30pm Friday. Not only did they tell us we had to sleep at the airport because they could not put us in a hotel, they didn't even offer a pillow or blanket to anyone. We finally took off Saturday afternoon on a different aircraft to the Azores, after spending 31 hours at the airport. We are still fighting with them to get our money back on the flights we then had to purchase on a different airline just to get back to Lisbon. They are by far the worst experience ever. I highly recommend not flying with them at all cost.

### "friendly service"
My first experience with SATA from Ponta Delgada to Madeira was a pleasant one. Check in effective. Flight on time, friendly service, clean aircraft, good coffee. Baggage delivered quickly on the belt.

### "always some problem"
Lisbon to Ponta Delgada. I don't know where to begin. I fly Azores Airlines (SATA) quite regularly and there is always some problem with this airline. If it's not delays or aircraft breaking down, its losing your baggage or bad customer service. The food is really bad and after all the complaints, I don't understand why they have not changed it yet. Recently I flew on a leased A340 aircraft operated by a Spanish airline called Plus Ultra Airlines for SATA. The flight was from Lisbon to Ponta Delgada and then the aircraft was continuing on to Toronto. Thankfully, my final destination was Ponta Delgada, and I didn't need to continue on the what would have been a long and horrible journey to Toronto. The flight was delayed which is no surprise since I have never seen a flight of SATA depart on schedule. Whilst onboard we were given no briefing by the flight crew why the flight was delayed. We stayed at our stand for almost an hour. As a frequent flyer this aircraft was the worst aircraft I have ever been on. It was very dirty, and didn't look like it had been cleaned for a long time. Parts of the interior were very deteriorated and almost falling apart. The inflight entertainment remotes were falling out of their place exposing the wires or had parts broken off it. The tables needed force to take out and put them back in. The bathroom was very dirty. The crew were not helpful at all. We got our standard SATA meals but these ones were inedible, which consisted of stale bread and some very dried meat which many people refused to eat. The cabin crew again didn't seem to care or share very much sympathy. I would not recommend this airline to anybody.

### "all in all very pleasant"
From Horta to Corvo and then back form Flores to Horta and from Sao Jorge to Ponta Delgada. All flights on time, new aircraft, all in all very pleasant trips. Short flights without any service on board, although it would be nice to get a glass of water. Also Azores Airlines flight from Lisbon to Horta was nice, on time and with very relaxed on board atmosphere.

### "complete confusion"
Our return flight from Terceira to Boston was delayed twice spanning 8 hours stuck in the airport we were notified that the replacement aircraft would not be able to take all the passengers, therefore the flight was overbooked by 80+ passengers who were removed from the flight and offered options to fly an extra 5 hour (roundtrip) to Lisbon plus an overnight stay at a 1-star hotel, then the next day to Boston. We stood in line for over 5 hours to be rebooked with only 2 junior counter people who were inexperienced requiring them to call a supervisor by phone for codes in order to alter the passengers tickets while 2 other senior agents hide at a check-in counter, refusing to help anyone except the few who sweet-talked them into changing their flight, of which they refused to do for me. Not knowing my wife was with me they changed her tickets also, choosing, in secret whom they would help. This is no exaggeration. After the first 2 hours, only the first 2 people left the counter with altered flights (again because the agents obviously didn't know how to make the alterations). Paperwork was required for reimbursements (2-page form, 1 per passenger, 5 in my case, wife, and kids). After the first 2 hours passed we asked the counter to pass the paperwork out the the group so that we could start filling it out in line. They refused at first and after the repeated request by very agitated passengers did they start to pass out the forms as it was creating a bottleneck at the counter, but then refused to give out pens. People began buying pens at the gift shop next to the ticket counter. Again after 1 hour of refusing to give out pens (an obvious premium at SATA) they then found a box of pens to hand out (the 3rd hour in). There was no communication, no advisement. They expected stranded passengers to figure out what to do and where to go, there were 3 different lines, no guidance, SATA employees scattered from the terminal check-in area. Passengers where left to get information from each other, often conflicting. Complete confusion. There were families with children, who became desperate without access to baggage (another completely ridiculous story), many crying over the stress of the long day (7:30am check-in to 9:30 PM before everyone was served, my self last as I gave my place inline to an elderly couple who lost their place in line after they had to sit after 3 hours in line (other passengers were so desperate they refused to let them back in line where they were, that is how desperate everyone became at a certain point). Please choose another destination as the SATA staff in Terceira (and the other islands for that matter) is not capable of servicing tourist. They do not have the experience, the staff, or planes to properly handle cancelations. Their staff have a sense of entitlement and lack the sensitivity required to care and have the patience to help clients. This is not my first time on SATA and could fill pages with stories but at a point which Delta Airlines and Jet Blue are exploring direct flights, I implore them to reconsider until the Lajes Airport privatizes to a company that doesn't rely on SATA and their very, very, poor record.

### "airline gets worse every year"
Boston to Terceira. This airline gets worse every year. They essentially have the monopoly in the Azores, as far as routes and usually pricing, meaning they don't care how poorly they treat customers. I have often had them tell me there are no flights available, only to arrive at the airport to see the exact flight I wanted only half full. I have flown close to 100 times, and almost a dozen times with SATA, and I have never been asked to weigh my carry-on bags. Any other airline doesn't generally care, as long as it fits. On 12 August, we were on a flight that was less than half full, on a large A321 with plenty of overhead and cabin space. I assume because they wanted to make some extra bang for their buck, they stopped every single person at the boarding pass counter and made them weigh every carry on. If you wanted to keep it, you had to pay $100 to check it, whether it had medications or anything. The average weight of just a carry on bag alone is 9 lbs, meaning virtually no carry on will ever be light enough to be under 17 lbs. SATA has a tendency to underbook flights and delay or cancel a lot, but why they decide to gouge everyone again at the counter is beyond me. This aircraft was also utterly filthy, as when we opened our tray tables they were covered in an unknown sticky substance. I would love to tell you to never book with SATA, but sometimes you don't have a choice. If you can, do as much research as possible, as TAP, Delta, and RyanAir are starting to get flights to the islands. Maybe if they start losing enough business, they will start treating people better!

### "refusing to respond"
My sister, brother, friend, and I were scheduled to leave Boston for Terceira, Azores on January 17, 2018 with SATA flight S4232. Unfortunately the plane was cancelled. We were given no reason why, just a letter to email SATA with questions. (No phone number was provided and when we asked the employee behind the counter she repeatedly told us to email customer service. The flight was not rescheduled until January 19, 2018, two full days later. This left us holding the bag for a hotel and rental car on Faial which had been pre-paid and we missed out on. We also had taxis, food, etc. in Boston while we were waiting to find out if our flight was going to be rescheduled. (Not to mention that the Azores in January is 50-60 degrees, while Boston was around 30 degrees! We were not packed appropriately at all and had to purchase additional clothing to compensate for the differing climates.) Since that time, I have sent numerous emails and Facebook messages to SATA. Their response, after months of emails to the customer care email are two-fold. One: “The contract that is made with the Airline Company, only contemplates the passengers transportation until the final destination. The reasons for which someone travels from one point to the other are unknown to the airline company, therefore, we can neither be held responsible when a passenger fails to show at a scheduled location, nor when other contracts are made with other entities.”  Our flights were booked through a travel agent but they are all with SATA. So SATA does know we were flying on to Faial; we were on their flight. And, moreover, they re-booked us through to Faial two days after our originally scheduled departure. Two, after months of asking for reimbursement: “If you have any expenses regarding any meals you had to make during that waiting, please send them together with your bank details information (account holder, name of bank, address of bank, account number, bic/swift code, routing) for their analysis and eventual reimbursement according to SATAs regulation.” Of course I have had no acknowledgement that they even received my email, or follow-up emails. To top things off, when they did rebook us, the airplane was decrepit. The heating/cooling system didn’t work. The seats were the smallest, most uncomfortable things ever. And the flight attendants were rude. My family and I had flown SATA in the past and had no issues. However, after this total lack of, and disregard for, customer service, I will most likely be flying TAP Portugal. I understand things happen. But blatantly disregarding and abusing your customer base, ignoring emails and refusing to respond in any way, and being altogether apathetic towards your clientele is no way to operate a business. SATA needs to figure it out.

### "flight attendants nice and friendly"
Ponta Delgado to Funchal. The seating in the plane was relatively narrow. The plane made a well-maintained impression. The flight attendants spread a nice and friendly atmosphere. The drinks were adequate, but the food should be thought over. Better a few cookies than a dry roll. Overall, you can rate this flight as average.

### "Worst airline I have flown"
Ponta Delgada to Gran Canaria. Worst airline I have flown so far. Two out of two flights would be allocated a week earlier, so I arrived at noon instead of noon. Both flights were delayed. The food on board was lousy and the aircraft old. You really can not recommend this airline.

### "ashamed of this Portuguese airline"
Last month we traveled with them and it was a nightmare. First the agency (eDREAMS) that booked our flights made a "mistake" on the name of my daughter (infant). Because she has a long name, they only put down her initials for the first name. The last name and date of birth were correct. Noticing the mistake my wife contacted them and told them about the situation, and they said that we needed to contact eDREAMS to get it solved. My wife literally spent more than 5 hours between eDREAMS and SATA to get this solved. SATA insisted that there was nothing they could do, which sounded like a lie because if we decided to pay they could get it done. After many other calls, eDREAMS paid for the change (which was fine by me). On the day of the flight they printed the boarding passes and there it was my daughter's name was incomplete,  and what did they do? Fill the missing characters by hand! They made us go through all that trouble for nothing! On the flights to Portugal we had no issues, but on the way back to the US it was a very long trip. First flight from Lisbon to Ponta Delgada was fine and they served a small snack. The second flight from Ponta Delgada to Boston was late about 2hr and during the flight they announced that they wouldn't be serving food. Why? According to the "chief of cabin" they did not have enough crew and therefore everybody had to starve for 5hr 45 minutes. No compensation or warning was given to passengers about this situation so that they can find alternatives other than starving. This is unacceptable specially given that my wife is breastfeeding and I (and all other passengers) paid a ticket that included a meal. For clarity I would also like to say that the aircraft we flew in was a small A320. Just to make the point that with 3 crew members they could have served everybody with no problem. Conclusion SATA just save ~120 meals, with no care for their cutomers. I am Portuguese, and I am ashamed of this Portuguese airline. Avoid.

### "It was canceled for two days"
SATA Air Azores was the worst airline I have ever taken and I travel often. First the plane was canceled due to operational issues. It was canceled for two days. So I lost two days of my vacation and this airline would not reimburse me anything except a hotel night for those two days. I was stuck in Boston for two days. I had to rearrange my entire trip to extend the trip for the two days I lost which cost me money. The airline said they wouldn’t do anything for me. The seats are small, the food was horrible, the flight attendants were not nice, and the airplane was so hot I thought half of us were going to pass out. This airline was so bad that although I would love to come back to the islands, if I have to fly this airline I probably would not. I am not normally a negative person and I realize as a world traveler that things are different everywhere, but this airline was the worst I have flown.

### "Flight attendants were friendly"
Boston to Ponta Delgada. This airline seems to get a lot of negative reviews so I figured I'd write a review from my own experience. Check in was pleasant, boarding and departure were on time. Onboard the aircraft is older (pull down CRTs, etc), but the flight is only 4.5hrs. Full meal was served on board, food was decent. Flight attendants were friendly. Arrived less than 30 mins late. Baggage was on the carousel in PDL. For the price we paid for the flight and convenience of flying direct to Ponta Delgada from North America, would fly again.

### "an acceptable economy class"
We flew round trip from Boston to Ponta Delgada. The plane is an older aircraft, but the lights, vent, bathroom were functional. Seats were a bit cramped but workable for this duration flight. Entertainment with the center drop down TV style screens was lackluster, but it was only 4-5 hrs each way. Food was average at best, wines were good, onboard staff were friendly & courteous. We had a couple of beverage runs, if you wanted anything more the galley got it for you. It was not the nightmare flight I read about. We left about 30 min late each way, baggage was there when we landed. Overall an acceptable economy class flight.

### "no attempt to offer an explanation"
Boston to Lisbon return via Ponta Delgada. Left Boston with a delay as has been the norm for the last few years! The flight to Lisbon was uneventful of note the way SATA boards their flights: instead of calling the passengers by class, everyone camps right at the gate and so the process becomes a nightmare similar to a herd of bison on a stampede! The real fun begins on my return to Boston where I had to arrive no later than October 20th at 9 pm. I got to the airport at 10 am, for my flight scheduled to leave Lisbon at 1:05 pm, on October 20th. My bag was checked in, my boarding pass handed to me and then, I was informed that the flight was 5 hours behind without an explanation! I told the SATA representative that I was going on call at 10 pm and had to be in Boston before that! She sent me over to their sales counter where I explained the whole thing again. She was kind enough to route me to a TAP flight leaving Lisbon at 12:45 to Newark where I would then fly to Boston on JetBlue and assured me that my luggage would be taken care of. Upon my arrival in Newark, I could not find my bag so I thought they maybe I would get in when I arrived in Boston. To my dismay I got to Boston and could not find my bag anywhere! I contacted SATA, TAP, JetBlue to no avail! I got an email from TAP and JetBlue, apologizing for the incident and informing me that they would try to locate my bag. I spend most of Saturday and Sunday calling SATA in Lisbon, Ponta Delgada, and Boston being given contradictory information stating that it was not their problem because I flew TAP and JetBlue. I explained to the persons that I handed my bag to a SATA employee and had a baggage claim to prove it! That was of no use. The folks in the US basically told me to get lost because it was not their problem even though I have been flying SATA for almost 20 years! My brother in Lisbon spent hours at the airport, trying to locate the bag, since, in accordance with safety rules a bag cannot fly without the passenger so we were hoping that the bag was lying somewhere in Lost & Found in Lisbon. After several hours, he was told that they could not help him. I kept calling my agent, SATA, TAP, JetBlue without any luck. On Monday, October 23, I got a phone call from Logan Airport, Lost & Found letting me know that my nag was found on the SATA carousel and luckily, it had my contact info on the pocket so they were able to contact me so I could come and get my bag! I did go back to Logan to get it and, to my surprise, they were right: the bag flew on my original SATA flight, un-accompanied, was never opened or checked to make sure it did not pose a threat to the safety of the other passengers. Even with the baggage tag, SATA was unable or un-willing to locate and deliver the bag to me! After all, in this day and age where unfortunately so many horrible things happen all the time, I can’t fathom how a real airline can allow for such a breach of security. I called SATA again, explained the whole thing and, to my surprise, there was no attempt to offer an explanation or apology and so I decided to not only publish this review but also to open a complaint for an investigation which hopefully will prevent situations that could escalate into a tragedy.

### "service was excellent"
I was a bit worried as the reviews for this airline were not consistent. Comfortable flight. Service was excellent. Food and beverages were good. Overall pleased with this flight and services offered. Flight left on time. We would fly with this airline again.

### "I have no real complaints"
Boston to Ponta Delgada return. I've seen a lot of negative reviews about Azores Airlines/SATA. I recently completed four segments with them and found that most of the complaints were not well-founded. To preface this, the reader should remember that Azores Airlines is a budget carrier. The Azores are a small region of Portugal that has been historically underdeveloped. If you keep these concepts in mind and adjust your expectations accordingly, you can have a positive experience like the one I had. I flew two segments on one of Azores' old A310s (BOS-PDL and return). There aren't many of these around anymore, and I was interested to see how it had held up over the 25 years of service. The planes seemed to be in good condition, with a couple of cosmetic exceptions. Legroom was not great, the flights were less than 5 hours. On one, we upgraded to exit row seating (20A/B) and had unlimited leg room. It was well worth the $65 PP cost. The other two segments (PDL-BCN and return) were on newer A320s. These also had limited legroom, but were in good condition. None of the four flights that I took were delayed; all arrived on time. I checked luggage on each. It was not lost. The meals were terrible, and there was virtually no in-flight entertainment. But they got me there on time, the flight attendants were helpful, and I have no real complaints.

### "very inexperienced crew"
Flight was delayed for over one hour - no explanation or apology given until the Captain of the aircraft referred obliquely to the delayed arrival of the incoming flight - hard to believe as plane we flew-on was at the gate for at least 90 minutes before we were first called upon to board. Once called to board, we were left standing in the passenger ramp for 20 minutes - again no explanation or apology - as the limited flight crew struggled to get people onto the plane, it was like the first time any of them had managed a boarding process. Once finally onboard, we had to listen to virtually inaudible announcements on a very poor sound system - the Captain sounded almost half asleep - and then once airborne we were left without any offer of food or drink for almost 2 hours. I have no idea where the flight attendants were or what they were doing all this time but, they never appeared in the aisles. Food - luke warm and tasteless - arrived with cheap wine - they ran out of red before everyone could be served. After "dinner" we were left for almost three hours with no sight of a flight attendant offering any kind of refreshment - not even water. I wandered back behind the curtains to find the flight attendants chatting and requested water to take some medication. Movie "selection" was four movies - three of them b-rated action movies. A grand total of two TV shows available. None of the other entertainment services - map, etc. were available. The toilet on one side of the airplane ran out of water for flushing. De-planing took forever - again, managed by what appeared to be a very inexperienced crew. All in all - perhaps the worst flight experience I have had in many, many years and I fly domestically and internationally frequently.

### "staff were very friendly"
I did a trip to the Azores with my family, flying from Vienna via Lisbon to Ponta Delgada, then later from Ponta Delgada to Pico and from Horta via Lisbon to Vienna. Flights between Lisbon and the Azores LIS-PDL and HOR-LIS) as well as between Ponta Delgada and the Island of Pico were operated by SATA. All flights were on time, staff were very friendly and check-in and boarding went smoothly and on-board service was according to European standards for short and medium haul. The flight from LIS to PDL was carried out in an old A320 with worn seats and very little legroom. All other flights were just fine even in these terms.

### "worst for customer satisfaction"
I arrived at Toronto Airport 2 hours before the flight with SATA, only to find out that this flight was marked as 30 minutes delayed. I waited for almost another hour at the gate and the departure time kept on being pushed back with no announcements. Eventually, the plane started boarding and only after passing the gate as passengers were walking onto the plane, a manager was standing there and informing passengers that the flight (which was advertised and sold as a direct flight from Toronto to Lisbon) would be making a stop in Punta Delgada in the Azores. There was no explanation or apology and when I told him that this would be unacceptable he simply told me that I could get off the flight if I preferred. Extremely rude. In the end, the flight that stopped in Punta Delgada for an hour to pick up passengers there. We were told at one point by cabin crew that this was because there were passengers that were stranded there. But when I asked the passengers that got on the flight, they said that they were not stranded at all. They were getting on the flight at the right time and had bought their tickets months in advance. What became quite clear was that the airline basically decided to divert the direct flight and pass-through Punta Delgada to make use of the empty seats on the flight and fill it up, not caring at all about the inconvenience of hundreds of passengers on board. As a result, my flight arrived in Lisbon 3 hours and 15 minutes late. Not only were we not offered any sort of compensation for this, we were not even offered a simple apology. I should add that the food service was absolutely terrible and the quality of the meals served was poor. Upon researching this SATA after this experience, I see that it has been rated the worst for customer satisfaction, and I can now fully understand why. I wish I had been aware of those ratings before buying my ticket.

### "avoid this airline at all costs"
I booked and paid for 5 adult flights from Boston to Ponta Delgado, Sao Miguel in the Azores for a birthday trip destined to leave Boston Logan at Saturday 9:15pm. We were told the flight was delayed "for technical reasons" until 2am Sunday morning. After waiting 5 hours, Azores reps told us the flight was canceled; they had no more information and "to check back tomorrow". They offered a phone number to call, but the office is closed until Monday morning. At this point, the crowd became very agitated and we noticed that they had called the Boston State Police to control the crowd. Two passengers got into a fight over waiting in line. We were told that this happens on a regular basis & the State police were called out the previous Saturday. After calling around, we discovered that every hotel in Boston was booked for this Saturday night. Most people wound up sleeping on cots in the terminal. We finally found a Best Western 30 miles outside of town, arriving at 5am. The most frustrating part was that the airline representatives would not provide anyone any information at all. We returned to the airport the following afternoon and were told that we would be on the 9:30 flight, "IF... they had enough crew show up". Two other outgoing flights were delayed, another fight broke out and the State police showed up again! We finally departed at 2am on Monday morning. During our 2-day delay, we heard from several of the Boston Logan airport staff that SATA airlines does this on a routine basis. The desk agents promised I would be reimbursed for our hotel and taxi fare, but after two weeks of emailing them, I have yet to hear from them. I was recently sent an email from Sata letting me know that their company was going on strike at the end of August. I will update if they ever refund my expenses, but for now avoid this airline at all costs.

### "the oldest planes ever"
Boston to Lisbon via Ponta Delgado. Worst experience ever. Our first flight from Lisbon to Boston had a 3 hours delay and the seats are tiny. Now is the return, I'm still in the connection flight now and I have time to write this review since they take an hour delay in each step. (Get in the first airplane with delay, taxi and take off with delay, connection in the airport packed so with delay, and now that I'm in my last place, we are still waiting.) The last thing that made me smile, after leaving the airplane I took from Boston to get my connection flight, I got back into the same airplane, yes, the whole airplane did the connection. I'm not even talking about the quality of the aircraft, I think they have the oldest planes ever, Lisbon/Boston without Screens nor Sound system.

### "refused to help me"
Ponta Delgada to Lisbon. We were part of a group traveling to the Azores for a scientific conference. We received a special conference discount from Azores Airlines, but several members of our group experienced very long delays or cancellation. So did I on my flight back to Lisbon where I missed my connection to Munich. Because of the discount, Azores Airlines insisted that I have to book the two legs (Munich-Lisbon, Lisbon-Azores) separately, which I did, because they said booking it as one trip was impossible. When I missed my connection in Lisbon because of their 75 minutes late take-off, they refused to help me in any way with finding a new connection or a hotel to spend the night. The stewardess simply said that she could not help me in any way. The person at the counter was VERY unfriendly and simply kept repeating "our contract has ended". I had to book a hotel in Lisbon and find a flight to Munich the next morning, all paid by me. In stark contrast, the people of Lufthansa helped me out very efficiently and offered an inexpensive flight that got me out of my predicament. The message was clear: We do not care about our customers! I will never fly this airline again. The plane seemed a bit old and not very clean, the food was poor in quality and taste. But that was the least of my concerns.

### "worst travel experience in 25 years"
Worst travel experience in 25 years of travel. Tried to fly Boston-Ponta Delgada-Lisbon on June 25th at 10:40pm with SATA. Check-in: three hour chaos, hundreds of people lining up to the other side of the airport. No explanation as to why it was taking so long. Flight delayed: 3 hours with no explanation. We waiting at the gate until 1am, no announcements about delay or apologies. Lots of families with young kids and elderly people who didn't speak English who were at a complete loss. Flight cancelled: they cancelled the flight at 1am and sent us to the check in counter. Chaos. No representative was there from the airline, only an airport employee who didn't have any information about rebooking. They sent us home (or to hotels) to wait for more information. Flight reschedule: eventually booked on TAP airline a day later. Zero communication - no email, no text notifying us of rebooking. I only found out I was rebooked because I was trying to get on a TAP flight. Missed all my reservations in Ponta Delgada. With additional taxi fees to and from the airport I lost over $200.

### "avoid at all costs"
SATA Air Azores is a disgusting excuse for an airline. Avoid at all cost, nevermind my flight from Boston to Ponta Delgada didn't leave in time but they didn't even have the seats available I paid for. I traveled with a 5 month old and paid for a bassinet, I arrive at the counter to be told the seats where given away because the plane was changed. They had no other options but to sit without a bassinet for a 4 hour flight. They are clueless, avoid at all costs!

### "nightmare airline"
Appalling airline. Worst travel experience in over 50 years of international travel. Unfortunately, it is the only airline servicing stunning Azores. Five hour flight delay on the outbound from Boston to Ponta Delgada and two hour delay on the return. Plane sat on tarmac for an hour in Boston waiting for an open gate. Planes must be ones taken out of service by major carriers. Seats are from the 80's. No inflight entertainment, which isn't a deal breaker. Just bizarre that the seat backs have screens. One flight was chartered from a Portuguese airline, HiFly. Never a good sign. One positive was that the flight attendants were accommodating and professional. Food was atrocious. So very frustrating that the spectacularly beautiful Azores is served by this nightmare airline.

### "cheap comes out expensive"
Horrible experience for both legs of a round trip from Boston to Lisbon via Ponta Delgado with SATA Air Azores. A two hour layover became five hours, without any communication or information shared be the airline to its passengers. Warning - the cheap comes out expensive. Don't fly this airline.

### "Flew this horrendous airline"
Flew this horrendous airline Toronto to Las Palmas via Ponta Delgada. Going; flight was 7 hours delayed from YYZ which meant connecting flight to LPA was missed, since this airline only flies every 2-3 days from PDL, meant we were stuck in PDL for 2 nights, 3 days. Airline offered hotel and food and we had the chance to see this lovely city, we missed 3 days of our Gran Canaria holiday which meant hotel and transfer costs were suffered. Collecting hotel voucher in PDL was a nightmare, no help or direction. On return leg, the sole A330 went 'tech' in PDL which meant a 12 hour delay while they chartered another A330 from Hi Fly, no direction or instruction was given to over 200 passengers stranded in this tiny airport, we all had to help each other to find out how to obtain new boarding passes, re-book connecting flights etc., absolutely no agents assisting anyone, no guidance, no direction, totally mis-managed and appalling. NOTE : Azores Airlines has only one A330, if this goes tech you are stranded, Ponta Delgada is not served or connected to North America by any other carrier, connect flights via SATA to other EU destinations don't run every day.

### "it was a free for all"
We were delayed over 9 hours for our flight from Lisbon to Toronto and not once did they communicate with us as to why the flight was delayed or apologize for it. They would post a departure time and once the departure time had past, they would notify us of the following departure time. The flight time was delayed 5 times prior to us boarding. To begin with, because the flight was delayed from 15.25 to 17.00, the check in booths were moved without updating the boards. They postponed the flight from 15.25 to 19.00 to 21.00 to 21.30 to 22.30 to 23.30 and we flew at 00.00 hours. Not once did the team in the airport know why we were being delayed or how long it may last or what the next steps were. Meanwhile, they switched us to a smaller gate where there wasn't enough seating so most younger people sat on the floor. They offered us a voucher that worked in only one restaurant by the gates so there was a large lineup and shortage of food in the restaurant. They gave us new boarding passes only to tell us there was no need to line up for new boarding passes as there are no assigned seating arrangement on the flight, it was a free for all, first come first serve seating on the plane. Absolutely never flying SATA Air Azores again.

### "smooth transitions on both ends"
My wife and I flew from Toronto to Ponta Delgada on Mar 22 2017 and the flight and service provided by SATA was nothing but excellent. The flight left on time, food was great. Boarding and retrieving baggage was without a hitch, can't say enough good about this airline. We took a SATA prop plane from Ponta Delgada on March 30 to Funchal, again smooth transitions on both ends. Great experience.

### "web system could not handle request"
Toronto to Gran Canaria via Ponta Delgada. Administration and ticket sales were a huge disappointment. I wanted to fly in business class, but since we had legs of our trip with no business class availability, their web system could not handle the request. There were only 4 seats left for our international legs on the day we were ready to buy (several months in advance of the trip), so I booked through a re-seller (SATA's Toronto office hours are not great on weekends). However, I first checked via email with the Portuguese office to ensure that I would be able to upgrade after purchase. Bought the economy seats for all flights (Toronto to Ponta Delgada to Gran Canaria via Madeira return with a short stop in PD). When I attempted to upgrade our international legs (Toronto to Ponta Delgada return) I was given a price about 50% higher than the business class premium should have been. Eventually one staff member told me that the upgrade now included a fee for changes. The only remedy they offered was for me to check on flight days to see if there were any upgrades available. Of course there were not. (In fact the only response I got in Toronto was a condescending smirk.) I tried contacting customer service and appealing to the logic of other representatives with no good result. I understand penalties for changing dates or downgrading seats, but they should really rethink policies that prevent a passenger from upgrading reasonably. I am unlikely to use the airline again because of this policy. As for the flights - they were on time, or within reason with no threat of missing connections. Flight attendants were pleasant. The food and drinks were not great, but always provided. No hot drinks on short flights; complimentary wine with meals only. There is no on-board entertainment or USB plug ins. There were monitors on the Toronto to Ponta Delgada return flights, but did not work. There was a credit card slot, so perhaps you could pay for service, but I did not see anyone attempt it. Economy seats were not bad for size and comfort. Our Toronto to Ponta Delgada flights were in row 22 just in front of the washroom. This was great for the night flight but not great when passengers are awake. Lots of crying children. (I have no idea how they have the energy to cry so much and so loudly and how their parents can stand listening to it without remedy.) Washrooms were abominable and smelled strongly of urine after about 3 hours into the flight. They did replenish toilet paper and hand towels immediately when made aware of the need.

### "does not care about customer service "
&#✅ Verified Review |  My husband and I recently traveled to the Azores  and arrived home over a day later due to the flight delay of SATA Airlines. I would not recommend that anyone fly with this airline. If you travel with SATA Airlines expect very uncomfortable seats with little to no leg room, extremely limited selection of beverages, No international entertainment with limited Wifi connectability, lengthy flight delays, and No reimbursement for extra expenses caused by SATA. When my husband and I were traveling home from Ponta Delgada to Boston, the flight was delayed for 2 hours before we could even board the plane, so we arrived over 3 hours late into Boston and missed all of our connecting flights to Maryland. We both ending up missing a day of work, since we were placed on stand-by the following day and had to pay out of pocket for a hotel room in Boston that SATA Airlines refused to pay. After reading other reviews, I now see that this airline does not care about customer service and since they do not accept responsibility for their company's repeated flight delays and customer's out of pocket expenses caused by them, they will eventually go out of business or be bought out by another company. I do not recommend SATA Airlines to anyone.

### "lowers the bar one more notch"
Toronto to Lisbon via Ponta Delgada. We were flying to Lisbon with 2 carry on bags and 2 bicycles. My wife emailed ahead and confirmed bicycle tranport with weight and dimensions. She asked for price and was repeatedly referred to a website with no costs included on it. She asked again no response, just a website. Chat requests are directed to email. Long story short, the mobile version of their website differs from the dekstop version and omits critical information. I got dinged with significant oversize fees for bikes that i had previously provided info on and asked for cost. A link with the info or a heads up that i was looking at an extra $600 would have been helpful. Do not expect [email protected] to fill in the gaps or do anything beyond the minimum - actually dont even expect "the minimum". Do not expect check in staff to do anything but plead "no authority". If flying out of North America on an evening flight do not expect anyone to be available that has "authority". In fact do not expect to ever speak or IM with anyone. IMs result in being directed to email. No in flight entertainment. Meals and seats were fine. No complaints there. In a hated industry, with ever dissatisfied customers, SATA successfully lowers the bar one more notch.

### "undue stress and frustration"
❎ Unverified |  We travelled on Flight S4301 from Lisbon to Toronto on Feb 10th. Firstly, the entertainment system did not work on our flight to Lisbon on Jan 7th and still was not working on Feb 10th flight. Most importantly: We never check baggage when flying: however SAT Azores limits cabin baggage to 8 kg so we reluctantly checked two small bags weighing approx 10 kg each. Arriving in Toronto the whole flight's luggage did not arrive on carousel 9 for 1.5 hrs. Other flights landed after us and had baggage on carousels before they got thru customs e.g. Georgetown/Port of Spain, Miami and Reykjavik. 1.5 hrs to get luggage is totally unacceptable - no one can leave for a connecting flight without taking luggage thru customs. This caused undue stress and frustration for the whole flight.

### "fly again if the cheapest option"
I have mixed reviews. The check in process in Boston was extremely smooth and my flight was right on time. My first leg from Boston to Ponta Delgada was on an old plane with very small seats and tiny overhead bins. I have never been on a plane with smaller seats. I am 5ft 2in and when the tray for the meal came down I couldn't move my legs one bit. We landed in the Azores on time and instead of going through the transit line like the people going to Lisbon, the connecting flight to Porto had to go through immigration and customs (even though I had a boarding pass for my next flight and the flight was made all on one booking), out to the check in area and back through security, only to walk directly back past the transit door on the way to my gate. My next flight to Porto was delayed two hours because the plane was late coming in from Toronto, but delays are expected so that didn't really bother me. My plane going to Porto was a newer plane with large, leather seats and lots of space in the overhead bins. If only that was my plane from Boston I might have gotten some sleep. The flight was smooth and the flight attendants on both flights were nice and helpful. The food was fine, nothing special but not bad. Overall, it wasn't the worst travel experience but not the best. I would fly them again if it was the cheapest option by a significant amount but would probably pay a little extra for a nicer airline.

### "food is a complete disaster"
Lisbon to Toronto via Ponta Delgada. There is absolutely no explanation for why people fly with SATA Azores Airlines, there is no entertainment on board, not even the old ones - they have the screens in every chair, however there is no actual program running on them. The food is a complete disaster, sandwiches are freezing cold! I have made a stopover in Ponta Delgada on my way to Toronto, where people is obliged to stay in two rooms where there is only one place that sells food or water while they wait for their flight. If you ask to go to the rest of the airport, that is just around the glass wall, where the restaurants and space that can actually support 600 persons stoped on these 2 rooms, no one will let you! There is no seats available half the people they obligate to stay in this rooms.

### "worst airline I have ever flown"
Boston to Sao Miquel, Azores. Worst airline I have ever flown. Our flight was delayed from 10:15 pm on Oct. 11, 2016, until 9 am on October 12, 2016; and we did not leave until 11 am on the 12th. Therefore, we lost an entire day in the Azores. After all the delays, one would expect the airline staff to be especially friendly and attentive. Worst crew I have ever come across, and I travel on airlines frequently. Not a smile. After having no service for food or drinks for two hours after take off, I asked for water and was told to go to the back of the plane to get it. The flight attendants, except for one, were actually nasty. Only one had big smiles and was very helpful.

### "ruined a great vacation"
Ponta Delgada to Boston with SATA. Flight was delayed 4 or 5 times throughout the day. 8-9 hours later it was cancelled for "technical" reasons. They couldn't figure out all day that this one and only plane could not be fixed. Now we are waiting in line for over an hour while 2, yes only 2 people help an entire plane with hotel vouchers. Ruined a great vacation. I will never come back here again until real airlines start flying here. SATA has not figured it out how to take care of its customers. They don't even have a second plane to assist. One guy has been here since Sunday trying to fly to Boston. It's now late Tuesday. Are you kidding me?

### "service was substandard"
Porto to Ponta Delgado. Well, bellow average service from a below average company. Long boarding times for such a small flight. Overhead bins were stuffed because the company couldn't be bothered with asking the passengers to let their extra items go to the cargo bay, and didn't care with checking baggage sizes and number of bags per costumer which lead to a lot of passenger not having space to stow their belongings while other carried much more than they paid for. This lead to delays on the departure and lots of confusion and upset passengers. They seemed a bit amature and not profissional ground and cabin crew. At least one of the stewardesses tried to find me space for my, bag. She was in fact one of the nicest I have ever had on this company. Food was plain, boring and uninspiring, consisting in a boring (and rather small) sandwich with not so fresh ingredients (seriously, the lettuce was so dark it looked like it was out of date), a drink, a coffee and some sort of assorted cookies, all terrible and dry. Inflight entertainment was non existent and they only screened a movie about the Azores, in screens to small that no one could actually read the subtitles and with no chance to hear the sound. No wifi options were provided and the stewardess forced me to turn off my phone, even though it was in flight mode, way before the landing, other companies don´t do that. For a 130€ price for a 2h flight, service was substandard and it was very overpriced.

### "the worst plane I've ever flown"
Boston to Ponta Delgada. While the staff and crew were very friendly, and attempting to be accomodating, this is the worst plane I believe I've ever flown in. After a four hour departure delay, which I was told by several of the airport vendors 'was quite usual,' we finally left Boston and headed toward Sao Miguel/Ponta Delgada. The plane was very stuffy snd warm, there were no air vents overhead. What? I've never seen a plane without overhead ventilation controls, typically next to the overhead lighting and flight attendant call buttons! Even after asking flight attendants for assistance, the flight was very warm and uncomfortable. No in-flight entertainment whatsoever. Screens were in place on the back of each seat, but they were not powered on, and there was no cabin movie. The seats were tiny, and very uncomfortable. And the very bright, cabin lights were left on during the entire flight (2am -7am) rather than dimming them for sleep. So, a major delay in departure, bright lights throughout a night flight, no AC or even circulating air, tiny seats with no legroom, no in-flight entertainment. They get kudos for getting us here safely, but if there were another alternative, I would never fly this airline again.

### "an inept airline"
Do not fly SATA unless you love airports. We have been to Sao Miguel five times and experienced delays on three flights. Delays of 7 hours and 2 hours previously and we are now in the middle of what will be a 27 hour delay. They want us to fly Lisbon to Manchester via Amsterdam despite the fact that we will miss a connection again if there is a delay of 45 minutes. An inept airline.

### "confusing communication"
Ponte Delgada to Boston with SATA Air Azores. Only a fool would fly on this inept airline. The disorganization and the confusing communication are just part of this chaos. I had injured my leg while on vacation and had to use wheelchair assist. Imagine my shock and dismay to learn that they board wheelchairs after the rest of the passengers are already seated. When I requested a seat that had some room to accomdate my braced and bandaged knee, they lied and said I had a wheelchair seat. It was row 18 in the back of the plane and a standard seat. I couldn't even get in the bathroom.

### "inflight service warm and happy"
London Gatwick to Ponta Delgada. After reading negative reviews I was petrified about our first flying family holiday with our 4 and 9 year old. Spending a week on Sao Miguel and a week on Faial. 4 flights, right down to inter island 36 seater prop job. Best flights we've had, smooth, inflight service was always warm and happy, few delays but they always made it to destination on or before time. Family and kids first policy I thought was really helpful. Could not recommend SATA enough. Clean planes, blue leather seats across all fleet.

### "inconsistent service with this airline"
I made a round trip with SATA Air Azores from Lisbon to Ponta Delgada. The Blue lounge in Lisbon is nothing to write home about. First of all its located on the other side of the airport from where the SATA flights depart. Second the lounge was dirty. Not a good first impression when you fly business class. The flight to Ponta Delgada continues onward to Boston and boarding was quite chaotic. Boarding was announced and we had to make 2 queues which everybody did. There is no priority boarding with this airline. After the announcement nothing happened for 30 minutes and all out of sudden the announcement was made that passengers for Ponta Delgada should be standing in the right row and passengers for Boston should be standing in the left row so everybody had to switch positions again. After scanning the boarding passes it was down on the stairs were everybody had to wait for another 20 minutes before the busses arrived. After the ride to the remote stand we had to wait again for 15 minutes on the bus because the aircraft was not ready yet. During boarding there was no welcome from the crew. It seems they were too busy chit chatting with each other. The flight departed an hour late from scheduled departure time. The aircraft was clean but looked a bit outdated from the inside, strange since this aircraft is very new to their fleet. Food was very good. However the entertainment system is not working. After lunch I wanted to relax a little and decided to recline my seat (2K) which did not work. After notifying the crew that my seat was broken I was told: "It's just a short flight! and that was it. Not a great attitude towards a business class passenger. On the way back to Lisbon it was a better experience. The lounge at Ponta Delgada airport is small but it's just a tiny airport so no problem. There were some fresh fruits, cookies, crackers, nuts and sufficient drinks in the lounge. The flight to Lisbon on the A320 departed on time this time. A friendly welcome from the crew and I settled into my seat. No real business class seats on the A320 but a standard economy seat with the middle seat blocked. Service on this flight was good. The crew was interested if I liked my stay on the Azores. Food on this flight was not so great. We got a very dry samosa with some vegetables and potatoes which were cold and very salty. The flight did arrive on time in Lisbon and after a bus ride from the remote stand (again) I arrived at the terminal building for my next flight to Amsterdam. To sum it up: On my outbound flight to the Azores the food was good but the crew was rude and the lounge was a mess. On the inbound flight the lounge and the crew was great but the food was not.

### "lost its way in customer service"
Horta to London Heathrow via Lisbon. A lack of customer care and support left us frustrated at Lisbon. Technical issues with the Horta to Lisbon flight meant that we were just in time to board our scheduled connection to London. Our luggage was not - it hadn't been deplaned from the Horta flight. We were given two choices - board the connection now and the luggage might follow today - or tomorrow and it was our responsibility to collect from London Heathrow. Or wait for the next flight three hours later. No choice then as no one wants to be separated from their luggage at Heathrow. I accept that flights can be delayed but the complete lack of ground support from SATA for travelers with connecting flights (even under code share) is unforgiveable. From other reviews it looks like a nice little airline has lost its way in customer service and support. Oh and don't get me started on the in-flight catering - possibly the driest sandwiches in recorded history.

### "don't want to fly again this airline"
I took 5 times a SATA flight within my 3 weeks holidays. They all were delayed. The last one, from Ponta Delgada to Lisbon was 1 hour delayed, so that I couldn't get my connectin flight back to Toulouse at 3:00 p.m. and had to take a flight (TAP) at 9:10 pm; which has been 1 hour delayed too. So that I arrived around 1:00 a.m. instead of 5:45 pm, and no other means to go further to my home city 60 km away. Thanks to SATA, I arrived in Toulouse with 7 hours delay. SATA gave me just a 10€ voucher for a dinner at Lisbon airport, not even for a drink. The food onboard was quite uneatable. The ground staff was apparently not involved in what would happen to me after this delay, it seemed it was not their problem. I deeply regret SATA being the only way to get to Azores, and I think I will not go back there just because I don't want to fly ever again with this airline. My complain to customer's service has not got any answer so far.

### "very disappointed with the service"
Toronto to Funchal via Ponta Delgada. This is not the first time we fly SATA Air Azores, I'm very disappointed with the service and planes we have available to the Acores! Very stuffy (no air) no movies! Actually we were giving the earphone (but never saw a movie) it's a long flight so entertainment is a plus! Why do we (flying from Canada) have to fly in old aircrafts when Boston have the new ones? If there was other planes to the Acores we would never fly SATA Air Azores! My whole family travel to the Acores every year!

### "never seen such a disorganized airline"
Boston to Ponta Delgada with SATA Air Azores. I was very disappointed with this airline, the seats were extremely small, and I am only 5'4", so I can imagine how bad it was for taller people. The flight to Ponta Delgada is an overnight flight, but the lights kept coming on and off the whole flight. They served a meal a few hours into the flight, but it smelt so bad (and I was woken up from sleeping) that I didn't try any. The food on the way back to Boston was edible, though. We left Boston almost 45 minutes late as well. We also flew from Ponta Delgada to Santa Maria for a few days, and that 15 minute flight each way was on time and fine. When we left Ponta Delgada to return to Boston, the flight was an hour late leaving, making me miss my flight back home to Phoenix. They spent the time busing us all from the gate to the plane, even though they made us walk the distance when we first arrived, and that process was slow and unorganized. I have never seen such a disorganized airline, even in Boston, they don't have lanes to line up in, so everyone crowds the doorway, making it impossible for the people who are supposed to be boarding to board. This happened on all flights, very disorganized and no semblance of order for the passengers. The video and entertainment systems did not work on any of the flights, either. I really hope to return to the Azores Islands, as they were beautiful, but I really hope there are better (and more) choices for flights the next time I go.

### "no free booze, no TV"
Boston to Ponta Delgada with SATA. Just like every other airline tryingg to scrape every last dollar out at any cost. Lights stayed on on the overnight flight, no free booze, no TV, terrible food, very small seats/leg room, flight departure changed times +/- 2 hours several times without notice due to poor logistical planning on their part.

### "crew were very attentive"
I recently flew SATA Air Azores from Lisbon to Boston, with a stop in Ponta Delgada, and they surpassed my expectations. They served lunch on the first sector, even though it was a relatively short flight. On the second sector, they served a full dinner and the food was surprisingly very good. The selection of wines was also great. The crew were very attentive and worked hard throughout the flight. They tried their best to make the passengers happy and I would fly this airline again. The A330 we flew on looked brand new.

### "bring some entertainment"
I flew with SATA Air Azores in December 2015 from Toronto to Lisbon. The aircraft interior was a bit old. They had those small TV screens overhead playing VHS tapes. I found it quite amusing. They didn't play any movies on it, instead they had little ads and commercials and destination guides. I couldn't sleep that well as the crew kept coming down the aisles and switching the lights on, despite it being an overnight flight (was only 5 hours long though). The staff were nice, although it wouldn't hurt them to smile a bit more. The food was ok. I had brought my ipad to watch movies on, you might want to do this to pass the time. The main thing is that it was a safe flight. Overall, I would fly them again as the cheap price gets my nod. I would just make sure to bring some entertainment along.

### "will definitely fly them again"
We had no problems with SATA during this trip. We were a bit scared based on other reviews, but the trip was very smooth. In fact, after flying other American based airlines, it may seem a bit luxurious. They offer you drinks and a full meal. The meal was nothing special, but it was a nice gesture to get you through the flight. I did think it was weird that they served dinner at 11:30 pm on an overnight flight. It would have made more sense to serve a breakfast, since the flight landed at 7 am. The chairs on the side of the airplane reclined a lot, which was my biggest complaint. This led to a really rude couple in front of us taking full advantage of it. With the seat fully reclined, we did feel pretty cramped. But, overall we will definitely fly them again.

### SATA Air Azores customer review
Seats very small, absolutely no leg room. Waited in PDL for 30 mins on board with no A/C. Landed in Boston but had to wait more than an hour for a gate, again with no A/C. I'm dripping as I write this. Find another airline if you can.

### SATA Air Azores customer review
My flight was delayed 2 hours, made me miss my connecting flight. Food was good, old plane. My parents are/were leaving today, their flight was to leave at 3, but was delayed until 5 then again at 8, 11 and 1am, finally they were given notice to come back again tomorrow at 3, then it was changed to 5.

### SATA Air Azores customer review
After reading reviews about SATA airline, I purchased trip insurance. I am happy to report that everything went smoothly. The flight left Boston about 45 min late but landed in Ponta Delgada on time. While we waited we were kept informed. I ordered a vegetarian meal which came out first and was quite tasty. Crew was polite. For all the negative reviews I read I felt the need to post about the positive experience we had with SATA.

### SATA Air Azores customer review
SATA Airlines has the worst service I’ve ever experienced. The company has a complete disregard for customers, planes are old, and considerable delays are the norm. On Tuesday, June 16, 2015, we had a flight from PDL to Boston scheduled for 3pm. An email was sent to us at 4:30pm that day - 90 minutes after the original departure time - informing us of a substantial delay. Instead of leaving PDL at 8:15pm, as stated in the timely message, we ended up staying in the airport until 11pm - 8 hours after the original departure time. This forced us to stay an extra night in Boston and lose our connecting flight to NYC. We got to our hotel in Boston with a crying 5-month old baby at 2:30am on June 17th. In the airport, and on the plane, there was no attempt to apologize for the inconvenience or accommodate any of our needs. SATA’s customer service is so appalling it’s almost laughable. You should avoid flying with this airline at all costs.

### SATA Air Azores customer review
We flew Amsterdam - Ponta Delgada and back. Both flights had no delays, friendly crew, nice food and drinks and good leather seats. What a relief, compared to those low budget Transavia horrors without food or leg space at all.

### SATA Air Azores customer review
We experienced changes in the flight schedules on all three inter-island flights all were announced by SATA several days before the flight so it had nothing to do with bad weather. The flight from Ponta Delgada to Horta would leave at 15.45 in stead of 08.30. The flight from Horta to Terceira would leave at 17.05 instead of 13.25. The flight from Terceira to Ponta Delgada would leave at 13.20 in stead of 14.30. Apart from that the flight from Lissabon to Ponta Delgada was cancelled due to bad weather (so they said). This was handled in a chaotic way. Staff had apparently no idea what to do. After some three hours passengers were told to go to busses that would bring them to a hotel. Unfortunately the bus driver did not receive clear instructions so he dropped us in the wrong hotel. The flight on the next day had a delay of more than 2.5hours for which SATA gave no compensation vouchers.

### SATA Air Azores customer review
I've flown on SATA Air Acores round-trip to Terceira Ponta Delgado and Lisbon at least 10 times. Service has always been excellent with flight attendants and pilots who spoke Portuguese andEnglish fluently. They make you feel welcome and do everything they can to make your flight comfortable and enjoyable. All of the flights have been on-time or at the latest within 15 minutes of scheduled departure/arrival time. The only complaint that I have is that the ticket prices have sky-rocketed! If I were wealthy I wouldn't have any complaints at all about SATA!

### SATA Air Azores customer review
I used Sata's service from Toronto to Lisbon with a stopover in Ponta Delgada.. After reading the reviews I was a little apprehensive about having a decent flight experience and I must say SATA doesn't offer a bad experience. There was a bit of a delay out of Toronto but once in the Air the service was good. Inflight meals in economy were as good if not better than even some International flag carriers. There was no in seat entertainment option but the aircraft is an older 310 so to be expected and since it was a red eye flight most people slept after the meal anyway.. FA's were friendly and professional. I would fly SATA again for sure especially when they offer attractive fares.

### SATA Air Azores customer review
Flew Toronto - Lisbon return Feb 2015. Flights were on time. Cabin crew courteous. A310 aircraft is old but kept cabin kept in a clean condition. Seats were hard and could not get comfortable. Restricted to one choice at meal time. On the way out to Lisbon meat was provided and return only chicken. Wine served with the meal was low quality. Very acidic. One passenger complained and the attendant returned with a bottle from business class. Maybe they should serve the same wine to all passengers. Arrange with the airline in advance if you have diet issues. Entertainment was basic. A few screens centre overhead aisle. No duty free. After the meal if a drink was required self service at the back galley.

### SATA Air Azores customer review
Jan 17th to Jan 28th 2015. Flight S4321 from Toronto to Lisbon to Ponta Delgada to Toronto. My 4th time flying with Sata and this time was even more pleasant than previous. I have experimented some delays with them but then what airline hasn't! I find the stewards excellent and accommodating to their passengers. They feed you like there's no tomorrow!

### SATA Air Azores customer review
Our flight from Ponta Delgada to Boston on October 7th was 5.5 hours late after being told it would be 3 hours late. No information other than that was given. No one appeared at the check-in desk until right before departure time. There was no order in boarding. There was no message from the captain at take off (or at any other time during the flight) apologizing for the delay. The crew was surly and rude. The plane was old the movie "wobbled" at times and the headphones did not work. This airline is not doing the Azores tourism business any good. People will not travel to the Azores if they have to put up with this unprofessional behavior. As the flight was so late everyone on it missed their connections. Great work SATA!

### SATA Air Azores customer review
My husband and I recently traveled to Portugal (Azores and Lisbon) on SATA airlines. I had read reviews prior to traveling and was a little concerned. They weren't good. But we had the opposite experience. Each flight we took with SATA was just wonderful. Found the check in process easy the planes fine and the staff both on the ground and in the air could not have been any nicer. I will definitely recommend SATA and will use them again.

### SATA Air Azores customer review
Flew from Boston to Lisbon and back on SATA. Flight going over was an hour late but coming back we left right on time and even got into Boston early. Overall was not a bad experience. Food was pretty good and service was excellent. Free blankets pillows and wine on board which is not true for other airlines. Maybe we were just lucky but I was pleasantly surprised after reading all the negative comments here. Only negatives were that the cabin was very cold coming back but to me that's better than too hot. Also going up and down the stairs with luggage is tough for some people.

### SATA Air Azores customer review
Perhaps we lucked out? We were a little hesitant to fly SATA originally after reading all the reviews but our flight from Toronto to Ponta Delgada was one of the best flying experiences we've had a long time. It was a red eye flight leaving Toronto at 9.55pm in the evening. I must admit at first we were a little worried when we were still waiting at the gates at 9.30pm with no sign of any ground crew. However no less than 5 minutes later the ground staff showed up and began boarding passengers very quickly and efficiently. By around 10pm we were all boarded and the flight left the gate. It was actually pretty amazing they managed to board everyone in 15 minutes and still left on-time unlike many of our Air Canada experiences. The flight arrived to Ponta Delgada as scheduled and during the flight we had two drink services a meal a snack and hot towel service. The flight is less than 6 hours so they actually packed in a lot of value for the duration of the flight (and especially considering how little of anything airlines offer these days). Sure they didn't have an in-seat movie selection but it was a red eye flight so we slept for the most part. The flight attendants were well-groomed and very professional. They were bilingual and were very friendly. We were very happy with our experience and would definitely fly SATA again.

### SATA Air Azores customer review
August 8 flight from BOS to LIS. Flight left BOS 90 minutes late and no updates were provided while waiting. We fly business class on SATA however Business class service has go down in quality. In flight meals not as good as they were years ago. Fight was okay however planes could use some updating. LIS to BOS flight was fine less than a half-hour delay. Overall okay.

### SATA Air Azores customer review
I flew Gatwick - Ponta Delgada in June 2014. There was a delay in departing but nothing excessive. However the in-flight service was poor painfully slow in fact and to add to this irritation the fact that the food was disgusting. My payment was accepted for an alcoholic drink however no change given. It is their policy to reimburse passengers after they have finished the final clear up but unfortunately we were not told this and I had the embarrassment of having to request my change from E10 as I eventually concluded it must have been an oversight. Rather expensive flights especially internally. However there is no option as I understand that they have an agreed fare tariff with TAP! It seems that pets are not allowed to travel from the UK. Upon enquiry I was told that this was UK Government legislation. Having contacted DEFRA regarding this they claim it is down to the airline. Tried customer service for assistance but no response. However they have been helpful on other occasions.

### SATA Air Azores customer review
On a recent flight to Terceira from Logan plane 4 hours late for departure. No explanation was ever given for delay warm soda and bags of chips were provided at the last minute for the weary hungry passengers. On return trip from Terceira I requested a window seat but was disappointed to find that I was given a center seat instead. Cabin was extremely warm seats were crowded overhead air vents were not working earplug jacks were non- functional. Flight attendants were grumpy. Upon touchdown at Logan everyone erupted into an applause must have been because they actually arrived on time for a change. Why is this the only airline allowed into the Azores? They need competition to bring down the prices and improve the service.

### SATA Air Azores customer review
Recently returned from a one week vacation to Terceira Azores. Plane was supposed to depart out of Logan at 10.15pm as soon as I entered the airport I was greeted by a delay until 1.15am did not take off until 2am. No reason was ever given for the 4 hour delay (weather was perfect) however upon talking to other passengers I found out it was due to mechanical difficulties of the scheduled plane and a substitute plane had to be sent out. Adding insult to injury no attempt to give us food vouchers was made. The last hour before departure the SATA staff dragged out a few cases of warm soda bags of chips and cookies. On the return flight to Logan (#4231) I had requested a window seat instead what I got was a center seat. The overhead air vents were broken and the cabin temperature was very warm. I alerted the flight attendants twice about these conditions and their response was that we cannot repair the vents now as the plane was in flight. A movie was provided so I decided to plug in my earphones and check it out; the jack connection was flimsy and kept falling out all I would get is intermittent static. Both the outside and interior of this plane looked very used and in need of maintenance. To their credit we did arrive on time.

### SATA Air Azores customer review
Flew Oakland-Terceira on Aug 5 2014 flight 236. Well aware of the cramped space in economy class I paid over 2K for an executive seat extra leg room and supposed extra comfort on an 11 hour flight. Instead this is what a two thousand dollar "Executive Class”service you get from Oakland to Terceira: 1) The flight had a departure of Aug 4th but it was delayed 27 hours one vacation day lost! 2) My executive seat was not functioning! From Oakland to Toronto (approx. 5.5 hours) I was unable to recline my seat! 3) In Toronto they made minimal effort to repair the seat but to no avail. I did discover how to manually make my seat recline however the foot rest never fully opened up. 4) The meal from Oakland to Toronto was substandard at best however it was much better than the cold sandwich served us from Toronto to Terceira (approx. 5.5 hour flight). 5) In“Executive”we are supposed to have “ priority” luggage which supposedly means our luggage is to be unloaded first -…mine was unloaded 1.5 hours after landing. I was the last person to leave baggage claim in Terceira! Despite SATA touting preferred service for their SATA Plus customers those flying out of Oakland have very little preferred service! If this is the best SATA can do in their Executive class they have no right to charge 3x more for these seats! For the same money I could’have bought 3 seats in economy class had the same service and the same comfort as what I got in Executive.” The only positive aspect to my flight over was that I arrived safely.

### SATA Air Azores customer review
S4222 7/5-7/6 and S4201 7/16. Beware when flying low budget airlines overseas. On the plus side SATA did safely deliver us relatively on time to our destinations both flights. The vintage circa 1983 Airbus 310 added some adventure. Unfortunately it also added a lot of discomfort. The plane was extremely cramped and hot with bad seats no inflight entertainment systems and perhaps the worst food in an industry known for bad food. What was most impressive was the absolute disdain by which SATA staff treated the passengers. I'm pretty convinced they learned to be this way through training as there's no way so many staff in two separate cities and on one of the two flights could all be this way. The bathroom lacked toilet paper drink carts brimming with trash and for at least two hours on the Lisbon-Boston flight the attendants were nowhere to be seen. I loved Portugal but next time will stick to TAP to get there!

### SATA Air Azores customer review
Easily the worst airline I've ever flown. Outgoing flight from Boston was cancelled (which seems to be a recurring theme with SATA) so we lost a whole day of vacation. The plane was very old and so cramped that my knees were touching the seat in front of me - and then that person reclined his seat so that it was about a foot from my face. This might be fine for a 2 hour flight but a flight that is almost 5 hours? It's inhuman. The food was some kind of boiled slop with mystery seafood at the bottom. I've never been picky about airline food but this was disgusting. Most people just ate the roll and left the rest. Lack of personal space made it almost impossible to actually eat. Coming back the plane was delayed an hour it sounded as though all the SATA planes were delayed as well. People at the next gate started clapping in unison to get the staff to let them board the plane. Clearly SATA's fleet of planes is old and broken down and this causes frequent delays. This is no way to run a business.

### SATA Air Azores customer review
19 Feb PDL-TER. 19 Feb TER-PIX. 24 Feb PIX-PDL. Very quick response after contact via email. Very friendly and quick responses during the complete procedure. At the airport counters and check-ins we met friendly SATA employees as well. There is only one negative thing to talk about: The food. If I was responsible for the food on the planes - I would change the caterer immediately.

### SATA Air Azores customer review
Booked a TAP flight from Lisbon to Terceira that turned out to be code shared and operated by SATA. This is an underestimated airline and I was pleasantly surprised by the comfort of the seating as well as the quality of the service. I will book SATA on my next trip to the Azores.

Flew SATA from Boston to Lisbon and then back via the Azores. All flights were on time. Food was very good. Business class is an excellent deal - just a few hundred dollars for a bigger seat w/ foot rest departure lounge nice meal early boarding all the extra touches. Inflight staff were great - on the ground staff very helpful. A great trip.

We flew from Boston to Ponta Delgada in August round-trip. The service was excellent they served hot meals and just before landing the flight attendant passed out warm towelettes.

### SATA Air Azores customer review
Toronto to Sao Miguel Aug 28 and return Sept 18. New alliance with West Jet helps immensely with baggage handling from Edmonton. Service by ground and in-flight staff is excellent and fully bilingual. Pleasant hard working and highly professional. Meal okay but beverage service with wines and coffee is excellent. Seats are short for a tall person and seats are closer together compared to West Jet. Cabins clean and no apparent repairs needed. Older cabin features. For the money paid for the round trip flight this was a great value.

### SATA Air Azores customer review
Amsterdam to Sao Miguel flight S4 551 May 6. Second from Sao Miguel to Amsterdam on May 13 flight number S4 550. Flew with SATA twice first time we had a delay of 22 hours and the second time we had a delay of almost 4 hours. Never again. The planes are pretty rickety.

### SATA Air Azores customer review
Toronto-Lisbon on 6/21. Lisbon-Ponta Delgada on 6/30. Ponta Delgada - Toronto on 7/2. All of the above flights departed timely. The crew were very friendly pleasant and accommodating. In-flight service was excellent including meals and beverage selections. SATA's widebody aircraft are A310's that are a little older and show some signs of age (though I'm sure they are maintained well) but overall seats were comfortable and the aircraft cabin was clean. The in-flight entertainment systems were a little intermittent however with a couple of screens (and several earphone jacks) not functioning properly. Luckily my longest flight with them was only 6 hours in length. I would recommend passengers bring their own books magazines earphones and a smartphone or similar device for entertainment. Overall I believe SATA provided very good service and good value - better than some 4-star airlines I have flown with.

Flew to Sao Miguel from Toronto return on A310. All flights left on time. Flight crew kept passengers informed about progress including southerly route change due to Hurricane Irene. Cabin crew members were friendly helpful and bilingual. Meal and snack on both flights were above average. Beverages included juices coffee tea and good Portuguese wine. On return trip Audio for the movie (pull down screens) did not work for many seats around our section. Stopped in at SATA office in Ponta Delgada to work out a better seat selection. They were helpful and courteous. Service overall has improved over the last couple of years disappointed with technical problems onboard but the staff and service were good.

Flew Boston to Santa Maria via Ponta Delgada. Check-in in Boston was extremely slow and as a result after TSA searched my bag there was no time to put it on my plane. Received my bag in Santa Maria 2 days after my arrival. It was impossible to find out if my bag was still in Boston or went to Lisbon. The plane was noisy and was packed with passengers. Seat width/pitch is oriented toward an average Portuguese person so for somebody above 6 feet and/or wide build seats are extremely cramped. Staff was friendly and the food was above average. Entertainment system is dated. Overall the price is pretty high for what you get. But there are no other flights direct to Azores from the US East coast.

London Gatwick-Ponta Delgada Sao Miguel Azores. The outward flight departed on time Airbus A320 aircraft looked in an excellent condition very clean and looked brand new. Flying time 3hrs 40 mins very smooth flight with no turbulence. The crew were very friendly and helpful. A passenger was unwell during the flight and the stewardess was very caring bringing extra drinks cold towels and checked how she was feeling every so often. The flight was approximately three quarters full. The small complimentary baguette tasted nicer than it looked and there was a chocolate bar with tea and coffee. In addition to this there was two rounds of soft drinks water apple juice orange juice etc all complimentary. Alcoholic drinks were available for a charge. The outbound flight was direct but the return flight was via Manchester. The flight left on time just after 1pm and we arrived in Manchester 10 mins early. Flight was very smooth with the same complimentary drinks and sandwiches as the outbound flight. Cabin crew were friendly and very professional. When we landed in Manchester Airport there was some confusion. We knew before hand that we had to disembark the aircraft at Manchester. Some of the passengers were unaware of this and the crew only mentioned that the Gatwick passengers had to disembark when we landed. When the cabin doors opened all of the passengers for Manchester and Gatwick stood up and the crew announced that the Gatwick passengers should sit down to let the Manchester passengers disembark first. If the crew told us this before hand it would have made life much easier. The Gatwick passengers eventually disembarked (with lots of moans and groans) and the passengers were given an in transit boarding card. Gatwick passengers had to take all of their hand luggage to the security check point have the bags scanned and then board the same plane back to Gatwick. The whole process was ridiculous but apparently this is due to UK immigration not SATAs fault. We departed Manchester on the same aircraft 1hr later for the 35 mins flight to Gatwick. We arrived in Gatwick over 20 mins early. Overall very impressed with SATA. Modern aircraft excellent timekeeping with a friendly and professional crew. I will definitely fly with them again.

Boston-PTA Delgada-Boston. Boarding process quite good. Flights left on time. Very attentive cabin crews. Food decent. All in all flights very good. My only complaint is with the US reservation office. Chaotic at best. They do not communicate very well. Don't bother emailing you get no response.

I had a flight from Toronto to Porto with a stop at Ponta Delegana. The flight was scheduled to leave at 10pm. Before leaving the house I decided to go online and check the departure times to make sure it wasn't delayed. It was delayed 2 hours - after I had got ready to leave again checked online again and it was delayed to 2pm the following day. This enraged me as I was paying for my rented car as I was still in Toronto. The following day it was delayed again to 3. I called Sata and it turns out that they divided the Ponta Delegana flight with the Porto flight. This meant that I would be going on a Lisbon airport the day after at 6am. It's not the first time of Sata doing this either.

### SATA Air Azores customer review
Toronto to Porto then Lisbon to Ponta Delgada and Ponta Delgada to Toronto. All three flights left and arrived within a few minutes of scheduled times and flight crews were very courteous. Meals as good as any other airlines and wine was probably better. The aircraft were clean and appeared to be well maintained. They had movies during the flight but the plane had the old style drop down TVs. The only real complaint was the flight from Lisbon to Ponta Delgada was originally scheduled for 1250 but was changed to 1630 without anyone notifying us - even though we had provided both cell phone numbers and email. As a result we had to sit around the Lisbon airport for an extra three hours. The seats are also very close together and don't provide a lot of legroom for a long flight. Otherwise everything else was great and we are planning to travel with SATA again.

### SATA Air Azores customer review
Toronto to Ponta Delgada and back and flight was exceptional. Service on board was good staff polite. Economy food was okay but I bring my own food anyway. The interior seemed a bit dated legroom was good and there were tv's with movies.

### SATA Air Azores customer review
Manchester to Ponta Delgado on San Miguel in the Azores. Got no food or drink for about 3 hours (around 22.00). Had to get off in Gatwick for 1.5 hours while the plane was being cleaned and food put on. Baggage lost for 3 days for self and friend. Trying to get compensation. They won't accept receipts unless the item is named. Now I have to search for the Iban code and BIC/Swift code before we can receive anything. Another member of our crew lost his baggage the next day and 30 other bags had been lost at the same time!

### SATA Air Azores customer review
Manchester-Ponta Delgada return avoiding dust situation fortunately. Preferable in-flight service to most crew pleasant meal and wine agreeable. Most satisfied - would look forward to further flights SATA Azores.

We recently travelled to Sao Miguel with 10 members of my family and had a good flight there from the UK. Unfortunately we couldn't fly back to the UK as planned due to the volcanic eruption in Iceland. SATA booked us all into a hotel and provided meals for 5 days at their expense until we could be repatriated. A First class service! Well done.

Boston to Azores was on time and a fine flight but the way back was a disaster. Our flight was supposed to take off at 5:45 got delayed to 7:45 delayed again until 8:30 and we finally took off round 10:30pm. This was not due to weather or any unforeseen circumstances it was all SATA's doing. The flight was half full so we think they were trying to get another feeder flight into the flight from Lisbon to make the flight more profitable. Apparently the same thing happened to the flight earlier in the week. They covered dinner at the Ponta Delgada Airport which was nice but they did not cover anything else. We missed our connection in Boston had to stay overnight (at our own cost) and pay higher fees for new tickets the next morning. They said that is was not their policy to cover any other travel issues for any of their customers even if the issues were caused by SATA. Interesting that they promised to upgrade us to Business Class if it was available but when the time came they said they could not - even though seats were available. They said that there were not enough Business Class dinners and as a result they could not let anyone sit in those seats (even if the passengers didn't care to have dinner or were OK with a Coach Class dinner). We were both surprised and astonished but could do nothing since they are the only carrier that goes to the Azores. We will try to avoid this airline at all costs. You should do the same they clearly do not understand the meaning of basic customer service.

Boston to Lisbon and back. The flights were on time. Pleasant crew and food great. Felt very relaxed all the way. The price is the best you could find for this time of the year. I would recommend SATA airlines.

### SATA Air Azores customer review
SATA have just reduced their two weekly flights from London to PDL to one per week from June 2009 and will not be offering Winter 2009/10 flights. The situation occurred due to the excessive flight prices on average £280-£350 return and is so uncompetitive that flights are running half empty. You can fly to Asia or Canada for the same price. The service on board SATA I found to be very good and quite relaxed but not reflective of the price. With a bit of foresight and good marketing this could be a very successful route. There is currently no other competition except for a code share with TAP which offers the same expensive fare. What a great shame for everyone especially the islands which are beautiful but trapped with only one uncompetitive airline living in a bygone era of state control.

### SATA Air Azores customer review
I used them when travelling between Madeira and Las Palmas/Gran Canaria. Plane was a BAe quite old and uncomfortable although they are currently renovating their fleet. Absolutely no food except water or juices in 1.5hrs and paying a considerable expensive price. Not value for money at all.

Manchester to Ponta Delgada Sao Miguel. Sadly the plane was less than one-fifth full. They deserve better. The crew were attentive very pleasant and very helpful with a never-ending supply of free drinks as well as an adequate meal. I would definitely travel with SATA again.

### SATA Air Azores customer review
Manchester to Ponta Delgada via Gatwick. Crew friendly and onboard service was excellent. Newspapers meals and drinks all included in the price of £175 return. I had a nice Portuguese wine and was offered a second drink. On the return the chicken was a bit overcooked but other than that 2 enjoyable flights - something that is rare these days.

SATA My husband & I flew to the Acores return. The flight crews were helpful and pleasant and food was what you would expect on a flight. When winds did not allow our flight from Faial to Flores to depart we were put up in and excellent hotel where SATA paid for all meals and accommodation. Outstanding service!

### SATA Air Azores customer review
I fly to San Miguel a minimum of two times a year. Overall I find the service good. However pricing of the fare is substantial given the distance 4.5 hour flight and summer rates averaging in access of $800. Winter rates are within the affordable range. If the Azorean government is serious about promoting tourism in the Azores it needs to aggressively address the monopolistic status it grants Azores Express. By having another airline share this lucrative route travelers will have selection of service and potentialy enjoy lower airfares. This could translate in increase tourism to the Azores.

### SATA Air Azores customer review
Several years ago I made a very negative submission about this airline. I now travel monthly with them from London Gatwick direct to Ponta Delgada. The service is now good and a great improvement. The only negative is with reference to the price of tickets which are still outrageously high. Another curious experience is the use of Christmas music being played even in high summer? If you send an e-mail with reference to an enquiry they can take up to a month to reply in awful cut and paste English with little comment on the initial complaint or request - call them instead!

Recently flew Sata Internacional from Amsterdam tot Ponta Delegada and return and the experience was very good. On time clean and modern A320 aircraft and friendly staff. Free newspapers headsets hot meal and bar service. Inter island flights with SATA Air Azores were mostly slightly delayed and are basic with free seating and no inflight service whatsoever (except for the occasional local newspaper) but got us from A to B safely.

### SATA Air Azores customer review
Me and my wife went on a trip from Lisbon to Ponta Delgada. Our experience was poor. For a 346 Euros (one-way) each person on a 2 hours flight a bad sandwich was served the flight attendants made a big effort on smiling and the planes are very old. The bad news is that they are the only airline that flies to S.Miguel.

### SATA Air Azores customer review
Flew out of Toronto direct flight to Sao Miguel- three hours late. Gate change occurred due to late takeoff. When announcement was made for passengers to board there were no Sata personnel to board the passengers. Much confusion was evident. Onboard the cabin crew were miserable and rude to passengers. Little attempt was made to speak English to those passengers who did not speak Portuguese. The meal was not hot nor tasty best part of the meal was the dinner roll and the wine. Most likely will be the last time I fly Sata. There are other airlines who fly direct.
