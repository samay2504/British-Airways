### "No confirmation on refund"
Not Verified |  Tigerair, I have now been waiting since the 31/3/20 for a refund on a flight you cancelled and have answered the same questions 3 times now. That's 6 weeks. No confirmation on refund, no response to paying and when, no call centre to get answers. Zero stars if you even care about that as there's no way to complain!

### "refuse to provide me with a refund"
Perth to Melbourne. Despite cancelling my flight they refuse to provide me with a refund and have credited a different airline without my consent. This is theft. Doesn't help that when I call to ask why I got a smartass telling me that it was "obvious" why this was done, no it isn't obvious, it's theft.

### "number of issues with their website"
Sydney to Brisbane. First time flying with Tigerair. Would only consider them again as a last resort. Airside they bunched all their flights right into one corner so the queue was twice as long and there were no seats. Had a number of issues with their website being dysfunctional in terms of not sending and viewing boarding passes. Not being able to login to several features such as to book flights, manage flights etc using their mobile app but just managing to get in with the desktop site. When I was about to show the e-pass at the gate the mobile website failed to display due to the server being busy. It was not possible to save a copy of the pass to my phone wallet either. Luckily I got a printed one just in case. One thing I was looking forward to was the tigertainment entertainment system which on their website is available on all aircraft. Sadly this was not available on my flights. No wifi signal let alone logging in. No mention of this made onboard. Onboard menu food options had limited options listed but none were available. I was a front row passenger on my flight to Brisbane but even with this my legs were cramped. Cabin crew did nothing to deter someone using one of the spare front seats to wait for the toilet instead of standing even though they hadnt paid for it. My return flight to Sydney was rescheduled a few days before to an earlier time slot and it was a pain having to wait and call them to reselect my seat.

### "$75 for the excess weight"
Brisbane to Sydney. The Airport crew in Brisbane were absolutely rude, demanding and disrespectful. My cabin bag weighted 8.1kg, it should have been 7kg, all good, my bad. The desk lady demanded I pay $75 for the excess weight, I said to her I can take items out and put them in the bin as I did not need them. She said no, there is no time you need to pay now and give the bag to the ground crew. I said it will take me 2mins to take the items out. She again said "theres no time". I looked at her as she checking other paying customers whom she could rip off before she got the EFT POS machine that took her 5 mins to operate. By this time 10+mins had passed and I repeatedly told her, after all your mucking around I could have taken the excessive weight out of my bag, got on the plane and avoided the $75. I will never fly this airline, pay the extra dollars to be treated like a human, its worth it.

### "The staff were courteous"
I flew one way from Melbourne to Canberra. I paid extra $15 for more leg room and extra $15 for priority boarding. It came to $140. The flight left on time and arrived on time. The seat was comfortable. The staff were courteous. Based on my experience I wouldn't hesitate to fly with this airline again.

### "never fly this unprofessional airline"
Gold Coast to Melbourne. Absolutely shocking, will never fly with this unprofessional airline again. I tried checking into my flight online a few hours before the flight left, their app would not let me. I also tried using webjet which just rejected my check in. I had no luggage with me, so I had planned to get everything I needed to get done in Gold Coast before my flight - and walk on smoothly 45 minutes before it departed, however because of their online check in not working and being put on hold for an hour just to ask someone to assist over the phone, I missed my flight. Nobody cared to help me out or even compensate me in the slightest way for their website and app faults. The man at the counter just informed me that if you don’t have an allocated seat on the flight, your check in online won’t work. Great thanks for the heads up I would love to see where that is outlined for their passengers to follow. The next flight was a few hours later for $95, I am only a student and would rather pay $250 to get onto a Jetstar/Qantas flight so that I never have to deal with them again.

### "Useless and unprofessional"
Adelaide to Melbourne. The formula 1 Melbourne was cancelled. I tried contacting their call centre to change my plans but the first time after holding for 20 mins I could not do it anymore. The next day I tried again. After 15 min someone picked up, but while I tried to explain my situation they just hung up. Useless and unprofessional service.

### "Totally unreliable"
Sydney to Melbourne. Totally unreliable. Pay the extra money to fly another airline. I have used them a couple of times, they are typically delayed or cancelled, so this is not a one off incident. The flight I was meant to be on hasn't even left Melbourne yet. We were meant to have left Sydney 20min ago. The Tiger website is still showing our departure time as 20:40. It's now 21:05. The ground crew at Sydney airport are useless, totally unhelpful.

### "rude and disrespectful"
Brisbane to Sydney. Our first flight got canceled and My wife forgot to check in online for the other flight. We showed up at the airport 45 minutes before our plane left. They said they couldn’t check us in because paperwork has been submitted and she could not alter it, as she can get a $35 fine. Service is rubbish, they don’t even try and help. Very rude and disrespectful. I’d rather pay $200 more per flight so I don’t have to deal with such disrespectful people. Both women were rude and I ended up paying $200 more for another airliner.

### "refunds not provided for change of mind"
Not Verified |  Absolutely ridiculous refund policies. I had no need for a flight I had booked and wanted to cancel with a weeks notice only to be told that refunds are not provided for change of mind. Consideration of circumstances out of control should be considered here and refusing a refund when given suitable notice is abhorrent. I now have to make a trip just to avoid wasting my money. I will not fly with Tigerair ever again, lesson learned.

### "Very poor customer service"
We had booked a flight with Tigerair Australia for our soccer team to fly out from Sydney to Melbourne on Friday the 6th March 2020 for a soccer tournament. This flight was booked on the 20th of February 2020. After checking in the day before, we received a message from Tigerair on Friday the 6th of March at 9:30 am informing us that our flight has been cancelled "due to poor weather conditions" and that they had put us on the next a available flight which was on Saturday the 7th of March at 3:40 pm. However, we had already booked our hotel for Friday and our first soccer match of the tournament was on Saturday 11 am. After calling their customer service, we were told that they could not do anything about it other than provide a flight credit valid for 6 months. They also told us that we will not be given a refund as they cannot control the poor weather conditions. We were forced to book a last minute flight on the same day (Friday 6th of March) costing us $400 one way with Virgin Australia Airlines. It is interesting to know that only Tigerair had cancelled their flights for that day and no other airline did. Very poor customer service and will not book with them ever again. I hope they go bankrupt and in liquidation. It is also interesting that Tiger Airways Australia is a wholly owned subsidiary of Virgin Australia. Something fishy was definitely going on as the weather was perfectly fine on that day (both in Sydney and Melbourne).

### "Very bad service"
Brisbane to Melbourne. Pathetic service. Sitting in the plane for the next 20 mins and the air conditioning is not switched on. It is stuffy and when requested to the air hostess, she asks us to remove our jackets. Very bad service.

### "$46 for being half a kilo over"
Brisbane to Canberra. Gate staff need to be trained in the basics of customer service not only do they harass the final few passengers but when I had my cabin bagg weighed and was over by 500 grams I was told to either leave something behind or find another airline. I was then charged $46 for being half a kilo over because I was told it would unbalance the plane. I didn’t really care about the 46 dollars more just the attitude and lack of flexibility by gate staff, all good though, you just lost my business for good.

### "flights delayed or cancelled"
Not Verified |  Brisbane to Sydney. Absolute disgrace of an airline. We will never fly with Tigerair Australia again. The staff at Brisbane have no customer service skills, flights delayed or cancelled. They may advertise cheap flights but believe me you will pay for it in the end

### "Not at all impressed"
Not Verified |  My son and partner flew to Melbourne this morning on a 9am flight. Last night, they did an online check in but received an online notification that the flight would depart at 9.30am not 9am as scheduled. They therefore asked us to take them to the airport half an hour later, ie. to check in their luggage by 8.30am not 8am. We arrived at the airport at around 8.20am and found the check in counters were already closed and all Tiger air staff vacated the area so there was no one to ask anything of. A Virgin airways employee explained that as they had received only google notification of the schedule delayed flight and not an email from Tiger Airways direct, they needed to arrive to check in their luggage at the original scheduled time, ie. by 8am. They were told they needed to take their luggage through the screening area and talk to the Tigerair staff at the gate, which they did. It ended up costing each of them $75 extra to have their luggage admitted from the tarmac. There were several other people in the same situation and one was unable to go on the flight as he hadn't checked in online. I was shocked at the dreadful service, given the fact that the flight was delayed and Tiger Airways knew of this the previous evening when my son and partner were notified, albeit by a 'google notification' rather than Tiger direct. I felt it was a very cynical grab at an extra charge from the customer, taking advantage of the fact that many people would have been confused by such a scenario. Not at all impressed and the situation deepened my personal commitment never to use Tiger Airways!

### "No customer service at all"
Not Verified |  Staff at Brisbane are very rude. No customer service at all. As we only had carry on luggage they weighed my partner and my bags together and said it was less than 1kg overweight so would have to pay $38. I said that is ridiculous amount for less than 1kg. They told us we could go thru our bags and reduce the weight. So we both took some clothes out of our bag and put them on and the bag was considered fine. The same weight was still going on the plane and they knew that. So you can't tell me the weight restrictions and penalty for it is not just a money grabbing exercise from this airline. Plane was delayed but no announcement were made about that. The ground staff really need to learn customer service and smiling and acknowledging passengers would be a good start.

### "Never flying with Tigerair again"
Not Verified |  I was informed that the return Flight will be delayed by 3.5 hours, and there was no way to change it as it falls within the 4 hour period that they deem acceptable. I was basically forced to accept the delay or waste my ticket. While boarding the staff made me weigh my laptop bag, which came as a shock since laptop bags and ladies purses are never counted under cabin baggage limits. My hand bag was 7kg which was the limit but they forced me to get an upgrade for $46 to carry my laptop bag on board, which weighed 1.5kg. Never flying with Tigerair again.

### "customer care are non existent"
Not Verified |  Canberra to Brisbane. Wish we had read other reviews before wasting my money on this pathetic excuse for an airline. Service and customer care are non existent. Absolute joke.

### "plane has been delayed for 5 hours"
Sitting here waiting at Gold Coast airport for return flight home to Melbourne, plane has been delayed for 5 hours. This is the third time in a few weeks that this has happened, one of which ended up eventually being cancelled/notified at 10pm after several delays and hanging around the airport for over 6 hours. Half expecting the same thing again today, we’ll see. Meanwhile 4 planes (Virgin, Jetstar flights) have left for Melbourne. Will never ever travel Tigerair again.

### "not aware of a strict weight allowance"
Not Verified |  We booked two flights with Tigerair, the first on Feb. 11 from Brisbane to Cairns. We were not aware of a strict weight allowance that only permitted 30 kilos to be checked for 2 passengers and 14 kilos for carry-ons. These restrictions cost us over an hour of moving weight around from checked luggage to carry ons in order to avoid the ridiculous and unnecessary change of $25 per kilos extra which would have amounted to more then twice the cost of each of our tickets! As it was, we were forced to pay an additional $94 to take the extra 10 kilos on board in two extra carry-ons. This was completely pointless as the flight was half empty and the plane will still take on the extra weight as long as we pay for it. Moreover, the help staff was rude and deceptive. Jan was forced to put her purse on the scale which put us over the limit by .02 kilos and cost an additional $47. We are dreading our next flight on February 19th when we will again have to face this same ugly experience. We are professional travelers on a 10 month journey and most of the weight in our luggage is necessary prescription drugs. All this after this flight has already been changed twice causing us to adversely change our plans.

### "Customer services are so rude"
Not Verified |  Sydney to Melbourne. Don’t ever fly with TigerAir Australia. They sent customers to other airline without solving problem. After waiting for 3 hours of flight delayed it ended up being cancelled. The board was not even showing the flight was being cancelled. Customer services are so rude.

### "delayed over 3 hours"
Brisbane to Adelaide. Do not bother flying with this airline. I decided to fly with this flight as it was cheap and was one of the earliest flights. I am still waiting to board after being delayed over 3 hours already which means I could've chosen a later flight and still arrived earlier then I am going to.

### "extra $46 to take my carryon"
Melbourne to Brisbane. Worst airline I’ve flown with. I’ve never seen an airline with a carry on weight limit and they made me pay an extra $46 to take my carryon onto the plane. I will never travel with this airline again.

### "Service was ordinary"
We went from Sydney to Melbourne and the flight was delayed 90mins. Upon return from Melbourne to Sydney, the flight was delayed again after we boarded the plane. The delay while seated and plane not moving was 40mins. This was after an already 40min delay. So a total of 80min delay. And overall the seating allocation was really bad. Some rows had 6 people and full. some rows had 2 people and empty. Service was ordinary.

### "Everything went totally fine"
Not Verified |  Cairns to Melbourne. I have seen a lot of negative reviews about Tigerair so myself and my girlfriend were apprehensive about booking with them and were fully prepared for delays. We were both pleasantly surprised. Everything went totally fine, the case limit for check in bags was only 15kg so be careful with that but our flight left and arrived on time. No complaints. Good experience.

### "Worst service ever"
Departing from Melbourne to Gold Coast, I arrived at the airport at 6 am, I miss my flight because something happened at the security gate. I tried to explain the situation otherwise, no one helped us or tried to give us a solution. Different that you have to pay full price. So I had to pay 180$ for the next flight. There were so rude & unaccommodating. I had to wait at the airport for the next flight at 12:20, then the flight was delayed, no explanation, nothing! They made things as difficult as possible for us. We will never use Tigerair  again I would not recommend it. Worst service ever, bad service, always delayed!

### "lack of assistance from customer support"
My flight from Adelaide to Melbourne was cancelled less than 48 hours before intended departure. The airlines offered alternative flights with Virgin Atlantic for the same day but that didn't meet my purpose of travel as it wasn't arriving in time for my pre-booked appointment, which couldn't be rescheduled. I called the customer support team and advised that Virgin had another flight on the same day which arrives on time for my appointment and requested to be booked on that. The customer support team was not helpful at all and advised that all they could do was refund my ticket (AUD$85), and asked me to book a new ticket myself which at this point costed AUD$180. Finally, I made a request for refund of balance of fare, for which Tigerair was solely responsible, and after 3 weeks of exchanging emails I was told that the airlines was not going to take my claim further. Why offer and confirm tickets when you can't fulfill your responsibility? Worst experience ever compounded further by lack of assistance from the customer support team.

### "never use your airline again"
Gold Coast to Sydney. My husband, my 3 children & I have been stuck here at Gold Coast Airport for 7 hours because we just happened to have a nasty attendant who could have let us on the flight as it still had 45 mins before the plane took off & I had checked in on my phone but when we arrived she said we hadn’t! She said last check in was 2 minutes ago. Now she could have done the right thing & with 45 mins to spare (& we had only carry on bags) checked us in or made my family & I book another airline at a cost of $600 & get home at midnight! She chose to make us book Jetstar who couldn’t have been kinder and did as much as they could to help us. Tigerair were both So rude & unaccomodating, they made things as difficult as possible for us. We will never use your airline again.

### "it isn't unbearable for 2 hours"
Evening flight out of Brisbane back to Melbourne on TT535. On time departure, cabin crew were attentive, the lack of inflight entertainment or wifi wasn't a major inconvenience seeing the flight was only 2 hours in duration. The seats are not spacious or ergonomically great for sitting in but again, it isn't unbearable for 2 hours. I had the middle seat, 20E, though I would have liked a window seat, I wasn't phased. I occupied myself with listening to music, and food wise, there is the option to purchase light food/drinks .

### "punctual with no delays"
Not Verified |  Brisbane to Melbourne. The flight back to Melbourne was an evening flight. This was great as I had technically had a whole day to travel around before heading home. The flight was punctual with no delays. I didn't have any gripes or anything significantly negative, although I would at the very least of liked a window or aisle seat instead of being squished in the middle. Tigerair doesn't have inflight entertainment, inflight wifi or complimentary meals. However since it was bang on 2 hours, I don't need inflight entertainment or wifi for this short of a trip neither a complimentary meal. Cabin crew were attentive and there is the option to purchase food and beverages on their flights.

### "late by 5 minutes for check in"
Brisbane to Melbourne. I will never use this airline again, horrible rules of checkin. I was late by 5 minutes for check in time and I had to pay 180$ for next flight.

### "I asked for a refund"
Not Verified |  Melbourne to Sydney. I chose extra leg room for my flight and based on the seating map. The map showed a big gap in front of row 14 as this is misleading to customers. But real life that’s not the case it’s misleading. Why would we move to the a different seating if there aren’t any extra space. I asked for a refund but the customer service declined.

### "never recommend this airline"
I wish I could give this airline a zero star, cutting long story short the my flight was delayed for 8 hours than canceled. The airline representative told us to book your own hotel and we'll cover up to $120 for accommodation. I did pay for my accommodation but after several emails with no reply they denied any refund. Would never recommend this airline to anyone.

### "I was too late to check in"
Not Verified |  Sydney to Brisbane. Tried to online check in before hand but the system wasn't working, got there 50mins before flight, then got to the kiosk at the airport where that equipment wasn't working, then had to line up as nothing was working, then told at the counter that I was too late to check in. 5-10 people were turned away for the same reason.

### "no compensation, no apology"
Melbourne to Gold Coast. Tigerair is a company i will never fly with again. On the way to the gold coast, the plane was delayed 1 hour, they had everyone sitting in the plane on a 40 degree day due to mechanical issues of some sort? I was frustrated but i get it, planes get delayed all the time. On the way back from gold coast to Melbourne however, our plane got delayed for 4 hours. 4 hour delay and no compensation, no apology. On their website it clearly states in their T'c & C's that if their plane is delayed for 4 hours or more and is their fault then Customers get compensation. Tigerair's reason for the 4 hour delay was that there is 'mechanical issues'. Called up customer support numerous times asking for a refund but all they could say is "you still boarded the flight". I was pushed around and told to email their support team, they were no help whatsoever. So frustrating, so rude and so unprofessional.

### "no apology, no compensation, no assistance"
Will never use again. Weather delays interrupted all flights on Wed 15 Jan. My daughter (17) was traveling alone. 8 hours of poor communication on the ground, conflicting information on boards/website/helpline. Other flights were delayed by 2-3 hours, not 8 hours! They refused to have a staff member reassure my unaccompanied minor daughter after 6 hours of delay. She was given one $5 food voucher - not the $5 voucher every 3 hours promised by the helpline. Upon final arrival in Hobart the suitcase was drenched through. Clothing took more than 24 hours to dry. Response from Tigerair - no apology, no compensation, no assistance for an unaccompanied minor is a stressful situation. Only one $5 food voucher in 8 hours. That doesn’t even buy 2 sushi rolls at the airport. Will not fly with Tigerair again.

### "long delays should be expected"
Never again on Tigerair. Our flight from Sydney to Gold Coast was delayed for 7 hours from 12:00 pm to 6:25 pm which took off at 7:05 pm. All they could do is offering us a refund on a condition that we fly with another airline which was impossible to find. When I complained they never apologized but instead they said: “this is a budget airline” which means that long delays should be expected. It was more disappointing that they offered us $15 vouchers per person for lunch and diner. And they had the guts to sell drinks on board instead of giving complimentary drinks due to the 7 hours delay.

### "arrived 8 hrs 3 mins late
Hobart to Melbourne. We arrive at afternoon 1:30pm to check in. Only one hour trip and we arrived 8 hrs 3 mins late. The airplane delay till middle night time 12. When we went to asked staff reason, they said that Tigerair Australia is budget airline. So what? Budget doesn't mean terrible and unavailable.

### "Never again on Tigerair"
Never again on Tigerair. Our flight from Sydney to Gold Coast was delayed for 7 hours from 12:00pm to 6:25pm which took off at 7:05pm. All they could do is offering us a refund on a condition that we fly with another airline which was impossible to find. When I complained they never apologized but instead they said “this is a budget airline” which means that long delays should be expected. It was more disappointing that they offered us $15 vouchers per person for lunch and diner. And they had the guts to sell drinks on board instead of giving complimentary drinks due to the 7 hours delay.

### "Horrible customer service"
Melbourne to Sydney. Horrible customer service. I understand you get what you pay for however based on how horridly unhelpful the supervisor was today (3:30pm on  11th January), I will never fly Tiger again. I understand the person I dealt with is possibly not working in what the would call their ideal job but I personally felt they took that out on me. No matter how cheap your flights are this isn’t good enough. Life sucks but people like this (and the workplace environments that enable them) make it worse.

### "charge totally unjustified"
I had no baggage to check in on my flight on Tiger Air Australia TT513/30dec 2019 from Brisbane to Melbourne. I had 1 piece handbag weighing 7.5kgs and a purse weighing 1.5 kgs. At the boarding gate I was asked to put both my handbag and purse on the scale and the total being 9 kgs, staff demanded I pay excess baggage of AUD 46 for 2 kgs excess weight. I said I’d dispose of my water bottle and bubble wrap and bits and bobs but they refused saying that there was a long queue behind me and I had to pay if I wanted to catch my flight. This was 30 minutes prior to take-off. They took cash and have not issued any receipt. This is unaccounted money being taken from their passengers. After making several complaints to their customer portal for a refund as this charge for a purse is totally unjustified they have flatly refused to see reason. This airline needs to be grounded based on the negative reviews they have received.

### "flights are always delayed"
Sydney to Melbourne. Such bad services in Australia, Domestic flights are always delayed. I have been travelling since September to December fortnight with Tigerair but not a single trip my flight was on time. We had booked overseas connecting flight from Sydney to Melbourne flight was at 11:30am when we landed we got a message that it is delayed to 2:45pm such a long delay our entire day is water we had to sit at the entrance for so dam long hours with out luggage and when asked at the counter the people working for tiger air just don’t care, worst services. better to pay little extra then travelling with Tigerair. Respect customer time , 30 minutes 60 minutes delay is understood but 3 hours. This is nonsense. Lesson learned hard way. Never travel with Tigerair . This will be my last flight with this  airline.

### "messing us around again"
Not Verified |  Melbourne to Sydney cancelled. Thanks Tiger for messing us around again. Up early to get flight. Two adults and four children. Flight cancelled. Poor notification. Walked to Tiger terminal to be told to go back to Virgin Terminal. Now on a Virgin flight. Go to Virgin. They know nothing about it. Waiting waiting. Two hours later still not checked in.

### "delayed from 12:00pm to 6:25pm"
Not Verified |  Our flight from Sydney to Gold Coast got delayed from 12:00pm to 6:25pm! And would only give us a refund if we fly with another airline which was impossible to find a flight that wouldn’t get us there late afternoon. All they gave us was a $5 voucher per person for lunch and dinner. We have had flights with them before and never had problem.

### "flight got cancelled"
Melbourne to Adelaide. My brother and his family supposed to travel from Melbourne to Adelaide on 3 January 2020 at 3:40pm. The flight got cancelled due to technical issues. He has to catch a bus from Adelaide 6pm to his place which he already paid, So he explained the situation to the ground staff and they were rude and said if he wants they can give the refund or fly on the next flight at 6:15pm. He asked them to postpone the ticket to next day, but they said they can’t and told him to get the refund and fly on a different flight, so bad experience, will never fly on Tigerair any more.

### "original flight got cancelled"
Adelaide to Melbourne. Worst airline I have ever travelled. My original flight got cancelled which was scheduled at 1705 after waiting in the airport for 1 hour. We got another flight on request at 1945. That was delayed to 2035 and I reached there 1 hour before the flight time and I was told to pay $75 each to check in baggage as they are closed 1 hour before the original time of the flight. Even though it was delayed.

### "flight got delayed twice"
Adelaide to Melbourne. If there was a number zero there, be reassured I would use it. Our flight got delayed twice. We were supposed to fly at 2:55 pm then delayed to 6:20 pm and then again to 7:55 pm. I have been spending more than half day at the airport, money for no reason while I could’ve enjoyed my free time somewhere else! You are entitled to a refund only if you give up your seat .. what a scam! !

### "misleading the consumer"
Melbourne to Adelaide. TigerAir are still selling tickets online for 2.55pm to Melbourne when it has been delayed until 6.20pm .. how can this be legal? I call it trickery and out right misleading the consumer!

### "didn’t allow me to enter"
Not Verified |  I booked last minute ticket from Canberra to Melbourne. The web check in was not available and they closed their check in even though I reached on time. I waited in the door the flight got delayed and they still didn’t allow me to enter. Customers are last priority for them. Not very helpful and friendly.

### "Worst flying experience"
Brisbane to Melbourne. Worst flying experience in 30 years due to the attitude of an individual ground staff member who turned her back on me mid sentence and when I remarked that I considered the level of customer service inadequate. I was told “if you don’t like it choose another airline”. If you choose to fly Tigerair (which I never will do again) be prepared for a business model designed to extract every last cent from the passenger without any provision for service. I’ve flown budget airlines all over the world but this I’ve is unique in a very unfortunate way.

### "fly with a more reliable airline"
Sydney to Melbourne. Booked a flight to Melbourne to coincide with a friend travelling from Seattle. Tiger cancelled my flight, 1.5 hours before departure. Was told I was going to be placed on a Virgin flight but this was not true. Avoid Tigerair at all costs. Pay the extra and fly with a more reliable airline. I fly a lot and never again using Tiger.

### "a joke of an airline"
Not Verified | Sydney to Melbourne. Terrible carrier - avoid flying if possible. Flight cancelled at last minute but passengers must do the follow-up and necessary checking. Customer service almost useless, can't give specific details about checking in and can't promise that previous flight entitlements will still apply. Truly a joke of an airline.

### "they are the worst"
Definitely they are the worst. Other than the poor quality of flight and seats, their customer service is terrible. They canceled their last flight from Melbourne to Sydney at the last minute due to their issues and were not responsible at their check-in counters. They even didn't cover the costs it caused like taxi & hotel costs, and their excuse was the weather issue, however, no flights from Melbourne to Sydney canceled that day and 2 more flights operated just 5 & 15 minutes by other Airlines after Tigerair flight got canceled. Please note that although they might have cheap flight prices at first glance, the other expenses they will cause, make you get the most expensive option for the lowest quality.

### "two cancellations for the same route in 6 months"n
Not Verified |  Booked the airline to travel from Sydney to Melbourne twice in 6 months. Both got cancelled. I got rebooked on the flight departing the next day for the first cancellation which causes me to lose a night of accommodation in Melbourne. Not sure why I decided to travel with Tiger again on my next trip to Melbourne which is also another cancellation. But I got quickly upgraded to Virgin flight that departs at the same time so no complaint this time. But their cancellation rate must have been really high for me to encounter two cancellations for the same route in 6 months. Not recommended.

### "Absolutely terrible airline"
Melbourne to Goldcoast. Absolutely terrible airline, don't waste your money flying with them. Delayed flight big time with no time of departure given, due to antiquated planes with mechanical faults. When finally allowed to depart after 3 hrs flight to Goldcoast changed to brisbane, with a 1 he bus trip to gold coast. Poor lazy staff Never ever ever again Tigerair Not worth the money Virgin or qantas from now on.

### "ended up missing my flight"
Gold Coast to Melbourne. Ground staff and customer service call centre are useless, had issues with my bags and was told staff would meet me at the desk. They never showed up I waited over half hour with the airport help desk calling them twice and ended up missing my flight.

### "I was so grateful"
Not Verified |  I left my iPhone in the check in kiosk. My husband and I were being helped by Tan who retagged our bags and was so helpful. Once I was through security I realized I’d left my phone on the checkin kiosk. I made my way back to Tiger checkin but no phone. Staff  was extremely sympathetic and helpful. I then visited airport security also helpful. They sent me to the TigerAir main desk. Two women there contacted Tan personally and he had found my phone and told them exactly where he’d secured it. Back to Tiger Air checkin and they had my iPhone. I was so grateful I cried. To a person everyone at Tiger Air was concerned and helpful! Thank you from a forgetful American.

### "Do not recommend at all"
Melbourne to Adelaide. I had a ticket to Adelaide and I was in the airport 2 hours before to get boarding but 1 hour before flight time I received SMS flight is canceled. My return ticket was for same day at 6pm and they gave me replacement flight at 2.40pm same day which it wasn't work. I lost almost $500 for 2 way ticket and 2 way taxi fee and at end they just paid $70. Do not recommend at all.

### "carrier is of very poor quality"
Not Verified |  Sydney to Melbourne. The staff were helpful but our 7am plane was cancelled at 10.15pm the night before and rescheduled to 2:30pm. The plane was further delayed for over an hour due to technical issues. The seats were really uncomfortable and there's no room for anyone over 5'8". Aside from the air hostesses, the carrier is of very poor quality. I would not use this service if you need to someone by a certain time. There are many reviews that state the same issues.

### "not choose them in the future"
Brisbane to Adelaide. Today, I arrived before the luggage check-in was supposed to close. However, it was already closed when I scanned my boarding pass. I wanted to talk to a Tigerair staff who was on another machine next to me. I was waiting next to her but she was quite rude in her tone while addressing me. I waited for my turn after she dealt with 2 clients. I presented my ticket and she told me that she closed the check-in 5 minutes before. I explained to her that I arrived on time and that it was already closed and then I had to wait to talk to her, but she remained inflexible and of course didn't seem to care and to listen to what I was saying. I therefore had to pay for another flight for tomorrow. I saw three other people who had to pay for another ticket, because they were also "late" for the luggage check-in. Tigerair advertises the fact that they have cheaper fares but when you have to pay your ticket twice, it is not a good bargain at all. I will certainly not choose them in the future.

### "unprofessional service"
Melbourne to Sydney. Declined my father’s ticket because of a glitch in their system with his check in. Even though he had proof of a paid ticket and assigned seat. Gave us no resolution or explanation and sent him home. Stuck in the plane for 42 minutes with no air con or water before take off. Wouldn’t let me use the rest room either. Inhumane conditions and unprofessional service.

### "the ticket is not refundable"
Sydney to Gold Coast. I received an email saying that my flight was delayed and when I got to the gate they said it wasn’t and that I missed my flight although the door to the plane was still open and the rail was still attached. While I was talking to staff at the gate she starts arguing that I’m not checked in which I was and after checking and she finding out that I was she tells me they offloaded me and while I was talking to her she tells them to close the gate. After sending me to 3 different people and talking to the customer service over the phone they tell me there’s nothing they can do and the ticket is not refundable and if I want I can purchase a new ticket.

### "Extremely rude staff"
Brisbane to Melbourne. Extremely rude staff working very slow in order to delay customers boarding the flight. Then did not allow to board the flight saying I am 5 min late and tried to sell a new ticket for $220. It is a revenue-generating scam. I managed to change my flight to the next day for $80 without buying a new ticket. Next day when I arrived much earlier they weighed in the hand bag as well and because it was 1kg overweight charged me $40. I have never had a worse experience with an airline ever. I travel 6 to 8 times a year and will never travel Tigerair again. This is truly the worst. This strategy they use will be their demise. Disgusting staff and disgusting airline.

### "do not book Tigerair"
Melbourne to Brisbane. No hassle flying to Melbourne however departing is a different story. Original departing flight delayed, then cancelled and no other flights available for two days. At this rate, we had been at the airport for 6 hours, it was nearly midnight and no accommodation was available as they were completely booked out. Our flight was now scheduled two days later. Not only did we have to find accommodation an hour away, but we had to pay an extra $550. Next, our new flight get delayed and then we miss our flight due to the sky buses taking two hours to get to the airport (We will take the blame for that part because we should have researched). So we finally arrive, flight missed but still optimistic because the service desk lady told us there would be another flight available at 1. The lady at the service desk then asks us to come back 30 mins later to book the new flight. When we come back, she tells us we cannot book the flight because it’s full and check-in time is closed. Why tell us to come back when the check-in time would be closed and the flight is booked out? Anyway, the next available flights are nearly $400 each. Two emotional breakdowns and new flight tickets later, we are finally coming home with Jetstar. If you want to keep your sanity and have a hassle-free flight that doesn’t include wasting an extra $600 because of cancelled flights then do not book Tigerair. Might I add, when we were stranded at the airport at midnight after the cancelled flight, visibly shaken because we are young girls that are basically homeless, nearly all of the Tigerair employees had left and the one thing they told us was to ‘just book a DiDi for half price’. Thanks Tiger Air.

### "I don't recommend at all"
Melbourne to Sydney. The company cancelled the flight to hours prior departure and hasn’t be able to book me on the next flight so they suggest me a flight the day after. Zero customer service ! The hostess was not patient at all and not comprehensive. I had to book a flight with another company to be on time in Sydney which cost me the double of the initial price. I don't recommend at all.

### "include handbags for weighing"
Not Verified | Brisbane to Adelaide. Put my luggage on the scale at home before leaving it was 7.3kg thought they would consider a bit of excess, was shocked when the crew put it on the scale it was 8kg. They also include handbags for weighing. Never seen anything like this. Worst experience my wife and I ever had. We have to pay $90 and have to bring along our luggage with us.

### "Random delay almost guaranteed"
Not Verified |  Adelaide to Melbourne. Random delay almost guaranteed with Tigerair Australia, haven't flown with them in years but was desperate so I booked them the night before. Just avoid. Asked for a refund and they said no, tried to change to Virgin and again a no. Just use any other airline, not this one.

### "unhygienic conditions and rude staff"
Gold Coast to Melbourne. Service Rep was rude to my 2yr old daughter at check-in and then looked as though she was offended when I snapped back at her. The flight was slightly delayed which was not a big deal at all however, once we actually boarded the plane I was unimpressed. Settling into our seats, it was apparent that the plane was not cleaned before our boarding due to how much rubbish was in the pockets of our seats and the fact that the seat my 2yr old was to sit on was wet. When attempting to gain the attention of one of the flight attendants to get something to wipe the seat with, i was told to wait (she never came to check on us either). I ended up taking off my Cardi and wiping the seat with that and switched seats with my daughter. I understand Tiger is the cheap alternative however, cheap should not equate to unhygienic conditions and rude staff. The likelihood of flying with Tigerair again unless i'm absolutely desperate and this is my last option, is slim to never again at best.

### "Do not purchase the insurance"
Sydney to Gold Coast. Do not purchase the insurance with Chubb Insurance, the recommended insurer by Tiger. I have had the worst experience. After 9 months of being asked for more details, (receipts not efficient enough type them out) (send airline report again) and long delays. Has been the worst experience and obvious that the company has been trying to avoid or find an error which has meant they do not have to pay. I advice getting insurance elsewhere.

### "never fly with this company again"
Melbourne to Brisbane. Stay away from this company. They may sell flights 20-40 dollars cheaper in comparison to Virgin but their service are way worse. I book flight with checked Sport baggage, called them 2 days before to called the sport baggage and was told they don't refund for it, and if I decide to change it to normal luggage allowance I would've pay over $20 for that. So inconsiderate service, total rip off. I will never fly with this company again.

### "overall a nightmare experience"
Not Verified |  Brisbane to Sydney. Travelled with a 6 month old baby and this was the worst service ever experienced. Some of the young ladies employed at Brisbane airport service desk demonstrated zero customer service on our trip to Sydney. They were sarcastic, extremely rude and showed no understanding of what was helpful to a travelling family. I’ve done 8 flights with my daughter on other airlines and this short flight with Tigerair was by far the worst and left me in tears. We also had white stains on the seats in the plane, overall a nightmare experience. Tiger need to train their Brisbane front of house staff in customer service.

### "two kilos over the maximum weight"
Brisbane to Adelaide. At first the flight seemed to be pretty cheap. Perfect for backpackers on a tight budget. But they charge you extra for everything and I don’t expect much comfort when flying on a cheap flight. But due to many additional fees for seat of choice, extra luggage, etc. the flight wasn’t exactly cheap in the end. I paid for extra luggage since i was carrying a suitcase which was perfectly ok. But at the gate they weighted my carry-on and my personal items such as mobile phone, laptop, tablet and even the 1.5l water bottle purchased at the airport. Which is ridiculous. I never had them measuring my personal items before. So i was about two kilos over the maximum weight for the carrier-on and thus had to pay an extra fee for about 45AUD. Not going to fly with them again.

### "Never again will I fly Tigerair"
Not Verified |  Sydney to Melbourne. If I could give a zero I would. Changed my flight departure multiple times without reason, then decided to cancel my flight without reason, when asked about trying to change my flight they made it so difficult and it just didn’t work. Never again will I fly Tigerair.

### "We had a great experience"
Gold Coast to Melbourne. We had a great experience flying with Tigerair. The flight was comfortable, the staff were very friendly and we found it easy to check in and to adjust baggage requirements etc via the app. After reading some of the reviews we were apprehensive about flying with Tigerair but we were pleasantly surprised and will definitely fly with Tigerair in the future. It was my children’s first time on a plane so thanks for the positive experience Tigerair.

### "Worst airline in Australia"
Sydney to Melbourne. Worst airline in Australia. Period. You can expect incorrect reasons given for delays, cramped seats, no inflight service, the worse gates at the airport and a long wait for your baggage.

### "few minutes past the check in time"
Brisbane to Adelaide. I was only a few minutes past the check in time, with no checked luggage, and was rudely refused entry on my flight at the service desk. Myself and 3 other passengers, who arrived within a few minutes of me, were told that all of our seats will fly empty. There was no apology, I was refused to talk to a manager and the only resolve was to wait 24 hours and pay $85. So incredibly disappointed in the clearly flawed system at Tigerair that is just a means of customers paying more money. I would not recommend to anyone and will not be flying with them again.

### "never travel with Tiger again"
Melbourne to Sydney. Travelling home to Coffs Harbour after a family wedding Tiger cancelled our flight due to an apparent Lightning strike. Refund was offered but we were out of pocket $1500.00 due to having to purchase last minute flights to get home. No recovery flight was offered. Pay the extra money at least you will get another flight either the same day or next day. Will never travel with Tiger again. We have learnt our lesson.

### "never travel Tigerair Australia again"
Sydney to Cairns. Just before boarding flight got cancellation notification due to engineering failure - all they mentioned is they will refund money. Will never travel Tigerair Australia again and will definitely recommend friends not to travel with them.

### "Worst customer experience"
Gold Coast to Sydney. Worst customer experience ever. The flight was cancelled, promised refund on 28th September 2019 and no refund amount given yet plus got an email today that you can go seek legal advise if needed. Just there to get money providing pathetic customer support. Will never recommend this airline.

### "I was only 5 min late"
Brisbane to Sydney. Worst airline ever experienced in my life with staff helping with nothing. I was only 5 min late and they didn’t allow me and my family to check in.

### "came late and miss the flight"
Gold Coast to Melbourne. Zero customer service. Staff so rude. First they sell cheap tickets online later they charge money when u check in. Their staff will not help you they will not listen you. We get their on time to board our flight. We was unable to self check in system was not working . We ask for help their staff told us to process to counter where we had a few people ahead they made us wait more then 40 min. And then said sorry you came late and miss the flight.

### "I was 5 mins late for check in"
Not Verified |  Melbourne to Brisbane. I was 5 mins late for the check in and i asked the lady about self check machine not letting me and she told me to go to the help desk, I waited in line like 25 mins and the staff is so unhelpful. If they want they can put me and my wife to the flight there was still 40 mins to depart but because of the unhelpful staff i have to wait and then they ask for another $85 dollars per person but i refused to pay and i want to talk with some one higher position. Wasted my 30 mins over the phone trying to explain. Not helpful airline at all using them first time and last time.

### "charged $120 for additional bag"
Melbourne to Sydney. Shocking service, changed flight twice. Then delayed 2 hours on the day of the flight. Bag slightly overweight charged $120 for additional bag. Do not fly with this airline

### "denied to board our flight"
Melbourne to Cairns. Today myself and my partner were basically denied to board our flight. We had arrived well in advance and we were very diligent in checking which gate needed to board. The actual gate did not appear until extremely late, which admittedly put us off guard. When we finally realised the gate had rappeared we immediately ran towards... we received a call letting us know that the gate was about to close literally one minute before arriving to the gate. The very apathetic staff told us that our bag had been removed (which we had paid for), therefore we were off the flight. We will never travel again with you.

### "Delays after delays"
Sydney to Melbourne. Absolute disgrace to Australia. Read a lot of reviews of it being the worst airline in terms of delays and service but after experiencing it myself I do not recommend anyone to use this airline at all. Delays after delays and all they do is apologize rather than improve the service. Its to pay 30$ more and use another airline.

### "customer service is appalling"
Booked on a flight from Sydney to Gold Coast, 1st October. The flight was cancelled apparently due to engineering issues. The staff were disgraceful in their attitude to passengers affected. They acted like they couldn’t care less and it was a hassle that they had to go out of their way to help. Email sent after check in was meant to close indicating the flight was cancelled. Not even an apology that we were inconvenienced. It cost $1000 to get on another flight with another airline. Tiger Airways you are a disgrace and your customer service is appalling. Never fly with them.

### "Overall couldn’t fault them"
Darwin to Brisbane. Was hesitant about flying with them but given how cheap the tickets were, I decided to give them a go. Overall couldn’t fault them. We left on time, landed early and had no dramas despite it being a full flight. Service was what I expected, courteous and polite. I am a larger person so the seats felt fairly tight but I expected this and it wasn’t too bad. There was no wifi or onboard entertainment but I had my own iPad and had downloaded movies for the trip so didn’t mind. Would I fly with them again, absolutely, especially with how cheap they were compared to other carriers.

### "seems to be focused on anything but customer service"
Canberra to Melbourne with Tigerair Australia. Not amused. From the start a complete nightmare. Booked flight is supposed to leave at 8.15pm, but is delayed until 11.05pm. The email letting people know of this is sent 20 minutes after check in for the flight closed, right as boarding was about to begin. They offered vouchers of refreshments, but only $5 and for a cafe that had already closed! A flight to the same destination managed to take off with only a 20 minute delay and land with about that delay too, but Tiger seems to be focused on anything but customer service.

### "Money hungry"
Not Verified | Brisbane to Canberra. Money hungry. I was on time for my flight, trying to get my ticket out of the machine. I finally found a customer service assistant and she insisted that I missed the check-in time by 2 minutes so that I pay $85.00 for the next service. I then had to travel back to the Sunshine Coast in peak hour, which took 3 times as long, to return in the morning. I also had to pay for an extra days parking at the airport, so I will never fly Tigerair again. I will also be giving all my friends, family and work colleagues the same advice

### "Terrible service"
Coolangatta to Melbourne. I purchased my ticket online and paid extra for seat allocation 29F When I checked in they’d given it to someone else. I spoke to ground staff and staff by phone and both said it happens all of the time if they have a family that they want to seat together. Terrible service. Never again will I give them my business.

### "I missed the check in time"
Melbourne to Sydney. Money hungry. I was on time for my flight, but the customer service insisted that I missed the check in time so that I pay for the next service. Then I found that the flight was already delayed 20 minutes and they could have checked me in. Jetstar never did this.

### "The seats are okay"
Not Verified |  Melbourne to Sydney. Found that the journey was not as bad as people said it would be. Check-in was smooth even though we didn't do it online. The ground staff were okay. I found that both flights including the return, were not delayed or held back a long time, the maximum time we were on the ground was approx 15-20mins after boarding. The seats are okay, they're fine for short-distance trips but it can get squashy as the seats are very close together horizontally and vertically. The attendants seemed as if they didn't want to be there. They were nice enough to handle but  weren't all smiles. I didn't purchase any food.

### "traumatised by their treatment"
Proserpine to Sydney. Flying to Sydney for my fathers funeral. I was 10 minutes late for check in, fair enough though I’m sure they could have helped if they wanted to. But instead of that, they just led me to believe they would. The staff at counter told me to find the Tigerair attendant on the other side of security, so went through with luggage that was originally meant to be checked in but figured they would be letting me board with it, so I allowed security to dispose of some expensive hair cutting scissors and some other stuff. Get there (see that the plane has just landed, they are moving the stairs over) and attendant tells me, ‘No you need to see the attendants at the desk.’ So go back out and see them. They tell me to go back through security again. I know at this point they are just playing games. A nice member of the public tries to help me at this point as I am crying. No one cares still. Go outside and call customer service and watch the plane take off. The customer service attendant was very nice and told me to get their names. I go back in and wait in line and ask another attendant who I hadn’t previously had contact with ‘what is the mans name is over there?’ He says ‘why’ I say I want to make a complaint. He refuses to give it to me despite the fact they are all wearing name tags? All with a smart ass grin on his face. Horrible. I will never fly Tigerair again after this experience. Completely traumatised by their treatment in an already dark time for me.

### "simply not good enough"
Not Verified | Adelaide to Melbourne. All too familiar review for Tigerair but I want to let people know that Tigers word is not final. I had my flight cancelled from Adelaide to Melbourne which I understand things like this happen. What I don’t accept is the way the situation was managed, to be offered a flight 2 days later is simply not good enough, especially because they could see I had a return flight the next day with them. I told the ‘customer service’ operator that I had to get to Melbourne that day as I had a concert to which the response was ‘I understand that’ well clearly she didn’t, as the alternative given was a flight on a Monday when the concert was on a Saturday. I was told there were no other available flights, despite there being another Tigerair flight available online for later in the afternoon. I had to purchase tickets with another carrier, when I returned I sent a claim to Tigerair for my out of pocket expenses (that being the difference between the Tigerair fare and the fare on the other airline, not the full cost of the other tickets). Tiger ‘reviewed’ the information and informed me that I had insufficient evidence to be reimbursed. I think they bank on people giving up at this point, I’m more stubborn than that. A quick Google search and I found the Airline Customer Advocate, one email to them and their tune changed immediately and I was offered the reimbursement straight off the bat, I urge people to use this service and not take Tigerair's response as final.

### "Our flight was cancelled"
Sydney to Gold Coast. I was severely disappointed with the service and service lady. Our flight was cancelled or to engineering or engine failure. The next flight was in 3 or more days. The service lady was quite rude and emotionless. She kept saying that she is sorry, or can understand our frustration, but she said it as if she doesn't care. I wanted a compensation because a full refund just isn't enough. We had booked the star hotel, tickets to wet n wild, dream word, and movie world. We lost so much money and got no compensation. She didn't offer to let us talk to her superiors. She let down a whole family. I was in a group of 11 people, and most of them were kids and we were all let down. We wasted so much money, and time, and everyone was disappointed and upset that they couldn't go to Gold Coast.

### "I will never fly Tigerair again"
Not Verified |  Flight cancelled at very short notice with no alternative flight able to be provided for two entire days. Refund not available for two weeks. Care factor of zero  from the airline. I was stuck in Sydney and needed to pay $700 to return home that day on another airline. I will never fly Tigerair again, cheap fares are no compensation for being stranded.

### "show you attitude if they are at fault"
I always travelled with them this trip coming into Sydney was cancelled 3.30 hours and today 30 September 2019 going back to Brisbane boarded flight on time and then went in the runway. Told technical problem which is radar - these things should be checked in maintenance everyday people like us we boarded this early to be at work on time on a Monday morning I had a salon to open to service a client at 9am I’m not unreliable. The staff are so rude on the floor which is worst at least they should be friendly and help. We have to pay lot if prices if as a passenger we only have 2 kilos over they don’t have mercy on us but when they in fault no drama. They still show you attitude if they are at fault.

### "complaint was flatly rejected"
Not Verified |  Sydney to Gold Coast. Booked with Tiger through their online portal and immediately red flags started appearing. The portal was clunky and glitchy and it took my partner half an hour to add extra baggage as it would not allow us to add for both passengers and kept resetting to default and removing off both. After refreshing and re-adding our info multiple times it finally let us proceed. The next day we added a 'special bag' (bike) for one passenger and finished the payment whereby it was stated multiple times the billing amount would be 35 dollars. Only on checking my bank statement half an hour later did I realise we had been charged 70 dollars for two special bags. I immediately contacted 'customer service' who of course were not able to assist me and instead of apologising and simply removing the extra bag they directed me to fill a generic complaint form. The complaint was flatly rejected and refund denied and the reasoning was 'we can see you booked two' despite the fact we hadn't even flown yet and had no need for the bag. Being essentially called a liar is definitely not my idea of good service and for such a meagre amount of money they could have solved my issue which was caused by a fault in their system and we would have potential flown with them again. However I will not only avoid this company like the plague I will tell everyone I know to pay a few extra dollars and fly with someone else which I'm sure will ultimately (hopefully) cost them much more in the end. Not worth the headache.

### "lived up to its reputation for unreliable service"
Not Verified |  Coolangatta to Melbourne. Tigerair is the most disorganised organisation I have dealt with. My Travel agent calls me following a notification they received 24 hours before my departure that my flight departure is no longer 3.35 pm but is 6.05 pm. Because of car hire I have to return to the airport at 3.30 pm or incur additional fees. I check Tigerair website on the morning of my departure and it says I am departing at the original time of 3.35pm. Confused I call a Tigerair consultant you again tells me the departure time is 3.35 pm after checking the company website. When I query that and tell them of the alert I had received about my flight being delayed the consultant makes a deeper investigation and then confirms the update is correct the departure time is 6.05 pm. The fact the consultants depend on a website that is not properly maintained to give accurate information to travellers is maddening. Tigerair has lived up to its reputation for unreliable service and I will not be flying with them again.

### "rude and unpleasant experience"
Sydney to Melbourne. When travelling to Sydney, the experience was okay! However flying from Sydney to Melbourne, the supervisor checking in the bags at weight scale, was rude! she started questioning me are u going to feel that cold that you are carrying a jacket? i was like its going to be cold in Melbourne at night, and she was embarrassing me in front of other passengers, I was happy to pay and already paid extra, but there is a way to treat your customers. This is was such a rude and unpleasant experience.

### "She was absolutely amazing"
Not Verified |  Cairns to Sydney. I would just like to say a big thank you to Helen at Cairns Airport who went above and beyond for us yesterday morning! When we missed our check in time by 8 minutes, we were left standing to the side for 15minites, waiting for the lady to check in another fight before she would assist us. We were absolutely gutted that we had missed our check in, and were unsure what to do next, with no accommodation or car anymore. That was until Helen saw us standing there, with my 9month old baby in my arms and asked if she could help. Within minutes Helen had contacted the staff on the plane and got approval to check us in! She was absolutely amazing and we can not thank her enough. If she didn't come along when she did, I dont know what we would of done.

### "can’t board because you checked in late"
Not Verified |  Perth to Sydney. Got to the airport, desk was closed well over 30min before boarding. Arrived with a few other passengers in line waiting for the desk to open. Cabin bags checked through. Told to move to boarding gate without ticket. Asked a supervisor why I don’t have my ticket so requested a print out so I could wait to board. A line of passengers where ready to board the plane. Supervisor says you can’t board because you checked in late, there checkin is 45min before boarding or strictly you can board afterwards. I said I’m here right now, please check me in. I might be a few min late but I went to drop off my hired car and key but I am here and ready to board. Captain apparently was told about my situation and tigerair refused to board me and my friend. Had to fork out $85, totalling $170 for following two days next flight. First and last time I fly with Tigerair Australia. 0/10 service. Worst customer service and no consideration from any members of the team both on and off site. Other airlines I have travelled with in the last have been excellent. .

### "basically forfeit the ticket"
Not Verified |  Brisbane to Sydney. The worst experience ever. Not to mentions that the flight shown as delayed by 2 hours, when trying to check in they claimed as “ committed delay”. No prior notification no nothing. Had to basically forfeit the ticket and make another booking. Will not ever trust Tigerair again.

### "having my luggage get wet"
Not Verified |  Melbourne to Perth. On my recent flight I did not appreciate walking out on the tarmac in the pouring rain and also having my luggage get wet. We pay enough these days for Tigerair to supply walk on/off tunnels and rain covers for luggage carriers. I don't think these are unreasonable requests.

### "refused onboard for being 9 mins late"
Not Verified |  I had a 10:55am Cairns to Sydney flight, tried to check-in at 10:15am, and refused to be onboard for being 9 mins late. While same flight passengers who has done the online check-in were getting in, the straight response I get was to move the flight to tomorrow for $85. I know it’s my fault for being 9 minutes late. If I could have a just moment of someone helping me out, instead of the effort to move my flight to tomorrow, it would be a lot more appreciated.

### "terrible first impression"
Not Verified | Sydney to Brisbane. So there's a "Move Me" option that allows a passenger if they arrive early or arrive late for their flight to make the necessary changes without a fee but that most certainly wasn't the case with us. So we called the customer service for help and clarification but they couldn't provide any useful information and said the airport has its own policies. I said Ok then surely someone knows like a manager and so when I asked to be connected to the manager, the customer service representative wouldn't connect me and kept saying the same thing over and over. The same answer I'm giving you is the same answer my manager is going to say to you. The first time to Australia, it makes it a terrible first impression!

### "very terrible service"
Not Verified | Melbourne to Coffs Harbour. Had a flight for 10am with Tigerair and they have now rescheduled the flight for 3pm. We contacted Tigerair to get our money back and go with another company so I could arrive at the time they initially said to get to a meeting and they said they cannot put us on another flight or do anything because the flight isn’t canceled and only rescheduled. Terrible airline and would not recommend. They happily take your money but when they make mistakes, they make every excuse possible to not give your money back. I now have a flight that can’t be changed and will now miss my meeting all because of Tigerair and will not be refunded anything. Very, very terrible service.

### "Cancelled my flight from Melbourne"
Delay most of the times. Won’t tell you how much is the expected time of delay. Would just make you wait. Staff would behave as if you are beggars and begging to travel for free. Would take delay and cancellations as their right, and staffs seem ok with all those troubles. Very poor quality staff manners. Never take care about customer comfort and care. Cancelled my flight from Melbourne to Sydney after making me wait for 4 hours, I have another travel schedule tomorrow, and also work, but no one is there to listen. No reimbursement for the extra accommodation and the staff would behave as if you are restarted or they are the boss. Have made up my mind never ever to travel with such an airline. Their cheaper cost attracts us, but they will give you all sorts of troubles which you wish never to get during the travel. Be sensible and wise when you choose an airline before traveling. They can just spoil your life.

### "web check in process failed"
Gold Coast to Sydney. Airline web check in process failed. They gave my seat away and told me as I tried to get on the plane that I couldn’t. 100% their fault. Worst flying experience of my entire life.

### "they just leave people stranded"
Adelaide to Melbourne. Worst Airline. Cancelled flight and left with no alternatives. Had to be at a function and hotel already booked and paid. How can they just leave people stranded. Never booking with them again no matter how cheap their flights are. The rumours were true! Would give them a zero if I could!

### "denied bag check in"
Not Verified |  Gold Coast to Melbourne. My friend and I arrived an hour prior to the flight. We were denied bag check in because it was too late. The customer service lady took extra 5-10 mins by talking and letting it delayed. We ended up flying with another airline.

### "the worst domestic airline"
Perth to Sydney. This is the worst domestic airline I've ever used! They include laptop weight with carry-on luggage to charge more money on check-in. The staff is very rude and they are here only to take your money. Will never fly with them again!

### "Excellent service from Tiger"
Excellent service from Tiger. I was apprehensive flying from Melbourne to Hobart with a 6 month old baby but the Tiger staff made the whole process so easy. We needed to change our flight a week in advance which was completed over the phone with a minimum of fuss. The check in process with the pram went so smoothly with staff attending to us immediately to help us through it. On the flight itself the man sitting next to us was moved to another row so we could have a little extra space (he was moved to an exit row, so win/win), we were given complimentary tea and snack and the flight attendant was very attentive and kept checking in on us. Would definitely fly again!

### "recommend you look elsewhere"
Melbourne to Brisbane. Never fly Tigerair if you want to be treated well as a customer. This airline is here to take your money and leave you dry without any further consideration. We will never give our business to this airline again and we highly recommend you look elsewhere when it comes to flying domestically.

### "I missed my boarding time"
Sydney to Melbourne. Got to airport on time to find a huge queue and only one serving. I was then told that I missed my boarding time and they made me purchase another ticket for the next flight. Never again tigerair.

### "I was so happy with the service"
Sydney to Gold Coast. I was so happy with the service I received by TRigerair from booking process over my phone (very easy) to arrival at my destination.. I did not encounter one problem flight departed on time and arrived ahead of schedule. The ground staff at Sydney were helpful and the cabin crew were fantastic. You always hear bad things about this airline and I know people that avoid flying with them but not me would be more than happy to fly with them again

### "delayed 2 hrs 35 mins"
Melbourne to Brisbane delayed 2 hrs 35 mins. Unfriendly staff, Boarded half the plane when they realised there was a mechanical problem with the plane, a mechanical problem 20 minutes before it was supposed to take off, they worked on the problem for 2 hours which makes it seem I was a bit more serious than a small error. Would never fly again.

### "staff seem to be ill trained"
Melbourne to Adelaide. My wife and I recently flew TigerAir to Melbourne and on the way back home this airline had a staff member with portable scales weigh cabin bags of every single passenger lined up to board the plane. I was 1.4kg over (I had a bottle of water in my bag) and I was ordered to march over to the service desk and pay $36.45 for the extra weight. An expensive exercise for a few extra grams! We were terribly disappointed because we had prepaid for up to 25kg on the one luggage bag we checked in earlier, but it only weighed 19kg at the check in. If provision had been made to us to weigh our carry on bags at the check in, we would have had 6kg extra. Instead, we received a heavy penalty. This is pathetic and TigerAir ought to hang its head in shame for such unnecessary revenue raising tactics, lack of integrity and treating customers with little or no authenticity. If you are that poor, then please raise your prices, improve your level of Customer Service, which is currently extremely lacking to say the least, and needs a transfusuion of some sort. Stop treating people flying in your planes as illegal refugees! Your staff seem to be ill trained. I truly wish I had more positive comments to make - but I’m afraid this Tiger has no teeth. Good luck for the 'future'.

### "We arrived three minutes late"
Brisbane to Darwin. Absolutely horrible. Customer service at the desk was horrendous. We arrived three minutes late for a bag drop & had checked in online hours previously. No signage anywhere saying that the flight had been closed. Every other airline has a drop off time of 30 mins except Tiger. Never ever flying with them again.

### "could not have been more helpful"
❎ Not Verified | Sydney to Melbourne. My 86 year old mother flew Tigerair this week and the airport staff could not have been more helpful assisting her to get through the check-in process, arranging an aisle seat at the front of the plane and then a lift to get on the plane, thus avoiding all the stairs. Thank you, Tigerair.

### "no respect to their customers"
Brisbane to Sydney. I made a booking with Tigerair a week prior for a 7:10am flight to Sydney and a return with jetstar for 2pm as I had an appointment in the morning. The morning of the flight at 6:01am (1hr 9mins before the flight) I receive a call as I'm walking into the airport that the Tigerair flight has been canceled. But don't worry because we booked you another flight at 11:05am with virgin. My appointment was at 10:45am making the whole re-book pointless as I explained to the call center guy who is based in China by the way, but they proceeded to book it and say because we booked you another flight 5 mins before the end of the 4hr after flight time window we don't owe you a refund! 5mins. What about the 69min cancellation heads up? they expect you to check-in 2hrs before the flight! And to be at the gate 45mins before takeoff! So now I'm lost for the day, missed my appointment and out of pocket $205. Pathetic. Garbage airline. No sympathy. And most of all no respect to their customers.

### "stuck in an airport for 5 hours"
Not Verified |  Sydney to Brisbane. The worst airline experience I've had in my life. Inexplicable delays, constant rude and unhelpful service. I will not fly with them again after being stuck in an airport for 5 hours because they decided to cancel my flight on a day when every other airline is flying.

### "Poor customer service"
Not Verified |  Gold Coast to Sydney. Flight boarded an hour late with no announcements until boarding actually started. Poor customer service. Will never fly with this airline again.

### "Worst ever airline experience"
Sydney to Brisbane. Worst ever airline experience. Fight suppose to fly at 9:15 am, says on my ticket to be on airport 90 min in advance. At 7:30 was announced the flight is delayed and new departure is at 12:30. Finally after waiting for more than 3 hrs boarded at 12:15 pm. Wait best part is here: At 12:30 noon pilot announced that we are waiting on a pilot to arrive and will be in 15 mins. It’s 1:10 pm I am still in the plane and waiting for further information

### "delays and lost luggage"
Not Verified |  Sydney to Melbourne. Flight delays and lost luggage were the beginning of my weekend away with Tigerair. No customer service operator to assist and finally a one hour flight has taken 5 1/2 hours of the week end. The return flight home was even worse with 5 cancellations to the flight, an overnight stay at the airport hotel, rude customer service, no compensation or complimentary tokens for the 18 hour delay! A never to be repeated experience! Totally terrible Tigerair!

### "delayed for hours both ways"
Coffs Harbour to Melbourne. Came to Coffs for 2 nights flights, delayed for hours both ways. None of other flights affected but they say it’s due to Sydney weather. Pay the extra money and go with better airline.

### "miss my flight and charged $85 fee"
Melbourne to Sydney. Extremely poor customer service. I don't take too often flight and I don't know than I have to check in before going to the gate so I miss my flight and I've been charged $85 extra fee. The staff was very unpleasant and unhelpful. I will never take again a flight with Tigerair.

### "Absolutely junk!"
Adelaide to Brisbane with Tigerair Australia. Absolutely junk! The flight was delayed 2 hours from the scheduled time. The staff on the ground were absolutely unapproachable. The seats have no knee room at all, attached together. The return flight, on the way to Adelaide I was late by just one minute for checking due to the queues of passengers lined up. By the time I got to one of the rude staff members it was 10 minutes late so I had to pay an extra $85 to get on the next flight.

### "seats are basically square and are very uncomfortable"
Not Verified |  Coolangatta (OOL) to Melbourne (MEL). What can you expect from Tigerair? They are known as the 'cheap' airline of Australia. Normally large families fly on this airline. I managed to get cheap tickets during a sale. I flew Tigerair to Melbourne and Jetstar back. The flight was delayed by more than an hour and the cabin had not been cleaned. There was rubbish from the previous passengers. After waiting in line for half an hour, we finally saw the plane touching down. It taxied around and then mate it to the gate. We started walking across the tarmac and the previous passengers we still getting off. The plane's interior is tight and looks bad. The seats are basically square and are very uncomfortable. The flight was only around 2 hours so it wasn't that bad. On flights, Tigerair does not provide any refreshments or meals. You can purchase them but they are pretty pricey. Tigerair does provide in-flight entertainment for a small amount. You have to download the Tigerair app before boarding the plane. Then you purchase the internet on the plane. Most people don't use the app because of 3 reasons. The internet is expensive, No one knew about the app before boarding and it is a short flight.

### "Absolutely disgusted"
Not Verified |  Coffs Harbour to Sydney. Absolutely disgusted. 5 min late due to a taxi running late. Arrived at 11.05 plane left 11.50am. Still hadn't arrived from Sydney. Had no bags to check and would not let me on as 5 min late. Staff were rude and when contacted support service got told to send email. Never again.

### "I got to airport a bit late"
Brisbane to Melbourne. Horrible experience. Kept showing delay on website so I got to airport a bit late. Don’t want to wait in airport for extra 90 mins for nothing. They did not allow me to check in. Never gonna fly with Tigerair anymore.

### "attendants were cheerful courteous"
Brisbane to Melbourne. After reading the reviews on here I was worried about my flight, but from the moment we arrived at Brisbane Domestic Terminal till we left Terminal 4 at Melbourne we had no problems. The ground staff were very helpful and the flight attendants were cheerful courteous and looked after us. I would not hesitate to book with this airline again!

### "poor customer service"
Melbourne to Adelaide. Incredibly poor customer service at Melbourne Tullamarine at 8:40am on Sunday 7 July. The worst I have ever experienced. I will not use this airline ever again.

### "appalling customer service"
Not Verified |  Sydney to Brisbane. I have been very negatively surprised by the appalling customer service I had on my recent Tigerair flight. Gate agents  decided to charge me a luggage fee "because I was on an exit row" and more importantly were very unprofessional on addressing the issue. When I brought up the issue to customer care, the comment I receive was a clear attempt at covering up an error: "I can confirm on the day it was identified at the boarding gate that you cabin baggage did not meet the size or weight requirements as outlined in our terms and condition. To allow your baggage to travel with you on TT358 you have been charged correctly. The above is  false and a lie.

### "a pathetic airline"
❎ Not Verified | Sydney to Melbourne. What a pathetic airline. Cancelled A flight due to alleged bad weather despite it being clear and sunny from departure to destination. There were clearly other factors at play they chose not to disclose - it's poor treatment to offer an alternative flight an hour earlier on a Friday afternoon knowing full well people cannot make it from work in time. 100% worst airline ever. Never again.

### "an unreliable airline"
Worst service ever! Tigerair's flights are never on time, I had my flight from Sydney to Melbourne and the flight was delayed by 30 min and then it departed 10 min from the already modified departure time. This is an unreliable airline, go with JetStar.

### "over 7kg cabin baggage"
Not Verified |  Brisbane to Melbourne. I will give negative stars if I have any option. Charged $46 for 0.78 over 7kg cabin baggage. Politely asked of just going over but when the only intent is to charge $46 for anything over 7kilos then you cannot argue your point at all.

### "Just plain bad service"
Sydney to Brisbane. Just plain bad service, as other reviewers have mentioned they will cancel flights on you if there's not enough passengers. We were supposed to fly Sydney to Brisbane on flight 358 at 09:15am but at 5:40am we received an email the flight has been cancelled, my wife called their customer service right away to see what our options were, and was told there must have been some issue because the flight is still there. We get to the airport at 07:10am only to be told that the flight was indeed cancelled. The only option was to fly out on Virgin Australia at 12:00pm, now on my daughter's birthday we're spending the time at the airport. We weren't given any options to change the flight either, even though Virgin had flights at 9:45am, 10:00am, and 11:00am but they wouldn't touch our tickets with a ten foot pole saying these are tickets booked on TigerAir and this is the ONLY option available to you, unless you buy a 300 dollar ticket for each of the persons. In conclusion, don't book TigerAir, just spend a bit more money up in advance and book a decent airline like VirginAir, or Qantas, stay away from this shoddy airline.

### "ruined my trip"
Sydney to Melbourne. Rude steward on flight TT 269 SYD to MEL and poor website design. After getting my eboarding pass scanned and while getting into the aircraft, my phone went to sleep mode and the page refreshed, so could not show my seat, the steward said in an aggressive way "you need to find it! opened the link that was sms'd to my phone (which was supposed to be my boarding pass) instead redirected me to bookings where I had to enter my 6 digits booking reference, which I obviously could not remember off the top of my head. all this took place at the aircraft door, very frustrating and ruined my trip. Never again.

### "one of my worst flight"
I flew from Sydney to Perth and 30mins before landing the Captain announced that we couldn’t land in Perth due to weather conditions and that we actually headed back and were about to land in Adelaide ! (I just don’t get why all the other companies were able to land) A 5 hour flight turned into almost 8h, and the next flight is like 16 hours later! They refused to give any compensation ; it was enough for them to just give us another ticket and a night at the hotel but what about all the trip and hotel I booked in Perth ? I just ended up booking another flight with Virgin. Not serious, this company is the biggest joke I’ve ever seen. Plus, the comfort aboard is 0. No space at all, one of my worst flight.

### "frustrated and annoyed"
Cairns to Brisbane. This is really frustrated and annoyed to travel with Tigerair. first time i have been informed my flight has been delayed 8 hrs (due to some technical fault) and landing at Brisbane airport 2.30am ,where I dont have car rental open, no availability of late hours accommodation so I had to changed all my plan,s push one day a head which required extra cost and time just because of flight delayed. Again next consecutive day I got a message from Tigerair, my flight has been delayed again 5 hrs (due to some technical fault). Airline only offered refund price, and when i asked about all the associated cost which relate to this flight delayed then it was mentioned, you can claim this on customer portal site but it is not guarantee.

### "policies and  pricing, could use a rework"
Cairns to Sydney. I have flown in and out of cairns in the last week through tigerair. Both flights I’ve been disappointed in the service. On my way here I offered the woman next to me my window seat. Because of this, the staff came back and forth to us three times asking for our names, our boarding passes, and our ids. They said it was for safety purposes which is fine,  but the demeanor and lack of kindness was over all unsettling. The woman and I laughed it off because we both understood staff was doing their job. However, throughout the entire flight I don’t think I got one smile out of any of the staff. Fast forward to my flight today. I’m not from Australia so my card often gets declined. When I went to pay for my baggage (which if you’ve never flown with this airline they charge 90 dollars extra to check a bag) my card didn’t go through. No big deal, also not the staffs fault. But when I was met with the supervisor she asked me how long I was going to be here and how I planned on supporting myself. Which in my opinion, seems a little personal. All in all I understand customer service, I’ve worked in the customer service industry for a very long time, and your staff, your policies, and your pricing, could use a rework.

### "check-in has already closed"
Sydney to Brisbane. I had flight departing at 6:45am, I reached the airport at 6:15 am so as I tried to check-in one of the staff said the check-in has already closed, which was half an hour prior to the departing time. So they made me get the ticket to next available flight paying $85 extra which was 2 and half hour later. Wsn't a very good experience at all.

### "over the baggage allowance"
Not Verified |  Brisbane to Melbourne. The service was absolutely unacceptable. Individuals travelling in this airlines are made to feel as though they have done something wrong being over the baggage allowance. I was over by 0.86kg and was expected to pay $46 and I had to throw a pair of shoes in the bin. I will never travel with them again.

### "said they closed check in"
Melbourne to Sydney. Could hear them calling for last call for Sydney. I went up to the counter and they said I should check in the kiosk. When I went to the kiosk it said the checkin was closed. Went back to the counter and they said they closed check in. Didn't let me board their last flight and charged me 85 dollars to board the next flight at 6am in the morning. Horrible customer service.

### "the flight was cancelled"
Melbourne to Gold Coast. Our flight supposed to depart on 7:10am and we have received a text from Tigerair around 5:30am advising us the flight was cancelled and we have to move to the next flight. And as normal, the next flight is delayed due to bad weather condition. Why can all other airlines still fly except Tigerair?

### "flight has been delayed"
Not Verified |  Melbourne to Hobart. I should learn time and time again to not fly with this joke of an airline but alas here we are again! Every single time I fly with them about 10x in the last 2 years the flight has been delayed. Never has it ever been on time. My birthday was totally ruined in April a long weekend in Perth ended up being about a day in Perth, lost money on car, hotels everything because they outright cancelled the flight and rebooked another 6 hours later. Compensation? whats that? My flight today is not until 6.30pm tonight and already at 12pm its been delayed so no doubt that will be much later than anticipated. Seriously what is the issue with this airline? the flights are not even that cheap!

### "Staff at Perth airport fantastic"
Not Verified |  I have never left a review unless awful or excellent. Staff at Perth airport were fantastic. My spouse and I were not seated together as we booked through separate platforms. The lovely ground crew at Perth airport tonight gave us seats and after check in closed, paged us to update our tickets so we could sit together. (There were no spare seats until check in close and someone didnt check in). Absolutely lovely, cheerful, nice, informative! 10/10. Now we will wait until Melbourne, fingers crossed for the same though I don't hold my breath (Canberra are notoriously terrible).

### "will never recommend"
Melbourne to Cairns. Pathetic! I paid for seat selection while checking in online. On the site, it appeared the seat had extra legroom but turned to be regular seat. I don’t know what I paid for. Also, they charged $40 extra for my carry on luggage weighing 8kg and not 7kg. The lady at the service desk said my ticket was upgraded. I got no other service as part of the upgrade. I will never recommend it to anyone.

### "Try to avoid TigerAir"
This is the worst airline ever. My flight was at 6:45 am, was told at 6.40 am that the flight has been cancelled and not reason given. The ground staff did not know why it’s cancelled at how the passengers should travel. It was absolute chaos. Later on I checked the same flight 6:45 am from Mel to Sydney was cancelled thrice in a row. At 7.30 am, there was an announcement that they trying to figure out to accomodate passengers to other flights. Try to avoid TigerAir at all cost.

### "they broke my luggage"
I boarded Tigerair from Gold Coast to Melbourne and they broke my luggage and it’s impossible to walk with it. I complained about it to the Airways and they didn’t offer any help nor solution to the situation. Staff was so rude, they said maybe it is my fault to put 21kg in a big size luggage. Really disappointed

### "Will never recommend it"
I was supposed to fly from Brisbane to Melbourne on Tigerair flight TT541 which was supposed to take off at 7:30 PM on 18th Apr. I reached airport at 4:45 PM and completed my security check-in. Around 5 PM I received a message from Tigerair that the flight has been cancelled. Remember this is the second time that they are cancelling my flight(previously cancelled another flight on 22nd Mar, still I didnt learn). I went to the customer helpdesk and they asked me to call customer care. I called the customer care and they gave me 3 options 1) Cancel my onward journey and they will reimburse the amount 2) They can put me on another flight which is supposed to take-off from Gold Coast the next day morning, but I have to find my own means to reach Gold Coast and also find my own accommodation 3) I can fly on other airlines by buying ticket and they will reimburse the amount I paid for the cancelled flight. As this was my much awaited vacation, I had to go for option 3 by paying 400 dollars from my pocket to book a seat in another flight Later I came to know that for some passengers Tigerair allocated seats in other flights. These passengers didnt have to pay anything extra. But some unlucky souls like me had to book seats in other flights and had to pay extra for that. Worst airline ever. Will never recommend it to anyone

### "poor customer service"
Adelaide to Melbourne. Very poor customer service at the Tigerair Australia checkin, although I have checked in online using their confusing online checking system but they did not allowed me boarding as they think my my online chekin was incomplete. And despite the 2 hours flight delay as I was forced to purchase a $400 ticket from other airline. I have always heard about the terrible tiger air customer service, but now I’ve seen it my self.

### "Worst LCC I have ever flown"
Not Verified |  Sydney to Gold Coast. Worst LCC I have ever flown. After manually checking in the family at the bag drop desk due to a sporting equipment (bike) piece of luggage, we confirmed our remaining carry on bags didn't need check in due to weight restrictions. We were then pulled aside at the gate for weighing and charged $108 in 'excess' for 3 of our party due to Easter chocs and lollies which took us over the 7kg allowance. At $36 each I requested we 'pool' the extra into 1 bag and be charged $36 for one of us. After querying the policy in light of what the check-in had advised, the gate attendant was confrontational and said she wouldn't re-weigh the items as we were now last to board and may miss our flight. To me, this amounted to extortion under duress given we either paid whatever she decided or we missed our flight. Will never fly Tiger again. False economy.

### "couldn’t get an aisle seat"
Melbourne to Hobart. The staff at the check in was horrible. Rude & did not give the instructions properly & made me leave the queue twice because of poor instructions. I was waiting for so long & wanted an isle seat. I saw her giving isle seats to others, post losing time, I couldn’t get an aisle seat.

### "trip turned into a nightmare"
Brisbane to Sydney. Flight delayed - at 8am I received a text just 3 hrs before scheduled departure, notifying a delay of 1hr 15mins. Travelled to airport, checked in, through security, went to gate as departure board said "boarding soon". However, the flight was eventually cancelled about 30 minutes before departure, and passengers were changed to a Virgin flight departing 4hrs 35 mins later, a total delay of 6hrs 50 mins. No real info was given on what to do next. Spent one hour wandering the airport trying to get help/information, before finally learning that I would have to collect baggage and check in again for the new flight. I tried to check in again at auto checkin without success, and was then told can't check in until 1hr before flight departure. So I was stranded downstairs with no access to airport wifi, no comfortable seating to wait on, and having not eaten since 6am. I was only visiting Sydney for 3 days, and lost a whole day as I didn't get to my hotel until 8pm. An enjoyable trip turned into a nightmare. And complaints to Tigerair brought a stock response that passengers should claim on their travel insurance (as if travel insurance negates Tiger-air's failures!). What a shambles - no more Tigerair for me.

### "delayed for over 5 hours"
The plane boarded and ready for takeoff when the pilot announced that there was a technical fault that had occurred on the previous flight that he had not been notified about. Everyone had to get off the plane and takeoff was delayed for over 5 hours. This delay made my journey a waste of time.

### "Six hours delay, rude staff"
Brisbane to Sydney. Six hours delay, rude staff, and if you start complaining them they would direct you to book another airlines. Simply don’t bother. No way to fly with Tigerair Australia next time.

### "every time it has been late"
Late leaving as usual. I've flown tiger 6 times and every time it has been late. Given a choice, I use another airline. I only flew with them this time as I had no other option. I understand they're a budget airline, but to be this consistently disorganised is just woeful. So if you fly with them, expect a high chance of being late. Good to know if you have a connecting flight to make.

### "space of seat just enough"
Melbourne to Gold Coast. I checked in quickly by the self check-in counters in Melbourne Airport. The boarding was on time. My Seat was 11B. The space of the seat was just enough. As a low-cost airline, there was no meal and no services on this flight.

### "rude and no empathy"
Brisbane to Melbourne. So you have to be checked in 45 minutes before departure, I woke up at 3am to make sure I was on time. Their was some traffic so my bus was a little late but still within the 45 minutes, I asked the staff women for assistance checking in and they literally looked at me, ignored me and continued talking. By the time they finally assisted me it was past the 45 minute checkin time so they just said oh well you’ve missed it there’s nothing we can do and walked away. I had my 10 month old baby with me too. Not a drop of sympathy or any help with a solution except to pay for new tickets all together. They walked away as I was talking. So rude and no empathy or support what so ever. It’s cheap for a reason.

### "they just don't care"
Melbourne to Canberra. Never, never, never again. They have no concern about a schedule at all. Plane about 90 mins late in takeoff in both directions (Melbourne & Canberra, then the same on the return the very next day!) I was talked into booking with Tiger again this time after we had a flight cancelled the day before on a previous trip with no substitute offered - but now never, never, never again - they just don't care. Cabin and ground staff are all apologetic but of course unable to do anything.

### "Worst airline ever"
Sydney to Melbourne. Worst airline ever! First flight was cancelled without any notification, they were only able to book a flight 3 hours later destroying my onward plans from Melbourne with not so much as a sorry just an 'these things happen' then they charged me 36 dollars for my hand luggage due mainly to my own honesty as I placed both my handbag and cabin bag on the scales - most customers did not weigh half of their bags- only one baggage tag is required per customer, absolute money making scam!

### "A complete shambles"
Not Verified |  Melbourne to Adelaide. Booked onto the 12:50 flight to Adelaide with my husband, arrived to check in to discover the flight was cancelled. The desk staff were appalling, no help whatsoever. We were told no Tigerair flights today (5 April) to Adelaide and to join queue for a refund. We have ended up booking a Virgin Australia flight leaving at 6:30 pm. So a day wasted. We have accommodation and car hire booked from mid afternoon so again have spent time trying to sort out a delayed arrival time. I would never book with this airline again. I know all airlines cancel flights but the attitude of the staff (they were all very young) and really couldn’t care less! We were given a number to ring for compensation by said staff, when I got through I was told to go on line, so they didn’t even get this correct. A complete shambles.

### "Terrible time schedule"
Sydney to Gold Coast on 1st April. Flight delayed 1hr 30 mins. Very disappointing this is my 3 out 4 flights delayed. Terrible time schedule. Very disappointed.

### "About a 10 hour delay"
About a 10 hour delay. 7:10am flight cancelled at 6:15, rebooked for 11:15. Around 9 told its delayed to 12:30. Arrived and checked in luggage and about an hour before departure, told it's been cancelled again and now I'm stuck in the airport until a virgin flight at 4:30. The staff are nice but it's still disgraceful.

### "never fly with them again"
Not Verified |  I have now had roughly 1/5 good trips with Tigerair Australia. 3 times the flight has been severely delayed. Despite having had a troubled past flying with tiger I choose to go with them this time as well. Our flight back to Sydney from Whitsundays got cancelled and the next flight available was not until 2 days later. I had work the next day, and all other flight's with other companies were full. I we had to stay another 2 days in airlie and pay for hotel, transportation ect. had to ask the counter for compensation, if not I would not have gotten any. The lady was very helpful, but I have had too many bad trips with Tigerair Australia, and will never fly with them again.

### "Don’t bother flying Tiger"
Melbourne to Perth. Again, my flight is going to be nearly 2 hours late leaving. Again, unsuspecting people where called to line up to board only to discover that the plane had only just landed and people had to get off it. People have now been standing in queues for 15 mins. Last week they said they’d had a sick crew member (and were nearly two hours late) but not two weeks in a row surely. I foolishly joined the queue last week but not tonight. Nearly everyone on this flight is working age, and they, like me, might be lucky to get 4 hours sleep tonight before we all have to go to work. No food or drink available on board for a month either. I gave it 1/10 because you can’t give zero. Can’t get the FF points to load on 3 flights. Don’t bother flying Tiger.

### "cancelled less than two hours before"
Melbourne to Gold Coast. Flight cancelled less than two hours before departure. No alternative flight possible within 3 days. Refund given but plans severely disrupted and alternative flights with a different airline bought at the last minute lefty’s very much out of pocket.

### "The worst flight ever"
Not Verified |  Sydney to Brisbane with Tigerair Australia. The worst flight ever. First bad thing was the staff and crew, starting from the check in time. The girls standing there didn't have the information to convey to the customers and they were rude. The staff were working as if they neither worried about the customers time nor helped them in any way. The second issue was the incredible high charges they levied on luggage, which is terrible.

### " cancelled on day of departure"
Advised our flight was cancelled on the day of departure. No alternative offered with another carrier or another route As we had ongoing travel arrangements, we were forced to spend upwards of $3000 on last minute tickets with another carrier. Tigerair admitted no liability and no compensation. We had comprehensive travel insurance however were unable to claim as Tigerair cited "Operational requirements" as their reason for cancellation and refused to elaborate further, which was not accepted by the insurance company. After sending them several emails asking them for the exact reason for cancellation and also to comment on why we were not offered seats on another flight, we eventually received a curt email stating that they were unable to comment and we were effectively dismissed. It is clear after reading review after review of customers that have had their plans severely disrupted by this carrier that they do not have any focus on their customer and will withdraw their services to suit themselves.

### "the flight was cancelled"
Melbourne to Perth. We had a flight from Melbourne to Perth on the 17th of February. My wife, my two years old son and arrived to the airport in the evening, checked in our luggage and right away at the moment of heading to the security check, we heard that the flight was cancelled. Simple as that. This cancellation cost us almost AUD1000. Our hotel, car rental, transfers to airport were all gone or cancelled with heavy fines besides the next available flight we could afford was double the price we had booked with Tigerair let aside the expenses of additional nights we had to spend in Melbourne. Of course we are not the only ones and I am sure there were more poeple affected with the same issue, but my most sympathy goes to all those people like us who come from the other side of the world. Our plan to spend a week in Perth was ruined and reduced to 3 days. All these problems happened due to a simple cancellation and all we get is a refund and apology. I have contacted my insurance and they won't help since they consider the airline to be liable and tigerair won't help us as they consider cancellation to have been beyond they control which is nonsense.it's all about money. It's always okay for simple passengers to lose hard-earned money and Tigerair won't care. (everyone on the sae flight will agree with my post as I talked to bunch of them at the Airport). Since I am not getting my money back, I warn everyone with using Tigerair. The chances your flight would get cancelled with this is more than any other airline in Australia.

### "stood in the line for an hour"
Not Verified |  Sydney to Melbourne. Tigerair cancelled multiple early morning flights with short notice on a Monday morning . There was one staff on the floor who continued to avoid everyone perhaps because he had no idea himself. There was a long line of passengers waiting and it took Tigerair management very long to figure that they need to open extra counters so people could get their flights sorted. Flights do get cancelled however passengers should be afforded the courtesy of quick information without unnecessary delays. We stood in the line for an hour before we could sort out our refund.

### "Ridiculous fees for overages"
Sydney to Cairns. This is the worst airline I have ever flown. Horrible staff. Ridiculous fees for overages and flight was delayed. The seats are extremely uncomfortable. Boarding was an absolute nightmare, they just yelled at us. They wanted to charge me $274 just to check my suitcase in.

### "Shocking experience!"
Melbourne to Sydney. Shocking experience! Our 8.40 a.m. flight was cancelled just 2 hours in advance and we were given a new flight the next day. We could not accept this as we needed to be in Sydney that specific day. Reading other reviews this is no exception. (Should have read those before booking.) Customer support (who seem to be all non-native English speakers and very hard to understand) not helpful at all. Avoid choosing Tigerair at any cost! Other domestic airlines are similarly priced and more reliable.

### "cancelled or delayed"
Not Verified |  My 8am flight from Melbourne to Sydney was cancelled due to ‘operational issues’ putting me on the next flight with a different airline at 12pm as the earliest option 4 hours later.. On my return home my 7am flight from Sydney to Melbourne was delayed 1.5 hours only notified when arrived at the airport with no option to transfer to a flight around the same time. Don’t fly this airline if you have plans as you are guaranteed to be cancelled or delayed. Very poor customer service dismissing all queries and not providing any options or refunds.

### "Canceled my flight"
Sydney to Brisbane. Canceled my flight when I was on route to the airport. Wouldn't even consider cover the cost of my expenses I incurred because of their failure. At the end of the day my trip was canceled and I wAs out over $200.

### "never had a worse experience"
Melbourne to Sydney. Tigerair are only interested in making money from customers, and have no interest in customer service. They cancel flights, not attend their service desk, and then charge customer fro not checkin in for flights they canceled. I was checked in on the 7:50am flight from Melbourne to Sydney. On my way to the airport I discovered the flight cancellation message from tigerair and was moved to the 9:35 flight, so I rang and discussed my options with tigerair service. I confirmed that I wanted to be on the 9:35 flight. The lady on the phone confirmed me being on the flight and said nothing to me about having to re check-in. I was at the airport before 7am, and around 7:30 I went to the tigerair desk near the gates to confirm my allocated seat, however, no staff were there at all. I went to the generic airline service desk at terminal 4 and only Jetstar staff were there. A few minutes before 9am, tigerair staff finally showed up. When I asked to confirm my seat they said they can’t allow me on the flight as I haven’t checked in. When I asked them to check me in, they said it is not possible, as this needs to be 45 minutes before the flight, and that other airlines have 30 min guidelines theirs is 45 minutes! I explained that I have been waiting for more than half hour for staff here and no one was there, I was told not the only way to get a flight on the day was that I get back outside to the terminal to the tigerair check in area and pay $85 to get on the 11:05 flight. The flight at 11 was also delayed and I arrived 5 hours later. That very same week, my return flight was also canceled with tiger, and had to find another flight and ended up paying nearly $400 one-way ticket. Tigerair policy is simply focused on taking advantage of customers. What is extraordinary is the response from staff, having explained to the manager and trying and reason with her and get her to think from the customer perspective, having done everything I was meant to do checking in 23 hours before the flight and that the changes were not mine in the first place. Also being in the airport since 7 there is no reason for me not to intentionally check-in, also verifying that they can see the phone call I made this morning on record, agreeing to be on the 9:35 flight. The manager showed indifference to my experience as a customer, and even worse, having lodged a complaint to the complaints department they offered a single response backing their earlier response and stopped responding to my email and complaint, not even offering an apology. I honestly have never had a worse experience. Never again!

### "wont be flying Tigerair again"
Melbourne to Sydney. A family trip to Sydney on the weekend took a turn for the worse when our flight to Sydney on Friday evening was cancelled 3 hours before hand due to operational requirements. We received a text message with our new flight details on the first flight on Saturday. A bit annoyed but seeing there was a huge storm in Sydney that night not their fault, and I was actually impressed with with how quick and efficient they were in notifying us and rebooking our flight. However it all went to custard the next morning. We got up early to catch the 6.45am flight. On route to the airport we checked the flight status at Melbourne Airport and it was listed as cancelled. We rang Tiger Air who confirmed that the flight was still running. Seeing that we didnt received a txt or email from Tiger we assumed all was good. When we got to the airport however the flight was indeed cancelled and the customer service people were absolutely hopeless. We ran to the Qantas service desk where the most lovely and helpful staff managed to get us the last 3 seats on a 8.00am flight. It was expensive as you would imagine. The only positive thing was that the refund process was quick and simple I dont expect a first class experience from a budget airline, however because they dont have a big fleet of aircraft when incidents like this happen they cannot recover quickly enough. I wont be flying TigerAir again

### "conduct today is inexcusable"
Not Verified |  Sydney to Melbourne. I received this message from Tiger at 6:53 this morning (less than 10 minutes before I was meant to leave for the airport): "Your flight TT221 SYD-MEL 09/02/19, departure time 8:45, has been cancelled due to operational requirements. New flight TT287 10/02/19, with a revised departure time of 21:45. My flight had been delayed for 37 hrs. My weekend trip to Melbourne was now going to start at 9:45pm on Sunday. I called customer support, thinking, "surely this is a mistake". Over an hour later someone finally picks up the phone. There's been no mistake. So it looks like I'm just not going to Melbourne after all. So now I ask about compensation, assuming Tiger will refund me for the return trip and hoping they'll also cover my accommodation. Never assume with Tiger. Apparently, they can refund me for the flight they cancelled (if I send an email to accounts) but, because I booked through Expedia, they can only give me a store credit for the return flight. And there's no guarantee I'll get anything back for accommodation. I can say with confidence that if Tiger does not refund both my flights and accommodation I will never fly with them again. It is not worth saving a few bucks on flights if you end up with no flight at all. I have now spent hundreds of dollars on absolutely nothing. And this isn't even the first time this has happened to me. The only other time I've flown Tiger was to Perth in 2017. That time they cancelled my returning flight, and put me on the same flight a day later. That was inconvenient but redeemable because they gave us a month's notice, put us on the next Tiger flight and at least it meant my holiday was longer (not non-existent). Tiger's conduct today is inexcusable. My weekend, which was meant to be spent celebrating my birthday, has been ruined, and for the privilege I am out of pocket.

### "positively surprised"
Brisbane to Canberra. This is the first time I flew with Tigerair Australia. I was positively surprised by the service starting from the check-in (including the service of the personal at Brisbane airport baggage counter) and flight attendances of the (short) flight. There was a delay departing (about 45 min) but all the staff were (genuinely) friendly. Although Tigerair is a budget airline the overall experience I had was very positive. I couldn't expect anything more for the price I paid for the ticket. I will definitely fly with Tigerair again.

### "worst airline experience"
Perth to Melbourne. At 62 years of age my experience with Tigerair was the worst airline experience ever. The flight was cancelled on the same day I was flying. I had paid for my accommodation and a training course at my destination but apparently that was just bad luck... sorry for the inconvenience in spite of explains it had taken me a while to save the necessary money. I was told there were no more available flights to book me on for a couple of days in spite of advertised flights online with available seats. Oh and in spite of advising I did not have the money to book another airline, they further advised it would take 10 days to get my money back. I believe their partners as in this case was Gotogate overbook and then cancel those who paid the least, as I didn't take any of the many promoted add ons. I highly recommend paying extra with a decent and reputable airline over a cheaper airline that pushes add ons and then dumps you from the flight. I will not get back my paid accommodation or course money.

### "Lift your game Tiger"
Cairns to Sydney. Will never ever consider booking with Tigerair again. Flight cancelled on the morning of departure. Was warned how bad they were so took out insurance but that doesn't help when you need to be somewhere. Lift your game Tiger/Virgin. No help to get new flights. You have been warned.

### "never fly with them again"
Adelaide to Melbourne. Worst airline in the world. I booked return flight with them from Adelaide to Melbourne. On 17/01/19 my flight from Adelaide to Melbourne was delayed by an hour which made me angry but it was still manageable. I supposed to fly back on Sunday (20/01/19) but Saturday (19/01/19) about 5pm I got msg from them that my flight has been canceled. I called them to get some other flight but they said there is no flight available before Monday. It was very important for me to come back on Sunday so at the last moment, I had to buy another ticket from the Virgin with double the price. I was very pissed off with their service. It is the shortest airline I have ever flown with. I’ll never fly with them again.

### " no more seats for 4 days"
Melbourne to Perth. I am totally aghast at having our flight to Perth cancelled and being told there are no more seats available for a another 4 days. We were planning our short holiday to Perth and had prepaid accomodation and car hire as well as entertainment for Australia Day. The operator didn’t care and was uninterested in helping us with an alternative. It may well have been cancelled due to the strike they were planning the following day. I will never flyTiger again. It may be marginally cheaper but you get treated like dirt. How can a service company think this is acceptable.

### "cancelled few hours before"
Melbourne to Perth. Flight cancelled few hours before departure. After everything was planned, I was informed that my flight was cancelled due to operational requirements 6 hours before departure. Never going to buy from them again.

### "Flight cancelled night before"
Not Verified |  Brisbane to Sydney. First time booking with this airline and will be the last. Flight cancelled night before due to mechanical failure but after I booked the ticket originally I was receiving emails saying pilots may go on strike, surprise surprise thats what I believe happened not mechanical issues. Couldn't contact airline as they closed at 5pm. I Booked a early flight to get to Sydney as I had to drive straight back to Brisbane that day (work related), they put me on another airline 5 hours later and I drove 11 hours straight to get home at 3am in morning and drop the car off as I promised I would. I will be doing this on a regular basis but there is no way in the world I will book this airline again, the amount of negativity I have had since from people about this airline backs up my reasons. Even on the Virgin flight they put me on my fellow passengers told me never to fly Tiger and to pay extra for another airline.

### "Terrible, terrible, terrible"
Melbourne to Adelaide. Fly interstate one way only a 2 hour delay. Then return flight next day (Sunday) is cancelled. No option to move to another flight same day. Terrible. If they cancelled a whole flight surely they bring in a replacement plane to substitute the flight. Instead next available flight Monday 3pm. Stuff that you have to work or something like that during the week. No guarantee of hotel costs being refunded upon application. So spend with no guarantee. Also if you choose to take a flight with someone else. You have to not only pay for that but wait up to 2 weeks for your refund. Terrible, terrible, terrible.

### "over the 7kg carry-on allowance"
I was stung for being over the 7kg carry-on baggage allowance. While waiting to board the Brisbane to Melbourne flight I was called me out of the line and asked to place my 2 bags on the scales. One of the bags was a laptop and I thought laptops are excluded from the carry on baggage allowance as I've traveled with other airlines, including other budget carriers and they made an exemption for laptops. I was then asked to pay on on-the-spot fee of $48. Also, the ground staff person was very rude and arrogant and showed zero sympathy for my situation. His only concern was in how I was going to pay. I'm not impressed. I won't be traveling with TigerAir again.

### "Never flying Tigerair again"
Sydney to Adelaide. Never flying with Tigerair again. By far the worst company I’ve ever flown with. Found out our flight was delayed 2 and a half hours only 1 hour before our flight took off. Everyone on that flight would have been at the airport by then. Also got delayed by 3 hours on the way to Sydney. I would advise people to never ever fly with Tigerair.

### "Appalling service"
Sydney to Brisbane. Absolutely the worst airline I have ever dealt with. My flight was cancelled with notifications coming 2hrs after the flight departure time. I need to catch a train for 3hrs before arriving at the airport. No explanation given at the time with customer services stating this is why you should have travel insurance. 100’s of people were left stranded. Appalling service. I’ve been all of the world on budget airlines and this has never happened.

### "ruined 3 days of my holiday"
Melbourne to Brisbane. Tigerair ruined 3 days of my holiday and i had to inconvenience friends and family who picked me up and dropped me and provided accommodations so I am waiting for reimbursement. The service was pathetic and it is easy to see that everything done was to save money. I will take this further if I am not reimbursed for my inconvenience as well as lost time accommodation and transport costs.

### "They are an absolute joke"
Perth to Melbourne. They are an absolute joke! I booked ticket with this company, on morning of the actual departure they sent me a txt saying it’s been cancelled. Called customer service waited 40 mins to get to talk with anyone, who cared the less. Advised me they have no recovery flight only 3 days later that’s been cancelled an hour later then another 5 days later. While they advertised the cancelled flight for sale on different website. They said they won’t refund the return ticket, because that flight hasn’t been affected, which is because if I won’t leave I can’t return. To annoy me some more they keep sending me confirmation email about the return flight. Not to mention I have wrote them numerous complaints no response. If they ever want to refund the money for a flight they would do in 3 weeks, which I doubt! but they could take money straight away. They take no responsibility for any other financial loss that caused by their action!

### "pretty good value on this flight"
Melbourne to Hobart. We got pretty good value on this flight with Tigerair. Boarding was efficient, the crew was friendly, the flight operated on time and our exit row seats were comfortable. Prior to the flight, the airline had done a good job at keeping us informed about a possible pilot go-slow that might have caused us problems. We had to wait a long time for our baggage at Hobart, but this is almost certainly an airport problem (it was very busy on the weekend before Christmas). Going by our experience on this flight, I would be game to try Tiger again.

### "never consider flying them again"
Sydney to Melbourne. We were informed of a delay on our original flight time but upon arriving at the airport we were informed that the flight had been cancelled with no more flights available for the next few days. We were offered a refund and have received no money, nor information after several attempts to contact Tigerair. We had a flight to catch back to the UK the day after so had to drive from Sydney to Melbourne, putting us out of over £400. Tigerair have been very poor with communication and overall customer service. Would never consider flying with them again.

### "No attempt of help from Tiger"
Not Verified |  Cairns to Melbourne. Having flown Tiger before i did not expect this airline to burn clients as they clearly do. Upon arrival at the airport, advised of 1 hour delay. After 1 hour advised of 3 hour delay. after 5 hours advised of cancellation. No attempt of help from Tiger, everyone had to sort out alternative flights or accommodation airport transfers etc for the following days flight. Our cost so far $428. It gets better the next day my wife and I are charged $46 for one of us exceeding the 7kg carry on limit by 2 kg. This airline should not be licenced to operate in this country.

### "disappointed and frustrated"
Not Verified |  Completely disappointed and frustrated! Would not recommend to anyone, they delayed our flight about 10 minutes after we were supposed to have already been boarded and supplied no reasoning as to why. They then gave a new estimated time for boarding and also delayed that time after they had us line up for a plane that had only just landed filled with people from its previous flight, we waited in line for 30 mins before being told our flight was then delayed again due to "engineering problems"! Outraged is all I can say the staff at the gates were also extremely rude about how much longer it would take before we could board. Appaling company and staff, will never use Tigerair Australia again and I recommend that you dont either!

### "Never use this company"
Sydney to Gold Coast, we were 45 mins before at airport but they did not get us to go to flight, and on the way back to Sydney canceled due to engineering requirements. I did not receive the any email, call or text by Tigerair. The worst flight I ever booked. I was forced to book other airlines flights on the same day with extra money from my pocket I would never book Tigerair Australia again. Please don't let them this kind of company give your money back. I am really upset and unfortunately I had to pay extra money to go to my city. Never use this company.

### "worst flight I ever booked"
My flight from Brisbane to Melbourne and on the way back from Melbourne to Brisbane were both canceled due to safe excuse named as "engineering fault" by Tigerair. The worst flight I ever booked. I was forced to book other airlines flights on the same day with extra money from my pocket worth AUS 500. I would never ever book Tigerair Australia again.

### "not be flying then ever again"
Not Verified |  Sydney to Melbourne. Absolutely appalled by Tigerair! Have had our flights changed & cancelled 6 times in 10 days. Wouldn’t even offer an earlier flight and could not check to see if there were any. Tried to push me into getting a refund & then got angry because I refused. Will not be flying then ever again!

### "check-in is closed."
Brisbane to Sydney. Reached airport and could not locate their departure until 40 minutes before departure, and the self check-in is closed. asked the lady and she said I can’t board this flight because check-in is closed. I paid extra to get a flight for 8 hours later. I learnt my lesson, don’t wait for it to happen to you.

### "appalled with Tigerair"
Not Verified |  Sydney to Perth. I am absolutely appalled with Tigerair! I would not recommend them at all, first of all they canceled my flight 10 mins before we were due to board. Then don’t even offer a “recovery” flight. I had to pay for a hotel in Sydney as I’m not from the area, and was told by Tigerair staff at the airport I would be reimbursed for! They are now refusing to refund the cost of hotel because I didn’t take there “recovery” flight! What recovery flight? Yous didn’t offer one! I’m beyond frustrated as I am now $950 out of pocket after getting a hotel room and have to buy a new flight. If I could give 0/10 I would. So disgusted.

### "flight would be delayed"
Melbourne to Brisbane. Got sent a message that flight would be delayed and will depart at 8:40 (original dep time 7:05). Got to the airport and departure time was 9:10. Asked staff has it been delayed and they said no. Currently 9.25 and have not departed. Ridiculous.

### "purchase the travel insurance"
Not Verified |  Whitsunday Coast to Sydney. While on a business trip to Sydney we decided to purchase the travel insurance offered by Tiger air on there booking website. On our return journey the plane had an engineering problem which made us return to Sydney. We were then told the next flight available to get home was in 48 hrs. Tigerair offered us 1 night's accommodation and a place on the flight in 48 hrs at no charge. I was not concerned as we had taken out the Tigerair insurance to cover the short fall of staying in Sydney (transport,accommodation, meals). Upon returning home I lodged my insurance claim which was very straight forward and we had kept the expenses to a minimum so I was confident that that claim would not be a problem, however it would now appear that having a travel delay with Tigerair, the very airline that we were insured with is not covered. This is the response from Chubb Insurance Australia. Our decision After careful review of the information provided to us, we regret to advise that your policy is unable to respond to this claim as the cancellation of your flight was due to Tigerair engineering requirements. As outlined above, any loss caused by a transport provider delay, cancellation or rescheduling is unfortunately excluded from cover. In addition, we note that you accepted the recovery flight offered by Tigerair deeming your airfares as used. Please be advised Section 1 can only provide cover for the unused portion of a Tigerair ticket or the costs of re-scheduling a Tigerair ticket. Should you have additional documentation that may alter our decision, please feel free to forward it to us at your earliest convenience. Although this may not be the outcome that you had hoped for, we trust that the above explanation has given you a better understanding of your policy coverage. If you are unsatisfied with our claim assessment or the service that you have received, please refer to the attached brochure which outlines Chubb Insurance’s complaint handling process. Please feel free to contact us at the above address or by phone if you have further queries regarding this matter, noting your claim number as a reference.

### "disgusted over the situation"
Melbourne to Gold Coast. Arrived at airport 2 hours prior. Checked in at the self-checkin machine and responded “issue with seat allocation, please see reception”. So we waited in the long queue assuming everyone had same issue. Checked my email itinerary and says 1 hour 20 minutes delay while I was waiting. Soon as we to speak to service desk, they told us the flight is all booked out and request to pay another $87 for the next flight available 4hrs later. We were disgusted over the situation after 20 minutes arguing. So we went to another representative and explained the situation. She was able to give us the next flight free of charge with no hesitation. They are lucky to get 1 star for service just because we got the next flight free of charge.

### "just asked for a refund"
Received a text stating flight cancelled and "call 1800... For any enquiries". This happened just under 3 hours prior to boarding. Proceeded to call the hotline provided which took another 40 mins to get through! The phone call was not very helpful as they said the next flight available was 2 days later (later they managed to find an alternative flight for 1 day later, but still). No further help or support offered other than the take it or leave it alternate flight offer (which is at least 1 day later). We eventually just asked for a refund.

### "would never recommend them"
Brisbane to Cairns. Won’t ever buy a ticket from this airline again. They nickel and dime everything and charge you for any baggage over 7 kg. They also don’t tell you about their baggage fees and when you get to the airport to check your bag they charge you 3 times as much to check your bags. Most frustrating flying experience ever. I would never recommend them to anyone.

### "No more Tigerair for me"
Not Verified |  Taking my first and last flight on Tigerair today. This is a nickel and dime to death airline. The baggage machine reader wasn’t working correctly, so had to wait for the two available people to work through several customers to get my bag checked. Got to the gate and found my carryon was 2kgs too heavy - there were two people standing by to process the additional payments from many passengers. Clearly this is nothing more than a money maker for them. Not an issue of aircraft weight since you can pay the extra $40 (for 2kgs!) and walk on board, and if the extra weight had been in my checked bag, they would have never known. But because you’re at the gate, you have no choice but to pay. I accept their policies are posted on the website, but the restrictions are tight, and the charges ridiculous. No more Tigerair for me - arbritary weight restrictions and a hassle.

### "Tigerair is a disgrace"
Melbourne to Sydney. Expensive cab ride to airport, long line security, waiting for gate announcement when a text arrives saying flight cancelled! No reasons. No other flights. No word of assistance or help. We ended up renting a car and driving all night 9 hours door to door. Tigerair is a disgrace and anyone thinking of flying with them should make another plan

### "cancel flight 30mins before boarding"
Sydney to Melbourne. Tigerair is an absolute joke, I would rather walk, drive, catch a boat or use whatever other forms of transport is available. To cancel a flight 30mins before boarding and then having to wait 3+ weeks after the cancelled flight to have the refund "approved" which just means a form is sent out to be completed and will have to wait another 3+ weeks for the refund to be actually processed. 2 Months wait for a refund?! Spend the extra and fly with an actual airline that cares about their customer service, and one that actually will get you to your destination without incident

### "never fly this airline again"
Melbourne to Sydney. Tigerair decided to cancelled my flight 2 hours before the flight at that point I was already at the airport. They did not call me or message me, instead they informed me via email which I don't check often. They did not provide a solution for the cancelled flight, I was stuck at airport for the whole day and had to paid 300$ extra for a new flight with a different airline. Neither the loss in travel time nor the extra cost were compensated by Tigerair. Have requested for a refund from Tigerair, they told me it would take 10 business days to process it, it's now 20 business days and still waiting for the refund. Can this airline get any worse. You get what you paid for, choose this dodgy airline at your own risk. My friends and I will never fly with this airline again.

### "a very poor experience"
Melbourne to Sydney. Both flights late. Outward one by 2 hours due to engine issues. Rude humorless staff who make it very clear they don't care, and would much rather talk to each other than engage positively with customers who they clearly find irritating. They might be cheaper, but the wasted time sitting around, and the attitude, makes for a very poor experience.

### "worst airline experience"
Melbourne to Brisbane. Our experience this weekend with tiger was the worst airline experience I have ever had. Our flight on Saturday morning was expected to leave at 9:35am, but it was delayed until 1:55pm. The main issue I have is the lack of communication and compensation for time lost. There was no communication as to what time our flight was being changed to until 11:30. We were simply sitting around for two hours without hearing anything from the staff. When they finally told us our flight would now leave at 1:55, they offered us a $5 meal voucher. Now I'm not sure if they have looked at the food prices at Melbourne airport lately, but $5 doesn't buy you much! For a 4.5 hour delay I would expect more like $10-$15. On our flight back home on Sunday night from Brisbane to Melbourne, another bad experience. Once again a flight delay, this time our originally scheduled 9:15 pm flight home was going to leave at 11:15pm, and there was absolutely zero communication from the staff. No announcenent, nothing. We found out on Google that out flight was delayed. Due to this delay our long term car park we had booked in Melbourne charged us extra because we overstayed our visit, and we only overstayed our visit because of Tiger. Never again flying with Tigerair.

### "ignore me and my e-mails"
Brisbane to Cairns. My wallet fell out of my pocket when I was getting up from my seat on my flight on July 12th. I noticed while I was coming down the steps onto the tarmac, I was not allowed to go back and check my seat. The crew on the tarmac told me to go to the gate and another crew member would bring my wallet down to me. I was one of the very last off the plane. The crew started boarding the plane almost immediately after we came through the gate. We then had to wait an hour with no communication as to whether or not they had looked for it or if it had been found. The crew couldn't even care enough to actually look at my seat for it and didn't ask for a description. When I called the airline the following day I was told I had to e-mail "customer care" to check for lost property. Crew didn't let me know they had found my wallet until the following day, after I had cancelled all my cards and paid to replace my drivers licence. I thought a customer service line would respond right away if they had found something so important. They told me if I wanted to get my wallet back that I had to pay for them to post it back to me. I paid for and sent them an envelope almost two weeks ago and they have not returned my wallet to me. I have been in contact with Tigerair in regards to this, and they repeatedly ignore me and my e-mails. The customer service with this airline is abysmal. Tthe customer care e-mail have been absolutely no help whatsoever.

### "service you get is close to none"
Flew Sydney to Melbourne with Tigerair Australia. Seriously, if you can, avoid this airline. It's the cheapest you can find. The service you get is close to none and they will make you pay for even breathing. The flight was delayed and instead of getting an apology, the extremely rude staff made me pay 36 AUD because my carry on was 1.5 k more than their 7k limit, and insisted she had to count my laptop bag as well. I could see that others were getting away with much heavier bags but she was just making a fuss out of nothing for my bag (I don't have an Aussie accent so she gave me a completely different attitude).

### "never choose Tigerair again"
Not Verified |  Flew to Brisbane with Jetstar in the morning and was flying back to Sydney that night with Tiger Airways. It was the first time I was to fly with Tiger and they cancelled the flight via text and email. I immediately called customer service which is based in the Philippines and waited 15 minutes for someone to answer the phone. After 20 minutes on a mobile phone I realised that I would not be provided with any assistance. I went to the airport and waited two and a half hours for Tiger Airways staff to get to work at 6.30pm. To say Tiger Airways staff are unhelpful is a gross understatement. They could not give a rats about the customer at all, in fact their complete lack of ability to provide assistance was incredulous. Their idea of assistance was for me to sleep at the airport in the clothes I was wearing, go without food or showering and my prescription medication for the next two days. The fact that they are required to put passengers on the next available flight doesn't hold for them if there are no seats available. I was asked haughtily if I had read their terms and conditions. Now I have to wait two weeks to get my money back and they refused to give me a receipt. Disgraceful airline, rude staff with no empathy or common sense and appalling service. Tiger Airlines business practices need to be investigated. To make matters worse all the other airlines jacked up their prices to take cancelled passengers on board. I slept at the airport and had to pay $552 to fly one way to Sydney the next morning. Just a horrible stressful experience and I will never choose Tigerair again.

### "experience was disappointing"
I love Tiger Airways and find their flight crew incredibly friendly and efficient. However today my experience was disappointing because of three young people in row 1 AB&C who were served alcohol again after the cabin service had ceased and the pilot had asked the crew to prepare the aircraft for landing. The individuals concerned were loud, swearing and jumping around in the their seats continually reclining the seat and generally being quite obnoxious. The crew seemed to think their behaviour was OK and a great start to their holiday. It spoilt my flight and that of the person sitting next to me. I don't believe alcohol is necessary at 9.30am I'm not adverse to a drink on a flight but this was not necessary. Overall think Tiger great value but will rethink my next flights.

### "flight was cancelled"
Today my group of 23 people booked a trip with Tigerair TT229 Sydney to Melbourne, the flight was cancelled. Staff Tigerair at the airport did not take care of the customers. Lack of responsibility, and would not help us book other flight. Please do not fly with Tigerair.

### "people making outrageous complaints"
Sydney to Gold Coast. Poor staff had to put up with terrible abuse pre boarding at gate re customers luggage being over 7kg. Staff continued to be supportive and patient with people making outrageous complaints due to their carry on baggage being over 7kg. Congrats girls for what was an obvious abuse of you

### "Dreadful, never again"
Sydney to Brisbane. I don't know why I keep flying this terrible airline. This is the second time they have cancelled a flight on me. I was book to travel on 3 July from Sydney to Brisbane. I was in Canberra and had to drive to sydney to catch my flight. I received a text from the airline to say that my flight was cancelled due to technical problems with the aircraft. The call centre told me that i had two options, a flight to Sydney on the 5th, or a flight to the Gold Coast on the day. Picked the latter because i did not want to pay accomodation charges in Australia's most expensive city. I mentioned to a member of Tigerair staff at the kiosk at Sydney airport that I had been bumped off the flight. Her reply "why do you keep flying on this airline". Hardly filled me with confidence. It took me two hours by public transport to get to Brisbane Domestic airport to pick up my car. Dreadful, never again.

### "completely dissatisfied"
Not Verified | We were booked to travel on the 30 June to Brisbane from Melbourne going for our nephews wedding in the afternoon. We booked our tickets on the 20th May. Our flight was at 7am. We were travelling on the 30th June and returning the next day 1st July. We booked parking at the airport and arrived around 5.30am for the flight. The airline has cancelled he flight. They had sent an email about 12.30am saying the flight was cancelled. The airport agents were rude and unprofessional and said to book another flight ourselves. This is completely unacceptable and many people like us were stranded. This airline has got no customer service or sympathy to its passengers. We are completely dissatisfied as we missed a family wedding and ruined our weekend with family and friends.

### "The flight was canceled"
Perth to Melbourne. Horrible my child's first flights delayed twice at 1am in the morning, then canceled until later in the afternoon. Left heaps of people with having to sort out accommodation cost for a few hours and travel cost back home and also the cost of parking for waiting for so long. They did promise to reimburse some accommodation only if you live out of metro area. You pay first then they pay you back after 7 days min. The flight was canceled and the sign below says it all. Pay the extra cash people to get a better air company who will look after you.

### "Never flying here again"
Not Verified |  The flight was cancelled from Sydney to Brisbane and we went to the airport to get more information. The front desk staff was rude and not trained properly to handle customers in a stressful situation. She merely said today's flight (Sunday) has been cancelled and next flight is on Tuesday. As an airline staff member there should be a bit more compassion from the staff towards customers even if it's a budget airline. Customer service is horrible. Never flying here again. Cheap flights means cheap service and use of cheap attitude and language by staff.

### "dispensed with good customer service"
A regular flyer with Tigerair on the Sydney-Adelaide route, I presented myself at the automatic boarding pass machine at the departure terminal at Kingsford-Smith Airport domestic terminal at 08.01 am for a scheduled 08.45 am departure on Tuesday 12th June 2018. I had no baggage to check-in and normally would have downloaded a boarding pass prior to arriving at the airport so as to avoid contact with this airline's arrogant and rude ground staff. The automatic boarding machine told me that check-in was closed, so I spoke to the female at the start of the Tigerair check-in race who told me that check-in was closed and that I could not fly that day but could get onto a flight on Wednesday for an additional fee of $85. Given that I had no check-in baggage and would normally not even present myself at this counter, I stood my ground and was eventually given a boarding pass. I dashed to Gate 57 to find that the lounge was still full of customers and believe it or not, the aircraft to service the flight had not yet arrived at the gate. The aircraft arrived at 08.15 am and the arriving passengers commenced disembarkation at 08.22 am. Boarding for my flight commenced at 08.32 am. I believe that an unethical method is being used by Tigerair to scam timid customers into paying an additional fee under such circumstances when in the 'olden days' good customer service would have seen a boarding pass issued given that there was no reason not to do so on the part of the airline. Tigerair is a low cost airline, which according to its latest propaganda on page 5 of it's 'tigertales' magazine provides 'value, choice and innovation'. But in the scramble to make money it has dispensed with good customer service and employs arrogant and rude ground staff to intimidate customers. Sometimes it is better to pay a bit more to fly on a competitor, but always stand up for your rights as a paying customer!

### "nothing positive to say"
Sydney to Melbourne. I think there is nothing positive to say about this airline (only cheap flights that can be much more expensive than you think). Cancelled flight 2 hours before departure! Next flight offered two days later (it was supposed to be weekend away). No effort made to even try to check with other airlines to book another flight. Paid airport car park from Friday night and paid that day for nothing (flight cancelled by them not by me but no refund offered) and next day I booked flight through Virgin Australia that had cost me extra $200. If anyone who is reading this post and wants to have without hassles and stress don't choose Tugerair. They are useless and unfriendly with no compassion and no effort to help their customers.

### "terrible customer service"
Sydney to Perth. We were basically dumped at Melbourne airport after our flight was redirected due to poor weather in Perth, with only 2 choices either take a flight back to Sydney and find our own way to Perth or take a refund and also make our own way to Perth. There was no help on the ground, 1 staff trying to deal with 150 plus people that were understandably very upset. We had to take the refund option and then pay $2000 to a fly to Perth with Qantas. No help at all on the ground or trying to help people make other arrangements. It’s not good enough to leave people stranded tourists, old people and we also had young children ourselves. I would expect a full refund of the fair to Perth and a reimbursement of a Tigerair fair to Perth with such short notice. To leave people stranded is  very unfair and terrible customer service.

### "cheap is not always better"
Not Verified |  Never have I encountered a more poorly run airline. Our flight got cancelled due to bad weather conditions, which I can agree is a good call to make if it’s dangerous to fly. What amazes me by this though is that no effort was made by any of the team at Tiger Air to get us on a new flight. After doing my own research I found I could get a flight through Virgin or Qantas leaving 3 hours later but was going to cost me almost double in price to get it as it was a last minute flight. Flights cancel all the time, there is no stopping that. How the airline chose to deal with ‘paying back’ their customers, sending out random emails telling them they are lucky winners and can board the next available flight free of charge, while everyone else just goes home is just ridiculous. I learned as I walked away from the airport with all my luggage and missing the biggest competition of my career is that, cheap is not always better.

### "Really bad experience"
Perth to Sydney. After canceled the flight I originally booked, Tigerair just told us to take the next one available nearly 12 hours later. And after the ground staff promised to reimburse the traffic cost as it was midnight and I had to take taxi to get to the hotel. They refused to pay my transportation cost because they said they only supply the hotel. Really bad experience and not an honest airline.

### "subjectively target passengers"
On our return flight, TT247, to Melbourne from Sydney on the 27/05/18. Ground staff made it a point to subjectively target passengers in order to weigh their carry on luggage. My wife was a little uneasy knowing her luggage weighed right on the maximum allowed @ 7kg, but hadn't realised they would also be weighing most ladies handbags. And I say, "most ladies handbags", because the lady before us did not have to weigh her handbag along with her rather large duffel bag. However, after my wife's handbag and carry on bag weigh in came in at just under 8kg, staff insisted she pay an extra $36 dollars on the spot. When my wife and I protested her inconsistent procedure with the previous passenger, staff became rude and defensive, insinuating we were liars and further insisting we pay up right away. We  requested to speak with her supervisor, to which she rudely replied, "oh look, you can put a complaint in writing on our website if you like". At which point, both my wife and I became adamant about speaking with someone higher up in the ranking. And we were glad we did, because after describing this, so called, 'customer service' team member's unprofessional behaviour, we were both permitted to board the flight without further payment or harassment.

### "extremely uncomfortable"
The worst airline I have ever taken flying from Brisbane to Sydney. The aircraft smelt (both for my outbound and return flight), the seats and inflight environment were extremely uncomfortable. Unfriendly flight attendant, randomly picking passengers to weigh their luggage and let others slip away, which the way is very hard to understand. What matters is that the price is not that cheap, unless you pick a flight time of around 6 or 7 in the morning. Never again with Tigerair Australia.

### "introduced mobile baggage scales"
Sydney to Coffs Harbour A320. Tigerair have introduced a mobile baggage scales which is pushed along the boarding queue to check the weight of hand luggage to ensure it is within the 7kg allowance. Baggage over the allowance must be checked in at the gate for a fee. Boarding commenced about 25 mins prior to departure. The seats are reasonably comfortable and have a seat pitch of around 29 inches. Flight time to Coffs Harbour was 55mins and those seated on the left hand side of the aircraft had a great view of the Sydney CBD as the aircraft climbed towards the North. During the flight there are a reasonable range of food and beverage items available from the Inflight Menu Soft Drinks $4, Beer $8 Sandwiches for $9 and Snacks from $3.50. The cabin crew were friendly and attentive and we were kept well informed of the flights progress and weather in Coffs Harbour. The flight arrived into Coffs Harbour 5 mins ahead of schedule.

### "never fly with this airline again"
Adelaide to Melbourne. This is by far the worst airline we have ever gone with. The customer service is absolutely appalling, the stewardesses are rude and arrogant with no care to your problems. There is a limit of 7kg for carry on baggage (for a small suitcase and a handbag). After we had checked in we had bought presents from duty free; and they added this to the weight limit, refusing to let us remove the extra baggage and made us pay an extra 40 dollars. Along with this, they did not check all other customers baggage (that was clearly above 7kg), and completely ignored us when we were talking to them, and dismissed us as if we weren’t even there. We will never fly with this airline again, I can see why they have shit down in the past and have been on the brink of bankruptcy. They shouldn’t be allowed to operate.

### "not to accept luggage if we won't pay"
Sydney to Perth. Poor customer service. Very arrogant and rude ground staff. Charged for 30kg luggage when bag was only 24kg and put heavy sticker without writing actual weight of the luggage. Refused to communicate and threatened to not to accept luggage if we won't pay for 10kg over 20 kg allowed luggage. Spent 15 mins arguing when she was complaining about us being late. Had only three hand carries when 4 was included in ticket. We tried to communicate with her to remove extra weight from luggage to create another hand carry with bag that we had which she flatly refused. First, we were told $20 per weight which changed to $25 with saying that Perth customers get charged more due to Perth being far.

### "Appalling, disgraceful, shambles"
Adelaide to Sydney. Appalling, disgraceful, shambles, the list goes on. That an airline can operate in this country with this kind of service is makes a mockery of our governments responsibility. If you choose to fly Tigerair your are agreeing that this airline holds no respectability to its commitment to your transport requirements. The dollar you save now flying with Tigerair will cost you 5 times when they fail you, simply not worth the risk. Booked & paid for flight returning from Adelaide for a days business was cancelled the afternoon of the flight. Tigerair refused to put me on another flight for two days forcing me to pay at the airport more than 5 times the price of my already purchased ticket. How an airline can cancel a flight and not be required to find an alternative similar flight, or refund the cost of an alternate flight, is beyond me.

### "substandard everything"
Brisbane to Melbourne. How does an airline with such low standards receive permission to fly in this country? The others are bad enough but add to this one the sneaky act of charging you $46 extra because your carry-on luggage is a few grams over. Apart from that, substandard everything. Service, food, comfort. Only giving 1 because zero not available. Only fly very short trips with Tigerair Australia, and only if no other options are available.

### "never experienced such poor service"
Very disappointed with the 8am flight we took from Melbourne to the Gold Coast this morning! The staff were rude, there was no explanation for the fact that I was unable to take my freshly bought, sealed coffee aboard the flight considering there were other passengers that were clearly allowed their beverages in the plane. The air hostess was rude and argumentative when explaining safety procedures and when she asked if we had any questions and one of the passengers asked one, she preceded to tell him that he should have listened in the first place and to look at the safety procedure on the back of the seat. I will not be flying Tigerair again and will be informing everyone of our poor experience this morning. I also believe that although Tigerair purport to be a budget airline, you appear to profiteer from the meagre cabin bag allowance by charging customers extreme prices for small excess luggage. I fly often, both nationally and internationally for business and I have never experienced such poor service. Lift your game Tigerair or the passengers will speak with their money when they continue to book other airlines who are just as reasonably priced but offer a much better customer experience!

### "never fly with them again"
Melbourne to Cairns. Worst customer service. This is now the second time I have flown with Tigerair and I cannot wait to never do it again. Back home we do not weigh bags when they literally have attendants waiting at the front of the line waiting to do so before you board. Even if you are just a little over they will still make you pay a ridiculous amount. The first time I had to pay $36 and then the second time I had to pay $46. Where did the extra $10 come from. The price amount makes no sense on weight. I could be 1kg over and pay the same as someone who is 5kg. Not only that but the costumer service is very rude and not helpful at all. Will never fly with them again!

### "No offers of refunds"
Cairns to Brisbane. Flight cancelled. Other than one garbled intercom announcement there was no additional information about the new flight (15 hours later). No email or SMS updates. No information on Tigerair website. Unable to use initial check in information. No emergency accommodation, transport contingency from airport. No offers of refunds.

### "I waited patiently until 1pm "
Brisbane to Adelaide. Would not even consider to give 0.5 star. Arrived at the airport 12 noon for the check In while my domestic flight is 2pm and there is somehow a line special assistance required and I waited patiently until 1pm but they still could not figure out how to fix the problem. So I wait “patiently” again until 1.15pm and they got it fixed but I hope my luggage will arrive as I know luggage drop closed 45 minutes before departure.

### "No customer service at all"
Brisbane to Melbourne. A tale of two vastly different experiences. My flight from MEL to BNE was a flawless Tigerair experience. I even made a note of the cabin crew who went out of their way to help a couple who were having a large variety of issues. I was ready to write a glowing review. However, the leg from BNE to MEL was a disaster. The flight was delayed and so people were slowly notified whilst waiting at the gate. There were a number of ground staff about and they made everyone weigh their bags to ensure they were under the weight limit. No real updates, aside from a delay due to engineering. And then an SMS comes through over an hour later saying it had been cancelled. No notification from actual staff, and no staff at the gate. So, I called their call centre as advised in the SMS. I was told that a recovery flight was being organised but I would have to check in. I go down to the check in counter and there is one staff member, who is having IT issues. After about 20 minutes she still hasn't served those people, all the while the entire planeload of people have now formed a queue. There's also no visibility of other staff. Unfortunately for some, they are trying to check in for actual operating flights and they are getting noticeably quite distressed in the queue. About 45 minutes later Sebastien, a ground staff member, makes an announcement over the PA which can only be heard away from the queue. I then go and ask what the announcement said as there's about 40 people who were all going "what was he saying??". I'm advised there is no recovery flight and there are no seats out of Brisbane until at least the following day. There may be spots from the Gold Coast, but best option would be to check other airlines. I had to be back in Melbourne that day (noting I was on a 2.10pm flight, so not cutting it fine by any stretch of the imagination). I ended up flying Qantas. I have received no follow up from Tiger about the cancellation - no email about 'what to do now' or anything. After a few days, I contacted them to ask the process. I got a reply that completely ignored what I had said. Not even an offer to reimburse my original flight costs. So, after many glowing reviews on here (e.g. my review from late Jan - MEL:ADL) it seems that when Tigerair get things wrong, they really get them wrong. No customer service at all. Sorry, Tiger but you really dropped the ball.

### "I would never recommend Tigerair"
Gold Coast to Melbourne. Worst service ever. On 6th Mar I reached at the airport just 2 mins before the checkin close time. Departure time was 9:35 Am. I was just on time because there was bad weather and i had to travel to gold coast airport for about 45 mins where it should take about 20-25 mins on normal weather conditions. While i was searching for counter it took me about 2-3 mins and checkin was closed. I asked the staff to help me as its just about 3 mins, they said its very late now. You have to book another flight. Just 2-3 mins! They just wanted to earn money and this they didn't let me board-in. So I had to pay again for another flight on same day that was scheduled after about 5 hours. Such a bad experience. I would never recommend Tigerair to anyone. If this is the case, then if the flights are delayed, they should refund the money to customers, if they are so strict with customer checkin time.

### "Poor customer service"
Melbourne to Sydney. If I could give negative stars I would. Poor customer service Tiger, cancelled flight, no notification and no alternatives that night or the following morning. A credit note only on offer, no refund, a refusal in fact. I had to fly with another carrier at my own expense. Tiger said due to bad weather, yet Qantas, Virgin and Jetstar were still flying to Sydney. I will never fly Tiger.

### "atrocious customer service"
Airlie Beach to Brisbane. This airline is an absolute disgrace. We arrived early for check in even though we already checked in online. The lady working the till proceeds to tel us there is no express line, and to go in the same line as everyone else. We followed those instructions, then randomly she starts taking people through the express line who came to the airport after everyone else. This made our wait time even longer, and people who arrived after us and cut the line got top priority even though we did the same online check in and could’ve already been through. Our flight was supposed to leave at 9:15 am, and the airport has been calling people to go back through check in now to get a paper copy of their boarding passes instead of using the electronic ones on their smartphones. So people had to basically check in two times now, and we aren’t even close to boarding yet even though our flight was supposed to leave over 45 minutes ago. We have to catch a bus after the airport because our travel time doesn’t end after our flight. We are now most likely going to miss the bus we already paid for. We are frustrated, mad, and in disbelief at this atrocious customer service. This is the worst airline we have ever flown with and will not make this mistake of flying with them ever again!

### "a disgrace to the sky you use"
Booked on flight TT264, Melbourne to Sydney, 18.30. Flight delayed until 19.30, ok no big deal we can wait an hour. One hour later flight cancelled, yes the usual technical problems (as if anyone believes this anymore) and the plane is stranded on the Gold Coast. Tiger offered us a flight with Virgin at 7am the following morning which was too late for us. Why can't you fly us out tonight on Virgin, answer from a smarmy smirking young woman at the Tiger desk can't do it tonight. We need to be in Sydney tonight we told her, her response "Well you're not the only ones you know". Such empathy. How strange my wife an I were able to book a flight with Virgin leaving at 8pm but Tiger couldn't do the same thing for us. As far as I am concerned you are a disgrace to the sky you use.

### "a great flight as usual"
I travelled from Cairns to Brisbane on Tiger Australia on the 12th January 2018. It was a great flight as usual and very comfortable. It arrived into Brisbane after the last train had left but there was still a 11pm shuttle which I took to the Brisbane Transit Center. The driver of the shuttle actually dropped me off in the Brisbane CBD to help me out. I will travel on Tiger Australia in the future.

### "Never will I fly with them again"
Melbourne to Cairns. Never ever book Tiger Airways again. They have changed our flight times by over 8 hours and therefore we are going to miss basically a whole day of our stay near to the Barrier Reef. The car hire company are now closed when we arrive so we’ve had to book with another company at an extra cost. We’ve also paid for accommodation and missing out on that for the whole day. Their customer relations are unbelievably apathetic to it all, just basically stating their terms and conditions and we can have a refund, but it’s now too late to book with another airline because of the cost. Never will I fly with them again.

### "She was very rude to us"
Hobart to Melbourne. We checked in at about 1300hrs (6 Feb) with Tigerair in Hobart airport. The staff said "Give me ur passport or ID" without "please". She was very rude to us. Our luggage was 2kg over. We said we will throw 1 of our bag. Then she told another guy "remember these people's faces and check them again" and threatened us as if we were robbers. We paid money to fly and we shouldn't be treated as if she did a favor for us. We had a very good trip in Tasmania but thanks to this staff, we ended up with bad feelings because of not being treated like human beings. This is the second time we traveled with Tigerair. We were very happy with its service and staff except this time. I know this is low cost airlines but even it's cheap, we also have rights to be treated like human beings.

### "generally had excellent flights"
Melbourne to Adelaide. Good: The flight was at a great price point for a day before a public holiday (over $100 cheaper than the full service airlines per person), the cabin crew were friendly and professional, and the flight pushed back right on time and arrived 10 minutes early. The 737 seems to have more leg room than the A320 also used by Tiger. Pre-booked breakfast and the meal was quite tasty. Bad: The flight being rescheduled from 0820 to 0725. Not a killer, and they did give the option of moving flights or a full refund so there were other options available. Overall, I've generally had excellent flights with Tiger so I'm either 'lucky' or those who have good experiences don't bother with reviews.

### "Plane was not comfortable at all"
Cairns to Melbourne and back on Dec 1st. Both flights delayed for more than one hour. In Cairns, we were explained that the delay is due to ATC, however all the flights by the competitor were on time. Another delay on my way back. Moreover, at Melbourne domestic airport, all the shops and coffee outlets are closed at 10pm. Plane was not comfortable at all with a very limited leg room. When compared to European low cost airlines, which I am using frequently, this one was nowhere close. Information regarding the actual boarding time in both Cairns and Melbourne were chaotic. Overall, disappointing experience.

### "stranded in Melbourne"
Brisbane to Melbourne. This airline left 4 adults and 2 very small children stranded in Melbourne and the only flight they would offer was 2 days later with no compensation except a refund of the fare paid which would take 2 weeks. We were waiting on the phone for an hour and half, then a queue for the same time, to be told that due to technical difficulties our flight was not going. We had to buy other flights to enable us to catch later flights at another airport that night for 1 person and to be at our jobs for the others, the extra nights accommodation and taxi fares and flights left us out of pocket over $3000. They refuse to do anything. Travel insurance doesn't cover technical difficulties and credit cards don't cover domestic travel, they had 4 staff on the floor that had no idea what to do. We had no car, no milk, no nappies and apart from the stress we also lost hundreds of dollars for not getting back to work. This is appalling and i wonder if it is not a rip off.

### "hand luggage weighed 1kg too much"
Sydney to Melbourne. Forced to pay an extra $40 (more than half the ticket price) because my hand luggage weighed 1kg too much. Tigerair Australia is not as cheap as you think, they do nnot run on time, staff are rude and they do everything they can to squeeze money out of you.

### "take out all the things in my bag"
Melbourne to Perth. Okay service, but the lady who checked the inflight bag was a bit anal. Made me take out all the things in my bag to make sure its under 7kg sharp. That 7kg was including my Handbag. Otherwise asking to upgrade which I have to pay 40 something dollars.

### "acceptable for the price"
Melbourne to Hobart. I didn't expect much from such a low-cost airline and this was pretty much within my expectations. The section dedicated to Tigerair in Tullamarine airport wasn't bad, featuring decent chairs with power outlets in certain locations. What's worth noting is that prior to boarding, the ground crew will bring a weight scale to make sure you don't exceed your 7kg cabin baggage restriction. Once onboard (by walking across the tarmac, what do you expect? ), the cabin crew showed a positive attitude, and they seem very happy to help out passengers wither with difficulties locating their seats or placing oversized items into the overhead locker. The seat was acceptable for a 55-minute flight, the pitch was average and feels pretty comfortable. One thing to note is that is my case, the window was coated with a layer of grease, probably due to the previous passenger leaning his or her greasy hair against the table while sleeping. For some reasons, they seem to really like to use the reverse thrust, even with plenty of runway distance to spare. The overall experience was acceptable for the price, and yes, I would recommend it.

### "Clearly very unsatisfactory indeed"
Our 11.10 am flight from Melbourne to Sydney was cancelled, ostensibly due to "weather" (although at that time things in Melbourne seemed OK). We found out about this after arriving at the airport. We were rebooked on a flight at 6.25 pm the next day. We were told that this was the next flight with seats available. I know flying a budget airline means you take a risk that there might be a delay, but I find it extremely unsatisfactory that we were expected to wait for over a day for what should be a straight-forward flight from Melbourne to Sydney. The Tigerair staff at the airport offered no assistance and no compensation, and told us that that if we wanted to cancel the next day's flight, all we would receive would be a credit for the fare we had paid. Because of the excessive wait, we had no alternative but to pay "walk up" fares on another airline, and all we have from Tigerair is a credit but no refund. Clearly very unsatisfactory indeed.

### "Was quite pleasantly surprised"
Flew Melbourne to Canberra with Tigerair Australia. Was quite pleasantly surprised. Knowing they weigh hand luggage and handbag I pre-arranged 12kg during the booking process. Checked in online a few days ahead. The flight was on time leaving. Many elderly passengers on board. One ground crew member escorted an elderly passenger on board and other crew helped passengers find overhead locker space. I was impressed. All male crew, very friendly and the plane clean and comfortable enough for this short hop. You could buy food/drinks if you wanted to on board. Overall really good and happy I made a good decision in trying them. Won’t be the last time. Well done Tiger.

### "Tigerair screwed up everything"
Sydney to Melbourne. On Nov 16th, my flight was cancelled due to poor weather condition and Tigerair moved me to next day. I checked other airlines and they were still operating. Tigerair screwed up everything we had planned, wasted one day in Melbourne and one night accommodation. Had to book flights on other airline departure later that day. It's my first time with Tigerair and it will be the last time. Terrible Tigerair Australia.

### "Customer service was horrid"
Sydney to Melbourne. The main attraction was that they cater for a selection of dietary requirements. Being a Gluten Free Vegan the temptation of a Rowie’s Burger took over and I thought I would give them a shot. From the onset even before boarding my experience was horrible. The customer service was appalling - the stewardesses were rude and didn’t smile. I was  shocked they included my handbag (which can’t even fit a tablet in!) as weighed luggage. Upon paying for my .5 excess of 7kg luggage limit which was due to my handbag I was refused a receipt. The staff  also did not have change for a $50 note and had to request smaller change or to somehow get change for her current float. After that incident I was sitting when I was approached several times asking to re-weigh my bags which I said I had. They had no record of my weighing - and requested a receipt. I went back to the stewardess at the counter and requested a receipt in light of the circumstances. It seemed she did not know how to issue one, after calling for her she advised me I have to go to another gate as her printer was down. After going to two other Tiger gates it seems the third gate was the only one able to print. Eventually when I did board - after the delayed departure they seemed to miss my pre-ordered meal. I reminded them 30 mins prior to the scheduled landing that I had a pre-ordered meal. I was promptly given  my allocated drink but was disallowed from having my tray down as we had begun our descent. They offered me a chicken or beef sandwich in compensation to my misplaced meal - which was a silly offer as I clearly ordered a dietary specific menu item. I was finally treated to my pre-ordered in-flight meal which arrived once I landed. Not only was it overcooked and the box it was served it had leaked sauce in but it was also cold. There was no point ordering food at all. All in all for an $89 flight, $13 in-flight meal and $36 luggage fee I may as well of forked out the extra $20 and flown a seamless journey with Virgin. Customer service was horrid, their operational rules had double standards and the food was lack lustre.

### "False economy using Tiger"
Adelaide to Sydney. Flight cancelled again by Tigerair. Didn't know until I got to the airport. 2 hr queue to service desk only to be told flight rescheduled to following day. Meaning wasted day in Adelaide. Couldn't wait so re-booked with another airline at own expense. And this is not the first time. Frequent cancellations at the airport and re-scheduling. What is the point of a low fare ticket if you end up paying heaps more for last minute ticket with another airline. Last minute cancellations and re-timing are the norm with Tiger. False economy using Tiger. Avoid unless you are very flexible with your time, have no commitments and have lots of spare cash on hand to pay for flight on a reliable airline at the last minute. Fly Tiger at your own peril. I would give them a 0 rating but website won't let me.

### "incompetent and insensitive"
Sydney to Melbourne. After arriving at Sydney airport on 23/9/2017 at 10:30 (2hrs before departure), I received a sms stating my flight had been cancelled due to "engineering requirements", my new flight would be on 24/9/2017 at 13:50. I'll admit I didn't notice the date change, originally thought we had been delayed by 2 hours. I showed one of the check-in staff (who also didn't notice the date change), she told me I couldn’t check-in until 12pm (2 hrs before the new flight). So my toddler and I sat around the airport for 1.5hrs, frustrated but fine. When I tried to check-in at noon it was pointed out to me that my flight was not until the following day. My toddler and I were flying to Melb for my Mum's 70th b’day dinner (which was a big deal as my Mum has been fighting stage 4 cancer for the last year - family were coming from interstate, it was much needed celebration). When I explained the importance of our trip I was told I could try another airline (which by this stage were sold out - it was the footy finals and start of school hols), get a refund, go on standby or come back tomorrow. I wasn't pleased with any of the options, but thought the best chance was to go standby. So we waited another 2.5hrs. I asked if we would get a food voucher for a sandwich for my daughter and got a very blunt "no". At 2:30 after the final call for the 3:15 Melbourne flight, we went back to the original check-in girl (who had stated that she had put us "top of the standby list"), she told us "40 passengers are yet to book in, so it looks good for you" (so we were feeling relieved) 20mins later another staff member came & told us (& 6 other passengers who had gone standby after the cancellation) the flight was booked & the best they could offer was a 7am flight. The 7am flight was not an option for us. I then had to try & sort my airport parking, fun, fun. On our return flight, somehow my toddler and I were assigned seats in different rows! The cabin staff told me this had happened twice on the flight already. They did their best to reshuffle people, but we ended up sitting with an aisle between us. I emailed Tiger with my complaints and suggested compensation of Tiger credit to fly later in the year. They offered their "sincere apologies" but told me because I didn't take out insurance they were not going to offer any compensation. This baffled me!? Instead of offering $100 they would rather have a very unsatisfied customer? So I emailed them again and was told "we appreciate your understanding in this matter". I know flying a budget airline you take a risk of being delayed - but delayed by an hour or two, not 26! And not to be told then too bad, take out insurance next time. I wont be flying Tiger again, they’re incompetent and insensitive.

### "never fly TigerAir again"
Melbourne to Sydney. My wife and I were booked to fly on 9th July on flight TT272 departing at 7:40pm. We arrived at the airport in time to check in and were notified the flight had been cancelled. The ground staff provided no further information and did not show any interest in providing help or advice. After hunting around for the TigerAir office along with a bunch of other passengers who were booked on the same flight we finally found what were looking for and was then told to wait outside, someone would be along to help. After 15 minutes a ground staff person did come by and explained that we were all booked for a flight the next morning. When asked what we were supposed to do until then we were advised that we could make our own arrangements for accommodation and be reimbursed for the cost, again no help was offered to assist. It was now after 9pm so through the Visitors Centre located in the airports concourse I found a room at the local Best Western motel and paid for it at the Centre to lock in the booking. We arrived at the hotel and checked in ok, and the next morning caught the flight to Sydney. 2 days later I contacted TigerAir to request he promised reimbursement. Since then I have exchanged over 18 emails with TigerAirs Customer Care team - a misnomer if ever their was one - with repeated request from them to supply proof of hotel expense which I did each time the request was made. All to no avail. On the 2nd September I raised a complaint with the Airline Customer Care Advocate, supplied copies of the requested documents and have followed up with them for a resolution, again to no avail Its now 12 weeks since I first asked for my reimbursement, something that TigerAir's own website says is their policy to provide, and still no resolution. I will never fly TigerAir again, even if that means I have to catch a bus or train instead.

### "surprised and impressed"
Melbourne to Hobart. I was surprised and impressed. This was my first journey with Tigerair Australia and the service was very friendly and efficient. I pre booked a tasty meal (sandwich and orange juice) which was fine for such a short flight. I was also able to purchase a beer. Flight left and arrived on time .

### "Absolutely atrocious service"
Hobart to Melbourne. Absolutely atrocious service. They delayed our flight by 5 hours with no warning whatsoever. At the departure gates, we were informed that there would be a further delay of 2 hours. Not a single bit of compensation or an apology from the airline. First and last time with this terrible airline operator.

### "expect me to pay for their error"
Gold Coast to Melbourne. I checked in online for a flight and received a confirmation text that had a working link in it but when I went to board the plane, the link went to an error and I was told that I wasn't checked in and that the text was checking me into a flight that I had already travelled on (which isn't possible). I had to them book another flight and travel from the Gold Coast to Brisbane to take it so I could get home. Once home, I wrote a complaint to them and they admitted that it was a system error on their end that had caused this but advised that it was my responsibility to know this and therefore would not provide any compensation. I cannot believe that they expect me to pay for their error. This takes incompetence and appalling customer service to another whole level

### "good value for money"
Melbourne to Sydney. The good value for money airline, however the flight was delayed by half an hour. The legroom was reasonable for a budget airline and the cabin crew were friendly. But, the Rowie's Veggie Burger had rock-hard bun and tasted terrible. I recommend to just fly with Tigerair and escape the food.

### "Disgusting service"
Sydney to Brisbane. Disgusting service, horrible staff. Left me and my 2 children stranded after they stuffed up our flight times without batting an eyelid. I was then told to purchase my 3rd set of return tickets through them for the next day. Flew home happy on Virgin instead!

### "will never fly them again"
Melbourne to Brisbane. Never flown Tiger before and I will never fly with them again. 4 hrs at Melbourne airport, missed function as a result Our early morning return flight was cancelled, (family group of 5) 3 were transferred to a Virgin flight 9 hrs later, 2 were rescheduled to the following night. No responsibility or ownership by Tiger was extremely disappointing. You get what you pay for - cheap tickets then you have to pay for overnight accomodation because they cannot get you home on the day you booked to return. And told there is no chance of being compensated.

### "Flight itself went fine"
Sydney to Cairns. As with all budget airlines, most items were dealt with electronically (booking, check in, queries) and baggage and seat allocation were extra. No surprises there and all was handled hassle free. Check in at Sydney went without a hitch with most staff pleasant with the exception of 1 who was rather officious. Checked in suitcase was half a kilo over which I expected some comment / charge but not so - well done. Hand luggage was randomly checked (ours weren't) for 7kg weight limit. Boarding again not an issue and departure was slightly delayed but kept informed. Flight itself also went fine. Return flight from Cairns, web check in all fine. Checked in suitcase was 2 kilos over, of which a payment of $28 was requested. We declined and re-arranged into hand luggage which fortunately were not weighed as they would've been over. Everything else went as planned. It would seem that should everything go as planned, this airline is fine. Can't comment on what would happen if flights get delayed / cancelled which fortunately did not happen to us as we had a Sydney to London flight to catch 24 hours later.

### "put me on a Virgin flight"
I fly Tigerair domestically and my friends have always thought I was mad to trust this airline. Their perceptions were verified on 20 July this year. I was flying Sydney to Brisbane connecting via a TG flight from London. While i was transitting in bangkok i received an e-mail from Tigerair cancelling my 11.15 flight and instead put me on a 15.15 flight. When I got to sydney domestic airport I found out that my 15.15 flight was cancelled as well. On inquiring at the desk I was told that there were no more Tigerair flights to Brisbane and I should look at buying a jetstar flight the next day. When asked why the flights were cancelled I was given the old chestnut "operational reasons". They offered me a refund. I said that I had been travelling for more than 24 hours, and had no energy to go around Sydney looking for accomodation. My entreaties worked and the Tigerair attendent put me on a Virgin flight to Brisbane. He asked me not tell any of my fellow travellers that I had managed to get a flight to Brisbane. Lessons learnt, do not fly Tigerair if you have an international connection

### "pleasant and professional"
Sydney to Adelaide and Tigerair return fare was best value. A couple of annoying events, the first of which was the booking and on-line check in on the Tigerair site. Like most people I don’t want to have a multitude of advertisements hitting on me while I’m trying to concentrate on the booking. I ended up with email spam from the Tigerair affiliates. Similarly, the on-line check in is also unnecessarily complicated when it could be so simple. Pre-boarding I asked for an aisle seat and the Tigerair staffer was so polite and helpful and the seat was changed with no fuss at all. At boarding lounge 49 the ground crew announcements were spoken so fast it was unintelligible. One passenger asked me what was said and I was unable to tell him. When I very politely suggested to the Tigerair staffer to slow down his delivery, he replied, “Other passengers can understand it”. If so, why are the passengers lining up in the wrong places and at wrong times? The flight was uneventful with friendly cabin attendants and punctual departure and arrival. A late-morning flight ADL to SYD was booked but on-line check in was a problem as I had no internet access for 24 hours. I found a Tigerair staffer in the airport who kindly directed me to the check-in area. Arriving there, there was no check in desk open. Within two minutes, the same Tigerair staffer offered to help me. He was friendly, efficient did the check in and seat allocation in about 2 minutes. Later at the boarding gate his announcements were clear, precise and audible, unlike his female offsider who could not be heard above the noise of the passengers. The flight departed 10 minutes late and arrived 10 minutes late. The on board crew were pleasant and professional and the flight proceeded smoothly.

### "cancelled very late in the evening"
Flight was cancelled very late in the evening. Tigerair initially blamed the weather, which was quite wet at the time but others seemed to be coping with it. I was able to get onto a Jetstar flight at my own additional cost. Since that date (9th June 2017) I have been in touch with Tigerair via email, seeking an explanation as to their cavalier attitude to my needs on that night. They eventually conceded that it wasn't the weather, but 'Engineering Requirements', but have since sought to alter that to 'Engineering Requirements and weather'. They have also refused to discuss why it took so long to advise that the flight was cancelled. I have discovered that the aircraft concerned was still airborne on its way to Melbourne from Cooloongatta at the time it should have been leaving Melbourne for Sydney (6.25 pm), but it took Tigerair until 8.20 pm to send their 3 line email cancelling the flight. Someone in Tigerair should have known by 6.25 pm at the latest that there was a problem. Tigerair refused to discuss this aspect of their service, except to say how hard their job is.

### "big thumbs up from a seasoned traveller"
Tigerair were fabulous - from ground crew to cabin crew to pilots. Everyone was friendly, efficient and helpful. This was the inaugural Brisbane to Perth flight. Many people knock LCC but here is the deal. Confirm booking (including seat allocation) as early as you can, carry the correct weight baggage and get to the airport and correct gate in plenty of time. It`s just too easy. Flights were both on time and very comfortable, although 2C needs wonky armrest fixing. Reasonable drinks and snack prices and plenty of water offered. I got the special deal of $200 return - an absolute bargain for first class service from everyone. Well Done Tiger AU - a big thumbs up from a very seasoned traveller.

### "get what you pay for - terrible service"
I have never in my life been more disappointed in an airline. Tigerair has to be the worst airline I have ever dealt with. My partner and I are having dinner with a few friends on Friday night, excited for our flight from Sydney to Melbourne the next morning – only to be dimmed when we receive a message saying they cancelled our 8.15am Saturday flight and they have put us on the flight at 3.15pm on Sunday. They could only put us on a flight 38 hours after they cancelled our first one. Because this was only a weekend away and we were leaving Tuesday – I brought a flight on Saturday with Virgin who were much more understanding and helpful. $600 down, Virgin did everything to make sure we were happy and tried to accommodate us after hearing how Tigerair treated us. When I asked Tiger for a refund for this, we were refused one and said the best they can do is a credit. Are you serious? Like I’m ever going to use this airline again. Yes, the flights are cheaper however, you get what you pay for - terrible service. Wouldn’t you prefer to pay $100 or so extra and be guaranteed a flight when you book it for and even better customer service from anyone else.

### "another Australian rip off"
This review is based on 2 return trips for my sons from Sydney to meet me in Perth. For the return leg, we were emailed/SMS just four hours before departure. They claimed simply Operational reasons - no further information whatsoever. After calling Customer service and in total over 60 minutes on phone, they agreed to put us in hotel in Perth. We checked with Hotel and there was no booking made for us, so we made alternative accommodation booking. everything was so inconvenient. My sons were re-booked next day on different flights back to sydney using Virgin OZ. one of those flights was re-booked by virgin themselves, without telling us untill at counter, meaning the Son.2 didn't get back until 24hrs after the scheduled return with Tigerair. Well they got back safely. But no compensation at all for the delay and loss of ones days work, and over 300km extra driving and all other expenses. Im used to Europe where after 4hrs Airline pays delay money and expenses. Whats make this Worse, i had Purchased Tigerair insurance. Which in fact is covered by CHUBB.com.AU, and you have to make the claim on seperate forms, receipts etc, not obvious when you buy the insurance. And they do not pay anything when its tiger-air problems- Classed as Operation Reasons. yet another Australian rip off. TIP, if you can afford it use a better airline. and if you are tempted by the Good prices. Dump the Insurance.

### "extra kgs over their 40kg limit"
Gold Coast to Sydney. Very disappointed with Tigerair Australia baggage policy and will never fly again with them. I was on a flight to Sydney to catch a connecting intercontinental flight. I had two pieces of luggage over 20kgs and when I checked in was told not to worry that i would be given consideration and a solution would be found (as on line one can only add and pay for extra 8kg only). Finally on top of the 60AUD ticket and another 30 dollars for an extra piece of luggage, Tigerair charged me 320AUD for extra kgs over their 40kg limit at check in. Customer service was no better and four months later told me that its my fault. No customer respect.

### "unprofessional, money grabbing vulture"
Hobart to Melbourne. My how the worm turns from being a beneficial symbiotic relationship to a greedy, unprofessional, money grabbing vulture. This ultra LCC really needs to justify it's existence. Incompetent, rude and full of self-importance, this airline has one flight each day from Hobart to Melbourne. No other destination from the Capital City of Tasmania is offered. Communication and Customer Service are foreign words to these amateur fabulosi. As quick as taking a glimpse over your shoulder, these fools will change the rules and leave you hanging without any means of transport! The score I give is only because I cannot give a negative rating: such a pity. Never again. I have a choice of three other airlines, and I will gladly share my hard earned dollars with them.

### "crew were friendly and efficient"
Very good experience with Tigerair from Sydney to Melbourne. Flight was on time and ground staff friendly. Cabin crew were friendly and efficient and onboard food and beverages was competitively priced. I wouldn't hesitate in flying Tigerair next time I travel within Australia.

### "definitely better than Jetstar"
Sydney to Melbourne. Great experience, flight left on time and landed on time! Boarded the aircraft promptly, aircraft was in good condition, cabin crew were pleasant and overall the flight was definitely better than that of a Jetstar flight. I would use Tiger Australia again for that reason!

### "refund should be provided"
Adelaide to Melbourne. Poor customer service from Tigerair Australia. The flight was cancelled due to "poor weather" even though there was no rain in in both departure and arrival cities. No refund was provided, only a credit which lasted 6 months, which is impractical for people who do not travel often. If the flight is cancelled, a full refund should be provided by the airline.

### "don't fly with Tigerair"
Cairns to Brisbane on Tigerair Australia. Scheduled departure at 3.25pm. Delay info at 9:00am (delay 75 mins due to "Crew requirements"). Arriving at the airport at 1:40pm, info about further delay of total 3 hours 15 mins due to "Engineering requirements". No Tigerair agent at the airport. Hotline only offers to change the flight to a later one, but no cancellation. We decide to fly with Virgin at 4:30 pm and ask Tigerair to cover our additional cost. Tigerair rejects. We ask Airline Customer Advocate to assist. Tigerair offers a flight credit in the amount of the tickets purchased, valid for 6 months. Info that we don't plan any further flights and that they should credit the amount to our credit card. Tigerair rejects. Second flight (already booked and paid) from Sydney to Melbourne delayed by 2,5 hours! Better don't fly with Tigerair.

### "231 dollars for one luggage"
Sydney to Melbourne. I apparently had not paid for a check in luggage (my fault, no problem) but when I got to the airport they charge me with AUS $231 dollars for only one luggage. The ticket itself cost 75, guess how that makes their customers feel. I do blame myself for not purchasing this myself beforehand, but I deeply regret choosing Tigerair now that I know this is "how they get you". I will travel a lot in Australia and will actively avoid scheduling more flights with this company.

### "were smiling and efficient"
Perth to Sydney. Queue at check-in was short and ground staff friendly. The seat looked a bit old, but otherwise was rather comfortable. For once managed to catch a little bit of sleep (I usually do not manage to). Impressed with the diversity of the cabin crew and they were smiling and efficient. For a budget airline departing late at night and arriving ahead of schedule, that was impressive. Decent value of money and I would say their level of service is superior to their Singapore counterparts.

### "staff friendly and smiling"
Flew SYD-MEL-SYD with Tigerair with mixed outcomes. The was the first time flying Tiger after a very unpleasant experience in 2005 in Singapore. For SYD-MEL while waiting in the boarding lounge a Tigerair staffer approached me asking if I’d like priority boarding and an exit row seat at no cost. Gratefully accepted, but 10 minutes before the scheduled departure, no aircraft had arrived. It was obvious we would be late departing. After boarding, we all sat like dummies to be told after a period that the flight would not be leaving for 45 minutes as we’d lost our place in the queue for take-off. The 0845 departure became 0940. Priority boarding is a waste under such circumstances. Inflight service was fine, and the staff friendly and smiling. The food and drinks are competitively priced. MEL-SYD began boarding at 1800 for an 1825 departure. Again, once boarded we were told that bad weather in Sydney had delayed arrivals and departures and we’d be held captive for an hour so Sydney air traffic could be sorted. It’s not Tigerair’s fault, but why were we boarded and why were we kept on the plane when we could have returned to the boarding lounge. Finally push back was 1905 and the uneventful flight landed in Sydney 30 minutes late at 2029. Again, the cabin crew were friendly, smiling and made very clear announcements.

### "great experience"
First time flying with Tigerair Australia on a short weekend trip to Brisbane from Sydney. Early flight out of Sydney on Friday morning with easy hassle free boarding at domestic terminal. No carry on bag weight check. Short delay in take off - due to airport issues not airline. Good flight up to Brisbane, pretty full plane, in flight snacks/beverages offered, staff friendly, good landing and disembarkation. Great experience. Return leg late Sunday, easy check in at terminal, all carry on luggage checked/weighed at gate, easy boarding, great flight to Syd, very quick easy disembarkation. Very happy with the overall standard and service on ground an in air with Tiger.

### "staff fantastic and the plane spotless"
Tigerair Australia gets some pretty scathing reviews at times but they usually begin with "I was only 5 minutes late" or "My case was only 1 kg over". Here is a tip, arrive on time and pack correctly and you will experience one of the best budget airlines flying at the moment. We flew Tiger to and from Denpasar (from Perth) and the total experience was faultless. The flight departed on time and arrived early at both destinations, the food was tasty, the staff fantastic and the plane spotless. I checked the departure and arrival times for the 10 days preceding my trip and it was all the same, depart on time and arrive on time. Many full fare airlines would welcome a standard like that. The total experience was perfect, well done to all at Tigerair Australia for how you have turned this airline around.

### "avoid this airline at all costs"
We booked our flight 2 months prior and received an email the night before saying the flight from Brisbane to Sydney has been cancelled due to poor weather conditions. However, Tigerair Australia have other flights leaving on the same day running the same route and we have been told the next nearest flight is 2 days away. It took 40 minutes to get through to the call centre to be told Tigerair Australia are not running any more planes to compensate and will not cover hotel costs. I then asked about a refund which would take 3-4 weeks to process how utterly ridiculous!! They provided very little help and I have a strong feeling it has been cancelled due to something not relating to the weather. Even though this airline is cheap there is definitely a reason for it, they provide shocking customer service and definitely do not put their customers first. Do yourself a favour and avoid this airline at all costs before they ruin your travel plans and cause stress and wasted money.

### "cabin service friendly"
Melbourne to Hobart and overall a good experience with Tigerair. Cheap flight, and more importantly an on time departure - somewhat of a novelty during the early evening Friday slot at Melbourne airport. Cabin service was friendly. Admittedly, the seats are packed in very tight. Although on a short flight such as this leg it's manageable. Little touches such as a wrapped serviette on a bottle of bubbles are nice. As are smiles from the crew. Return leg took off on time and arrived 10 min ahead of schedule. Excellent timing.

### "flight was pleasantly surprising"
I was very hesitant to fly Tigerair from Brisbane to Sydney, given its reputation as the budget of all budget airlines, and some not so good reviews in the past. On top of that, I am also a nervous flyer. However, this flight was pleasantly surprising. I happened to arrive at the airport very early and had problems working the check-in machines so a friendly Tigerair staff member checked in for me and then kindly offered to move me to a great exit-aisle seat. The plane itself was clean and comfortable - even nicer than the Jetstar flight I took on the outgoing flight. The flight was slightly delayed due to bad weather in Sydney (as were other flights) but otherwise very smooth and on time. Flight attendants also very friendly and helpful. The only annoying part is their carry-on baggage restrictions - everyone had to have their bag weighed before boarding to make sure they were under 7kg. I got through with 7.5kg but I heard someone having to pay $53 because they were over. So take this as a warning! Overall though, happy to do it again and recommend to others.

### "they have lost a customer"
Tigerair Australia flight back to Gold Coast from Sydney. I wanted to stay in Sydney one extra day so Tiger charged me $50 per ticket change flight fee and an $8 credit card fee per ticket so a total of $232.00 ($58 x 4 tickets) to move my flight from Tuesday 19/4/16 to Wednesday 20/4/16, this was of course on top of the original ticket prices $230 and I did this with over 48 hours notice. We get to Sydney airport ready for departure and waiting at gate 58 to board the flight as were waiting in line the Tiger staff start walking up the line weighing and measuring everyone's luggage - they measured my carry on bag, it being 2 inches over their length limit I was charged $83 to put my bag into the bottom of the plane. They may think it's a clever way to catch people off guard with no other option than to pay or leave your bag but they have lost a customer.

### "experience was good"
Flew with Tigerair Australia return Perth to Sydney for business and overall our experience was good. We got to Perth airport quite early (approx. 2.5 hours before check-in opened). The flight was departing at 2am, and the check-in was meant open at midnight - the desk and queue were already setup. We got in line at about 1150pm - there was a flight to Melbourne with Tigerair leaving earlier than our flight, and people were already checking in. After midnight passed there was a huge line behind us waiting to check in for Sydney - we started to get impatient and wondered what was going on. I went to ask at another Tigerair desk and staff told me that the check-in for Sydney was in the same line as the check-in for Melbourne. Nobody from Tigerair bothered to change the screen or come tell us, despite the fact we were all waiting in a hopeless line. We all transferred to the other line, which took forever. We were actually getting nervous about missing our flight. Only 2 people checking in 2 full flights. Once on the plane, our trip was great. The seat recline was good and I was able to get some sleep on the overnight flight. The flight attendants are personable and polite, and will assist you with anything you need. On landing, our bag was wet, but it had been raining so that's not really their fault. When checking in for Sydney to Perth, it was yet another check-in nightmare. We used the self-check-in to print off our tickets, thinking it would be faster, and I jumped in the short bag drop line. At this time, the check in for a flight to Melbourne was open as well, and because this flight left earlier they allowed Melbourne passengers to go first. No big deal but after the check-in for Melbourne was supposed to be closed, they still allowed people to cut in front of us, and we had been waiting patiently for close to 45 minutes. This was the only complaint I have. When on the flight, it was great like before.

### "the check in was closed"
We arrived to Adelaide airport 44 min before our flight to Sydney with Tigerair to find out that the check in was closed (domestic check-in closes 45 minutes prior to departure). We went to Tigerair service desk to be told that the next available flight is 4 days from today and the staff were disrespectful. They were not interested at all to help. I asked to speak to a manager and was refused saying there nothing a manager would do. We booked the flight through one of the travel sites and did not see the fine print. The airline view was you booked through a travel agent so bad luck. This was the Ester weekend and everything was booked out. We ended up paying $2000 to get home to Sydney.

### "send a big thank you"
I'd like to send a big thank you to the flight attendants on Tigerair Australia flight TT213. We left Sydney at 7am on Monday 21st March. On arriving in Melbourne I realized I had lost a ring. I reported this to the attendant and said that it was possibly in my bag as I had been getting things out of it on the flight. I asked her if she would check around my seat (2D) after the passengers had left the plane. When I was leaving Melbourne on Sunday I asked at the information desk and after checking, the attendant came back with my ring. The ring was very valuable and especially of sentimental value. I make regular flights from Sydney to Melbourne and back home with Tiger and will most certainly continue to do so in the future. Thank you once again.

### "no longer be using Tigerair"
Melbourne to Sydney. My luggage did arrive on my flight, it was left in Melbourne. As it was the last flight of the evening, there was no ground staff or service desks open to assist me. It took me 4 phone calls the next morning to find someone who could assist me, (Tigerair said we don't deal with that bad luck). Finally the last phone call I was finally told my luggage was in Melbourne but couldn't have my suitcase delivered as I hadn't lodged a complaint the night before. I now have to drive 1.5 hours to pick it up. She then argued with me that there was staff there and that I didn't look. The only person there was security who pushed us out the door and said bad luck! Extremely disappointed in Tigerair service and Sydney airport. My partner lives in Sydney and I in Melbourne so we travel back and forth every month. We will no longer be using Tigerair.

### "pleasant flight with little fuss"
I flew Tigerair Australia from Sydney to Melbourne and back. They seem to offer a no frills, cheap service. The aircraft was modern and clean, cabin crew were nice, the leg room was decent in comparison to the low fare I paid. You can purchase food and drinks on board. Before boarding the plane, they do weigh your land luggage, and if it is over the allocated amount, they will charge you a fee at the gate (you can purchase extra baggage allowance online though). Make sure before getting to the aircraft that your luggage is within the allowed limits. All in all it was a pleasant flight with little fuss.

### "have an amazing flight"
It's amazing what one can find when shopping around online! My mate and I were heading up to the Sunshine Coast for a holiday, and discovered super-cheap airfares to Brisbane with Tigerair Australia. Once baggage fees and credit card fees were added, the return fare amounted to some $80 return (Qantas and Virgin usually charge $200 one way)! The flight to Brisbane on TT316 was immaculate. We both received exit row seats, and as we were in 1A/B we were also the first to disembark. The food available for purchase is about the same standard as other low-cost carrier, but real highlight was how attentive and friendly flight attendants were. This was the same on the return when we were offered exit row, and looked after with fantastic service. The return flights with Tiger at bargain basement prices topped off what was an amazing holiday to Noosa. If the price is right, I would definitely consider Tiger again. People must remember that this is a low-cost carrier, so they will have stricter rules regarding check-in times and baggage limits. But if you follow all instructions, you won't be bothered, and like us, you'll have an amazing flight!

### "don't book with Tigerair"
Booked a morning flight from Melbourne to Adelaide with Tigerair. 2 weeks before the flight they moved us to their evening flight without warning, to accommodate a group booking on the morning flight. We had to book another ticket with a different airline. If you want to be sure that you'll take the flight you want, don't book with Tigerair.

### "on time and efficient"
On time and efficient flight with Tigerair Australia from Sydney to Melbourne. My last two Jetstar flights were firstly cancelled and then on the return delayed. To be fair that's normal with a bad weather day on the east coast of Australia. The trip to Melbourne with Tiger was accompanied by FA's with no interest apart from with their own appearance. Return trip was great. Flying with them again next week which should be fine.

### "service generally good"
I always enjoy flying Tigerair Australia on this short 35 minute flight, the fares are always great and I find the A320 a nice aircraft. Service generally good and never encountered any delays with this service. Tiger should consider flying the route more than 3 times a week as my flights have always been full.

### "flights were on time"
I flew round Australia this month with Tigerair Australia and all my flights were on time. The food is pretty good and nice staff. Queue Jump is worth it. However, watch the excess baggage charges. It cost me $122 for 5 kg of Christmas presents! Also seats are cramped and no knee room for tall people.

### "left us stranded"
Tigerair Australia left us stranded at Sydney airport and couldn't offer us anything until the next day, after they cancelled our flight. We were told by staff at Sydney airport that we could have a full refund and go and try to get home with another airline, so we did exactly that. Conveniently they didn't have the facilities to give us a refund at the airport and asked us to call their 1300 number. After an hour on the phone they asked us to email. Now they are ignoring my emails. Cheap and nasty! Will never fly with them again.

### "ridiculous baggage policy"
I had booked a Tigerair Australia flight for my family of 4 to fly from Sydney to Cairns. We had no problem on the flight up but on the way back (with the same luggage) we were told that my carry-on had to be checked in. We were then told that we were overweight and had to pay an additional $600.00 AUD ($454.00 US)! That was $25.00 AUD per kilo. The girl at the check-in counter just stood there "stone-faced" and said that was the policy. We weren't even allowed to re-arrange our luggage. We had no choice but to pay. The plane was only partially filled so there was no weight problem. I tried to dispute it with Tigerair Australia and my credit card when we got home but was told we received the service. I have never heard of an airline having such a ridiculous baggage policy. Wish I knew what our Australian friends knew before I booked on Tigerair Australia!

### "flights arrived early"
Adelaide to Melbourne with Tigerair Australia was fantastic. Checking in was smooth, flights left on time and arrived early on both outbound and inbound sectors. No hesitation in booking with them again.

### "exceeded our expectations"
My wife and I flew 3 times with Tigerair Australia during October 2015, first to Cairns then to Sydney and back to Melbourne. They exceeded our expectations, everything was smooth from check in to baggage claim and on time or ahead of time. No hesitation to recommend Tigerair.

### "the price has gone way up!"
Not the price that Tigerair Australia advertise. You think your getting a deal when you look at the price but after you go through the online booking the price has gone way up! Pay the extra for the other airline. (Don't check your bag) I booked a flight online from Sydney to Cairns with one checked in bag. Once I got to the airport they told me I had two checked in bags and no bags for the return trip. They said they couldn't do anything about it. At this point I experienced the non-customer service that Tigerair Australia is famous for. Be very careful when selecting baggage and double check once you have ticked off your return trip because it will change your first selection on baggage. Never mind talking to any staff at the airport. They are very friendly but direct you to their website for any problems. The website is a joke, if you call the customer service number they tell you it's not their problem and direct you back to the website. If you try emails you will get a response only to say you have reached the wrong department and they direct you back to the website. I even asked to talk to a manager and was refused. No one at Tigerair Australia will take responsibility for anything. So remember if you check a bag with Tigerair you may have to leave it at your destination or pay again to bring it home with you as I did.

### "be aware of the rules"
Tigerair Australia advertise themselves as a "no frills" carrier, and they deliver on that promise, being efficient, courteous and friendly. (They currently have the best ontime performance of all 4 main carriers in Australia.) The aircraft are clean and tidy, seats are no better or worse than any other economy seat, and the cabin crew, whilst providing minimal interraction with passengers, are friendly. The only downside is that optional catering is expensive. Better to purchase food and beverages at the supermarket on the way. Also, staff at the boarding gates will enforce the rules rigidly - and will not negotiate. Passengers need to be aware of the rules of their airfare when flying with Tigerair in Australia. Don't check in late. Keep to your bag limits. No problems!

### "flight staff were excellent "
Scored some $20 flights in a Tigerair Sale from Sydney to Adelaide, and was making the trip with two friends and their child, One of my friends was suffering morning sickness mid flight. The flight staff were excellent organizing a free row for her to lay down in. Amazing Service.

### "fantasy charges in baggage"
Tigerair  is one of the worst I have flown with. The staff is unfriendly, even if they see that disabled people might need assistance with bags they don't make a move. The prices they charge for a little overweight are ridiculous! For 3 kilos more than prepaid they charged me 40AUD. They may have the lowest fares but also the lowest service quality and friendliness I have experienced. They are focused on charging fantasy charges in baggage.

### Tigerair Australia customer review
This was our first experience with Tigerair, and going by many reviews we were a bit trepidus especially as we were flying with a 5 month old baby. The experience however was very smooth and for a low cost airline, I really cannot fault them. The staff were professional and helpful at every point, boarding was smooth, the flights departed and arrived on time and baggage collection was simple. They obviously have a very quick turn around at each airport, so seats etc aren't spotless, but not disgraceful either. There are definitely no frills to the service, but we didn't expect them either - we get what we pay for. I wouldn't hesitate to fly with them again if I was looking for a budget, straight forward flight.

### Tigerair Australia customer review
We travelled MEL to SYD return last week and had the most appalling experience. Firstly, the access to Tigerair Terminal in Melbourne is long, no rails and wet and dirty surface. To navigate the narrow access takes at least 10 extra minutes, walking: no escalators, no moving path. This condition has lasted for the past 10 years we are told. And you always have to climb the steps to get to the plane, no connecting luxury. There was an unexplained delay with no apology, staff irritated when you ask the reason. The waiting rooms were overcrowded with three delayed flights customers, loud and littered with remnants of food and drinks. They would not return the ticket price if we decided not to wait. We are senior citizens and had to face a 3 hour delayed flight from SYD to MEL. We asked the reason for delay, they asked for our boarding passes, took down numbers and gave them back. When the flight was boarding, our boarding passes were taken away from us and new ones issued. They had row 30 on them. We could not believe it. We were told by the young woman at boarding desk that those places are better than the row 15 we had paid for, as the boarding and exit are quicker. No amount of reasoning could move her. The plane was full, there was no question of redistribution of weight. Fortunately, the cabin staff were more understanding, and as our health condition is not ideal, we got back our original seats which were empty anyway. But the experience spoiled our flight which was otherwise quite smooth.

### Tigerair Australia customer review
My 4pm flight from Melbourne to Adelaide was cancelled - due to a number of other delays throughout the day. The next available flight with Tigerair was 24 hrs later - which would have been fine if we didn't need to be in Adelaide the next morning! We found the staff very unhelpful - in fact they had a deadpan face whilst giving us this news. There was no apology. There was no attempt to find another alternative route by the airline. I just found them really unsympathetic. I understand that they probably had to deal with many irate customers prior to telling me this new s- but this is just not good enough. We ended up cancelling our tickets and getting our tickets on credit and made plans with Jetstar.

### Tigerair Australia customer review
Brisbane to Adelaide on TT317 departed 4.50pm (local) arrived 6.50pm (local). Yes they police and enforce the carry-on limit but it works and allows for quick turnarounds. I took advantage of their new cabin+ which allowed me to bring on board up to 12kg. As I had pre-booked an exit row seat I had to counter check-in rather than use the self-serve kiosks but there was no waiting and quickly processed by friendly staff. At the gate, carry-on bags were being checked ad-hoc. Boarding was efficient and quick which allowed for an early departure. The aircraft was spotless and it was great to have cloth seats rather than the faux leather of Virgin. Yes its buy on board, but a good range of drinks and snacks were available. Very friendly cabin crew and great communication from the flight deck. It was actually the first time that I was asked if I needed assistance to place my bag in the overhead locker. Seat comfort no different to economy on Qantas, Virgin or Jetstar and in fact it seemed that the seats were wider than on the Qantas and Virgin 737's. Since being taken over by Virgin, Tiger certainly seemed to have improved and as long as you follow the rules concerning check in times and carry-on limits they provide quality safe air travel at quite reasonable prices when compared with Virgin and Qantas. You have to ask for the majority of flights in Australia under 3 hours, is the extra money to fly Qantas or Virgin for a complimentary muffin worth it. While Tiger only operate limited flights to/from Adelaide compared to Qantas and Virgin, I will certainly be happy to look at flying Tiger again if the price and flight times work.

### Tigerair Australia customer review
MEL-HBA, turbulent flight and stressful because it was so cramped due to the need to put luggage in front-overheads space stolen! HBA-MEL flight much better. Tiger staff overall very friendly. Flights always good enough when there's not too many passengers. Comfort/assurance-wise nothing like Qantas, but for flights less than 2 hr Tiger is a very good option - best being the seat pitch is actually bigger than all other Aussie domestic flights.

### Tigerair Australia customer review
Tigerair seems to be very strict on carry on luggage weight of 7kg per person. I flew from Melbourne to Sydney in end of May and the ground crew actually made some of the passengers to take off their coats in the winter to weight the coat on top of the luggage to make sure it won't pass 7kg limit. I know this is a budget airline but I find it hard to believe that we had to take off coats and sweaters in the cold weather so they can weight it. Very bad impression on Tigerair. My previous good experience with the airline is totally gone now.

### Tigerair Australia customer review
We flew BNE-MEL-BNE with an infant After reading all these reviews I was worried. No need to worry at all followed the rules was at the airport on time they did not weigh our cabin baggage they gave us an extra seat as the plane was not full. The staff were very kind to all parents with infants. Plane left and arrived on time both ways would fly them again.

### Tigerair Australia customer review
Today (1/5/2015) I was boarding a flight from Brisbane to Melbourne. Everyone was kind and the service was good. However upon boarding the aircraft we were informed by the pilot that one of the engines was not starting. We were on the tarmac unable to move for 2 hours before the pilot told us was had to leave the aircraft and other arrangements would be made. After a 9 hour delay with nothing given to us but 'complementary water' we were finally put on another aircraft no help whatsoever from the crew to get a different earlier flight. The one thing I do applaud this terrible airline is the fact that they were able to spot the engine failure whilst still on the ground and not whilst we were mid-flight. I would never fly Tiger again and would never recommend it to anyone I know. They need to step up their game a routine 2 hour flight turned into an 11 hour ordeal.

### Tigerair Australia customer review
I traveled on Flight 218 from Melbourne to Sydney. The check in process went smoothly and the agent that assisted me was very friendly and that helped set the tone for a flight that was supposed to have been short and without incident. The flight was supposed to have been less than 90 minutes. I found out that Sydney Airport had closed due to inclement weather and that the fuel was low so the flight was diverted to Canberra. Absolutely no information was provided by the pilots or the cabin crew in Canberra as to when the flight would be back in the air or how long the ground delay would be for. I had told the cabin crew that I had to connect to an international flight and tried outlining steps that they could take such as requesting priority disembarkation/luggage collection and calling their ground reps in Sydney to see if assistance could be provided at the arrival gate for those that were traveling on connecting flights. Their response to me was "we understand and we'll do everything we can to help". After sitting in Canberra for well over 2 hours it became clear that I faced the very real possibility that I would miss my connecting flight. When the plane did land in Sydney I was left with a little over an hour to disembark run to baggage claim to get my luggage and transfer terminals in order to make my international connection. The flight did not arrive at a bridged gate. Instead passengers had to disembark by stairs and proceed up a single set of stairs into the concourse - I was sitting at the rear of the plane so you imagine what it's like walking behind more than a 100 other people because that's what happened to me. I was appalled upon getting to the concourse to find out that not a single Tigerair representative was around to meet the aircraft and offer help. In spite of me having clearly told the cabin crew that I was supposed to connect to an international flight and in spite of providing them with my departure time my luggage was one of the very last pieces to be removed from the plane. I then had to run to the train to the international terminal which I had to pay for and once there I ran straight for the Etihad Airways check in desk only to be told that the flight had already been closed and that it would not be possible to board. I had to watch the plane that was supposed to have brought me home push back and leave without me. I can understand that diversions and other unexpected circumstances can happen from time to time but after having been given the run-around after having been offered no legitimate help of any kind on the ground upon arrival in Sydney and after dealing with a flight crew that didn't have the least bit of sympathy for my situation and offered generic explanations instead of going out of their way to truly help me out I can assuredly say that I will never fly with Tigerair again!

### Tigerair Australia customer review
I travelled back from Sydney to Adelaide April 16 2015 with my hubby and 3 kids. I've got a High Functioning 15 yrs old son who was seated next to me and went to use the toilet in the middle of the flight (no turbulence that time) he normally does not want to use public toilets he came back to his seat and told me he had not used the toilet I said I would go with him and I waited outside. I was approach by a flight attendant who told me to use the other toilet at the back of the plane. I tried to explain to her that I was waiting for my son but in a loud voice she told me she wanted me to return to my seat. She did not give me a chance to say anything. I will never fly with Tigerair again.

I travelled to Darwin last Wednesday night and returned to Brisbane on the red eye flight this morning. The crew on both flights were excellent they were so helpful and went out of their way to help me. I am a mature age lady who required assistance in both directions and have flown with many airlines I can say this airline is number one and will be the only airline I fly with in the future.

### Tigerair Australia customer review
Booked three Tigerair flights two were reasonably on time one was 5 hours late due to being wheeled out from the terminal twice and taken back due to computer fault. Then when finally in the air we were turned back to Sydney as our destination Cairns did not have the facilities to mend the aircraft completely for the return the journey we only had 4 days in Cairns so were not too happy at missing half a day stuck in Sydney airport no refreshments of any kind were offered.

Flew Brisbane to Darwin 22nd Dec 2014. Cost was cheap plane was new and staff were really friendly. Departed and arrived on time. Bought some food and drinks and thought the quality and price was good. Will definitely fly with them again.

### Tigerair Australia customer review
I flew from Brisbane to Sydney yesterday (25/1/15) flight was fine but the overweight luggage cost was over the top not only that they also weigh your handbag along with your luggage bag. I don't mind paying if it was excessively overweight but it was 2kg's over and the charge was $82. If you were to fly Jetstar their charge is $30.

### Tigerair Australia customer review
I regularly fly from the Gold Coast to Sydney and return. I choose to fly with Tiger as they are cheap and no frills. However when you purchase your ticket or tickets via the Tiger Airways official website it asks if you would like to choose your seat and some seats with more "leg room" cost more. On the seat selection page it shows which seats are empty and which seats are booked. Generally the seats with the added leg room are an extra cost and generally always the first booked. I always skip the seat selection and let Tiger assign me a seat at no extra cost. Now whenever I go to check in at Sydney airport or Coolangatta airport the check in staff often ask me where I would like to sit. So I ask for the seats with extra leg room which are the emergency exit rows and generally I'm assigned a seat with extra leg room despite the fact that I didn't pay anything extra and despite the Tiger Airways website stating that those seats which cost more and were "booked". So some poor fools are specifically choosing a certain seat and paying extra on the Tiger airways official website for a seat with extra "leg room". Yet I'm not paying anything extra for my seat and I'm offered the choice to sit in a seat which was shown as "booked" on the Tiger Airways website. I have to admit that I don't always get the choice to sit in a seat which costs extra on the tiger airways website but I find if I check in early enough then roughly 80% of the time the check in staff will give me the choice to sit anywhere at no extra cost. Despite other people paying for the choice to choose their own seat. I recommend Tiger Airways for short flights only as there is no inflight entertainment.

### Tigerair Australia customer review
Melbourne to Adelaide terrible terminal. Seen better terminals in 3rd world countries. Walked for at least 10 minutes along container style construction in 30 degree heat to plane then onto tarmac. Plane flight and service to industry standard. Return trip Adelaide to Melbourne check in time is 45 minutes industry standard is 30 minutes. Could not check in 40 minutes prior to flight went to boarding gate and could not board the flight departure even though I had my seat allocation via email while passengers where boarding my flight I was told can't help you sorry. First and last flight with Tiger.

### Tigerair Australia customer review
MEL-SYD TT228. Having not flown Tiger over the last few years I was very pleased to be able to fly with them again. Cheap airfare even with the add-ons was still cheaper than Jetstar. Friendly check in staff. The Tiger Terminal is basic but serves its purpose. Boarding was very prompt and the flight took off on time. Very engaging cabin crew. Very smooth flight. Landed early into Sydney. All in all a very positive experience on Tiger and would prefer them over Jetstar.

Flew TT676 Sydney to Cairns Oct 20/14. Carrying a sleeping child the ruthless attendant onboard ordered me to present my boarding pass before putting my child down in an empty seat to present it. After explaining she had the nerve to call me rude. Terrible customer service.

Will certainly fly with them again. We've done Melbourne to Perth return with a 2 and 3 year old. Check in was easy boarding was easy flights were on time. Staff were attentive and polite. We honestly couldn't fault them as a budget airline and will fly again.

### Tigerair Australia customer review
We were booked on return flights from Melbourne to Brisbane (25 Oct to 1 Nov 2014) and had to cancel our flights two weeks before because the airline would not allow us to take our daughter's BiPAP on board which she needs with her at all times due to an inability to breath on her own while sleeping. We provided a medical certificate to confirm this and despite repeated calls with them to try and convince them that her ventilator does not use supplemental oxygen they would still not allow us to take it on board (nor bring it as checked luggage). We have flown previously with many other airlines and never had this problem before.

Flew DRW to BNE (27/9/14) and BNE to DRW (4/10/14). Both flights were good. Comfortable throughout the journey. Zero issues. Excellent staff. Check-in/Baggage Drop at DRW ground had minor issue since only one counter was operating resulting in long queue but was quickly resolved. For the price that I paid I'll travel with Tigerair again no doubt. Not that calculative when it comes to baggage too.

We were standing in line at the airport waiting to check in 2 hours before the flight due to a disabled child travelling and I received a text telling me our flight was cancelled due to weather.

TT253 MEL-SYD and back last week. Very lucky to be able fly at this price. Although not as non-bumpy as Qantas flights the servicing was decent. Discomfort was caused (usually anyway) by other passengers - in that case talking loudly. On the way back it was reclining when it's only a domestic flight! Special mention this time I flew: I left my headphones on the plane calls to the Tigerair service center were promptly answered. The address to the lost property office provided was correct and they responded even at midnight! Very polite and kind. Got my headphones back the next day. The T4 improvements - so much better than last year- not bad to travel on them from Melbourne now.

Travelled SYD-OOL. Flying from SYD-OOL the flight took off 25 minutes later than expected. Luggage did not make the flight was given the option to wait have it delivered the following day or to come collect it the following day our self. We decided to wait as we were told it was on another flight that was due to land within 45mins and we needed things from our suitcase that night. We waited over 2 hours for our luggage. During the wait we were told we would receive vouchers for some food/coffee. The vouchers were valued at $5 but this late at night no restaurants were serving main meals anymore. When we checked in to this flight  we paid extra to choose our selected seats. When we checked in we were told that we would not be sitting together we showed our receipt which had our seat numbers on it but that was completely ignored. Flight from OOL-SYD was due for take off at 12.30 pm did not leave until around 1.10-1.15 pm. On the return flight my chair did not recline this seat was broken. Will never fly with Tiger again. It is definitely worth paying extra money for a better company.

TR 2428 SIN-PEN 31 August. This airline is a mixed bag. Flight wise boarding was very organised (passengers were boarded by row numbers) and no complaints about the service of the crew on this flight. Aircraft departed the gate in Singapore a couple of minutes late but arrived early in Penang. That being said the ground and online services are completely lacking. A total mess at Changi T2 at 7.30am in the morning with hundreds of passengers scrambling to check in for 5-6 flights at the time. The airline does not spend any effort to guide passengers to the correct check in queues but is more than happy to deploy staff to collect passenger information for their own surveys. No self-check machines whatsoever. The online service is no better: passengers departing Singapore on one-way tickets have no online check in option and hence no straight to gate to beat the queues. I wish I could recommend people to fly this airline but no. Don't fly Tigerair unless you don't have any other option.

Flew Melbourne - Sydney (TT282) on Friday 1st August. Due to take off at 21.05 and arrive 22.30. Flight delayed by 40 mins due to poor weather. Eventually took off and flew to Sydney only to be informed we couldn't land as we'd missed the Sydney airport curfew. Arrived back in Melbourne at Midnight. Tiger staff didn't show and left the ground subcontractor to sort out the mess. No accommodation or compensation provided apart from the promise of credit note which could take 4 weeks to arrive. Those still wishing to fly on Saturday morning had to fight over the last 25 seats available failing that wait until Sunday (40 seats available) or Monday (70 seats). Spent the night on floor in airport and booked a replacement flight with Virgin for 7am to fly out. Will never fly with them again. Total lack of customer support or service.

### Tigerair Australia customer review
Melbourne-Gold Coast return never flown Tiger before so was a little unsure what to expect after hearing so many mixed reviews over the past few years. We were pleasantly surprised however flight from Melbourne was on-time with friendly attentive crew plenty of in-flight announcements and our pre-paid food was delivered promptly. Return flight was delayed due to bad weather in Sydney which they made us aware of and unavoidable and we were half an hour late arriving back into Melbourne from the Gold Coast due to a thunderstorm over Tullamarine once again can't blame Tiger for that. The Tiger terminal is a little rudimentary and very cold in Melbourne winter so hope they get that sorted but overall we had no problem with Tiger whatsoever for the price we paid and would happily fly with them again.

### Tigerair Australia customer review
Flew on 11th April 2014 from Adelaide to Brisbane. When approaching check in staff very helpful and happy. We purchased an extra on our ticket which was the cost of $3.00 to have priority boarding. Initially thought was ' that's great! When it was time for boarding they called out over the speaker that all passengers that have purchased priority boarding to board now. It seemed a bit confusing because when we went to go and stand in line everyone got out of there seats to board the plane. Luckily me and my brother got to the boarding gate to stand in line first but even when we did get our boarding passes scanned people behind us without priority boarding were allowed to board. I think Tigerair need to be specific and say a couple of times more calling for anyone with priority boarding. Once boarding the flight the cabin crew were so polite and welcoming. There were plenty of drinks and food to purchase the trolley was full! The food was fresh and the drinks were nice and cold. I'm incredibly satisfied with my experience with Tigerair and I'm flying with them again in a month.

We flew Sydney to Proserpine and return and left us feeling very happy and satisfied with the complete package. Check in staff at both Sydney and Proserpine were both polite and seemed happy in their jobs. The boarding procedures were without issue and the aircraft's were both well presented and on the return trip the newest aircraft in the fleet had that nice "new plane smell" about it. The flights left and arrived on time. The seating was adequate not overly roomy but ok. The leather upholstery on the return flight was welcome. The inflight catering is user pays as is usual with all low cost carriers and a good variety was available and to my knowledge was all available. We purchased 2 hot chocolate drinks at $4 each which was reasonable value. The cabin staff were attentive and had good customer skills . The main reason airlines employ cabin staff is to facilitate safety and the cabin staff on both sectors were very particular with their safety briefings and walk around checks. On arrival at Sydney we were directed to a remote parking stand. This presented no problems as the bus transport dropped the pax off literally within 20 metres of the baggage claim carousel. One passenger mislaid his mobile phone on the aircraft  the cabin staff located it and it was in his custody before the bus reached the terminal all with a smile. Great customer service. We will certainly consider Tigerair next time.

Melbourne to Cairns 7th July. 12 hour delay due to a bird strike. Exactly one week to the day we are currently grounded at Cairns for at least 6 hours due to a bird strike. Call me cynical but how coincidental is that. Just an excuse used by Tigerair me thinks. Will never fly with them again and I don't recommend you using them either.

### Tigerair Australia customer review
Does the catering exist? Flew MEL-BNE check in easy - no queue. Check in person at bag drop offered us exit row seats which were gratefully accepted. But when the food service commenced they advised they had 'ran out'. MEL is a base - how can they not have food at the start of a flight departing MEL? Flight delayed due to a broken Jetstar plane and only one runway but captain kept passengers informed. See my earlier review about lack of catering out of PER - bit of a theme!

Sunshine Coast-Melbourne return. Flights down and back left on time. The flight to Melbourne was over the lunch period and they had no meals or sandwiches left. We had anticipated being able to have lunch on board so didn't eat prior. Needless to say we arrived in Melbourne rather hungry. The flight back was great as we were upgraded to exit row seats free of charge. Overall you get what you pay for. Tigerair met my expectations and I would certainly fly with them again.

### Tigerair Australia customer review
Never again! Our flight from the Gold Coast to Melbourne was cancelled last weekend with 2 hours notice. We received notification via an sms. We phoned the airline who did not at the time offer us an alternate flight so we booked another flight that day with Jetstar. When we arrived at the airport we asked for an explanation at the Tigerair counter. We were told we could fly later that day from Brisbane or the next day from the Gold Coast but this had not been offered to us earlier and we had made alternate arrangements and paid premium prices for tickets. There seems to be a complete lack of regard for peoples circumstances and inconvenience resulting from cancelled flights. We will never again fly with them.

Sydney-Cairns return 24-28/06. We found the seats a bit cramped up to Cairns so elected to go for extra legroom for the return leg. I tried to change these online but was unable to do so. The following day we popped into the airport to go to the ticket office but found that there wasn't one. so I approached the check-in manager and explained the problem. Not only did we get the seats we wanted but the upgrade was free by way of an apology. This was most impressive customer service! Outbound flight was on time inbound left 30 minutes late but due to very strong tailwinds we recovered most of the time en route. Ignore the IFE rating - there was none.

We have flown Tigerair numerous times in the past few years between Brisbane and Melbourne with few problems until Thursday 29th May when they left Brisbane 2.5 hours late. We were fortunate we didn't have anyone waiting and the FAPAS bus still happily honoured our ticket. Then returning on Monday 2nd from Melbourne our flight which was due to leave 12.20pm eventually took off at 17.05pm arriving in Brisbane too late for us to get our connecting transport home until Tuesday morning. They announced several times that due to the late arrival of our plane our flight would be leaving late which didn't ring true. A later flight took off hours before ours. They eventually gave all passengers a $5 refreshment voucher but this hardly makes up for sitting in the airport for 6 hours with only several announcements.

Travelled Prosperine-Sydney Sydney-Melbourne on Saturday 31 May. Due to late arrival of plane in Prosperine by the time flight arrived at Sydney I was too late to collect baggage and re-check in. Ground staff and flight attendants could not have been more helpful polite and concerned. I collected my bag and when I realised check- in was closed I went to the gate and the ground staff checked my bag in at the gate and had it placed in the hold. Excellent service and the best bit Tigerair now have a gluten free meal option. Jetstar and Virgin could learn something from Tiger re food options for those with food intolerance's.

Got to airport just to find out they had decided to cancel flight excuse given was flight was delayed for too long even though 2 more flights flew out after ours. Offered no accommodation and told refund would take 6 weeks this is the second time this has happened within a month on same route Gold coast to Sydney at 8pm.

The last 2 years we have flown 2617 up from Perth to Singapore. Its a budget airline and with that you get the budget things. Flights always on time with no delays. Its 5 hours so if you have sore backs and a big man like me you are prob going to be a little uncomfortable. But hey its that or another grand more on SQ.

Tigerair economy MEL to MCY and return. On the infrequent times I have flown with this airline I have found them never less than satisfactory. For the price they represent good value for money against any of the other budget or full service airlines. On this occasion the seating configuration was tight but the cost was just over half of what Qantas would have charged. Both flights were on time for take off and arrival at destination.

### Tigerair Australia customer review
PER-MEL. For the price I guess I was overall happy with the experience. However for a 1745 departure and a 3.5 hour flight I was disappointed to discover they had no fresh food onboard during a dinner time flight. Admittedly the plane had just landed from MEL and Tigerair has no base in Perth but no fresh food! I had to settle for Pringles and nuts. Plus T2 at Perth is a shiny shed where most things had shut down before departure - the bar and the newsagent were both shut. I wasn't really in the mood for Subway and had expected at least a sandwich and a wine on board. Cabin crew mostly indifferent though.

We travelled From Sydney to Melbourne return On 17 May and and were pleasantly surprised. I used the Online Checkin and also printed our boarding passes. The site was available for check in 2-3 days prior to the flight thus all we had to do was walk in through gates and board. The A320 aircraft were clean and modern. The only minor issue with myself was that the seat headrests were a little high so basically our field of vision was restricted. The inflight announcements were very good. The airfares are very reasonable the flight was very quiet and everybody was greeted with respect.

Brisbane to Sydney on the 4th May on TT377 which was scheduled to depart at 3:55pm. There were delays in Sydney due to winds and all airlines were suffering delays to/from Sydney. Hardly Tigers fault. Boarded the plane around 4:40pm and was ready for take off just after 5pm. Most people were asleep after a busy weekend as we started rolling down the runway. About 1/3 of the way down the runway the captain hit the brakes. We were stopped at the end of the runway and had no idea why. There was no announcement from the cabin crew and eventually the captain came on. A light had appeared during takeoff and he had to abort the takeoff. So he said we'd go back to the terminal and have engineers look at the issue and we were to remain on the plane. The cabin crew made no announcements at all during this time. One got short when people wanted to go the toilet. After about 10 mins we were told we would need to get off and head back into the terminal. Back into the terminal we go and we were told not to go too far so we can listen to the announcements. What announcements?? There was not 1 announcement from the Aerocare ground staff. The captain made two announcements over the nearly 5 hour delay! One of the announcements was that the engineer had just arrived at that was at 7pm nearly 2 hours later and that we should be out by 8pm. Then 8pm came and no announcement. The staff at the gate said a call would be made between 8:30pm and 9pm to see if the flight would be cancelled. Come 9pm there was no announcement! With a delay this long peoples tempers were becoming frayed! The AFP turned up a few times. We received no food or drink vouchers. We also learnt that if the flight was cancelled it was left up to us to find accommodation. The 8:05pm flight to Sydney was cancelled as it was the same aircraft that we were on. There was some very lost passengers at the gate as there was no staff at the gate. We finally boarded around 9:20pm and we didn't get off the ground till 9:45pm. All we got onboard as compensation was a cup of tea or coffee or a cup of water! We made it to Sydney with 6 mins to spare before curfew. Not too sure if I'd fly Tiger again after this experience. The Aerocare staff need better training to handle these situations.

Adelaide- Melbourne return carry on baggage only check in at Adelaide less than a minute. Modern A320 aircraft clean and tidy and departed on time. Return flight 3 days later much the same as out bound though given exit seats with generous leg room at no extra charge. All in all great value for a 60 minute flight which cost less than half of other airlines. as with other budget airlines  arrive at the airport in plenty of time know the rules and regs and fly cheap.

The 8.05pm Tiger flight on the Sunday of the A-League Grand Final - Brisbane to Sydney - was cancelled and rescheduled for Tuesday 8.05! There was no assistance from staff no communication and complete contempt for passengers. I spent 23 hours waking and sleeping at Brisbane airport after changing to a Virgin flight that was also cancelled and reset for a few hours departure later than planned. Mine is one of many stories and Tiger has seen the last of me.

### Tigerair Australia customer review
Flew to Sydney - Brisbane return on the same day 5th May 2014. Flight to Brisbane was eventually about an hour and a half late but the return flight was cancelled after waiting in the check in queue for about 2 hours. The worst thing was nobody was told anything At one stage the police came along fearing trouble and they had to tell the staff to make an announcement! Zero care appalling customer service useless excuse for an airline.

### Tigerair Australia customer review
First and last flight with Tiger today. Hesitantly booked our flights about 6 weeks ago as all other airline options weren't suitable at the time paid to allocate specific seats as I'm a nervous flyer arrived at the airport 85 mins prior to departure to see an enormous queue and 3 check-in staff. A staff member eventually came forward asking for anymore passengers for Sydney (ex Cairns) we came forward with half a dozen others and were told there were 7 seats left on the flight I shrugged this off as we had already paid for our seats were early and had paid extra for the seat allocation. Things went downhill quickly. No seats together bad luck read the T&C's we were told which apparently state no matter how much you pay or how early you are you're not even guaranteed a seat let alone the one you specifically chose and paid extra for. Apparently they're in the business of intentionally over-selling all of their flights. When I protested and continued to remind her we were on time had followed all the rules and should not have had our seats given away we were told too bad further protesting miraculously eventually resulted in seats together but not the seats we'd paid for. Our bag was a couple of kilos over which was the same bag that boarded a Jetstar flight to Cairns without incident and now we were being told to pay $25 per kilo I laughed and said that's ok we can take a few things out the already rude check-in staff member continued to get ruder and ruder telling us she didn't have time for this (still an hour before the flight) and eventually let us go but only because I continued to protest. The size of the seat and legroom was by far the most cramped and uncomfortable I've ever experienced. Arrived in Sydney on time but landed in the middle of the Tarmac and had to be ferried by buses to the terminal of course not enough buses! For the stress and discomfort caused at the end of an otherwise amazing holiday saving $50 on the fare price just wasn't worth it. Neither of us will ever fly with Tiger again.

TT271 Sydney to Melbourne 24/4 - arrived at airport to see cancelled on airport monitors. No information nothing. Wait in queue for an hour to be offered refund or flight tomorrow "sometime". Great start to long weekend. Flew last flight at night with Qantas instead - at great cost. TT214 Melbourne to Sydney 28/4. Arrived at airport - flight not even on monitor. No information. Cancelled! Join huge queue confusion reigns by time we get to front 90 minutes later (only one staff member processing flights for first hour in queue) they are offering Virgin fight 6hrs later. Flew Qantas instead - again at great cost. Will I fly Tiger again? What do you think!

I was booked to fly from Sydney to Melbourne on 27 April standing in check-in lane two check-in staff got up closed their counter and walked off. Instantaneously a text message arrived saying flight cancelled. No assistance to get to a new flight nothing. Worst customer service ever.

### Tigerair Australia customer review
I was a couple of kilos over but within size limit of carry on luggage and charged $75 dollars to check it in. I was told I could wear enough articles in my bag to reduce the weight though this does not reduce the weight of me and my bag in the cabin. Then my bag doesn't catch the same plane as me. Ground crew told me "for some reason your bag didn't make the flight". I also wouldn't be getting it until the next day. I had enough meds for the flight but had left the bulk of my meds in the bag. The service and the lack of humanity within the staff as a result of training to standby ridiculous nonsensical rules.

### Tigerair Australia customer review
Not worth saving a few dollars. Bought tickets from Sydney to Brisbane connecting from an international flight with more time that suggested by the airlines with connections. When we arrived at the Tiger check-in the line was long and desk understaffed and by the time we reached a rep it was 42 minutes until departure thus we were told our tickets were worthless. Rules are rules but the rep had no interest in helping us and even informed us that we could buy another full fare Tiger ticket to fly a nearby city. We gave up walked 50 feet to Virgin Australia and were treated as if we were long time customers - even rushed onto a flight that departed before the original Tiger flight. I understand that airlines have rules for reasons but part of flying is the service and at Tiger there is none whatsoever. I recommend not flying with this airline.

### Tigerair Australia customer review
I flew on April 4 Brisbane - Melbourne and again April 6 MEL-BNE. Initially I was hesitant on flying with them due to their previously bad rep however after the weekend I am very likely to book with them again due to their cheap fares. Arriving 45 mins before is mandatory as the check-in closes immediately 45 mins prior to take off. I arrived 1.5 hours early to be sure and that was plenty of time. The plane took off on time and landed on time- all I required. Staff are friendly. Seats are smaller than other airlines which may be a problem for some people. Flying in and out of Melbourne means T4 which is a smaller terminal just south of Tullamarine's T1 T2 and T3. This wasn't a problem as well signed and I was aware however may be problematic if you have not planned ahead. I would suggest flying Tiger. Just be on time.

### Tigerair Australia customer review
I couldn't be more unhappy with the customer service at Tigerair. Every time I have flown with them has been quite simply awful. My most recent experience was flying out of Sydney to Brisbane. All trains to the domestic and international airports were delayed due to a medical emergency so I scrambled to get a taxi to the airport arriving 40 minutes before my flight's departure. Weather was terrible in Sydney most flights were delayed. I was told very curtly that I had missed my flight and there was nothing to be done. After an hour of trying to speak to a supervisor to make a complaint I was told nothing could be done - no refund no credit nothing. Ridiculous uncompromising and terrible customer service.

### Tigerair Australia customer review
I convinced my family to fly tiger (Melbourne - Sydney return) as the flights were cheaper. I now know why. A text from Tiger to say that our flight had been delayed 4 hours. This dragged out to 5 hours. This is a short hop to Melbourne. I've learnt now I will pay my $50 extra next time for decent airline.

### Tigerair Australia customer review
ADL-MEL return. Check-in online printed boarding passes so only had to get to the gate by boarding time. (30 minutes before departure). Aircraft fairly new A320s in not so bad shape clean and tidy contents of the seatback pocket in a pretty worn state. Crew friendly and efficient decent food and drink selection for an as to be expected price. Thorough communication from the flight deck. Both flights departed and arrived on time. The only drawback about flying with Tigerair to Melbourne is the horrible T4 Terminal that they use although it is in the process of being redeveloped. And for the price of their airfares you can't really complain. Another positive experience flying with Tigerair and will fly with them again if the price is right.

### Tigerair Australia customer review
SYD-MEL-SYD. This is about the tenth flight I have had with Tiger and they continue to impress. Sure you get no entertainment no free food and no leg room but with flights as cheap as this I can put up with it. They are yet to cancel a flight on me which is more than I can say for some 4 star airlines I have flown. Would recommend them for short flights. I am flying Sydney-Perth next week will let you know how that goes.

Booked morning flight from Adelaide to Melbourne waiting to check in and were informed flight had been cancelled no other flight available until later that evening. Later told mechanical fault as the cause for cancellation. Ended up having to pay more for a flight with Jetstar. Poor service and reliability.

Flew from Melbourne to Alice Springs. Check in was quick went straight through security at Tigers own terminal. Boarding was on time and and the flight left on time. The staff were polite friendly and efficient. At Melbourne you avoid the crowding since Tiger have their own terminal. Myself and my family have now flown Tiger several times and the experience has been consistent.

7th Feb. We were booked on the 6.45pm Sydney to Brisbane to visit our grandchildren. We arrived at the check in at 6.00 pm with 11 other passengers and whilst queuing to check in the Tiger employees smiled sweetly and put up the flight closed signs and walked away. Couldn't care less about the people waiting to check in. We all went down to the Departure gate to be met by the most arrogant supervisor who would not let us board the flight nor would he give any reason. He told us to ring customer service pay $85 and we could fly the next afternoon. We phoned customer service who were equally unhelpful and the fares had suddenly escalated to $112.00. Fortunately for us our son booked us on a Qantas flight the next day. We will never fly Tiger again.

My wife and were supposed to fly Tiger from Sydney to Perth on 3rd Feb 2014 at 21.55 we arrived 3 hours early for the flight as we connected from NZ checked in and then advised plane would be leaving at 22.25. We boarded ok and taxied out on to the runway. We were out there for what seemed to be an eternity. Then Plane came back to the terminal. Informed by pilot that Sydney has a curfew and no plane in or out between 11pm and 6am. Very poor for a major Domestic/international airport. Pilot also said there was only one runway allocated to Tiger and the wind was blowing in the wrong direction to take off. We then were told on disembarking that Tiger would offer a new flight at 6am the next morning. No offer of accommodation no meal or drink vouchers no water nothing. Staff were extremely unhelpful and unsympathetic. We were told to come back at 4 am the next morning to check in no staff were there until 4.15am. We finally got to the end of the queue and expected to have seats 9D and 9E that we paid for and were told they were given to someone else the check in girl told me "have you read your terms and conditions no seat is guaranteed" and eventually got seats down the back. Plane was supposed to leave at 6am another delay and eventually left at 8am. Sydney airport and tiger definitely need to lift their game. I will never fly Tiger again worst customer service by an airline I have received.

### Tigerair Australia customer review
We flew with Tiger Sydney to Alice Springs return three times in 2013 and found them to be fine. I was making a documentary and needed to get 4 crew members and 13 equipment road cases there and back and the very cheap fare (about 1/4 the cost of another carrier) enabled us to do just that. Aircraft cabin was fine clean and presentable and departure-arrival times went to schedule. We had no problems with cabin crew as all were approachable and communicative. I did see people at Sydney turn up late and also try to wing it with baggage allowances and they had to pay the price for this which is fair enough. I suspect that not everyone has the same experience with them but I can only recount mine and so far they have been worth flying with unlike some other Australian airlines who have lost the plot with cabin service.

A320-232's (VH-VNC) from Melbourne to Cairns on TT462. Aircraft was the first to take on the rebrand from Tiger Airways to Tigerair. It had brand new very comfortable seats and a very friendly and helpful cabin-crew. This is the 3rd time I've flown with Tigerair Australia and for a budget carrier I have been unable to fault them so far!

### Tigerair Australia customer review
Flew Perth to Melbourne and return 12th December on Airbus A320. Plane clean and seats comfortable, arrived on time. Very impressed with Tiger pilots and staff. Typical budget no frills airline but exceptional value for money. Only downside was the sparse terminal lounge and long walk to bus port but this is politics talking where a budget airline is concerned. Would fly Tiger again when next in Perth.

### Tigerair Australia customer review
I had a flight from the Gold Coast to Sydney. Instead of warning people of a cancellation the airline delayed the flight for 3 hours until 10 pm. The flight was cancelled 3 hours after departure time. They then told people to collect their baggage and receive further information. They then informed us that there would be a flight the following day and there would be no compensation for the flight or hotels. The only thing they did was give us a scrap of paper with a list of hotels all of which had no availability. There were children and families with no place to sleep. The next day absolutely no sympathy or apologies were shown and they even tried to charge us extra for baggage between 2 people that was 21 kg. After this we arrived at the gate to see no airplane in sight with no information on when the flight would arrive. Our second flight to Sydney ended up being delayed 2.5 hours. For the amount we saved it is an extremely risky airline to fly with.

Melbourne to Sydney on 30 December 2013. Arrived at Tiger at 10am waste time of 5 hours as they cancelled our flight TT508 12.30pm from Melbourne to Sydney delayed later flight at 2.50pm and wasted our taxi booking at Sydney airport for 2.05pm. We arrived Sydney at 4pm. We had been told the plane was held back in Brisbane due to thunderstorms the night before so the plane couldn't reach to Melbourne

Rescheduled our families flights from Coffs Harbour to Melbourne and they didn't even meet up! Then refused refund had to book a Jetstar flight Melbourne to Sydney at 0800 on New years day to meet our Tiger connection. On the way down the plane was 1 hour late and they reluctantly rescheduled us to arrive in Melbourne at 11.00 at night charging us $255.00 for the privilege even though it was their fault! Originally they had suggested we stay overnight at the airport! Angry and dissatisfied. Ended up costing more than if I had booked with a reputable airline.

Very bad service and extreme delays they cancelled our flight TT506 from Melbourne to Sydney on 30 December 2013 without any prior notice rescheduled us on a later flight at 12.50pm which was later delayed until 2.25pm while keeping the passengers completely in the dark facing rude and uncooperative staff. I will never fly on this airline again. Note: the price of the ticket was not even cheap it cost AUD250 for a return ticket from Melbourne to Sydney.

Arrived 30 seconds late for flight to Melbourne from Perth check-in was closed and they weren't even there to handle any customers that walked up I had to speak to them from the gate. After pleading to let me on they didn't budge at all. Only travelling with hand luggage they told me to wait at the counter and after the flight is gone they would rebook me on the next available flight for $85. I will never book another flight with Tiger. My flight also left 10 mins late. Even a budget airline should care about it's customers we always have a choice.

### Tigerair Australia customer review
Never again will I fly with Tigerair. I've flown with them three times now and only once did they weigh my carry on. I had to throw out half of the things in my bag and put on the majority of my clothes to avoid a $90 charge. They then threatened to deny me boarding if I tried to take off any of my 8 pairs of clothes I had on and put them back in my bag. They were not just rude to me but the majority of the people checking in. They are definitely lacking in customer service. I missed a different flight with them and had to pay $85 to catch the next flight. Charging a fee to switch a flight is expected but I only paid $68 for the ticket so $85 to switch was a little steep. The plane was not comfortable and on one of my flights the power on the plane went out when we landed. Not a comforting thing to happen.

Mackay to Melbourne. 2nd November Flight TT383. Fantastic airline smooth transition refused to go back with Jetstar because of a bumpy experience and noisy aircraft with Jetstar.

My husband was meant to fly down to Melbourne to join me today for a 'cheap' weekend away. After taking half a day off work to travel to Sydney for the flight he was told upon arrival that the flight was cancelled and there was not another flight available until the following morning. The staff said they sent a text and email on the day of departure advising of the cancellation - neither of which was received! A cheap weekend has now become a lonely weekend as we could not afford the extra $200 that a last minute flight with another airline would have cost. The staff were not at all apologetic. A sorry would have helped a bit but the attitude was tough luck - you chose Tiger. I will never fly Tiger again.

### Tigerair Australia customer review
HBA-MEL. On arrival at the airport there was no queue at check in. Offered emergency exit row which was gratefully appreciated. Advised at check in that it was expected to be a 15 minute delay which turned out to be 6 minutes in the end (Jetstar on the other hand was running about 90 min late per flight that night). Service on board was great staff were friendly. Comfy seats and a great new menu.

### Tigerair Australia customer review
I took family to Cairns from Sydney It was the first time I have flown Tiger. I paid extra to choose a particular seat so I could get extra legroom on the 3 hour flight. I booked 2 seats each way and paid an extra $100 for the privilege. Out of Sydney I did not check my seat until I got into the plane. Of course we were not given the seats we had paid for. I raised this with the cabin staff and was told that they could do nothing about it. After a lovely holiday I checked in for the return flight and raised the issue of the seats. I was told that I could not have the seats because I was flying with a 14 year old who was seated behind me. Tiger knew the ages of the family yet took the $$$$. Of course they say the seat booking fee is non refundable I feel ripped off - Never again will I fly Tiger.

### Tigerair Australia customer review
Very poor service Tiger. Queued for 20 minutes in Melbourne to be told my flight to Adelaide was cancelled and I was being transferred to a Virgin flight an hour later. No email no SMS but Tiger had both details. Queued for 20 minutes at Virgin - no need to wait for Tiger to send the details through. Come back at 9am to Service Desk. Went to Service Desk at 9am 30 minutes later again finally get a boarding pass. Contacts in Adelaide very put out by the change of timing. Returning next day. All looked good. Until just before boarding was due 50-60 minute delay announced only partially due to the bad weather that came in.

### Tigerair Australia customer review
Cheap airfares. Great customer service. Flew from Brisbane to Sydney kiosk at Brisbane airport was great quick and easy - flight was on time to Sydney flew back from Sydney no kiosk so had to wait in line which was a bit of a wait. Flight was like Jetstar and Virgin Australia other than smaller seats but I saved $500 on my 1 day trip to Sydney flying with Tiger as the other airlines were at ridiculous prices. Definitely would fly again with them Staff were great. We arrived at airport 1.5hrs before flight so we would not have any problems. No problems at all.

Return flight Melbourne to Cairns as family of 4 travelling with 2 kids under 2. Bags slightly overweight at check in lady told us we had to re-pack and then do the full line up again (about 45 min). We protested (just wanted to take things out right there and then instead of lining up again with 2 babies) and whilst she was gone to look for her manager took a couple of items out into hand luggage so weight was fine. She seemed surprised at us able to do it quickly and processed us. She just followed process but it wasn't very customer orientated nor efficient as we ended up waiting for her return as did everyone else in the line up. Return flight was fully booked with the exception of 1 seat which the check-in manager strategically placed between my husband and myself so we got 3 seats for the 4 of us which made all the difference (to us as we'll as the poor person who would have been sat next to us). Staff very friendly very reasonable fares pretty much on time both ways. Baggage claim on arrival in Melbourne tough as no staff around and 2 adults + 2 babies + suitcases + hand luggage + buggy and carseat difficult to get through gates without help. Had to ask other passengers for assistance. All in all great value for money!

Flew Tiger to Melbourne arrived only a little late and then endured the most horrendous 25 minutes waiting for luggage to be unloaded. Trapped in a wire enclosed area with a one way revolving gate - any passenger who left couldn't get back in. Couldn't leave without luggage no staff at all present just a lot of shocked looking people. Never again.

First time flying on Tiger and we flew from the Sunshine coast to Melbourne return I was impressed with the contact and confirmation via email price $59.00 each way (booked 4 months earlier). Service attendants friendly nature cleanliness of the planes and departure time (only 10 minutes late both ways ). The seating is fine we were lucky to be seated in the emergency exit for the first flight snack variety and price as per normal low cost airlines I would recommend Tiger and with the option of flying from either Brisbane or the Sunshine Coast have a great advantage of finding a cheap fare to Melbourne.

### Tigerair Australia customer review
I took advantage of an early promotion and booked 6 months in advance family return tickets Melbourne-Sydney. Three weeks before the flight Tiger changed both fly out fly in times to later times thus cutting short the planned activities. The flight out was reasonably on time (late 20 mins). One day before the return flight someone phoned me and told me the flight was cancelled and I was offered either 8.45 am or 4 pm as opposed to 7.55 pm. Considering the early check-in and travel to the airport this change wasted my entire day (Monday). Adding to the fact the total cost wasn't greatly cheaper then Virgin (my mistake for not checking the taxes and fees) I know that was the last time I flew Tiger.

Delayed at MEL for half an hr for the money we paid I couldn't ask for more was value for money. Cabin crew were nice only a short trip to Hobart. Captain appeared happy. I didn't like walking out to the plane in the wind and rain but like I said you get what you pay for and was worth it. All these negative comments in relation to check in it clearly states arrive 2hrs before departure so it can't be that hard.

Flew from Melbourne to Sydney and once again Tiger Air failed. It started with 2 flight attendance who decided it would ok to argue with each other in front of us as one raised her voice to the other while the second mumbled under her breath and stomped off. After getting strapped in we were treated to a 70 minute wait with no explanation as to why we were not moving. Finally the cabin door opened and ground crew took some paperwork from the pilots and raced off back to the terminal only to wait a further 15 minutes before we could head off. Luckily for me I wasn't catching a connection flight that day as I made sure to fly the following day knowing full well what Tiger is like.

Travelled SYD-MEL-SYD flight on time nothing to complain for the price paid. Sydney staff were more courteous and friendly and approachable then Melbourne staff. Aircraft is worn out but clean. Inflight crew were presentable.

### Tigerair Australia customer review
First time to fly Tiger usually use Virgin but took up their very cheap fare from Sydney to Cairns return last week. Had to use the early 6.45am from Sydney. Pleasantly surprised how good Tiger was! Easy check in and exact on time departures. Seating ok on plane and aircrew friendly. If you follow their rules ie. 45 minutes checking in prior to departure etc it all goes well. In fact could not fault anything and will consider using them again - we do travel a lot.

MEL-SYD return. Flew with a Tiger first timer who expected the worst. Thankfully everything was excellent - relatively quick check in at MEL emergency exit row seats offered (and gratefully accepted) on time departure and early arrival. Friendly staff. Flight home exactly the same story. Much of the negative comments on here seem to be a case of people not reading any of the terms or info on website - expecting checked luggage etc when paying a small % of Virgin or Qantas fares.

Round trip from Melbourne to Sydney. Flights were on time and fast. But the airport (Melbourne T4) is terrible. But it is understandable as it's a cheap airline. The service was good just an 80 minute flight so I don't need any food or beverages. The price was a little bit higher than usual because it was during the Easter holiday. But still worth it.

### Tigerair Australia customer review
I fly PER-MEL-PER on a regular basis. I do not buy luggage pick seats and buy any food on-board. Therefore Tiger has the cheapest flight compared to any other Australian Airlines. I have not encountered any problems yet hopefully not in the future. Seat comfort on the other hand really depends on the pax around you. If the pax kept kicking your seat from behind you will feel uncomfortable. If the pax in front of you reclined their seat you will feel uncomfortable too. Since I know it is a budget airline I do not expect much from it. What I do know is that I have never encountered any problems and flights were always on time (maybe I was just too lucky).

TT595 SYD-MEL 3 April 2013. Flight departed on time and arrived in MEL early. I boarded the plane towards the end and almost couldn't find any space to store my cabin luggage since all the overhead compartments were full by then. FAs were helpful but I found them quite snappy at times especially when instructing passengers to prepare for landing. Overall good value for money and impressively punctual.

I travelled from Perth to Melbourne on TT183 on Tuesday March 19. My companion is less than 100% fit and for the first time was offered assistance. When we had collected luggage in Melbourne (after being taken to carousel in a buggy) I enquired as to where to wait for private pick up. A staff member from that flight pointed out the waiting area and carried my companions luggage across the road. All these extra courtesies were greatly appreciated.

Melbourne to Hobart. Fast check in flight left on time the only bad thing the departure lounge in Melbourne. For the price I paid who cares.

### Tigerair Australia customer review
I flew on Tiger from Gold Coast to Sydney and they were quite acceptable. The seats had more leg space than their competitors and they were well organised. For a low cost carrier they do exactly what they set out to do and the ground staff in Gold Coast were much better organised than their competitors.

Flew Sydney down to Melbourne for a day trip on 16th of February. Arrived early at 5.15am for a 6.50am departure. We were the only ones in the queue and there were 4 desks open. Given emergency exit row in Row 13. Left from the "new" Gate 41B which is down an escalator and on a bus. There was an early boarding call for those in the Emergency exit rows. Boarded the bus and then was told to sit at the back of the bus? Being an emergency exit row the legroom was fantastic! Seat was comfortable even in the middle seat. The crew did a good job and the Cabin manager had a good sense of humour! Flight was uneventful and most passengers slept. Coming home we arrived about 10 mins after check in opened and joined the short queue. Given standard seats in row 8. Not much in the Tiger Terminal so thankfully the flight was on time! Boarding was smooth this time around. The crew did a good job and not too in your face. Even though the seat pitch looked tight it wasn't too bad. Food and drinks not cheap but not that badly priced either. Tiger does need a more comprehensive menu. Left on time and again arrived 15 mins early! If you follow their rules you'll have no problems.

### Tigerair Australia customer review
SYD-MEL return. I was very happy with this service. Check in efficient friendly staff clean plane with both flights on time for $55 tickets this is great value. It seems many complaints come from not following the rules? Just turn up to the airport on time with a printout of your reservation and with only your paid luggage allowance. Simple!

### Tigerair Australia customer review
SYD-OOL and return OOL-SYD. Check in for Sydney was fast even though the line was quite large. Check in staff did a good job moving line. Aircraft departed gate early and arrived into OOL early. Had a beer on board and snack was $8 which I thought was decent. Hostesses were good and return leg had us back in Sydney 10mins early. All round for the price no complaints just read the rules and you will have no problems!

### Tigerair Australia customer review
Booked a flight from Coffs Harbour to Sydney with another flight later from Sydney to Melbourne. Have just been told that they will need to reschedule my 1st flight meaning I will miss the connecting flight. On phoning customer services to get help they have just informed me that I can change my connecting flight but they will charge me an extra $419 for the privilege! Or if I wish to cancel I would be unable to get a full refund to go elsewhere. I think it is very unlikely I will ever use them again. It was initially a good deal but I feel ripped off now!

### Tigerair Australia customer review
Flew Flight TT 565 SYD-MEL and TT 558 MEL-SYD. Both flights smooth. Ground staff great directing lines making sure no one missed check-in. Cabin crew were very capable and did a great job. A flight attendant even made sure the SkyBus didn't leave with passengers still walking to the stop. Overall for a 1 hour domestic flight Tiger was very good and very friendly. They knew what was going on. I would fly again. Plus prices are cheap.

### Tigerair Australia customer review
ADL-MEL return. Arrived quite early at Adelaide airport. Check-in was quick staff were professional. Seat was decent good enough for this short sector. Cabin crew were great very helpful with storing the luggage. Tiger arrival terminal in Melbourne however was bad and looked like a warehouse. On the return flight the check-in line was long but moved pretty quickly. Check-in staff were friendly and put us in an emergency exit row. Our flight was late by 10 minutes. Once again the cabin crew were helpful. Overall I don't mind taking them again if they're cheaper than Virgin or Jetstar.

### Tigerair Australia customer review
Arrived at Adelaide airport 1hr 5mins before our flight back to Melbourne yesterday by the time we arrived at check in they had closed up shop and there were no Tiger staff around to explain why check in had closed early. We went to boarding gate but they were very unhelpful Jetstar staff were very understanding and they managed to get us on a flight 4 hrs later. Not impressed with Tiger but serves me right for trying to get 'cheap' flights - never again.

### Tigerair Australia customer review
I had two return bookings over the Christmas period this year. Flight #1: Delayed. Flight #2: Turned up to the airport and the flight was not listed anywhere on screens no check-in staff anywhere flight appeared to be cancelled but there was no one to ask. Tried calling the call centre and waited for half an hour each time. I had to catch the flight to Melbourne so I could catch my flight to Hobart later that day I had to book a flight with another airline so I could make it on time. Spent 3.5 hours on hold only to be told that the flight had been rescheduled and that I probably wouldn't get a refund. Flight #3 - Rescheduled (fortunately they sent me an email about that one) then delayed. Flight #4 - Waited in line for half an hour to check in and get told that they've oversold the seats and we'll just have to wait until the next day. Don't put yourself through the hassle and pain!

### Tigerair Australia customer review
Brisbane-Sydney flight (TT818). Check-in was quick and efficient I was there about an hour before closing time. Flight departed 3 minutes early and arrived on time. The in-flight service was pleasant and efficient. I was surprised that no airbridge was used at either end though and the bus taking us to the terminal building in Sydney annoyingly had to wait for "traffic" for about 10 minutes.

### Tigerair Australia customer review
Flew MEL-ADE return. Only 4 check in desks open in Melbourne so was a bit of mad scramble by staff to get passengers processed. Flight left on time though. Return was a lot more smoother only slight delay. Baggage claim in Melbourne a bit like a farmers shed with portaloos! You get what you pay for. Will fly again not long haul.

### Tigerair Australia customer review
SYD-MEL with no issues carry on luggage only. On the way back our hand luggage was exactly the same but this time we had to weigh it. Put on the scales the luggage was under the limit but then we were forced to put everything we were carrying on the scales which included our jackets camera handbag and our bottled water. This brought our weight over the limit and we were forced to pay the $80 excess baggage charge. I've flown many times before and I have never had an airline tell me to put jackets handbags and bottled water on the scales. I'm willing to pay the extra $50 to fly with an airline that doesn't try to extort money from its customers.

### Tigerair Australia customer review
At check in they tell us the flight is delayed but cannot tell us how long? Its now our scheduled time for departure and the plane hasn't even arrived here at OOL. Only 2 announcements by Tiger in the last 1hr and all they say is the flight is delayed but cannot say what the issue is or how long? I decide to do some investigative work and I log into Sydney airport to see what time the plane departed there at. Turns out the status at Sydney airport shows the proceeding flight as 'boarding' meaning its already an hour and a half late leaving Sydney! Why can't the Tiger staff give us this information so at least we can put our minds at ease? People just want to know what is going on. This is just poor customer service and totally unacceptable! This is my second poor experience with Tiger.

### Tigerair Australia customer review
Tiger airways seem very disorganised and unprofessional! On my trips to/from Melbourne and Sydney I found the staff were not aware of what was going on with flights leaving passengers clueless as to whether their flight was changed cancelled or the gate number was changed! All 3 things have happened to me and as a result my flights were delayed by more than 4 hours or I was forced to spend hundreds of dollars buying tickets with other airlines. I will never book flights with them again. The 'cheap' flights are not worth the wait and/or your trip may end up costing you 3 times as much!

### Tigerair Australia customer review
Whilst on holiday in Sydney from London I booked Tiger flights. Flew Sydney to Gold Coast Oct 17th and flight was pleasant and we landed 20 mins early. Didn't pre-book a seat and was allocated an exit row seat for free. Check in at Sydney terminal was a breeze. Flight back Saturday 20th was also very pleasant. Would use them again of which I did on 3 occasion on that holiday. Great value for money and does what the box says A to B. If you want frills then stick to other full service carriers.

### Tigerair Australia customer review
Chose to fly this airline due to competitive prices. Their service was appalling. Initially our flight was delayed due to 'operational issues' further updates provided every 15 minutes advising that no further info could be provided. 2 hours later they cancelled the flight to then be told that we were booked on a flight in the morning at 8.30am. It was absolute chaos staff were rude communication was appalling. No accommodation or food drinks were provided. Fortunately we had friends to stay with however I know many passengers had to get accommodation until the morning flight. In the morning the flight was again delayed by an hour - got called to the wrong gate 3 times staff did not know whether they were coming or going.

### Tigerair Australia customer review
My family was booked on a flight SYD to MEL midday on 12 Oct. Arrived at airport and told flight was cancelled but to wait in queue (60min!) as they were booking us on later flights. Got to front of queue to be told no flights available until the next day! Asked to see a manager but check in staff (who had no extra details) were left to deal with extremely irate passengers. Having wasted an hour in the queue meant we were only able to get expensive seats left on Jetstar or find accommodation in Sydney and lose nights accommodation in Melbourne already paid for. I understand that flights can be cancelled for various reasons but the way we were dealt with at the airport was absolutely unacceptable!

### Tigerair Australia customer review
Flew PER-SIN-PER last year around x-mas and new year. Made sure to add check in baggage allowance as well as priority boarding. Waste of money in PER as airport staff do not seem to care at all but excellent option when departing SIN. Flights left and arrived on time crew was efficient and friendly. Seats nothing special a bit small for my taste. You can purchase meals on board which were quite good and not expensive. Overall excellent value for money.

### Tigerair Australia customer review
People with any sort of a schedule should avoid this airline as they're always cancelling flights and arriving late. They don't clean their cabins either. We were informed 6 hours before departure that our flight from Brisbane to Melbourne had been cancelled. It took us 2 hours on the phone with the call centre to book a flight later on the same evening. They then booked us on two different flights - one for the evening in question the other a few days later. It took another hour to convince them to fix this. The plane was about 2 hours which meant that we arrived in Melbourne after 7pm and consequently wasted an entire day. The in- flight crew were pleasant enough. The return flight was also cancelled and re-booked for earlier on in the day - meaning we lost the 2nd of our 4 day holiday in Melbourne. My seat was full of rubbish and sopping wet with alcohol - and they couldn't give me a fresh cushion instead wrapping the soiled one in a garbage bag. It was slippery and uncomfortable. Even the stewardess who helped me looked embarrassed.

### Tigerair Australia customer review
This airline is only for if you are determined to put up with delays virtually no leg room counter and gate staff that do nothing at all to assist with any problem but just stick to company policy excuses and you have a short flight to put up with it all. Its a cheap recreational airline and that's it. Look out if you are on holidays on the Gold Coast and do a bit of shopping. I didn't realise I had to buy extra baggage 4 hours beforehand online like any other airline thought I could fix this up at the counter. If I had realised you had to buy it online it would have cost me $17.95 for up to 20 kilos. Since I didn't realise that and wanted to pay at the airport the counter staff charged me $90 (more than the cost of my ticket for the flight!) to check in 14 kilos (carry on you can only have 10 kilos). The counter staff couldn't seem to understand why this incredibly unreasonable charge made me upset to have to pay it. Then when we got to Sydney there was no indication of what carousel the luggage was on the flight wasn't listed on the carousel boards and I had to ask the airport concierge where Tiger luggage usually comes out - Carousel 6 if you get into this situation. The flight arrived on time but we sat on the tarmac for ages waiting for a previous Tiger flight to clear the gate. Not good when you are travelling for business.

SYD-OOL-SYD. Purchased flights for myself and two friends on line $30 each way return for $60 however there is a $15 booking fee so cost $75. Flight out of Sydney was delayed by half an hour return flight from Coolangatta also late to leave but landed on time. Seats had little to no leg room but ok for short flights staff were pleasant and flight was uneventful. First time with Tiger would fly with them again if the price is right.

Economic = Yes Reliable = Zero. Purchased $59.99 SYD-MEL flight each way. Outbound flight was initially delayed for 2 hours. Requesting possible refund to make booking to other airline was advised no refund is given unless delay is more than 6 hours. Having stranded at the domestic airport for 2 hours was further informed that the flight was further delayed for another hour. Flight was finally touched down at Melbourne at 7 evening. There goes my unproductive half day for the weekend.

### Tigerair Australia customer review
Arrived 40 mins before the scheduled departure of from Coolangatta to Sydney and 50 mins before the flight actually left Coolangatta. This was last flight to Sydney for Tiger or any other airline. Was refused entry because ticket counter had closed about 10 mins earlier and they would not issue a boarding pass. Gate staff did absolutely nothing to assist and watched us for about 50 mins and repeatedly refused to do anything that would enable us to board the aircraft. We had our confirmation printed from the Internet with us. There was no other staff to speak with at the airport. After 50 mins the gate staff slammed the door in our face. No help no apology. Additionally they refused entry to 4 school children in the same situation as us who arrived 5 mins before us. Absolutely the worst "customer service" experience of my life.

### Tigerair Australia customer review
Departure and arrival were both on time even though we boarded quickly we were kept waiting 20min in both directions while the crew chatted with ground crew there was no sense of urgency where other airlines would leave early in order to get their passengers off at the other end early. Another huge negative is the lack of online check-in which forces passengers to be at the airport at least an hour before flight for a domestic route which is unacceptable when both Virgin and Jetstar allow online check-in with presentation at gate up to 20 min before departure. While seats have more room that the new Virgin high density aircraft the seats seem old with less back support. Tea and Coffee very pricey at $4 for instant and $3.50 for a 200ml can of soft drink.

SYD-MEL-SYD day trip today. Thought we would give them a fair go. Electronic check-in was not functioning. Arrived at airport check-in 2 hours (as required) before flight to MEL but there were no staff to carry out the check-in for 30 min and then a computer glitch that lasted another 15 min. Check-in was also at a different gate to what had been put on the emailed receipt. Sent to departure gate on boarding pass - as time came up for boarding and no staff had arrived another passenger noticed that the electronic boarding notices had a gate change so we all walked to the other side of Sydney's domestic terminal. No Tiger staff made an announcement about the gate change. Again without a word explanation or apology from Tiger staff the departure time changed to the time of the next flight. Once boarded onto this flight we sat on the tarmac for a considerable time waiting for a staff member "stuck in traffic". The return flight was also delayed after check-in time (supposed to leave MEL at 17.50) again with no comments from staff just a quiet change to the notice board - the 2 following flights left for SYD before our flight did - we were finally boarded at 19.35 getting back to SYD at 21.00. Flight crews were pleasant enough but ground crews were rude and unhelpful. Husband is 6'4" and had his knees jammed against the seat in front of him the entire trip. Will never fly with them again.

### Tigerair Australia customer review
PER-MEL twice in the last couple of months. Check in at PER is great with the only delay being caused by pax who are overweight with their bags. Both times the flights were on time the planes clean and the crews efficient if not overly friendly. For what you pay its not too bad now they have their reliability sorted.

MEL-SYD. Quite good punctuality fair staff service and seats that would be a tight fit for a taller man. Overall reasonable and not deserving of some of the criticism as the airline has clearly taken a turn for the better under the new management.

Booked a flight for my son to travel from Gold Coast to Melbourne. After a delay of 4.5 hours Tiger decided to cancel the flight. Cost me another $429 to book another flight with a different airline for the next day. Magically all other flight prices increased dramatically. Tiger said they will refund airfare but it will take 2 weeks. Last time we fly with this airline. You obviously get what you pay for.

My husband and daughter's flight from Sydney to Melbourne due to leave at 7am was cancelled and they could not get on to another one until 3.35pm. They spent 8.5 hours at Sydney airport. Tiger check-in staff were rude and abrupt. There was nothing offered to compensate for the delay. The phone number on the standard sheet they gave out was disconnected. I rang to ask if my daughter's flight could be changed by one day so that she could have the full 3 days in Melbourne. I was told that this was not possible unless I paid $120. What a cowardly approach from senior management. Shame on you Tiger.

Booked a flight Sydney-Melbourne and after a frustrating time booking the flight with their deceptive Internet site managed to get a ticket with carry on luggage only. Arrived at the airport to discover that my combined weight exceeded the 10 kg limit and was slugged $70 for the privilege of putting my bag in the aircraft hold. They utilize contractors to handle the booking in and they simply sprout the OSH line. Then to top it off they get the wrong gate for boarding.

### Tigerair Australia customer review
Travelled from Melbourne to Sydney. I did not realise my handbag would be weighed as part of my carry-on. I was 2 kgs over the limit and was asked to pay an extra $77 to check-in my carry-on (not my handbag). I understand it was a cheap flight and they have to have rules but $77 for 2 kgs was excessive. My family had to come back to the airport to take home items from my carry-on.

MEL-SYD 22 June 2012. Check-in was efficient and the flight departed on time. Ground staff was rude and the FAs looked lethargic and uninterested albeit friendly.

PER-SIN return. Calm and very efficient check-in at Budget terminal SG. Just allow enough time for connections and getting to the budget terminal using free bus from T2 basement. My planning was at fault due to my incoming flight on another airline landing slightly late but Tiger check-in staff were helpful even though the check-in was already closed. Inflight: basic as expected but always patient and efficient. Used Visa for meals/drinks where you leave your card with the steward staff and just settle it all up near the end of the flight. If you like lots of inflight entertainment Tiger is not for you but now I know the routine I would definitely fly Tiger again.

Paid $25 per seat for rows 30ABCD assuming as these were premium seats there would be extra leg room. The seats had less leg room than normal seats they did not recline and had the toilets directly behind so the noise from toilets flushing meant no sleep for the 4 hour flight from Melbourne to Perth.

SYD-MEL flight. TOur gate was changed 3 times in the airport only to find after 1.5 hrs half waiting for a delayed plane that it was cancelled. They tried to get us onto other flights but it was not to Tullamarine only to Avalon where we would all have to get on a bus to Tullamarine. Customer service was below poor there was none to be honest. We had been at the airport since 11am and did not get to Melbourne until 10.50pm. Do not get sucked into their cheap airfares everything else about their airline is bad.

Boarded a Tiger flight in Sydney for flight to Melb. Was sat in cabin for 50 mins with no activity or movement. On departure no explanation was offered. During the flight 2 flight attendants began to argue and it turned nasty and uncomfortable for passengers in the front row where we sat watching a girl have strips torn off her by a woman who felt she was the centre of the universe. I wrote a letter of complaint but had to send it to Singapore E-mail address as there is no local E-mail contact with them in Australia.

Melbourne-Brisbane cancelled for the second time. This time at 2130 the night before an 0615 flight. I received an SMS stating the flight was cancelled and there was nothing available until Sun. Our only option would be to now buy $500 one way tickets for the family with Qantas or Virgin adding $2000 to our weekend trip to Queensland. It is a false Economy to book Tiger. You may get there but then again you may not. I have travel insurance and they can't assist me other than to pay me back for missed hotel bookings. If it's important that you arrive at your destination when you planned then book with a real airline. We've learnt our lesson.

Every flight we have been on has been cancelled at the last minute with no explanation and offered flights several days later (when we are supposed to be home). Spent more on the 4 hr drive to the cancelled flight than I ever would have saved. Can't contact "customer service" no notifications - even their website says the flight is running. Terrible.

### Tigerair Australia customer review
Flight was cancelled from Melbourne-Cairns. No text message no email warning was sent. Only found out when I contacted Tiger with a query about web check in - they'd sent me an email reminding me to web check-in then when I clicked on the link was advised that web check in was not available for my flight. The guy I spoke to sounded like a computer and honestly could not have cared less that my travel plans had been ruined. Offered a refund (in six weeks' time) or a spot on the next available flight (paying the difference of course) which was four days later and not suitable. Had to buy an expensive last minute flight to replace it.

### Tigerair Australia customer review
We will not fly with Tiger again because they are far too unreliable. The final straw was this morning when the Perth Avalon flight was deferred from 08:40 to 17:30 after already being rescheduled by 12 hours when Tiger rearranged their Australian schedules earlier this year (to improve reliability!) . Of the 5 sectors that we have booked over the last 3 years only one flight left at the originally booked time (PER/SIN in 2008). None of the delays were related to a natural disaster like volcanic ash. Three (including today) were delayed by many hours and we only found out at the airport. Two were rescheduled by 12 hours when Tiger rearranged their schedules earlier this year causing significant problems with our holiday. A one in five success rate is appalling even for a discount airline. It is especially bad in a large country like Australia where regularly cancelling rescheduling or delaying the one flight a day causes people major inconvenience. Luckily this morning we were able to rebook with another reliable airline though this goes to Melbourne Airport which is less convenient than Avalon for this trip.

### Tigerair Australia customer review
Flight cancelled from Brisbane-Sydney. No text message no email warning was sent. Only found out once we had arrived at the airport. Staff advised they did not know why. Offered a refund or a flight the next day which was not suitable seeing as the only reason we were going was to attend an important event on the Saturday night. Taking a replacement flight would have been as wasted trip. Had to buy a super expensive flight x 3 extremely costly! Even if they manage to get us home today will not be flying Tiger airways again. Don't buy cheap flights - it is truly not worth the savings.

MEL-BNE-MEL SIN-KUL PEN-SIN SIN-KCH-SIN. All flights were punctual. Flights were bargain- basement cheap and one shouldn't compare the airline for a full-service airline. Would not hesitate to fly Tiger again!

### Tigerair Australia customer review
Cancelled my Melbourne-Brisbane flight less than 24 hrs inevitably meaning I paid about twice as much compared to other airlines due to then requiring a last minute ticket. 2 of my colleagues also had their flights cancelled (different routes) and given a similar "operational reason" without any further explanation.

AVV-SYD. Flight arrived ex OOL but incomprehensibly inefficient boarding where an inexperienced and very slow male staff member saw us depart 20 mins late. Flight only had 70 or so passengers on the 180 seat A320. Staff went through the motions of selling the usual snacks but few passengers purchased anything. 1 female flight attendant lacked any manners and was noticeably curt to female passengers although more civil to males. The other flight attendants looked bored. The flight failed to pick up any time with arrival at the SYD airport gate some 25" down. This flight alone would have lost a few thousand dollars. While not at a peak time one wonders how much longer before part owners such as Singapore Airlines pull the pin on the Australian operation where clearly (when not affected by natural events such as volcanic ash) flights are cancelled daily due to either an aircraft failure or low passenger numbers. Of course Tiger is not the only airline to do this: all the domestic airlines in Australia engage in such practices but Tiger is the worst based on objective BITRE figures.

Sydney to Sunshine Coast easy web check in flight on time and crew charming. Sunshine Coast to Sydney easy web check in flight cancelled without any communication (either email address or mobile number supplied with booking) and no answer from customer service number in Melbourne (long distance call). Tiger is fine until they decide to cancel a flight. That's when you learn that flying Tiger is flying false economy. I strongly recommend flying any other airline.

Booked a family holiday from Sydney to the Sunshine Coast for 6 adults and 3 children. Was phoned 1 hour before check in that the flight was cancelled and we could go to either Brisbane at 16.45 flight or to the Gold Coast at 15.20. We thought the Brisbane flight would get us closer to our destination we then tried to get our rental car changed from the Sunshine Coast to Brisbane they advised us that they didn't have any cars available. We phoned Tiger back and advised them that we had no way of getting from Brisbane to the Sunshine Coast at such a late time on a Sun evening and asked them what they can do for us the response was nothing. As we agreed to go on the Brisbane flight they have managed to wash their hands completely of any assistance in accommodation for the night until we could obtain transport from Brisbane. Our return section was just as bad we phoned them on the Sat to make sure our flight was still flying and was told yes. After our initial trouble getting to the Sunshine Coast we didn't rely on Tiger at all and phoned them back again a few hrs later to once again be told that our flight was cancelled and that they could only put us on a flight from Brisbane at 2005 - even though their website showed seats available on earlier flights. Those with young children would understand that 20.05 flight to get home around 23.00 is not at all ideal. Tiger were not prepared to assist us in anyway.

As per the previous comment we also booked our flight to Sydney from the Sunshine Coast and paid for accommodation and return flights with another airline. We were sent no text or email and booked in over the net. On arrival at the airport we were told all flights with Tiger from the Sunshine Coast were cancelled. We could change our flights to Tues - but they could not guarantee the flight would not also be cancelled. We will never ever make this mistake again!

BNE-SYD-BNE. I received a call just under 4 hrs from departure to say flight was cancelled. I first though it was a joke. Next available flight offered 24hrs later or a refund. I took the refund for full trip as I was only going for the weekend so to miss a day was pointless. Other airlines were very expensive to purchase at the last minute so I missed my weekend. I received a text 24hrs prior to say return flight was cancelled and to call Tiger. My issues that they can't put an apology in that very brief cancellation text message that they ask the customer to call and chase the refund and that the refund can take 3-6 weeks. I've flown them at least 4 times and have had a couple of minor delays & have been happy to buy bargain flights. Not any more! I will pay more in future for hopefully reliable flying.

I booked a flight to Sydney booked accommodation etc and then received a text message two hrs before check in to inform us the only flight from the Sunshine coast had been cancelled. The text asked me to phone a phone number in Melbourne (no 1800 number available) waited for 40 mins before someone answered. Had great difficulty understanding her basic English. Ruined holiday thanks Tiger! No reason given for cancellation. The cheap fare has ended up being quite expensive. Will never fly Tiger again.

I waited at Perth Airport for a flight to Avalon Airport near Geelong Victoria. The departures screen claimed that the flight was on time. At the departure time no staff appeared at the gate though the departures screen still claimed that the flight was on time. Then there was an announcement over the PA saying that the flight had been cancelled for "operational reasons" and that passengers should go downstairs to collect their luggage. Despite this the departures screen claimed that the flight was on time. The passengers all had to go down the stairs and collect their luggage and then join a huge queue of angry passengers at the checkin counter. I managed to get a Tigerair flight to Tullamarine Melbourne leaving 14 hours later though I was originally booked to Avalon Geelong. Tiger Airlines did not provide any assistance with food accommodation or transport.

Sydney to Adelaide on 13/6/2011 was cancelled due to the Volcanic Ash but was not updated on their website. We proceeded to the airport as per their instructions on the website only to be told that all flights to Adelaide has been suspended and that the next available flight out is 2 days later. No form of notification as to update of the status of the flights. On top of that every other experience with Tigerair has always been met with flight delay or cancellation. Cheap tickets are definitely not worth the unreliability.

### Tigerair Australia customer review
I booked 3 different flights and without explanation they changed all flight times from early morning to night. After contacting customer service and trying very hard to understand their poor english I gave up. I continued with the rescheduled flights and missed the very thing I was supposed to be there for. I will never fly with Tiger again and I will not recommend to ever fly Tiger.

Sydney-Melbourne-Sydney Flight. On the return leg all the airport screens were displaying that our flight had been cancelled. We enquired with staff who said they would not help us until we line up and attempt to check in. After about one hour of waiting to see if we'll actually fly we were allowed to check in. Departure was delayed by approximately 2.5 hours we were not offered anything not even water while we waited. Onboard the aircraft it was filthy some life jackets had come out of the capsules under the seats and were just left there by staff. We were not greeted onto the aircraft.

My return flight Sydney to Brisbane was cancelled with no explanation. I only found out (luckily) 2 days before hand when I was attempting to do web check in. I was told that I could swap the tickets for another trip or receive a refund. When looking at their website I noticed that there were tickets being advertised for the same day as I was wanting to travel. When I asked if I could these tickets I was told that these tickets where actually sold out and that the website had not been updated. That if I were to book these tickets online (which the system was letting me do) I would find out later that my trip had been cancelled again due to overbooking. I subsequently book my tickets with another airline at considerable cost due to short notice. I was told that I would receive a refund in 3-6 weeks from Tiger. On looking at the Tiger website the following day I discovered that the trip I had wanted to book was still being advertised and I could still book on line if I wanted to. Therefore potentially there is a lot of customers who could have been booking that trip over the last two days only to discover that there trip had been cancelled due to over booking. Tiger seems to have a system that is set up for a lot of disappointment for a lot of people.

### Tigerair Australia customer review
Arrived at the airport only to find out that the flight had been cancelled. Staff informed me that many other flights have been cancelled today and yesterday however Tiger did not deem it necessary to inform me any earlier! Staff kept apologising which i must admit is the only thing they do well (they must be used to it seeing the amount of times flights are cancelled). My flight was at 8.45pm and I was offered another flight the following day at 8.45pm. I chose not to take that offer and managed to get a refund (which will apparently arrive in 3-4 weeks). I booked my flight with Virgin which set me back A$250 one-way SYD-MEL. I will never fly Tiger again.

### Tigerair Australia customer review
Flight cancelled at 10pm the night before the flight from Melbourne to Brisbane I was one of the lucky ones to get a text. I will never fly with them again. On hold for 30 minutes then dealt with a rude operator who could only offer me a flight after I was due back at work. Not worth the saving on the airfare at all. It will take 3-6 weeks for a refund I chose to book my flight home with another airline.

### Tigerair Australia customer review
My return flight from Sydney to Melbourne was cancelled and no notification was given to passengers. Consequently the line at Sydney airport was huge and Tiger was completely understaffed to deal with the excess passengers. For cancelling the flight we were offered a refund or a seat on a flight some five hours later. However there were only 20 seats available on the later flight so some people would have missed out. I was one of the lucky ones who got a seat on the later flight. However this later flight also encountered delays. At no point were passengers offered an explanation or an apology. You might save money with the ticket prices but you will pay for it later with terrible service.

### Tigerair Australia customer review
Disgraceful. Flight cancelled via text 10pm night before 6am flight. Staff very unhelpful after waiting on hold for close to an hour. Lost $250 car hire and $450 accommodation fees. Never use Tiger again. Flight shows as sold out on web and still scheduled to fly out at 6 in the morning?

### Tigerair Australia customer review
We left home at 7am for 0845 flight to Melbourne for the weekend. Our flight was initially delayed by an hour only minutes before boarding time. Within hour an hour our flight was cancelled without adequate explanation. The airline also left it to a lone employee to face the dozens of disgruntled and disappointed passengers. We spent 7 hours at Sydney domestic airport and eventually got offered a $5 voucher for McDonalds or a terminal cafe. After a long mindless day looking around T2 & T3 shops we boarded the plane at 1:45. After more waiting everyone dutifully seat belted in the cabin crew announced that 10 people never showed for the flight (not a surprise) and their bags had to be removed from the plane. This caused a further 45 min delay. In total it took 10 hours from leaving our home in Sydney to arriving at our hotel Melbourne. This airline is disgraceful.

### Tigerair Australia customer review
Everyone says you only fly Tiger once! I forgot my print out web check in ticket and when I arrived at the airport Tiger had the audacity to charge me $30 for a counter check in! Add this to the $15 fee of using your credit card to book tickets and this airline is a rip off. I now will pay the extra and fly Qantas or Virgin.

### Tigerair Australia customer review
My flight was cancelled no notice no explanation no apology. Given option of refund which takes 3-6 weeks or flight tomorrow. Girls on the desk were rude and unhelpful. When asked if I would be put up for the night was told 'I'm under instructions to not give anyone accommodation. Disgraceful service should not be allowed to operate in this country.

Flight cancelled no warning (why do they collect your contact details?) no apology and no care or empathy shown. Raises concerns about other aspects of the company's operations. Cheap flight but left out of pocket by hundreds of dollars. I will never fly Tiger again.

Disgusted - so excited to be spending a weekend in Melbourne for our anniversary just a couple of hours before we are due to go to the airport we get a call the flight has been cancelled I thought it was someone playing a joke. They even sent through a flight confirmation email this evening. Will never fly Tiger!

Awful Flights cancelled without warning apology or reason; leaving us stranded and eventually costing us hundreds extra to get home. Never use Tiger!

### Tigerair Australia customer review
Incredibly unsatisfactory - do not fly with them. I used web check in and made sure my bag was under 10 kilos because I know how exorbitant their over weight fees are. However did not count on them weighing my handbag! Only 1 kilo over but had to fork out $70 to check in my luggage. The staff were rude and unhelpful about this ridiculous situation. Is it any wonder the company is in trouble?

### Tigerair Australia customer review
Terrible. 2 hours late like everyone else that's posted here. No apology no explanation - like everyone else has said here. Their boarding passes say they love being on time. How would they know? It looks like they have never had a flight that was on time.

I was supposed to fly out of Adelaide on 27 April 2011 to Melbourne and was told as I checked in (with four other family members) that the flight was cancelled and they booked us on a flight for 29 April 2011 to Melbourne at 7.30 am . After arriving to check in and waiting 4 hours they told us the flight was cancelled 'again'. Offering me a refund in 48 hours I had to find another carrier to fly home with. Cancelling a flight once was very disappointing but twice just reflects that these people should not run an airline. Reason for the cancellation was not given apart from operational reasons. Hopefully CASA shuts them down.

Booked Tiger BNE-SYD and back during this Easter weekend to attend cousins wedding. Flight to SYD - waiting time to check in (we had luggage) 1hr followed by flight delay for almost 2hrs - no explanation. So missed out on pre-wedding family function as everyone had gone home by the time we arrived in SYD. Return flight long queue at check in counter with very slow operations. By the time our time came we were told check in for that flight was closed and we had to take another flight. In other words 'you are hereby abandoned good luck'. Had no option but to purchase new tickets with another airline - with 3 young children this was an absolute abuse. Appreciate Tiger is cheap travel but people are not cattle.

### Tigerair Australia customer review
Booked Tiger for our return Adelaide to Melbourne arrived at airport early so as not to miss check in - only to be told our flight had been delayed due to fog. Then 4 hrs later it was cancelled entirely. While it may be true word of mouth can be the best advertising never lose sight of the fact in can be the worst.

BNE-MEL-BNE. Outbound delayed 2hrs with no explanation and then flight boarding never called - lucky I was near the gate and followed everyone else! Onboard service was passable crew friendly. Return flight - loaded us on and then technical issue saw us unloaded and transferred to another flight (via security- again!) total delay 2.5hrs. Total cost of my time 4.5hrs. add this to the regular flight times to and from and needing to be there at least a hr prior to check in = 10.5hrs. Qantas next time where I don't need to spend a day of my life just to get to MEL and back.

Melbourne (Tulla) to Gold Coast - flight delayed more than an hour with no explanation. Finally boarded at 6.55 (flight was scheduled to leave at 5.40) where the pilot briefed us that there was an issue with a passenger onboard the previous flight hence the delay. The flight crew then conducted their safety spiel as well as cross checking. We then sat on the tarmac a further 50 minutes! I've flown with Tiger once before this trip and found the staff rude and unhelpful. I thought I'd luck out this time but it was by far the worst air trip of my life. Unfortunately need to return to Melbourne with them but never again after that. You get what you pay for.

Flight scheduled for 0855 this morning. Got to the airport at 0700 to find that the flight was cancelled and were told that the next available flight to Melbourne was in 2 days time!

MEL-ADL. First and last time I fly with this airline. Flight was due to depart around 2pm then told a delay of 2 hrs due to mechanical issue and they had no spare aircraft. Then flight delayed for another 3 hours because the aircraft rescheduled to do operate our flight had to go to Tasmania and back. Eventually left Melbourne around 8:45pm.

Pleasantly surprised on my flight from SYD to BNE travelling with my 4 year old son. A320 in great condition and cabin looked tidy. Very young cabin crew but very energetic assisting people to get carry-on stowed in overhead compartments. Good information from the flight deck. Flight was initially delayed by 30 minutes due to late arrival of air craft but lost another 30 minutes standing at the gate after boarding completed with no further explanation from the flight deck. Seat pitch very tight and just bearable for a 70 minute flight. Could not purchase emergency exit seating as I was travelling with a toddler. Fare not much cheaper than QF or DJ. Would fly TT again in the future but only if the fare is significantly cheaper than the competitors.

Sunshine Coast - Sydney return. Bargain fare of $29.95 each way. Departing flight on time and baggage checked in with minimal fuss. Unfortunately if you have baggage you cannot check in so if there are other persons on the booking who have/can check in online unless they also present at the counter you aren't seated together. Flight was 50% full and staff were pleasant if not robotic. Returning flight was delayed 25 mins with no explanation. A late gate change also took place but this was advised over the PA system. Returning flight had a much more pleasant and jovial crew. I asked at check in for an emergency exit row seat and this was not a problem. For what I paid I was more than happy and if I can secure this flight at such a cheap price again I would snap it up.

Perth to Avalon was cancelled and changed to later flight but to Melbourne Tulla. Then had to find our own way back to our car at Avalon. Never fly Tiger. Pay the extra and fly with a real airline. Apparently Tiger are not obligated to service their passengers as the other domestic carriers and can cancel flights at a whim.

### Tigerair Australia customer review
MEL-ADL. There seems to be less chance of delays on Tiger the earlier in the day you fly. At 9.30am the terminal was quiet and the flight was on time. The new uniforms are marginally better than the old ones (at least they are all the same colour). Im 6"0 and found the leg room much much smaller than other domestic carriers - my knees were pushed uncomfortably against the back of the seat in front of me for the entire flight. The 1 hours flights they are fine and you do get what you paid for. I cannot imagine trying to do a 3+ hour flight in such a cramped seat.

Melbourne-Mackay return. First flight cancelled for "operational reasons" after arriving at the airport at 4am to make sure we had finished booking in 45 minutes early and then told to come back the next day return flight delayed in the end by 12 hours. As some of the party were flying internationally the next day we had to cancel 6 tickets and book Virgin at double the price (but they were extremely helpful). Tiger staff were rude unhelpful and did not keep the rest of us updated. The engineer was due to arrive at 4.30pm (flight meant to leave at 9.25am) but believe he arrived at 8pm (no advice). We finally boarded 12 hours later - no apologies. Upon calling the call centre which cheerfully told me that they are now open to midnight every day it then told me that they were closed - at 7pm.

### Tigerair Australia customer review
Booked flight on Tiger from Melbourne to Perth after flying other way on Qantas. Ticket suggested arriving 2 hrs early to check luggage in. Flight was delayed 3 1/2 hrs from normal departure. Check in staff looked disinterested and unfriendly. I'm average height and found the seats on the A320 very close to those in front and claustrophobic. If you are tall I would suggest looking elsewhere. Add up all the fees and the price difference to Qantas given the lack of service and comfort doesn't make it worth flying Tiger.

Way to Melbourne: Wrong boarding gate printed on boarding pass plane delayed 5 hours at Sydney airport while they tried to fix a problem with the computer management on the plane. Sat on the plane for over an hour while the stewards drank coffee and gossiped. No refreshments served and no assistance what so ever. Had to switch to Qantas as there were no other tiger flights. Still waiting for refund. Return from Melbourne: Plane delayed 4 hours due to late arrival from Sydney airport. Great deal of confusion among travellers with very little information provided. Many confused travellers trying to board Sydney flight who actually had their boarding gate changed. They were supposed to board from another gate and were not informed until last minute. Supreme lack of professionalism. Lack of staff lack of information and thus far lack of refund.

Syd-Bne. Started boarding passengers then off loaded them. Told there was an engineering fault with plane. 45 mins later we were told the engineer was in Melbourne and over an hour away from landing in Sydney. I had an international flight to catch the following morning and was told that maybe I should look at trying to get a flight on another airline which I was luckyto do and had to pay an extreme price for. I rang Tiger when I got back to Brisbane and asked for a refund and was told they would only be able to refund the cost of their cheap ticket and the refund would be processed in 3-6 weeks! They are very quick to take the money but not so quick to refund!

Booked Melbourne to Gold Coast 0630 departure to be in Gold Coast in plenty of time to go to wedding at 1300 on 19th May. Booked flight two months ago. Just received email stating flight has been 'rescheduled' to 1330 departure. Will arrive in Gold Coast 2.5 hrs after wedding starts! Have flown Tiger many times without problem. No offer of refund or to get put on a flight the day before. I know you get what you pay for and the tickets are cheap but it is still that a ticket at a time that I booked would not be complaining if I had bought a standby ticket but I did not.

SYD-MEL Return. First leg of flight delayed 1.5 hrs due to insufficient staff for the flight second leg of flight delayed 45 mins with no reason given; flight time for second leg was announced as 1 hr 5 mins but turned out to be 1.5 hrs; first leg walked on aircraft-fumed tarmac in windy and wet conditions inside cabin was worn and dirty (only one of our seat pockets had a flight magazine and it was stuck to the back of the pocket with chewing gum). Announcements in the cabin with the volume at super loud setting - poor facilities at Departure lounge in Melbourne. It cost us $40 to reserve seats.

Melbourne-Tullamarine-Gold Coast-Avalon A320. Flight delayed by 2 hours in Melbourne Tullamarine airport but inflight service was reasonably good. Flight delayed by 3 hours on the return from Gold Coast to Avalon but again the in-flight experience was acceptable. Crew friendly good service and food. Major issue with Tigerair is the ability to meet their deadline in punctuality. Flight cancellations is a major issue I've experienced with Tiger Airways which cost me dearly. Very poor call center customer service very difficult to explain things to the operator and very hard to communicate. Overall if younger travelers plan to go for short trips its definitely worth taking the risk with Tigerair as they offer dirt cheap flights and in the end you get what you pay for. However I would not recommend tiger airways for families and elderly passengers due to a poor record in meeting flight deadlines and a high flight cancellation rate.
