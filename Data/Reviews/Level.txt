### "downgraded my premium economy"
I bought Premium Economy seats for my family of 3. And, on the day of flight, they downgraded all of my 3 premium economy due to overbooking and all of us got random seats separately for more than 12 hrs of long international flight from Spain to Los Angeles. I complained about this involuntary change of seats and they only said this happens a lot and i only need to complain to the Iberia on the website. The crew at the check in counter is not employees of this airline and they are the third party contractors thus they can be no help at all even with this major issue like this. Level say I should resolve the complaints through Iberia and they were no help at all.

### "Worst flight so far"
First and last time I'm flying this airline. Worst flight so far in terms of the airplane. Toilets were dirty. None of the restrooms had water in the sink  for a 10-hour flight. I had to ask the flight attendant for sanitary wipes otherwise they didn't proactively supply. Food not good. I think the flight attendants were ok. Smooth flight. Great landing by the pilot. I don't think ill ever choose Level again.

### "Worst airline I've ever used"
Worst airline I've ever used. Their check-in crew closed the gate early, couldn't be reached at the airport. Luckily TSA let me through since I had proof I purchased a ticket. When I got to the gate no one was able to help me because none of the people working the gate work for Level (it's all third party). They have terrible customer service, terrible food on board, everything including seat selection costs money. I highly recommend avoiding this airline.

### "I expected much better conditions"
I recently booked my ticket through Iberia for a roundtrip to Spain. The flight there was perfect, everything was orderly and we received proper attention and accommodations, including dinner, snack, pillow, blanket, and headphones. We had a working television. On the flight back, though, Murphy’s law took hold. And LEVEL,  (Iberia is responsible for the operation of LEVEL) are to blame. There was no order when it came to boarding the plane. There was no group calling, or preference for those that had disabilities, children, or strollers. Everything was a free for all. While they were admitting passengers, among the mayhem, they had us descend the escalators, where we thought we were to board the plane. There was a flight of spiral stairs, with no  elevators. Having been traveling with my grandmother, her among others had experienced trouble, pain, and dangerous circumstances coming down to a bus to take us to the airplane and would make us go up the STAIRS onto the plane as well. As this flight was operated by Iberia, we expected to receive our dinner meal, as well as some assortment of snacks and water. They did not feed us, seemingly choosing passengers at random if they had or had not “pre-ordered their meals”, which was complete lunacy considering they still asked passengers what meal they desired, and were left with many leftovers. They also did not notify or message that we had to request meals in advance. We were also not given the basic amenities such as a pillow, blanket, or headphones. There was a TV screen behind each seat that served as decoration, as it did not turn on the entire flight. There was not even a functioning outlet. The staff were unpolished, unprepared, and incredibly rude to me. For a ticket over $500, I expected much better conditions.

### Level customer review
Not Verified |  This trip booked on LEVEL was the worst flight experience that we have ever had. They canceled our flight to Barcelona from Boston the afternoon we were flying and rebooked us on another Iberia flight that was 2 hours later. They separated our group on the new flight. Our return trip was a nightmare. We had paid for exit row seats but one hour before the flight they moved us to regular economy seats and told us to apply online for a refund of the extra fees for the better seats online. The web site is horrible and when I entered my flight information it said that it didn't match their records. I called and they said that the refund can only be done online! The A330 was in terrible shape. The entertainment system was not working. The bathroom cupboard doors were taped shut. The bathroom was dirty and badly worn. The toilet seats were stained and had old tape adhesive across them.

### "The experience was okay"
The experience was okay, especially in Premium Economy. I don’t know if this is what you would expect for Premium Economy, but I can tell your firsthand it’s not too bad compared to other airlines with low budget such as this one. It had okay meals, it was kind of mid though, it tasted a bit bitter. The in-flight entertainment was okay. There were movies, of which there was only 30 (very limited if you compare to other airlines). There was a USB Port for charging and a Headphone Plug. If your looking for something cheap, I would recommend Level.

### “customers are obviously not important”
From inception at the gate we had bad feelings. Gate agents were very rude and could not care less what passengers were asking. They informed us that the plane was parked on the other side of the Airport near freight and repairs. We had to be transferred there by bus. We each had to walk down several flights of stairs carrying our carry-ons and hand helds. Then walk up the stairs to board the plane, with NO HELP. We sat there on the plane for 3 hours and were told several lies by the pilot such as; we are waiting to be released by air traffic control, and waiting for new crew members. They finally said we are leaving and promised us free "Drinks", which never happened. We had asked and tried to use WiFi and were told it’s broken. This is a very unprofessional Airline, customers are obviously not important, and we will never use them again.

### "extremely uncomfortable"
The airline we flew was Level. I purchased extra leg room and they changed planes so we did not get leg room my husband had knee surgery he was extremely uncomfortable. Worse airline ever. Our Level flight back to Los Angeles was rescheduled without any prior notice. I receive a confirmation from expedia confirming our departure. Get to airport no such flight, they moved it to 2 days later. I spoke to the airlines each one blamed the other.

### "a voucher that does not work"
Not Verified |  I had a flight that got canceled a year ago. At that moment, LEVEL gave me a voucher so I can book a new flight. Trying to book a flight today, I realized that the voucher does not work, even though it is still supposed to be valid. Worried, I tried to contact the company by the online chat. The employee told ma that he don't know why the voucher does not work and that he cant help me with that. He told me somebody else will contact me in a day or two. Since then, no news from anybody. They take my money, give me a voucher that does not work, and now nobody seems to want to help me. I needed to book some tickets today and now I cant. The staff I talked to was rude and useless.

### "there is very little legroom"
Not Verified |  The gate staff had us wait one hour lined up at the gate before boarding commenced. I feel like it would have been more efficient to allow us to wait in the gate area, and the called us to board when boarding was actually ready. This would have been an easy way to avoid some discomfort. Additionally there is very little legroom and the food is the worst I’ve had on an international flight.

### "Poorly organized and poorly managed"
Not Verified | We had booked a flight on Iberia Website. Boston (BOS) to Barcelona (BCN) Everything about the booking seemed normal until we saw some fine print. Although Iberia booked our flight, the actual flight would be on Level Airways, which is a subsidiary of Iberia Airways. We've flown Iberia before and had no issues, a very good airline. We assumed that this would a good flight as well. Well, we couldn't be further from the truth, with that statement. Boarding was a bit confusing, yet they did get that sorted. Our flight had taken off with a slight 30-minute delay, due to a mechanical issue that they originally claimed would take a few hours to fix. They were about to take us off the plane, but the captain said that there was no further problem, and we can continue normally. After about one hour into the flight, we were told that a stabilizer was not ‘retracting’ completely. This was creating ‘drag’ on the aircraft, which was burning more fuel than expected. It would not give us enough fuel to reach our destination safely (Spanish coastline), and potentially run out of fuel. The captain turned the plane around and landed safely back at Boston Logan International Airport. Our original point of departure. We were all relieve that we landed safely. After arriving at the gate, the cabin crew as well as the remaining staff for the airline, remained silent. As if they were instructed to say nothing. We had no instructions or direction from any of the staff. Everyone from the flight proceeded to the ticket counter, to try and find out if there was any information available about rebooking, or if this flight would go back out tonight. Since it was already close to midnight, there was a strong sense that we would not be flying out at all. All the staff would tell us is, that we would receive an 'e-mail' with further instructions. (Which we never received.) The passengers that were there, including ourselves, had to figure out which baggage claim to retrieve our luggage. There was no assistance offered by the airline staff at all. Once we gathered our luggage, we arrange for a car service to bring us home. Luckily we were about 15 minutes away from the airport. Most of the passengers there were stranded and had nowhere to go. Finding out a day later we made the news. This airline has the worst communication skills that I have ever experienced in the 40+ years of flying. This is the 'SPIRIT' of Spain. Poorly organized and poorly managed. They are an example of what an airline should not be. Researching further, they cancel over 50% of their flights. They consistently blame someone else out of convenience. When calling Iberia, they would be helpful at first. But then when trying to get onto another flight that they had transferred us onto, the itinerary was wrong. We would miss all connecting flights. We would call back and they would do nothing for us. Just an egregious airline. They should have called it A 'LEVEL' BELOW. AVOID FLYING WITH THIS AIRLINE. NEVER AGAIN

### "we did not receive our meals"
We were a family of 6 adults and one toddler we bought tickets that included (a) 7 economy tickets, and paid for an upgrade to include (b) an upgrade to allow me to choose my seats ahead of time, (c) a meal plan for each passenger and (d) checked luggage. Well the upgrades to the reservation we did not receive. Because I chose an a la carte airline, I was encouraged to pay the added fee to pre-select my seats. As a large party, traveling with a toddler, I added the upgrade to the reservation and added the meal plan (for all seven tickets). Weeks before the trip, I logged into the website, confirmed our seats, added our trusted travel documents and selected our meals/beverages for the flight. When check-in opened 24hrs before take-off, our seats were different than what had been selected (leaving the toddler to be seated on his own). We called the airlines (Level and Iberia) and were informed that there had been a system issue and while the seats appeared to be different online, they were in reality as we had booked . When we approached the counter at JFK, the attendants informed us that the seats we had booked were no longer available/had been reserved for other passengers and we would not be able to occupy our reserved seats – despite providing supporting documentation with the details of our original reservation and the letter from corporate confirming them. Once on board, we did not receive the items included in our meal plan. Some passengers did not receive their food, some did not receive their beverages. One passenger received all of his items at the end of the flight. When we asked the crew for our items, we were told we had not pre-paid or that they would have to “look into it.” These events were not isolated to one leg of the trip, it repeated itself on our return trip – though this time they blamed a plane change for the issues. Again, we were told at the counter that we would not be able to occupy our seats, (b) we had not pre-paid, (c) nothing could be done and (d) we did not receive our meals. The aforementioned events cannot even be blamed on a language barrier as I am native Spanish speaker.

### "most horrible experience"
Not Verified |  The most horrible experience I’ve ever have for 40 years flying. It’s not cheap, when you add all necessities, and it’s more expensive than any others. Never again! No leg room, horrible service. Don’t buy it!

### "not a low cost airline"
Not Verified |  This is not a low cost airline. Premium economy tickets are more expensive than Air France (to Paris) or Lufthansa (to Munich). Impossible to get your boarding pass online. Level claims that your boarding pass will be emailed to you 24 hours prior to departure but I never received an email. When I go to their web site to check-in I keep getting error messages telling me to contact Level which of course is impossible at least not from California unless you want to call Spain at 1:00 am and even then, no one answers.

### "charge me a bag fee of 140 euros"
Not Verified |  Terrible. The counter agent wanted to charge me a bag fee of 140 euros for a one-way trip, even my ticket says one cabin bag and one underseat item. She would not check me in unless I paid. Not a single person in line paid for a bag fee and I was singled out. I was about to be late and had to pay. I came back and requested the refund and complained through the airline's website. I received no reply. Stay away from this terrible airline.

### "it's still as expensive as any other airline"
It's supposed to be a low cost company so that's why they don't offer food on long flights (+12h) but it's still as expensive as any other airline. Also, probably it's a company policy, but at some point the cabin crew shuts the windows even if there's light outside and it's daytime in the destination of origin (where everyone is used to the time already). So they basically decide when you should sleep or not. 30 minutes before landing, they offer a drink or a breakfast, so you don't even have the time to eat properly. Basically, it has the worst from a low cost company, but the price of a regular airline.

### "the very worst I have ever flown"
This airline is the worst you could choose. We flew to Barcelona. We bought and paid for bulk head seats. Those are the extra leg room seats because there is no seat in front of you. It cost us $175 each for both ways. A few days before the flight, we checked on line, and it showed the right seats. Then, on the day of the flight, the boarding passes were issued with seats in the middle of the row in the middle of the plane. We paid for the best seats and got the worst seats? Then, going back to LA, the same thing happened. Although we paid for the more expensive extra leg room, we were seated in the absolute back row next to the bathroom. Awful seats!! All they kept saying was “the plane is full. There is nothing we can do.” People on line said the same. Customer service was rude and hangs up. One person said, “No, that agent lied to you. Nothing can be done. Ask for your refund on-line.” The flight crew was not friendly at all. And the meal seemed like it was planned by a three year old (pasta, a roll, potato salad and cake). Plane bathrooms were dirty, smelly, and no paper. This airline is truly the very worst I have ever flown.

### "tried to contact this airline to cancel"
Booked tickets and then tried to contact this airline to cancel within 24 hours penalty free as per USDOT regulations. Every time I called the automated system ran me through several prompts only to get to the last prompt and the system hangs up on me and I talk to no one. Tried to call Iberia as recommended on the Level website and they tell me they cannot cancel a Level flight, even though Level directly suggests calling Iberia. Iberia suggests calling Vueling, another affiliated company, and could not reach them as the automated phone system would not allow me to talk to a person either.

### "had to settle for a refund"
Not Verified |  I can't really say how the airline would actually be in the air because the flight was canceled three weeks before departure, but only found out when I logged in to confirm the flight—booked as a gift for my daughter's honeymoon with a great price many months ago in Premium cabin. The airline would not rebook on any codeshare partners, even parent company Iberia. Only offered to rebook us on flights 4 days earlier (short honeymoon!) or 3 days later (have to work!). Finally had to settle for a refund and rebook onto TAP economy at hundreds of dollars more and an extra night in a hotel.

### "customer service is terrible and infuriating"
Our flight was with Level, which I believe is a partner of Iberia. We had a terrible experience and I do not recommend that anyone book flights with either of these airlines. They lost our luggage for 3 days. We arrived in Barcelona on Friday afternoon. We called the airline multiple times that weekend but they kept saying that our luggage was being searched for and couldn’t even tell us if the luggage had made it to Spain or was still in LA. I received a text late Sunday/early Monday that it would arrive that day sometime between 9 AM-4 PM. However, we were checking out of our AirBnB that morning and taking the train to Madrid that evening. We also wanted to spend our time exploring Barcelona instead of waiting all day for the luggage to arrive. I spoke to an airline staff and they agreed to deliver our luggage to our next AirBnB in Madrid. A few hours later, my cousin gets a call from another staff member who tells us that our luggage has been delivered to the AirBnB that we checked out of an hour or so ago, which is contradictory to the instructions I’d provided to the other staff member that morning (talk about lack of internal communication!). Fortunately, we were only a 10 minute drive away from the AirBnB. We tell the staff member we can be there in 10-15 minutes, and she gives us attitude about it and says that they cannot wait, especially when they had given us a delivery timeframe of 9 AM- 4 PM. We told her that they had lost our luggage for 3 days and caused us to waste time and money buying clothes and underwear - the bare minimum they can do now is wait 10 minutes for us to get back to the AirBnB. Fortunately, it worked out at that point and we were able to get the luggage. However, the customer service of Iberia and Level airlines is terrible and infuriating. The staff are completely indifferent and apathetic and do not care at all about clients. Save yourself a headache by avoiding them at all costs!

### "Don’t waste your money"
I bought my ticket many months ago (summer) and decided to add some upgrades. It’s my vacation after all, I thought. First I paid for a bag + meal combo. I needed the bag but it made sense to add a meal, after all it’s a 7 hour flight and the website makes it look like you won’t get one otherwise. Then I add a comfort seat for another $45 and pick which seat I have. Well, fast forward to my travel date. I check in and first there is a long, slow moving line. Then when I check in, I show my passport and boarding pass I printed, the agent smiles and says, “you won’t need that”. Then I get my ticket and later once I’m thru TSA I realize what she meant, my seat was moved to economy class. I though, ok must be a mistake, right? I go to the counter and it seems that there’s already a line of people with the same issue. All the agents can do it’s tell us it’s a full flight so they can’t do anything. She advises everyone to take a picture of the boarding pass (which I later needed to get a refund) but sounds like this happens way too often. It turns out everyone gets a free meal anyways. It’s deceptive practices. Don’t waste your money.

### "awful low cost company"
I was supposed to travel Business Class with Iberia from Madrid to Guatemala. To my horror and surpris I found out in the VIP lounge that I was denied access because I was no longer flying Business class with Iberia. This airline decided to switch planes, moving me to a so called Premium Economy in a plane from Level. I was not able to do anything about this change, so I was forced to travel with this awful low cost company with uncomfortable seats, terrible service (unprofessional and very rude crew). 11 hours of torture. Never ever again!

### "will never book with this airline again"
Not Verified | This review is for a flight that was cancelled and the promised refund was never returned despite calls and emails for over a year. They confirmed the refund, but then funds never appeared back into our account. Their repetitive response was that they would send our messages over to their team and they would work on it. We will never book with this airline again, which includes its overseer, Iberia. Very frustrating! This rating system does not allow zero stars unfortunately.

### "The worst experience ever"
The worst experience ever. Terrible customer service, no communications, no one to ask questions too, employees were rude and you have to pay for everything even in an 9hrs flight. 9hrs on a flight and when I paid $2 for a soda, I got a cup of soda. Was on two different lines for this airline and had to wait until I got to the booth to be told I was in the wrong line. Everything was a bad experience.

### "never fly this airline again"
Not Verified |  I know that cheap airlines are tempting, but it was so bad that it's not even worth the little you paid. My flight was delayed by hours with no explanation, announcement, or apology. The staff members and flight attendants are not there to provide you with a comfortable, safe, and enjoyable flight. They have one purpose and one purpose only: to get you to spend more money and make more purchases. For everything you would get for free on an average airline, you had to pay extra. I was supposed to arrive at JFK (an airport in New York) at 8.20 pm. I arrived at 10.20 and didn't leave the airport for hours after that because the baggage took forever to get to the baggage claim area. Level is a disappointment to airlines, and I would not recommend this airline to anyone. I will most certainly never fly this airline again.

### "the worst airline I’ve been on in my entire life"
Not Verified |  By far, the worst airline I’ve been on in my entire life. I booked a roundtrip flight from NYC to Barcelona for nearly $1,100 and the airline did not provide drinks, snacks, or food. They charge for everything. On top of that, the wait to get onboard took 1.5 hours flying in and flying out. In addition, I booked this flight under Iberia, not Level. There was no communication that I’ll be on a Level flight. Now, I’m not even inclined to fly Iberia anymore. I highly do not recommend either airline.

### 2no common food nor drink provided with your fare"
On a Level Airlines international flight across the Atlantic there is no common food nor drink provided with your fare. This might seem like a small change, but it is not. What I didn’t know and no amount of small-print words could adequately explain was how it would actually feel not to have food or drink served on an international flight. The food carts appeared out of nowhere bringing wonderful wafting smells. There was chatter as to what might be on the menu. Then the servers only served a scattering of folks who had paid and pre-ordered. The rest of us could ante-up for the extra supply kept on hand, but either way many on the 8-hour flight would go hungry. Then the drink cart came and I thought to console myself with a cranberry juice or a coca-cola, and those cost extra, too. I was not offered water, but when I asked for some the steward rearranged the bright products on his cart and came up with a small paper cup and voilá, I had my gulp of complimentary water. My travel time on this particular flight from Boston to Venice through Barcelona with a long layover was around 17 hours and booking more than a month in advance, the round trip price was $1,224 US. Why did I choose this airline over others? How much was the price differential? I could not remember.

### "Worst service and food"
Worst service and food. Seats are small, only 4 cabin crew for 300 people they even sell the headphones if you want to watch a movie bring your own. Also no subtitles available in any language. Took forever for the check in.

### "get what you pay for"
Paris to Fort de France. Level provides cheap long haul fares. You can choose from a number of options during booking, including baggage and meal options - which raises the prices quite a bit. After booking, there was very little spam and hassle. Paris Orly Airport is a bad way to start your holiday. Since we deliberately did not book any food or drink options, we brought plenty of foods and drinks, and consuming those on board was not a problem. We looked at the food that was pre booked and were surprised how small the portions were. Apart from that everything aboard the plane is on sale, you dont get a pillow, blanket or headphone - but we were prepared for that. Crew running through the aisle serving food and drinks was a tad unnerving. Crew was very strict in enforcing rules, i.e one passenger stood up right after landing, and crew immediately told him this next time they would call the police on him. The seat was surprisingly comfortable with lots of leg room, however we saw quite a few seats with gigantic entertainment boxes in the leg room. Entertainment system was free of charge, movie choice seemed rather small for a long haul flight. Internet was available, at a hefty price tag. In total, Level is a very clear "you get what you pay for" airline - and that is very little on both sides of the equation.

### "the worst treatment"
Major issues pre flight. Several months ago I booked a return flight from Paris to Boston on Level Airlines. A week ago i received a notice the flight had been cancelled. I contacted customer service and was told i could have a refund or they can rebook me to Newark. I asked about Barcelona to Boston and was told it was not an option. The Customer service rep told me i could take the rebooking and then file a claim online related to getting to Boston. No mention was made that if the claim was rejected i no longer would be allowed to get a refund. Sure enough they refused my claim and when i said i'd prefer a refund then, i was told it's too late because i took the rebooking. I called customer service today and was again told I no longer have no options and staff told me "We are not going to pay for you to get from Newark to Boston, it is not our problem. Absolutely the worst treatment I've had from an airline. They are sending myself and my 9 year old daughter to city that was not our destination and insinuated there as help options when there were not, and then essentially laughed about it. The cheap fares aren't worth being stranded in the wrong city and insulted.

### "Great budget airline"
Lisbon to Amsterdam. The Space plus seat is a good affordable seat. I've paid 7,- more for this upgrade, and it's worth it. I'm a camera operator (with a think thank airport international v3) and a manfrotto tripod. They din't make a point about anything. Seat was good, nice crew. Great budget airline. Value for money is good. That's the reason i'll give it a 7/10

### "2 luggages were missing"
San Francisco to Barcelona to find out that my 2 luggages were missing. I filled a claim and gave them my address and phone number and they never got back to me. I called Sunday, Monday, Tuesday and could not reach anyone, and no one also tried to contact me. I took a taxi and went to the airport, after almost 2 hours in the line I was able to talk to the customer service personnel, although they had no clue of the where about of my luggage.

### "We started video recording"
This morning (Xmas eve) my family and I were traveling from Rome to Amsterdam on Level. When checking in and receiving our boarding passes, we inquired whether our carry on bag size were acceptable and they said yes all is fine. When boarding, the gate agent took issue with the size of our bags and said that we needed to pay $400 to him. We explained that the airline told us they were fine and inquired why he did not think so. He refused to listen and we felt the best action was to pay and also ask for his name so we could report the incident and request refund given our bags were acceptable. When we asked his name, he refused to tell us and become agitated, saying that he would call the police, not let us board, and tell the captain of the airline that we were uncooperative. We started video recording which further angered him. He then asked for my brother’s passport and walked away with it to find a credit card machine, leaving for 5 minutes. After about 20 minutes of waiting one agent finally spoke to him and seemed to reverse his position. He gave us back our boarding passes and placed tags on our bags. We were glad to be able to make the flight but shaken by the incident. We boarded the plane and found the overhead bins to be very large and more than accommodating of our luggage, so we are unable to understand why this agent created such an incident.

### "In short look elsewhere"
Not Verified | San Francisco to Barcelona. Booked premium class travel in September 2019 for departure in December. A week before departure they call me to tell me the reservation actually did not book, even though they charge my credit card. Offered two alternative flights that would both delay our arrival to Barcelona by more than 12 hours and require at least 3 stopovers. 12 hours later they have yet to confirm the charged schedule. In short look elsewhere. No need to risk your travel plans with his airline as all they will do is take your money and ignore the reservation.

### "utter lack of customer service"
Boston to Barcelona. Because Level is a subsidiary company, if an issue arises that needs an immediate resolution for the customer, it will go unresolved because Level customer support is nonexistent and communication with Iberia has to go through the customer him/herself, and across separate computer systems (critical information is lost in translation). I was prevented from boarding due to an issue of dates in the passport before expiry (on the same flight, another family was sent home without help for the same reason, and a solo passenger was left un-helped due to a 1 letter-mismatch between the name he entered online when reserving his ticket and the name in his ID; no ground staff was able to help him!). The Level manager on shift was verbally hostile and offered no resolution, no way of communicating with Iberia to look into flight change or other solutions, and no alternative options. Only the window clerk offered sheepishly a personal suggestion and gave me a phone number to contact Iberia. When my cell phone had connectivity issues in that particular part of the airport, I was informed that Level had no phone line I could use instead to speak with Iberia. I had to borrow a cell phone from another passenger to call Iberia! Then, I was told the only option was to change my flight, which the Level staff could not do with their laptops, so for that, the Level manager had to enter a note in the system confirming I had shown up for check-in. By that time, the manager had left for the gate (before even all passengers had checked in; in other words, check-in and boarding functions overlap in time and only 1 manager covers both). The check-in clerk tried to enter a note in the computer system (despite not having the credentials for that type of annotation in the system), but that did not get registered on the Iberia end. As a consequence, Iberia was unable to change my flight, despite having telephone record of me having shown up for check-in, and I lost the ticket. This illustrates that despite the convenience of pricing, there is a risk of lost fights should any issue arise, due to the utter lack of customer service.

### "I would fly Level again"
Luton to Amsterdam in economy. Overall I had a great experience, the flight was slightly delayed due to a late arrival of the aircraft in bound. The check in and service prior to boarding was great, we were kept informed and when we did board, it was done quickly and efficiently. The aircraft are quite modern, clean and have decent legroom (I'm 202cm so I can tell every inch). The cabin staff were friendly and provided a in flight service. We made up time in the air and landed only 20 minutes late. Overall for the price I paid for the ticket and the generous cabin luggage allowed, I would fly Level again.

### "will never fly them again"
Not Verified |  Boston to Barcelona. Never have I experienced such poor communication and service from an airline. I expected bad and it just got so much worse. The flight ended up being canceled after making us wait for several hours and the crew handled everything horribly. There was no one to contact on the phone because Level customer service is nonexistent and Iberia doesn’t want to take responsibility for their budget airlines’ failures. Now 300 people are stranded for hours with no alternatives until 2 days away. Horrific- I don’t care how affordable the tickets are- they’re cheap for a reason and I will never fly them again.

### "asked where my meal and drinks were"
Newark to Paris on December 3rd. Everything went smoothly until I boarded the plane. I booked the Level Flex Bundle which allowed me to have 2 checked bags, free choice of seat, plus meal onboard along with modifications to flight and name change. When it came to dinner, only a couple of people who prepaid were given food. I asked where my meal and drinks were since I paid in advance. The stewardess told me that I was part of economy and that no free meal is provided. I proceeded to speak to her colleague, and showed him my reservation to prove that I had paid. They did not want to serve more than one drink to each passenger. When I attempted to use the front bathroom the flight manager stated that I had no right to use those toilets as it’s reserved for premium passengers.

### "value for money is incredible"
I bought a return ticket from Barcelona to Buenos Aires for 550$. Boarding was on time, stuff was polite and we had free food and snacks while on board. Chairs could have been better but there's nothing to complain about. The value for money is incredible. Thank you Level airlines.

### "slightly superior to Norwegian"
Newark to Paris Orly. I usually travel Norwegian to Europe so I'll use them as a reference. Overall, I thought the experience was slightly superior to Norwegian - check-in was quick and easy and they didn't seem quite so restrictive with baggage allowances (Norwegian adds up the total of all your carry-on to calculate if you are over the 10 kilo maximum, whereas Level didn't seem so concerned outside of your main carry-on bag). I was able to sit next to my girlfriend with no extra charge. We brought food on-board so didn't purchase anything, but the menu seemed reasonable. The seats were comfortable, the flight stress-free and flying into Orly was a plus: smaller and closer to downtown than DeGaulle. I would probably use them again based on where I'm flying to and the price.

### "confusing cabin bag rules"
Vienna to Paris. Being late for my planned flight I needed to find an alternative solution to get from Vienna to Paris. Last minute prices for Austrian and Air France began from 200 Euro, but Level cost just 130, so I took it. The website was very basic, but let me easily purchase my ticket and obtain mobile boarding pass absolutely trouble free. Their cabin bag rules are confusing. For European flights they allow 20 cm "thick" wheeled bag, but advertise intercontinental allowance which is 23 cm. Be careful since at the gate they put frame to check size and scale to check weight. Flight was delayed by 1 hr with no explanation. Gate staff (third party) were there but didn't have real time info as well. Their web site doesn't have flight status function at all. When plane finally arrived and we were able to board, it appeared to be A321, heavily used, not so heavily cleaned, with some broken tables. The legroom was generous. The plane was 1/5 full. The lights were  off during the whole flight (we landed at 9 pm). The in-flight service was the highest grade of nothing special. Explanations for the reason of delay had been never given. They made 2 passes with trolley back and fourth along the aisle in total darkness and in total silence, and that probably was an attempt of food and drink sales service (no announcement about it). I hadn't noticed anyone buying something. So in such a strange way was I able to try and test what IAG and Willy Walsh have on offer now. The good news were the legroom and the fact they saved my plans for the next day. The bad news were that with such a bizarre schedule (3 times a week at different times of the day), such prices and such a lack of in-flight service, and such confusing cabin bag rules I wouldn't be able to find a good reason to include them into my plans.

### "very rude staff"
Lisbon to Amsterdam. The plane was 1 hour late, I made a reservation in Space plus. Put my and luggage above my seat but very rude staff moved my hand luggage to another part of the plane. They were so incredibly rude I would not recommend or use this airline again.

### "don't have to offer me a refund"
Level refuses to offer refund for cancelled Gatwick to Vienna flight booked for December 2019. My flight was cancelled ("not operating" according to them) and I was re-routed onto two new flights via Barcelona. According to EU Regulation No 261/2004 as well as Vueling's Passengers' rights document (which is what is linked to from Level's website), I "shall be offered the choice between" reimbursement or re-routing. It is not a schedule change, as I've been re-routed onto two different flights with different flight numbers than my original flight. Level is insisting that it is instead a schedule change and claiming that they don't have to offer me a refund.

### "Only food for purchase was available"
Barcelona to San Francisco. This was our first flight with Iberia. First of all, our bookings were with Iberia. Imagine our surprise when we approached the Iberia desk for our boarding passes and discover that we were not flying Iberia, but another airline: Level. We were given no notification of the change beforehand even though Iberia had our contact information. We had never heard of Level Airlines, but then again, we had never been to Spain before. Our biggest complaint was that we were passed by during food service and we had no idea why. After serving other passengers, we were able to discover the problem. We had not pre-ordered food when we booked our flight. Only food for purchase was available to us. When we took advantage of this “perk”, only one selection was available. Add to this, old airplane, dirty bathrooms with sinks that didn’t drain, and attendants that were marginally interested in their jobs (except for one dear heart), it was not a top flight. Since we booked with Iberia and were not informed of the airline change, it was impossible to pre-order food on an airline we had no idea we would travel. We did not book last minute, but four months prior to our trip. Iberia had plenty of time to notify us of the change. There was no indication that food would not be served unless pre-ordered or paid when we booked the flight. A big oversight on the part of Iberia.

### "Excellent all round"
Paris to Newark. Excellent all round. Having seen some really negative comments I was concerned but on this occasion no need to be. Easy to check in on line, deposit bag and collect boarding pass. Boarding straightforward, comfortable seat and attentive cabin crew. Flight left on time and arrived early. Couldn't have been better and at a very reasonable cost too!

### "I would recommend this airline"
Not Verified |  Vienna to Amsterdam. The ticket price was really cheap so i was very glad that the airplane was very modern. The staff seemed very young but they were helpful and friendly. I had an empty seat next to me but the rest of the plane was more or less full so I was lucky. The seats were comfortable and the flight was on time. The food was good. I would recommend this airline.

### "had a really good experience"
Not Verified |  Vienna to Gatwick. I just had a really good experience with Level airline via Vueling. My EasyJet late night flight was cancelled due to problems in Gatwick and they booked us the next day for the same late night flight, where all other companies were booking for first flight. So I purchased an earlier flight via Vueling for Level. Only after did I see the reviews and freaked out! Thankfully, I had the complete opposite experience.! Staff were super polite and helpful, I called customer service who were super efficient, courteous and helped with my queries. Gatwick again cancelled the flights, but Level immediately allocated all passengers to the first flight in the morning. Again, the service was great, flight was seamless and no luggage was lost.

### "This airline is terrible"
Not Verified |  Paris Orly to Newark. This airline is terrible. Like many other reviews noted, we did not book with Level but with Iberia. Level has stranded us in Paris with no communication about next arrangements despite numerous calls to their customer service. We have booked a flight home at our expense. Iberia should reconsider their affiliation with this incompetent organization.

### "They lost my luggage"
Paris Orly to Newark. They lost my luggage, no gate agent to report it to. Finally after an hour got a bag employee to take report. Impossible to speak to a human, only take email and unresponsive. Luggage still lost and no sign of compensation. I would pay more to fly with a airline that you can speak to someone. Lesson learned!

### "they lost my baggage"
Copenhagen to Vienna. I would encourage you to try to avoid this airline as much as possible because : I traveled from Copenhagen to Vienna (VK1021 : 2nd June 2019 ) and they lost my baggage. I tried to call them several times a day for 13 days and they had no information whatsoever so I believed them and didn't try to do anything else. On 14th day by complete co-incidence I called baggage lost counter at Vienna airport to ask them about my luggage, they gave the location of my baggage and tried to solve the problem. In any case I called LEVEL again just to confirm and they said 'sorry we forgot to tell you your baggage was found in Prague'. They didn't reply nor had any more information, so I hung up the phone I knew it was a waste of time ! I am still trying to locate my baggage. I have lost a baggage before and received it with respect and compensation. I am not against airline losing stuff but in this case I want to emphasize how terrible the services are. If the customer knows more about his lost baggage than the customer care, then company is already going downhill.

### "experience was a nightmare"
Newark to Paris. My experience was a nightmare. This was primarily due to the very rude and rough behavior of the Level Airlines Team, on board, towards me and other passengers. They were extremely rude, would not stop to ask passengers such as me if I wanted to buy something to eat or drink, would not reply when talked to. One of the hostesses ran her trolley into my foot and did not apologise until I insisted ; another Airhostess was putting her elbow almost into my face while I was asleep in order to serve a passenger their pre-booked meal behind me, this woke me up and she refused to answer when I asked her politely if she could move the trolley up a little, finally after I asked 4 times in 2 different languages, she said no, she would not move the trolley and told me "there is no need to be unpleasant. Seats are poor quality with thin cushioning, very little leg space, they provide no headphones, and bundles it into a 16 USD package, same with blankets etc. The airline accepts payment in EUR or Credit card, does not accept USD.

### "it was one of the worst flights"
Not Verified |  Barcelona to San Francisco. We were originally supposed to fly on Iberia and were put on a Level flight, it was one of the worst flights ever. Attendants were rude, they didn't have much food on board, you had to literally grab an attendant to get anything, their credit card machine worked about half of the time, when asked for water they told my daughter to go to the back of the plane and get it herself. The attendants did not speak English, and on and on. All the announcements were in Spanish so you did not know what was going on.

### "recommend highly this airline"
Not Verified |  Paris to Montreal. Excellent. Brand new aircrafts. Very happy. One of the best airlines I have seen. Even their safety movie is different, fun and modern. I recommend highly this airline.

### "customer service was unacceptable"
Newark to Paris. Do not fly with Level. The airline canceled our flight and the customer service following the cancellation and trying to get a resolution to all of the problems it has caused to our travel plans has been deplorable. The soonest Level would rebook us on an outbound flight was four days later, and then Level canceled that flight too, meaning the soonest they could accommodate us was five days after we were originally supposed to fly. They ruined our vacation and we weren't able to travel at all. Level's customer service was unacceptable during the entire process. The night of the cancellation, clueless airport staff kept people standing around for hours trying to figure out what to do. All they kept saying was we had to call the customer service phone number, which was closed. It's ridiculous that customer service phone lines are not staffed at the times flights are operating to handle these issues. It took more than two hours before staff was even able to start providing hotel rooms, and then even then, there were not enough hotel rooms for all of the impacted passengers. Level airport staff were terrible at communicating information during the whole process. Level airport staff told passengers who weren't able to get a hotel room to find their own way to their accommodation and then the airline would reimburse them for any costs. Nope. Contacted Level after the fact and they continue to give us the runaround and try to weasel out of providing the reimbursement (which is required by EU regulations when the airline cancels a flight). More than a month later and they have still not done anything to resolve the issue. Then when we submitted a claim for the cancellation compensation we were entitled to under the EU 261 air passenger rights regulations, Level fabricated some story about the cancellation being due to "extraordinary circumstances" to weasel out of providing the compensation as required by the law, yet they have ignored multiple requests to provide documentation/substantiation of their claim of "extraordinary circumstances", as required by the European regulations. Every time you try to contact Level "customer service" they just copy and paste some irrelevant form reply and don't actually read or do anything about the issue you e-mailed them about. Avoid Level at all costs. It is not worth the risk and frustration to get burnt by their terrible customer service. Just think, if they stranded you in your destination city away from home for five days or more, not lifting a finger to help you during the process. It's worth the extra money to fly with a real airline instead.

### "had 3 seats all to myself"
Vienna to Gatwick. The plane was new, and very comfortable inside. I was very pleased to see that changing my seat at the last minute had worked, as I now had 3 seats all to myself. Once onboard, we were told that due to fog at Gatwick, there will be a 2 hour slot delay. To their credit, the cabin crew came around handing out glasses of water, and started a round with the trolleys, coming round and offering us things to Purchase. I bought a packet of crisps and a glass of wine, and was very impressed with the relatively low price. Once we finally got airborne, they did another round of service. The crew were  kind and professional. Another benefit is that they have USB charge points at every seat on the A321s. We landed at Gatwick just under 2 hours late, but that was not the fault of the airline. Many flights on Level are very cheap, and if the price is right, I would not hesitate to use them again.

### "had no flight that night"
We thought we were getting a great deal, but if it looks too good to be true, it probably is. A few days after we bought the tickets, Level contacted us: "We regret to inform you that your flight will not operate as planned. The in-bound flight was going to get into New York much too late and we asked to fly out the next day at a more reasonable hour. We had to call several times before getting someone who was willing to help. And  then we learned that Level does not have flights every day so we'd have to leave several days later. So we asked to change the return date as well. We did not want our stay to be shortened. Once again, we had to call several times until someone was willing to accommodate us. And that doesn't even count the number of times we called where we waited for 15-20 minutes just to be told that all the lines are busy, please call back later. We originally bought the tickets in February, and our new itinerary was finally confirmed just days before our departure - the 3rd week in April. The actual flight was more or less uneventful, but you need to be aware that you have to pay for everything - checking in a bag, a meal, even water is not free. In fact, while we were checking in on-line we were told over the phone that there are a limited number of free random seats and we will have to pay for a seat. I said, "forget it, we'll stand. She was not amused and said we will have to pay for our seats. Level flights depart from Newark at 10:40pm to go to Paris. However, exceptionally (it was never explained why the time change) our return flight on May 3rd would leave at 00.20. On May 3rd, we arrived at Newark at 9pm. Much to our surprise, Level had no scheduled flight that night, no agents were anywhere to be found and the customer service number was not available at that time. In the meantime we had to spend hundreds of euros to extend our stay in New York. We had to wait until 3AM to reach a customer service representative to find out what was going on. We were informed that we were supposed to check in on the evening of May 2nd to fly out at 00.20 (which is May 3rd). The only solution they offered were to reimburse the tax - the first supervisor told us it was 230 euros, but the second supervisor said it would only be 75 euros). When we demanded to speak to another supervisor we were told that there weren't any other supervisors at this time that spoke English, only Catalan. An agent got on the phone and spoke Spanish. We explained the  situation, he apologized (the only agent to apologize) and said he would need 72 hours to rectify the situation. In the meantime the supervisor invited us to purchase new tickets to fly out a couple of days later for $1900 (for 2 adults / 1 child) with the hopes of getting reimbursed.

### "the worst airline"
Boston to Barcelona. I work in the industry and Level is the worst airline I have ever seen. The gate agents were completely incompetent. They had no idea how to manage boarding the aircraft. There was a pileup of passengers at the bottom of the Logan Terminal E boarding escalator that was extremely dangerous as a result of their incompetence. Then we sat on the plane for two hours while we were told there was a mechanical problem. Two hours later, we were told that the flight was cancelled and were marched aimlessly around the terminal. Apparently the agents had no idea how to get back to the ticketing hall. When we finally got back to ticketing , the agents told us to sit around until they could figure out what to do. This was all at 1:00 in the morning. After another hour, we were told that the flight was cancelled and we would receive an email about our options. Needless to say, the email never came and to add insult to injury, Level then refused to refund our tickets and the $100 they charged for my checked bag. I honestly don’t know how the people who run this ponzi scheme of an airline sleep at night.

### "mess of an airline"
Boston to Barcelona with Level. The Spirit Airlines of international travel. That should say enough. You will never regret not flying this mess of an airline and more certainly will regret it if you do fly with this airline. Why Iberia associates it's name with this outfit is baffling.

### "trip was a bad experience"
Barcelona to Santiago de Chile. The trip was a bad experience, they didn't serve any food or drink and they didn't let this know with you just when we were already on the plain. I never had a 15 hours transatlantic flight without some basic service of food or beverages. When we finally bought some food for a lot of money, was very bad and  service was very slow. When we ordered the second time, they forgot, and after 30 minutes I had to ask again, after wait another 30 minutes. Blankets and pillows were also not free, you could purchase them. By the way, the staff was nice, just busy and unprofessional.

### "a lot of work to do to"
Not Verified |  San Francisco to Barcelona. On the positive side Level has excellent prices and the food is not bad. The seats even in Premium economy are too hard for a long transatlantic flight so, bring an inflatable cushion. The return flight is painfully slow (about an hour plus longer than other airlines), I am guessing this is to to save fuel. Having stated the positive elements of LEVEL I must say it is clearly a poorly run airlines. When you call the US number you are given 4 options to press but when you press option 4 (other), you are sent back in an unending loop, in other words, you can't get to option 4. If you are able to reach a recording you are then told that agents are only available up to 1:00 AM Central European time and the conversation is terminated without saying good-bye. Good luck trying to reserve seats early. My LEVEL documents tell me that I can reserve seats early by going to an IBERIA web site and enter a special reference number printed on my documents unfortunately, that number is not recognized by Iberia. After calling Iberia I am told a couple of wrong information but finally I am told that it is not possible to reserve seats early. So, good prices, food not too bad, but everything else clearly indicates that management has a lot of work to do to improve the quality of their service.

### "don’t care if you complain"
Not Verified | Vienna to Mallorca. The first time I fly with this airline and for sure this will be the last. The first impression is the Check-in service. At the counter I think these ladies don’t like their work there. The service is very poor that they don’t even care if you complain. It shows only that they are used to customers complaining. Anyway that’s what you get from a cheap airline, a cheap staff also! This unprofessional staff is in Vienna. In addition they said the plane is full that‘s why they cannot make any changes. The plane wasn't full. But on our way back, Staff in Palma de Mallorca is very accommodating and friendly.

### "without free food or water"
Not Verified |  I am a seasoned traveler and have never crossed the Atlantic without free food or water being offered! A full plane from Boston to Barcelona and not a sip of water offered. When a passenger in front of me asked why he had not been offered a beverage the flight attendant told him he must have been asleep. I was awake and they moved right past me too. The worst cabin service ever! Never fly this airline again.

### "reservation is not valid"
Paris Orly to Fort de France. I booked our Easter holidays trip at "cheap" price back in November 2018, and when 2 weeks before the departure date I wanted to check-in a bag, - I found out that my reservation is not valid / was canceled, in spite of receiving a booking confirmation, with booking reference, a reference to a successful payment, etc. Two days of calling and emailing with the customer support result in zero progress. we are waiting for a decision from the head office, and can not do anything at the moment", and the only "solution" offered is to buy the tickets again, - at the current rates, at least twice expensive.

### "having to buy a meal"
Definitely would not recommend booking through this airline. Just flew from Barcelona to San Francisco on an 11 hr flight without any food or drinks provided free (which I did not know until I boarded the plane). I ended up having to buy a meal which came cold after everyone else was done and the lights had been turned down. The crew staff were incredibly unprofessional. I had an aisle seat, and they kept ramming into my arm even with the many times that I tried to scoot myself in the seat. On top of that, they were loudly talking to each other in the back of the cabin which made it incredibly hard to get any rest. At one point in the flight, someone had opened a nail polish and started painting their nails. The crew staff behind me saw it (and probably smelled it) but did not do anything about it. All in all, the money you’ll save booking a flight with Level is not worth it. Book somewhere else.

### "services were unavailable"
Barcelona to Boston. The good: safe flight, seats are comfortable, they have TVs The bad: no  beverage service and no warning of no beverage service. That doesn't stop them from running up and down the aisles with water for the people who paid for this. The inflight services were unavailable. wifi - who cares, but to order a meal or a beverage, you had to call a FA. Often with disappointing results - waited 40 minutes for curried chicken. Some of the FA treated the little folks like me with an attitude - like when I asked after 30 minutes if my meal was coming. We waited 15 minutes on the first bus to go to the plane. This was after a preboarding process that had us in line 25 minutes before the boarding time. Keeping people hydrated on an 8 hour flight should be a basic right.

### "I was extremely disappointed"
I was extremely disappointed with this airline. I booked a flight from Barcelona to San Francisco through Iberia. I got a cheap deal through EDreams,  a booking agency. At the end the price was deceiving as it went from 485€ to 600€, no luggage included (only carry-on). As I was making the queue to board, someone asked the staff member who checks the boarding pass if he had food included, I thought that was pretty obvious, it is a 13hr flight after all! So I asked as well and they said no! I went to buy a sandwich and a salad in a Café nearby before I boarded the plane. So to my surprise the aircraft is not from Iberia but from Level, I was confused but ok. The seats were tiny, they barely bend backwards and overall they are extremely uncomfortable, definitely not suited for such a long flight. They had no WiFi due to technical issues, if it were functioning though, you would have to pay like 8$ the hour. Crew members were overall not very professional and rude, you do not get a single smile and they do not ask you if you are ok. They would only care for those who had paid for the food (which btw, did not appear as an option as I booked the flight, total rip-off). They did not offer one single cup of water, nothing, just rude looks. I could barely sleep because of the uncomfortable seat. On my way back to Barcelona, again Level, same story. Only that this time the woman at the check-in told me I had the food included. Because I am very wise, I asked again by the boarding gate just in case and they told me no, I have no meals included in my flight. Again I had to go and buy a meal at the airport. Same  aircraft, same rude staff, just dreadful. Do yourself a favor and never book Level, and beware of Iberia, as you might be actually booking with Level.

### "plane took off without me"
Newark to Paris. I wish I read the reviews before purchasing my flight with LEVEL. This airline is a total scam! Their business model is to lure people in with their inexpensive pricing, do not deliver and then deny all responsibilities. Before my flight, LEVEL sent me an email to ask me to check-in online. I did and was provided an eboarding pass. Little did I know, that the eboarding pass I was provided is faulty and did not work when I was going through airport security. At this point, I was unable to find any person working for LEVEL to help me. I tried called the 1800 number, and was shocked that the office is closed for the day! (what legit airline does not have a 24-hr hotline?) So basically, I saw the plane took off without me even though I arrived 3.5hrs before my flight. There was another guy that was stranded just like me, who cannot even find the LEVEL counter to check-in! And he drove all the way to Newark from PA! I ended up spending so much more money buying a last min flight, traveling for 2 days without sleep to get to my Paris work meeting on time. When I tried to make a claim to LEVEL, they denied all responsibilities and did not once address their faulty eticket. This is flying budget at an expensive cost!

### "2 cancelations within 2 weeks"
My flight was canceled, as well as the one on the way to Martinique. So 2 cancelations within 2 weeks. Was trying to get the compensation from the airline but they refuse to confirm the real cause of both cancelations. They gave me a paper with technical issue reason and then tried to get out with weather reasons. Very bad experience with client service. No communication at all. Still wating (over 30 days) for their response to my other claim from canceled flight. Not helpful at all in fulfilling the contract between us. So be aware. Cheap airline with a very bad service. Their planes are brand new though.

### "worst trip I ever had"
Buenos Aires to Brussels via Barcelona. This was the worst trip I ever had. I booked a €940 single flight with Iberia and when I check in I see that the flight is operated by level. Turns out Economy means no inflight catering (unless ordered online with extra payment - which I wasn’t informed of) and almost no inflight entertainment. The chairs were not leather, extremely hard and no leg space. This was a 12,5hr long flight. How is this possible or even legitimate? This is a total rip-off. If I had known I would have never booked that flight.

### "stay well away"
Not Verified |  Gatwick to Vienna. Purchased priority boarding at both London Gatwick & Vienna however they proceeded to provide everyone who didn't purchase the opportunity of putting their luggage into the hold for free and with that provided them priority boarding. I understand that it is sometimes required to put luggage into the hold however people who have paid extra money for specific services should be allowed to board first however this was not provided. Customer service is very rude and unhelpful - quoting EU Regulations which have nothing to do with it it's basic consumer rights, services were not provided. Horrific airline stay well away.

### "so helpful to me"
Vienna to Gatwick. When I flew to Austria from Gatwick there were some issues with my luggage, which was my fault, and the staff at the check in counter were so helpful to me. When I flew back on Friday 21st there was chaos at Gatwick because of the drones and the airport in Vienna messed the data up of the flight (they said it was cancelled when it wasn't) and still we were able to fly off and get to Gatwick. I am so grateful for this airline. So thank you!

### "showcased a lack of ethics"
I purchased a return ticket Newark to Paris Orly with paid 1 check-in luggage on each sector. I had successfully pre-checked in 24 hours prior to departure & printed my boarding pass at home. When I arrived at the airline counter at EWR 3 hours before my flight departure, the ticketing agent received an error message on her computer resulting to her not being able to print my luggage tag & an actual boarding pass. The check-in agent then proceeded to verify that my passport is still valid, that my tickets were valid, that I was cleared to fly by the border control & airport security both in USA and France and I was not in the no-fly-list. The check-in agent then referred the matter to her supervisor, and even the supervisor was unable to resolve the matter. The supervisor then confirmed that it was negligence on the airline's part and that Level has a bug in their check-in system and all this is not my fault at all. At that time, we had already passed the closing time for check-in and there was no way that I, nor my check-in luggage could make the flight in time. The supervisor then took screen shots of the system error on her computer & emailed the Level Airline Manager in Paris. Due to time zone difference, the Manager was not able to reply her promptly, so she told me to go home and wait for a reply from the Manager. The next day I was told that the Manager could not guarantee that they can fix the bug in their system in time for me to board onto their next flight which was the next day, and also my flight back from ORY to EWR. I was advised to purchase a new return flight ticket to Paris with a different airline and claim a full refund of my Level ticket and my airport transportation costs. I then successfully purchased and traveled to Paris with a different low cost airline, and now back to NYC without any problems. Level have replied my emails, but unfortunately they are telling me that they take no responsibility that I wasn't able to make their flight and that my claims cannot be honored. This was their reply "For future reference, we would like to remind you that you have the option of checking in online and printing out your boarding pass in advance. You can do this by following the steps on the page “Check-in Online” of our website. In light of all of the above, and having complied with European regulation 261/2004, we regret informing you that your request can unfortunately not be honored. Seriously what kind of response is that? Does not makes sense at all, I was at the check-in counter 3 hours before departure and even if I have my boarding pass with me, they could not even print out my check-in luggage tag which I paid for? And all this is my fault? I emailed them again saying that they must have not understood my case and that they should investigate my case properly, to please clarify all proof and reports by the EWR supervisor and Level Manager before claiming that this incident is entirely my fault, as if to escape their responsibilities as the airline contracted to take me to Paris at the agreed time. Their reply: "Following our resolution to your case in our previous e-mail, we proceeded to revise this case and have verified that our company has complied at all times with our Conditions of Carriage and the current European air travel regulation. Once again, we regret not being able to honor your request: Seriously, this airline has showcased a lack of ethics, empathy, and integrity at a stunning level!

### "carry-on allowance of 12 kg"
Paris Orly to Montréal. Check in staff was rude. Nowhere on the Level website does it say that there is a carry-on baggage weight allowance of 12 kg, which the Swissport staff apply strictly. Not even showing them the website, checking the terms and conditions - nowhere written. Good points : great staff, great entertainment, plane brand new.

### "we asked for ticket refund"
Milan to Vienna. We Made an error with a passenger birth date within 24 hours! And I know that is possible change the details within in the next 24 h. But Level and the agency kiwi.com forced us to buy a new ticket because they told us that it was not possible change the birth date! we did not want to have problems so we took another ticket and we later discover that the flight was empty! So we understand the fraud and we asked for ticket refund! No one helped us, They don’t want to refund us and they don’t even want to refund taxes! Moreover it was not possible to do the check in online, the system said that seat for free check-in were finished! Once we were on board we discovered the plane was empty! Another way to force you to select and buy a seat for doing the check in at home!

### "Would not recommend"
Barcelona to Los Angeles. The first time I was ignored the entire flight. They will not serve you a glass of water unless you buy it. Every item you wanted or needed had to be bought at outrages prices including blankets, headsets, water, coffee and so on. They used Iberia airplane with minimal leg room. The crew service was terrible. The cost of each baggage checked in $50. To get to the airplane in Barcelona we had to ride a very crowded bus, and boarding process was very unorganized. Would not recommend this airline.

### "cabin crew very helpful"
Vienna to Milan. Best low cost airline. The plane was very clean, cabin crew very helpful. Plane has nice interior, the flight was almost empty (about 40-60 passengers). Friendly cheap fares and good legroom and USB port for mobile charging.

### "forget complaining"
Montréal to Paris, a Level flight operated by Openskies. I contacted them before flying to check-in one luggage. They told me I could only do it at the airport (which was wrong) and then they gave me a wrong price. At the airport I was asked double the price. I called them back, they told me that I was right to fill in a complaint (because their agent made a mistake and they recorded it) but I had to do it through their website. The website wasn't working well, after spending an hour I finally managed to fill in my complaint. A month and a half later I had no answer. I tried to access my complaint online, it didn't work. I called them : no agent can check the status of my complaint, or even take my name or complaint number. the complaint department doesn't talk to customers. They tell me that if I didn't have an answer it is because my complaint was rejected. What kind of company doesn't even reply to its customer when themselves do a mistake? Since there are no ways to contact the complaint service, they tell me to write a new complaint,  what a joke! I would have to write a new one on their non-working website and get no answer again if they decide it doesn't apply to their criteria. And nobody in person would never get to check my complaint status anyways. So if you get any trouble with Iberia, forget complaining.

### "delayed on our flights"
Barcelona to Oakland. I originally booked with this airline because of the good prices for the flights. But I now regret this decision after being delayed on our outward and return flights. After reviewing this airline on the internet I have come to realize that this seems to be a regular occurrence with this airline. In the future I will definitely avoid this airline.

### "Level is the stingiest"
Barcelona to Boston. Of all the cheap airlines I've flown, Level is the stingiest - you don't even get a cup of water to drink, let alone meals or snacks. Be sure to bring anything you want to eat or drink on a long flight, or be prepared to pay airport prices for food that's nearly indigestible. The dish called "chicken curry with rice" tasted like recycled paper. Cabin staff ignore you. We writhed in our seats trying to get comfortable but no luck sleeping on this long flight. On the positive side, our trans-Atlantic flight arrived half an hour early.

### "late 2 hours 55 minutes"
Vienna to Milan. They play with the delay, on both my routes they were late. VIE to MXP was late 2 hours 55 minutes, not surprisingly as EU rules say over 3 hours the company has to reimburse and compensate customers.

### Level customer review
This was my first experience with Level / Iberia and it was the worst flying experience. The flight to Barcelona, unlike our return flight, was not completely terrible. Pros: we departed and arrived on time, our bags arrived intact, and the entertainment options onboard were great. The WiFi was mediocre, but that’s pretty common on most international flights. Cons: the flight attendants were hands down the rudest I have ever encountered. This is the only airline I have encountered that does not provide you with one glass of water on a 12 hour flight unless you request it and pay $5 for it. The return flight was a  disaster. We arrived at the airport in Barcelona almost three hours before our departure time. We were unable to complete our check in online due to a computer error. We had a bag to check anyway, so we figured we’d just do it at the airport. However, when we arrived, the check in line was incredibly long and just got longer after our arrival. The line moved unbelievably slow. No one knew why. There were 5 attendants checking people in - all of them for our flight. They were each taking an average of 10 minutes to check in each party. After an hour of this and having hardly moved in the line, I went to front to find out what was going on and if we were going to make the flight. Found out that the computer error was universal and that no one could check in online. But the fact that this was not communicated to any of us in line made for a very tense situation. I was later told by another passenger in line that an attendant had told her they would hold the flight until everyone had checked in and gotten on board. But they never changed the flight departure time, and as it got increasingly closer to departure time, we all grew more and more worried. Add to this that the airport had poor air conditioning. After over 2.5 hours in line, we finally got checked in. The attendant told us that she hoped we made the flight, but to run, because it was departing in 10 minutes. And we still needed to get through security. So we ran. At the gate? We are trying to hold the flight for you. Please hurry.” Once through, then wait in an shuttle bus with 40 sweating passengers to take you to another terminal to the plane. Rushed and pushed by employees and still left an hour late. Once on board, rude attendants unwilling to help with finding carryon space. Onboard no WiFi, completely broken. Freezing cold airplane, even with two sweatshirts on, but you could buy a $15 blanket if you wanted. Broken food ordering system. No one to collect trash. Then yelled at for leaving it on the floor. And they lost our luggage.

### "tickets were in fact suspended"
I was amazed by the prices - $280 round trip from Boston to Barcelona. However they have managed to charge me multiple times, and I will never fly with them again. First - I booked my flights on Level.com in January. I received confirmation, saw the appropriate charges on my credit card, no problem. Then four days later, a mysterious charge appeared on my card for $291 USD from Iberia with no associated ticket number. I called them, but they had no record of charging me this money and suggested I call my bank to have the charge reversed. I called my bank and they were able to get me the money back in a few weeks. Good thing I checked my statement carefully, but this is unacceptable. The day before departure, I decided to add a checked bag for $44 USD online. Got an email from LEVEL confirming that I had paid the baggage fee, and brought a copy of this email to the Boston airport. When I arrived, I was told that LEVEL could not honor this because the confirmation email that I had received didn't include a record number or barcode. They made me pay again, $55 this time, to check my bag. They told me they could not reimburse my original paid fee, and that I would need to speak with the Iberia agents in Barcelona. I tried to do that once I arrived, and they directed me to call LEVEL customer service and get it sorted out. I decided to wait until I returned from my vacation to get my money back. I went to check in online for my return flight to Boston, after receiving the standard 'time to check in' email. Except my booking said I couldn't check in online. Okay, whatever, I go to the airport and check in. When I arrive, I'm told that my ticket was suspended because I never paid for it! I pull up all of my confirmation emails, the check-in email, the listing on 'My Bookings' on the LEVEL website, and even my credit card statements. All of this this clearly demonstrates that I have booked and paid for this flight months ago, and was never told that there was any issue with my payment or anything. If I want to go home, I'll need to pay for this ticket again, at the same $140 (one-way) price plus a $25 fee for booking it at the airport. I am livid about this but I needed to get home, so I bite the bullet and pay for the same ticket again. As soon as I arrive back in Boston I get on the phone with them to get my money back. I am told that I need to call my bank and get the charge in January for the original ticket cancelled. This seems incredibly sketchy to me - why can't they refund me directly, given that they have plenty of documentation that I had paid for the original ticket?! They provide me with some documentation that the tickets were in fact suspended. So I call my bank. My bank is also shocked that Iberia is refusing to refund me directly, since there's no real dispute here - they charged my card, they issued me a confirmation, and then they didn't honor my ticket. However, thankfully they are able to open a dispute and I am hoping that with their help I'll be able to get my money back. I will avoid them like the plague from now on.

### "exhausting and frustrating process"
I have encountered multiple problems with Level's customer service. Their processing payment system is extremely delayed. I received no confirmation that a flight was booked until a transaction showed up on my credit card several days later. Save yourself the misery of being passed around by their customer service and the multiple calls you will have to make to hopefully get a refund. Excuses consist of “system isn’t working", " the supervisor is only here from 6am-3pm, "the supervisor is only here from 8am-3pm". I was sporadically hung up on. When I asked to review them. I was not given a website. I was told its too late for a refund. Even though I called in the 24 hour period. I booked a flight on 9/8 from EWR to Paris return. Two separate one way tickets for my boyfriend and I. Great deal $306 for both tickets per person. I did not receive a confirmation form my flight from EWR - ORY. I called Level for help. Their staff is all Spanish speaking. No one can quickly and concisely help you if you are speaking English. On 4/8/18 I called Iberia for help. A man instructed me that the purchase did not go through and to re purchase the ticket. I called my bank and confirmed that the purchase did not go through. I re purchased again. The man insured I would be reimbursed if the charge appeared on my account later. I repurchased the ticket through the man with Iberia. I Still did not receive confirmation that this ticket was purchased until 2 days later. If you use their website to confirm the booking - good luck by my tickets never showed up under “my booking”. This time two transactions showed up on my card 2 days later. April 13th two more charges appeared. I decided to cancel the flights on April  8th in the 24 hour period. I canceled because of the additional time and cost it would take to get from home city to EWR. This cancelation was made less than 12 hours form the original purchase. I called on 4/8/18. The man could only see one of the tickets purchased. He was supposed to cancel the flight with the purchase that went though. He said refund would be made in anywhere from 5-30 days? 5 - 30 days?! They should know when a refund will be made! It is APRIL 20th and I am still yet to receive a refund for the ticket from PARIS- EWR. For $314 dollars. I called on 4/18/18. Agent was able to help me get a refund for the $148 that appeared on my bank statement on April 13th. I received and email with the refund receipt that same day I called April 18th. However the refund was for the incorrect amount. I then received a random $97 from Iberia. The refund receipt has no details or information on it. So I do not know where this $97 dollars is coming from! I am awaiting a call from the supervisor to find out why I have not received this refund. I have never called probably 10 times. This is the most exhausting and frustrating process I have ever went though with a company.

### "I will recommend the airline"
Barcelona to Los Angeles. I was very impressed with Level. We flew to Barcelona on Norwegian and returned on Level. I think that they really got things right with Level. The flight was on-time. The cabin crew was friendly, elegantly dressed and service was excellent. As the result of a recent fall I have a fractured disk and the gate agent went out of his way to find a seat with more legroom and did not charge me although I would have been happy to pay for the upgrade. We did not order the meal service because the a la carte menu was excellent and fairly priced. In-flight entertainment was very good as well. The only negative I can think of for this flight was that the one hour of wifi that I ordered went down after 15 minutes so I will try to get a refund. Baggage handling was excellent. I will fly Level again next year as we hope to go back to Spain to visit family and I will recommend the airline to our friends and family in that country.
