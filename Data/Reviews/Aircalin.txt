### "deeply disappointed with the service"
I am deeply disappointed with the service and management of Air Calin. Recently, I experienced a significant issue where I was cheated out of AUD 1000. The handling of this matter by the airline's staff was unprofessional and unacceptable. The lack of transparency and accountability displayed by Air Calin's management team has left me feeling frustrated and disrespected. As a customer, I expected a higher standard of service and integrity.

### "messing around with passenger's itineraries"
The in-flight experience in Aircalin is quite decent. Friendly bi-lingual cabin crew, decent enough food and drinks, and a nice cabin overall. Where my experience really fell apart was the constant changes in flight times. I flew from Singapore to Noumea, then Noumea to Port Vila, before flying back to Singapore the same way. First there were minor half hour adjustments a few weeks after booking. This, in itself, is fine. Then my Noumea to Port Vila leg was rescheduled 2 weeks before departure, and I had to change my tickets because it was no longer possible to catch that flight (it took off before I landed in Noumea). Then (and this is most disappointing), my flight from Port Vila to Noumea got substantially changed just 4 days before departure. I was supposed to fly from Port Vila to Noumea at 10pm on a Monday night, so I would have spent the full day resting by the beach before heading to the airport and catching my flight. I would have then caught another flight to Singapore 1.5 hours later, having a swift but efficient transit in Noumea. The flight to Noumea got pulled forward to 11am in the morning, and thus, I spent the last day of my holiday sitting around in Noumea airport. No attempt at improving the situation was provided, and as we couldn't check our bags all the way through, me and other passengers on this itinerary were stuck at the airport all day lugging our suitcases around. No meaningful attempt at improving this situation was made by Aircalin. This is where the Aircalin experience really fell apart for me. I booked and paid to spend the last day of my holiday relaxing by the beach, then catching a night flight to Noumea, a swift layover, and a subsequent flight to Singapore. Instead, I had to wake up early to catch my flight to Noumea and spend my entire day at the airport. These 2 experiences are entirely different and considering the fact that I booked the 1st experience, it is not acceptable that I was stuck with the 2nd, with no meaningful recourse. The first experience is high-value and efficient, while the second experience is more reflective of a budget itinerary. As an airline, once you create a schedule, you should stick to it. Constantly changing the schedule, and messing around with passenger's itineraries is an easy way to leave a sour taste in their mouth, even if the inflight experience is decent.

### "A shame of airline"
Not Verified |  A shame of airline. They have lost my luggage (same for 2 more colleagues) in august and I am still waiting for a refund (21/05/2023). They don't answer my mails and I had to pay to a lawyer to try to solve this issue. For me, the worst company ever

### "Excellent onboard service"
Fantastic flight. Despite a delay departing Narita due to weather, I really enjoyed my flight on Air Calin. The crew were fantastic - very friendly and helpful. Excellent onboard service, great food, a very comfortable seat and the cabin was clean. I would fly them again.

### "they're proving to be unreliable"
Not Verified |  This review is written from the viewpoint of not actually being able to fly AirCalin, despite wanting to. One of my favourite airlines pre-Covid but right now, they're proving to be unreliable. A real shame. Booked my ticket through Air NZ utilising the AirCalin operated flight for a late afternoon flight home on Thursday 27th April, arriving early evening. And why not? A nice leisurely morning a swim at the beach before lunch, then heading to the airport. A pretty decent early dinner onboard with a good red for the 2 hour flight. Sounds good right? But AirCalin has other ideas. First flight reschedule received was to Friday (28/4) morning at 9 o'clock. Not exactly stellar having to leave the hotel at 5 am but ok, I'll just book another night at hotel. Now today, one week from holiday, the Friday flight has been cancelled outright and rebooked on Air NZ (still pretty good but lacking that certain je ne sais quoi these days). Two things grate. I now miss a friend's wedding on Saturday afternoon and I need to schlep my bag to another hotel (since the other hotel is now full on the Friday night). A shemozzle but at least Air NZ have rebooked flights, veg meal and seat selection without drama on the Saturday lunchtime flight. Thanks AirCalin for messing me about, not once but twice. If and when independence from France eventuates, AirCalin won't be able to hide behind Paris' largesse. It'll need to stand and deliver. That'll be interesting.

### "service throughout exceptional"
Not Verified | When cabin crew ask for your feedback and thoughts on how they could improve you know they are genuinely committed to improving service. To be honest I could not fault them on our 2 hour 40mins flight. The plane was fairly new, very clean and the welcome aboard and service throughout exceptional. I had to compliment the crew on the food. The steak was perfect and tasted as if it had been cooked on-board. It bettered my steak experience from steak cooked on board in first class! I really look forward to flying Aircalin again and experiencing that level of customer service and care. Highly recommended

### "Absolute rubbish service"
Absolute rubbish service today at the start and the end. Check in line for economy was huge. I had a Qantas ticket (codeshare) and am Platinum with Qantas so attempted to use the premium queue, which was not permitted. Despite not having clients, premium Check-in desks were not servicing economy clients, preferring to chat amongst themselves. Flight was ok. On arrival, no carousel information and bags took over 30 mins to commence delivery. A PA on ‘we’re sorry for late delivery and miss communication’ really doesn’t equate to being a reasonable service. I won’t fly Air Calin again.

### "Surprisingly very good"
Melbourne to Nouméa. Surprisingly very good airline and good business seat for a three hours flight. Very good staff and very good product in business. Among them: Nikko Japanese whisky!

### "an appreciable flight"
Noumea to Tokyo in economy and it was a good experience for a 8:30 hrs flight. The crew was warm and welcoming. The seat was comfortable with a lot of space for my legs and the entertainment system was complete. However the A330 cabin looked quiet old but these aircraft have to be replaced by mid 2019. The food was correct but not exceptional. Overall it was an appreciable flight.

### "beware buying a fully refundable ticket"
Nadi to Noumea. Aircalin is the only airline I have ever flown that does not allow for baby strollers, car seats or cots to be checked in without paying for additional luggage. Also beware when buying a fully refundable ticket. It is nearly impossible to cancel a flight on Aircalin. You can’t do it on line and you can’t do it over the phone. You can only do it in writing and then, if you are lucky, you may receive the refund 30 days later.

### "provided a good service"
Flew Nadi, Fiji to Wallis Island. Aircalin is the flag carrier of New Caledonia and although a small airline, provided a good service. There were no boarding problems and the flight was on time. This was a very short flight and the cabin service was appropriate.

### "never fly again with this airline"
Noumea to Fiji. We arrived at Noumea airport at 10 am to be told that our 1pm flight was cancelled due to ash cloud from Port Villa over Fiji. Other planes resumed flying at 10.20am. Aircalin had already cancelled our flight and had no re-scheduled flight? How can you cancel a flight before the scheduled time? We had to return the next day at our cost to be redirected to Brisbane and then to Fiji with a 9 hour wait in Brisbane. There were only 10 passengers on the original flight that was cancelled and not re-scheduled. Will never fly again with this airline.

### Aircalin customer review
Sydney to Noumea. We had a very poor experience at check in, the lady was rude and did not even care to greet us or wish us a safe flight. I’m not sure what her excuse was for it but she was condescending and it really put us off right at the start of our vacation. Our toddler was trying to grab her attention to greet her, and she did not even acknowledge her.

### "on time flights"
Flew from Nouméa to Ile Des Pins. Only domestic airline in New Caledonia, you have to accept their rules. Maximum weight for cabin luggage 3 kg (accepted up to 5kg, everything included), check-in luggage max 12 kg. Check-in is only allowed 80 mn before departure. No service is offered on board. However we flew on brand new, clean ATRs, with friendly staff, on time flights, and quick delivery of our luggage.

### "be wary if you need to cancel"
This is the flight and holiday we were planning to go on but due to illness and then unfortunately death of a family member, we chose to cancel our trip. The staff at Aircalin were great and informative saying that it would take between 6-8 weeks to process. We understood that, no problem. It has now been 12 weeks and we have seen no refund. I have called and emailed them numerous times and they are lovely and very polite, but I seem to be getting nowhere with information as to why this is taking so long. Just be wary if you need to cancel a flight for whatever reason.

### "superb full course French meal"
A perfect flight with Aircalin from Tokyo to Noumea. Departure on time. Cocktail served just after take off, followed by a superb full course French meal. Complimentary French wines are very good even if not grand cru. And most of all the crew are friendly, efficient and professional.

### "service was perfect"
Kansai to Noumea on Aircalin. Boarding was long : we were called to queue and than we were standing 15 minutes before gate opened. Onboard service was perfect. Food was good. If you want to sleep, the seat is not flat but was acceptable.

### "terrible breakfast"
On the journey from Auckland to Noumea lunch was served which was tasty. The seats are very uncomfortable with very little padding in the back so you feel every movement of the passenger behind you. No Entertainment but this was fine for a short trip. Service was good and cabin crew were pleasant. On the return journey from Noumea checkin was very slow and took far too long. Breakfast was served on this flight and it was terrible. It consisted of a grey omelette which looked so unappetisng no one around me ate it. Also served was a bread roll and croissant which were fine. Overall the flights were fine but the terrible breakfast served up on the flight home was so disappointing.

### "superb product at a fair price"
Would have given AirCalin a perfect score, except for the return flight being operated by code share partner Air New Zealand which was simply dreadful. Web checked, bag dropped, boarding a breeze. Welcomed by friendly crew. The lunch service included a separate aperitif service (chose the pastis! ), followed by a 3 course meal (salad, main and dessert) full bar service. After lunch was cleared, the crew came through offering duty free and a digestif (cognac). Champagne available for purchase. Used my tablet to connect to inflight wifi streaming entertainment as no PTVs fitted on A320 (only redeeming feature of Air NZ). Wifi worked perfectly. In summary, AirCalin offer a superb product at a fair price. Just avoid their codeshare flights between Auckland and Noumea.

### Aircalin customer review
Food highly edible and service was perfect. Wine very good. The only disappointment was that the Qantas Business Lounge was dreadful. Everyone spoke English although French was preferred. There was no PTV which was disappointing.

### Aircalin customer review
Flight 801 from Manila to Noumea via Tokyo Narita. I was satisfied with their onboard service, cabin crew were friendly and polite. The food was delicious. Will fly with this airline again.

### Aircalin customer review
My flight from MEL to NOU was a great experience. The check-in at Melbourne was very fast and efficient. Boarding was on time and the cabin crew were very welcoming and friendly. The plane is newest and safe.The economy class seat have not PTV's but the newest A320 equipped with new video on demand system connected by wifi on your smartphone tablet or computer. After Take off an aperitif followed by a hot lunch was served. however the cabin crew are not very far. My experience on Aircalin is not too bad.

### Aircalin customer review
Sydney - Noumea. Didn't know what to expect from this smaller airline. Was a full flight with school holidays over. Staff at the gate were a combination of Qantas and Air Calin crew. Aircraft was a modern A330. Helps to have a small understanding of French because the crew will address you in French first. Really impressed by meal service. A full tray with salad bread main and dessert. Landing in Noumea on second attempt due to a go-around but crew were very professional throughout the flight. Entertainment system only covered a limited selection in comparison to other carriers.

### Aircalin customer review
We travelled to Noumea on this airline-code share with Qantas on the outgoing leg and AirCailin on the return leg. The outgoing trip with Qantas was so sub-standard. With Qantas there was no entertainment we could see only two screens out of 5 visible in our section of the cabin and the meal served was inedible! However to my surprise the service was fantastic! The food was not only edible but enjoyable the service was swift polite and plentiful-the brandy at the end of the meal was a lovely touch. Individual screen for movies was also much appreciated. I would have no hesitation in flying this airline again or recommending it to friends.

### Aircalin customer review
Fantastic flight Very pleased with the very high standard of service provided! Flew from Tountouta to Sydney on AirCalin on the airline's only A320-232. Very friendly crew Very nice meal (supposed to be a breakfast but lasted well into the afternoon) comfortable seats and pleasant views of the Pacific. One of the best flights I've ever been on. Very highly recommended.

### Aircalin customer review
Flew NOU to SYD 23rd Oct SB140. Efficient check in at Noumea. On board A330 plenty of legroom in Economy. Great onboard service in in French and English very friendly. Pre lunch drinks offered as well as wine with lunch. Extra bread rolls offered with water runs and after lunch Cognac was also offered. Service not really expected for a 3 hour flight. Looking forward to my next Air Calin flight.

### Aircalin customer review
AKL-NOU on A320 business class. The check-in and lounge in Auckland is very nice. The cabin is very clean and the seat is old but is comfortable. The pitch is good we only had a shared TV. During boarding the purser welcomed us and offered champagne or cocktails. We had appetizers followed by lunch.

### Aircalin customer review
NRT-NOU on new A332s economy class. Check-in in Narita is very fast and friendly. Boarded on time and there were 2 queues one for the hibiscus class customers and one for economy class customers. On board the cabin crew were friendly and professional. On my seat I had a pillow a blanket and amenity kit. The new seat is very comfortable and ergonomic the pitch is ok and the cabin is clean and pleasant. Just 30 minutes after take off the meals services start and only refreshment was served. The new entertainment system has a wide choice and we could connect a usb port to the screen the headphones had good quality. 1.5 hrs before landing a breakfast was served and during landing candy was distributed.

### Aircalin customer review
Brisbane - New Caledonia - Tahiti. First leg was in a bright clean new A330. Business cabin only half full. My e-ticket had said “cold meal” but I was served a full hot dinner with quality French wines for just a 2 hour flight. IFE was adequate but surprisingly had no classical music. Flight was 50 min late departing because of late arrival of the aircraft which I suspect was due ongoing issues at Brisbane airport. The fairly new international airport for New Caledonia was bright and welcoming. The business lounge was small but modern. Excellent canapés and miniature cremes brulées. The flight for the second leg was operated by Air Tahiti Nui. This was not a codeshare as Air Tahiti Nui do not offer the flight themselves. A bright clean new A340. I was served a full hot lunch with quality French wines. IFE was satisfactory by modern standards. Overall a very high standard of comfort and service.

### Aircalin customer review
NOU-SYD. Lacklustre crew with very few smiles. Food of mediocre quality for Business Class cabin too hot and not adjusted despite request. Not an experience to remember.

### Aircalin customer review
SYD-NOU return. What a disappointment-after reading some of the good reviews I was looking forward to the trip. The check in at SYD was a disaster-4 economy desks with only one manned until they could find one more as the economy queue got longer and longer Also the outward journey was delayed by 45 minutes with little explanation . Once onboard the cabin crew were condescending if you spoke no French and the food was stale. The PTV was ok on the A330 but I returned on the A320 which only had limited audio. This flight was also late. There was hardly any legroom and to top it all off the bags didn't arrive at the carousel until at least 40 minutes later.

### Aircalin customer review
SYD-NOU Economy A330. Wonderful flight and service - especially compared to Qantas on the way back! Great food. Lovely wine and digestif..

### Aircalin customer review
SYD-NOU: We departed with an hour's delay and arrived late not too bad though. The plane was super very new and very clean the staff attentive and the food great. It was a very French experience their English could be improved.

### Aircalin customer review
The planes are quite new A320 & 330 roomy and comfortable featuring blue lagoon (fishes) seats. Nice PTVs (reliable and good quality screen and content) in A330. A320 have footrests adjustable headrest and good pitch even in economy. Hibuscus business class seats on 320 & 330 are very good especially for 2 or 3 hours flights. Meals are good even on short flights (NOU-BNE 1:35) you have a hot meal with choice of 2 dishes if the flight is on lunch or dinner time if not a snack or breakfast. On medium (PPT) to long haul flight (NRT & KIX) you have two meals. Wines champagne in business class liqueur after meals and aperitif. Overall good FA although it can really depend : there are better and worse FA. The check-in is usually efficient excepted during christmas holidays : additional flights and Noumea Tontouta's 12 check- in counters are not enough for 3 flight nearly at the same time. Boarding is quick and flight rarely late.

### Aircalin customer review
SYD-NOU Business Class. Nice roomy A330 - very clean and well maintained. Friendly crew - nice champagne and wines but food not up to much. Pleasant relaxing and uneventful flight.

### Aircalin customer review
NOU-NRT return. Almost new Airbus A330 good flight entertainment system but the crew wasn't nice and seem to be inexperienced and not very conscious about safety (customers walking in the cabin while the seatbelt sign was on). The meals were similar to low cost airlines and choice of drinks was also very poor. I wish I had the choice of another airlines between Noumea and Tokyo but unfortunately Air Calin is the only one on this destination.

### Aircalin customer review
Brisbane-Noumea-Brisbane. The legroom on the A320 was great. The cabin service was ok. The entertainment program on both legs was very ordinary and the food abysmal - I am sure that the sandwiches and cake for the Sunday flight were prepared on Friday - they were extremely dry and the cucumber in the sandwiches had dried out and pickled itself. We did see a menu left behind from the previous segment from Auckland - it looked much better. The quality of food and entertainment really let the airline down.

### Aircalin customer review
As a regular traveller throughout the Pacific for over 30 years I have found the Aircalin services especially good. The check in service is excellent and friendly the staff helpful for those who don't speak French. The menus are always a surprise with generous meals and drinks presented in immaculate style. Their new planes are first class in comparison with the Qantas 767 Sunday afternoon flight from Noumea to Sydney where old planes (200 series) and grumpy staff generally bring you back to earth with all of the finesse of a smack in the face.

### Aircalin customer review
Travelled SYD-NOU-SYD with Air Calin. The experience could only be described as brilliant. Take-off was on-time in both directions food was very acceptable in-flight service was impeccable with wine drinks and quality French brandy offered to all in economy class. The aircraft was new and very clean. I would highly recommend them and would definitely fly with them again

### Aircalin customer review
Air Calin AKL-NOU (originally also NOU-AKL as well - but they decided to go on strike). Apart from boarding the aircraft (a beautiful A330) and waiting around an hour for who knows what reason as all passengers were seated and ready for some tropical sunshine and French culture which awaited us 3 hours away it was a pleasant and well done flight. My Kosher meal was bought to me before take off so I could "break the seal" and it could be heated up for me - the meal was nice but lacked presentation and creativity of everyone elses meals - which looked and smelt divine. The FA's all very well groomed and with mediocre manors were to some extent inhibited with their english skills which were good but just hidden behind shyness. The seats were very comfortable excellent PTV entertainment with each movie in four languages and at least 6 options + games - too much for a less than 3 hour flight. The inflight mag was also good but there wasn't much in the way of newspapers. Very scenic approach to Noumea - however I was a bit concerned about one of the stewardess' continuing a conversation with a passenger she obviously knew for half the flight (not actually doing any thing else after the meal was served) and continuing it until about 20 seconds to touch down - way after the announcement had been made to be seated. Tantouta airport is not made to handle a full A330 on a summer day it felt like there was no air con and the lines were horrendous - made worse with another wait for our bags. Customs was very relaxed though...as was any laws regarding smoking. Coming home was a bit of a feat. We turned up at the airport at 5 am after being told that there was only one previously delayed flight going to AKL due to a flight attendant strike or something along those lines. We were put up in a rat hotel by the airport by Air Calin until 1am in the morning when we were all shuttled back to the airport to check in etc (more lines) and a few hours later find out that our rescue ride home hadn't even left NZ yet - more waiting in one of the least entertaining airports in the world. Finally our air NZ plane arrived (on which my boarding pass was labelled with KSML yet did I get one - pity as I was looking forward to the far more entertaining Air Calin to carry me home and end my French Fling in my favourite holiday destination with a French Flair and decent service!

### Aircalin customer review
I recently travelled Aircalin BNE-NOU-BNE in economy class and cannot report with the same enthusiasm as other reviewers. The meal out of BNE was served immediately upon take-off and fell well short of the 'French-style cuisine' advertised on Aircalin's website consisting of a stale bread roll 4 slices of cold meat and a bland lettuce salad. The seat pitch in economy was reasonable and the PTV's on the A320 offered a good range of options including movies games and destination info. FA's were efficient though it was obvious that French-speaking passengers were receiving preferential service. The return flight was delayed by 2 hours due to the crew needing a rest (bad scheduling?). Meal on the return flight on the smaller 737 was better again served immediately upon takeoff. FA's were not to be seen for the rest of the flight once the meal service was over. No PTV's on the 737 and the entertainment on the main screens was only in French with no subtitles. Generally the experience was very average and I would not be in a hurry to fly Aircalin again.

### Aircalin customer review
Aircalin NOU-SYD and it was a very pleasant flight. Check-in staff was friendly and helpful. The meal provided for this early morning flight was very good and plentiful. Got an omelette with sausages French bread croissant brioche fresh fruit yoghurt cheese tea and coffee. There was also a second round of warm bread and drinks. The cabin crew was very pleasant and smiling. The plane was their 737-300 and it was a bit run down but Aircalin is replacing the aircraft with a brand new A320 in January. Well done Aircalin you are doing New Caledonia proud.

### Aircalin customer review
SYD-NOU-BNE in coach and was pleasantly surprised by their product & service. The aircraft was a brand new A330 cool blue interior (seashell feature) each seat had its personal tv reasonable seat pitch given that I'm 6.2ft tall. The check-in staff at NOU were very friendly & helpful given that I don't speak french!

### Aircalin customer review
I have just completed a round rip from Papeete to Osaka via Noumea with Aircalin. I was extremely surprised by the quality of service provided onboard and on the ground. I flew their Hibiscus Business class PPT to NOU then coach and I have to say that Aircalin beats several major airlines I have travelled with during the last few years. The plane used was a brand new A 330 aircraft and once onboard you can expect to be greeted with warm and friendly smiles from the flight attendants. The food was plentiful and varied. The entertainment system was tip top. All in all for very long flights a generally pleasant experience would definitely consider flying Aircalin again.
