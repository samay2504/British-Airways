### "food was better than average"
Thomas Cook Airlines Scandinavia is an airline that grows on me. Was not expecting twin aisle wide body jet but the aircraft couldn't have been more than a couple of years old flying from Stockholm to Gran Canaria. All seats had seat back AVOD. Films and TV were SEK 50 which seemed good value. I opted for the free music about 20 channels and also charged my phone through the USB port. Food was better than average and there seemed to be plenty of it. Drinks about SEK 35 for a Heineken and SEK 25 for a Coke. Beware seat recline button is hidden near the seat bottom. Would recommend.

### "had to pay to get water"
Was horrified to find I had to pay to get water with Thomas Cook Airlines Scandinavia flying from Stockholm to Cancun. I mean I understand you can pay for beverages such as alcohol and soft drinks but come on on a 12 hour flight to only supply coffee and tea on two occasions, its just inhuman and greedy to make people pay for water. As for paying for inflight entertainment once again just money hungry. Food was ok what little I had, I'm not an over weight person and eat normally but portion control is in full effect. Staff were ok but I got knocked twice with the drinks cart as the were coming through the aisle. Staff are more like sales people, only interested in sell sell sell.

CPH-Hurghada-CPH. Flew this airline as part of a charter flight/holiday in the Red Sea. Both flights I enjoyed immensely. Credit for this goes to the cabin crew and their ability to generate such a happy atmosphere in cabin. The food quality served was by far the best I have put my teeth into for economy class in more than 42 years of flying around the world. On top of this the plane was literally an all new A321 I had paid a little extra for a few extra centimetres of leg space thumbs up arrival on time at both ends.

GOT-AYT-GOT. We choose this airline because it was a part of a charter trip. We went on a 211 seat A321 its was quite big. It was as you expect in a economy class airplane (not much legroom quite cramped). The seats were quite nice but you will notice that they have been there for a while but it works fine. The cabin-crew are very friendly and nice. The food onboard was okay. You can't expect that much from an airline in the food section. We thought we were going to get breakfast as we flew at 7.00 in the morning. Instead we got meatballs in a sauce which was really nice!

HEL-Funchal-HEL on a A321-200. The interior is dated but in good shape. Old style bulky seats with very little legroom. It is a charter flight and it shows in the level of service and seat comfort. The only thing in common with quality airlines is the cost of the ticket. The only reason for flying with such an airline is the non-stop service between Helsinki and Madeira.

Arlanda to Marsa Alam return. All things considered it was better than the Tui equivalent (where our 25 and 7 year old's were only offered coffee or tea no water as a beverage for paid meals. Staff were friendly food looked great (we packed our own) and no price gouging on the drinks service.

Royal Class flights Helsinki-Phuket on A330-200 aircraft. A quick but rather rude check-in at HEL. An access to a new comfortable lounge at HEL was a nice surprise no lounge access at HKT though. A priority boarding for Royal Class passengers. The seat was a major disappointment: worn out and uncomfortable expected better comfort in premium class. The entertainment system was ancient and didn't even work probably on the return flight. The two meals served on the ex-Helsinki flight were tasty but not the same quality on return. Service was professional but impersonal no smiles. A sufficient amenity kit was a nice touch but delivered on the HEL-HKT flight only. Will choose their Royal Class again only if new seats and better IFE will be installed.

HEL-TFS-HEL with A321. Efficient check-in. Very simple and small prepaid hot meal for a 7 hrs flight. Meal should be more filling. Two very different flights. Outbound flight had a professional and attentive service. Inbound flight had a rude and unhelpful crew we were sitting on exit row 11. No smiles at all and they intend to sell everything too many disturbing announcements when you are trying to read and relax. Seats were dirty and showing their age. What is also annoying - return flights from Canary Islands to Finland are almost always late with this airline. Not worth for the money as we paid expensive flight tickets only.

HEL-LPA return with A321. Booked flights 7 months earlier and reservation for 2 exit seats for extra charge from their call center was kept at check in. Generous legroom. Friendly attentive crew flight deck announcements and clean aircraft made 6 hrs flight more enjoyable for a leisure flight. Also our pre booked Holiday Meal on outbound flight was surprisingly tasty and hot and portions were more filling than we have had for this route with other carriers. Only minus was inbound flight meal which was bit tasteless perhaps due to LPA catering. Drinks for purchase but all in all flight with them (DK) offered more holiday feeling than our national carriers charter flight offers. Baggage came fast at LPA but in HEL it took more than 45min due to ground handling problems.
