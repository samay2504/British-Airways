### "response was sorry for the delay"
My flight was supposed to depart Tampa at 3:48pm. I was told to be at the airport 3 hours early. Around 3 pm I started receiving messages from sun country delaying our flight. The flight didn't leave Tampa until 8pm. Their policy states 3 hrs domestic delays and 6 hr international delays. Their customer support argues it's 6 hr delays, only response was sorry for the delay and have a good day.

### "flawed customer service"
Not Verified |  Unprofessional business practices, flawed customer service, failure to provide services as advertised, complete refusal to provide refunds. I was booked a flight PHX -> MSP -> MCO by my employer. The flight to MSP was delayed over an hour due to a "controllable error" on behalf of Sun Country which caused me to miss my connecting flight to MCO. There was another Sun Country flight to MCO from the same terminal. I was denied access to this flight because the attendant "wasn't allowed to rebook at the gate. The flight took off with empty seats in it and me stuck in MSP. I was told my checked bag was at MCO by Sun Country representatives. I would later come to find this was a lie. I was offered a rebook that would have me landing at MCO 14 hours after the original flight's landing; this was not an option as I had my brother's wedding to attend as his best man. I was refused all options to be rebooked on a different airline despite the fact that I was inconvenienced by Sun Country on a mistake that was solely their fault. I accepted a voucher for the cost of the flight and figured my employer could keep the voucher and pay me the cost of a rebook with Frontier. I rebooked with Frontier and then was informed, moments before boarding my new flight, that my bag was in MSP. Apparently, without my consent, the bag was refunded as well and left sitting in MSP without my knowledge - I only learned because I was called by a Sun Country representative while at the gate to depart with Frontier. Sun Country refused to send my bag to Orlando using the voucher. I had to leave the terminal, grab my bag, check it and pay it out-of-pocket to Frontier, and then get back to my gate before departure. During this process, Sun Country failed to locate me on all online platforms to offer support as the ticket was purchased by someone else on my behalf and I did not have access to their purchasing card information or personal email (despite having my ID, flight information, and personal information to complete an account lookup). Avoid flying with Sun Country at all costs.

### "my bag with shorts and tshirts was in violation"
Not Verified |  I flew from Ft Walton Beach to Minneapolis in August on Sun Country airlines. At the Sun Country desk I put my bag in their holder to make sure I was legal with my bag. The desk agent cleared me and said no violation. A few weeks later I fled back on Sun Country. While boarding at the gate, the Sun Country employee grabbed my left arm and pulled. He pulled me out of line. He stated my bag with shorts and tshirts was in violation. I informed it had less content than when I flew up with it and it was confirmed by a Sun Country employee. He said I had to pay a $65 fine. I presented my Delta American Express card and be stated “ you should have flown Delta.” Being retired from law enforcement I kept reserved and didn’t say anything. He then said we don’t take American Express. I used my bank card then. I paid it and was the last one too board. I overheard this Sun Country employee tell another one at the gate “ what an idiot move thinking he was going to get away with it.” I couldn’t imagine working in this field talking to a customer like this. I filed a complaint with Sun Country over two weeks ago and never received and feedback or correspondence from Sun Country.

### "stressful and worst experience"
Not Verified |  I Chose this Airline for a ticket for my Daughter (who is a minor). Not only did her flight get cancelled but she got stranded for a day and it was the most stressful and worst experience a Father could have! 4 Plus hours on hold trying to get an agent on the phone turned into a whole day waiting to speak to a representative. When I finally get the Sun Country rep to call me back they were very cold and not apologetic at all! They said all they can do is issue a small refund in comparison to what I spent and the traumatic experience my daughter went through! Shame on you guys and your company to handle this scenario with no human decency or to fully take care of your customer on all angles! I hope a higher up at this company see's this and has the heart to reach me to have a decent conversation about this experience, as I will never gladly spend one penny with you in the future also every person I know I will highly not recommend they use this airline!

### "One of the worst airlines"
One of the worst airlines. Frequently do not display their flight information and could care less. First class is a joke no different than normal flight. Worst service ever.

### "Avoid this airline"
Avoid this airline. This is my 3rd time flying with Sun Country and each time the return flight has been canceled. When the flight is canceled the airport staff is of no help or support. Out of Mexico they announced the flight is canceled and the next flight going out was in 3 days. After they said that and people had more questions they said call the company and that was it. We received an email to setup a hotel, but the selections were undesirable and no transportation was offered. I declined to be put on the next flight and booked my own flight with American Airlines. It took over 2 months to receive my refund for the flight. Second time this happened was last month (Jun 2024), I didn’t even wait around to ask questions, I declined the hotel, they did not offer to rebook our flights, I purchased my own flight again and I’m still waiting on my refund. Now today (27 Jul 24) in Punta Cana the flight is canceled again. Since it is Saturday and I don’t have to work to tomorrow, I decided to stay another night and see if the flight will leave tomorrow. Thankfully I do not have any more trips planned with Sun Country flights and I will never use them again.

### "made us move from our seats"
Not Verified |   Sun Country made us move from our seats on June but on 7/22 while traveling with 3 family members we were bumped from our exit row seats we had for months so Sun Country Airlines employees could sit there. All that was left for my son and daughter were middle row seats. Our plane was diverted to Rochester to take on fuel because sun country planes can’t fly for more than 2 1/2 hours so instead of us all sitting together in exit rows were were spread out all over the plane. When I contact customer service "so sorry" was all I got. In June they gave us $25 for in conscience. This time nothing. An airline disrupts a passenger for a sun country and we don’t even get a $100 voucher each? Two flights in a row we had to move I have had it with Sun Country Airlines. Not surprising they have 2 1/2 stars

### "airline and employees are garbage"
Traveling with my wife two children 5 and 7 and all in pre-selected premium seats in same row. Checked in and checked bags all good and when boarding at gate they say we moved your seats and moved me away from my family and premium aisle seat to 15 rows back and a middle seat and refused to explain why. The agent and the gate was rude and disgusting. Treated my wife and I like garbage. We will never fly sun country again. Couple of other things - a flight attendant was so rude to a non English speaking person in an exit row and moved them and treated them like garbage also. The cleaners come barreling into the plane pushing passengers and are also rude but probably taking direction from airline management. Your airline and employees are garbage. Never again.

### "customer service is non existent"
We were 90 minutes late for first departure and almost 3 hours late for the return trip. Attendants don't quite cross the line to rude but customer service is non existent. Planes feel like they will fall apart mid flight. Plane was filthy! If at all possible I will never fly this airline again. Biggest warning....DO NOT BOOK RENTAL WITH THEM. They do not include taxes or incidentals from the rental agency. I prepaid and our rental was almost TWICE as much once we got to airport. Horrible airline AVOID whenever possible

### “flight has been delayed three times”
Not Verified |  This is the worst airline experience I’ve ever encountered. My 76-year-old father is currently stranded at Minneapolis, MN airport, needing to fly to Washington, DC on flight number 223. The flight has been delayed three times, now exceeding 5 hours. He doesn’t speak English well, he’s a tourist, and he’s feeling unwell. Despite this, the company hasn’t been able to assist him.This will be the first and last time I purchase a ticket with Sun Country Airlines.

### "do not recommend this airline"
Plane rides to and from my destination was very rough and uncomfortable. The seats are awful and uncomfortable and the customer on both rides to and from was a 0/10. I do not recommend this airline and will not be flying with them again.

### "I was not asking for a refund"
I booked these tickets for 1 sole reason, my mother was diagnosed with lung cancer and needed a procedure on the 16th. Everyone gets a confirmation and I’m sure I’m not the first that didn’t look, it didn’t dawn on me that there could have been an error. I actually paid for 2 flights, I was not asking for a refund but at least a voucher. I literally paid for 2 flights with Sun country getting paid for 3. As far as the car rental I was given a voucher towards that. Again my husband was on as the driver, I was not in a position to drive. Now this brings me to luggage had my name on another person’s checked bag, a whole different issue.

### "never use Sun Country again"
Not Verified |  Horrible service. Will never use Sun Country again. Long lines to wait to check in our luggage. Instead of checking luggage in, staff was messing around ignoring the long line in front of them. One counter open to check in luggage during the busy time when 6 counters were available but unstaffed. Security was so unorganized and took forever to get through.

### “I was sorely let down”
Not Verified | I decided to give Sun Country a chance as an airline when visiting a friend with my daughter, however I was sorely let down by the whole experience. Our initial flight had a one hour delay before even taking off. This delay then forced us to miss our connecting flight, also by Sun Country. When I asked for help with getting to our destination due to this missed flight, which was their fault, 6 months pregnant and with a 9-yr-old in tow, they said the best they could do was book me a flight in 24hrs and we could sleep in the airport. Seeing as my trip was a 3 day visit and I was in a city for a layover where we knew nobody, this did not seem like a reasonable choice. When I asked for a refund of my original flight they would not even give me that, saying they were not liable for any delays. I then proceeded to book with another airline to get to my final destination, but when I arrived, my luggage from my original Sun Country flight was NOT at my destination. They then called me about my lost luggage a week later after I had already returned home, after me having to make due without my daughter's car seat while in our destination city. When I called them to discuss this horrible experience, I was on hold for >30mins and when I requested a call back I never received one. Finally when they called about my luggage I was able to talk to someone in customer service, yet no apologies, refunds, or compensation of any kind were offered.

### "Terrible experience"
Not Verified |  Terrible experience. Lost our luggage. No one from the airline was at the airport when we landed. Walked around for 2 hours at the airport taking to everyone and finally someone was able to give us the customer service phone number. We called at 10pm and no one answered, cake back at 8am. They said we have to report lost luggage within 4 hours. How is it possible when no one answers the phone or is at the airport? Rude all around for the next month.

### "said nothing about the extra cost"
The flight for my wife and me was pretty standard for a budget carrier. My complaint comes from the fact that my wife had to make changes to her itinerary due to a funeral in Minnesota. She called them to change her flight from one date to the next, which was fine. However, our son was on the same flight and his ticket was canceled and reissued for the same flight. It cost us $278 for him to get a 1 way flight that he already had. The person on the line said nothing about the extra cost until after the changes were made. Then there was nothing we could do about it. This low-cost carrier will do whatever it can to get you to pay extra. There is no grace for a death in the family extending a stay.

### "Everything is the opposite of customer friendly"
Not Verified |  We went to Niagara Falls for our anniversary from October 1st through October 8 of 2023. I had booked Sun Country for a previous trip that got canceled. We had a voucher to use so we used it for this trip. Booked it several mos. in advanced. When we booked it I was told the Voucher would cover bags, seats, and everything. When I went to check in online the night before only to find out that it did not cover any of that and had to spend an additional $270.00 for seats and bags. They had a rental car option pop up so I thought I would check and see if their rate was any better. They quoted me a rate that I thought was about $75.00 better than the one that I had on my own. However, when I got the total after putting my card in it actually came out to $40.00 more than I had on my own. I immediately tried to cancel it. I was then told I had to call customer service to do that it could not be done online but customer service would not be open till 8:00 am. I called at 8:02 am and again tried to cancel the reservation. I was then told by customer service that there are no refunds on rental cars that I could only receive a voucher that would do me no good then I would be paying for two cars and didn't need theirs since it was more expensive than what I could get on my own. So I still took there's even though it cost more. So the bottom line with this airline is this first you better read all the small print or they will take advantage of you every way they can. If they get their hands on your money you will never see it back period the only thing you will get is a voucher so that they still keep you locked into using them. In addition to all the above their in flight WIFI entertainment is not worth downloading or connecting too. I quit mid flight and never worked again. They have no app to manage your fight or check-ins or anything. In addition to the above if you misplace your receipts you can not simply log into your booking and redownload it. You have to send an email to customer service and request they send it to you. Everything with this airline is the opposite of customer friendly. They make everything difficult and un customer friendly. My wife and I have only flown this airline one time and it will be the last time. In my book they are not a low cost airline they are a pretend low cost airline.

### "get home 24 hours later then scheduled"
Not Verified |  Sun Country left me hanging for the second time in a year and a half. As a airline transportation corporation they do not care about you and me. They will always have travelers to fill the seats. At the end of the day, sun country will get theirs, and that's all that matters. I did get home 24 hours later then scheduled. Let's not forget about the family of five that are so special that kept us at the gate for another hour and a half to board the plan through customs. Best part of this flight, Uber was there on time to get me home.

### "I am so very grateful"
My daughter and I did a landline/air the day before our cruise. We left Fargo, ND on the landline bus which was to drop us off at MSP for our 3:15 pm departure flight. The bus broke down half way to MSP, which made us miss our flight. I do not remember the names of the two ladies I spoke with but they were both amazing and made a stressful situation less stressful. I was given two options. They offered us a hotel and food vouchers for the night we would have to stay in Minneapolis and could get us on a flight the next morning out of MSP at 0700 and land in Orlando at 11:12 AM. 2Once we arrived at MSP on 06AUG2023 they would check with other airlines to see if there were 2 available seats flying to MCO that evening and Sun Country would pay for those tickets. We were flying to Orlando for a cruise on 07AUG2023, and were scheduled to check in to the ship at 12;00 noon. Beings we did not know when we would arrive at the airport we took option #1. There was no extra fee and my daughter and I were provided transportation (from airport to hotel and back to airport the next AM) that Sun Country provided (Hilton) and we were given meal vouchers. I cannot say enough good about the wonderful assistance I was provided, they worked very hard to get us to Orlando so we could board our cruise. I am so very grateful! Thank you.

### "I had absolutely no issues"
My flight from North Carolina to anchorage Alaska: after reading 9 pages of bad reviews all from June and July of this year with the exception of 2 good/alright reviews to say I was a little worried was an understatement. As you read your reviews you will see a lot of terrible customer service and cancelled flights (which what I most nervous about especially flying with a 3 and 6 year old.) Our first flight was from North Carolina to Minneapolis was on time. The customer service at the gate and ticketing counter was very friendly..it was the same person at both! No snacks are offered but it was a shorter flight at around 2 hours and 45 mins. But we did get a beverage! There were charging ports located at the bottom of the seat in front of you. Mine worked my husbands did not but no big deal! The flight attendants were not overly nice. But more acted like they have had worked so much and we’re tired but they weren’t rude. Our flight got in on time and out of Minneapolis our flight left on time to Alaska. This flight from Minneapolis to Alaska was a bit longer at 5 hours and 48 minutes. The airline did not provide any sort of snack but did give us 2 drinks throughout! I do have to mention you can buy snacks from them. From my experience this is a very budget friendly airline. There is no inflight wifi to purchase and no screens on the back of the seats but with tickets being much less and total flying time less it’s a good airline to use! Thus far I have had no problems and want to thank Sun Country for a good experience flying to Alaska! Now our return flight from Anchorage to North Carolina. The flights were about the same no delays and a great flight staff from anchorage to Minneapolis! Overall I had absolutely no issues flying with Sun Country and as a “budget” airline they completely meet expectations!

### "Don't make the same mistake I did"
Not Verified | Don't ever make your rental car reservation with your plane reservation from Sun Country! Instead, make your car reservation directly with the car company. I made the mistake of reserving my rental car as part of my Sun Country flight reservation. As a result I ended up having to pay for 2 rental cars even though I used only one, costing me an extra $600. Here's what happened. I flew to my destination and went to the rental car counter (Budget), but the line was 25 people long and after waiting an hour, the line advanced only 4 people. At this rate, it was going to take another 4-5 hours before I got my car. I had a meeting I needed to attend in 2 hours, so I decided to cancel my reservation with Budget and instead reserve a car with a different car company. But Budget wouldn't refund me my money because Sun Country had not yet given the money to Budget, and Sun Country would not refund me my money because they said you have to cancel at least 2 days in advance! So I lost the money I gave Sun Country for the car rental. Don't make the same mistake I did!

### "choosing not the fly with them again"
I previously flew with Sun Country for a nonstop to Minnesota, no problems whatsoever, back in 2021. This time around, I am choosing not the fly with them again. Although the flights are reasonable (that’s what you would think), you make up for that in other fees. If you’re a solo traveler with no carry-on on checked luggage needed, you may have no issues. But if that is not the case I’d advise paying just a bit more for another airline. Included with the flight ticket is one personal item, a carry on or checked bag is $45, and every other bag is $35 after the first. Keep in minds that if this a round trip that’s $90 both ways. In addition, they will have you pay extra for seating near your group or other travel persons, and if you can’t afford that cost starting at around $9 extra per seat, you will be seated at random. Does not matter if you purchased the tickets together, they do not observe that, whereas other flights will. Even with age, doesn’t matter how the child they will split you up and you would have to take your chances requesting seats together once you get to the airport. Another little hiccup is that they don’t have an assigned gate when you check in early for tickets, and you have to go to the flight board to check that, this may not be an inconvenience for most, but for me I just didn’t take that too well, when other airlines provide you a gate , more often than not when you do early check in 24 hours within departure. Needless to say, I should have paid the extra $40 per flight (with personal item and carry on included) instead of choosing this cheaper flight, because I more than made up for it in the long run. Won’t be flying anymore, but thank you for getting to my destinations safely.

### "not worth the stress"
It's not worth it! Sun Country Airlines canceled my flight on the same day, with less than 12 hours prior departure. It was the last one from that airline that day so I had to purchase another flight with a different company. I ended up paying 3 times more. They reimbursed the canceled flight but they refuse to reimbursed the one I had to purchase because of their cancellation, even though my lawyer sent them a letter. So the trip ended up being more expensive that if I had chose another airline on the first place. I am never booking with Sun Country Airlines again, it's not worth the stress and inconvenience.

### "will not fly your airline again"
Purchased 4 tickets online. Wife and myself, one child and her friend. While boarding my wife and myself were ahead of our two kids, we passed the ticket counter with our carryon's and proceeded to our seats. I get a text from my kid saying they stopped them from boarding because they had to pay for their carryon. Sun country charged them $50 per bag on the spot. On the return the kids went solo as my wife and I stayed three extra days. The girls were stopped again and charged $60 per bag. On my return with my wife no one stopped us and we walked in with our carryon's. Why were the un accompanied kids charged for their carryon's? Sun country, I will not fly your airline again and will not recommend it to anyone either.

### "not been informed of anything"
First our flight was delayed, then after sending us up and flying for an hour they sent us back because apparently our plane needed scheduled maintenancey. After returning to Dallas we waiting in the runway for hours. Our flight was scheduled to arrive in Cancun at about 12:50. It is 1pm as I type this, we have not been informed of anything, have not moved are just smelling air plane fumes, and have had our vacation start off terribly. I thought that it would be a cheap alternative to American Airlines but I think paying that extra for less delays will be worth it. Save yourself some time and fly another airline if you’re going to Cancun from Dallas.

### "a very poor showing on Sun Country's part"
Not Verified |  The worst plane maintenance available, on a brand new jet they alternately froze us then cooked us at least 4 times in a 3 and a half hour trip and gave the excuse that "it is a brand new plane" so we are still working out the details. Really? Do you think maybe they could figure it out before putting it into service? Do they think the same way about maybe the landing gear as well? Or the bolts that hold the seats down? Don't even ask what is going on with the temperature because the "experienced" flight attendants are not going to lower themselves to taking care of the problem, they just say they have notified the captain about the issue and they will glare at you if you ask more than once. On the next flight my air controls didn't work at all but I still had a cold blast of air coming down my neck for 3.5 hours and again no sign of help even after I asked what's going on with the air flow. I had to hide in the forward rest room and block the air vent in there to get respite. Very uncomfortable. This last trip (or non trip) was the straw that broke the camels back. I arrived as I usually do early by at least 1.5 hours and waited at gate 16 even though the marquee read 'FRONTIER AIRLINES TO ORLANDO FLIGHT 1194 TIME: 8:42 STATUS: NOW AT 9:02' which meant to me that my flight was probably delayed, so when I inquired I was told my flight had boarded and they gave my seat away even though no effort was made to call my name which is easy to do. I have a very distinctive name. By then 4, count 'em, 4 agents were busy making sure the plane was full and couldn't accommodate me. Even though I later found out they still had one seat available when my partner inquired with the home office. On top of that they tore up my boarding pass so I couldn't show it to bolster my complaint. I also turned in a lost purse during my wait time to gate 15 so that would prove even more I was there at the gate and ready as was another fella who was also denied boarding. I can't tell you how much arguing ensued when all this came down. If the agents had put in half as much effort into making this right as they did arguing and accusing me of being absent, I would be at my cardiologists office on Tuesday morning in Chaska, Minnesota as I was supposed to be. As it stands they re-booked me for 6-21-23 and my ticket has been messed up price wise now and I can't figure out how a round trip on your airline is $782.91 when it should be no more than $300 to $400 or so, no checked bags, just one carry on and one free one. I will call at 7 a.m. on Tuesday the 20th and attempt to get some satisfaction out of the front office. All in all a very poor showing on Sun Country's part and to boot a lot of accusations and arguing on the agents part, when they still had my seat available. The gal on the phone at your office says there were no notes about this transgression on the logs, but hopefully by tomorrow something will break. I really miss the red headed fella who was so personable and professional every time I flew out of San Diego, I hope he does well in Denver. Disappointed in San Diego.

### "I recommend this airline"
Not Verified | Amazing airline. But some things to work on. The carry on bag size is too small and the price to buy an over head luggage is to expensive. It’s a perfectly fine airline except for that. I recommend this airline if you are going for no longer than 3 days. If not I recommend Delta, They had amazing service and that experience was amazing

### "Will not recommend to anyone"
They delayed our flight 5 times. Then they decided to just straight up cancel the whole flight and reschedule it for the next day. It would be understandable if the weather did not permit a safe flight. But the weather was amazing...clear skies...low wind...it was a beautiful sunny day. We attempted to get a refund for our all inclusive hotel that was already paid for because the deadline to cancel for a refund had already passed. We submitted pictures of our expenses via email and explained that the cancellation on their part was not weather related. Their response......our policy states that we do not reimburse for the loss a hotel room due to a cancelled flight. The flight attendant on flight 558 was absolutely horrible!!! Yelling at women and children trying to use the bathroom before the flight was scheduled to depart. Arguing with senior citizens and just yelling.....do not argue with me! Horrible first experience on this flight. Will not recommend to anyone.

### "never been treated so poorly"
Not Verified | This airline should be ashamed of their poor customer service and business practice! I drove 70 miles and paid for parking and an Uber ride to the airport only to be told, while checking my bag, that my flight had been canceled. NO TEXT, NO EMAIL, NO NOTIFICATION, WHATSOEVER! The Sun Country agent told me to exit the line and that I had to reschedule or get a refund, also to be told that the only flight going to the same city wasn't leaving til 5pm the next day, which was already full. This airline canceled a flight at the last second and obviously had no plans to accommodate anyone. I was flying to see my grandfather in hospice care, my money and more than anything, my time was utterly wasted. Time I'll never get back and Sun Country did nothing but show a blatant disregard for their PAYING customers. No voucher will make this right! Not that it was even offered! I travel by airplane at least once a month, and I've never been treated so poorly! I will never fly Sun Country airlines again! Unreliable and the worst customer service I've ever encountered!

### "disappointed and frustrated"
Unpleasant Experience with Sun Country Airlines' Cancellation Policy. An encounter that left me profoundly disappointed and frustrated. Two days before my trip, I got sick and had to cancel my trip to Florida. While I understand that cancellation policies are a necessity for businesses to run efficiently, I was dismayed by the lack of flexibility shown by Sun Country. They offered me a travel voucher for my flight cancellation, subtracting a $150 fee, which I accepted despite it seeming like a high cancelation fee. I must now book a flight within a year. However, the real bone of contention lies with the rental car I booked through them. Sun Country refused to issue a refund for the rental car since it was less than 2 days from departure, a policy that I find exorbitantly unfair and far from customer-friendly. I also contacted Avis, the rental car company; I discovered they would have only billed me upon car pick-up, indicating that my cancellation incurred no loss on their part. To add to my frustration, I found that the rental car pricing offered by Sun Country was more expensive than alternatives like Expedia or Kayak. It became evident that these other platforms provided better pricing and allowed for cancellation without charges. Reflecting on this experience, I regret bundling auto rental services with Sun Country Airlines. The lack of transparency, customer consideration, and higher costs was disheartening and left a bitter taste. From now on, I will refrain from bundling services with Sun Country Airline, a lesson learned at a steep price. I hope my experience is a cautionary tale for others who value customer service, transparency, and flexibility.

### "Avoid this airline at all cost"
Not Verified |  Avoid this airline at all cost. Missed a flight from Minneapolis to Chicago because the first leg was delayed due to weather. Sun Country kept my $, sold my 5 seats to someone else and could not have been less interested in helping us rebook. Rebooked on Southwest the next day for $1200 for 5 tickets and spend $350 on 2 hotel rooms. Sun Country offered me $25 per ticket for our missed flight. How is this company in business?

### "do NOT pay for overhead bin space"
Do NOT pay for overhead bin space. Paid $45 one-way for overhead bin space. Found out even if you don't pay for overhead bin space you can still use it. So DO NOT pay for overhead space as Sun Country can NOT guarantee you a spot even if you pay.

### "absolute worst experience"
One flight with this company was unfortunately the absolute worst experience I've ever had. This doesn't feel like an isolated experience, every turn within the Sun Country eco-system is littered with incompetence and inefficiency. At the desk, everyone was clueless that I had a lay over. They lost my luggage. Getting in touch with management was the biggest waste of time. No one on the phone or on premise has the slightest clue of what was going on. They sent me their trash voucher, like I would be stupid enough to put myself through their torture again.

### "They simply do not care."
Had to cancel our flight due to weather. This is a situation they could not control. That said, it is not the cancelation, it is how they handled it is where the train came off the tracks. We were stranded in a foreign county and they did not provide any assistance to help us find lodging or grand transportation. It was a challenging situation to say the least. I had requested flight communication via text. They sent and email, which I did not check before leaving our resort for the airport as 7:00 AM. We would have simply stayed where we felt safe if proper communication had occurred. It is their customer service. The worst experience of my life. I strongly advice to spend the extra few hundred dollars and fly Delta. Learn from my mistake. This airline is cheap for a reason. They simply do not care. You will get lip service but zero execution. Trust me, stay away.

### "problems and long delays"
Not Verified |  This airline consistently has problems and long delays. The direct flights are a plus, but hours of delay are typical. It just doesn’t stack up against other airlines, even at the price.

### "never fly this airline again"
Not Verified |  If you have a physical disability, do not expect any help from these people. I am a wheelchair user and this was my first time flying since becoming disabled so I was already nervous. We received 2/10 assistance getting to my seat. When we landed, a flight attendant clapped her hands and said “chop chop, time to get to work” To my mother to assemble my chair and received no assistance obtaining parts from the overhead compartment. Coming back to Florida, we relied on other very nice passengers to hold the flow of people moving so we could get off. My mother had to carry 2 large carry-on bags, a purse, and wheelchair seats and handles all the way to the gate entrance with no help. The attendants coming home were very nice, but should have at the very least held the flow of passengers getting off. We will never fly this airline again.

### "Absolutely terrible"
Not Verified |  Absolutely terrible. These people are a bunch of clowns. Avoid at any cost. 2/2 times flying with this airline, both have been abysmal experiences. First we took off around a half hour late, now for the 2nd time going back, its an hour and counting.

### "had an 11 hour delay"
We had an 11 hour delay and there was no explanation - no other flights from airport were delayed. This caused us to miss a day of work (income) and of course various extra expenses - food and lodging. We were traveling with 2 young children and the late night flight was less than ideal for them. I will not be flying with Sun Country Airlines again unless they make this right.

### "Getting worse and worse"
Not Verified |  Getting worse and worse. Over an hour late taking off with no explanation as to why. Then had an issue with the number of the bags loaded onto the plane VS the number they checked in so delayed again so they could count them all again, an additional 45 minutes from the time were landed until the time we were actually at the gate to deplane, and after waiting another 40+ minutes, there were still no bags at baggage claim. Two other flights before us were also still waiting for their bags The woman announcing info about the baggage over the loud speaker actually said that if anyone had any questions about their luggage to please not come ask her about it but to wait until tomorrow to ask any questions - she was not joking! They didn’t have any ice on the plane for drinks and had no snacks or pretzels. I finally left the airport and will go back tomorrow for my bag as it’ll be at least 3;00 AM before getting home and I have early meetings tomorrow. Thanks Sun Country. This is becoming all to common on your flights.

### "I am disgusted with the way I was treated!"
I wanted to share my current experience with you as I board my flight to Cancun MX this morning. I boarded priority and after getting settled there was no traffic and due to how cold the runway was I urgently needed to use the restroom when I walked to the rear of the plane I asked the flight attendant where the restroom was and was responded to with "they weren't working out there? As if I was an issue and should have used the restroom prior to boarding. As a pregnant woman I was highly offended and she should have been more considerate of people's conditions. I am disgusted with the way I was treated!

### "I will never be using Sun Country again"
As a travel nurse I fly constantly and never in my life have I had as bad of an experience as I had with Sun Country. When my flight was delayed I attempted to call & was hung up on and told to just go to the desk, so I came to the airport 4 hrs early to resolve my flight that was getting in after my layover flight left, they were unable to resolve, when my second flight was also delayed and I was going to be able to make my second flight because of this I attempted to meet with the desk clerk to ensure my luggage would be diverted. The desk was rude, blew me off & said I didn’t know what I was talking about and refused to check on my luggage status as he said ‘you just don’t know how it works, it will get there’. Upon arriving to my destination my luggage was in fact lost lost and I was left with nothing in a city that’s not my home. Contacting sun country was again met with difficulties and when I did reach someone I was told there’s nothing we can do call back tomorrow. When my luggage was eventually located, they refused to send it to my house as other airlines have done, and I instead had to arrive at the airport and wait for the carousel to get my luggage, I was told to check in at the desk prior and no one was at the desk for 45 mins. As a frequent flyer you’ve lost a customer because I will never be using Sun Country again

### "charge me for my computer 60$"
I was flying from MSP to BWI. I had my carry-on and my computer. Sun country agent decided to charge me for my computer 60$. Since I’m traveling, this is a first time I have an issue with my computer. My wife was telling me that this company is the worst in the USA. I realize this in fact.

### "the worst customer services"
We are traveling on four, in which only 3 of luggage, one is a pack back, and two are small carry-on. When we travel from Minneapolis to Las Vegas, we carry the same luggage and were not charged, why do we get charged when we fly back from las Vegas to Minneapolis? When we check in through the desk, the lady didn't inform to use to pay for the carry-on need to pay. This is the worst customer services, money eater airline!

### "employees very polite and helpful"
Not Verified |  I read a lot of negative reviews about this airlines (lost luggage, rude employees, late or cancelled flights). We flew to Orlando and back this past week. I found the employees very polite and helpful. Our luggage did not get lost. The flight coming back from Orlando was late (30 minutes) due to weather, so that was understandable. My only issues is the width of the seats. I'm a thin woman and I had only about 1.5 inches of seat space on each side. I think any man or people with a few extra pounds on them would be very uncomfortable sitting in such narrow seats.

### "Very polite and extremely helpful"
Not Verified |  I would like to give a great review for Alexis Hayes at Sun Country in Minneapolis Airport. First time flying with my service dog, I missed my original flight and she helped us get a new flight, with no issues. Very polite and extremely helpful.

### "seats were very comfortable"
Not Verified |  We flew on Sun Country from Minneapolis back to Denver it was one of the funniest flights I have ever been on. Our pilot was very friendly - he was retiring his entire family joined him on his final flight. The seats were very comfortable and our flight departed and arrived on time.

### "Poor service"
Poor service. It was freezing, a lot of people complained. Very uncomfortable. Also, The jet way did not work, and this exact problem occurred on the same exact jet way the last time we took this flight about 3weeks earlier.

### "would never fly this airline again"
Had such high expectations prior to takeoff and 5 minutes in and I knew I would never fly this airline again after 10 years as a customer. Every flight attendant was so rude and outright disrespectful that at first I thought it was a joke. Absolutely appalled by how terrible the staff was. Could not wait to get off that plane. I have never been made to feel so uncomfortable. I never said one word to the staff. If this is how you treat paying customers than you shouldn’t even be in operation. So long Sun Country, see you again never. Also, my seatbelt was completely upside down.

### "They take absolutely no responsibility"
Not Verified |  I got to the airport 1 hour and 30 minutes early with only a carry on and they couldn't print out my boarding pass. The employee had to call IT and their supervisor. They finally issued a manual pass 35 minutes before my flight was supposed to depart. Ended up getting all the way through to the plane, being told i would make it, just to get there and be told that no one authorized to hold the plane. I sat there for 15 minutes watching my plane just sit there before starting to move. The employees are no help either. They told me to call customer service and that they've been noted of everything that happened. The service rep told me that the only note was they issued me a manual pass when I got there (a hour and a half early) and that it was my fault that I missed it. Again, they issued me the manual ticket 35 minutes before my flight was supposed to depart. They take absolutely no responsibility and said they don't need to refund the flight or the hotel for the extra night I'd have to stay because i didn't get there 2 hours early. Even the employee who wrote me the manual ticket said none of this was my fault but i could not find him afterwards for him to tell the rep.

### "We will never fly Sun Country again"
Not Verified |  I was trying to check online since check in bags are less expensive, for some reason, the airline website does not allow. Meaning, the airline wanted us to pay a more terrible price for the baggage. It is business and I think it is where big income for them comes in - check in luggage. We will never fly Sun Country again.

### "strongly discourage you from booking"
Not Verified | Seattle to Cincinnati via Minneapolis. We booked four first flight with Sun Country in June. Our son was excited because he's an aspiring pilot and he had never flown with Sun Country before. The night before our flight I looked up the flight information to get the gate and found out the flight had been cancelled. Not sure when it was cancelled, but it was after we had checked in earlier in the day. Because we were in Seattle the customer service desk was already shut down for the day so we had to wait until the next morning to get help. The customer service rep was very kind and helpful (the only reason to give an average customer service rating). She confirmed the cancellation was due to crew issues. The next available flight for our family was in 7 days which is obviously not a valid option. She did offer a full refund and we have received that. But we had to rebook 5 new tickets for the next day which also added another hotel night and rental car day. It cost us an additional $2500. The flight experience may be perfectly fine, and I do believe the rep did everything she was allowed to do. But if you are booking with them be fully aware you could be stranded or incur a significant expense if your flight is cancelled and they aren't able to offer a timely replacement. Many other airlines have multiple flight options (even 1 or 2 day delays would have worked) or travel partners they could send you on other airlines. I strongly discourage you from booking with Sun Country.

### "had a very bad experience"
Wish I had checked reviews here first. I also had a very bad experience with this airline. 6 hours before my flight was scheduled to depart at 6pm, Sun Country sent a text message informing me that my flight had changed until the following day. How does Sun Country expect customers to manage this? Other airlines that I have flown with have always at least offered a hotel/meal voucher as well as a generous flight voucher to compensate at least a little for the added expenses and time wasted. I calculated the loss of a day’s work, additional day of hotel/meal/rental car/pet boarding/airport car parking expenses to be $751. After waiting for 3 hours to talk to a customer service rep, a $100 flight voucher to be used within a year was offered. How does $100 back to Sun Country and the additional revenue they gain from me purchasing a future flight with them help with the $751 dollars of additional expenses that I now have? Never plan to fly on Sun Country again. Strongly discourage others from trying to “save” money with this airline. Spend a more upfront and fly Delta or a reliable customer-focused airline instead.

### "the worst flying experience of my life!"
Not Verified |  Flying with Sun Country was the worst flying experience of my life! They left my husband and I and our two young daughters stranded in Minneapolis because they told us our flight was delayed 17 hours and we would then be flying out at midnight. I received no notification of this occurrence. After getting a hotel room I called Sun Country and found out that we were told the wrong information and our flight was actually on time and had already departed. The next Sun Country flight available wasn't until 4 days later! The only way to get us home was to book a flight through Delta for $2800! Sun Country refused to do anything to compensate for this when it was admitted by them that it was their fault! I would highly encourage people to never fly through Sun Country!

### "recommend avoiding this airline"
I can’t even begin to explain how horrible my experience with Sun Country has been. They lost my bag on a one-way flight from Minneapolis to Vancouver. I understand that mistakes happen, however it was the poor customer service on behalf of the airline that really floored me. Every single employee I spoke with to try and locate my bag was unhelpful, uninformed, and in some cases just plain rude. It took over 24-hours to discover that my bag was put on the wrong flight and ended up in Orlando. They refused to collaborate with any other airlines to get it flown to Vancouver in a timely manner and insisted that Saturday would be the earliest they could send it on the next Sun Country flight (although I arrived on Wednesday so that’s looking at 4 days without my bag although they knew were it was). I had to provide my contact information 4 times to 4 different customer service agents - it seemed like they had absolutely no tracking system for information and/or baggage. After spending hours on the phone during my vacation and being assured several times that my bag would be delivered to me once it arrived on Saturday, it finally arrived on Saturday and I was informed that Sun Country doesn’t have agreements in place with any of the delivery carriers at the Vancouver airport so they could not in fact deliver it to me. I spent another 2+ hours to travel to the airport to pick it up, where I was met with empty Sun Country desks and an airport information desk employee who insisted there was nothing he could do to help although my bag was at that very same airport. As of right now, Sun Country has only agreed to reimburse me for my checked bag fee and the clothes I had to purchase for the time without my bag. I would recommend avoiding this airline at all costs!

### "never fly with Sun Country again"
Not Verified |  This airline is the absolute worst. I have a credit so did make a reservation for a nonstop flight in Feb 2023 but ended up on hold with their customer service department for over 2 hours and never did get someone to pick up the line. I would not have needed to call if they had not make a mistake on my credit from last December. I will chose my future destinations where relying on Sun Country for a nonstop flight is not necessary. Will never fly with Sun Country again. Family members have had the same horrific experience with Sun Country, getting to the gate with small children and no plane there and no rush once one does come in. Late departures and arrivals are the norm for this airline. They filed for bankruptcy in 2008 and could end up doing so again with such terrible service.

### "had a horrible experience"
Our luggage never made it to our destination and is still at large 2 weeks later. There was some chaos when we checked our bags. We’ve had a horrible experience with this airline, it’s run very poorly.

### "Avoid Sun Country at all costs"
Not Verified |  Terrible experience. We were scheduled to leave out on a 7 am flight. Received an email at 10 pm the night before that the flight was delayed 6 hours. Luckily we happened to check the email. We logged in and the sun country website said the flight was on time and not delayed. Called customer service and what a terrible customer service experience. They could not confirm either way if it was delayed or not. We arrived at the airport for the 7 am flight just to be safe. The agents at the ticket counter told us the flight was on time so we checked our bags and went thru security only to find out once inside that it was actually delayed 6 hours. Now we were stuck and couldn’t leave. We were stranded for 6 hours when we could have gone back home and waited if they had given us correct information. We live 30 minutes from airport. The delay caused us to lose deposits on scheduled activities because we didn’t arrive on time. I have attempted to contact Sun Country customer service several times and I’m promised a call back but no one ever calls back! Terrible experience. Avoid Sun Country at all costs!

### "Fly a different airline"
Not Verified | Minneapolis to Tampa. Canceled our flight home on a Sunday, zero flights available, scramble to find hotel, had to rent a different car, 6 people unable to work on Monday, Monday: boarded plane noticed the extra heat aboard as we were in Florida. Sat in this junk pile with no AC for 30 minutes then pulled out to the runway area to cook for another 15, once in the air still no AC just what seemed to be hot breath blowing. The one crew said I'll go turn it on, but didn’t really do anything. 0/10. Fly a different airline.

### "This airline lost my bag"
This airline lost my bag. I made a claim at the airport and have not received my bag or a call from the airlines. I cannot get a hold of the airline too. It’s complicated to even find a number for them or find where to email them. When I called they told me the volume of calls was to high and hung up on me. If you fly, carry on your bag!

### "Customer service is horrible"
Not Verified |  Customer service is horrible. We left something on the plane when we got off and they would not let us go get it. Thankfully, someone was willing to help us, but when the stewardess brought back our stuff, they proceeded to chew us out right in front of everyone. Worst flight I have ever had. Their seats are very uncomfortable and the online check in is terrible. There is also no communication if your flight is late. Will never fly with them again! !

### "What an incompetent airline and incompetent workers"
Not Verified |  Ridiculous flight crew that canceled a flight literally 5 mins after landing. We all waited over 5 damn hours at the airport because the flight crew claimed it would just be a 3 hour delay. They landed and immediately said the flight is canceled until the following day. I missed an important event as well as wasted time and money on transportation back and to the airport. What an incompetent airline and incompetent workers. I called customer care and the lady was no help. All she did was direct me to their website to fill out some form that was going to take months. Not only that, she hung up on me without letting me know. Suddenly, I was just talking to air. Terrible service, terrible airline.

### "Worst baggage experience"
Worst baggage experience I have ever had. My bag not only took an hour to come out, it was soaking wet all the way through. It was a 4 hour drive after this to find everything stained with whatever was near my bag, my uggs ruined, and not dry socks or underwear. So I file a complaint to be told it wasn’t said at the airport or 4 hours after the flight so it is “invalid”. If thats how a company like this needs to make 40$ so be it will not be flying with them ever again. Paying extra to have my bags ruined and an hour added on to my 15 hour travel day? I don’t think so, never again!

### "A huge lack of customer service"
Not Verified |  My flight took off two hours late and the flight staff said the reason was because “they were waiting for a piece of paper”. The online flight schedule was not updated. It lied and said the flight landed at the normal time, so my ride had to wait at the airport for two hours since they were unaware the flight was delayed. A huge lack of customer service which is unacceptable considering the price I paid for the flight. Definitely fly Delta or Alaska Airlines instead if you can.

### "Worst flights ever"
Not Verified |  Flew Sun Country both ways and was so cold in the plane everyone was complaining but nothing was done. My baggage was lost on my return flight. No one on entire trip was very friendly. Worst flights ever, stay clear of Sun Country.

### "the worst airline to fly for many reasons"
Not Verified |  Sun Country is the worst airline to fly for many reasons. I was kicked off the airplane for switching to an empty seat after the plane doors were closed and locked. Which I then moved back to my original seat when it became an issue to flight attendant. The entire plane was deplaned for no reason. The way the flight attendant was talking to me and treating me was uncalled for on so many levels. I will never fly with Sun Country again!

### "she was efficient and informative!
Not Verified |  My son is flying to his dad's today and I couldn't find his flight. I called Sun Country Airlines on a holiday weekend hoping for help and boy did I get it. Katie was absolutely phenomenal don't ever lose her. Not only was she efficient and informative but she helped calm my nervous mom brain down. Katie thank you so much for making this a seamless and easy process you are amazing.

### "bad culture problem"
Not Verified |  Nashville to Minneapolis. As I was checking in I noticed the rep processing it was new and had questions she referred to another rep that was more experienced. The new rep took my bags and had not labeled them yet. So I made the statement that I would like to see my bags label for check in before I walk away just make sure nothing gets missed. The experienced worker with an attitude said that we are professionals it will be handled. She said it in the most unprofessional condescending way and then walked away. I hope that customer service training will be followed up with this experienced rep. She was certainly teaching the new lady to be a smart mouth just like her. Sounds like a bad culture problem within Sun Country the at has gone unchecked! !

### "the communication is awful"
I would rate 0 stars if it was an option, the communication is awful, 0/10. We got all the way to the gate for our flight home from 5 days in Nashville. We were told by the gate agents in a rude, disrespectful & unprofessional attitude that our flight was delayed until tomorrow evening at 4pm. They stated they didn't care about our flight and that it wasn’t their fault. $100 voucher was issued. The next day we were trying to track our flight to make sure it was on schedule, there was nothing online to updated, no emails were sent, etc. I called Sun Country to confirm the flight as no information was provided. I was on hold for over an hour with no answers. We headed to the airport, we approached the check-in desk (same lady as previous day). Again, in a mean, agitative tone she proceeded to tell us us that we had to pay for our overhead luggage and would cost $90 for two bags. I’ve flown on a plane over 30 times and never paid for overhead luggage. We paid it, as we were told without issue. However, our plane has been delayed over 24 hours without notice. The least the company could do was waive the fee. Instead of telling us our flight was canceled, they worded it as “delayed” to get around their regulations of having to put us on another airplane that had open seats. 24 hours later we land & guess what? No Jet Pilot to connect the airplane to the airport. We were on the ground for 30 minutes with nobody moving. The pilot stated, “I’ve called twice and I cannot get ahold of anyone, it’s not an excuse .. you cannot make this up”. The end of the story is, I will forever choose a more expensive option for another airline than go with this poor service ever again.

### "customer service was terrible"
Working in healthcare as nurses made it extremely difficult to travel, Sun Country Airlines refused to allow any type of extension on our credit and we lost all of our money. All we did was request an extension to book by one week so we could see how the pandemic was going to stabilize. Their customer service was terrible, took 6 weeks to respond, waited on hold for hours and then it would hang up on us. I will never recommend them for not taking care of their customers.

### "Bad customer service"
Not Verified |  Booked recently and was obligated to cancel. Bad customer service. Very rude lady on the other line. Did not apologize when I told her my call dropped previously. Raised her voice at me and did not bring the recording that herself suggested to report.

### "This airlines customer service is deplorable!"
Not Verified |  Purchased a ticket and then contracted COVID. Attempted to contact the airline and could not. Their customer service was overwhelmed and spent several hours over two days trying to speak with someone. Was told to leave a message and they would call back. That never happened. Online was no better. Portions of the website were not operational and you could not reach an area that could either change or cancel a flight. This airlines customer service is deplorable! I would never utilize the services of this so called Airline again, they are terrible. We want a refund and can't even contact the airline. Don't fly Sun Country if you expect any acceptable level of customer service, you will not be pleased.

### "Sun Country has zero integrity"
I booked a flight with them to North Carolina for a long weekend trip two months in advance. Two weeks in advance, they cancelled my return flight and moved everyone to the following day. Although they claimed that they sent out an email notifying all passengers of this change, they did not. I dug through all my inboxes and spam folders, and the only emails I have from them state my itinerary for my original flight. My outgoing flight was delayed 5 different times. When I went to check the status the day of my returning flight I learned that they had changed my return date to the following day. I had to be back for an important meeting, so I ended up having to drive the 15 hours home. When I got home at midnight 24 hours later than I should, I was still receiving delay notifications from their flight home, which had not even departed yet. Whenever I tried to call their general customer service number, it stated, "All lines are busy. Finally, by calling their group booking number, I was able to be transferred to customer service. At which time, they refunded my return flight, but refused to refund my outgoing flight, due to that fact that I had already taken it. I asked to be transferred to a supervisor and told him this was not right because I never would have taken the outgoing flight if I knew they wouldn't get me home on time. I warned him that I would make a complaint to the BBB if he did not remedy this. He said that he as unable to help me, and that as the liaison for Sun Country's BBB affairs, I would receive the same response here. Sun Country has zero integrity.

### "Avoid at all costs"
Awful airline. Avoid at all costs. All day long my phone has gone off every hour to notify me that my flight has been delayed. Awaiting the inevitable cancelation but they won't do it until they delay me at the airport until midnight. I wouldn't fly this airline again if I was given free tickets.

### "Wonderful airline to travel"
Not Verified |  Wonderful airline to travel. Flight crew was available, friendly and approachable on both flights. I am a nervous flier, and they made me feel comfortable throughout the flight. Will always fly with this airline in the future when we decide to take trips to Laughlin! Love this airline! Thank you again!

### "labeled my daughter as a non-US citizen"
Not Verified |  Sun Country labeled my daughter as a non-US citizen, despite her US passport and citizenship for 17 years . She was adopted as an infant. Sun Country refused to let her check in online and told me that because she was adopted from China - a gate agent would have to "Verify she was really a citizen". Apparently gate agents know more than the US government?! We traveled with 10 people, only my daughter was required to undergo a "Special check in" process that added burden to our trip but also made her feel like she was not accepted as a citizen here by Sun Country and as if she had to prove herself to a gate agent. This is racist. It also happened on way back. We have not been able to get anyone to acknowledge this issue.

### "The staff on the way back were rude"
Usually I can take a carry on and did on my way to Florida but on the way back they charged me for my carry-on and told me only backpacks were allowed. Then when I went to pay they said they couldn’t take cash it had to be a card. I’ve never been treated so badly at the stand. They didn’t help guide anyone and when booking the flight months earlier they didn’t prewarn anyone this would happen. The staff on the way back were rude. Totally different then my flight there they helped when not sure where to go and did not charge me for my carry on which was 45 dollars I think they were just being greedy on the way back.

### "lack of concern for their customers"
We booked a ski trip to Bozeman with a return on Sunday morning 2/27/22. However, three weeks prior to our trip S.C. canceled our return flight without explanation. Most likely they just didn't think the flight was full enough. They booked us on their evening flight for that day. So instead of a return flight at 10:30 AM we were stuck with a return of 7:30 PM. This of course caused lots of headaches with car rentals, hotel check out times, etc. On the day of our return, we got a notice that our flight was delayed until 8:30. Then an hour prior, we got another notice that our flight was delayed until 9:00 PM. Finally, at about 9:15 PM we departed. Upon landing back at MSP, at midnight, we sat on the tarmac for a full hour without any (none, zero, zilch) communication as to why we were sitting there or what was going on. So instead of getting home at 1:30 PM on Sunday afternoon like we planned, we got home at 2:00 AM Monday morning - and really for no good reason at all. No weather, no mechanical delays, no explanations. Sun Country doesn't appear to care about you. They will cancel your flight on a moment's notice, delay you without explanation and make you sit on the tarmac without any communication. Like most of us, I've had some terrible travel experiences in my day. This one was 100% due to the airlines incompetence and lack of concern for their customers. It's not worth the savings if they can cancel you without explanation and treat you like cattle.

### "Horrible customer service"
Not Verified |  First and last time flying with sun country airlines. Avoid this airlines if possible, this people don’t care about your stuff. I traveled last week and they damaged one of my luggage when I arrived at my destination. After making a huge line in Madison Wisconsin because they only had one staff, with my wife and two toddlers I was told they had no time to help me to fill out a form or call customer service. After arriving at the hotel I called and made the claim long story short of back and forth emails its been over a week and they finally offered me a twenty dollar refund for my close to five hundred dollar luggage. If you have expensive things or care about your stuff stay away from this airline. Horrible customer service!

### "Won’t fly with them again"
Not Verified |  
Worse than Spirit. Delayed flight for two hours after everyone was boarded. Same thing on the way home. They then proceeded to make us sit on the runway after landing for over an hour. Terrible communication, and added several hours onto traveling on both ends. Won’t fly with them again.

### "avoid this sorry excuse of an airline"
Not Verified | I would avoid this sorry excuse of an airline at all costs. I booked my flight out of SFO - MSP - BOS on 12/30, leaving around midnight. Around 7pm the same day, I get one text saying the flight was going to be delayed 2 hours. Worried about missing my connecting flight, I call their customer service center about 10 times to no avail. I get to the airport early, and their desk isn't even open until 9pm. I talk to the agent, who confirms I will miss my connecting flight from Sun Country, then offers a "refund of flight" or "flight on 1/2 out of MSP. Refund of flight is useless, as all the other last minute flights are 2-3x more expensive. An alternate flight 3 days later is a joke, given Sun Country doesn't offer any hotel accommodations and basically wants to leave a customer stranded in a random city for 3 days. I eat up the cost of an exorbitantly more expensive last minute flight, and follow up with their customer service via email, phone, SNS multiple times. No response for 3 weeks. Then, I get an email saying like "we're really sorry, so as a sign of our commitment to excellent customer service, we've refunded you your original ticket price. This almost feels insulting, that the only remuneration offered is the money for the flight I never got to set foot on due to a malfunctioning or error on Sun Country's part. I call again - maybe 3-4 times because their customer service is impossible to reach. The agent tells me she'll look into it. I get an email a few days later saying "Sorry, we're not going to do anything. They don't care about their customers. They don't care about their commitments or flight schedules. They are definitely not a well-functioning airline, and they are hardly a business at all run based on a modicum of common sense. I would avoid this sorry excuse of an airline at all costs - nobody could even pay me to take their rides.

### "What a blessing"
Not Verified | Montego Bay to Fargo via Minneapolis. What would we have done without the kindness, professionalism and graciousness of the staff at Montego Bay, Jamaica? After Delta stranded us, we ran to Sun Country and were able to get on their flight toward home. We had to leave Jamaica that day, no exceptions, to comply with Covid tests-negative that America requires to get back into America (which is fine until an airline tells you your flight is cancelled.) I don't have their names but all the Sun Country staff on December 29th, 2021 reassured us "Yes, we can accommodate you and your family". What a blessing they were to us. So, thank you, Sun Country staff in Jamaica. We are home now, safe and sound. We did use Delta for the last leg of our journey and all went fine.

### "I will be reconsidering book with them going forward"
Not Verified |  Boarded 10 minutes late. Sat on the plane for an hour and a half while they loaded mail and waited 20 more minutes for live chickens to be loaded. You don’t book a 7.50am flight to depart at 9.40 because of mail and chickens. Made everyone late, I will be reconsidering book with them going forward.

### "Horrible first experience"
Horrible first experience. Cabin dirty with food on floor, empty bottles in seat pocket and tray table was sticky. Flight attendants did not care one bit. Rude, arrogant and seemed to be bothered by advising uncleared areas.

### "left the passengers behind"
San Diego to Minneapolis. I had a flight to SY408 to Minneapolis that never showed up at the gate. They shipped my luggage to Minneapolis and left the passengers behind. I received updates of a flight delay and the attendant confirmed there will be a delay but the flight will leave from the same gate. Even after the confirmation, since the terminal is small, I would have seen if it changed gates so I presume they never even stopped to pick anyone up. After several hours on the phone, they told me I had to book and pay for another flight and there was nothing they could do. They also refused to look into the situation and see if there was a gate change, if they did leave all the passengers behind, or what happened with the flight. Still a mystery that they haven't been able to help with.

### "There was no explanation for this cancellation"
Not Verified |  I am disgusted with Sun Country airlines and highly recommend avoiding this airline. Yesterday (12/31/21), I drove my 19 year old daughter and her cousin for a 9.30 pm flight. They were told everything was on time, but were then notified the flight was cancelled shortly before they were supposed to board. There was no explanation for this cancellation. I drove back up to get them and they rescheduled for the next day. After delaying the flight for 1.5 hours, the flight was again cancelled. No explanation. My daughter is devastated as she has been waiting a long time for this trip. I will never use this airline again.

### "unfortunate way to spend new years eve"
Our flight was supposed to depart at 9:30pm on New Years Eve. At 9:07pm some people received a text message saying the flight was canceled. It took them another 10 minutes to make an official announcement that the flight was canceled. At this point, there was still no front desk person for is to ask questions too. We had to travel down 6 gates to talk to someone. They offered a refund to everyone and you could reschedule your ticket for another sun country flight. The choice was 9:30pm the next day (Saturday), which was rapidly filling as were towards the end of the line, or late Sunday. After waiting in line for 40 min and only having moved forward 3 people we decided that we would never fly with Sun Country again. We paid $500 to fly with Delta instead. Money well spent. Sun country was not willing to offer us anything; free hotels, free transportation, shoot, they wouldn't even cover our parking fee for the one day delay. Sun Country does not care about their customers. They are the cheapest airline and it shows. Their customer phone lines were also just a robot that says "All lines are busy, please look at the website. Good bye" and then hangs up on you. Extremely unfortunate way to spend new years eve.

### "lack of communication was the most frustrating thing"
Not Verified | We were supposed to fly out at 7 pm. At about 6:30 there were no employees at the desk. Our flight was still listed as on time. Another passenger found that the airline website listed the new departure time as 10 pm, though nobody else was able to find it. We were never notified at any point by email or text. The scheduled time remained 7 pm and eventually the status was changed to 10 pm, but the flight was never listed as delayed. At about 9 pm the poor staff member had to announce to everyone that the flight would not be taking off that night, but at noon the next day because the pilot needed to rest. It took another hour for the airline to confirm a hotel for everyone and we all had to pay for transport with the promise of the airline reimbursing this eventually. Once they finally confirmed a hotel they did not even announce it, we had to hear it from other customers. It was all very confusing. The lack of communication was the most frustrating thing. Today at 11:15 our scheduled departure time is still 7:05 yesterday; it was never listed as delayed.

### "They still refused and would not give me a credit"
Not Verified |  I booked a flight with Expedia for my son to come home for his grandfather's funeral. The flight out was with American Airlines. The return leg was Sun Country. American's flight out was delayed to the next day. He was flying from San Diego to Indy. Due to the delay, he was now going to miss the funeral. We then canceled the flight since he was going to miss the entire funeral mass. American Airlines refunded the flight out but Sun Country stated they have no refund policy with canceled flights. Our intention was for my son to come to his Grandfather's funeral. I sent Sun Country the funeral info. They still refused and would not give me a credit. I will never book with an airline that operates their business in this way. Expedia did finally give me a credit after hours of calls and being on hold.

### "They refused to forward our bags"
We paid an additional $100 each (x2) for Sun Country Door-Door service which included pick-up from home to airport and assistance checking our bags through to our destination in Costa Rica. Shockingly, our bags never arrived. Sun Country admitted that our bags were not placed on the aircraft and advised that we could pick them up in Minneapolis on our return in 1 week. Imagine, no clothes, toiletries, meds, snorkel gear etc. They refused to forward our bags as they only fly to Liberia once a week. They made no effort to utilize another carrier. Strongly advise that you avoid this new, dysfunctional "Door to Door" service (provided by Landline Services) and be aware of Sun Country policy regarding your misplaced luggage.

### "What a joke of an airline"
I would give this airline a 0 if I could. We are very displeased with the service that we have had this past week with this airline. This was supposed to be a special trip for our honeymoon as we have recently been married. It started out great in Denver, Colorado and we get everything checked in at the airport and paid money for the checked bags. Our first flight was delayed due to, “they couldn’t find the plane” is what we got told over the intercom. The flight was delayed about 40 minutes for that, and delayed another 20 minutes for the passenger who threw up before take off. We then missed our connection flight which was serviced by the same airline. Sun Country. They knew we were coming and didn’t wait 10 minutes for the 3 (2 in my party and one other man going to Myrtle beach) of us. They got us on the soonest flight with Southwest and reassured us multiple times that our bags would be sent to our final destination. We asked 3 people to make sure and even checked baggage claim and we were told that it would be ok. We arrive in Myrtle beach to no bags and no contact from anyone from this airline. We have been working with a Southwest agent to get the information. We have spent the last 4 days in Myrtle Beach with absolutely no luggage thanks to you guys. It took me hours to try and get a hold of you guys. And when I finally did you guys weren’t happy or trying at all to get us our bags. Our honeymoon was absolutely ruined and now they only want to reimburse half of the money we spent on essential needs. What a joke of an airline.

### "I was pleasantly surprised"
Not Verified |  This was my first time flying with Sun Country and I was pleasantly surprised. The plane was a bit old (but not to the point of being concerning), just not the bells and whistles you get with a bigger airline. The flight attendants were friendly and made an effort to talk with passengers and were quick to help those with children. Overall, I think Sun Country is a value and will definitely fly with them again!

### "probably one of the best experiences"
Reading the reviews for this flight before we left on our trip I was a nervous wreck expecting something to go wrong. After my experience with this company I felt it was important to leave a review for those like me that have severe flying anxiety. My first interaction with this company after booking happened when I noticed that I failed to put middle names on my booking so our boarding passes would not match our passports. I called the service number and left my call back number. I had already read that no one answers the phone so I was prepared to be disappointed by not receiving a call back. A couple of hours later a young lady called me back and I explained my mistake. Her response was "Well let's get that corrected so you can be at ease have a great trip. She corrected 4 middle names on my booking and emailed me a new itinerary while staying on the phone with me to make sure everything looked ok. Disaster averted. We then got to the airport on Sunday to find out our flight was delayed. Again, after reading the horror stories of delayed flights being cancelled and people being left to fend for themselves I began to feel very high anxiety. One of my adult children would be flying from a different airport but same airline into Mexico and I was afraid she'd be in Mexico by herself. The flight was an hour late but finally showed up, they very calmly unloaded the passengers coming into Houston and got us all on the plane as quickly and well organized as I've ever seen. The flight attendants personally apologized to the passengers as we boarded for being late explaining that there were severe storms at their last stop and that they had to wait it out. I don't even know where to begin about our experience with our flight home. From Mexico, coming back into America, you must check in at the counter to show your negative covid test. Of all the check in counters, it was the shortest line, the staff was friendly and very patient with everyone, and they went above and beyond to help us get checked in and to our terminal in time. Wonderful service. I have flown on several airlines and take several trips a year and this is probably one of the best experiences I have had flying (that included set backs). There's a lot of bashing this airline for things that anyone could avoid just by doing their research or reading their booking information. The seating is no different than other airlines. The drinks come with a cup of ice just like every other airline. Oh there's phone chargers on the backs of the seat legs which I have never seen before. That was cool. We got free WiFi. Being surprised by carry on and check bag fees baffles me. This isn't uncommon. Check these things BEFORE you book and there will be no surprises with this airline. If you are flying from Houston out to Mexico this is the way to go.

### "no enforcement of that policy"
Not Verified |  We flew round trip to Anchorage from Minneapolis. The airline was good about telling people they need to wear a mask over their nose and mouth at the beginning of each flight, but then there was no enforcement of that policy. On our return home, there was one guy with his mask on his chin, not covering nose and mouth, that chatted with the flight attendants for a long period of time, yet he was not told to use his mask properly. Many, many others not covering nose and mouth. I appreciate that wearing masks was not previously the responsibility of flight attendants. Well, I am sorry, but it is now. All of the flight crew is responsible for the safety of the passengers, including the protection against the spread of Covid 19. I would definitely not use this airline until they carry out their responsibility to keep their passengers safe. In addition, we waited by the luggage carousel for over an hour before the luggage came.

### "attendants were friendly and helpful"
My flights to and from San Antonio to Cancun were on time. The flight attendants were friendly and helpful. Prices are low and I will be flying Sun Country Airlines again.

### "refuse to answer your phone calls"
They refuse to answer your phone calls (have been calling for the last three hours). They not only don't have the information from my itinerary, even though they emailed me the itinerary number and confirmation code. This is so embarrassing and such a waste of money to fly this airline. They take your money and don't provide any customer service after taking your money. When we got on the phone, they hung up.

### "Never again Sun Country"
Not Verified |  Terrible, always being delayed. Twice within a month apart our flight was delayed. We are currently sitting on the plane before take off, we've been sitting here for over an hour because of weather. If the flight wouldn't have been delayed we would have beaten the storm and taken off on time. Never again Sun Country!

### "Continue doing an amazing job"
Thanks for having staff like Khiry Morgan. Today 7/30 was my first time flying with Sun Country Airlines. Unfortunately I came in contact with multiple agents at Sun Country Airlines that was absolutely rude. Khiry Was not one of them. His energy was amazing and he completely saved the experience. As a customer service manager at the MSP airport I have very high expectations for customer service and Khiry exceeded those expectations. Continue doing an amazing job. It definitely isn’t going unnoticed !

### "Worst airline experience"
Not Verified |  Absolute worst airline to take. Got split up with my family and had to take a plane by myself or my boyfriend had to pay over $100 to change his flight to my later flight and let the rest of them go without us. They were no help whatsoever at the airlines checking. They said I had to call and they can’t do anything. We are in Mexico and I’m from the US so we weren’t able to call the airline. They couldn’t call them either so we were forced to pay them extra so I didn’t have to take the plane by myself. I will never use this airline again. Next time, I will go with American Airlines and pay a more. This wasn’t worth all the time, stress, and confusion. Worst airline experience and worst customer service.

### "Staff are absolutely incompetent!"
Not Verified |  Checked one bag... when we arrived in Seattle, we were delayed maybe 15 minutes before getting to baggage carousel. Nothing on carousel. Called Sun Country. Took several attempts to speak with anyone. They have our bag, but we can't pick it up until the next day, will you deliver it to our hotel? No. Had to make a trip back to airport the next day to get it. Then, similar experience on return flight. No apology whatsoever. Staff are absolutely incompetent! Would not fly Sun Country again even if it was free!

### "I will never fly Sun Country again"
We arrived hours early enough to get in line. We were met by the apocalypse! There was a huge long line that was never ending. We got in line and were in line for two hours. This was the line to check a bag NOT security. There was such mayhem that they eventually just starting calling out flights and having people jockey to get up to drop bags so that the plane could leave. This turned into one giant cluster. Everyone was pushing and there was no line. To top it off they were not fully staffed to handle the number of flights that were departing. I have never seen such incompetence in my life and I fly often. I will never fly Sun Country again. They knew their flight schedule and number of passengers ahead of time and could have planned accordingly.

### "4 weeks since Sun Country Airlines lost my luggage"
I probably don’t have to tell you how angry I am! It has been 4 weeks since Sun Country Airlines lost my luggage! I have called a million times, listed all my items, provided what receipts/proof I could and they sent me an email saying I need to send receipts! Who keeps receipts for all their personal belongings? I will never fly with them again!

### "didn’t let me fly"
Not Verified |  I had a flight from Houston to Cancun on July 15th. I called the airline before my flight date and asked them about additional documents I need to bring. They told me that I don’t need any additional documents just my passport and my green card. When I arrived to the airport and about to check in at the kiosk the representative that was on the kiosk told me that “You are going to miss your flight” without any explanations first. He told me that I need an additional form and didn’t let me fly. I called them and asked them about additional documents before and they told me that I need only my passport and my green card and I would be fine. He made me miss my flight instead of helping me with my documents. Any other airlines let me know that my passport and my green card would be fine. Because of Sun Country Airlines lack of customer service I bought a new ticket for the same day and paid extra money for it when I already had a flight that I paid for. Why any other airlines are not asking for the additional documents and let me fly? I called the customer service number before my flight and they confirmed that with my passport and my green card I would be okay to fly so because of their lack of knowledge and support I spend 13 hours in total on a plane and airports.

### "I never got my money back"
Had flight planned for spring break last year, but had to cancel due to pandemic. After months of following up, I finally got money back for my trip in the form of credit I could use on their site. I tried going on multiple flights earlier this year, but there were limited options for return flights, so I was unable to use my credit until May. When I tried using the credit it had supposedly "expired less than a few days before. Not once did I receive any confirmation suggesting the credit would expire. $130 vanished into thin air. Even after complaining to customer support and better business bureau, I never got my money back.

### "Do not get the Priority seating"
Not Verified |  I got the priority seating. Paid extra for it. It was fine in Mineapolis to Raleigh Durham cause I went through TSA quicker but leaving Raleigh it made no sense. There was absolutely no difference. Do not get the Priority seating. The airline staff said I basically wasted my money. Thanks Sun Country! You will not be missed!

### "worst Airline that I ever have dealt with"
This is the worst Airline that I ever have dealt with. The worst on all customers service level. From baggage check in, flight boarding gates to, on the phone customer service to baggage claim. even their supervisor don’t know what customer service is. It is just to explain why, they are the worst ever.

### "they say we can't and wont rebook you"
Not Verified |  We got 14 people ready to go on this flight with 3 kids and one toddler. Took 5 hours to leave house with kiddos Plus another 2.5 hour delay at DFW. Then flights cancelled because "the pilot went over hours". Thats not the worst part, then they say we can't and wont rebook you at the gate or the check in terminal with sun country or any other airline, you have to call and number. 8 people in our group called, on hold for over 2 hours, gave up and went home. Lost 9 hours, a trip to Mexico, 21 total wasted days of paid time off, and couldn't get to Mexico because of there absolutely terrible service. I talked to the manager at DFW airport myself and he said what do you expect from a low budge airline. I told him at least help us rebook and he said they dont do that.

### "told me the credit is expired"
Not Verified |  This airline sent me an email that said I had a flight credit for a cancelled COVID flight. The email didn’t have any details. Everything is now open, so I called back to use the credit. They told me the credit is expired. They said they made a policy to hard cancel credits May 31st, 2021. I ask did they send any notice out, and the supervisor told me it is the traveler’s responsibility. How in the heck can I be responsible for their cancellation date? How in the heck would a reputable company not send out a notice of their policy, with the credit. I think this airline is a joke! In the small scale, it is $90! But, I wonder how many people they cheated out of $90+?

### "lack of efficiency, lack of response, lack of resources to aid customers"
Supposed to return to DFW on July 1, 2021. They told us it was delayed. No problem. We get there, the SY staff informs us it's cancelled and if we need a hotel. We declined and asked our next steps, they told us to just go home and wait for an email and said they were unable to book flights - mildly frustrating. I understand flights get cancelled, but the staff essentially told us to just go home and wait for someone to reach out to us, which still hasn't happened in over 14 hours. Been on hold with SY for over an hour, put my number into the "call back" list over 8 hours ago and haven't received any call back - extremely frustrating. We receive an email saying we'll get a voucher for a new flight within 10 business days - absolutely unacceptable. A couple of extra days? Sure, maybe. 10 business days stranded is just plain wrong. No other phone number works, so I went back to the airport to get some additional information. All of the staff left. No SY agent anywhere in the airport. As of right now, we are stuck at our current destination with no idea of when we can return to DFW, as we haven't heard anything and cannot get a hold of anyone to help us with our issue. The unprofessionalism, lack of efficiency, lack of response, and lack of resources to aid customers is disappointing. I can say with confidence, I will never fly with this airline again. I've had other flights cancelled with American and other airlines, and they handled it with haste and professionalism - I have seen neither here.

### "I was so disappointed"
Not Verified |  I am writing based on an a poor experience I had with a Sun Country Airlines flight credit/voucher. Back in January 2020 I had made a flight reservation for my family from Denver to Minnesota for May 7, 2020. However because of the safety and health concerns and overall halt of essentially all activities related to the COVID pandemic, Sun Country offered me the opportunity to cancel my flight and for which I was issued a credit for future use. I was very pleased and grateful at the level of customer service Sun Country offered in such uncertain times-outside of anyone's control. However on June 28, 2021 as we are exiting the pandemic and the CDC has advised it is safe to travel again, I went to use my airline credit, only to find out that the credit has expired. After waiting for over an hour on the phone to talk to a customer service rep, I was met with hostility and an absolute disregard and resounding lack of accommodation or alternative to my situation. I consider traveling by air an expensive privilege and one that I am extremely grateful for but one I do not have the luxury of doing so very often. I am also conscious of cancelation/rescheduling charges and terms during normal times but during these unprecedented times, I think it is so important for businesses to value their customers and vise versa. I was so disappointed at the lack of transparency by Sun Country when this credit was issued and I was not fully informed that the credit would expire. The lack of transparency by Sun Country coupled with the uncertainty of traveling until deemed safe by CDC and federal officials made planning future plans almost impossible and now that it seems like the nation is in the clear, Sun Country has made it unattainable for me. The lack of regard, customer service and appreciation for its customers during this critical time is why I am reluctant to use Sun Country again. If this is how Sun Country is treating all of its customers during this time, its a shame.

### "refused to give a refund"
Not Verified |  My partner and I booked a flight with Sun Country last year. The flight had to be cancelled a couple months later due to COVID. Sun Country told us that, because of the pandemic, they couldn't offer us a refund and would have to give us a flight credit instead. We were not told about an expiration date, and were not given any extra confirmation or verification for this credit. I called customer service recently to look up my credit, and it had supposedly expired a month prior. I was told there was nothing I could do about this. Sun Country took our money, cancelled our flight, refused to give a refund, and is now refusing to let us reschedule. Reading other reviews, I see I am not the only one having this experience. Sun Country needs to make this right.

### "I was so disappointed in this whole experience"
We have flown Sun Country for years and have always had pretty good experiences. Well, that officially ended today. We booked a short trip before the pandemic to get a little break from our toddler before our second baby came. We never actually went on the trip though: Sun Country cancelled the flight because of the pandemic. Fine. We understood. My husband immediately called Sun Country to see if we could get a refund. They refused but did send us an email about an electronic credit we could use toward a future booking. There was nothing in the email about the credit expiring. Today, I tried to use the credit toward a new flight. The website said the voucher was worth $0. So I called the helpline and spent over two hours on hold and speaking to two different agents (after getting hung up on by the first one when being "transferred" to a supervisor). First they tried to say we couldn't use the credit because their records showed that my husband had cancelled the flight, which isn't true. We booked through Bookit.com, and they sent us an email saying they would cancel the flight within the next 7 days if Sun Country didn't cancel it first. My husband didn't call until the flight was actually cancelled. Once we had that established, they said it didn't matter because the credit was only valid for a year from the date it was issued. I told them the email we received about the credit had no expiration date or even a disclaimer that it would expire at all. They said they sent two more emails about it expiring, which we conveniently never received. After getting hung up on by the first agent who was supposed to be transferring me to her supervisor, I had to call back and wait on hold for another 30 minutes to start the whole process over again with a new agent, who said her supervisor had reviewed our case and denied the credit, so she wouldn't even speak to me. I told the second agent I was so disappointed in this whole experience that we wouldn't be flying with them in the future, and she said, "I understand. Is there anything else I can help you with? Yep-you can transfer me to Delta Airlines. And please don't hang up on me this time.

### "this will be my last time flying with this company"
Not Verified |  The plane landed and the company sent the bags to the wrong baggage claim, somehow sent it to Spirit Airline baggage claim, and as a result two of our bags were either taken or never showed up. This was my first experience with this company, and it is needless to say this will be my last time flying with this company. I would give this a zero star review if it was possible.

### "not clear on it's COVID cancellation voucher expiration"
Not Verified |  This airline is not clear on it's COVID cancellation voucher expiration. I did not receive any notification on the expiration for rebooking my flight and now have lost the flight completely. I don't know how good this airline is in reality but you know, I'll never find out. I will never book another flight with this airline again. I would suggest others to steer clear of Sun Country Airlines as well.

### "tray table was very dirty"
My tray table was very dirty Kleenex stuffed inside and the table was dirty. I told the flight attendant she said I think we are out of wipes and walked away and did not come back or said anything more. T guy in the next row asked for a wipe and he got one right away - not happy.

### "I’m so done with this airline"
I’m so done with this airline, I wouldn’t fly it if it’s the only option I have. The employees clearly hate their jobs and treat the customers very poorly. I had a woman yell at me as I was standing with my parents while they were checking in because we were traveling together. She was the only one checking bags and moving at a snails pace which caused my parents to miss their flight because they were 2 minutes late in checking their bags. Then neglected to tell them they would be flying standby the following day. This is just one example of the customer experience I have had with this airline. Avoid at all costs!

### "We will never fly Sun Country Airlines"
Spoke with an agent to see if I could get a voucher, to fly at a later date, as my husband has Covid. Unable to get a voucher, as agent stated, Sun Country no longer has Covid Rules in place, all customers can fly Sun Country airlines even if you have Covid. So no voucher, but more concerned that the information is not accurate. I only had a one way to MN with Sun Country, my returning flight was with Frontier and I was given vouchers, immediately, 3 of us flying and all given vouchers. I fly to MN many times during the year as does my family flying from MN to Denver. We will never fly Sun Country Airlines. Thanks to Frontier for working with us and slowing us to fly at a later date.

### "This is a really unethical way to stay in business"
Not Verified |  We booked a trip through Priceline. They put us on this airline even though we picked another airline. They pulled a bait and switch. As soon as I got the wrong itinerary, I tried to call these people along with everyone else for four days and could not get a response. It wasn’t until I disputed the charge that anyone called me back. Sun Country basically told me that I was given a credit even though they do not fly anywhere around me so they basically stole my money. This is a really unethical way to stay in business when you are stealing money from people.

### "trying to get a refund on a flight credit"
Good luck trying to contact them, customer service is non-existent. Tried to call trying to get a refund on a $348 flight credit because there is NO flights available that I can remotely use. Travel problems due to COVID from last year? Never ever book with this airline unless you have ironclad travel arrangements because if anything needs to change you’re screwed.

### "Terrible customer service"
On return flight they lost our luggage. Dealing with the customer service is almost impossible, they say they will have someone call you back and they don't. Spent hours over the last week on hold and no help. Received a call from another airline saying they have my luggage and they can't get in touch with Sun Country. I've called and almost had to beg them to take the contact info that the other airline gave me. Terrible customer service, they just don't care. Still don't have my luggage. Won't ever fly Sun Country again!

### "Customer Service was totally non-existent"
Not Verified |  Flight on 04 Feb 21, Departs 8:35 P. Flight SY376, Class S. Flight left one hour late getting us back to Minneapolis after midnight. Flight crew verbally abusive. Head Flight Attendant was always and only about control. Customer Service was totally non-existent. It was replaced by loud abrasive threatening intercom demands repeated throughout the whole flight about the masking policy. It made you feel like the gestapo was trying to control a prison camp. The Head Flight Attendant set the abusive tone and all but one of the other staff followed this  approach. Just doing this review gives me painful memories. We will not be using Sun Country anytime soon.

### "Sun Country said no"
Covid caused my flight to be cancelled. I happily accepted a $461 flight credit to be used at a later date. I fly to Portland every May. Recently, I tried to book a flight and was told that the airline no longer flies to Portland from Nashville due to the pandemic. Ok, so disappointed, but I called and tried to use my credit to fly to Albuquerque, nope. LA, nope. Boston to Phoenix, nope. Gave it my best effort, but now, under the existing circumstances, their airline has shuttered several destinations that would work. So, given this $461 voucher expires in May 2021 I politely asked for a refund, chalk it up to Covid. Sun Country said no! I was in shock and asked to speak with customer care, again no. Last time I will ever fly this airline and hope you heed the advice not to fly them either. We are all suffering the pandemic, flexibility to customers, esp when you change your policies does not appear to exist with Sun Country, fly anyone else!

### "I will 100% fly this airline again"
I was nervous about flying with my two-year-old because I knew that she was going to fight keeping her mask on. I was considering flying Delta because they have a wonderful mask policy for kids and don't seem to be booting toddlers and families off of planes for trying (and failing) to keep masks on. However, Sun Country allowed my daughter to do her best to keep it on (but we weren't kicked off the plane if she just couldn't handle wearing it). I appreciate this more than I can express. We desperately want to travel and see our loved ones that live across the country and are really trying to be respectful (in regards to wearing masks) but it is SO Hard for toddlers to keep them on for hours at a time. I appreciate this airline's empathy and for allowing us to be imperfect. I will 100% fly this airline again and I am telling my friends! I also love that they have the only direct flight from Madison, WI to Seattle, WA. Keep it up Sun Country. BIG fan right here.

### "refused to take any responsibility for the problems they created"
Flyer Beware - Do not try to connect with a different airline to a Sun Country Flight. Sun Country is a Hub to a Vacation Destination airline. This requires any customers who live outside of a reasonable driving distance to the Hub to fly other airlines in order to catch a Sun Country flight. Sun Country needs these customers, they cannot sustain their business on the customers who live close to the hub. The problem is that if there is a delay, Sun Country buries their head in the sand and will tell you that they are not responsible for a miss connection on another airline, even if the reason for the missed connection is 100% their fault. This is exactly what happened when my family and I flew Sun Country from Mexico to Minneapolis on December 30th, 2020. We were supposed to connect to a Delta flight, and I had scheduled a generous 2.5 hr layover. Our Sun Country flight had 4 delays, though in fairness one was caused by air traffic control. In any event, we should of had enough layover time to recover, but 4 delays on one flight was too much. Sun Country wouldn't even put us up in a hotel for the night, refusing to take any responsibility. The net cost to me was around $1,200 (I had to rebook our Delta tickets at 5x the original price). I wrote to Sun Country to complain, and they sent me an email stating how they "pride themselves on being a reliable travel partner.....and are dedicated to customer satisfaction". They don't care at all, and refused to take any responsibility for the problems they created. I would recommend to anyone traveling to fly the same, conventional airline to your destination. Sun Country isn't that much cheaper, and if things go wrong the other airlines will take care of you.

### "Sun Country is a pure disappointment"
Not Verified |  Absolutely the worst airline with truly bad customer service and policies. Sun Country is a pure disappointment, once the pandemic hit, our flight got canceled, and we never saw our money so $1200 is gone. We tried to work with them on the case and they said "we are a very small airline and we also need money" thus they wont be able to give any money back. Pretty ridiculous, it is not a trust worthy airline, it is a scam airline that tries to build business using money from other people.

### "the customer service is awful"
Do not use Sun Country Airlines. Not only are the seats absolutely uncomfortable but the customer service is awful. I had to purchase new flights to get home from Aruba during the COVID shutdown. Remember when purchasing flights that Sun Country only flies once a week to a lot of countries. Aruba was shutting down borders and restaurants, etc. My flight out wasn't until Saturday so I booked on another airline to leave Thursday. Some airlines had already cancelled flights out and I wasn't sure how reliable Sun Country would be. I called and had credit from the airline for the unused portion however, I wasn't told that the flights expire on the original date of booking, not the date of travel.The agent that also receives the customer complaint forms directly - was extremely rude and unhelpful as well as the woman I spoke to before. It was like they had joy in saying "Sorry I can't help you your credits expired so we won't do anything for you". It is shear madness. I will never use this airline again. The same agent also responds to Facebook complaints so there really isn't any help because he blocks all complaints from moving forward. Never use this airline!

### "people with no masks"
Minneapolis to Fort Myers. I have never seen a worse airline towards COVID. Full plane with kids and people with no masks. No chance I will ever touch this airline again.

### "They do not follow any COVID-19 guidelines"
Horrible. They do not follow any COVID-19 guidelines. Flight attendant did not wear a mask when walking through aisle. Every seat is booked, you can be sitting by complete stranger. The seats/seatbelts/windows are very obviously not wiped down. Do not fly.

### "a terrible experience"
It was a terrible experience. At the time that I made our reservations, Sun Country said that they would leave all center seats empty, that there would be no drink/food service, the planes would be sanitized and passengers were required to wear masks “for the safety of the passengers.” When we boarded the plane, on May 17th, 2020, we found out that Sun Country filled every single seat, only about half of the passengers wore masks, and the planes were not sanitized between flights. Passengers would come off the plane and immediately new passengers were loaded on the plane. The only truth spoken by Sun Country was that there was no beverage or food service and that was yo save Sun Country money—it had nothing to do with passenger safety.

### "misled paying customers"
They misled paying customers by saying they would block all middle seats! Sun Country apparently believes they do not have to follow CDC recommendations for social distancing because they sold every seat on the plane. They suspended in flight service, but they then sold every seat on the plane?

### "doesn't do business fairly"
Not Verified |  Sun Country lost my business for good. I bought airline tickets through them to go to LA in April and of course had to cancel because of the pandemic. I asked an agent and 2 managers to refund my money and they stated their policy was to give airline credits only. I accepted an airline credit and purchased a return ticket home to MSP from PDX on May 17th. Sun Country cancelled my 1 way flight, had no others flying to MSP, then refused to refund my money stating since the ticket was purchased with a flight credit, they cannot refund it. I asked if they could have refunded my money from the LA tickets. The supervisor said yes they could have but she could not refund me since this ticket (for a flight they cancelled) was purchased with the airline credit (that I didn't want in the first place). So now I have to spend more money on airline tickets because Sun Country doesn't do business fairly. I am so disheartened that they didn't do the right thing and refund my money so I could purchase a ticket to get home.

### "worst flight experience"
Not Verified | Palm Springs to San Francisco. Sun Country cancelled our flight and their onsite customer service (who said they were contractors, not employees) was unable to help and told us to call the airline. Of course, none of the passengers could get through, were hung up on by the automated system or left callback numbers and then were never called. After several days of trying to get through to the airlines and get rebooked ultimately had to do it ourselves at the beginning of this pandemic at a much higher cost. We have been trying to get reimbursed ever since and they've continuously lied saying their onsite staff could have helped us and that they called us back. After flying for business and pleasure for the last 30+ years this is by far the worst flight experience and I've flown WOW, Ryanair, and easyJet. That's really saying something.

### "forfeiting my voucher and losing that money"
Not Verified |  Minneapolis to Orlando. I booked a trip for the family over spring break to Florida to spend a day at Disney World, and a cruise and both have been canceled so we have no need for the airfare until we are able to reschedule our trip. I have talked to an agent 4 times and 1 manager. The first agent that canceled our flight told me everything was put back on my voucher the part I used and the rest of the money was placed on an electronic credit. He told me they would both be good until March 20th 2021 because I booked the trip last year and I would get an email with the information within 48 hours. I waited and got no information so not wanting to lose the money I called back and the new agent told me I would lose the voucher on April 9th this year and the credit is only good until November this year, I explained to her I would be unable to use the voucher by April 9th with everything going on. She told me to fill out a complaint form and call back the next day and they would forward my call to team that could help me. I filled out the form right away and called back today, the agent that was helping me said he could fix the voucher and more the experience date out, as I was on hold the phone was disconnected so I called back again and explained to the agent what happened and what he told me he could do. This agent went on and told me there is nothing they can do and I would be forfeiting my voucher and losing that money. I asked to talk to a manager and after asking multiple times they had a manager call me back. the manager said they reviewed the call and the agent gave me bad information and I would be forfeiting my voucher if not used by April 9th per their upper manager. I asked to get a copy of the audio recording and he said I could not get it and there is no one else I can talk to about this. As of right now Sun Country Airlines is stealing my money. If I know what was going to happen with this Coronavirus I would of booked a trip before my kids spring break, but being able to use this voucher I was able to afford a trip for the many this spring break. I would recommend not to use Sun Country Airlines for any travel they just want money and don't care of their customer not to mention they take advantage of this Coronavirus to take money without giving services. FYI I tried using the option 8 to call back and never got a call back so I have sent right around 12 hours to get this information

### "This airline was horrible!"
Minneapolis to Chicago O'Hare. This airline was horrible! We were delayed 1.5hrs on the tarmac for mechanical issues on the first flight. Next, on our flight back, we had a boarding gate set as M1 and 30min before we were to depart, they changed the gate all the way across the airport on the opposite side at M20. Then, we all sat and waited for updates on our flight that was to depart 'on time' and we never received any updates that this flight was now delayed. Wouldn't inform anybody about what was going on and even lied to my face and told me the flight was 15min out. Completely incompetent at their jobs!

### "staff was very rude"
Orlando to Minneapolis. Flight SY342, 2 hour delay at departure Orlando, staff was very rude. On the way to Florida we have the front seats no problem fitst isle, and on the way back seats 31 all the way in the back. I Asked the staff if these seats recline and she says, do they look like it.

### "Extremely disappointed"
Minneapolis to Miami. Extremely disappointed with the customer service we received. We ended up missing our flight due to the staff and process being unorganized. On top of this, the employees were rude and lacked any empathy. We waited for 2 hours in line to check in while they were pulling people from a different line who had waited way less than us.

### "uncaring and incompetence"
Chicago to Minneapolis. Hometown Airline - not. These folks are unbelievable. They took our plane from our low margin route (ORD-MSP) to use on a more profitable route. Then they blamed it on weather even though ORD and MSP were operating normally 7 hours before takeoff. First they updated flight status to delayed. Then delayed + cancelled. Then they sent an email with no instructions on what to do next. 4 phone calls and 4 hours later, finally got a human being who said we were on our own to get home. No alternate flight offered. Absolutely no empathy or compassion. We rented a car and drove 8 hours to get home to take care of our child with medical needs (because we had only arranged care through Sunday night). Literally the only thing Sun Country said was "we sent you an email". Not even Spirit Airlines has that level of uncaring and incompetence.

### "well trained compassionate staff"
A special thank you to the cabin crew Flight SY106 on 2/26/2020. My husband caught the flu while we were on vacation. Needless to say we had no real vacation. He had been feeling Ok. We were in the air maybe 40 min and he lost consciousness that lasted a minute which seemed longer to me! He was dehydrated and on top of that spiked a high fever. The crew was right there with me asking him pertinent questions and had ice packs to cool him down and several cups of beverages and water. The cabin crew stopped in on us frequently the remainder of the flight at least every 10-13 min!! Sun-country you have well trained compassionate staff.

### "my baggage never arrived"
On February 14 I flew from Newark to San Diego to visit my husband who has been deployed. Customer service from the get go was terrible, but I was able to overlook the rude employees, and lack of inflight entertainment because, my flights were on time and I arrived in San Diego in one piece. Turns out my baggage never arrived in San Diego, there was not a single Sun Country employee available in the airport to help me or the 6 other passengers who were missing luggage. Nothing was offered up front, a voucher or even a tooth brush. We called the airline and were told the bag would be expedited and would meet me in San Diego TWO days later, I was only in town for three. It is going on day 14 and I have still not received my luggage, which I am told never actually left Newark airport! However, when I called to say I would just pick the bag up I was told, despite emails saying Sun Country has found my bag, that they can not confirm where the bag is! They will also not reimburse me for the items I had to purchase until I am “reunited“ with my luggage or it has been missing 45 days! The worst part is I have had to call the airline every day and not once received a call from them. I have only received emails while on the phone with customer service or after threatening to file a complaint with the DOT. But even those emails have been vague and offer no follow up. I’m giving them until the end of today to get me some information and then I will file my complaint with the Department of Transportation. Think twice before you fly with this airline and if you do I recommend carry on only!

### "worst customer service"
Not Verified |  Denver to Minneapolis. Flight delays are a normal party off travel. That said, how they are handled speaks volumes about the airline. Sun Country may have the worst customer service of any airline I have dealt with. After three phone calls and two promises that a manager would call me back, nothing. They don't care about taking responsibility for problems they create, and their agents have no problem flat out lying to customers.

### "worst airline experience"
Not Verified |  I have been a long time user of Sun country and usually have a group of 12 or more when we do go since 2009. This last trip to the Bahamas on 2/15 and back from the Bahamas on 2/22 was the worst airline experience I have ever had! We were late leaving MSP by 1 hour because you lost your log book and YOU didn't have the food stocked on the plane. There was no entertainment. Wish we would have known that before hand. Then we lost another hour because when we got to the Bahamas they didn't have a gate for us since we were an hour late! I paid for a limo for our group and had to pay an extra $100 for him to sit there and wait. Then on our way back you were delayed out of NAS. We were to arrive at MSP 3:45 - we didn't arrive until 4:45 and our luggage didn't come out until 5:45. On the flight back we finally had entertainment but no headphones were offered.

### "Customer service is poor"
Ft Myers to Minneapolis. Do not fly this operation unless you are in a pinch or financially strapped. They are by far the worst! I wouldn’t even call them an airline. It’s a charter operation. Customer service is poor, they are habitually late, they nickel and dime you for everything. There is a reason that after almost 40 years in business they only have 25 airplanes and 350 pilots. I will hopefully never have to fly Sun Country again.

### "never fly Sun Country ever again"
Dallas Ft Worth to Minneapolis. Decided to fly Sun Country despite being three hours away from the nearest airport because the rate was so much less expensive. We were supposed to depart at 7:30 PM on February 9th. Throughout the day I received delay notifications via email, the final one stating the flight would leave at 11:30. Around 7 PM we were notified the flight was being canceled and rescheduled for the next morning at 10:30 AM. Food vouchers were offered. The next morning the 10:30 AM flight was again delayed with no explanation or updated time. Given I was going to miss my 1 PM meeting in Minneapolis I canceled my ticket and drove the three hours home. I wasted a lot of time, gas, and expenses for nothing. I will never fly Sun Country ever again. The Sun Country employees in Dallas did not make the situation any better. There was little to no communication and they seemed to be entertained by our frustrations. One employee said to another she was very happy to get the extra overtime pay.

### "I then decided not to embark"
I went to gate h1 at Minneapolis airport to take a flight to Orlando! At the time of boarding I was approached by a Sun Country employee, saying that my carry-on luggage could not board unless I paid an extra fee. They called the manager, who after checking my check-in ticket and that my hand luggage was included, it prevented my boarding and was still making fun of the situation, a moment that I then decided not to embark and look for a way to report the disrespect and lack of consideration of this which is the worst company area I already met!

### "Semi par customer service"
Mazatlan to Minneapolis. Never would I use this airline again. Our plaen left late from Mexico even though it was there in plenty of time. We arrived late at MSP which made us miss our connecting flight to Wausau which made us rent a car. We lost money for our connecting flight and had to pay to rent a car on top of that! Yes the flights may be cheaper but there is a reason for that. Semi par customer service, flight attendants were not the friendliest.

### "Sun Country was pretty much flawless"
St. Louis, MO to Tampa, FL. First, when flying a budget airline, you have to understand that’s exactly what you’re paying for. That being said, my experience with Sun Country was pretty much flawless. Check in was quick and easy, flight crew was friendly, food was just like any other “high end” airline flying economy, and the price was a fraction of the price as some of the bigger names. In all honesty, I did not see any difference between this flight and any flight I’ve taken with Southwest or American. You do pay for baggage, but the flight still ends up much cheaper overall. I even paid for an exit row with extra leg space and still paid about $200 less than any other airline. Flights left and arrived exactly on time and I would definitely recommend Sun Country to anyone and gladly fly with them again!

### "Not worth all the hassle"
This is the worst airline I have ever flown with. I missed my first flight and bought another ticket the same exact day because I didn’t want to miss so many days on my trip and the next “stand by trip” was in 2 days and it was not a guaranteed flight! I am now currently sitting at the airport in another state with no one from Sun Country to give me my bags. They are hard to locate and access and have the worst support team. I came to the airport yesterday and today, wasted on parking just to find no one here. I’m on my “vacation” and have no luggage and have been wearing the same clothes for 2 days! And now I “maybe” have my luggage for tomorrow so that will be 3 days with nothing on my trip. Every other airline is here and laughs at my face when I say I asked for with Sun Country because everyone knows how bad the service is. I bought my tickets 2 times to end up in some state with nothing on me. Never again will I fly with this company. I have never had such a stressful and struggled so much on a “vacation.” They guaranteed me my bag was here but if there is no one from Sun Country I will not get my bag till they feel like coming into work. Not worth all the hassle just go to another airline. The flight feels cheap and the planes are super crowded as well!! Not worth what you pay for in any way. You can barely walk through the isles and the “food” is the worst, no one ever orders anything. I have never been so I unpleased with a company this is ridiculous! Just go to any other airline please!

### "no value with this farce of an airline"
This is a clueless airline, you will get zero communication that is correct. You will be delayed going and coming back, you will wait over 45 minutes for your bags at St Louis, and they will send you to incorrect area to pick up oversize bags, and they have no relationship with the St Louis airport which means you will get no information or cooperation. Because they have no status in St Louis, you will be the last plane de-iced which is why they left us on the tarmac for over 1.5 hours before taking off. Those flight specials aren't even close to special after the add-ons hit you. Absolutely no value with this farce of an airline.

### "never fly this airline again"
Minneapolis to Las Vegas. I understand its a cheap airline, but seriously everything that could go wrong did go wrong! Outrageous baggage prices, rude customer service, delayed flights both coming and going, and not just an hour delay, but a 7 hour delay going and a 4 hour delay coming back. Ridiculous! No explanation or apology, we just had to sit and wait while they flew a different plane in for us from Minneapolis which was 5 hours away! Then when we arrived in Madison, Wisconsin 5 hours late, at 4am it took 45 minutes for us to get out bags. I will never fly this airline again and if you were smart you wont either.

### "not even a tiny bag of pretzels"
Liberia to Minneapolis. Flew with Sun Country over the holidays to Costa Rica. Started off the trip with there system crashing and waiting over two hours in line to check in. Flight attendants were rude and unenjoyable to me. I felt uncomfortable asking them for assistance or service due to short responses. I understand SunCountry is a budget airline but for a 5 and a half hour flight they only had two rounds of beverage service not even a tiny bag of pretzels as a snack. The cherry on top was after arriving back to Minneapolis I was in the global entry line as was the flight attendants and an older couple. The older couple was waiting to be called and were fumbling with their paper and was called which they didn’t see. Instead of telling the older couple they were up the flight attendant completely walked around them to the customs agent rudely. So much for hometown airline kindness from the staff.

### "Worst flying experience"
Not Verified |  Seattle to Minneapolis. Worst flying experience in my life. Rude flight attendants that hit me in the shoulder no less than 15 times. Hard enough to knock me into the person sitting in the middle seat. No gates for boarding or getting off the plane. Had to pack onto a shuttle bus and stand to get a ride from the terminal out to the plane on the tarmac. Paid $40 extra for priority boarding but everyone else was packed on the same shuttle. There’s a waisted $40. Another passenger started yelling profanities at another passenger. Another passenger sitting behind us was displaying his karaoke skills at midnight. Then his earbuds disconnected and his music was on loud for all passengers to hear. No flight attendants around. We had to tell him to turn it down. Seats were tiny, hard and no head rest.

### "Do not fly this airline"
Not Verified |  Our flight from Dallas Fort-Worth to Las Vegas was delayed by an hour and fifteen minutes. We boarded the plane on time, but the rude agent was hustling the passengers along like a herd of cattle and was very rude. My companion and I were told we would be seated in emergency exit seats and asked if that was okay. Both my companion and I responded yes, but the agent looked at my friend of Mexican descent (and speaks very good English) and had the audacity to look at him and say, “do you even speak English?” He had clearly responded to this woman when I did and accepting the responsibility of sitting at an exit seat. It was a one word response and she couldn’t understand him? The fact is, it was she that was difficult to understand because she speaking so fast and not enunciating. On top of that, we enter the very cramped plane with no leg room only to sit on the tarmac for another hour and a half! Also, this airline is not at all well staffed. It was so weird seeing a ticket agent (or whatever she was) the directing the plane out to the runway. Now, we are awaiting our return flight to DFW and the plane is again delayed by approximately an hour and a half. Do not fly this airline! If this were the only airline flying, I would choose the drive to my destination than take this airline. Yes, I’m completely serious.

### "Horrible horrible service"
Not Verified |  Minneapolis to New Orleans. This is the worst airline I have ever used and would not recommend it to anyone. Our flight was delayed two hours on the way to our destination and two hours on the way home without an explanation. My son came in tonight from Colorado and his flight was delayed three hours. Again without an explanation. Very expensive to check a bag. Flight crew was not friendly. Horrible horrible service. Do not fly with Sun Country Airlines.

### "attendants were bossy rude"
Not Verified | San Francisco to Minneapolis. Flight attendants were bossy rude. Made a comment to another passenger and flight attendant overheard our conversation and she quickly spouted off in a snotty tone “Just doing my job”. Also hot warm beverages on the flight! Have never known an airline to not have coffee. For being over staffed with flight attendants, you would think coffee could have been available and staff wouldn’t be so snippy or overworked. Flight 396. It appears that Sun Country service has declined and we have been loyal to this airline for years. For future travels, we’ll be flying a different airline and we’ll recommend to others to do the same.

### "Worst airline we have flown"
Worst airline we have flown. Baggage fees charged were higher than what is posted online, usb charger and in flight WiFi did not work, flight was delayed over an hour and horrible service from flight attendants. Will not use Sun Country Airlines again and do Not recommend it. I sent a detailed message about the multiple problems we experienced on our first flight with SC. They offered us a $10 voucher on a future flight- insulting to say the least.

### "forced to pay $40 each"
Not Verified |  Portland to San Diego. The staff at airport was very rude. Both of my friend and I carried a backpack which we always use when traveling. But we were forced to pay $40 each. This is a ridiculous because the bag packs are always used and never be charged by any other airline! I will never fly this airline again, the flight was delayed again and again.

### "pay $80 for our backpacks"
Portland to San Diego. My boyfriend and I checked in a suitcase so we only each had a backpack as carry on luggage. We have fly to many destinations with these backpacks and never had a problem. But the staff at Portland airport forced us to pay $80 for our backpacks. Otherwise they blocked us from entering the gate. This was a total rip off. It was my first time flying Sun Country and I will never fly it again!

### "I couldn’t check in"
Not Verified |  I went to check in online and the continue button wouldn’t work. I tried downloading their app and got a “this isn’t available in your country” message. Then, I went to the airport hours ahead of my 2.5 hours delayed flight. Because I couldn’t check in, I had no boarding pass and couldn’t get through security. I called sun country, and the website I booked with, and the airport operator - no one could do the simple act of sending me or printing me a boarding pass. And Sun Country at the counter? Nowhere in sight! I rebooted and now they’re saying I’m a “standby” - even though I rebooked with them over the phone some hours ago!

### "found no one at the desk"
Nashville to Minneapolis St-Paul. We arrived at the airport for our flight. Went to go check our luggage and found no one at the desk, no signage telling us where someone might be or how to get ahold of anyone. We waited for about 20 minutes. During that time, there were multiple employees that walked into and out of the sun country office behind the desk. Seeing us along with a few others waiting in line to be acknowledged. Not one word was said to us, come to find out from another person flying on our flight that they don’t open the gate until a certain time before the flight. This is ridiculous. One of the employees could of at least told us this information so we didn’t waste time standing there and being ignored. Worst experience with customer service I have seen.

### Sun Country Airlines customer review
Austin to Gulf Port via Ft Myers. I have never heard of paying for a bag on each leg of a one way flight. This should be disclosed when you purchase the ticket. I will never fly on this airline again.

### "refused to exchange my ticket"
This airline refused to exchange my ticket home and forced me to purchase a new ticket at $600 to fly home to see my mother before she died last week! And then they sold my seat for my original flight also to another person so they got double the money on that seat. Talk about a company that is heartless and just in it for the money. And their counters are not covered by agents most of the day. I waited at the Orlando airport for 6 hours to talk to an agent to get on their next flight. And after telling her it should only be an exchange fee per 3 phone calls to their customer service line, their counter agent actually said to me “well that’s not my problem” and said I had to purchase a new ticket at $600 or not be on the flight! At one point she actually told me to step aside so she could help the next customer. Their website also states it should be it just an exchange fee. When I showed the website to the ticket agent she said it doesn’t matter we can charge whatever we want. The most Horrible experience with customer service I have ever had with an airline. So hugely disappointed with this airline.

### "the most disorganized airline"
Minneapolis to Portland. Sun County is by far the most disorganized airline. I went on my trip to Minneapolis, only to have my bag lost through sun country. We waited 3 hours at the Airport and it miraculously showed up ...  now on the flight home, I checked 2 bags, the cheaper one with way less valuables made it, where as my other suitcase filled full of expensive and sentimental items never made it. They have no baggage handlers or customer service agents, no one to talk to to resolve the issue. I will never spend my money on this airline again.

### "Very unhappy flyer"
Not Verified | Have always had very good luck with Sun Country Airlines. Not this time! Flying out from Savannah GA to Minneapolis Mn. Flight 208 leaving at 10:10 am. Delayed till 2:00 pm. Then 9:00 pm. All this because if a tyre? Will consider other airlines now before using Sun Country. Very unhappy flyer!

### "Most horrible service"
Las Vegas to Portland. Most horrible service I’ve gotten from an air flight. I accidentally booked from the wrong destination. I called from the airport because there was no one at the counter and the lady on the phone said well there’s nothing we can do because your missing your flight. Obviously because I’m in a different state. Would give me a voucher, credit or offer to help

### "look forward to our next flight"
Not Verified |  Macon to Gulfport. Excellent flight, excellent pilots and excellent stewardess. We were an hour late departing but safety comes first. We really enjoyed the flight in both directions and would recommend the airline to others easily. Thank you Sun Country, we look forward to our next flight with you!

### "so nice and didn't have to be"
Minneapolis to San Diego. Was at the gate 2 hrs early. While I was killing time walking around there was this nice gentleman and I asked him if he could change my seat assignment? At first he said I had to wait for the flight attendants so I sat down and waited. He then, after doing a few things said come over here. I walked over and he said ok I can do it quickly for you! He was so nice and didn't have to be.

### "still won't refund ticket fares"
I find this crazy. My wife and I were planning on taking a vacation when her father passed away a few days before. As I'm sure anyone would understand you deal with the loss above anything else. That being said we still called Sun Country to inform them of our loss and provide a death certificate as soon as possible. Sun Country's response was it was a $90 change fee with another $100 fee for something else (couldn't remember as I was a bit agitated) and had I called sooner they could've provided a credit against my account. The tickets were $200 total. It's unfortuante the compassion most airlines have (we were flying United out and they refunded the tickets no question) is lost on my hometown airline. Either way we felt people should know that Sun Country in the most extreme circumstances still won't refund ticket fares.

### "see it falling apart"
Not Verified | Minneapolis to Las Vegas. We've flown on this airline frequently the last 20 years and over the last year see it falling apart both in management/employee and plane maintenance. Employees seem unhappy and some we talked to agree things are not right. My wife's plane taking off out of Savannah, Ga. last Nov had taken off and lifted off when it abruptly set back down barely stopping at end of the strip. The plane sat waiting for a part for 6 hours with little communication to passengers. She was very scared when they did take off. This past spring twice in two week period we had a guest who tried flying out of Orlando and had flights canceled but got flights out the next day. On this weeks flight Sept 23rd from Minneapolis to Vegas the one flight attendant we saw made it down the aisle one-time serving liquids, but no snacks at all or smile. Charging for bags, canceled flights, no answer at customer service for hours, flights now scheduled from many smaller cities at $39 is not going to gain a profit or make their coordination of flights and service better. They are failing since the Davis family sold to this hedge fund and a new CEO that thinks backwards. Soon we will read of once a great SunCountry going bankrupt. No longer our "Home town airline".

### "make you pay for overhead bag"
Providence to San Francisco via Minneapolis. They make you pay for overhead bag which is the same price as if you were going to check it. They do offer complementary drinks but make you pay anywhere from $4-$8 for snacks. Seriously $4 for a regular size bag of M’ms.... ripoff. They do offer inflight entertainment, however the signal is horrible and was constantly disconnecting. The movie would have long pauses making it difficult to enjoy the movie. Also the selection appeared to have a lot of outdated movies and not a big selection of tv choices. I do not think I would fly with them again.

### "Too many hidden costs"
Not Verified |  Minneapolis to Phoenix. Too many hidden costs. Everyone from ticket counter to crew was rude. I was charged 35 bucks for a carry on bag. Carry on! Who does that? I had to pay for any food. No peanuts or free pretzels.

### "The flight was freezing"
Las Vegas to Minneapolis. Red-eye flight, we paid for the SunCountry version of "First Class" or what they refer to as premium seating. Sat in the first row on the plane. The flight was freezing, the flight attendant told me there were no blankets available but that it should warm up as we get moving. It got colder throughout the flight and many people kept saying how cold it was with zero accomodation made. Bright lights on the entire flight from where the flight attendants sat especially if you are sitting first row. Most immature flight attendants I have experienced, laughing loudly and talking the entire flight, and kept yawning so loud the entire flight could hear. Again this is a red-eye have some courtesy for those trying to get some sleep. No beverage/snack service offered. The worst flight ever. Last resort booking due to family emergency or I gladly would pay for to go Delta.

### "sad that Sun Country is leaving TF Green"
T F Green to Vegas. I am sad that Sun Country airlines as of Oct 2019 is leaving TF Green. I really like this airline, the seats are comfy, its clean, and the best feature is they have straight through flights.

### "I’ll never fly with them again"
Anchorage to Las Vegas. I’m aware these tickets are cheaper so I don’t know why I expected any decency. But it was literally the worst experience of my life. I’m a pretty mellow person. Not a lot gets to me. But this was definitely something else. The seats wouldn’t go back. I asked if they had blankets or if they could turn off the air. And they said no. It was an overnight flight. Everyone was freezing. Literally me and my sister were shivering. Didn’t sleep on second of the entire flight because we were so cold. It was a round trip. On our way there they never charged us for our carry on bag so I figured it was included and then on our way back they charged us and I don’t even know if I believe them or if they just hate us. Someone messed up. Because on our way over they didn’t charge us and on the way back they did. I didn’t even have the money for it. Panicked. Didn’t know what to do. Seriously most stressful flight experience ever. I’ll never fly with them again.

### "never use Sun Country again"
Portland to Minneapolis. What a joke. Thought I would save some money by choosing a smaller airline. Never again. By the time we retrieve our luggage, time spent and gas will make it more expensive than if we would have flown Delta. Sun Country lost my luggage on by return trip. I live 1.5 hours from Portland and the airlines is making me come back to get my bag. What a joke. Other airlines either ship it or deliver it. I will never use Sun Country again. Furthermore, I waited on hold for over an hour and no one ever came on the line, good thing because by then I was loaded for a good argument. Take my advice, don't do it! They also charge more for checking a bag than any other airline.

### "ruined a very expensive trip"
Dallas Ft Worth to Cancun. I checked in at D terminal in DFW Airport. It was 630AM and both counter clerks were out of their minds. We are a family of 4. The clerk didn’t tag my bag and I let her know she didn’t tag my bag because she had the tag still in her hand. She actually said to my face she tagged it. I see my bag going behind the curtain with no tag! She then proceeds to call someone on her cell and tell them to grab the grey luggage and whispering like I couldn’t here her. I felt like I was being scammed  and they have some type of ring going. Needless to say 5 days later my bag never made. Low and behold the day we come back it happens to be in the supervisors office. He the proceeds to tell me he never opened my bag and only identified it by a broken handle. He then tells my husband only TSA opened it. The TSA notification was in the suitcase so how would he know. They ruined a very expensive trip with my family. 5 days with none of my belongings and they only have me a $50 per day allowance. We never fly cheap and took a chance. Cheap isn’t always better and we’ve learned our lesson. We have filed a report with the airport police department and will make so much noise they wish they hadn’t taken anything.

### "Worst customer service ever"
Minneapolis to Portland. I can't actually review the flight because I never flew the flight. My flight got cancelled 2 hours prior to departure and we waited for answers 8 hours at the airport. Worst customer service ever, never fly Sun Country.They finally checked us into a hotel at 2.30 am the following day. Horrific service.

### "no representative and a lost bag"
Minneapolis to Chicago. I’m stranded Chicago O'Hare at 4pm, with no representative and a lost bag. Been on hold for an hour with customer support. By far the worst flight experience ever and now with loss of personal belongings to boot. I hope this company fails.

### "Absolutely terrible experience"
Seattle to Minneapolis. Absolutely terrible experience all around (flight staff were great actually). It's been awhile since I have flown and I remember Sun Country actually caring about their customers. Their hidden fees with baggage and their complete lack of transparency with delays prompted me to write my first airline review ever. They will have plenty of first time fliers until they realize how horrendous of an experience it is flying with them.

### "Worst experience I’ve had"
San Francisco to Orlando via Minneapolis. First thing the airline was delayed they didn’t even have the courtesy to let us know that the airline or delayed or something. Connecting via Minneapolis I had to run because my flight was leaving in 5min when I arrived. Made it to Orlando in time but I didn’t get my luggage. I asked everywhere but no one seem to know. I went to their counter upstairs but no one was there, terrible experience I had , i paged then using the passenger phones, but no one came down to assist me. I waited almost 2hrs just to get my luggage, even now I’m still standing here no one is here to assist. Please don’t ever waste your money flying with this airline. Worst experience I’ve had when traveling

### "was great to fly with"
Portland to St Louis. I'm happy I see for myself about things and not always go by reviews. Sun Country was great to fly with to and from my destination. Staff was friendly and provided good service both directions. Sun Country was very accommodating with my luggage that should have been checked. Helping me put it overhead because it was too heavy. Sorry Sun Country won't do that again. I was able to move seat because the plan wasn't full and I really enjoyed have my own row.

### "First and last time with this airline"
Portland to San Francisco. First and last time flying with this airline. They charge $30 for hand luggage, $7 to assign a seat. Boarding was chaotic, the plane had technical problems, 1 hour waiting inside the cabin. During the trip, the air conditioner was set to the lowest temperature possible, everybody was freezing. Asked for a coffee and got and got a cup with hot water and an a package with generic instant coffee!

### "Terrible. Egregious"
Portland to Minneapolis. Terrible. Egregious. Horrendous. From scheduling to customer policy. We had a flight scheduled from 7:25 and got delayed to at least 11 AM. It was for a job interview and now the employer is backing away. Sun Country literally did not care and offered me a refund for their late flight - that’s it. Do not fly pay the extra money.

### "customer service is terrible"
Not Verified |  Portland to Minneapolis. Terrible airline. Flight got delayed 4 times. You know that happens. But the problem is the customer service is terrible! The communication was extremely poor letting us all know the delay and what to do. They moved us to 4 different gates. 4 hour delay. Oh and the plane is awful too, terrible seats.

### "absolutely positive experience"
I was very nervous to fly Sun Country after all the terrible reviews but both ways I had an absolutely positive experience. Very nice staff, and although you have to pay extra for everything it still ends up being cheaper than the others. Take offs and landings were right on time, and everything flowed smooth... I would without a doubt use them again. Way better than Southwest!

### "doesn’t care about their customers"
Not Verified |  Chicago to Portland via Minneapolis. Sun Country doesn’t care about their customers. Their customer service line wait time is always over 90 minutes (I have called 12 times, and have been told to either call a different line, have been disconnected, or have been told that I’ll receive e-mail correspondence — which I have yet to receive). Their service and airport agents have no idea what’s going on, I receive inconsistent information from ever person I speak with. I am waiting on reimbursement from the airline and have been pushed around by agents, made to feel inferior by customer service agents, and told that my experience doesn’t matter to them. My flight was delayed and then cancelled, I have not received compensation, compensation which I was told very clearly I would receive in the form of travel reimbursement and per diem. Sun Country is the worst airline I have ever had the displeasure of working with.

### "attendants were professional yet friendly"
Not Verified |  Portland to Nashville. My guess is that someone read the reviews here and elsewhere and decided to do something about it. I travel more than 100,000 a year and had to fly to Nashville. Sun Country had the only direct flight and at half the cost of other airlines. I was prepared for the worst but figured it's only 4 hours so I will survive. I did splurge the $30 for the exit seats. Best $30 I ever spent. To begin with, check-in was blazing fast, I only had a back-pack. Everyone was smiling and courteous at the counter and the gate. The plane was clean, the flight attendants were professional yet friendly. Take off and landing smoothly as a baby's bottom. Since I'm not the only one to give them high marks in the last few reviews I can only deduct that someone read the reviews and acted on them. Good for them. That's how you show you care about your business.

### "Worst experience ever!"
Worst experience ever! It was first time flying this airline and it would be my last. First off our luggage left without us, due to a 2 mins lateness but the flight ended up leaving later than scheduled but we were still not let in. We got to Austin through another airline by some few minutes after 10 pm. There was a not a single agent to tell us anything about our luggages. Its been 24 hours and yet no agent is available to tell us where our luggage are. Keys to our apartment and car is in the bag, you call and no one hardly picks up.this is the worst airline they will put you through a psychological rollercoaster. Run away and i mean it, extreme bad services.

### "you get what you pay for"
San Antonio to Portland. This is my first (and last) trip with Sun Country. For the first flight, we were boarded on time, but sat on the runway area for 54 mins while they tried to figure out why the communications lines weren’t operating. The plane headed up to 85+ degrees while we sat and waited - melting in the hot south Texas July heat. 4 days later on the returning flight, we all board 20 mins late and sat on the runway yet again for 48 mins. This time at PDX the plane interior only heated up to around 78/80 degrees while we waited for the plane's crew to announce that the AC unit wasn’t functioning properly and we were directed to de-plane. We ended up waiting 2 additional hours in the airport for another Sun Country plane to land, so we could board it. Are people being boarded before these things are checked? Long story short - you get what you pay for. Pay the additional $100 bucks and fly with a competent airline - you know Delta, American, Southwest, United, seriously any other airline that has a reputation to be upheld.

### "denied a second beverage"
Portland to St Louis. The flight attendants were very rude and you could tell they did not like their job. I was denied a second beverage on a 4 hour flight. Very disappointed to spend 4 hours feeling this way for the amount of money we spent.

### "fake low fare deal"
❎ Not Verified | I’ve flown Sun Country a handful of times from San Francisco to Minneapolis. The aircraft is decent and has phone chargers and I’ve never had a delay. I don’t eat aeroplane garbage food so I can’t comment on that in particular. The problem with Sun Country is they charge you $30 for any carry on and when you check-in you have to pay an additional $10 for your seat. You think you’re getting a good deal on your airfare but when you check in, they collect a minimum of $40 additional. When you purchase your ticket, it does not include your seat. This is absurd. It’s worth it to pick a full fare airline and not be tricked by some fake low fare deal on Sun Country

### "nightmarish experiences"
❎ Not Verified | Minneapolis to Seattle. I was surprised when checking in for my last Sun Country flight that a single carry-on now costs me $40. I'll be factoring that in when I choose future flights, and I'll be more likely to opt for Delta or Alaska. I wish I could kick Sun Country, but the best I can do is post this review and choose differently next time. Reading some of the other Sun Country reviews, I am so sorry to other passengers who have had really nightmarish experiences with Sun Country! My complaint is very minor in comparison. Better yet, we could all ride Amtrak - better for the environment - but their pricing and customer service record aren't really stellar, either.

### "Just don't fly this airline"
Sun Country Airlines may cancel your flight and not notify you. I was set to fly from Las Vegas to Minneapolis and after checking in for my flight online and confirming the flight status in the morning as "on time" I went to the airport only to be told the flight was canceled As a bonus, Sun Country offers you nothing in the way of assistance. No attempt to rebook you on another airline, no assistance with hotel voucher, meals, transportation or any other kind of assistance. They will provide you with a "Customer Care" number, but you will recieve a recording that tells you nobody can take your call. Eventually, they will just close the check-in gate and not talk to you or the other 200 passengers they strand at the airport. Never again. Just don't fly this airline. They were once a great airline, but the new corporate owners don't care about the consumers. They are notorious for canceled and delayed flights, and no customer service. Do yourself a favor and do not fly Sun Country.

### "flight was extremely uncomfortable"
Not Verified |  Flight 261 from Minneapolis to Chicago O'Hare, June 29. Flight delayed one hour, and included a gate change it happens. When we boarded, the plane had been sitting at the gate for close to an hour in the sun (temperature was 88 degrees in Minneapolis). Upon boarding, the cabin was very hot. The captain informed us that after they got the engines running and up in the air, the AC would come on and cool off the cabin. He was either wrong or lying because it never came on. What little air flow could be coaxed from the overhead nozzles was the same temperature as the cabin. The flight was extremely uncomfortable. When we landed it took 10 minutes to taxi to the gate. When we arrived, the gate ramp was not in place and it took 7 more minutes to get it in place. The temperature in Chicago was 90 degrees and gate ramp that sits outside in the sun all day was cooler than the plane when we got off.

### "Never fly Sun Country Airlines"
Newark to Minneapolis. Neither my partner nor myself have ever experience the level of incompetence and sheer unprofessionalism from an airline as we did this Saturday (6/29) until our first and only encounter with Sun Country Airlines. The short of it is that our flight to Minnesota was cancelled without ever informing us even now 48hrs after the scheduled flight. We were booked for an 11:45am flight out of Newark, NJ non-stop to Minneapolis, MN, flight SY 234. We received an email at 5am saying our flight had been delayed to 2:45pm, no biggie. At 8am another email arrived with an update that the delay was now until 3:10pm, no prob. Around 8:45am (AFTER the two delay emails) another airline’s plane made an emergency landing at Newark Airport causing complete closure for about 3hrs. Understandably all the airlines spent the rest of the day scrambling to accommodate their passengers, all but Sun Country Airlines. We had left our apt around 8:45am before opening the emails regarding the delays but decided we might as well continue over to the airport just in case things change further. We arrived around 11am and noticed immediately that the departure board had been updated and now our flight had been delayed until 4:46pm although we hadn’t received any email notification. Arriving at the ticket counter we discovered the Sun Country counter was closed and no employees were to be found. Several families were stranded with us and all stated without discrepancy that we had just missed two Sun Country employees being instructed by their supervisor to close their ticket counter and leave! No explanation to their customers, no assistance, and no update that the flights had been cancelled! One of the other customers informed us of the cancellation and gave us a Sun Country customer service number, apparently a parting gift from the Sun Country ticket counter employees. He warned us that he’d been on the phone for more than 45min thus far without getting through to anyone. My partner immediately placed the call. Upon noting how many people around us were discussing booking on another flight we scrambled our financial resources and bought the cheapest available tickets on another carrier that would get us to our destination, spending $500 more than the previous tickets had been. Finally, over 2hrs later, my partner was able to reach someone representing Sun Country customer service on the phone. This rep voiced shock and surprise when he explained to her that the Sun Country supervisor had pulled his ticket counter employees without any explanation to their customers, that we had not received any notice of cancellation (she confirmed the cancellation), and that we’d been on hold for over 2hrs still at the airport. She refused to send us any emailed confirmation of the cancelation nor the promised full refund. Fast forward two days later, we still have not received any notification from Sun Country of the cancellation, there’s no listing of the flight cancellation online, no notification of a refund, and of course no actual refund. We’ve also found online that this was not an isolated incident! On the same day this occurred (6/29/19), customers across the country (Boston, Las Vegas, DC) received the same treatment - canceled flights, no communication, no Sun Country staff at the airport, and 2+ hour phone waits on hold for customer service. Never fly Sun Country Airlines! They should not be allowed to conduct business!

### "no guarantee of leaving today"
Not Verified |  Boston to San Diego via Minneapolis. Never again. We are delayed in Minneapolis with no guarantee of leaving today. Delayed twice and the website seems to be down for Sun country too. save yourself the trouble and book any other airline.

### "worst customer service"
Portland to Las Vegas. Some of the worst customer service I've encountered. I've never had an airline I couldn't get through to on the phone until now. No wonder my flight was cheap. I tried reaching them by phone for over a week regarding my tickets and every time I called the prompt said we're unable to take your call due to a high volume of calls. Now I'm waiting to board and our flight is already late due to a stewardess being late. This is ridiculous. I won't be flying through them again.

### "never fly this airline again"
Not Verified |  Minneapolis to Chicago. Horrible customer service! We were sent back to MSP due to weather conditions which is understandable. I needed to make a connecting international flight which I allowed several hours between just in case there was a delay. We were to arrive in Chicago at 4:25 pm and my next flight was at 10 pm. Plenty of extra time. I asked if sun country could contact Scandinavian airlines in Chicago to let them know of the very lengthy delay and they as told 1 I could live on the number up just as easily as they could 2. They were only responsible for getting me to Chicago so it’s not their problem. I will never fly this airline again. Very rude and unhelpful and unkind people who work there.

### "I will fly them again"
Not Verified |  Chicago to Minneapolis. We arrived late at the check-in counter 35 minutes prior to arrival and the flight was already closed. We knew that and asked the check-in agent kindly if she can do anything for us. She called the gate and got the Go, but only if we run and make it within 15 minutes to the gate. She said 'Run Guys, I want that you make it and handed us our boarding passes. We made it and the gate agent said 'I'm happy you guys made it' This was very nice, because most other folks wouldn't care if you show up late. Flight was on time and cabin crew friendly as well. Basic transportation with no frills, but the plane was clean and looked quite new. Free Inflight entertainment via Wifi. Not huge, but OK. But again, most importantly it seemed like they care about their customers and gave us a chance to get on our flight, even though it was our fault that we showed up late. I will fly them again and thanks again to the nice SY staff at ORD.

### "worst customer service"
Sun Country Airlines the worst customer service I have ever seen. Trip of a lifetime to Alaska tainted by lost luggage for two days now and the only thing they can tell us is it might be here tomorrow. No guarantees no proof that they even know where it is and NO compensation for lost time at the airport waiting for it or for items that had to be replaced.

### "poor customer experience"
I traveled from Portland to Nashville (and back) on Sun Country airline. The flight there was fine and met my (low) expectations for an inexpensive flight. The seats were small and uncomfortable, but in line with expectations. My flight home is where things took a turn for the worse. Our flight was an hour late to even get to the gate. Once we boarded, we sat on the plane for nearly an hour as well. Sometimes this is out of the airline's control so I tried to give them the benefit of the doubt. Then the flight had no AC. One of the flight attendants apologized and told us once the flight began it would get better. It did not. On top of the extreme heat, the flight attendants did not even offer us water. When I landed in PDX it was after 1 am. When my checked bag finally came through the baggage claim, my bra was hanging out one end of it (embarrassing), but I grabbed my bag (exhausted & sweaty) and headed to my Uber. When I got home, I realized one of the pockets of my bag was now broken and all of the contents were missing. First thing in the morning I called the airline and was told it would be best to bring my bag and ticket to the airport (45 minutes away from my house) and they'd help me there. Great - so I drove to the airport early that afternoon with my empty, broken bag. Once I got there, the woman at the desk was shocked at why I thought it was a good idea to drive out to the airport. I should file a claim online, she said. She also asked why I would not have filed this claim immediately at the airport. I filed my claim online (easy enough) and received a lengthy generic email in return that told me I had to print out a four page form, fill it in, attach receipts for all items, get it signed by a notary (!) and send it back. Are you kidding me? A terrible flight experience is one issue and often out of the control of the crew, but poor customer experience and rude customer representatives are the reason that I will not ever be flying Sun Country airlines again and I urge you to do the same.

### "horrible customer service"
Can't give zero stars but that is my rating. Was scheduled to fly to Minneapolis from Dulles last night on SunCountry Airlines flight 236 at 6pm. I had checked in online the night before to save time. I had one carryon bag which I paid for, as well as my seat assignment I paid for. I had my e-ticket on my phone and did not plan to go to the ticket desk. No gate was listed on my e-ticket. Storms were in the area and I received notification from my flight tracker app on my phone that the flight was delayed until 7:45pm. I decided to go ahead to the airport at approximately 4pm as traffic in our area is awful anyway. Upon arriving at the airport, I checked the departure board for my flight and it indeed showed it was delayed until 7:45pm with no gate assigned. I went ahead through security and proceeded to an information desk just past security to ask what gate Sun Country flies out of. The gentleman informed me Z gate. Upon arriving at Z gate, I found no food and was hungry (it was about 4:45/5pm by this time). Figuring I had time to go find something to eat, I proceeded to go to B gate. As I finished my meal, my flight tracker on my phone notified me that my flight was leaving right then at 6pm. I paid for my meal and proceeded back to Z gate. The departure boards still said 7:45pm departure with no gate listed. I asked around until I found the gate and was told by the Sun Country reps that the flight was indeed gone. They gave me a customer service number to call and said no more flights until Sunday (this was Friday). I proceeded back out to ticketing to find no one at the Sun Country desk to assist. My husband then called the customer service number. He was told they will not refund my fare and will charge me $125 to cancel the return flight. They will only refund my bag and seat fee of $59 by a voucher with the airline. I am now unable to make my trip to see my friend for the weekend. All because I checked in online and they did not update the Departure board at the airport. No fault of my own. I am furious. This is horrible business practice and horrible customer service. I want others to know they should never fly this airline so they won't be taken advantage of. I will never fly Sun Country ever again. Since this airline is new to our area, the people of the DMV should know that Sun Country does not care about its customers.

### "never fly Sun Country again"
I fly budget airlines all the time. I'm very pro-Spirit airlines and pro-Ryanair. I'm in high support of any no-frills budget airline that can get you to where you need to go. That being said, I will never fly Sun Country airlines again, no matter the price. Here was my experience: I get to the airport at 6am for my 8:30am flight. Since it's an international flight, Sun Country makes you check-in in person (not sure why). There were 2 people manning the check-in station for over 1000 people waiting in line. The line wrapped around the entire airport and out the door- this is not an exaggeration. I saw at least 20 people in front of me miss their flight due to the long line. I waited in line for 3 hours, finally checking in at 9:30. I was one of the first people checked in for my 8:30AM flight. The flight was 6 hours delayed, so my 3PM arrival time was actually changed to 9PM. That wasn't even the bad flight. On the way back, the flight was delayed first one hour, then two hours, then eventually 8 hours. It turns out there was a malfunction on the place preventing us from flying. We were in Punta Cana, and the two people manning the check in station spoke only Spanish and wouldn't tell us what happened. Then, after waiting 8 hours, the staff told us to get on a bus. I am a 23 year old woman by myself, getting loaded onto a bus with no explanation in a foreign country not knowing where the bus was headed, with no one who spoke English to ask. I was truly terrified. It was around midnight when we finally checked into the Hotel the staff supplied for us. They told us to come back to the bus at 4AM for our outbound flight. I purchased an international calling plan so I could call my mom in the case of an emergency. My sister paid $500 for the same flight on Southwest (I paid $300), and every day I regret not paying the extra $200 for my peace of mind and hours of my waiting time back.

### "won't recommend or fly them again"
Portland to Phoenix. After buying your ticket, you then have to to buy your seat at varying rates. Only 1 (!) small carry-on allowed, so they increase their profitably immensely when you are surprised to learn your 2nd, small carry-on which is free at every other airline now costs $40 to bring it aboard or $35 if I check it. My ticket and then purchasing my seat: $77, my bag and surprise fee for my 2nd small carry on is $75, essentially doubling the ticket price. Sun Country is charging passengers such as myself twice the original ticket price in accumulated and unexpected tariffs. Everyone knows airlines profit nicely with baggage fees, with Sun Country deliberately limiting carry-on to increase baggage fees and charging for a seat, these are exactly the business practices that Spirit Airlines got nailed for several years ago. Transparency is important and Sun Country has hidden, parasitic pricing where you would never expect it. I won't recommend or fly them again.

### "Flight was great"
Miami to Minneapolis. Flight was great. I’m a simple person and they satisfied me completely. Smooth flight and friendly and funny staff. I would definitely recommend Sun Country if you are not looking for first class seats. We were ahead of schedule and all bags arrived with us. I encourage everyone to try this airline and decide for yourself if you would fly it again. I would.

### "Completely unsatisfied!"
Minneapolis to Tampa. Nothing but problems with Sun Country. Previously 3 weeks ago, our checked bag was destroyed. We had to tape it together to leave the airport. We were told we would be reimbursed for it then received an email saying Sun Country would cover the repairs up to 25.00. What a complete joke! The zippers and fabric were busted. Our bag was not jammed packed either and emailing back and forth with Sun Country has been a nightmare. Now March 25th we flew again and were charged an extra $40.00 for a carry on bag we didn’t even have. If I hadn’t checked my bank account we would of never know because they didn’t have us sign anything but I did sign the receipt for the one checked bag we had. What a scam, now we had to make a complaint again and play their email back and forth game. We will not be flying or purchasing tickets again with Sun Country. Always make sure to check your accounts for unauthorized charges or pay cash. What a pain in the butt. Completely unsatisfied! Don’t make the mistake of flying with them!

### "This ruined our honeymoon"
We had a package with the airline, hotel, and a rental car for our honeymoon in Las Vegas. We were at the DFW airport waiting on our flight that was scheduled at 2:30pm. The board showed our flight was delayed till 5:45pm. Another 3 hours. (While waiting we over heard a woman complaining that their flight to Phoenix got canceled.) When that time got closer we approached the gate to board the plane only to he told our flight was cancelled. The board was never changed to cancelled so this was a big shock to us. They were in process of boarding the flight "Phoenix" when we were asking why our flight was cancelled. So it was obvious they cancelled our flight to let the Phoenix flight go out. We were told we could wait till 3 more days to get us a flight there or vouchers. This ruined our honeymoon. They refused to give us a better offer and refused to make another flight out after taking the Phoenix flight. They said that was the only flight they were making for the day. We had to make many phone calls to find a way to our honeymoon trip.

### "charges for carry on bags"
Only airline I have ever flown that charges for carry on bags, added an additional $80 to my trip. Had a connecting flight from Fort Myers, FL to New Orleans, LA. The layover was in Nashville, TN. Upon landing the pilot informed the passengers that he would be finishing the route to New Orleans and it would be in the same terminal. The pilot stated that passengers would have plenty of time to use the restroom and get food, so my girlfriend and I did just that. After being gone for no more than 15 minuets, the flight left without us and Sun Country was far less than helpful in helping us find a new flight. The original boarding in Fort Myers was late, and despite the pilots claim that passengers during the layover would have time to relieve themselves, this was not the case. Ground service claimed they told passengers exiting the plane to stay in the terminal, but we were some of the first passengers to exit and received no such notice. Our flight was SY 638 on 3/18/19 and will be the last time either of us ever fly Sun Country.

### "A very enjoyable experience"
Not Verified |  
First experience with Sun Country Airlines. Travelled to Tampa and returned to Nashville 2 weeks later. Utilized wheelchair assistance both trips from counter to gate and to baggage claim. Great experience for two senior adults. Able to carryon my CPAP machine free with no difficulty. Total ticket cost including two checked bags both trips much less cost than other carriers. Limited flight trips but so what. A very enjoyable experience for both of us. They are not perfect but who is?

### "you get what you pay for"
Tampa to Minneapolis. No announcements for delayed flights. They do not have an app or wifi on the flight. I am on the plane right now and the flight attendant is complaining to all the passengers that she does not get paid unless in the air and our flight was supposed to depart at noon yet here we are 1.00 and still waiting for the door to close. I would blame it on the airport/ground crew but it was the exact same fiasco on Monday when I flew out. Two hours late appears to be their standard business model. I will never fly this airline again. No wonder their fare is cheap - you get what you pay for.

### "seats were uncomfortable"
Minneapolis to Mazatlan. The seats were uncomfortable and small. The plane was delayed both ways. On the way back we were delayed about an hour and then had to wait for paperwork because we had to take a different route and it was faster then any other time. So why wouldn’t we take that route every other time. There was horrible turbulence on the way there and one of the flight attendants yelled at a person who was already up and on their way to bathroom before the seatbelt light was on. Delta flight that was suppose to leave an hour or so after us ended up leaving before us which resulted in waiting longer. The flight attendants on the way home were awesome.

### "so grateful for Sun Country"
Not Verified |  Orlando to Minneapolis. Sun Country made a terrible day so much better! We had a cancelled flight and the airline we went through was terrible about it. We spent hours trying to figure out what to do. We tried to get tickets online and everything was a mess. We called Sun Country customer service because we saw they had a flight leaving from Orlando in the morning. Even though it was 80 miles away it was our only option. The lady we talked to was so helpful and kind. She calmed us and made everything better. She even bumped us to first class. We had a ton of extra expenses, but we were so grateful for Sun Country. Our flight was uneventful which was exactly what we wanted. Thank you so much!

### "I didn't have any issues"
Orlando to Nashville. Not sure what happened with others' experience with this airline or if my experience is a fluke, but I didn't have any issues with my flight with Sun Country at all. I would have liked to have one free checked bag but since it wasn't available, I did pay for one bag and also upgraded my seats to premium so I could have a larger seat and only sit 2 to a row at the front of the airplane, what the seats are bigger. I paid extra for those items because I chose to and even doing so, my flight on Sun Country was about 1/2 of what 2 other top named airlines wanted to charge me for the same flight. I was allowed to bring my CPAP machine online as an additional carry on item without any hassle or questioning whatsoever. (Yes, I realize the ADA states that they must allow you to bring them on the plane, but I just wanted to reinforce how easy it was to do so). The premium economy seats receive a free beverage and they also gave us a wafer cookie from Denmark ad well. Being as this was only a 2 hour flight, I really want expecting much else. The initial ticketing agent, the gate agent and all the flight attendants were very friendly and courteous and very professional. This is an economy airline so if you want top of the line service then you need to look elsewhere and pay more for it. If you want to get from point A to point B for an affordable price and professional service, I would recommend them.

### "charges for everything"
Not Verified | Minneapolis to Cancun. They should change the name to bum country. What another ultra low cost carrier that charges for everything. The only thing you can do for free is breathe. It probably won't be long and they'll charge for that too. Do yourself a favor and get a seat on an airline that has a carry on and seat choice built in. You won't feel so screwed.

### "Absolutely the worst service"
I was putting my 2 underage children on the plane on 1/7/19 and we arrived over 2 hours prior to a 6:20 flight. Other flights were being pulled out of line (MANY BEHIND US) and were allowed to go to the front as their flights left first. CanCun, Puerto Vallarta, and Orlando to name some. Ft Myers was called and told if we were in the front two lanes to stay) which we were, but once again people who came in after us got put into a separate line and made it through faster. We had to wait through TSA even though Tampa was pushed ahead there (flight left 20 minutes after ours) By the time we made it through TSA final boarding had been called, we had to run and my kids were whisked onto the plane before I could say Goodbye. I talked to the Suntrust manager and he smirked at me and said ”they made the plane I don’t know what your problem is”. Absolutely the worst service I've ever had.

### "grossly customer-unfriendly"
Minneapolis to Las Vegas. What a pity that the new Sun Country management has turned a once great airline, one that was admired and preferred by its customers, into the grossly customer-unfriendly, uncaring and manipulative organization that it is today. It is not really a surprise, although it is terribly disappointing, that Sun Country is turning out to be another Allegiant - or worse - and soon to be worse than Spirit. It takes a lot of bad decisions and questionable practices to make that happen. Sun Country used to differentiate itself in the market - sensible pricing and customer-friendly - a great middle of the road winning strategy when implemented properly. Unfortunately, the customer-friendly aspect at Sun Country is history. They truly do not care about their customers. They do care about their customers' money - and they implement every trick in the book to extract more of it from them. And, it keeps getting worse. Part of Sun Country's problem is that they no longer have any leadership positions. They are followers of the industry it total and of the industry's most hated companies. When I buy an airline ticket, I expect to be provided a seat. Paying twice for seats has become an unsavory practice of some carriers, Sun Country included. But Sun Country goes even further. They intentionally punish their customers who refuse to pay extra for their seat. Now, you cannot check in online if you refuse to pay extra to choose a seat. Spirit does the same thing (Shame!) but at least they let you check in at a kiosk at the airport. On our 1/1/2019 Sun Country flight, they provided no kiosk at the airport, so we had to stand in line (30 minutes) to check in - even though we had no luggage. That punishment is obviously so people will pay the seat extortion in the future. Today I had the misfortune of making a mistake in the booking of a Sun Country ticket for my grandaughter. Easy to correct on customer- friendly airlines. But, Sun Country had no way to cancel the ticket online. You had to call Reservations. I did, and was told the wait might be up to 60 minutes. Actually, the wait was a little over one hour. I had to rebook her flight, but I gladly paid more on another carrier so I could avoid further abuse from Sun Country. I was not abused as badly as all those people who were stranded when Sun Country cancelled scores of flights - and then said they would refund the fares, but the people "were on their own". That kind of arrogance and contempt for customers is what will eventually bring Sun Country down. Maybe not too late to fix it, but all indications are that it is going the other way. Sad. Too bad. It once was a classy company.

### "would never fly this airline again"
Los Angeles to Minneapolis. Sun Country is a fraud. It offers "low cost" air fares but adds charges for your seats and, almost unbelievably, charges $40 for a carry-on which fits under a seat. This is outrageous and clearly a scam to make you think the cost of the flight is reasonable. Everything, except one small cup of a non-alcoholic beverage, costs more money. If this company had any business ethics, it would include the cost seat selections and for one carry-on in the price of the ticket so customers know the actual cost of a trip. I would never fly this scam airline again, no matter how convenient flights might be.

### "started delaying the flight"
Everything was fine until they started delaying the flight, first it started with 30min then an hour it went on and on until a 5hrs delay and they dont know the reason or dont want to tell us, worst experience ever, been in the airport since 7am because I came from another airline but it was only a 3hrs layover not a 10hrs one. If I could I will give a 0 but this won't let me.

### "tiny uncomfortable seats"
Minneapolis to Fort Myers. Used to be very good, now new ownership, tiny uncomfortable seats, crew seems to follow the take the money and run attitude by doing bare minimum, Don't fly this airline.

### "never fly Sun Country again!"
Minneapolis to Miami. I will never fly Sun Country again! It started by purchasing our tickets, only to find out that we would be charged a $30 fee per carry on and that we would need to pay for our seats! We never received any email for check in. We went online and paid all of these fees only to find out we couldn’t check in online and that we would have to stand in line at the airport even though we weren’t checking any bags. This extra line nearly caused us to miss our flight as Sun Country booked 26 flights within a 3 hour span! Pure chaos! After we got our boarding pass we learned that the seats we paid $25 a piece for were double booked and someone was already sitting in them. By the time we made it to our gate to take off, the flight was 50 minutes late! Do not fly Sun Country.

### "It was terrible"
Minneapolis to Honolulu. It was terrible and we haven’t even left to go home. We leave tomorrow and I’m terrified to get to the Airport and deal with these people! When we went to check in, the line was 3 hours long. We were able to move up because of our flight time but that made no difference because we stood at the check in counter for 1.5 hours with boarding passes that were invalid. When they finally figured that out, our seats were placed all over (2 adults and 5 kids) even though I originally paid for seats. They basically said too bad. I called today to make sure things were in check to go home tomorrow and see if they would assign us seats for free since we didn’t get the ones we paid for last weekend and she said no and told me to call customer service which isn’t even open today. Did I mention they lost one of our car seats? Not sure how that happen considering our connecting flight was on the same plane. Horrible airline. Will pay extra next time and fly an airline who has their stuff together.

### "Not a happy camper"
San Juan to Minneapolis. First off our flight was scheduled to leave at 2:55. We boarded at 3:55 and then sat on the plane for an hour before we took off. They didnt announce why we were just sitting there either. Then the flight was 5 hours long and a couple who bought 2 plane tickets sat next to me... with their baby. The baby screamed most of the plane ride. I had noise cancelling headphones on and could still hear the baby since it was right next to me. After that we got off the plane and went to get out luggage at the baggage claim. They took a whole hour just to put our bags out. We were waiting for another hour. Sun Country was not only 2 hours, but 3 hours late including everything. Not a happy camper.

### "nickeled and dimed throughout"
Boston to Minneapolis. Will never fly again. Was nickeled and dimed throughout the whole process. You think you’re buying an affordable flight, but then they make you pick a seat, then charge you for picking a seat. Then they make you pay $40 for one carry-on bag. Very disappointing. My first time flying Sun Country, and it will certainly be my last.

### "They don’t care about you"
Portland to Phoenix. By far the most unsophisticated crew from start to end. Flight change last minute notice, can’t check in online and nobody knows why, after spending 4 hours of our last day of vacation trying to reach the  rude people on other end of the line who had not one answer as to why we couldn’t check in. Get to airport to learn our carry ons cost $25 each. Not our problem we got flights booked in third rate airline. Spent all day at airport and nobody was staffed. They don’t care about you or your money.

### "no one has been helpful"
Not Verified |  On the 23rd of November I took a direct flight from SFO to MPS (Flight # SY396). When I arrived to MSP my checked bag was not there. I filed a claim in the office and was told by one of their representatives that it would be on the next flight on the 24th. I called multiple times in the past two weeks and no one has been helpful. I was told by two of your representatives that they would call SFO to see if the bag was still there and that they would call me back. But I never received any updates (November 26th and 29th). Today (12/3) I finally received a call that my bag had made it to MSP. The bag I checked would qualify as a carry on bag but I checked it because Sun Country charges more for a carry on versus a checked bag. In your Customer Service plan it states that, In the event a bag does not arrive on a passenger’s flight, we will make every reasonable effort to locate and return the bag within twenty-four hours and reimburse passengers for reasonable expenses that result due to delay in delivery. Considering that this was a direct flight this should not have been an issue. I would like to know what reimbursements I will be receiving. I have since sent an email about this poor service and haven’t heard back. Extremely disappointing.

### "will never fly Sun Country"
Phoenix to Minneapolis. I hesitantly booked my business flight with Sun Country. Unfortunately, booking with a discount carrier proved my nerves to be correct. The plane coming in was 3hrs late because of loading mail and 1” of snow. We boarded the plane and have been sitting for over 1 hour and the mail being unloaded is still not down and the luggage still has to be or back on! I respectfully say that I will never fly Sun Country. I watched 2 flights to MSP leave that were supposed to be after us. This is crazy. Please help the general public’s frustrations with the issues with this airline.

### "no communication whatsoever"
Las Vegas to New York via Minneapolis. Worst airline. My plane never left due to airplane issues and they never told us about it till 12pm and those who were going to JFK couldn’t fly till 3-4 days later. Insane, no communication whatsoever. Our flight was suppose to be at 9am.

### "needs to better train agents"
Sun Country gate agent at Harlingen TX airport offered us seats nearer front of plane, but didn't print boarding passes with those seat assignments. Sun Country needs to better train their agents to honor their commitments.

### "I still don't have my luggage"
Not Verified |  Sun Country lost my luggage. Actually they never even put it on the plane in New Orleans - I called the New Orleans airport the day I got home and they said they have never even heard of SunCountry. Finally talked to the airline to find out it was lost, a week later the Minneapolis airport contacted me with my luggage promising to Fed Ex it. Now it's been almost 2 weeks since I've been home! I've talked to three different people at Suncountry and MSP airport- I still don't have my luggage!

### "much to improve on"
Satisfied but they have much to improve on. I flew between Minneapolis to Orlando on Oct26th and again on Oct 28th in first class. I was surprised I got a 737 that still had first, most have been removed as they are converting to a completely low cost model. The thing to know is that you get what you pay for, flights are crowded because they are somewhat less expensive than others, the planes are older as they always have been with this airline and things just pretty much work. No in-flight entertainment unless you want to pay for it and this is being removed from their planes (my Sun country flight to Cancun did not have it) and they are saddled with some poor management decisions. The planes are older and usually somewhat dirty as they usually have under 15 minutes to turn them around and the ground staff is usually not knowledgeable because the current ownership is contracting for their Gate Agent and counter staff at a competing salary with McDonald's, so they are not the best. On the flip side, you get to where you are going in a seat that is fine with a usually very friendly flight staff and is you are flying out of MSP, flying out of Terminal 2 is a pleasure. Management has a lot of work to do, it has been obvious to me on the six flights that I have taken with them this year, but the flight staff have always been top notch, professional and courteous. Expect that the plane will be older and that the flight crew will be hurried, because they are and there is a good chance your flight will either be delayed for one reason or another or really, really rushed because it was somewhat delayed at the location it came from. If you fly with them knowing that these are the current issues, you'll be fine. Purchase your seat ahead of time, get to the gate early and pay to check your luggage and things will be fine, not great, just fine. I will fly them again and I wish their first class was staying, six wide in a 737 is really too small, but their price is still significantly less than others. Know all of this and you will be fine.

### "flight attendants were smiling and friendly"
I had a pleasant flight. Imagine flying before smart phones. No TV, no entertainment. Little leg room. However they offer a complimentary beverage and water after that. The flight attendants were smiling and friendly. The plane ride was smooth and we had little turbulence. If you expect it to be like a larger airline then you will not enjoy the flight, however if you are in need of a flight that’s a decent price to get you to your destination then this is great company. I would certainly fly with Sun Country Airlines again.

### Never flying with them again"
Seattle to New York via Minneapolis. Never seen such a terrible and unfriendly airline. Not to mention that my flight from SEA to MSP had a delay of 1.30h and I missed my connection flight to JFK; Sun Country staff forgot to load my 2 suitcases off the aircraft in MSP and I could pick them up after 2h in their office. I spent the night in a hotel because the next flight to JFK was at 6am the next day. The transportation costs back to the airport the next day were my own responsibility. Last but not least the 6am flight was overbooked and they rebooked me on a Delta flight. I had to check in my bags again and the $170 were my own responsibility again. A “very nice” lady from Sun Country’s costumer service told me “there’s nothing they could refund me for”. Never flying with them again - period.

### "not recommend Sun Country"
Minneapolis to Los Angeles. I would not recommend Sun Country. I have flown with them about 6 times in the last year, and almost every time something has gone wrong. My new, sturdy suitcases got ripped twice in their care. The first time they at least noticed and set it aside in the baggage claim, so that I didn't risk anything falling out and being lost. The second time, however, this was not the case and it came rolling down the baggage claim with it's huge rip, and the entire bottom half of the suitcase fell out when I picked it up. 3 of my flights have been delayed over a half-hour, not due to weather, but due to poor planning of arrivals and other take offs (once according to the captain himself). My worst experience, however, was when my flight was delayed over 2 hours, causing me and 9 other passengers to miss our connecting flight, a flight we all originally had plenty of time to get to without even changing terminals. Sun Country didn't land where it said it would on all of our tickets, and put us in a completely separate terminal with only 5 minutes to de-board the plane, hop on a tram, and get to the next terminal. When we as a group asked what Sun Country could do to help us still get to our final destination, as most of us had rides waiting for us there and it was late at night, they replied there was nothing they could do and there would be no refund for our missed flights because it "wasn't their fault because of the weather," yet other people I knew who flew out the same day from other airlines in the same airport with the same weather conditions made it out on time. For this, I would rate them 1 star for customer service and 1 star for ability of their crew/equipment and the quality of their planes. I have not experienced much better in-flight quality either. Their flights are usually crowded compared to any other major or smaller/local airlines I have flown in. The seats themselves are okay, fairly comfortable, but with no adjustable headrest like most airplanes have now, and with a somewhat difficult seat recliner. The quarters are cramped: smaller than usual aisles and much closer together seats with little legroom. There is also no in-flight entertainment, which is fine by me, but I know many other airlines offer this now. The free drinks are fine, but there's no in-flight free food, and I've had several somewhat grumpy stewards/stewardesses (it's probably not their fault though - these are very uncomfortable conditions to work in, and I'm sure they get many unhappy passengers because of the conditions as well). I would say you get what you pay for, but I've flown Delta for relatively the same price and Spirit for much less, and both were a much superior experience. These other airlines also did not tack on extra fees for choosing my economy seat or for having a carry-on. The only plus to flying Sun Country, in my opinion, is flying into slightly less busy terminals, which is always nice!

### "this airline was incredible"
Tampa to Dallas. Honestly, I saw the inexpensive price and I read the reviews and was hesitant because it didn’t have the best reputation. However, this airline was incredible. Very impressed with the cleanliness, leg room, free drink options, kindness of the staff and more. The downfall is the price for bags, but if you purchase a checked bag before the airport it is a reasonable price. You do not have to purchase a seat, though it seems that way, just hit skip and they’ll book one for you when you get to the airport. Overall, I was very pleased with the results.

### "less than helpful customer service"
Not Verified | Minneapolis to Phoenix. This airline used to be a good reliable carrier. It is no longer worth flying in my opinion. My wife has an upcoming flight originally scheduled as a morning departure, but after two changes is now a late afternoon departure resulting in her losing most of her first day of her trip. The fare was purchased during a sale offering, but after speaking with their less than helpful customer service representative, there is no question that the flight was never really scheduled. Per customer service, there are no gates available to use at the original departure time. If you consider that response, than the original scheduled departure was nothing more than 'bait and switch' to sell unscheduled space. While customer service did offer that a refund was available, and she could reschedule (at a much higher airfare), they also could not guarantee that that fight would depart at the scheduled time. If I could give less than 1 star, I would. Do not fly this airline, especially if you need to be somewhere at a specific time.

### "Never using Sun Country again"
Los Angeles to Minneapolis. My wife and I fly once a year to visit family in Southern California. We have always flown first class Sun Country out of MSP. We've had some complaints over the years but over-looked them due to the value. But this is literally beyond words. We had already purchased our tickets, flew to L.A. and boarded the flight home when we realized the plane back to MSP had no first class seats. Apparently, Sun Country bought some new (to them) aircraft that are all coach seats. We were told by the crew that first class was the first 3 rows (of coach seats) and we got stuck in their “transition” (of phasing out). So the salad, brownie and drink was supposed to be worth the extra 500 bucks we paid for first class! The FA told me to email the CEO and complain. Then hopefully he'll do the right thing and refund some money. So now, I'm supposed to write a letter in the hopes that they'll do the right thing and refund some money? I won't hold my breath. They even told us that they were upgrading people in the airport before boarding to first class and that those customers were upset too. I guess they thought that would make us feel better? I was offered no other solution other than joining their points program to get 50 bucks worth of free points. Never using Sun Country again. Their deceptive practices lost them this formerly loyal customer.

### "a terrible airline"
Not Verified |  Minneapolis to Boston. Bought e-tickets for a family of 4; had an excellent experience traveling to Boston from MSP but this was with Jet Blue. For some reasons, our return flight was with Sun Country. What a terrible airline! We only had one bag to check in just as we had with JetBlue. They immediately said that we will have to pay for everything we will take with us on the aircraft, except for “something like a purse”. They made us pay for our kids little bags and made sure we understood that we would pay $50 to check both in or $80 if we wanted to take them as carry-ons. Now, I understand that every airline has its own policy re: luggage etc, but the differential pricing is just a ripoff. They never let you know of those restrictions when you purchase the tickets. I hope I never have to fly Sun country again.

### "It was hotter then hell"
Orlando to Minneapolis. Run on the mill room and drink/snack options. It was hotter then hell the first 90 minutes of the flight. I used them for a trip from Jamaica earlier this year and has the same problems but figured things happens but now they’re 0-2. The flight boarded late and they told us we’d be on time once we got in the air. Then they announced we were beginning to land and be on the ground in 30 and it took nearly an hour. Then it took another 30 minutes before they finally started sending bags out.

### "flight attendants were friendly"
Phoenix to Minneapolis. Both to and from Arizona there were delays because of maintenance issues. We were sent to a different airplane and delayed an hour, both flights. Chose Sun Country because it was the cheapest. Just got unlucky, flight attendants were friendly and smooth flights.

### "Very, very cramped"
Las Vegas to Minneapolis. 2 hour delay with little to no updates from podium staff. Cabin hot, no a/c. Very, very cramped for space. Save your baggage fees and spend the extra money on a better airline. (Delta) they do not charge for carry on luggage and they offer free snacks and free entertainment.

### "do not recommend"
Not Verified |  JFK to Las Vegas via Minneapolis. Sun Country left my luggage somewhere during a recent trip to Vegas. My husband and I had packed in one bag and had no clothing or toiletries. I had to purchase toothpaste, toothbrushes, and contact lens solution and cases, and wash my travel clothes in our hotel tub. Thento top it off, it's one month later and we still have yet to receive any confirmation of our claim, or any response at all from their "service" department. Terrible service. Will not fly again, and do not recommend.

### "had good service, until today"
Portland to Minneapolis. Ive flown with Sun Country multiple times and have had good service, until today. I live in Portland and my mom was visiting but she had to fly home early due to an emergency back home in Minnesota. We purchased her a one way flight last minute, we tried to check her in online but the website kept saying “error, please try again later” so we had to check in at the airport. My mom gets there and the lady at the front desk for Sun Country told her to go check in at the self serve station, she got there and Every other airline except  Sun Country had an option to check in. So my mom went to go back to the desk and the lady was gone. It took someone 45 minutes to get back to the desk but of course it was too late and the plane already boarded and shut the cabin. After being on the phone for 52 min and 3 calls later the customer service lady told us the plane had been delayed for another hour and a half but they weren’t going to Print her a boarding pass because she didn’t check in on time. The plane was at the gate and wasn’t going to take off for another hour and a half and they had already deboarded the plane only to reboard in an hour. But they said she still  couldn’t have a boarding pass because the delay wasn’t there fault. After making another call to customer service they finally told someone to come down and print her a boarding pass. This all could’ve been avoided if Sun Country could get there act together.

### "baggage has not been returned"
Honolulu to Los Angeles. I recently submitted an airline review on Aug 12, 2018, regarding my experience prior to the the actual flight. Post flight leaving Honolulu on Aug 12 & arriving LA on Aug 13 at 4am (Flight SY730). My experience POST flight prompted me to make a follow up review and complaint. I hope our experience as a passenger will reach the top people managing this company. We checked in total of 3 luggages, upon claiming the baggage, 2 were returned (mine and my daughter) one lost baggage for my husband. I used to work for the airline myself & I never thought there will be problem like this that has not been solved since it is a common problem to most travelers. the “lost baggage”. In LAX there is no specific booth for Sun Country where to ask if problems like this arise. Hawaiian Airlines has a lady in their booth where you can querry and she (a Hawaiian Airlines personnel) directed us upstairs to a place next to Spirit Airlines but she stated its an office for Sun but there is no name outside the door. She herself has a hard time describing the location for us. When we get there, there were 3 doors with security lock without names. Is was so frustrating having to wait, on board a delayed flight, without sleep, & still has to go work in few hours. We tried to search for direction on line, number provided was called and no one answers. A lady just about to enter one of those unmarked rooms & apparently she just came in for her shift. Thank God she is from Sun. She accompany us to find our missing luggage that didn’t come out of the conveyor and helped us file a report. I did ask her why there is no name on the door of her office so their client can easily find where to go. She stated and I quote “I dont know, I asked the same question when Sun initially hired me but they don’t have answers for me, I guess no one wants to do anything”. She then instructed us to call the number on that paperwork she provided for us. When we get home we called the number (612) 970 3576, unfortunately the call often dropped and no way we can leave a message. Later that day, a lady left a voice message on my phone stating they found our baggage/luggage and to contact them thru customer service or on line but she did not leave any contact number to call. I tried calling the number thru caller ID, it was the same number I found on line, but then again, call dropped no one can be reached. I went back on line on the baggage lost so I can at least send a message. I did gave instruction to deliver my luggage to the address I provided. Its a very long and tiring process just to contact that department and I think its a very common airline problem that they are failing to handle, in the end their customers suffer. And up this point, making this review, my baggage has not been returned. I hope whoever read this message will do something on this issue and hopefully someone will contact me again again.

### "The bag never showed up "
Dallas to Las Vegas. We just returned late last night from a once in a lifetime 30th birthday celebration that had been carefully planned by my wife for months. The flight was delayed and our bag was lost by Sun Country. We had to buy all new clothing and accessories to get through our stay. The bag never showed up even though we called the airline numerous times. It is now day 4, no bag and no return calls. We have no plans to ever use this airline again but we do expect reimbursement for our lost items!

### "Flight got delayed"
New York JFK to Biloxi. Passengers troubled with no cooling in the plane, too hot. Flight got delayed, nobody at the gate to update Passengers. After requesting someone at next counter, they called someone to be there. After all flight went to the runway after around 5 hour delay just to let us know that there's crew rest time so they took all Passengers back to gate. No one available to answer. Everyone said that they will never travel with Sun Country airlines again. Everyone still at the baggage claim at 2am not knowing what to do. Actual flight time was 7:55 pm August 01, 2018

### "I will never fly again"
It was a terrible experience! When we arrived at the Honolulu airport there wasn’t even a sign for this airline and it was difficult to find the counter. When checking-in, we suddenly realize we should pay for carry-on bags ($40 each!) and the only free bag allowed was the personal bag (a very small bag). When I complained about this hidden cost, they rudely replied that is the luggage policy of the company. Then I decided to checked-in all my bags for $25 each which sounded less expensive! On board nothing is provided for free and they did not have any blankets even though the air conditioning was not adjustable and there was a North Pole temperature. Personnel was kind and helpful. I will never fly again with Sun Country Airlines!

### "So many hidden fees"
Flew New York City to Minneapolis. Time and time again I have found reasons to avoid Sun Country Airlines. So many hidden fees for everything from selecting seats (which most airline include for free when selected immediately before boarding) to even carrying ONE simple bag with you. You pay for a seat on the plane and that is it. No frills, no courtesy, no ability to bring any clothes with you unless you are willing to pay. The crew for boarding the plane was rude and curt. This is the worst airline I have ever had experience with. I never plan on flying it again and I would advise others to do the same if they want a pleasant experience.

### Sun Country Airlines customer review
Minneapolis to San Francisco. I had used Sun Country once before last year, and quite enjoyed my flight but I was blindsided by the fact that I had experienced first class as a Christmas gift which included carry on and baggage, as well as food and movie entertainment. Fast forward to today. I had purchased a ticket to visit friends in Minneapolis. I found that within a short year, things had changed for the worst. I didn’t realize I had to pay extra for not only my carry on, but for my seat as well. Nothing is included for regular flyers which means no snacks or tv. My flight was cancelled and I was only given a $10 food voucher that didn’t work for most of the food places in the airport. It was utterly useless and an appalling form of apology/compensation for someone who has to wait 12 hours now just to get home.

### "not worth the cheaper flight"
Dallas Ft Worth to Las Vegas. The absolute worst flight experience of my life. After being bussed from my gate to a remote area on the tarmac to load the plane on an obnoxious zig zag ramp just to sit on the un-air conditioned plane for 45 minutes sweating. I will never ever fly this airline again. Arrived an hour late to our destination because of the unorganized boarding process. To top it off we have to go thru the same exact process on the way home as the flight is 50 minutes behind because of leaving DFW late again. It looked to have mildew coming from around the vents or just really dirty at the top of the plane and the seats are worn out. I didn’t even risk using the restroom. Most definitely not worth the cheaper flight.

### "Finger prints and face prints"
Cozumel to Dallas. Walking onto the plane I knew it was going to be a long flight as the airplane looked like it was from the 70s. All of the ash trays that are located in the armrest were full of trash and looked like they had never been cleaned. Finger prints and face prints covered over half of the windows. Once we were in the air I put my tray down to find out the left brace holding it up was broken and my brother, who was sitting beside me, also had a broken tray. The only reason I would give this flight a mediocre review is the staff was all extremely friendly during the flight.

### "like a bad first date"
Los Angeles to Minneapolis, never again. By the time the checked bag fees (no carry on allowed), seat choice fees (separate from actually getting the seats), confirmed seat fees etc it would have been hundreds of dollars cheaper to fly a better airline. The leg room or lack thereof is ludicrous. I'm only 5'10" and when the person in front of me reclined their seat the 1/4 inch that was available it hit my knees! Like I said, it was like a bad first date. Why would I agree to such punishment ever again?

### "would never fly again"
Anchorage to Seattle. Horrible. Basically no head rest, no leg room. Only a personal item, the carry on costs extra. No free snacks, yes there are free sodas and water. Overall would never fly again. We flew to Alaska and back home to Seattle on sun country. Both times we boarded late. Bag checks on departure to Alaska took 30+ minutes because of one lady working the desk with no help. She wasn’t very nice.

### "never use this airline again"
Los Angeles to Minneapolis. This is absolutely the worst airline I have ever dealt with the people at the front desk at LAX were so rude and accommodating and unprofessional. I had a business class flight all the way through that I had purchased through Condor and I am put in a economy class which is unacceptable. I will never use this airline again.

### "never fly with them again"
Not Verified | This is the worst airline company. I will never fly with them again. As much as I do not like it, it is a reasonable expectation to get charged for a checked bag. What is not reasonable and is ridiculous is the fact that they charge $40 dollars for using the overhead compartment. So for two checked bags and the use of the overhead compartment I had to pay $90 dollars. Not only that the seat I was in had a tiny space to store a personal item on the floor, my backpack barely fit. The only good thing I can say is the the crew members were friendly. Other than that I do not recommend this horrible airline company and will never fly with them again.

### "a very hard experience"
Not Verified |  San Francisco to New York via Minneapolis. The term "you get what you pay for" is an understatement when it comes to Sun Country Airlines. This was a very hard experience. This was the very first time on any Airline where I did not have Wi-Fi access or service for real food, and there was no in flight movies to enjoy either. I was flying with my children and was told that I would need to purchase seating in order for us to all be together; it was their first flight to New York. Fortunately, we did not choose that option because we were trying to save some money for our vacation. Upon arrival at the international side of SFO we were greeted by a very friendly checker who accommodated us and assisted us with our seating arrangements free of charge. Of course, we did have to arrive at the airport almost two and a half hours prior to our flight. Our flight was delayed in Minneapolis and there was an issue with the fuel. However, by 1 am we finally made it to JFK. Unfortunately, I will never participate with this airline. Customers should be given a bit more bang for their buck and not be treated like second class citizens.

### "Worst flight"
Laughlin to Spokane. Worst flight I have ever been on. This flight was through Total Rewards. 3 emails were sent to notify passengers of arrival times. The idiots in charge of this flight (flight crew) took it upon themselves to change the route. This action turned a 2 hour flight into a 4 hour flight.

### "they're going downhill"
Not Verified |  Minneapolis to Boston. I've used this airline dozens of times over the years and they're going downhill. The counter service is often understaffed and slow, sometimes malfunctioning as well. Online services arent much better. Their quality is becoming cheaper and more complicated, with too many baggage/carry on options, none of which are free, and with smaller seats than most Minnesotans can stand. This airline used to be tolerable, but now it's worth upgrading to most other airlines.

### "worst airline experience"
Not Verified |  By far the worst airline experience. I can travel halfway around the world without losing my bags (yes, that’s plural Sun Country) but flying from Dallas to Punta Cana and back and they have no idea where my bag is. After day 3 of no bag, we were told it went to Mexico. We were asked to send an email that would generate an immediate response (this was 4 days ago and still no response). You call customer service which claim that take baggage claim very seriously but that’s clearly not the case. No one works on the weekend. On top of losing my bag, they pack their customers on the planes like sardines. We traveled with a group of 6 and didn’t even sit remotely close to anyone. I’d rather take a rough boat ride back to Punta Cana than ride in another Sun Country plane. I don’t have a choice but the overall rating is actually a 0/10.

### "Very cramped and crowded"
Seattle to Minneapolis. An hour late from Minneapolis to Seattle. Over two hours late on the return flight. Very cramped and crowded in the plane. Bathrooms on plane were not adequate enough for the amount of people on board. Poor design and layout. Definitely not an airline I'd pick to do business with again. Waste of time and money. No pride in their business and lack of urgency.

### "a terrible time"
Not Verified |  Dallas to Punta Cana. The only thing on this flight that was worth anything were the employees. We had a terrible time trying to get first class seats. We had a one hour delay for a "unknown reason" while departing. This was our 1st first class flight and the onboard food was pitiful. I am currently laying in the Punta Cana airport that has zero air conditioner and our flight just got delayed for an hour and a half. Over all this is by far the worst company I have ever flown with/ever had one complaint with.

### "not communicated with us yet"
Fort Myers to Minneapolis. My family and I had a flight from Florida to Minneapolis booked when the big snow storm hit in April. Sun Country handled the airport closure incredibly poorly. No communication before or during the cancellation. Their customer service line was not receiving calls. They never attempted to call us or email us, not even with a standard notification that the flight was canceled. We tried calling multiple times the day before the storm/day before our flight, and multiple times the day of. No way through. Same for the following day, so we drove to the airport and talked to someone. They had no backup system for all the displaced customers. They wouldn't book us on another flight of their own and wouldn't work with a different airline to get us home. The next available seat was not for 5 more days. And that was for 1 of the 4 of us. So we ended up renting a car and driving for two days. We had to call Kayak/Priceline to talk about a refund. They said it would take 4 to 6 weeks and only cover half our ticket, at the most. I received an email 6 weeks later from "Flexrez" stating the airline approved the request for a refund. There was no case number and no contact info, again. It said to find their Help section on the website if we had questions. I don't even know what website to look at for it. Kayak, Priceline, Sun Country, or flexrez? Sun Country has not communicated with us yet. This is a Minnesota-based company who screwed over all of their customers who flew in and out of Minneapolis those two days.

### "not recommend this airline"
Not Verified |  We waited to check our luggage for three hours, due to 2 agents working 3 different flight check ins. When we were finally checked in, the flight was delayed over an hour because the check in was so behind schedule. Not only did we wait far too long, but upon arriving in Vegas, our luggage was no where to be found and the airline said they were not sure where it was sent. We have tried contacting to locate our luggage and we have been put on hold for 90 minutes. I would not recommend this airline to anyone!

### "ruined our vacation"
Not Verified |  Dallas to Punta Cana . When checking in, I asked for the attendant to tag our luggage we were checking and she confirmed she would. After being checked in for our flight we were not given a bag tag and directed to security. We are now on vacation and no one has been able to locate our luggage to get to us. We had no layover and there is no sense of urgency to have it back in our possession. Our entire vacation has been ruined and we literally have no clothes, toiletries, our jewelry, shoes, and everything else. When we initially called the airline when arriving in the Dominican the person we spoke to on Sun country’s behalf told us "It is your problem you are there in another country". Absolutely unacceptable and we are now having to spend hundreds of dollars per day on clothes and things we need. This issue has completely ruined our vacation and we continue to call daily and no one can locate or luggage. We had no lay overs so it can only be in one other place if it is not here. After today I will never use this airline again and will advise others not to as well.

### "I was treated so poorly"
Los Angeles to Minneapolis. I had poor customer service from start to finish. I was told upon check in that my self and people I was traveling with had too many bags. I informed the representative that I would reduce my bags before boarding the plane. I was watched from the moment I left. Upon boarding the plane I had two bags which was one personal and one carry on. Myself and my party were watched and harrassed as we boarded the plane. She also tried to charge us $40 for a shoe box that my friend had along with his backpack. Once on the plane, staff from the lax terminal 5 got on the plane to harass us more. She came to write down my seat number and check our bags once again. We never exchanged words or said anything derogatory or bad to the employee. I am appalled that I was treated so poorly after paying almost $500 each for first class seats on a one way flight home. Customer service was poor and I will never fly Sun Country  again.

### "the total lack of effort"
Denver to Minneapolis. After arriving at 10:40am to get through security, my husband, 5 year old son and I waited through multiple delays. Flight 658 had mechanical issues, yet we kept being told the mechanics were confident they could fix the issue. After receiving the replacement part at 8pm, we were told we’d board at nine. Then 9:45. Then announced they’d have “more details to come” at 10pm, and same announement at 10:30 and 11pm. At about 11:50 (too late to catch a different flight out for the night), it was announced that the flight was cancelled. We are irate that nothing was done to try to help, no alternatives suggested, no options given, nothing. My 5year old slept on the floor of the airport for a flight that should have  departed at 12:20 pm! In order to get back to MN in time for a job interview, we immediately called and booked 3 seats on a flight leaving Denver at 6 am with a different airline. We spent $876 dollars for something we would not have otherwise needed to spend, just to make it back in time for the 11:30am CDT job interview - after already spending $342 on the 3 Sun Co tickets booked in early April! We have not seen the $342 reimbursed yet, but expect it will be. I will never fly through this airline again, and I will advise friends and family do the same. The whole experience was miserable, horrific. And I am disgusted at the total lack of effort to do anything to help get passengers to Minneapolis.

### "they were unwilling to do anything"
I am extremely disappointed and dissatisfied with my Sun Country trip from Minneapolis to Miami. I have had issues with Sun Country before but never to this extent. I was on hold attempting to make flight reservations for over an hour and 46 minutes. Almost a two hour wait to make simple reservations is outrageous. I was met by a rude Sun Country employee. Throughout the conversation he interrupted me multiple times, he raised his voice at me, and refused to let me speak to a supervisor stating “they would tell you the same so you cannot speak to them”. I have worked in customer service for many years and have never been spoken to in that manner. I have flown with Sun Country quite often before but will never fly with them again. I attempted to address this issue with their complaint department and they were unwilling to do anything to fix the situation. The only thing they were willing to do was comp my seats as “an act of good faith”, I said ok fine I will sit in row 7 because I want to be near the front which I would’ve paid for regardless. I was told no to that request they would only be willing to Comp a seat in row 23 of 24 rows. I asked so you guy are willing to comp a 7 dollar seat but unwilling to comp a 15 dollar seat to please an upset customer? They said yes that is the case. How disrespectful and rude. I recommend no one flies with Sun Country unless they want horrible service from a company who doesn’t value their business.

### "we were waiting for 20 minutes"
Minneapolis to new York JFK. My flight was a nightmare. We were supposed to leave at 7:00 but we were waiting for 20 minutes. No communication with the passengers on why the flight was delayed it was ridiculous. The mere question of me asking why we didn’t leave at 7 aroused anger in the flight attendants. They were too busy flirting with some guy that works at the kiosk to even stop to answer my question. I really hate this airline.

### "there was no notification at all"
Our experience with Sun Country Airlines was completely frustrating. We boarded our flight in San Diego and were told we needed to exit the plane just before it was about to leave the terminal since the connecting flight to JFK was cancelled due to weather. That part is unavoidable, we understand. We then went directly to an available agent to book for the following day only to be told that if we wanted to be on a flight for the next day it would cost us an additional $2200 (2 seats in first class)! Although those seats were available they would not accommodate us. We had no choice but to book for the day after. That flight left San Diego an hour late. When we arrived in Minneapolis with little time to spare we noticed our flight was not listed on the "departures" screen. We went back the gate we came through to be told that our connecting flight was cancelled. We were not told this on the plane, we were not told this when we exited the plane, there was no notification at all. We then needed to wait 45 minutes in line to book for the following day (no morning flights although seats in 1st class were again available). We were given vouchers for discounts for nearby hotels since they claimed no responsibility due to it being "weather related". We later learned that this was not weather related at all, it was their equipment malfunction at JFK. There were no hotels available through the discounted phone # they gave us and we were left on our own to find accommodations. Our entire experience with Sun Country was unpleasant at best including robotic agents, uncaring attitudes, and all around unprofessionalism. Never again!

### "flight attendants were below average"
Worst airline experience ever! Utterly disappointed in overall service. Purchased first class seats for 2 adults and 7 children. We had never been in first class before but decided to splurge as we had a birthday to celebrate. We also have a daughter recovering from leukemia so it was important that we try to make her comfortable and be as close to the restroom as possible. First of all, we were overcharged $6,000 when we made the reservations in August due to some kind of computer glitch. No apologies from the airline and it took almost a week for reimbursement. Note for anyone buying a ticket from Sun Country, always use a credit card, never a debit card. The flight from Orlando to Minneapolis was a disaster. The seats were dirty even though the flight was delayed 30 minutes. We even found a novel left in 1D from the previous occupant. Magazines were askew, crumbs were on our seats, and one seat had some kind of fluid on it. Yuck! Flight attendants had plenty of time to clean the cabin given the delay. An airline employee sat in my husband's seat (1C) doing paperwork for 30 minutes. There were plenty of open seats in the cabin where he could have moved to. My husband, who is 6'4", was forced to hunch forward and later squat down while waiting for his seat. Not exactly first class service! The biggest problem? They lost our largest piece of luggage! Sun Country promises first class priority delivery to baggage claim. We have never lost a piece of luggage before and it happened on a first class flight. I was promised that it would come in the next morning on the first flight and would be delivered by late morning. That didn't happen. I had to call them 18 hours later to check on the status. It took until 8 pm to get it. Sun Country's flight attendants were below average and the leg room was average. Airplane cleanliness was way below average! There was no first class priority boarding. We were unable to put our baggage in the overhead compartments as we were being pushed from behind as everyone crowded in. The meal (1/2 a sandwich) was horrible. There were no options and one of my children received a leftover sandwich that someone else hadn't wanted. They also ran out of Coke! 7 of the 12 first class passengers were children and they ran out of Coke! Did they expect me to order them alcohol? Do not expect a curtain between first class and the cabin. My daughter was seated in front of someone who was coughing on her neck the whole flight. Also, everyone kept using the bathroom in the front and were lined up in the first class cabin constantly coughing and bumping into us. The flight attendants did nothing to discourage this. At least with a curtain, passengers do not stand in line in first class waiting for the bathroom. I reached out to customer service and I sent an email to every member of the board of directors. I did this on December 21st. It is now January 9th and no one has contacted me. I did expect an apology or an explanation for our horrible experience. I am left to wonder if we were treated poorly because we complained about being over charged $6,000 in August. After all, how many bad things could possibly happen on the same first class flight?

### "my flights were smooth and enjoyable"
Incredible experience from beginning to end. I was due to fly out on the day a massive snowstorm hit the northeast. Sun Country, like many other airlines in Boston, waived their change fee. After almost no time on hold, I was helped by one of the friendly customer service agents I have ever experienced. She helped me quickly and efficiently, and got me on a flight a few days later. When the day to fly came, the experience remained completely positive. Both of my flights were smooth and enjoyable. The ground service came with a smile. The flight crew were friendly and attentive for both flights. I’m a little guy, but I had plenty of legroom in my seat (16A). The cabin was clean and felt inviting. My connection in Minneapolis was also an absolute breeze. It was only 50 minutes, but navigating their Terminal H was a piece of cake. I absolutely recommend Sun Country and will be flying with them anytime that I can. Sure, there’s no in-flight entertainment or WiFi, but bring a book and some music and you’ll be fine. Adjust your expectations accordingly, and you’ll realize what an incredible value they are. Go try them out and relearn what it’s like to be treated like a real person again.

### "Only 2 counters were open"
60 mins is usually enough to make your flight when using Sun Country's tiny Humphrey terminal. However, there were long lines and travellers checking in lots of bags. Only 2 counters were open. SY has no self-check machines. All I needed was to just print my boarding pass. Line took 30 minutes to clear and it was too late. I could not get my boarding pass forwarded to my email or mobile phone. Check-in agent didn't care. Said he could do nothing and did not even offer to re-book me. So I re-booked myself onto a comfortable DL flight. In June, I flew MSP-JFK and our aircraft had a row of broken seats causing a 90 minute delay. Old aircraft in bad shape. Tickets are not that much cheaper. Avoid.

### "customer service just fantastic"
I travelled with my 81-year-old mother, who was in a wheelchair. This airline provided her with every assistance she could need, from the moment we entered the airport until the moment we left the airport on the other end. They changed her seat to give us more leg room. Their customer service was just fantastic. On our first leg out, we had a mechanical issue on the plane, which delayed our flight by 4 hours. There was some grumbling in the gate area, but the ground crew kept everyone informed of where things stood and were just great. We were allowed to pre-board when we did get to take off, and were surprised to see not a single person who wasn't smiling when they got on the plane. It's a testament to their customer service that they could keep people smiling even with a 4-hour delay. Great job.

### "customer service did not nothing"
Booked to fly Los Angeles to Minnesota with Sun Country Airlines. Worst airline ever. Canceled the flight after an 8 hour delay. I spent 3+ hours on the phone and customer service did not nothing but put me on hold, took me off hold, put me back on hold and then did not solve the problem and just hung up. Unprofessional airline that puts profits ahead of customer service.

### "do not recommend this airline"
New York to Las Vegas via Minneapolis. Honestly the worst airline I've ever flown. First time using them and definitely the last. First flight was late, connecting flight was also late because they were missing a "sticker" in the cockpit - 25 minutes later were finally taking off. I do not recommend this airline to anyone.

### "being left on hold for an hour"
Las Vegas to New York via Minneapolis. While this review occured during a serious attack that closed down the airport. And I understand that there will be some stress to a company that has to deal with a closed down airport. I am commenting on the service I recieved from every level of their support staff. We waited around for 5 hours, and they didn't have any answers, completely understandable, out of their control and forgivable. Canceling a flight in this situation is  forgivable. What is not forgivable is, being left on hold for an hour waiting to talk to "reservations", only to be told that the next available flight is available two nights later. When I asked to be put on another airline in their IROP group, she hung up on me. I then talked to their ground support staff, which told lies about their being mystical support staff on another level of the airport, which none of the fellow passengers had seen. So after wasting an hour trying to find imaginary support staff, I talk to their manager who reiterated that all she could do is refund, or put me on a stand by list for the next flight, with no connector lined up. So I asked for a refund. I suggest you skip the big run around, and take your money elsewhere, you're probably going to end up at the destination. I recommend Sun Country get a coherent support staff who are on the same page, and plan for emergencies. It's inexcusable to only offer to sit someone on a plane two nights later, when there are half full planes going to the destination which you use in other situations. Because of them I'm $200 out of pocket.

### "the flight had been cancelled"
Minneapolis to Washington. I booked a flight with Sun Country through my Chase Sapphire rewards program. I had read online that you can't check in online with Sun Country if you book through a 3rd party, but when I arrived at the airport, they told me the flight had been cancelled because not enough people booked it! I received no notifications about the change, and Sun Country said it wasn't their problem because it wasn't booked with them. The next flight wasn't until the next day. They didn't offer me a refund of my ticket and "couldn't" tell me if any other airline had a flight going out to my destination. I have to call (along with my credit card company) and fight with them about a refund. Why would I ever book with them again knowing how likely they are to pull the plug on my flight? These little podunk airlines seem like a good way to save money, but they aren't since you'll spend way more than the original ticket to buy a last minute ticket with another airline. Never again.

### "Both of my flights were delayed"
Sun Country is awful. I bought a ticket from BOS to SFO because it was cheap - don't make the same mistake as me! Do yourself a favor and avoid this company at all costs. With most airlines, if you get delayed or miss a connection, the airline will re-route you and get you to your destination within a reasonable timeframe. However, Sun Country only has one scheduled flight for each destination per day. If your flight is delayed and you miss your connection, then you need to wait 24 hours for the next flight! They do not provide hotel expense nor help you buy a ticket on a different airline. You are just stuck waiting 24 hours for your next flight. And the problem is that Sun Country has delays all the time. Both of my flights were delayed over 1.5 hours. On my return flight, this delay made me miss my connection to Boston. So I missed a day of work and I was confronted with the choice of paying for a hotel room or living in the airport for another 24 hours. What kind of airline sells you a ticket, knowing that over 50% of the time, you will need to overnight at the airport?

### "What is wrong with Sun Country"
Minneapolis to San Francisco. What is wrong with good old Sun Country?! Easy to get thru this little terminal plus great art. But upon entering plane, we were told that we'd take off 10 minutes early. Once seated we were told there was a 20 minutes delay beyond our original departure time. We arrived 15 minutes late but also had to sit on the plane for another 20 minutes because they said the airport wasn't ready for us. When we got baggage claim we route told that the belt broke and we should wait another 15 minutes for repair!

### "provide great service"
Minneapolis to Dallas. I was nervous because I was flying in on an international flight with a different airline and had not been able to check in to Sun Country Airlines online or at the gate internationally. I knew I had a close connection and had no idea how I was going to get through immigration and customs, get my bag, check in and re-check my bag, and get back through security before my flight took off. I was so impressed when their staff Andrew met me and the other passengers on my connecting flight the moment we stepped off the plane. He walked us through customs, waited with us for our bags, checked us in at the counter, and helped us good through security with time to spare. It could not have been lower stress. I wish I could have service like that all the time. A huge thank you to all the people who provide great service on Sun Country!

### "staff extremely friendly"
I had never heard of Sun Country Airlines before and was apprehensive about flying with them from Boston to Minneapolis. The entire staff from on ground to the inflight were extremely friendly. The boarding was efficient, we left and got in early, and I would fly with them again any day.

### "seats were roomy in both legroom and width"
I need extra leg room and the exit seats for the flight out were not available so I purchased a first class ticket. My expectations were low based on seeing first class customers on previous flights. There is no divider between coach and first class so it doesn't look very special. I was wrong. Can't recall how much extra I paid but it included a couple of checked bags. They marked my luggage priority and it was the first one to land on the carousel when we arrived. The seats were roomy in both legroom and width. Comfortable, too. The plane seemed very clean and bright inside. I wasn't paying close enough attention but it seemed like the flight attendant was always available. They served a decent meal that I wasn't expecting, offered free video screens, had fresh baked chocolate chip cookies and hot towels at the end of the trip. The attendant did a great job of making us feel "first class". I don't do alcohol but I assume that was available as well. I plan on doing this again. Was in the exit row on the return trip. Once again great flight attendants and since there were three open exit row seats on the opposite side she moved the couple next to me to the unoccupied seats and I had all 3 seats to myself. All the folks at the ticket counter were pleasant and helpful.

### "appreciated the flight crew"
New York JFK to Portland via Minneapolis. I'm a newly disabled 27 year old woman who flew alone with my 12 month old on a last second trip. That had the potential to be a pretty horrible situation, but the crew on all four of my flights during our cross country trip were fantastic. They helped me on and off the plane and gave me advice on how to make the flight easier. They gave me cups and stuff to help keep my son entertained. They even helped me sort out a couple of problems I had at the airport. The flights were on time or early and the pilot kept us up to date on significant landmarks we were passing. I brought my own tablet and phone for offline entertainment, but they did offer a digital system for a small fee. Beverages were free but snacks and food cost money. They did not accept cash, only cards. Overall, I enjoyed my flight, appreciated the flight crew, loved the price, and would certainly book with them again.

### "substantial delays"
Grand Rapids to Gulfport. This is the second time flying Sun Country Airlines and both times with substantial delays. The first time was in January and had a 2.5 hour delay on the tarmac. Now today we are going on 4 hours with only 2 updates. Once on the plane everything is good but the delays are ridiculous! Plan on sitting several extra hours in the airport if you fly Sun Country.

### "I was very impressed"
❎ Unverified |  Minneapolis to Mexico. The flight was just fine I had no issues with any portion of the flight, but the flight is not the purpose of my review. My daughter left her wallet in the seat pocket and didn't discover it until we were in the hotel. I called a random number I found online (after 10 pm) no one answered, I left no message, about 5 minutes later a guy called me back and I told him what happened. He gave a number to call so I did. Got a message the office was closed (again it's after 10 pm) so I left a voice mail. By 8:30 the next morning I got a call from their staff saying she had the Wallet and we could come and pick it up. I was very impressed with how fast it all happened by just in a panic calling the first number I found online.

### "can only check in at airport"
Las Vegas to Minneapolis. Buyer beware, if you purchase your ticket through a 3rd party you can only check in at the airport, not online, not even if you call Sun Country Airlines directly. So, then we arive at the the airport to check in 6 hours early only to sit in separate rows, with my son 4 rows back. Then we have to wait outside of the the security check for 3 hours before they will check our bag. Nice "home town" airline. Not again.

### "the service was awesome"
Boston to Minneapolis. I thought I should give a review of this airline given the fact that I had not heard of Sun Country Airlines before and was extremely nervous due to the fact that it was not known to many that I had talked to. I had a problem with booking because the customer service agent had not booked my daughter. The moment I talked to them, they were extremely good and also during the trip, the service was awesome. What I enjoyed more was how the pilot kept updating the passengers on the route. They are so friendly and I really enjoyed the trip.

### "I was badly disappointed"
This flight was a Sun Country flight on a plane tagged Transavia flying from Minneapolis, MN to Orlando, FL. The plane was old and the interior seats were uncomfortable. The width of the seat put the arm rest on top of my legs in comfort plus seats! I've never had an arm rest do that. Additionally, the seats reclined into my knees in an upgraded seat. This is not the expected experience with travel and I was badly disappointed. There was no indication at booking that the plane was not the typical Sun Country plane. I'm saddened to review our hometown airline this way.

### "they could not have been nicer"
Minneapolis to Phoenix. I just wanted to give the Sun Country Airlines staff a 5 star review for their handling of my dog flying in cargo. They could not have been nicer every step of the way, for both outward and return flights. If you have any hesitation of taking your pet with you on a vacation, try Sun Country.

### "really friendly staff"
New York to Las Vegas via Minneapolis with Sun Country. On arrival in New York I knew it was going to be a good experience just by the smiles from the staff when we checked in. Really friendly staff. Had opted to go for the flight that changed at Minneapolis. All went fine without a hitch. Cabin crew on both flights friendly. Comfortable enough planes. While people need to remember it is a low cost airline I am giving them a 10 because I thought the whole service was outstanding. The staff put themselves out to get me the train info to travel to Minneapolis train station as there was about 6 hour connection.

### "they have zero systems in place for actual customer service"
Our flight from Minneapolis to Seattle was cancelled with no notification given unless you were staring at the boards or had your phone on the website. There were no associates on site and if I hadn't called, I never would have known that they scheduled us on a flight 5 hours later. Then I learned that we had to go back out to the main ticket counter in order to get a new ticket and then back through security. Any other airline would have a staffed desk at the gate and the ability to print tickets. I'm sure TSA just loves that they send people out just to get back in their line. I'd fly Southwest anytime, it worth the layover to avoid this incredibly lacking service and runaround. I don't fault the employees, it's the airline fault that they have zero systems in place for actual customer service.

### "a very smooth and planed process"
Flew this airlines from Minneapolis to San Diego in August. The staff at the MSP check in desk were very happy. We got to the gate and boarded in no time. A very smooth and planed process. Once in the air, the flight attendants came around twice during the flight. I just got water but they were selling other snack items and free beverages. Landed on time and got our baggage lickety split.

### "comfortable seats, pleasant cabin crew"
My first time flying with Sun Country from Minneapolis to Fort Myers and was very impressed. Comfortable seats, pleasant cabin crew and flight on time. But just one criticism. On my return flight, I was seated beside a a young nursing mother and her 6 week old baby girl and 2 year old son. I'm a 65 year old man. It may have been an oversight, but I think that this young mother should have had the row of seats to herself and children so that she could feed her baby with a bit of privacy. There were plenty of empty seats and I could have been moved to accommodate the young mother.

### "can't choose the seats"
Minnesota to Portland. I bought tickets together with my wife. When I flew with her to Minnesota we sat next to each other but when I returned from Minnesota to Portland i can't choose the seats next to each other, I was told that no seat available next to each other so I have to sit at front and my wife have to stt at the back. But when the I got inside of the airplane there were a lot of two seats together left - even the seat next to me was emty, nobody sat next to me at all.

### "great airline and good people"
This is my first time flying on sun country. It's a great airline and good people hampered by a bad website and phone service. When booking my flight, I tried to do it 4 times online and each time I got up to where you pick your seats and then got an "an error has occurred". I was trying to book while traveling so I ended up having to call and waited an hour to book on the phone, by that time the price had gone up 100 dollars. Booking frustrations aside, everyone involved in the travel process was friendly, helpful and courteous. The pilot came out at the start of the flight, school everyones hands and said hello to the whole plane. The flight attendants were kind as well. It's a low cost airline but good to fly. Hopefully they can get their website and phone service issues sorted out because I think they're hampering their success.

### "start calling and complaining?"
Phoenix to Minneapolis. My husband and I have flown Sun Country 5-6 times per year over the 2 1/2 years. Originally we used to book coach and call 24 hours prior to our flight to upgrade to first class. In the last year and half we started booking first class instead of waiting. Over the last year plus we have received consistently poor service from flight attendants. Normally I wouldn't say anything but it has gotten to a point that I think I want to start looking at different airlines. When did the flight attendants from MSP to Phoenix start disliking their jobs so much. I'm a person that says please and thank you. They barely smile in appreciation. If you don't like what you do find something different. The new rules are awful as well. Anyone can use first class bathrooms? I have been bumped into, they have touched my food, spilled my drink - need I go on. Anyone can use the overhead compartments? What's up with that. I have had bags dropped on me, I have had bare stomachs rub against me when they are reaching. What about the digi players. Last flight I was on flight attendant supposed to be passing them out stood up front flirting with guy flight attendant approximately 15 minutes. Then when she came back to collect them she collected first class first. I was on a 2.5hr flight and couldn't watch a 107 minute movie. I want Sun Country from a couple of years ago to come back. Will it help if I start calling and complaining?

### "indicate there is no window at 8A"
Minneapolis to Tampa. I've flown Sun Country Airlines several times, and have never had any problems with them. This last time I flew with them, I was flying with two other people, one of which had never flown. While confirming our seat selections, I chose row 8A-C. The seat selection screen says that 8A is a"bad seat" but doesn't say why. It appeared to be near the wing, but now over it, so I didn't see what the trouble was and I chose it. Turns out there's no window at 8a (there is one across the aisle at 8f though). Since one of my companions had never flown, it was important to me that she have a window. When I had the 24 hr notice to check in online, I did so, and also had the opportunity to change our seats, but the seat selection also indicated that it was a full flight, so there was nothing to move all three of us too. So, when we boarded, I noticed that rows four and five were completely open, and they stayed that way after the main door was closed. The fight attendants let us move up to one of the rows with windows, so it was fine. I would like to see them update their website to indicate there is no window at 8a. I will use sun country again, just not seat 8a.

### "will definitely fly again"
I had a pleasant experience flying Sun Country Airlines from Boston to Minneapolis. It was initially frustrating because our flight was delayed but the assistance and care shown by one of their employees turned my experience around 100%! It's rare that an airline employee stand out to me in such a way and I travel often and through airports around the world. Great hire Sun Country, will definitely fly again.

### "a super friendly staff"
We love Sun Country Airlines. The flights are very reasonable and they have a super friendly staff. We are very disappointed that they do not fly directly to Harlingen, Texas anymore. They should definitely bring that back and we would fly with them again!

### "reserved seat assignments changed"
Paid extra to reserve seats near the front of the plane for my young daughters - traveling alone for their first time. Reserved seats were confirmed, and, in fact a verbal guarantee from the Sun Country representative taking the preferred seating reservation, that our seat assignments wouldn't change, they were confirmed in the "system". And, that I could rest assured, knowing that my girls wouldn't have any trouble with their seat assignments. Well, either that Sun Country representative didn't know what she was talking about, or, she was playing the game of "opposite day" during our phone call. Not only did their reserved seat assignments get changed, but, I had to spend close to 2 hours on the phone with Sun Country customer service getting the run around about how something must have happened to their "system" and, that there was nothing that anyone at Sun Country could do to correct the situation - since, the seats had been newly "reserved" by someone else! Furthermore, the Sun Country customer service representative wouldn't give me any kind of guarantee that the same glitch in "their system" wouldn't happen again - when it came time for my daughters' return flight. I'll keep my fingers crossed, but, I'm not going to hold my breath.

### "great airline for the price"
It's was a great airline for the price and I would definitely fly with them again. I did have an issue with the a flight attendant with the way she snapped at me because I'm short and had a hard time getting my carry on in the overhead bin, because someone put theirs in sideways preventing me being able to get mine in. Also during my 1 hour layover we were at the gate within 45 mins but an attendant snapped at us because they were hoping to leave 20 minutes early because we wanted actual food before we hopped back on. The needs to be a better food selection besides cheeseburger, perhaps sandwiches. Besides those incidents it was a decent flight for the price.

### "inflexible rules about boarding times"
Sun Country Airlines is a terrible airline compared even to the other not so good airlines. Unreasonable and inflexible rules about boarding times, unpleasant staff, poor in-flight experience, disorganized communication. Spend the extra $20 and fly another airline - or you might not fly at all.

### "for a free flight it's pretty good"
Flew Sun Country Airlines on a casino junket, as like every other plane, seats are horrible. This is a 1hr 20 min flight so it's not that bad. Free drinks on flight to casino, purchase option on way back. Ground staff was wonderful at both locations. I gave it an 8 because the seats are horrible. All in all, for a free flight it's pretty good.

### Sun Country Airlines customer review
Not a great experience for a first time flyer of Sun Country Airlines. My carry on had to be checked after rows 4-9 then 19-25 were asked to board. I was in the exit row 13 and there's not enough room for carry-ons for 10 rows? Not only that, you skip the middle rows where some patrons pay additional money to sit more comfortably. Lastly, I was in seat 13A against the window, my arm rest was broken on the window side as was the passengers behind me. I will not be flying Sun Country again as this was my first and last shot because of ticket price. I fly about 4 times a month and it would've been nice to avoid checking my bag with only half the flight boarded. Time to rethink the logistics Sun Country.

### Sun Country Airlines customer review
Our flight was scheduled to leave DFW at 8:45am. We received a call around midnight the night before to let us know there was going to be a five hour delay. We arrived at the airport around noon and checked in at the gate. We finally started boarding around 2:15pm. The flight finally pulled from the gate at 3:15pm (six hours behind schedule). We arrived in Cancun around 5:30. At baggage claim we discovered that our bags (along with about ten other passengers) were not on our flight. We had to wait around until 7:30pm for the next flight to get our luggage. We finally arrived at our resort eight hours late.

### Sun Country Airlines customer review
Our travel experience was very good. Sun Country is not very recognized however our round trip from Fort Myers to Puerto Rico was very good. No delays and the flight attendants were friendly. Will travel with them again.

### Sun Country Airlines customer review
The flight(s) I took were a gift. So can't complain too much. The flights themselves were as routine as any other flight and airline I have traveled. However remember Sun Country by my appearances seems to be a "shoe string" operation. The only problem I had was my luggage on the outbound flight of this journey was pulled off the plane on a stop over in Lansing MI from MSP to DCA. Seems the baggage handlers in Lansing should pay more attention to their job. I unfortunately had to wait two full days for my luggage to be delivered.

### Sun Country Airlines customer review
How do you get "cut off" when you paid to upgrade to First Class? We were on our third beverage going to Jamaica from Minneapolis? The plane left around 11.30 am. That is what happened to me and the husband. Were we rowdy? no! We were watching a movie on the handheld when I asked for another beverage the flight attendant said that I was cut off because she could only serve 1 alcoholic drink and hour. We were 2.5 hours into the flight. I bet if we were "Paying" for our beverage it would of been okay. So Why did we upgrade to first class? Because we were on a much needed vacation? On the way back no worries would you like another etc.. Have you ever heard of that happening in First Class?

### Sun Country Airlines customer review
Flying from Fort Myers to Minneapolis on 3/13. Had reserved the tickets on 9/13/2014 at which time I also chose seats for the flight to Fort Myers and the flight back to Minneapolis. When we tried to print boarding passes at the Fort Myers airport we were told that we needed to pick new seats because the seats we originally chose in September 2014 were no longer available to us. We were told we could fly first class for $150+ additional charge (each of us and there were 3 of us traveling). We could also take the last row of the plane but I strongly opposed this due to a flight we were on in December when the rear seat smelled of rest room odor. Our last option was to take the exit row but pay an additional $25.00 to sit there. I strongly opposed this because we had chosen row 18 when we booked our flights. But Sun Country said that was only a choice on that day and the airline has every right to take away the seats. We had no choice we had to pay the $25.00/person to sit in the exit row. I also felt like the airline is collecting from customers to help the airline.

### Sun Country Airlines customer review
Flight 112 Laughlin to International Falls and then to Mpls Minnesota on Saturday Feb 21st 2015. Flight was delayed twice before bussing us to airport where we sat for another 8 hours and then to only be told at 2am that the crew had timed out. Sun Country must have known hours before that the crew would time out so that other arrangements could have been made. Totally unacceptable. We all understand weather problems but do not like to be lied to.

### Sun Country Airlines customer review
Extremely unprofessional: SFO-MSP Dec 22nd. Upon check-in I was told that the boarding time was shifted earlier than scheduled and I had to hurry up. After arriving at the gate I was informed that the incoming plane was a bit late. Then that due to fog which means SFO operating at decreased capacity the incoming plane had landed in San Jose. I assume they were stingy enough to carry just the minimum amount of fuel and therefore they could not afford to wait in air. Nobody seemed to have a clue how long it was going to be. 4 hours later the plane did arrive from San Jose but we were then told the crew had timed out and they had to bring in another crew from Minnesota to actually fly the plane. We departed 7.5 hours late after several fellow passengers had given up waiting. Select a more serious carrier!

### Sun Country Airlines customer review
I was impressed with my first trip on Sun Country Airlines. Flights were comfortable and staff pleasant. They even had food for sale at a reasonable price. Best of all when we had equipment problems in Palm Springs they held my connecting flight to Boston so I didn't have to spend the night in Minneapolis!

### Sun Country Airlines customer review
My wife and I took advantage of the non stop from Punta Cana to Dallas. All was fine however were very surprised when we asked for a blanket and were told there was a $5 charge. We were flying in first class first time I have been asked to pay for a blanket when traveling first class and more specifically first calls international.

### Sun Country Airlines customer review
Booked a flight on Sun Country for this summer from MI to Phoenix and rec'd a call recently that they have decided to cancel all flights to Phoenix for the month of July and that I could book another flight for June. Booking a flight in June does me no good since I don't leave on my trip until July. Absolutely ridiculous. They did not offer any compensation or try to book me on another airline for just up and cancelling the flight. I will not recommend Sun country to any of my family or friends.

### Sun Country Airlines customer review
I flew 1st class to MN from Phoenix AZ on 17th April. I thought due to the upcoming holiday that it might be might be hard for the stewardess to take care of all our needs. One lady in particular was wonderful during the flight. The flight was fast. I was given access to movies music games etc. My family was very impressed with this airline and its staff.

### Sun Country Airlines customer review
We flew Sun Country MSP-LAS and return in April 2014. Check in was easy and fast flight service was great. We booked an extra seat so we had a lot of room. For $100 each way could not beat the service. No incidents with flight. delayed maybe 15 minutes on way back due to late take off from Vegas. Other wise this is a decent airline with great price. I would most definitely recommend this airline to family and friends.

### Sun Country Airlines customer review
I booked our flights with them 2.5 months in advance Sun Country calls 6 weeks before the flight saying the flight is cancelled. No assistance from Sun Country at all for a new flight to match my schedule that I need. Sun Country's option - like the new flights we are offering or too bad. I then had to waste another hour searching for new flights at more cost.

### Sun Country Airlines customer review
Feb 19 Flight 265. Feb 24 Flight 268. Cheery forward-thinking staff made this an airline we will book again. All communicated their personal investment in the success of the company / recognition that customer service is directly related! Good legroom in economy class great price direct non-stop flight between Michigan and DC.

### Sun Country Airlines customer review
SFO-MSP and MSP-SFO and it was extremely good value for money. The price I paid for the flight was unbeatable at just a little over 100USD one way. It is the best budget airline I have flown. Check in staff in SFO weren't too friendly but got the job done. Flight attendants from SFO to MSP was so so did minimum of what they needed to do and left us alone. Considering it is a budget airline they do a drinks service. What impressed me was the number of check in counters that were opened when flying from MSP to SFO. They had 15 counters all manned. Lady at check in counter was very friendly. Got us through in no time. Flight attendants were wonderful. Made sure we had our drinks and comfortable. Provided useful travel information on California.

2/24/14 Boston to Minneapolis Flight # 252. Minn to Vegas Flight #107 Vegas to Minn 2/28/14 flight #102 Minn to Boston flight #253. Service was great. Had 2 friends that needed wheelchairs and never wanted for one. I would recommend. We even had a man that waited with us in Boston for our ride home that was a little late.

### Sun Country Airlines customer review
I flew from Seattle to Minneapolis to Chicago Midway this past December. All flights were late no announcements were made until 15 minutes before departure time. Leaving Midway we were told 15 minutes before the flight that they were waiting for the plane to land. 5 minutes later they told us that after circling the airport for 45 minutes the plane was turned away by Air Traffic Control due to bad weather. We were forced to stay another night in Chicago at our own expense. While we were waiting in line to get re-booked for the next flight Frontier landed and disembarked at the gate next to us. We asked why other airlines were still operating and the gate crew were very rude. I will never fly Sun Country again.

### Sun Country Airlines customer review
The trip from Boston to Las Vegas went without incident though I thought we would never stop driving around the runway. It took us 15 minutes to get to the runway to take off. The same thing happens when you land. Coming into Boston it took forever to get in position to land. The seats are horribly uncomfortable - no padding at all. The crew were attentive and nice. Sun Country does not give free snacks. $4 for a cheeseburger that is all bread $3 for boxes of candy.

### Sun Country Airlines customer review
MSP to LAS and the trip out was just fine. Good staff and pilot with no problems. The flight back was just a pain. Leaving Las Vegas we were not informed until we got to the tarmac we were number 25 of 30 planes in line to depart. The Captain said we would be in the air shortly. One hour later we took off. We then had an in flight emergency which the staff did very well with but the captain said nothing to anyone. We just had the fasten seatbelt the whole flight. We were over an hour late with no concern from the captain nor did anyone see the captain at all after we landed to check on the passenger who had to be rushed to hospital.

### Sun Country Airlines customer review
Sun Country is the worst nickel and dime airline I've flown in a long time. They charge you for every single bag. Now they won't even allow you to check-in ahead of time at all unless you agree to pay for each seat assignment. Plus they charge more to pay your bag fee at the airport. If you don't pay the fee for a seat assignment you can't purchase the discounted bag fee online. I'd rather pay a little more up front for a respectable airline than get hit with all these petty hidden fees on a ticket that was a little cheaper in the first place.

### Sun Country Airlines customer review
Wed July 31. Asked for aisle or window. Specifically asked if seat reclined as I was not feeling well. It did not and I could only be moved to middle seat after paying extra $25.00! Not very nice!

### Sun Country Airlines customer review
Not the cheapest fare for JFK-MSP-SFO but an interesting alternative the usual mainliners. Checked in online and took advantage of an upgrade to (domestic) first class for $290 mostly because I had to get into SF fast and thought this would make it easier to carry my large suitcase as hand luggage which worked fine although in practise it was a tiny bit too large to fit in the overhead locker but the kind flight attendant was able to stow it in a galley compartment which was helpful. Service inflight was charm personified and was served a very nice open sandwich on a tray with metal cutlery - better than domestic F class on other US carriers. Flights were obviously timed to connect in Minneapolis so 90 mins in the low-cost terminal was painless with excellent view of the busy air traffic out on the runways. Second leg MSP-SFO even more generous food this time a hot meal full of flavour. Slightly different configurations first 737-700 had no divider between F and Y second 737-700 had divider but different seats actually it was an ex-easyJet aircraft and still had the easyJet seat fabric which was a nice reminder of home. Landed on time (1705) and was off the plane quickly and thus made my appointment in the city at 1800 with time to spare (1750). Will definitely fly this charming airline again.

### Sun Country Airlines customer review
I fly on Sun Country on a somewhat regular basis and try to fly them whenever possible. On my latest flight to San Diego from MSP everything went very smoothly. The staff are very attentive and accommodating. The only things that are less than perfect was the seat condition which was a little worn and the in-flight entertainment is a Digi-Player instead of a seatback screen. Other than that they are my hometown airline.

### Sun Country Airlines customer review
Round trip from Minneapolis to Puerto Vallarta in February. I had no problems at all. Both flights left on time and arrived early. The crew southbound was friendlier than the one on my return but both were professional. An airline representative did test my carry-on for size by placing it in the "your bag must fit comfortably in this" contraption in PV. After I removed a large novel from an outer pocket it fit comfortably and I did not pay anything additional. I frequently see Sun Country employees look the other way when passengers carry on bags that are far larger than the regulations allow. My hunch is that those same passengers skate the rules so often it feels unfair when someone actually measures their bags. I like this airline and I will certainly fly them again.

### Sun Country Airlines customer review
I flew last July from DFW to MSP. Until now I've never flown First Class but since this airline's FC was fairly affordable I decided to give it a shot. I was very satisfied. I did not experience any problems on my flight. I would do it again. The food was good the seat was plenty big and the flight attendants were friendly.

### Sun Country Airlines customer review
Flew this past week from JFK to Las Vegas with a connection at MSP. Flights were on time or early and good and uneventful. Flight crews were average. Only free beverages if you wanted to eat you could have purchased pizza for $6.00 a burger for $5.00 or two hot dogs for $4.00. if the seats got any smaller they would have only been able to transport children under 12. I am a 4 ft 11 woman and I felt crammed in the entire time.

### Sun Country Airlines customer review
We were caught in the Sun Country's baggage extortion this last week. We sat with everyone for over an hour waiting for the gate to open. The gate personnel stood there with nothing to do. When they started boarding they seemingly randomly stopped people to measure their bag. Surprise almost none of the bags fit in the bin. Everyone whose bag was measured stated it was a bag that had fit on several flights. Our bag had been on over 20 flights including the flight into Minneapolis. There was no time to deal with it since we were already boarding. At our destination I counted 31 carryon bags in the carousel. I measured the overhead and closed it was 4 inches bigger than the measuring bin. Each bag at the gate was $25 each.

### Sun Country Airlines customer review
Flew once with them to DC had 1.5 hrs wait on a runway in Lansing which was hot muggy and enormously uncomfortable. Not so much as an "I'm sorry". 3 weeks later I flew again to Phoenix and I'm hit with a startling $100 in baggage fees because my 14-inch carry-on I took just 20 days earlier are no longer considered carry-ons by Sun Country. I was charged $30 for requesting 2 of my seat assignments online. Then another $80 to get my family's carry-ons back home again! I saved myself $20 by prepaying for my carry-ons online. I did not request seats online. If I had that would have been yet another $10 or $15 per seat depending on what I chose. $210 later. If my air fare had been really cheap I could perhaps justify some of these fees but my tickets were nothing special. I felt completely gouged on top of really mediocre service. Sun Country used to be my go-to airline but I will never fly this airline again.

### Sun Country Airlines customer review
Flew to Minneapolis from Fort Myers. Flight went smoothly. On return flight during boarding we were informed our pre-paid seats were assigned to someone else. We had received boarding passes at check-in with correct seats on pass but were denied boarding at gate. Seats were booked on 2 weeks before flight. Received new seat assignment at gate. No apologies for Sun Country's error nor have we received a credit for the pre-paid seats that we lost. Very poor customer service.

### Sun Country Airlines customer review
MSP-JFK. On time not full (I had a whole row to myself.) Smooth and great flight attendants. Sandwich was hot and tasty. Return flight JFK-MSP also on time no hassle check-in nice flight attendants and free hot dog was tasty. Anyway both flights clean cabin restroom good and clean on return flight. One complaint - had to pay more for an aisle or window seat even though Monday flight was practically empty.

### Sun Country Airlines customer review
JFK-MSP-LAX very impressed. Both flights on time and complimentary hot dog and two free beverages served. Staff polite and friendly. On the second leg I was surprised that the seats were the same grey and orange material as easyjet. Fortunately they've added more legroom!

### Sun Country Airlines customer review
If you want something cheap and don't mind having constant delays or+ not being informed about them until the last minute then Sun Country is the airline for you! I've had several flights with them and it's been delayed countless of times. I fly enough to know that delays are inevitable and I do not blame them for this. However the problem is the lack of communication in their part to inform passengers about these delays. With any other airline if there is a delay all I have to do is wait a bit later in my home or office before heading out to the airport. But do not expect the same from them. Passengers find out about about these delays 30 minutes before the flight is supposed to board. The reason I am writing this unfavorable review is because every time the plane had never left Atlanta and/or another location that is literally 3-4 hours away. That means that while the plane has been sitting somewhere for 2 hours we are told about it 1 hour later and according to them it is only delayed for an hour - which I'll find out later on when they announce another flight delay. I will be paying a couple bucks more from now on to fly with a more professional airline.

### Sun Country Airlines customer review
Flew Minneapolis to San Fran. Issues included being unable to check-in online the breakfast sandwich we received was awful. We were targeted by the gate agent who said our carry-on bags were too large. Regardless they made us check-in one of our carry-ons even though there was plenty of overhead room onboard and we could have fit the bag. They have lost my business. I will not take this airline again.

Red Eye from SFO to Boston. Arrived 15 hrs late due to mechanical issues that forced us to land in Wyoming on the way from SFO. We were taken off the plane but were not kept well informed customer service did not know what was going on. At one point the TSA agent needed to make an announcement for the pilot and crew while in Wyoming. All in all I was not very satisfied with my trip.

### Sun Country Airlines customer review
Just did the return London-Minneapolis/St.Paul flight. Excellent on the ground and in air service on both the outbound and return leg. Technical stop in Gander both directions was excellent-no need to take passport/boarding card - it's simply in and out or you can stay on board if you prefer. Gander had a duty free/gift store and a cafe open for us arriving there's also a smoker's lounge if you need it. Hot meal and light meal service were excellent and free. The rentable digiEplayer service excellent and good value for the $6 you pay. Plenty of legroom and comfortable. The flight attendants were exceptional and very attentive. My reservations about crossing the Atlantic on a B737 are gone. Ground staff did not charge me for an aisle seat or my luggage being slightly over limit either. Flight was on time both directions and Minneapolis/St.Paul Terminal 2 is an excellent facility.

Just completed the first half of a RT Seattle-Boston flight. On time arrival courteous crew and free hot dogs and drink refills were all appreciated. Plus it was the least expensive flight available and the route thru Minn/St Paul is more direct than any other one-stop flyer.

SEA-BOS round-trip flight one stop in MSP both times. I was seated in a 737-800 with no seat changes. The crew came around 5-6 times on the flight from MSP-SEA when it was only a 5hr flight. On every trip the plane was early to arrive by 10-15 mins. I was very impressed that every plane was on time for take off and arrival. Many people complain about the $25 checking fee for bags and I have to say that every airline has a checking fee whether hidden in the ticket price or not. I was very glad that Sun Country is a smaller airline because the flights weren't incredibly crowded. I witnessed a heavier man asking for a seat change due to increase his comfort and the attendants gladly moved him to a different seat on the plane. On my flight from BOS-MSP there was an incident where they double booked 2 seats but otherwise it was pretty smooth.

Minneapolis to Las Vegas. When checking in on-line be aware of the fees tacked on if you want to sit next to your spouse or traveling companion. You can possibly avoid this if you go to the ticketing booth. Boarding procedure at Minneapolis is time consuming. After calling for first class medical family and no carry on the rest of the plane boards similar to cattle being driven into a chute. Las Vegas boards their planes back to front (first-class medical family and no carry - on go first in that order) and because of this procedure we enjoyed 15 minutes ahead of published flight time. The staff were fantastic. Excellent service is what sets this airline apart from all the other airlines in Minneapolis. This company has sadly fallen in line with other airlines with regards to pricing and to the bottom line of running an airline. After sending two e-mails and talking to a customer representative who seemed indifferent to the entire process can honestly say that we will not fly with this airline in the future.

MSP-LAS ten times in the past five years. Every flight has been great staff friendly and efficient. I don't care for the checked baggage fees but that's unfortunately become the norm for just about every airline and I do miss the free cheeseburgers but we've still been very happy with their service and planes.

Minneapolis to San Francisco travelling with my wife and 8 month old son. The staff at the check-in counter very polite and helpful suggested changes to my overweight bags so that I wouldn't be charged extra for them (saved me USD $75) - they were very patient while I was re- arranging my bags. Cabin crew was courteous and cheerful. Seeing that I had an infant they offered to seat me in one of the empty rows so that I could get the extra seat for all the childs stuff (diaper bag food etc.)

LAX to Minneapolis. This is my first time of flying Sun Country. My daughter and I had a connecting flight. From Manila to LAX we flew Philippines Airlines and from LAX to MSP Sun Country. I was charged $25.00 for each of my checked in baggage. I never had to do this with other airlines. I have fllown NW American Delta etc. for my connecting flight and did not have to pay for my checked in baggage. I explained to the Customer Service Rep that this is my connecting flight but she insisted that I still have to pay because the plane I took for my international flight was not Sun Country. No matter how I explained it I still paid for all my checked in baggage. To make matter worse my daughter and I were separated when they assigned seats. I asked that we sit together because she is a minor but I was told by the CSR they can't do that for me and that I just have to wait to see if there are people who would be willing to switch once we get in the plane. No one was willing so my daughter and I were apart. I did not like the CSR. As I was trying to explain the situation she was smirking and it was very insulting. My daughter mentioned this to me later that she also noticed it. Very rude. I hope I don't have to fly Sun Country again.

### Sun Country Airlines customer review
While attempting to check in the night before departure we learned that the airline sometime earlier had canceled our non-stop flight and switched us to a stop-over flight that left 45 minutes earlier (requiring a much earlier wake up) and was an hour and a half longer. We got no email advising us of this change. Traveling with small children the change made for an significant inconvenience. Had we known we would have purchased non-stop tickets with a different airline for the same price. The airline offered to send us vouchers for $50 in travel at a later date but that assumes we would fly with them again. Very disappointed.

MSP to RSW and back. Exceptional service newer aircraft and on time performance makes this Minneapolis based carrier my favorite way to travel to Ft Myers and back. First class service is second to none with attentive and smiling attendants and the service in coach is also above average than what you get with legacy carriers. Both flights on board 737-800 a pleasure to fly on clean and well maintained aircraft.

### Sun Country Airlines customer review
We have flown Sun Country many times. The staff onboard are extremely helpful and polite. We have flown both first-class and coach and have been treated very well in both locations. The onboard food has been very pleasant. We far prefer Sun Country to Northwest which is the "big" local carrier. We have been treated rudely on NW and the service was just not up to the standard that Sun Country has set. We'll continue to fly Sun Country whenever possible. We were a bit nervous after the financial issues of Tom Petters (who ran the parent company that owned quite a bit of the airline) that our flight this spring might be cancelled or affected somehow by the trouble. However as it turned out we were every bit as pleased as always.

Support this MSP based small airline. Although in Chapter 11 they are operating a full timetable.. Their cabin crews even though they are currently only receiving 70% of their pay (due to the problems of parent company) could teach cabin crews of all of the legacy carriers serious lessons in courtesy and pleasantness. Flight crews do their bit keeping flight information flowing from the flight deck. All in all the sort of experience that takes me back some years when the legacy carriers appreciated my business and tried to get me as a regular customer. On my most recent flight we were 25 minutes late leaving arrived 10 minutes late but I was out of the aircraft in my car and away from the terminal within 10 minutes. Their aircraft are modern clean and as comfortable as you get theses days and their fares are very competitive. During a nearly three hour flight the cabin crew came around twice after the normal drinks round to enquire if passengers needed anything. It didn't appear that there was any "hiding in the galley".

MSP-RSW return. Genuine concern and commitment to passenger satisfaction and overall customer service is something unheard of today this airline does it better than most carriers. Comfortable flights left and arrived on time on modern clean Boeing 737-800 with periodic updates from cockpit on flight progress. Well done Sun Country I hope reps from the majors are reading this they ought to take a page or two out this book for a change!

### Sun Country Airlines customer review
Nice terminal relatively quiet and friendly fast check-in clean leather seats (a bit snug but unless you're in first class what airline isn't?). Inflight HOT sandwiches (and cookie) with leftovers cheerfully handed out by flight attendants. Flight on schedule but equally important to me are the attitude and little things and they were tops. I was very impressed by the honesty and efficiency with which they handled the return of my husband's I-POD (left in the magazine rack at his seat on the plane). I reported it lost from home the next day and within an hour I got a call letting me know they had it and where to pick it up. Great catch by the attendant and great customer service by the office people who were friendly and helpful. The overall appearance is that the people who work for Sun Country are happy to be there. I highly recommend Sun Country Airlines. Keep up the good work.

MSP-Puerto Vallarta. From the moment we checked in at MSP/HHH throughout the flight to PV and returning to MSP a week later we had a great experience with Sun Country Airlines. Flight attendants were consistently friendly on both flights. We have flown Sun Country many many times and will continue to do so! I look forward to our next trip and flying with Sun Country Airlines!

### Sun Country Airlines customer review
MSP HHH to Las Vegas was perfect - departing and arriving on time. The return flight that was scheduled to arrive at MPLS at 1:00 PM on January 28th; however it 12 hours late arriving at 1:00 AM on the 29th. Fortunately I have family to spend time with away from the airport - some passengers were at the airport 14 hours! I initially arrived at the airport at 6 AM to check my luggage and then returned again 4 hours before actual departure - because it wasn't certain when the plane would arrive from MPLS to unload/reload. What made the passengers most angry and frustrated was the fact there were no SunCountry agents at the desk. The delays were not posted on the electronic posting so no one had a clue what was going on. One passenger finally called Minneapolis Reservations and requested that an agent come to the desk in Las Vegas and update passengers as to what was going on - this didn't happen until 1 hour prior to boarding. Positive side: Attendants were wonderful; food was hot generous and appreciated.

I flew sun country to SAN from MSP and back and found SY to be the perfect airline for me. If they only had a Frequent Flier program and flew to PHL I would fly them all the time. When you check-in at SAN you have to use the DL check-in position and DL gates. You arrive at gate 38 and depart gate 36 in terminal 2. Great Airline!

### Sun Country Airlines customer review
My husband and I flew Sun Country 12-25-06. Early into the flight an announce-ment was made that there was a CAT loose! We were all asked to look under our seats for the cat. The stewardess and the owner (a young girl) were crawling around in the aisle calling "here kitty". I was very upset as my husband is extremely allergic to cats usually breaking out in hives and having difficulty breathing. The cat was found under his seat but luckily he was in the restroom at the time. I had no idea cats were allowed on the plane! The stewards were quite casual about the whole thing only that "yes cats were allowed but hadt o be kept in their cage/container at all times. My questions -- was the owner fined for letting the thing out ? What steps would have been taken had my husband had an attack? Should the other passengers been notified that a cat would be on board?

Great customer service from the moment you check-in until the time you leave. Flight Attendants are always friendly helpful and smiling. They serve hot sandwiches and cookies on every Flight. Planes are new clean and have leather seats. Wonderful experiences with sending my children as unaccompanied minors as well. The kids were boarded last and walked by the Gate Agents to the Flight Attendants and shown to their seats. The kids thought the Flight Attendants were very nice. When they got on the Flight Attendants introduced themselves helped them with their luggage explained where the restrooms were and got them anything they needed. They were also seated with the other unaccompanied minors; and were able to talk and share coloring books and toys. The were taken off after all the other passengers got off and signed over by the Flight Attendants themselves. Very well done for only $50 each way. Great service at a low cost. Great little airline!

LAX-MSP-LAX. My wife and I were very pleased with our flights. Friendly and helpful crew comfortable 737-800 all-in all found Sun Country better than Northwest for LA-MSP. travel. Only downside is red eye only but will use again.

### Sun Country Airlines customer review
I just finished my 5th. business trip within 3 months using Sun Country. I fly with a medical Neb for Asthma and every time the bag was pulled for a check "Good going Sun Country" makes the passenger feel safer that they are doing their job. Even with some delays they are far superior to the "other" scheduled airlines I have flown on. A pleasant customer service smile goes a long way. Keep up the good work.

### Sun Country Airlines customer review
Had to opportunity to fly Sun Country for the first time and was very satisfied with the airline. Sun Country provides audio entertainment with either your own L/R adapter and your headphones or they will provide you one for $1. Some services cost extra but are reasonable. Costs: Can of beer (Miller or Bud) $3 Harder drinks (Like Long Island Ice Tea) $5 Traveler pillow and blanket (Yours to keep) $5. Sun Country is one of the best when it comes to the budget airlines much better then Ted or Air Tran and the service was very friendly. The only problems were the lack of staff at MCO and how the tickets and boarding made you think you were flying Delta. Also the audio entertainment (All 8 channels) repeats every hour. Otherwise the staff helpful and friendly and flight attendants are first rate.

### Sun Country Airlines customer review
We have had occasion to fly Sun Country three times in the last year to three different destinations and home again. Each time has been a very pleasant experience. We are particularly impressed with the airport personnel at the Humphrey Terminal who are on hand to point us in the right direction and to answer questions always with a friendly attitude. We experienced only one delay -- brought about by weather conditions. Many thanks Sun Country for being there!

### Sun Country Airlines customer review
SFO-MSP-SFO : a very positive experience. The crew is attentive without being pushy and the value for money is extraordinary. Whenever the seat belt sign comes on there is a booming male recorded voice that makes James Mason's impressions of God seem second class. Since both flights were essentially overnights this could be toned down a bit. Also very few pillows for the flight timings. But these are very minor complaints and I will continue to use them when possible.

### Sun Country Airlines customer review
12/05. First time we flew Sun Country. Big disappointment. 45 minute delay outbound. 3 hour delay return flight. Captain used intercom to apologize for more then bumpy ride. Seating crammed more than normal coach. Counter clerk auctioning off unused 1st class seats on intercom in waiting area. Should be renamed "Slick" airlines.

Minnepaolis to Seattle in December 2005. Direct flights on time friendly service great hot meals and the cheapest flight out there at only $200/ticket.

### Sun Country Airlines customer review
Flew Sun Country from Minneapolis to Las Vegas in October 2005 and it was a great flight both directions. The flights left and arrived right on time. The staff was friendly and the electronic check-in was very convenient. I was very pleased with the meals served on both flights and I would absolutely rate Sun Country much higher in every category than Northwest.

### Sun Country Airlines customer review
I have flown with Sun Country 4 or 5 time in the last year and a half and have found everything to be 100% as promised and expected. My flights could not have been more trouble free and at all times have found the flight attendants to be very helpful and friendly.

### Sun Country Airlines customer review
I have no complaints about the booking the flight  or inflight service. I have been using Sun Country for several years during visits to the US. The only difficulty is check in at Delta Terminal at JFK The procedure changes periodically. The lines one is to follow or the exact methodology of check-in are unclear and poorly marked. All in all a minor but annoying complaint.

### Sun Country Airlines customer review
Booked a Sun Country flight for child 13 years of age - which carries an additional charge of $100 ($50 each way) for an unaccompanied minor. Lots of paperwork! List who is picking her up -- they must have a photo ID --- and so on. Flying daughter from Orlando to Minneapolis ... into and out of the Hubert Humphrey terminal. Return flight - was not satisfactory -- and Sun Country does not have signed paper - and daughter notes that no one helped her find seat no one helped with carry on - and they left her to find her way off of the plane - and to her father -- who saw no one in attendance - and Sun Country does not have anything signed saying the designated person picked her up. So why the charge? Thank goodness it was a direct flight - and who monitors these things. What is the airlines responsibility regarding unaccompanied minors? The job was right on the flight out -- but they really blew it on the return flight ... forget about luggage and carry ons -- this was the most precious cargo they had on the plane (to me). Did they fumble the ball? No - worse they didn't even know where the game was being played. And evidently couldn't find the ball if it was sitting right in front of them. Shame on Sun Country.

My wife and I flew to Cancun from MSP on April 10th and returned on April 15th 2005. Flight was on time going to and was 20 minutes late on the return trip only because of the back-up in Cancun. This was the first flight for my wife on a commercial arline and I personally do not like to fly but Sun Country changed our views on flying. Staff was very professional and had a smile for you without even trying. My wife really enjoyed her first flight I still do not like to fly but when we take our next vacation guess what Sun Country will be the first choice. We were totally impressed with you! Thank you for helping make our vacation a most memorable one!! Keep up the great effort!

### Sun Country Airlines customer review
I have enjoyed flying Sun Country each time I have flown to Minneapolis.! Flight times are good and rarely delayed service great and the sandwich is a nice touch! I recommend Sun Country highly and only wish they had more flights. Due to the low cost I can travel to visit my grandchildren more often whenever I have a 3 day weekend!

### Sun Country Airlines customer review
I would like to share our opinion on Suncountry's methods of changing flight times. We had booked a flight in early in Sept for travel in Jan from MPS to Cozumel. Times were great - then they changed it on Nov 5 - and now they changed it again. We arrive in Cozumel much later Saturday so we feel SunCountry has cheated us out of 1 vacation day. Also we leave very late the following Saturday. Check out is 12pm and our fight leaves at 8pm so this means we will have pay for 1/2 day stay at the hotel and we will not get into MPS till 1230am Sunday. I don't not think that this is a fair system. We agreed on the time and it worked for our schedules now Suncountry ahs messed things up!! We have never had this happen before! !

### Sun Country Airlines customer review
SFO-MSP-SFO Nov. 18-24. Once again I was pleasantly surprised by the flights. The crews were friendly personable and interested in interaction with passengers. The flight to MSP was on a Transavia 737 with seating pitch designed by Atilla the Hun but I had 3 seats so was able to stretch sideways. I continue to be favorably impressed - especially given the fare.

### Sun Country Airlines customer review
MSP-SFO. Flight worked perfectly with schedule requirements and was only $100 as opposed to much more on NW. MSP signage for Humphrey Terminal leaves something to be desired but the overall flight experience was equal to any on a legacy carrier but perhaps with a better attitude. This was my third flight with Sun Country and I have no complaints.
