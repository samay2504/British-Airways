### "43 euros each to check our carry-on"
Discount airline that ends up full price after all the extra charges. Rude, unprofessional staff. Unreliable flights. Uncomfortable seats. Food is expensive and lousy. You need to pay to sit next to your spouse. We were charged 43 euros each to check our carry-on which they claimed was above their limit. We’d checked it for free many times on many airlines because it’s only a small carry on. Uncaring and rude staff. We arrived at counter 3 hours before flight and were told checkin starts at 2 hours. Wasted an hour and returned to a huge lineup. Checkin clerk got in a big fight with customer in front of us. Perhaps took it out on us. Arrived at gate and saw flight delayed by 90 minutes when we had a 100 minute connection. In the end flight was 2.5 hours kate. Next flight was waiting for us and many other connecting passengers. Passengers had boarded on time and waited on plane for 90 minutes for us. Crew refused them water with excuse of limited supply. Crew made an announcement blaming connecting passengers for delay.

### "Absolutely disgusting treatment"
My review concerns not the airplane (though l found food remains in my assigned seat) but the luggage loading process. On 26-02-24 it was a particularly ugly day in Paris and the loading crew didn't bother to cover the luggage carts carrying luggage to the plane with a tarp or plastic covering as is usually done everywhere in the world across all airports, instead leaving it to get soaked senseless before loading it, causing water to get through into the luggage and cause many items to get wet, among them books, comic books and carton boxes with toys such as Lego or carton boxes with food items. Upon sending a claim to CSA l was told that it is MY problem and that no visible damage has been recognized despite me sending in not only photos of the damage (the CSA claim site allows only two photos in total) but also of the event happening, of which l have both photos and videos. Absolutely disgusting treatment of a frequent flyer customer of the CSA Plus program, if not of all customers in general.

### "I'm being had and that's how it is"
This airline is an absolute shame in every way. To flee at all costs. Tickets ordered in 2019 for a flight in 2020. Tickets canceled due to COVID but refusal of reimbursement by the company which sends (without any explanation and without my agreement) vouchers directly following the cancellation emails. A year later, at my request, these vouchers (which are only valid for 1 year) are extended a second time because the company refuses reimbursement (although promised at the end of the validity date) on the pretext that they are in a statute of protection of the firms in bankruptcy and that to obtain a refunding I would have to introduce a procedure near a Czech court! Anyway it's too late because I'm out of time. All this happens via email and with incredible response times (when they dare answer because you have to systematically relaunch them). You don't have to be in a hurry with them. We are now at the end of validity of these second vouchers and I realize that Brussels is no longer even offered as a possible airport (nor any other in Belgium). I contact them directly by phone (in English, which they don't speak very well by the way) and they explain to me that the vouchers will expire in Oct 2022, that I just have to board at another airport that they serve, that they will not reimburse the vouchers and that they will not extend them either. Despite my request, my contact explains to me that no one else within the company can't give me more info. In summary, I'm being had and that's how it is. Two words come to mind: thieves and scampers!

### "Do not book flights with them"
My ticket was cancelled by CSA more than a month ago and I still can't get money back for that. On my requests they answer, that I need to wait. When I ask - how long to wait? - no answer! On top of that, my two previous flights were delayed for more than 24 hours with no reasons. Do not book flights with them.

### "flight attendants were not very friendly"
Flight No. OK723 Departure 8.25pm Late departure, Aircraft (Turboprob) not the youngest, but ok. The flight attendants were not very friendly, like they would be happy to have end of work after this flight. I pressed the service button (wanted to ask if there is regular cabin service) and nothing happened. They switched on the full light when preparing F&B service but forgot to switch off afterwards. When collecting the waste, they ignored me several times. All in all okay, scarce.

### "could have been much better"
Prague to Amsterdam. Flight could have been much better. Seat was old, dirty and uncomfortable. Paying for Business class with LCC service. Cabin Crew were okay. Food on board tasted good. Boarding started 10 minutes before departure. No in-flight entertainment. To call it "business class" is a joke. This airline is in the same level with Wizz/Ryanair except with high prices and poor service. Not worth the upgrade to business!

### "a trick to scam users"
Prague to Brussels. When traveling with my luggage and a small laptop bag, they tried to charge me 45€ and force me to put one of them in the hold. They stated that this policy is clearly mentioned when you but the flight but I disagree. It was not clear and it's completely unfair. The laptop bag fits under the seat so, it's not a matter of space but a trick to scam users. The ironic part is that I was able to put my laptop bag inside the luggage and they didn't have problems me carrying my laptop and a book inside the plane. When I bought the ticket, another Airline (Brussels Airlines) had same prices on the same route and almost identical schedules. It's clear which airline I will fly with next time.

### "started with an hour delay"
Budapest to Paris via Prague with CSA Czech Airlines. The flight started with an hour delay. Before landing in Prague I Was asking about my luggage, if it will arrive on time to the next airplane! Of course sir bla bla - it did not arrive! Very uncomfortable feeling to travel without luggage!

### "for the price I paid I was more than happy"
Surprisingly smooth flight on board Czech Airlines, check-in was smooth and flight departed on time from Paris and as I had Plus fare, they did not bother me about my cabin bag and backpack during boarding. On board offer was OK and prices were low - the beer which I ordered was cold which is perfect. They also offered a water after the paid service so for the price I paid I was more than happy. Flight arrived 15 minutes early, only downside of the trip was the long wait for the bags in Prague.

### "Staff was nice and friendly"
Prague to Copenhagen. Flight was operated by Czech Airlines A319 (reg. OK-MEL), not with lowcost Smartwings 737, like almost all other CSA flights. Departure was delayed only about 10 minutes, we arrived on time. Staff was nice and friendly. Ordered food was so expensive (260CZK), but delicious. Aircraft was clean and seats were comfortable.

### "delayed as usual for 2 hrs"
Prague to Paris. Flight with CSA operated by Smartwings was delayed as usual for 2 hrs. The boarding process was pure mess because of too many cabin bags  which delayed us even more. The staff on airplane was nice, welcoming and apologetic for the delay. I prepaid the gourmet meal which was outstanding for the price both in quality and quantity. There was in-flight app with entertainment working however I did not try it. If we were not delayed it would be a great flight.

### "airline ruined this country’s great experience"
Amsterdam to Prague. I’ve flown all over the world and this is by far the worst airline I have ever flown. Not only was the flight delayed nearly an hour with no explanation. Also when boarding we were shuffled out ide to stand in the cold while waiting to board. Czech is such a beautiful place but this country needs to invest in or rehire their entire airlines staff. As an American I have to say this airline ruined this country’s great experience. This airline was beyond disorganized and completely unprofessional. There were multiple other issues when landing that I will not go into on here. When I say never, I mean I will never fly on this airline again. Just save yourself the headache and fly elsewhere.

### "I was very pleasantly surprised"
Prague to Rome. I didn't expect a lot when booking a flight with Czech Airlines but I was very pleasantly surprised. The plane was a Smartwings one, the interior wasn't new, but was clean and working well. The flight was on time, there was also an inflight wifi, which worked well. Crew was polite, nice and attentive, only water was given for free, but that's normal nowadays. However, Czech Airlines offer so called "Gourmet menu" for 14€, which must be purchased online at least one day before take-off. For that 14€ you get a tasty hot meal served on porcelain, dessert, salad, fresh buns with butter and three drinks including wine/beer and hot drinks, served in glass or porcelain cups. All that with maximum willingness and professionalism. To conclude, give this airline with almost 100 years of tradition a chance. They struggled in recent past, but now they are a nice option for flying to Prague (or via Prague) again.

### "below-average low cost carrier"
Barcelona to Prague. I used to be a Gold member of OK Plus for more than 10 years, but as soon as it was bought by Travel Service and everything went down (quality, service etc. ), I stopped using CSA completely. I tried them after quite a long time on single journey from BCN to PRG and will not fly again. They try to be seen as regular airline, in reality this is below-average low cost carrier. I have even paid for upgrade to C class - food terrible, service terrible, being sat in 2nd row the legroom space close to zero. On a positive note, we were not delayed, apart from that nothing to write home about.

### "low-cost airline aircraft"
Prague to Keflavik. Experience of the worst low-cost airline under the price of the traditional airline, no online booking manager, no fully usable mobile app, call-centre operators without knowledge, extra-legroom seats with space of basic ones, booking changes they do without letting you know. This airline is facing as a traditional and modern one. But reality becomes when I saw the type of aircraft, I realize, that I will fly with low-cost airline aircraft. I believed that for price 210€ I'll get the full experience of the traditional airline. I prepaid food and seat in the first row. About one week later, when I wanted to add baggage, my booking manager site was empty (no option to add more services). So I called the customer centre and I got information that this is happening often and it's not possible to fix my booking manager and I have to manage everything via call centre (the mobile app is useless, you can't manage anything there - you only see information about the flight). Then the operator also told me that my seat (i paid for the first row) was changed because of changing aircraft. I wasn't noticed before via mail or SMS, that this happened. Not for least, she also told me, that this aircraft doesn't have"kitchen, so it's not possible to have warm food there, which I paid for. So I ask for another baggage and refund for food. One week later I tried to have another call and ask about my issue. Another operator told me, that it is possible to have warm food on this flight. I was totally disappointed, but at the and I order a paid for the food again with hope, that second operator knows what she speaks about. During boarding, I came to the oldest plane I can imagine from the most low-cost airline Smartwings. Legroom was tiny as in other B737, but my seat was priced as the extra-legroom seat. The only one thing I was fine with, was the food menu for 15€.

### "poor quality 2-star low-cost"
Had a single ticket issued by KLM from Prague to Moscow via Amsterdam. I have SkyTeam Elite Plus status. Flight from Prague has been codeshare with CSA but operated by Smartwings. Much to my surprise, CSA rejected to check my luggage through to the final destination, saying that they do not have the respective arrangement with KLM. Both companies are SkyTeam members and my flight has been presented as KLM flight. Consequently, I have been forced to pick up my luggage in Amsterdam, leave the terminal, check-in again, pass security and passport control. Rather than having my planned meeting in Amsterdam, I had to deal with my luggage. I was checking with KLM and they confirmed, that there is indeed no agreement between these two companies and CSA is right. And it is despite the fact, that flight has been marketed and sold as KLM flight. Another problem is, that you purchase a ticket with 4-star airlines to end up with poor quality 2-star low-cost, which does not even let you choose your seat for free (despite my Elite Plus status). Therefore, be aware of the codeshare. You might be paying for one service and get something very different.

### "Lame experience overall"
Paris CDG to Prague. Late In both directions. No warning, no one says anything, the plane was already supposed to have left when they started boarding. No apologies no explanations. No refreshments unless you pay for them. Lame experience overall.

### "Avoid if you can"
Prague to Gatwick. I will strongly recommend not to use this airline, I went with them to Prague and back. Going in to Prague they told me there is not enough space for me to fly as they oversold the tickets and they lost several passengers bags. Luckily someone didn’t show up so I could fly. I have paid and booked the flight weeks before. On the way back flight was delayed, no explanation to what why etc, I have lost my connection home and staff said “it’s a shame” no sorry etc. Avoid if you can.

### "Real disappointment"
Flying OK619 from Amsterdam to Prague on October 3rd. Flight operated by Smartwings and late as usual. Boarding has been chaotic, service a board amateurish. Passengers were siting for quite a long time in the plane after "boarding completed" without a word of explanation as to why and what might be the departure time. The same in Prague. The plane was sitting on the apron, passengers waiting and no explanation provided. Would that be that difficult to explain, that we are waiting for the bus? Very poor service. One feels as a cargo. Plus you have CSA ticket but flight is actually operated by Smartwings which is a low end lowcoster. Real disappointment, nothing was working right.

### "the crew very professional and friendly"
The flight was operated by Smart Wings and it was a surprisingly good experience. I have not flown Czech Airlines for many years and now, after booking the flight and after reading the reviews, I got really scared. But it was a very pleasant surprise. I booked the economy flex ticket, so I got a little ciabatta, water, coffee and a biscuit. Additionally I bought a beer on board (some 2,5 EUR). I got an emergency exit seat which was another nice suprise. The flight was on time, the crew very professional and friendly (water offered to everyone, several times during the flight checked if anyone needs anything). Overall a very good experience. After flying for many years only with Lufthansa group, I would not say that Czech Airlines are worse. Even on the way to St. Petersburg, my experience was pretty much the same. The only difference was that I did not get the emergency exit seats and I have to say that the legroom in the normal seats is very limited.

### "the plane was a bit dated"
Barcelona to Prague with CSA Czech Airlines. The flight went smoothly, with a lot of information provided at all times. However, there is very little room between rows and the plane was a bit dated.

### "Not enough leg space"
Amsterdam to Prague. Took my cabin luggage. Was plenty of room in the cabin still. Very annoying. Not enough leg space for 190cm person, which is not tall in. My friend who is over 200cm had it even worse.

### "took my cabin luggage"
Prague to Hamburg. Does not matter that the luggage compartments were free, the Gate Personnel took my cabin luggage. It does not matter that my luggage met all the requirements for cabin luggage, declared and recorded in the Electronic Ticket.

### "A horrible experience"
Moscow to Prague. This was a very poor experience. Initially, I changed my ticket after buying one with baggage extra. Then I changed the date. The system did not took my baggage, although I emailed the company twice and they assured me this was ok. I had to pay again for the baggage. The departure was delayed from 5:05 to 5:45 to 6:30 and still counting. Missing first night events in Prague due to this flight. A horrible experience.

### "not really an on-line check-in"
Copenhagen to Prague. The airline is offering on-line check-in which is not really an on-line check-in as you have to get your ticket at the baggage counter. This is a big step back as I have travelled a couple of times with this airlines the same route (Copenhagen to Prague) and before August it was possible to save your ticket to your phone wallet or print it at home. Moreover, the staff is rude and always has troubles with some people's cabin baggage even though the cabin storage room is completely empty.

### "Check in staff extremely rude"
Frankfurt to Prague. Check in staff at the airport was extremely rude, shouting, talking over, having conversations, passing staff while holding my Id in her hand. There are no standards.

### "worst company I've  dealt with"
Copenhagen to Prague. CSA Czech Airlines is the worst company I've ever dealt with. 2 of 3 flights I experienced with this carrier were connected with some inconvenience - delayed flight,  misinforming help desk, mean behaviour e-shop that changes prices when you press 'pay'. I can recommend just one thing: don't fly with them even if it means to pay a little more. The stress you might undergo is not worthy of the possible saving.

### "Delayed every single time"
Beirut to Prague via Amsterdam with CSA Czech Airlines. Delayed every single time flown, missed connecting flight due to airline delay. Check online flight times for record of consistent delays with this incompetent airlines.

### "will avoid them in the future"
Brussels to Prague. Czech Airlines are already one of the worst airlines I have ever chosen. When I first tried to check in - even though they claim you should be able to do it 36 hours prior to your flight - the system simply would not recognise my details. Later it did, but I recklessly changed my seat and it turns out that is against payment. Fun fact: once you change your seat even your original seat becomes payable, should you want to change it back. Prices are ridiculously high, I mean, EUR15 for a meal!? I am absolutely livid and will avoid them in the future at any rate.

### "disappointing low-cost experience"
Paris to Prague. Very disappointing low-cost experience with Czech Airlines. - Flight is sold online as operated by CSA Czech Airlines. Reservation confirmation email and Boarding Pass only mention that this is a CSA Czech Airlines flight. Flight is however operated by low-cost sister company Smartwings with no notice whatsoever until you see the aircraft pull at the gate. This may characterize as a breach of French airline regulations which state that the passenger must be informed ahead of the flight of the name of the Operating Airline. From a commercial perspective this is also quite misleading for the passenger to make an informed choice: I booked on a mainstream national airline and ended up flying a LCC with no prior notice whatsoever. - Check-in process in airport is quite messy: SkyPriority sign hard to find and long unorganized queues in a very small check-in area making it difficult to even reach the SkyPriority line - Lounge in CDG T2D that CSA Czech Airlines contracts with is extremely sub-par. Food choice is limited to a couple of chips, cold snacks and cheese and is not restocked regularly, drinks not properly refrigerated, floor is dirty and sticky when you walk on it, tables and chairs extremely worn out and shaky, lounge is located in a mezzanine between airside and landside in CDG T2D and very noisy as you hear all sounds of the passenger terminal around. - Flight late with no apologies or explanation and no updated boarding time communicated in airport - Aircraft operated by Smartwings is an old B737 with extremely cramped (LCC) seat configuration, bulky old seats with poor padding and little leg-space.

### "Late every time we use them"
Birmingham to Prague. Shockingly bad. Late every time we use them, sometimes over 3 hours. Rude to customers also scamming on baggage charges where they try to double charge saying they can't find proof that you paid for your baggage. Avoid.

### "the service is one-star"
Prague to Nice. The price of the ticket with CSA (Czech Airlines) is at the same level as of Lufthansa, but the service is one-star. First, even if my flight was the very first one that day, it was delayed for 40 minutes, because the crew was missing! They did not told us the reason, I had to ask. Second, the interior and the seats were very old and used, even Ryanair has better and modern seats. The seats have no spaces for legroom and are extremely uncomfortable. Any low-cost airlines have more space. They do not serve food nor drinks even for their high prices. Beware: Czech Airlines, ČSA, Travel Service and SmartWings is just one airline. As they are a monopoly on the Czech market, they charge high prices for extremely low services.

### "refuse to refund my ticket"
Kiev to Paris via Prague. I'll never book a flight with that company again. I had a transfer in Prague and missed my connection because the airport had open only one security checkpoint and we had to wait for a long time, but the company refuse to refund my ticket or find me a new one (even though we were like 15 passengers in the same situation), and I had to buy another one to get back home. Now, it has been one week and I still don't know where my baggage is, I have had no news of it whatsoever. I filled all the online forms I could find but received no answer. I also tried to call them every day since my missed flight but though the general helpline answers quickly, the number they give me for my lost baggage doesn't seem to work - nobody answers anyway. I have tried everything, even going to Paris airport, but nobody knows anything about my baggage, which is really annoying as of course I had all of my clothes inside. So if you think that a low cost company is a good idea, think again!! In the end, I have spent more than twice the amount I planned for that flight, between booking a new flight, a new bus after that, and now being obliged to buy new clothes.

### "experience thoroughly unpalatable"
Helsinki to Prague. My experience with Czech Airlines was thoroughly unpalatable, I wonder how they can be part of the SkyTeam at all. Not only was the flight running late, the plane itself was an extremely old and poorly configured 737-400. It was immediately clear that passenger comfort was of no interest to this carrier given that the air conditioning vents were not aligned to the seats and the pitch of the seats themselves were so narrow so as to replicate the feeling of a sardine can. Service aboard the plane was unspectacular and ambivalent, but not offensive. There was no effort to "wow" the passenger at all. I most certainly would recommend arriving in Prague by any other airline available.

### "I am really displeased"
Prague to Stockholm. I am really displeased with the way Czech Airlines mismanaged my flight today and denied me a seat I had booked and paid for almost a month ago. I had my boarding pass in hand and just before my amazed eyes, I was asked very rudely to step aside while two other passengers were given way and let on the plane. My calls for help - and later cries of frustration - got nowhere. Instead I was asked to take a flight the next day! I tried to explain that I had to be at work the next day to no avail. The people from your airlines kept me waiting for almost two hours before sending me to the residence next to airport with food vouchers! I am now feeling desperate and upset and experiencing serious panic attacks as I am not sure what is going to happen tomorrow. It seems to me that I have been trapped here in Prague and there is absolutely nothing I can do. Who is going to compensate for all the emotional distress and professional as well as financial loss I am bearing?

### "seats not the most comfortable"
Not Verified |  Prague to Kiev. Nothing much. The plane wasn't very clean. The seats are not the most comfortable. The water was carried out only once and only before landing. The plane was 1 hour and 30 minutes late. The service was ordinary. It could have been better.

### "never fly with them again"
Amsterdam to Zagreb via Prague. The flight was operated by Smart Wings, they did not have anything on the menu on aircraft. After a one hour delay we spent an additional hour sitting in the aircraft. The delay caused missing my connection flight and arriving to my destination 12 hours later than planned, missed out on work etc. No answer from them, I have been waiting for more than a month. I have never had such a terrible experience and service, will never fly with them again.

### "temperature unpleasantly high"
Amsterdam to Prague. The departure was delayed by just under 2 hours with no information sent in advance - one found out only at the airport. Check-in facilities lacked a simple swift baggage drop which with only 2 or 3 desks being open contributed to a longer than expected queue. As we were boarding, we noticed our seat allocation from check-in desk boarding cards differed than the one from our online check-in boarding passes with seats now separated by multiple rows (this was not communicated to us). The ground staff couldn't explain why there was a seat change and showed little care about swapping us back together. On the plane, it was very hot and FA informed they cannot switch on the AC until engines are started. Throughout the flight, the temperature continued to be unpleasantly high. At the arrival, the crew provided the least specific reason for the delay and rushed to say it was not their fault. Deplaning was through a bridge but in the middle passengers were asked to climb down stairs and get on the bus with no help provided for the elderly. Flying EZY on this route is a better choice - unless the fares are higher than the Czech Airlines prices.

### "Will avoid CSA in the future"
Not Verified |  Copenhagen-Prague return. It was a few years since I last flew Czech Airlines and I remembered them as an OK airline offering rather good quality and value for money. No such luck nowadays, since they were taken over by Smartwings company which seems to have destroyed the airline totally! Copenhagen-Prague in a Czech-Airlines-painted A319. Aircraft in rather good shape but the onboard service (BOB only) seems very strangely organised and takes forever to reach your seat - only to be told they were out of choices. Prague-Copenhagen in a Smartwings 737. One hour late, extremely cramped seating, aircraft looking worn and very dirty, cabin air quality bad and temperature too warm. Everything with this airline nowadays just looks so amateurish and cheap - from their print-at-home boarding passes to their badly cleaned cabins. Onboard announcements in english are barely understandable. And don't dream of buying some duty-free at the airport because then you'll have to pay extra to take it onboard the aircraft. This was a real disappointment. Will avoid CSA in the future! Only positive thing was that they still played Bedrich Smetana's Vltava in the loudspeakers after touchdown in Prague...

### "First flight late"
Milan Malpensa to Birmingham via Prague. First flight late from Milan to Prague, second flight late from Prague to Birmingham, lost my luggage - something more? Yes! After 5 days I still don't have my luggage.

### "Worst company I have ever used"
Stockholm to Antalya via Prague. Worst company I have ever used. Two delayed flights and treated med really bad. I never use this awful company ever again. If you think about flying with this company, do not.

### "Overpriced services"
Prague to Brussels. Worst airline I have ever flown. Overpriced services and charging for absolutely everything on top of the basic ticket price. Worse than low-cost airlines.

### "Shocking service!"
Prague to Paris. Shocking service! This airline use to be good and became to be unbearable! I booked a flight and later added a checked in suitcase, paid with credit card and received confirmation Email from Czech Airlines. During check in, I was told I didn't pay for my suitcase and have I to pay on the spot. I've presented the confirmation email I had, but it didn't seem to change anything. The demand was that I will pay €45 (rather than €25 online). I refused to accept that and was sent to Czech Airlines ticket office which mend by external company, has no right to change anything and has no supervisor. They did nothing to resolve the issue. They said I will have to pay to board the flight and I can contact service to claim refund later. I was left with no choice, but to pay the €45. Sure enough, I wrote to the airline immediately, but no reply received. Another issue is when you buy Czech Airlines ticket, you assumes you will fly with standard airline company but this is wrong! You buying standard but the operator is Smartwing which is Low cost airline with shocking service. I use to fly 6 times a year or more with them but I'm done! NEVER AGAIN!

### "The worst airline ever"
Madrid to Prague. The worst airline ever. They are overpriced - prices like classic airlines but service worse than low-cost airlines. I am trying to avoid them each time I have to fly somewhere, but unfortunately I live in Prague, so sometimes they are the only option. Only 2 btimes from my last 15 flights there were no delay. Normally it is from 1-3 hour if you are lucky. It is a big surprise when they have classic gate and you do not have to travel by buss to plane. Their excuses (about delays, taking your hand-luggage down to plane so u have to waiting for them etc) are understable for children at maximum.

### "were professional, friendly, attentive"
Recently flew CSA on Prague - Seoul - Prague route and can not say a bad word. The crew were professional, friendly, attentive. Service on par with 4 star airlines like BA or Finnair. Meals of very good quality and plentiful. Flights smooth, on time. Cabin showed the age but was clean. Good, old CSA proved they can provide good service as they used to do years ago. Would happily fly this route again with them. Unfortunately this is more or less the last "original CSA" route existing. They celebrated 95 years and literally died. By being taken over by Travel Service/Smart Wings things got to the worst possible level. Travel Service/Smart Wings have never been reliable airline with non existent customer service and flying with them is always a lottery - you may get lucky and get to your destination on time and get there at all or you are simply unlucky. Some of my last experiences just proved that (both flying under Smart Wings flight code or Czech Airline flight code). You are told you fly with Smart Wings but in reality you fly with Mongolian Airlines! The same happens with CSA now. You are told you fly with CSA but in reality you fly with Smart Wings. Hence all those problems mentioned by previous reviewers - delays, old planes (they got rid off the original CSA fleet), no customer service, bullying customers for 1 kilogram of overweight, more often technical incidents etc. etc. It's shame on Czech state and government to let things go that far and to degrade once highly recognized airlines! Let's see how long will this Seoul route survive. For other routes you probably will be much better off with others.

### "Worst airline ever flown"
Prague to Amsterdam. Worst airline I have ever flown. On the outward flight from Schiphol, the gate was changed 3 times, and i had to walk to the other side of the airport. The plane was 2 hours late because it was "busy over Germany. The staff was irritated, the plane outdated (from Travel Service) and no apology was offered. Return trip was slightly better since the plane was then 'only' delayed by one hour (probably due to the cleaning because the plane was at the gate on time). The staff was friendlier and we were offered free water. This time we were in an outdated aircraft from Smartwings. I have even better experiences with Ryanair and will choose this airline over Czech airlines the next time.

### "just a total disappointment"
Flew CSA Czech Airlines from Prague to Milan. Worst airline ever, considering it is not a budget airline. Horrible customer service, little space between the seats, constant delays. Woman’s small purse is considered a piece of luggage so had to push it inside my suitcase. They don’t even offer complimentary water during the flight (again this is not a budget airline!) just a total disappointment. Try to avoid!

### "mixed up my boarding pass"
The lady at the counter mixed up my boarding pass with another person who's name starts with the same letter, at first i thought thats how they spell my name in Czech, then later when i verified she thanked me for pointing it out and said my name wasnt there on the list as it wasnt expanded as in the passport but was initialed. She asked me to go to another counter and get it changed or verified if it was okay. Lady at the second counter made us wait for like 15 minutes and then even though i was in queue she prioritised another person in the line as he could speak Czech and i couldnt and asked me to give this gentlemen privacy. She made fun of my last name over the phone while getting it verified then verified that it was okay. Of course the flight was delayed by 2.25 Hrs and the gate changed thrice.

### CSA Czech Airlines customer review
Paris to Prague. Bad customer service. I  checked in using their app, my assigned seat was 1C, at boarding for no reason or no explanation my seat was changed to 33D. I’ve asked to see if there’s any other seats available, they barked at me saying flight is full. After take off my brother sends me a picture of 1C which is empty. I’m really confused why would the ticket agent do this to me? This airline is rude, unprofessional .

### "service was simply terrible"
Madrid to Prague. Unfortunately, there is nothing good that can be said about this airline except for being transported home safely. That really is the only positive thing about my trip. The flight was operated by an outdated airplane that has not been cleaned for a very long time, service onboard provided was simply terrible - the way the staff treats its passengers is just the worst including just a basic things as announcements are. One of the worst I have ever seen. The flight was delayed about 2 hours. Online booking at CSA website was a hell. Being Czech, I feel even more sorry about what Czech Airlines became over the last years. What a great airline it was.

### "more than 3 hours delay"
Not Verified |  Hamburg to Prague. Horrible. For a 1 hour flight, there was at first 1.5 hour delay beginning at 8:00, followed by another last minute delay for a total of more than 3 hours delay. The same issue for the return flight resulting in a missed booked train and getting home close to 3:00 instead of 22:00. Little to no info was provided to the passengers. Found out later it had been going on for a few days. Will not fly again.

### "Terrible experience"
Copenhagen to Barcelona via Prague. Terrible experience. After being told I had to check my baggage I also had to pay 30€, then they did not get my bag or anyone else's on the transfer, bags on the second flight and we were left without for almost two days. I also was left on stand by without being told at any point when buying my ticket that I was. And so were at least 20 other passengers. The customer service was terrible and they would not even give me a glass of water. I will never fly this airline again.

### "flight time is just a concept"
Nice to Prague. From early in the morning, one hour and twenty minutes of delay. It seems like the new standard for this airline as it is one of the so many this year. OK used to be a fairly good company, but now flight time is just a concept and connecting in Prague is like playing at the lottery, hoping you will get the winning ticket.

### "like an early-days budget airline"
Not Verified |  Prague to Madrid. Really nothing positive to say about this airline. Flights delayed both ways. I saw staff behaving aggressively to other passengers. Cabin was dirty. It's run like an early-days budget airline, without budget prices. Don't fly with them if you have other options.

### "become a terrible airline"
Not Verified |  Flown 3 times in a row Czech Airlines. Each flight seriously delayed. Just had friends from Paris and once again flight delayed and now cancelled for technical problems. Has become a terrible airline, used to be so good. If you come from UK use easyjet, JET2 or Ryanair, much more reliable

### "uncomfortable seats"
Flying Czech Airlines or SmartWings (same company) is like a russian roulette. No one knows if everything will go smoothly or not. In my case, it was OK. For the price do not expect much. No free catering, uncomfortable seats, staff is fine though. I mean for flights within Europe (2-3 hours) it is decent and still better than flying Ryanair and others. Still choosing between Finnair and CSA on the same route again, I would definitely go for Finnair.

### "Never without a delay"
Prague to Copenhagen. Horrible, we all got treated like a sheep walking from gate to gate and waiting first hour, then two, and at the end 4 hours. Never ever again will I choose this airline even if they would pay me. It has always been a trouble making airline. Never without a delay. Could at least be honest at the beginning and tell us come 4h later morons.

### "disgraceful how they treat foreign passengers"
Prague to Paris. I flew with CSA after very long time, so I was curious what to expect. Boarding was quite smooth, except that airport staff wasn’t very friendly and were having laugh about none Czech speaking passengers, which I find very ruth. Seats on plane were ok, but nothing special, the bad experience started when they were serving food. On menu it says, that they accept Czech and Euro currency and most of CC cards, so I handed 500 czech note to pay for my food and was told, that they have no change to give me back(talking about Czech currency on board of Czech airlines) that I should pay in Euro or card, so I handed card, without asking if I want to pay in Euro or Kc, charge me Euro price, which is always worst rate, than your cc bank rate. When I complained about it, I was told there is nothing they could do about it. So I asked for refund and returned what I purchased, you should should see the faces of crew when I told them that I understand Czech and heard how were they talking about the issue, it’s absolutely disgraceful how they treat foreign passengers. I will think twice before I buy next ticket with this airline as their attitude can completely ruin your journey.

### "you can get good price"
Prague to Helsinki. My 2nd flight with CSA,actually it was SmartWing's plane as they now operate many CSA flights. 14 yr old Boeing 737. Many times CSA flights are delayed, so i was a little bit worried. But this was on time. The price (50eur) included one normal size cabin bag of 8kg. Service was ok. No complains there. Food and drinks were available to buy. I bought some Czech beer and a delicious panini, not expensive at all. CSA has a little bit bad reputation (mostly because flights are delayed) but many times you can get good price, so they are worth trying.

### "even water is not free"
Copenhagen to Prague. After observing the abuse by the gate staff, I did a little research and Czech airlines was sold to a private company Travel Service based in Prague and is now privately owned. Their obvious philosophy is to get as many 50 euro checked bags as possible. Seats are crammed and even water is not free! Check in procedure is terrible, gate staff rude (contracted out to Menzies) and confirmed by many reviews. I am a dual Czech / Canadian citizen and do not understand why the Czech government does not put a stop to this company. For many tourists an airline is the first point contact. Do not get discouraged by the airline, book with someone else and enjoy one of the most amazing cities in the world!

### "the legroom was very small"
I took early morning flight from Paris-CDG to Prague-PRG. There were no services available on board (wifi, entertainment system), but the flight was very short (like most of EU flights) so it really doesn't matter. Flight was late approx. 1 hour because of previous delay. We were flying in very old Smart Wings aircraft which was very noisy and overall uncomfortable. Seats were made of leather, which was great - because they were warm all the time, but the legroom was very small. The crew was very kind, but the prices of food on board were really high. Despite that, CSA offers really the best prices for cigarettes on board among EU airlines. It is very traditional EU low-cost airline. In fact, I have nothing to complain about expect the old aircraft and ticket price.

### "my seat was dirty"
Madrid to Odessa via Prague. Disappointed. On the first flight, we waited 45 minutes in the jet bridge, due to the plane being cleaned. Well when we got in, my seat was dirty, and there were crumbs all over the place. However, we did order the In-flgiht meal and it was amazing, if you do fly with this airline, I recommend buying an on-board meal. Our second flight, was delayed by four hours, departing at 2 AM. Once we got to our destination, we waited another hour for our luggage. By the time we left the airport, the sun was already up.

### "pay 45 eur for 20x20 cm bag"
Prague to Helsinki. Had to pay 45 eur for 20x20 cm bag at the gate because it was “additional item” to a cabin sized small suitcase. Handbag had to either be put in suitcase (which was full) or pay 45 eur.

### "poor customer experience"
Flying from Amsterdam to Prague on Oct 18th. The boarding has been delayed and real disorganized. The plane was fully booked. I was astonished to see that the cabin crew allowed couple of passengers to board the plane with an open can of beer in their hands. The plane was dirty and service was lousy. Perhaps this is why people are bringing aboard their drinks. Everything looked real cheap (ex. the airticket) and amateurish. A very poor customer experience.

### "dissatisfied with their service"
Stockholm to Prague booked for December 2018. I am very dissatisfied with their service and do not want to ever fly again. After booking I realized immediately that I by mistake typed my name twice instead of writing my boyfriend's name in the passenger column. I called them and cancelled the flight within an hour so that I could book again with correct name as it states on their website that it is not allow to change names for 'safety reasons'. When later talking to the agent, the airline refunded me only 20 euros out of 350euros! They said it is my mistake that I cancelled my flight. Completely inhumane. They try to rob people of money and go low cost at the extreme I will never fly with them again!

### "the worst airline"
Copenhagen to Prague. This is the worst airline and customer service i have ever experienced, and i have been traveling around the world for 15 years and seen it all. First we were forced to pay for our cabin baggage because our laptop bag and purse counted as our "cabin luggage". Its was 3 of us flying and in total we had a backpack, laptop bag, my purse a small suitcase and a store bag with a present. That apparently counts as 5 pieces of "luggage". As far as i know everyone is allowed one personal bag and a carry on?! The women who i was speaking with was so rude and said that whoever told us we could bring that stuff, wasn't doing their job (other people with the airline said it was fine). When i showed her written proof on our boarding pass that we brought the allowed amount she claimed the boarding pass doesnt mean anything and the website states otherwise. I found on the website then, that in fact we didn't need to pay and our carry ons were perfectly fine with the rules. And to top it off, we pay for the "extra luggage", board our flight and then we have no room for our things in the overhead compartments. Literally 0 space. So we nicely ask the flight attendant if she could put our things anywhere else. She rudely says no and tells us to put it under our seat.

### "A truly bad experience"
Prague to Amsterdam. Forced to check a carry on bag at the gate, pay 45 Euro and then they lost my bag. To make matters worse I was connecting on a different airline to Toronto and then Vancouver. So I had to exit the secured area and pass security a second time. Rude, impatient, dismissive. A truly bad experience from start to finish. I will never fly with them again.

### "Flight was cancelled"
Prague to Copenhagen. Flight was cancelled, but not after waiting two hours with no info, being boarded, waiting another half an hour in the plane and being kicked out. But that was just the beginning of the fun part. Initially the flight was declared "delayed" with no further info what is going on in terms of changing aircraft or rebooking. People on the ground knew nothing, keeping us in limbo as we could not receive a compensation if it was delayed. Then after about 4 hours the flight was cancelled. And then the earliest flights we could be re-booked for were on the next day. My foot will never step into an aircraft of this company again.

### "top 3 worst airline"
Milan to Stockholm via Prague. In my personal top 3 worst airline in Europe. The only time I had to fly with them for business I got delayed because of the rain in Prague. I missed my connection and then the usual happened : no indication where to go, priority line closed at transfer desk, having to wait for hours to get another flight, staff giving incomplete indications etc. My day of work was lost because of them. Compensation was almost nonexistent. If your flight as any little problem, they will let you down.

### "operated by Smartwings"
Barcelona to Prague. I bought ticket with Czech Airlines, but the flight was operated by Smartwings, one of the worst airlines. Their Boeings does not have much space for legs build for low cost company with this configuration.

### "delayed as usual"
We were flying with Czech Airlines on 31.07.2018 from Barcelona to Prague, planes was delayed as usual - CSA (part of Smartwings / Travelservice company) is always delayed at least 1 hour. At the end we had 2 hours delay. The issues we had during the flight: There was no space for normal sitting on the seat - even Ryanair has more distance between the seats, we felt like sardines. Because the AC temperature has been set to 15-16 degrees, we were freezing all the time and on our question if they could increase the temperature the stewardess said: "maybe, we cant guarantee" - at the end (10 minutes before landing) she came again to us to tell that now it will be warm again. Really dont understand how such company can still fly.

### "experienced huge delays"
Prague to Amsterdam. Avoid at all costs. Normally i dont post reviews, but this airline is the worst ever. On every flight I experienced huge delays. And no information whatsoever on the causes or info on the expected duration of the delay. Between Ams en Prague a 2 hour delay is normal for this company. And no sorry, no delay treat or so. On a flight that lasts only 1,5 hour I expect punctuality.

### "experience you want to avoid"
Not Verified |  Madrid to Prague. Always delayed. I take regularly flight Madrid-Prague and více versa and its average delay is 1 hour and more. Does not happen with other airlines, so the excuse claiming it is Madrid´s airport fault is rather empty. They are the cheapest, but it is an experience you want to avoid if you can afford it.

### "flight is also delayed"
I purchased a roundtrip ticket from Beirut to Prague. First time the flight was delayed to depart for an hour and half due to late arrival of the aircraft. Now (after 10 days) I am at Prague airport and the flight is also delayed another hour and a half for the same reason m. Also, my Czech business partner informed me that three weeks ago his flight was delayed for an hour when traveling to Beirut from Prague on Czech airlines. So there is a clear and intentional misorganization of the flight schedules. In addition, the flight provides no valuable services for its passengers and everything need to be paid for knowing that it’s not a low cost carrier.

### "delays and unassigned seats"
Copenhagen to Prague. This is actually the worst airline I have traveled. Delays, unassigned seats, nobody gives you more information and the crew does not know what to do when flight is overbooked. This was the only time I flight with them, will never book on that airline again. The aircraft was old.

### "Very poor service"
Århus to Moscow via Prague. I travelled together with my 6 years old son by this airline the 22 june. We supposed to arrive to Moscow at 16 o’clock, but the plane was 1,5 hours late. As a result We missed the next flight and had to find a place to stay overnight, that was not easy. I wrote a complain to the official site, but didn’t get any answer still. I don’t recommend this airline to anybody. Very poor service and indifference to customers.

### "I did not feel comfortable at all"
I booked CSA on return journey back from CPH to PRG (used Norwegian to get there). While the flight was supposed to be operated by Airbus 319, upon getting to gate I spotted Boeing 737-400 rented from Go 2 Sky, slovak charter airline. This plane has a history of more than 25 years, when it was flying all over the World (operated by several unknown airlines too). The interior was really old, felt like a vintage plane and seat pitch very small. When booking a flight, safety is one of my priorities and this time I did not feel comfortable at all. I was Gold FF member of CSA for more than 10 years in a row, but I am happy that there are other options these days and I do not have to travel with them so frequently anymore.

### "disregard and discomfort"
Prague to Rome. We traveled by Czech Airlines on April 13, 2018 and had a big disappointment with the company. I would not recommend anyone to travel for it. The flight was packed, at the time of boarding our hand luggage had to go in the luggage compartment. As our bags were organized we decided not to risk placing these bags in them for fear of losing or delaying our flight. So far so good, but we were charged an exorbitant amount for carrying a small bag with our passports, tickets and hotel documents, as well as a small backpack almost empty with wrappers in case of cooling during the trip or landing. It was charged more than R $ 400,00 (four hundred reais) or something close to 100 euros, and one of the receipts issued was delivered with the name of another passenger. After paying this amount, our bags were placed under our feet, as there was no space in the luggage compartments. We travel by TAP, easyJet and GOL airlines in economy class; in none of them was this charge traveling in the same way with the same volumes. The disgust for disregard and discomfort in paying for something we did not receive was great. I do not advise this company.

### "on board they offer nothing"
Prague to Helsinki, flights on time, cabin was clean and staff are polite and decent. The main problem is that on board they offer nothing, you have to pay for everything - even water is not free, this is a low cost airline concept.

### "best thing was the legroom"
Prague to Brussels. The best thing was the legroom, you had enough space (i'm 187cm). It was a good flight and the cabin crew was friendly and will try to help you if you have a question. It was an  A319 without entertainment. Maybe the company can give one free beverage because they are a traditional airline.

### " I was pleasantly surprised"
Prague to Seoul. I was pleasantly surprised about their service. Everything went smooth from check-in to landing. Food was fresh and tasty, crew was very nice and helpful. I did not use the in-flight entertainment system much, but airshow and music selection was good, one let down is that the system is not in Czech. We were provided with pillow and blanket plus bottle of water, which was very nice as I did not have to ask crew whenever I was thirsty. Both flights departed more or less on time and landed early. I wish their service would be so good on all of their flights.

### "maximum occupancy and minimum legroom"
Boarding process borderline rude, with boarding announcement focused around the warning that carry-ons will be checked for size and weight. Boarding personnel obviously trained to police and enforce rather than to serve. This is now part and parcel of the standard CSA travel experience since they began luring leisure travellers on rock-bottom fares with steep surcharges for checked-in baggage to what used to be business clientelle flights with decent levels of service for high-price flexible tickets (early morning to Western Europe, late evening back). Without warning, the flight was not operated by their own A319 providing decent seating comfort. Instead, they used their parent company's B737 configured for maximum occupancy and minimum legroom. With my 5' 11" / 182 cm, I had a choice between sitting with my legs spread apart or massaging the bottom of the passenger before me with my knees. Btw., their parent company is the lowcost Travel Service/Smartwings, a Czech and Chinese-owned business and one of only two carriers in Europe with two-star rating from Skytrax. Avoid if you can.

### "No options, no choice, no apology"
Prague to Ostrava (60 minutes) is sometimes merged with Prague to Košice (90 minutes) into a single flight Prague to Košice with a stopover in Ostrava, which adds some 30 to 40 minutes to total flight time for passengers to Košice. On January 12, however, CSA/Travel Service came up with something new: Prague to Ostrava via Košice. The normally 60-minute flight to Ostrava thus took 3 hours and 30 minutes! Passengers to Ostrava were taken all the way to Košice, made to leave the aircraft there, then to board again 20 minutes later and only brought to their destination on the way back to Prague. Huge savings for the carrier, zero respect to cargo. Sorry, I mean to passengers, mainly homeward business travelers on a Friday afternoon. I am appalled at the level of arrogance displayed by the once respectable national carrier. If informed in time, I could have opted for a train ride, which would have brought me home earlier and at a fraction of the cost while pampering me with all the comforts of a modern speed train like WiFi, royal amounts of legroom, nice onboard service and a well stocked dining car. Instead, I was confronted by the grim reality only at the gate minutes before boarding. No options, no choice, no apology, no compensation. Just a matter-of-factly answer to my astonished question: Yes, you will fly via Košice. And one more thing: the food included in my fare was not served, which is why I checked N/A below.

### "bad low cost service"
Prague to Barcelona. I bought the ticket via CSA web and "operated by" CSA was promised. In the end came the plane from their co-owning company Smartwings-Travel Service, which is a low cost airline. This is now turning to be very regular what CSA do. This plane was old, ugly and dirty with low cost distances between the seats, hitting the knees and I am really not a giraffe. Horrible service and the food which I ordered and paid in advance was also very bad. I used to fly CSA in the past, but since Travel Service took off I try to avoid it. You pay national airline price, but you get very bad low cost service.

### "Overall a lousy service"
Prague to Moscow on Dec 30th. My Sky Priority status and Fast Track label should allow for priority boarding. Providing, CSA would manage this process. Boarding has been a complete mess and with just a single single queue based on first come - first served. No priority for parents with the kids, business class, Sky priority or any other things you are normally used to see. The flight was fully booked but boarding has been channeled through a single person, checking all the boarding cards, passports and visa. Consequently, boarding has been an agonizing process and atmosphere was very tense. Unfortunately, my observation suggests that in Prague such a chaos is more the rule rather than exception. There has been no supervisor present at the boarding and it did not look professionally. We have arrived in Moscow with 1 hr 25 min delay. The purser apologized in Czech and English, but not in Russian. However, most of the passengers were Russians. Overall a lousy service.

### "Service below standard"
Moscow to Prague. Service below standard. Flew CSA business class from Moscow to Prague. All aspects of the service was not in line with what is normally offered in business class. And definitively much below what direct competitor is offering. It is in terms of the overall customer care, comfort of the seats, selection of the meal (in fact there was no selection! ), etc. I found CSA business class only marginally better than Lufthansa or Austrian economy. Though significantly more expensive. Not a value for money.

### "the baggage is damaged"
Frankfurt to Prague. Damaged baggage? We will take our Time! After receiving my baggage, I have noticed that the baggage is damaged beyond any repair and reported that at the desk. The claim has been registered and I was instructed to call CSA Call Center to get the info re next steps. However, when calling Call Center, this particular service was not available due to the “technical reasons”. Instead, they requested to file the complained by email. I did it (already my second filing) just to get the automatic response that I will be contacted soon. I felt, soon means one two days or so. However, after 6 days of silence I choose to call CSA myself. Service was again not available due to “technical reasons”. When calling general information, I was instructed to go to the repair shop, get protocol that baggage cannot be repaired and ask for compensation. One is wondering why they did not tel me a week ago. I was asking as to why there was no follow up and got explained that CSA has 30 days to respond. So if you fly to Prague and your baggage is damaged, you get response after 30 days. Than you have to present the document from repair shop and perhaps after next 30 days or so you might get compensated. If lucky enough. Given, I am not living in Prague, the suggestion to go to the shop and wait for the resolution of the case is impractical and  ridiculous. I am already on my way now and cannot use my baggage. Moreover, I also cannot leave my damaged baggage on its own. So baggage became a real baggage due to this ridiculous approach by CSA. I would also suggest to SkyTeam that they should harmonize their procedures across the alliance to secure user friendly and consistent services. Last time, I had damaged my baggage, I got a new one from Delta right at the spot. The fact that I am SkyTeam Gold customer is no help. I cannot be more dissatisfied with the approach taken by CSA.

### "Expensive with poor conditions"
Flew Bucharest to Prague. Expensive with poor conditions. I traveled better with Ryanair and it was also cheaper (like a quarter of the price here, with luggage included and so on). Tarom was also at a better price and with better conditions. Czech Airlines do not offer you the minimum seat space, not a good food service and also the baggage requirements are very annoying.

### "seats are comfortable enough"
First time I flown with CSA with my family from Stockholm to Prague and we were not disappointed. Check-in was smooth, boarding was smooth, economy class seats are comfortable enough for a two hr long flight. Flight attendants did their job, I did not have to interact with them at all. Take off and landing were on time. No delay. I have nothing bad to say about this airline. Same experience on the way back. Clean interior and enough place for hand baggage. Passengers can see the flight route throughout the flight. We had our own snack and water during the flight.

### "Overpriced low cost treatment"
Mixed bag of two different experiences. Paris to Prague and Prague to Kiev. Booked through travel agent and then wasn’t able to access booking on the csa.com to buy options like food or extra bag. Was able to get bag allowance via online check in where it recognized my premium status with SkyTeam. At the airport in Paris everything was smooth and easy including SkyPriority lanes available at every stage. Plane was bang on time. The seat comfort was excellent which is important to me. Didn’t have opportunity to try their meal since wasn’t able to pre-order it, but no problem for 1 hr flight. When in Prague everything changed dramatically. At the gate there was no flight info at all and no one attended. The screen showed a 2 hr delay. The csa.com has no flight status info and sends you to Prague airport website where flight was shown as leaving on time. One hour later incomprehensible announcement about gate change with exact words “The flight is leaving now from Gate X”. The crowd ran there to find new gate empty and door closed with no one around. 60 minutes later flight was called for boarding. At their home base CSA don’t maintain separate lane for business and SkyTeam passengers. All stood in one line and boarding was a mess. Onboard 2 hr flight nothing was for free, even water. Since security check is done directly at the boarding gate after shopping area you get your bottle of water purchased to bring onboard confiscated but then after the lane they have a vending machine for you to buy previously confiscated water again. When onboard no apologies for delay from the crew. Ticket price was higher than KLM on the same route. Cabin bag allowance was just 1 item of 8 kg vs KLM 12 kg and 2 items plus drinks and snacks for free. Checked baggage allowance is up to SkyTeam standards. Only 3 star for ground service due to good experience in Paris. For Prague airport they deserve no star. Overpriced low cost treatment. Inconsistent.

### "very confortable seats"
Prague to Brussels. We had an hour delay due to the bad weather and air traffic. The plane was clean with very confortable seats, landing was very smooth. Airline does not offer anything so you have to pay from their catalog. Ticket was very cheap - 38 euro. Not bad for a 1.5 flight!

### "unreasonably high prices"
Nice to Prague. Flights are mostly on time, smooth boarding and nice atmospohere in the aircraft. A319 in good condition and clean. Real shame is, that you dont even get free water on the board and everything is paid (with unreasonably high prices). Bagage allowance depends on type of your ticket, be careful (PRG to NCE for example allows only 15kg). Tickets prices might seem a bit too high. Average european airline in my opinion.

### "crew was very nice and friendly"
Brussels to Prague. Check-in Staff was nice, and Lounge provide enough Food and Beverage as well. Flight was on schedule and Cabin crew was very nice and friendly. When landed in Prague, it was not using airbridge but they provide car for Business Class Passenger. Food during on board was also enough for refreshment on short Flight.

### "worst flying experience"
Prague to Moscow. One month ago I had the worst flying experience. It all became during the flight organization and check-in and continued onboard. Even though it was not the first time I used this carrier, but that time they exceeded all expectations. The personnel on board was rude and ignorant. When people were inquiring on either coffee they were serving was ground coffee or instant one, one of those stewardesses just answered in a way just leave me alone and the coffee is not for free. My previous trip I had with the company I had been sat by the emergency exit that is usually could be considered as an advantage, that time caused me lots of trouble and the chairs were even less comfortable than I could imagine. Just after that flight I carried over to Aeroflot and it was totally remarkable difference. Also, it took a while to get our luggage from a plane. I do not recommend anybody to use that company.

### "food was fresh and tasty"
I have been travelling with CSA Czech Airlines flying to Warsaw. Unfortunately due to lack of aircraft, the flight has been delayed for more than 2 hours. No big deal for me, but I understand that some passengers might have been disgruntled on this short flight. I prepaid their business class menu, which I highly recommend, food was fresh and tasty, plenty of drinks, served in real glass and porcelain. In the aircraft one younger smiley and very nice FA, the second one was just OK. Ground services at Prague ok, in WAW they could have been faster as we waited for 15 minutes till someone came to the aircraft. Except for the delay it was a very ok experience.

### "not use Czech Airlines again"
Lisbon to Skopje via Prague. I was traveling first time with Czech airlines,  and I will never travel with them again. I was returning from a trip, from Lisbon to Skopje via Prague with my fiance. The tickets we bought were called Economy LITE but were not cheap at all. Although we bought them 4 months in advance we paid for a round trip 298 EUR and 288 EUR for he both tickets, plus 50 EUR for 1 bag checked in baggage. When we were checking in in Lisbon we were told that they will have to give us separate seats, because they are charging to give you seats next to each other. Although they had many free seats in the aircraft they gave me seat in the front of the plane ant they put my fiance at the tale. They told us try to change the tickets later, but of course, it was not possible because the plane was full, and I noticed, that many people are set randomly, and separated from their friends. They are separating the people that travel together just to charge for connected seats, you pay normal price and you receive low budget flight service. You don't receive free meal or drink during the flight. You have only 7kg hand baggage. It doesn't even include personal small bag, where you can keep your passport and money. They told us to put these small bags in the hand baggage suitcases, otherwise they would have to charge us. So we put these small bags in the suitcases and later during the flight we spent the all time hungry and thirsty, because it was too difficult to take out money or credit card out from the suitcases in the bags compartment. The flight Lisbon to Prague was late almost one hour and we almost missed our connected flight, we had to run like crazy through the airport. The thing we had separate and distant seats made the situation more difficult, we had to wait and search for each other. Fortunately the connected flight to Skopje was delayed too, so we arrived in last moment, all sweaty and tired of running. Regardless of this, at the boarding entrance, they told me to open and rearrange my suitcase, and I had to do it at the entrance on the floor, because it had one small lump of 3cm that was not fitting in the allowed dimensions, which they wanted to charge me for, although it was clearly obvious that the size of the suitcase fits perfectly, even the lump fitted if pressured, because the suitcase was not full, just one item was not set perfectly. It was my personal small bag that they told me to pack in the suitcase at the previous flight. After all this, we arrived in Skopje, but my checked in suitcase didn't arrive, although I paid extra 50EUR for this service for a checked in baggage. I made a complaint, but the web baggage tracking still can not find it after 3 hours. I hope that at least, this problem with the lost suitcase will finish well, and the suitcase will be found in the next days. I would totally not use Czech Airlines flights again. Instead making your travel easier and more comfortable, they are making it more difficult and exhausting. You pay a normal ticket price for this ticket they call "EconomyLITE" and you receive low budget flight service, even worse. Completely not worth for the money.

### "I was over by 1.4kg"
Warsaw to Prague. I had bought a ticket with no luggage by mistake and I wasn't able to add luggage online so I thought I'd just get it at the airport. When I went to check in the lady was rude, I was over by 1.4kg so she charged me an extra bag (35 euros for 23kg) and kept saying my bag was too heavy. If I had known - I could have packed an extra bag. Maybe consider hiring people who smile and are friendly to customers.

### "incredibly slow check-in"
Incredibly slow check-in for CSA Czech Airlines, disorganised lines. In the middle of the check-in procedure, signs on the desks where changed to Alitalia, which caused confusion and frustration as Alitalia passengers were trying to pass. Check in was finished 7.45 and the plane was due to depart at 8.00. No other information was given. The check in staff then ran to the gate and were ready to start boarding, but were interupted by colleagues. We had to wait for 30 minutes without information, while the staff were sorting out their problems. When boarding started it took a very long time to get all passenges aboard, and we were not ready to depart before 9.38. The excuse given was "security and confusion about boarding procedures". When the sales trolley arrived, which took almost one hour to the last rows, almost everything was sold out, even the coffee. The only thing left was hot chocolate. Leg room was very limited. When boarding was due to start for the second flight, at 8.10 PM, an announcement was made that the flight would be delayed and new information would come at 9 PM (scheduled departure was 8.40 PM). At 9 PM new information was promised at 10 PM. 9.50 PM it was suddenly announced that it was last call, so I had to hurry to the gate where we had to wait for the last passengers. On the plane not even water was given for free.

### "late in 85% of the cases"
Prague to Košice. I have taken 7 flights with CSA and there was delay in 6 of them! It means they are late in 85% of the cases. In 100% the delay was not explained and no compensations were received. Onboard you get no service at all. You have to pay even for water! Which is like low-cost. I do not understand how this carrier is a member in skyteam alliance. I use those airlines because they are the only ones operating the route I'm flying.

### "friendly and professional staff"
I welcome this new route operated by CSA Czech Airlines as it now possible to fly directly from Malmo to Prague, thus avoiding the congested Copenhagen airport. This was the inaugural flight operated by the propeller aircraft ATR 42. Check in opened 2 hours prior to departure, friendly and professional staff. To comemorate the inaugural flight, free cakes with juice was served in the waiting area before the flight. The ribbon was cut off and everyone applauded. On the flight lighter food and beverages were on sale, two professional air hostesses worked on the flight. The flight time is with 1 hrs 40 minutes considerably longer than from Copenhagen with just over an hour. I will certainly use this route again.

### "worst experience ever"
Ostrava to Paris via Prague. The worst experience ever had with airline. First flight delayed 15 min the second did not wait and no information at all (within aircraft we were 10 concerned but attendant just said she will not help since she can not take care about 20 different passengers)! Aftersell service not existing : no information about delay regulation even in request for delay > 3h. Just said go to the website. Gave 4€ for a drink where regulation is taking care about meal and 2 phone Calls. Even no hello or "we are sorry". For 328€ you do not deserve respect for them.

### "friendly and nice cabin crews"
My flight Copenhagen - Prague on 9th May 2017. Everything was perfect onboard the aircraft. Comfortable seats, friendly and nice cabin crews. The only problem was waiting for security control in Copenhagen (it is not the fault of CSA Czech Airlines) and secondly was that the flight-deck crew departed before even the safety demonstration (video) had not finished.

### "would not recommend this airline"
Amsterdam to Prague. Do not use this airline. Really bad experience. Booked tickets with cancellation insurance. Missed my flight due to a 2 hour delay in security check. The airline did not inform for possible delays in the airport due to national holiday. I called them twice from the queue asking what to do and they told me if i am checked in the plane will wait. I called them again after i lost the plane and they asked for 400euros per person to book us in the morning flight and were not helpful with the insurance. I don't think this is professional and customer friendly approach. We had to miss our holiday but there were people in the same situation that were returning home and had to book hotels and miss whatever obligation they had the next day. I would not recommend this airline.

### I would definitely recommend"
Birmingham to Prague. Fantastic flight lovely cabin crew and more leg room then the flight I had last year with Thomas Cook. It was a really enjoyable flight there and back. A baguette cost 4 euros, water 2 euros. I would definitely recommend Czech Airlines. Lovely check in staff too.

### "prepaid menu not worth it"
Prague to Brussels. Motto of CSA seems to be "pay high, fly low". The prepaid menu is not worth it, you have to choose strictly 1 cold non alcoholic drink, 1 hot drink (tee or bad coffee) and 1 alcoholic drink (wine/beer). The staff didn't allow to choose 2 cold drinks instead of it (the second one I should pay). And my small second hand bag was a big issue for ground staff even I've got written confirmation from CSA customer centre with dimensions of the second small hand bag.

### "service is quiet and professional"
I am a frequent traveller to the UK and CSA are offering flights from Prague to Birmingham and during summer to Liverpool. The planes are always clean and I like they are very comfortable. Comparing to other direct services between Prague, CSA is good choice and very cheap - much cheaper than low costs (I am booking always last week before flight). The service is quiet, professional, I get newspapers, magazines. Food is the weakest part - I do not expect anything for free but the onboard selection could be better. I was flying with Flex Plus which is more expensive and I got a meal - not a very good sandwich, although the idea was good, the sandwich was probably flying in plane whole day till it got to me. CSA is simply much more comforatble than low costs. Timing of the flights is a problem. Also the delays are quite a problem.

### "never knowingly on time"
Flew from Birmingham to Prague . Never knowingly on time. The outbound flight was over an hour late departing, the inbound flight over 40 minutes late departing. This is the first time I have flown with Czech Airlines and most likely the last. Whilst delays are sometimes to be expected, it seems that this airline can't get itself organised to leave on time. The in-flight service suffers from the same lack of focus. It took the best part of an hour to serve passengers and the cabin crew made no attempt to move if a passenger was waiting to get to the lavatories at the rear of the plane. The seat pitch is tiny. I couldn't recommend this airline.

### "attendants were unprofessional"
Kosice to Frankfurt via Prague. This trip with CSA was my first experience with a low-cost airline. The ticket was not low-cost, but the whole experience sure felt that way. All food and beverages had to be paid, the flight attendants were only interested to sell something, the plane was an old turboprop with the bare basics, the seat was cramped and uncomfortable. The plane of the second segment left Prague with 20 min delay. The flight attendants were unprofessional; one of them was openly flirting with a Czech man just in front of me. The other, when I noted that the pilot mentioned that we would arrive at Frankfurt 30' late and I would thus miss my train, rudely responded that we would land only 5 mins late, without of course taking into account that arrival means to the terminal, not to the landing strip. So I did miss my train and I hope that I will never have to travel with CSA again. Incidentally, a small espresso take-away at the Prague terminal cost 4 Euro!

### "a low-cost level"
Rome to Prague with CSA Czech Airlines. The biggest problem with this airline is the management. They pushed the level of the Czech national carrier to a low-cost level. No catering at all on board. You can only buy some poor quality snacks. Legroom was simply terrible, I could barely fit. Another problem was that no checked baggage was included in price. So everybody took baggage on board, so if you came later on board, you probably wouldn't find any space for your bag. But the crew was really nice, kind and friendly - they did their best.

### "allowance for checked luggage 15kg"
After suffering a Czech Airline flight from Warsaw to Prague, I had the misfortune to further suffer a flight from Prague to Venice. I was surprised that the allowance for checked luggage is 15kg, while practically all airlines give 20 (or 23)kg. They say all airlines are different, but having flown with most, Czech is the only airline that is so mean. My luggage was 16 kg and the agent insisted that I retrieve 1 kg from the suitcase, in the check in line. On the flight there is no service. Even water is charged and I am glad to see that practically no one buys anything. The ATR aircraft is slow so the short trip took 1 hr 40 min. Czech had only some 17 planes and 7 of which are ATR.

### "outbound delay 4hrs, inbound delay 3hrs"
Liverpool to Prague with CSA Czech Airlines. Outbound delayed over 4hrs and inbound delayed over 3hrs. No explanation given - we were given a food voucher which would just about cover drink and a biscuit which is totally unacceptable. The airline staff were not apologetic or helpful in anyway. We are frequent fliers and have not had service so poor. It was our first time to Prague to a family wedding. Prague was lovely and so near from Liverpool we would go again but not with service like this. One delay possibly but two delays in one week totalling over 7 hours is totally unacceptable.

### "worst seats I have ever had"
Prague to Copenhagen. Czech Airlines are worst. I have been flying a lot this year and I never had any problems until flying with them this week. They were very strict with luggage, allowing checked-in luggage only for 15kg otherwise I had to pay 40€ more. Normally an airline has a 23kg limit for checked-in luggage. They were quite unfriendly and at the gate I had to leave my bagpack for the check-in luggage, even if with any other airline I could keep both so far and the worst is that they lost everything that was in the side pockets, no secure passage provided for this luggage that should have passed as hand luggage. Additionally I was seated in the last row of the airplane and those were the worst seats I have ever had with even for a small person like me no space at all. I'm very annoyed and I'll never fly with them again.

### "almost at the European standard"
Prague to Rome. After my previous negative experience with CSA (flying a Slovak B737 in a charter configuration on a regular CSA route), this flight was fine and almost at the European standard. Very friendly and supportive cabin personnel. Although no meal or drinks are given for free, 8 EUR for a "business menu" (if booked in advance) is an acceptable option and recommended. CSA should not use any low cost or charter airplanes (Smartwings, Travel Service etc), but only its Airbus fleet.

### "worst experience in my life"
The worst experience in my life. When I tried to check in at the Stockholm Arlanda airport to fly to Incheon via Prague on July 11, the person at the counter told me that the CSA flight to Prague was 2 hours delayed and eventually I will not be able to transfer to Incheon as well. Even worse, the person at the counter didn't know what to do and has no sympathy to help me; he just hand me the CSA call center number and keep saying I should figure out the next plan by myself. CSA didn't give me any notice of the delayed flight. I called the call center and after a long phone call, they arranged me the KLM tickets. But unlike the tickets I paid for, this KLM tickets worth less mileage; I paid for 70% mileage tickets and received 25% mileage. And seats were uncomfortable since I had few choices. I claimed my loss at CSA customer claim site, but CSA never replied nor show any interest in solving the problem. It was the worst airline I had ever known.

### "won't be flying this airline again"
I was checking at Amsterdam Airport for flight to Prague. I was using the business check in as I'm SkyTeam Elite Plus customer through Alitalia. At desk, the clerk said I need to pay for my luggage. I was surprised as one luggage is free for Elite Plus customers, so I asked why is this. To my amazement clerk said because you don't have valid status level. I showed my card again, but she said, nope their system doesn't see my status. I offered to show my status on Alitalia website also but she refused to look at it and demanded 20 euro luggage fee. After 10 minutes argument, I paid. After check in I went to KLM lounge and asked them to check if they see some issue with my status but their system showed my Elite Plus status correctly so it must have been Czech Airlines system that was not working. The clerk attitude at check in desk was being demeaning all the time, saying you don't understand how status levels work and you need to fly enough to get status etc. which I found abysmal for business check clerk behaving like this. After trip I emailed Czech Airlines customer service and they acknowledged the issue and said it was their system and was willing to refund the 20 euro). You bet I won't be flying with this airline ever again.

### "the worst flying experience"
After many flights with Lufthansa and Swiss I tried CSA Czech Airlines once more. This was the worst flying experience. There was an A319 planned for both routes Prague-Copenhagen and Copenhagen-Prague but a 20 year old B737 leased from Slovakia was used instead. The interior was very old and seats so close that even low cost carriers have a bigger pitch. There was no free water (nor snack) provided on a flight lasting 80 min. Return flight was a few hours delayed for technical reasons and was operated by a Smartwings low-cost B737.

### "never fly this airline again"
Venice to Prague was absolutely terrible. Took over two hours to load the baggage only to have it removed and no justification given or how it would be delivered to the passengers affected. Over 20 passengers affected and the crew put the blame on the ground crew in Venice and not CSA airlines, even though the CSA Pilot directed the removal of the bags. Terrible service, attitude or help in giving us an explanation of when our bags would arrive. Will never fly this airline again.

### "I do not recommend"
Prague to Moscow was an unforgettable experience with Czech Airlines. Remembering a pleasant flight with this company several years back, we decided to go for buying the tickets for this-year trip and it was our mistake : pricy tickets do not guarantee your timely flight, any decent food (even though are offered a choice of food option while booking the ticket) – only Maggi-cup as a main course for 3.5 euros; no water free of charge will be offered to you. Several flights including low-cost flights were united both on the way to and fro Prague, so there was no difference in the quality of the flight apart from the unfair price. The only response that we could get out of the crew was that the company changed the policy some months ago. But it hasn’t even bothered to inform the customers beforehand. One more disappointment was awaiting for us on our way back from Prague when we used the online check-in option but still had to undergo the queuing at the check-in gates, as a drop-box was not existent for some reason. After boarding on the flight we had to sit for an hour in the plane due to technical problems. I do not recommend flying Czech Airlines unless you don’t care about the comfort and price.

### "very attentive service"
I flew with CSA Czech Airlines from Amsterdam to Moscow, changing in Prague. Overall it was a very pleasant experience, apart from the handling agent in AMS who did not seem to be well informed about the baggage allowance, it took some explanation, but in the end, the problem was solved. The flight from AMS to PRG was a very short intra-EU hop, with no food/drinks provided. Didn't miss it on such a short flight, though. Early arrival into Prague, so smooth connection. For the flight to Moscow, I had pre-ordered an "upgrade menu" for 12 euro - basically you get served a business meal in economy and this certainly was worth every cent. Nice food, including very attentive service. Early arrival into Moscow. All in all, a very good experience.

### "worst Business class flight ever"
Hamburg to Prague return with Czech Airlines, and the worst Business class flight ever. No free seat next to you, and the seat not adjustable, food terrible, overhead reading light was not working. On the way into Prague from Hamburg, the business class cabin was full with sleeping crew from previous flight. Had to change seat. Ground staff in Prague needed 15 min for boarding pass print out. Unbelievable.

### "recommend you avoid them"
Madrid to Prague. I am now exhausted by Czech Airlines and recommend you avoid them. If you fly with them you'll probably be fine but if anything goes wrong they appear to be incapable of handling even the most basic process towards a resolution. You cannot talk to anyone, only submit emails via an online system that is hard work and seems to not consistently deliver messages to anyone. I cannot find any named person to whom you can direct a problem - very frustrating. And their stated resolution process means you have to first send off your bank details, name and address etc before they will discuss your problem and possible compensation. I flew for work and my luggage did not arrive, my bag arrived at the airport the following morning but despite assurances that I would get it "soon" it took them 3 days to deliver it to me by which time I was on my way home have not been able to work because materials I needed were in my luggage. Not an apology, no compensation, just frustration at being at the receiving end of their incompetence.

### "pay for everything"
Our flight from Milan to Prague was delayed by half an hour, we didn't get even get a glass of water, you have to pay for everything. I ordered instant noodles for 3.50EUR, but when they served them to me they told me that the water was not hot enough and so the noodles were brittle and crunchy! In the end, we flew in a tiny propeller plane. The service at the airport was the slowest check-in I have gone through, long waiting for the bus to the aircraft, then long waiting inside the bus in cold weather. All this for 3500 CZK/129 EUR for a one-way flight.

### "no apology was made"
CSA Czech Airlines is terrible. They just cancelled our Dusseldorf to Prague flight and rebooked us to another one without any information beforehand. Also we were changed from a direct flight to a flight with a stop. Therefore we left the hotel too early and family was waiting for us way too long. Staff at the airport did not even try and explain anything or tell why our flight was cancelled and not even an apology was made. They knew they could do this without paying a compensation and then no longer care for their customers. And we didn't even have cheap tickets!

### "you get onboard nothing"
If you compare what CSA Czech Airlines have been offering some 10-15 years ago, it is a real catastrophe they are facing nowadays. For a ticket (buy it some 4-6 months in advance) from Amsterdam via Prague to Kosice (distance of 1500 km) you pay at least 300 euro. And what do you get onboard - completely nothing. Not even a glass of a water. On top of that, you have the right to check in one suitcase of max 15kg and 1 hand baggage of 8 kg. Is it worth this price? I do not think so. For each extra kg they charge you 10 euro. Unbelievable. To compare, KLM is operating a direct flight from Amsterdam to Budapest with prices starting at 99 euro for a return flight, plus you have a full service onboard (snack, sodas, warm drinks etc). I hope that the management of CSA will analyse the current situation not only when it comes to their salaries but also for benefit of all customers. Otherwise they risk to lose even this small group of clients they have at the moment.

### "very pleasant experience"
Czech Airlines from Prague to Seoul was largely satisfactory. In business class there was only myself and one other gentleman, allowing me to spread out. I therefore received a lot of attention and was very well waited on (sometimes so well it was almost annoying). The service was excellent, staff are very polite, welcoming and made you feel like royalty (and if anyone knows how cold Czech people can be sometimes, this was very refreshing and a great feeling). The attendant's level of English was great and there was a Korean Air hostess on the flight to attend to Korean speakers who couldn't speak Czech or English. I had a vegetarian meal, it was pretty bad. Cold carrot sticks and capsicum (pepper for all you American English speakers), is not a meal - especially when the small side salad was exactly the same thing. However the amount of food was too much and therefore I did not go hungry. Drinks standard and you could have as much as you wanted, whenever you wanted, which made it easier to stay hydrated. I cannot attest to the quality and service of alcohol. The seat comfort was pretty good, the seat reclined to a full bed and at no time did I feel any pain, except the headrest was a bit hard to sleep on. The small pillows Czech Airlines provided are hard and dense. The entertainment was on the same system as Korean Air, and there was a very small selection of entertainment - it was also a shocking selection of entertainment, not many decent holywood movies. The cabin was clean, toilets were kept clean. The welcome pack they give you is pretty standard: socks, eye mask, little tubes of cream and lip balm, slippers, tooth brush and toothpaste. I think you get what you pay for, but remember it's not Emirates or you would be paying 3-4 times more. I found it to be a very pleasant experience, and while the food sucked, I'm sure those on regular diets would have gotten a nicer meal.

### "value for money"
Czech Airlines flies to Edinburgh twice a week via Lodz. Passengers continuing from Lodz to Edinburgh remain during a 30 min layover onboard. Ticket bought online through the airline website at good price. Online check-in open 30 hours before departure, only the outbound flight could be processed at that moment. Prague is a hassle free airport. Bused to the aircraft (A319). All economy cabin. Between Prague and Lodz light load of passengers, pretty busy on Lodz-Edinburg-Lodz thanks to Polish travelers. No pre-recorded announcements in Polish language. Retractable monitors with airshow map. Cabin crew courteous. Complimentary refreshment including choice of soft/alcoholic beverages (from December 1st this refreshment is no longer included in the price, only to Alma Ata and Seoul). They must have added rows as the seat pitch was quite limited. Both cabin and toilets clean. Boarding in Edinburgh, disembarkation in Prague through an airbridge. Great value for money, much cheaper than so called low-cost carriers.

### "flight almost completely empty"
I flew CSA Czech Airlines in December 2014 from PRG to ICN. The flight was almost completely empty so friendly check in staff were able to block a whole row of 4 just for me. The one A330 aircraft that CSA have on their fleet is leased from Korean Air. The inflight entertainment was good and a huge choice. The food was excellent, cabin crew hospitable and attentive. I would recommend CSA for this long haul service, but they only have 1 long haul route.

### CSA Czech Airlines customer review
After checking in at Paris Charles de Gaulle, they lost my bag. I am only in Prague for a short time and this has become a huge inconvenience. CSA Czech Airlines give you 50 euros to cover the items you missed - which barely covers toiletries and clothing, or a phone charger in a tourist city like Prague. Upon having the bag arrive in Prague, it took CSA Czech Airlines over 5 hours to deliver it to my hostel. When I called to ask about the progress, the customer service was extremely rude. I unfortunately have to fly back with them, but I will never fly with them in the future.

### CSA Czech Airlines customer review
Hamburg to Prague on ATR 72. Smiling crew drinks served 3 times small snack and milka for Valentine's Day and enough legroom. They also offer newspapers - on this flight only in Czech. The plane was noisier than A319 but better for my ears because of lower altitude. My luggage had 21 kgs and I didn't have any problem baggage claim in Prague took 10 min.

### CSA Czech Airlines customer review
OK 726 from Prague to Fiumicino on the small ATR42. Czech Airlines are sending you on this route in such a small plane and not in airbus which was in the schedule when we bought the ticket. I know they can change the plane but from Airbus 319 to small ATR 42 it is unbelievable. Very long flight. Noisy flight. Sorry but never again Czech Airlines.

### CSA Czech Airlines customer review
Flew to Madrid 11/1/2015 on CSA 701. Landed on time. Plane was older Boeing 737-700 owned by Smartwings airlines who operate for Csa. Everything inside was written in Hungarian. Very odd experience. Seats so close to each other that I could not move. Crew young and spoke English. Not CSA experience though expected it to be.

### CSA Czech Airlines customer review
Just flew return from Prague to Paris CDG and back. Both flights were slightly delayed but arrived almost on time. So far so good. Both flights were however not operated by CSA even though they have they code and I bought CSA. They are not using own planes but charter airlines planes of Travel service on this Paris route. So seat pitch was very tight as you can expect from charter planes. Slightly worn plane as well. I used to fly with CSA when they had own planes and it was more comfortable. Service is consisting of drinks and snack. Now on Paris route is only Air France or this charter plane of CSA. I will fly Air France next time.

### CSA Czech Airlines customer review
Flew with them on Prague to Malpensa Milan route and to my shock this flight has been operated by ATR 72 turboprop plane. Normally this flight will take a maximum one hour but with this plane it was 1 hour and 40 minutes. Very worn plane and noisy. I was telling to myself that I will never ever do this mistake. Good I bought only one way. There is lot of others flying big planes this route and I will stick to them next time. Otherwise water was provided few times by tired crew. They've been sorry but confirmed it is not rare lately as they put those slow small planes due to low passengers loads.

### CSA Czech Airlines customer review
We have just completed flights from Madrid to Prague and return both flights were bought on Czech Air web page and ticket says it is their flight but the flights were operated by to us unknown low cost airline Smartwings. I found this unacceptable to sell tickets and telling us it is full service flight but then flying low cost. We complained and were told by crew that Czech airlines is now part of this low cost airline. Plane was very tired and has very tight seat pitch. We were unhappy with this. Crew was good and drinks were offered for free. We suggest to be careful with Czech Airlines and check what you are buying.

### CSA Czech Airlines customer review
I booked a Czech Airlines flight from Prague to Dubai but it was actually operated by Smartwings (The Travel Service). I paid a lot more than if I had booked the same flight directly with Smartwings. The only difference between the two is that booking through Czech Airlines you automatically get 23Kgs baggage allowance whereas with Smartwings you get 15Kgs and have to buy extra. I found the Smartwings plane to have terrible leg room. I'm average height and my knees were brushing against the seat in front. The person behind must have been the same because when I tried to tilt my seat there was considerable resistance - the person's legs! The plane was clearly used for short haul flights but this was 5.5 hours and it was quite uncomfortable. There was a meal served which was good and the cabin crew were very jolly.

### CSA Czech Airlines customer review
I flew from Bratislava to Prague on a one-way flight last week. The flight itself was relatively short yet my ticket cost around 100 Euros which was slightly above what I would've chosen to pay. The flight was slightly late on departure yet it arrived on-time in Prague. Service on board was horrible only one drink offered and no snacks offered at all. The check-in was easy and went without any problems. Overall I expected more from Czech Airlines and I will only fly them again if necessary.

### CSA Czech Airlines customer review
A very quick hop from Prague to Warsaw and return. Ticket bought through my android mobile check in functional on both ways and working fine. Flights all on time. The leg to Warsaw was serviced by the older ATR72 showing their age and rather uncomfortable and loud with desperate need of a re-do. The return was the much newer ATR42 with comfortable interior and a welcomed change. Cabin crew professional and smiling. Nothing to complain about. LOT (the competitor) used Embraer jets thus handles this route in 50minutes compared to the turboprop ATR that flies between both cities in 90 minutes!

### CSA Czech Airlines customer review
I flew from Prague to Amsterdam we flew with the airbus A320-200. The crew were friendly and we had drinks served 3 times even though it was just a 1 hour flight the airplane was on time and we landed 10 minutes early. The cabin crew were helpful and there was a lot of leg room.

### CSA Czech Airlines customer review
ICN-PRG on A333. Lots of legroom. Flight crew were very good. It was a daytime flight and crew left a large bottle of water for everybody after breakfast was tidied up instead of doing drink runs. Meals were good and flights on time.

### CSA Czech Airlines customer review
What a pleasant surprise! We flew from Prague to Barcelona in April. There is more leg room in coach and they give out free surprisingly good sandwiches and your choice of beverage including beer and wine. The attendants were pleasant and professional and the plane ride was smooth.

### CSA Czech Airlines customer review
We took CSA for our PRG-BUD-PRG flight. Morning flight operated on time with little old-fashioned ATR 72. Although the flight was quite short the service was very good. We were offered biscuits and two rounds of drinks. Cabin crew OK. We arrived 15 minutes early at BUD. Flight back was operated with new ATR 42. Flight on-time cabin crew very friendly and we were offered biscuits again and even three rounds of drinks. At Prague we didn't wait for our luggage for more than 5 minutes. Very pleasant experience.

### CSA Czech Airlines customer review
Flew PRG-SVO (booked via Korean Air). Nice inflight magazine. They served hot food however vegetarian meal which was requested (on not confirmed on this flight - as they we supposed to serve 'snack' only) was not served. Sometimes less is more - if they only served a snack there would be no reason to complain. Decent amount and selection of non-alcoholic drinks beer and wine served thorough the flight. Cabin crew professional but without a smile.

### CSA Czech Airlines customer review
BRU-PGR-BRU: both flights on time sandwich and drinks for free on board very friendly crew.

### CSA Czech Airlines customer review
PRG-GVA really worth it flight on time drinks served 3 times on an hour flight! New aircraft nice entertainment you get really much more for less money.

### CSA Czech Airlines customer review
Warsaw-Prague-Warsaw on 10-13 Oct. Both on ATR planes. On time very friendly and professional crew zero attitude. Overall nice short flight.

### CSA Czech Airlines customer review
BUH-PRG-BRU and return. CSA is becoming a low cost airline although a member in sky team you get miles and status flights just in the expensive classes. With all the other sky team airlines I would get for the class I have travelled at lest 25% of the miles travelled with CSA you get 0 without being warned by the website when booking otherwise I would not have bought the ticket. All the flights were delayed BRU-PRG-BUH more than 1 hour landing in Bucharest 2.30 am. All in all not a pleasant experience.

### CSA Czech Airlines customer review
MXP-PRG-IEV (19/6) / MOW-PRG-MXP (27/8). Excellent overall service with choice of beverages. On longer flights (PRG-IEV and MOW-PRG) warm lunch/dinner served on shorter flights (MXP-PRG) only snacks and beverage. Wine and beer available on all flights. Very friendly staff. New planes on all sectors flown. Prague airport is small modern and clean excellent for short connections. Overall fare excellent value for money. Would surely recommend to others.

### CSA Czech Airlines customer review
PRG-BCN and back. I did online check in so no waiting at he airport. Flights were operated by CSA's new A330 with plenty of legroom and great IFE. Cabin crew very attentive nice and smiling at all times. Catering was standard as on all European flights. Consisted of caramel cookies and selection of soft drinks beer wine coffee and tea. Flight attendants did rounds offering water. Looking forward to my next flight with them.

### CSA Czech Airlines customer review
BCN-PRG-LED on 8th June. Early check-in was quick and efficient. Me and my wife were given 2 seats in a row upon request. As it was early flight snacks and drinks (beer included) were on offer on BCN-PRG leg. I had no complaints. Short stopover in Prague passed fine - huge terminals may offer many varieties how to spend 2 hours in shops or restaurants. Boarding was well organized and uneventful plane load was about 90%. PRG-LED leg flight time passed quick nice and attentive female FAs supplied us with hot meal snacks and red/white wine without any surcharge. Clean cabin with fairly good pitch and legroom also kept us in good mood. FAs speak four languages (Czech Russian English German) and were very polite and smiling. All in all nice flight. I would opt for CSA next time.

### CSA Czech Airlines customer review
TLV-PRG on 24th June. Very crowded plane. Old fashion not well maintained seats. The worst breakfast ever experienced. Please try an alternative whenever feasible.

### CSA Czech Airlines customer review
CSA flight Milan Prague started with a long line of more then 100 people waiting at check-in 2 hours before departures time - no information. Two poor girls handled one passenger every 10 minutes constantly mixing business and economy lines. After the last passenger was treated it was late for customs and security so we were forced to buy "fast track" at 10 Euros per person.

### CSA Czech Airlines customer review
Moscow-Prague-Moscow on my Bangkok to Prague trip. Czech airlines rarely let me down. The planes are new and clean fly on time and am adamant on thanking the young cabin crew for always making the flights more pleasant. They are attentive without being pushy. Love the airline's fresh hot bread (2x rounds) during food service and the numerable water/orange juice rounds through out the flight. Food tasty and fresh. Combined with how great Prague airport is makes my long flights from South East Asia less stressful. Now that they're starting to fly long haul I hope to see them flying direct to Bangkok.

Tel Aviv - Prague flight in Airbus A330-300. Far better than other two airlines on this route - El Al and Smartwings. Airplane was new and clean seats comfortable with excellent personal screens. Food was good as usual - no choice of two meals in the back of the aircraft. Flight crew attentive nice and walked through cabins regularly. Excellent flight.

Flight Dusseldorf to Prague normally takes 1 hour. In my case it took me about 18 hours. First flight was canceled second flight was delayed about 10 hours. No information about refreshment at the airport no vouchers no information about accommodation. I had to stay at the airport overnight without any information about future departure time of flight. Will never fly this airline again.

I flew one of CSA's new A330s to Seoul Incheon. Fantastic trip. AVOD in economy with large selection of movies and games. Food was excellent - choice between Korean bibimbap Czech chicken steak and Asian fried noodles. Airplane was new and clean. Staff was attentive had a drink service one every 30 minutes. The flight took off 20 minutes late bu arrived on time. Definitely comparable to Korean Air and KLM and perhaps better than Air France Delta Alitalia.

PRG-CDG. The flight was on time a fairly new A320/321 and the crew efficient and friendly. I did notice the seats were somewhat thinner than what I usually see but they were quite satisfactory.

### CSA Czech Airlines customer review
PRG-MAD-PRG. I was very satisfied again. PRG-MAD plane A321 - fully occupied but silent clean crew polite and helpful. For food just a tiny pack of crackers but good offer of beverages. MAD-PRG new A320 great plane. Crew wasn't very polite.

Flying from Paris to Odessa via Prague everything went particularly well. Flights were on time the crew was helpful and polite and I got my luggage without any problems. Furthermore the price was very cheap despite I booked my tickets less than a month before departure.

### CSA Czech Airlines customer review
AUH-PRG-AUH. The flights were good and on time crew were attentive. The seat in business class was rather new but dated design and not that comfortable. This is substandard seat even for a medium haul flight these days. The food was unacceptable. There was only cold food on the PRG-AUH flight. Even though it was a night flight there should be a choice of hot food. The guy in front of me had to ask an attendant to heat up his sandwiches. The airline allowed 24 hours internet check in but it was useless because there was no baggage drop-off point. You could really check in only a few hours prior to your flight at Prague airport CSA homebase? I will not fly with CSA again.

SXB-PRG on ATR 42 was smooth on time plane clean and tidy. No papers offered but small snack (crackers) hot/cold drinks or wine/beer served complimentary. Cabin crew patient with some Russian group with children who refused seat belting before landing. If there would be better deal on CSA (1 month before flight date) I would definitely opt for this airline.

BRU-PRG-BRU. Altogether very satisfied one flight with older 737 the other with new A319. Check in procedure was smooth and uncomplicated in both cases. The flight with A319 was very nice with inflight screens with maps. The flight with 737 was bit worse as it was an older plane. The food and drinks on both flights were quite well for nowadays standards on European flights. The crew both in plane and on ground very nice and helpful.

AMS-PRG-MSQ. AMS-PRG operated by CSA PRG-MSQ by B2. CSA flight from AMS to Prague was OK new plane comfortable seats although no food provided - only drinks and a tiny pack of crackers - a bad surprise if you've missed your breakfast. The crew were not smiling or willing to communicate reasons for a delay. Transfer in Prague airport was nightmarish: CSA apparently does not have any interactions with B2 and although the flight is codeshared B2 is handled by a different company and CSA refuses to help with making transfer happen even for a SkyPriority passenger - very disappointing.

PRG-CDG-PRG. New A320 with LCD showing the map professional cabin crew cold and hot drinks and snack. Load factor around 85%. Flight was on time. I'm a frequent flyer and I've to disagree with some comments - compared to other national carriers Czech are one of the best on European flights! I was really satisfied with this flight and I'll fly them again!

### CSA Czech Airlines customer review
Madrid via Prague to Vilnius. Flights on time. Cabin crew kind. Planes very old. Seating cramped especially on B737. No food at all. On 3 hrs flight from Madrid only a tiny pack of cheap crackers. They advertise meal/snack. On other airlines serving Madrid routes over 2 hours there is real food. Even on lunch time flight same tiny pack of crackers on Vilnius route. Lot of water though. Transfer on very empty airport in Prague was efficient. But again very overpriced food outlets so we were forced to spend money for low quality meals as we were hungry. I wanted to try CSA as some reports were positive but my real experience was different and will not repeat it in the future.

### CSA Czech Airlines customer review
Flying from Bangkok to Prague with the segment of Abu Dhabi flown by Czech airlines (rest is Etihad). Both flights were completely full with 85%+ and the return with 110%+ as some were bumped to C class. Its only a 6 hrs flight as usual a very comfortable flight good food and drinks. Check in at Prague a bit longer than should be due to the lack of a drop off for people who check in online. Ground staff courteous and it took no time and I had my boarding pass. Passport control was a breeze. The flight was close to midnight so many shops were closed. Going through security was OK. Id probably complain about a rather small gate area for these full flights so the hall filled up quite quickly and many were standing and a bit uncomfortable. Boarding came later and it eased it up but priority and C class passengers would have not been able to jump over the crowds to board. Its a red eye flight so no films are on just the flight route. The flights themselves were comfortable cabin crew courteous lots of drink rounds handling a fully booked flight.

### CSA Czech Airlines customer review
Flew in J last week PRG-CDG return and in both cases old plane was used with no business class seating available. Very old Boeing 737 with old repurchased Lufthansa seats used on the way to Paris with so little seat pitch that none of us could fit in and on return a charter configured A321 again without business class seat configuration and cabin class separation. Cabin crew very embarrassed about it in both cases and trying to do their best but having such a bad hard product they just can not made it up. C Class food also consisted of a very small snack which can easily be served in economy on other airlines. Not worth the price on any aspect.

### CSA Czech Airlines customer review
PRG - Tallinn. Very poor experience. CSA does not serve food on short flights - just crackers. Drink selection was very limited. Included wine but from one of the cheapest Czech brands. Recently CSA changed it's seats spacing so be prepared for very small space for your legs. IT's to the point of feeling jammed between seats. Flight was delayed by 50 minutes and CSA did not provide any assistance at the gate. CSA is worst then low- cost airlines.

Praha-Abu Dhabi-Praha. Check-in smooth. Prague's airport hassle free and user friendly (there is even a free cinema in the public area). The flight operated on a new/clean narrow body (A319) aircraft however the seats were comfortable enough for a six hour journey. Outstanding cabin crew assisting during boarding smiling and chatting with passengers. Pillow and quality blanket at disposal. Snack and rich breakfast served on the night flight and snack and tasty lunch served on the day return flight plus wide selection of soft/alcoholic beverages. Water distributed by FAs during the flight. Moving map screened on retractable monitors. Aircraft departed/arrived on time in both directions. I enjoyed the journey.

### CSA Czech Airlines customer review
Abu Dhabi to Prague. Clean airplane (A319) Blanket and pillow provided excellent staff surprisingly good food and many rounds of drinks. I was pleasantly surprised especially compared to the first leg (Bangkok to Abu Dhabi operated by Etihad) which flew old plane (Boeing 777-300er) and the service from cabin crew was almost non-existent.

### CSA Czech Airlines customer review
Flying CSA several times a year to various destinations. Friendly and professional cabin crew. Good meals on longer flights (may not be to everyone's taste but it's real food rather than tasteless synthetic stuff) snacks only on short ones. Good choice of free beverages in economy class including tomato juice wine and beer. Many code-sharing flights including non-Skyteam airlines sometimes offering a lower price than the actual flight operator.

Copenhagen to Prague return. Both on time same kind of aircraft good seating for economy. CSA makes fuss about serving free meals we flew early at 7 o'clock and expected something. Tea coffee and a tiny piece of cake was the meal. On the return at 17.00 hours we received a packet of crackers and nothing else.

MAD-PRG PRG-KSC. MAD-PRG: A320. Boarding was adequate. Boarding was on time. The aircraft was clean seats comfortable and inflight programme was only moving map and some SkyTeam trailers.

Bangkok-Prague-Bangkok return (BKK-AUH operated by Etihad codeshare). Surpassed my expectations and agree with many reviews below. Flights on time a late night (midnight) flight to the Middle east. Business Class 80% full and Economy around the same. Flight very comfortable in new clean aircraft with pleasant interiors. No amenity kit but pillows and covers for all passengers. Cabin crew young and mainly females. Food was terrific many drink rounds with water and orange juice and free alcohol cabin crew presence frequent. Overhead LCDs showing map. The flight back was the same slight delay waiting for connecting Business class passenger but we landed on time. Return flight at 2am so the same sleep after food and landing in Prague in the morning. Bathroom amenities excellent for Economy class.

Tel Aviv-Prague-Tel Aviv. On the first flight I asked for a pillow and experienced quite a rude answer from the air-hostess after she had forgotten about it and I reminded her politely. Food was cold bread hard and no entertainment offered on a 4 hours journey. On the return waited in line at check-in over an hour - rude air-hostesses and same thing with food being cold and bread hard and no entertainment at all.

MAD-PRG on A319 plane. Everything from check-in to arrival was great. Staff at check-in counter accommodated my friend and I with emergency exit seats. Plane was clean and comfortable. Onboard flight attendants were pleasant providing courteous and professional service. Sufficient drink runs were made and call requests responded to swiftly. A drawback was that no catering was offered not even a purchase option for a near 3 hour journey.

### CSA Czech Airlines customer review
MAD-PRG-TXL return. Modern aircraft on PRG-MAD legs (A320) and reasonably new ATR42 on PRG-TXL. Plenty of legroom even in economy professional and friendly crews catering nothing outstanding however plenty of drinks to choose from including wine. Using PRG as a transfer airport is more than a pleasant experience: the airport is not too big and ok makes even very tight connections of 15 minutes or less sometimes. However if you loose your connecting flight they will provide food or a hotel for the day. Prices are fair even on a short notice you might get good deals.

MXP-PRG A320 Business Class. The problem both times I flew them from Milan were check-in staff - not CSA staff. Both times only one line open for economy passengers no business class until just before close time. Staff at business class counter extremely unfriendly. This time refused to check in my luggage all the way to JFK. No reason for it no explanation. My luggage never arrived.

Abu Dhabi to Prague. Since its a new flight the plane was half empty. Flight with a narrow body A319 crisp clean plane with nice new 2-2 seats. The flight was smooth crew courteous without being too invasive. Food delicious and plenty of drink rounds with water and juice. Seat pitch and legroom generous and flying with a smaller airline gave the flight a sense of privacy and not being in a plane crammed like a market place.

### CSA Czech Airlines customer review
Prague to Madrid return both flights on the A320. The CSA Airbus fleet is quite modern with good seats adjustable headrests and decent legroom. Nothing out of the usual but a good experience for flights within Europe. Even though the outbound flight was completely full check-in at PRG was quick as was the check-in at MAD T4 on the return with only a minute of waiting time. Both flights were on time with fast baggage retrieval in Prague (15 mins from plane to airport exit). A cold snack - sandwich or tortilla - was served in Economy with multiple drink options. Both crews were friendly and professional offering water throughout the flight. There's no individual IFE but scattered LCD screens show the flight details throughout the journey. All in all it borders on the impossible to get to the advertised promotional fares but CSA still provides a good value.

PRG-MXP return. They have efficient clean and quiet planes. Customer service on board is next to none and they still offer food in most parts. I transfer my US flights via PRG - much easier than CDG or AMS. One thing that I would criticize the airline for is the lack of routes. When I asked the staff they were perplexed about it as well. Crew/planes/airport - great.

Amsterdam to Sofia via Prague return. Amsterdam-Prague return flights were with comfortable and new A320s equipped with overhead monitors featuring a flight map and a useful transfer video for Prague airport. The Prague- Sofia return flights were on older 737-500s which were nevertheless clean and comfortable enough. Legroom on all planes was good staff was polite and helpful. Food was delicious. Definitely a good value for money.

### CSA Czech Airlines customer review
We arrived at CDG with 2 hrs to spare to find a huge line waiting to be checked-in. With 150 people waiting in line to get on the plane there were only 4 attendants checking people in at a very slow pace. After 1.5hrs waiting to be checked-in we dropped our bags and boarded the plane which was delayed 20min. We discovered our seats were not together so we had to play musical chairs. Our flight left 45min later than scheduled it was blamed on the plane arriving later than anticipated. Upon arrival to PRG we found that one of our bags had been lost. Being the last flight of the evening we were left without a bag for the remaining 10 days of our trip.

Samara-Prague-Paris and Samara-Prague-Barcelona. 2 baggage losses simply outrageous - when I was traveling to Paris I was supposed to stay there for 6 months and when they lost my baggage I had only the clothes that were actually on me at the moment. I had my baggage back only 2 weeks after. Don't expect the representatives to react to your claims you're going to be politely ignored. Now I'm in Barcelona and was supposed to go to the Pyrenees to ski but they lost my baggage again and all my sportswear is in there. It may seem like good value but you risk too much and if they lose your baggage you're gonna pay the difference you'd pay for a flight with a different airline. So as you might guess I do not recommend this airline.

ATR72 cabin a little bit worn out but clean. Legroom better than on Airbus aircraft. Complimentary refreshments served. Crew courteous and smiling.

FRA-PRG-TLV return. CSA offers very competitive fares to TLV. Check in in FRA took a little time since only 2 counters open. A319 seats a little slim and not very comfy. Small sweet or salty snack and drinks served on this short sector. IFE was overhead LCD screens showing CSA commercials and map. Connecting in PRG very easy. Airport nice look out for a brochure with coupons for the airport restaurants. CSA offers upgrades for appox 40 EUR to business class (subject to have a high economy booking class or a frequent flyer status). PRG-TLV was full on A320. Seats not very comfy and felt quite cramped. Served a small hot meal and not very good. TLV to FRA they were overbooked and offered to rebook me to a direct El Al flight which I accepted. Check in staff at TLV very friendly and efficient. I would fly Czech Airlines again if the price is low the product is nothing special but they did the job and flights were on time.

LHR-PRG-RIX-PRG-LHR. Flights on time. Crew smiling and helpful. Free drinks and sandwiches on which is more than can be said for most European airlines now. Flights on 737s which feel cramped when full. My only gripe was with Prague airport - nothing to do and horrendously expensive! (£4 for a small glass of orange juice in every cafe! £55 in 'duty free' shops for most fragrances! ).

### CSA Czech Airlines customer review
Our flight Prague to Madrid (A319) was badly delayed supposedly due to a last-minute crew replacement. The staff started issuing new boarding passes at the gate effectively scrapping the passengers' seating preferences but they were unable to provide any information on the delay. After about 70 minutes at the gate the airline let everyone on board just to keep them waiting for another 2 hours. This seems to be CSA's favorite way of avoiding passenger rights claims as it automatically falls within 'tarmac delay' - people on board only got a glass of water while waiting. The crew never said anything about the actual cause of the delay and didn't seem to care much about it. The inflight snack consisted of the usual ham and cheese sandwich a cold and a hot drink. The arrival to MAD was further delayed by about 30 minutes while waiting in the landing stack meaning that we missed our connection even though we'd originally had 4 hours for transfer within the same terminal. The flight back (MAD-PRG) two weeks later was substantially better: a newer A319 on time and with a friendly crew (although their language skills remain disappointing). The seats in more recent narrowbody aircraft are decent with adjustable headrests and sufficient legroom. Inflight snacks keep to the same standard (small chicken sandwich drinks) the entertainment system only has a few LCD screens throughout the plane showing the flight details occasional video clips and a very very dated presentation of Prague. All in all the experience was more pleasant than the previous trip and the ground staff has been very helpful in locating and retrieving my lost baggage upon arrival.

MAN-PRG return B737-400 Economy. On time departures / early arrivals in both directions. Both directions almost full - encouraging given that CSA pulled off the route at the start of the recession and only came back this Spring.

PRG-MAD-PRG Being native Czech I prefer Czech airlines if possible. Unfortunately due to economic situation they started to cut down all expenses including onboard service and even cancelling some of the routes. The food a sandwich was nothing you would remember but was edible. IFE poor as only some old clips were shown - watching the position of the aircraft on the map was much better. Soft drinks complimentary. Airplane quite new and clean.

Marseille-Prague-Marseille Economy class. Sandwiches offered both ways were fresh and tasty. Cabin crew spoke good English and heavily accented French were professional and engaged with passengers. Other people's comments about poor seats were borne out by people around me though mine were fine. Good legroom. Whereas I don't think I would choose them to go on to another destination after Prague for a simple round trip I'd certainly recommend them.

Prague to London economy. I checked in online the day before travel. The process of online check in is ok not as easy or user friendly as BA or Star Alliance (LX LH). At least it’s available. Prague airport empty and very easy to navigate. However if you arrive early there is nothing worth seeing/buying at the whole airport. Everything is overpriced. Used the CSA lounge which is nothing special. Very poor choice of food and drinks. A320 seat pitch adequate. Food was pretty tasteless. On Economy class you have to purchase wine/beer. Service on board was very robotic but ok for a short flight. Arrived at Heathrow T4. Same nightmare as usual. Very long wait after landing due to traffic control. Luggage belt area was very crowded and messy. One positive thing about CSA is their quick response to email. I had few queries on my FFP card and all was resolved within 20 minutes on 3 exchange of emails. Very efficient and friendly. However CSA ticket price is the most expensive in most routes including Prague to London. In the future I would opt for easyjet for the low price or BA for the quality of product of service.

FRA-PRG-TLL. Morning flight FRA-PRG delayed for over an hour. Missed connection to Tallin in PRG. Over 60 mins standing and waiting in line at the transfer desk in Prague to then find out that the only option to get to Tallin would arrive in Tallin at midnight. No apologies no offering of compensation highly "uninspired" staff. Flying CSA is also like flying in the 80s : the machines are probably 20-30 years old with broken arm rests being fixed with duck-tape. Not to be recommended.

### CSA Czech Airlines customer review
TLL-BRU connection in PRG. Economy. Each and every flight was delayed +/- an hour. First of all my flight from Tallinn got delayed about 50 minutes because of de-icing. When we arrived in Prague I only had 10 minutes to catch my flight. I only barely made it thanks to not having to pass any security checks anymore. That flight was delayed as well and I arrived in Brussels an hour later than planned. On the way back my flight from Brussels was delayed over an hour so I missed my connection in Prague. So I had to stand in line for another hour to get my tickets exchanged. Of course there were no other direct flight to Tallinn so they gave me one through Helsinki. At least I got to travel in business class because economy was full. Then my flight from Prague was delayed AGAIN and I missed my connection in Helsinki AGAIN. So I had to stand in line once more (another hour) to exchange my tickets wait an hour for the flight to Tallinn which was also (of course) delayed about 50 minutes. In conclusion I spent my entire day in 4 different airports and got to Tallinn 8 hours later than I was supposed to. And with a headache from all the standing in lines in poorly air conditioned airports.

One way flight from Prague to Munich. The flight was early in the morning with an ATR42. Check in was a bit chaotic at the beginning.. sort of a rush hour and the new "check in for all Czech airlines flights" system that I am not very keen of but I have to admit that its a saving factor for the airline. More check in counters opened 20-25min from my arrival. I guess knowing their bottle neck times all check ins should have been ready. But all in all it took me around 25minutes to check in. Czech airlines check in kiosks were all over with ladies helping those who didn't know how but the line for the baggage drop was as well full. Beware Czech airlines will not let you with even 900g of extra weight! The check in agent was polite and helped that I took one of the fairly larger bags with me onboard (around 10kg) so I kind of wonder of the logic as I had a back pack and this bag with me. Passport control quick. Czech airlines has a fairly large fleet of turboprop ATR42s however I caught one of two older generation so the interior even though clean showed its age and older design. The cabin crew did their job looking at the fact that this was a very short hop. Security demonstration English Czech and German as well as newspapers in all these languages. Captain talked to us explaining de-icing and 5 minutes delay. A small sandwich and free (juices and water tea and coffee). I love Czech airlines but a reason for taking a star away is having to pay for coca cola beer and wine on their flights. CSA was known for impeccable service and plenty of food and drinks. Saving on visible things like food and drinks make a difference. Good value for money but have to monitor how much is CSA cutting in service - afraid it will come in line with other "sit shut up till we arrive" kind of airlines that we see today

Barcelona-Istanbul with connection in Prague. Excellent value for money all flights arrived on time or early and friendly and helpful staff. A320 between Barcelona and Prague and return was clean comfortable with excellent legroom and a bit of IFE on overhead screens food same old sandwich and very limited free beverage service (only one round and a very stingy one) however. A bit too many announcements from the flightdeck for my taste. 737-400 between Prague and Istanbul and be aware that these aircraft seem to have a third substandard class which starts halfway down the economy section and features narrower seats and less legroom than the economy seats up front. I´m not sure if these are for passengers who have paid cheaper fares but I was seated in this area on PRG-IST but on the return flight I was seated closer to the front and was much more comfortable. Passengers who have booked business class on this aircraft should know that the first row in Business class located right behind the bulkhead features considerably less legroom than in economy. Prague airport is not my favourite but all connections were smooth and CSA staff were very helpful. On the return I only had 40 minutes between flights but I managed to get to the gate unhurried with time to spare. Will look into them again in the future.

Bucharest to Amsterdam via Prague. Booked in economy; frequent flyer upgrade to business class on PRG - AMS leg. Czech Airlines are OK though not as good as they were a few years ago. Their model is a hybrid of full service airline and low cost. The pressure on their prices if obvious with only charter airline quality food and drinks available free in economy class. The main problem I encountered was changing planes in Prague. Prague airport has simply not worked out how to be an efficient hub. Connections between Schengen and non-Schengen zones in particular are a pain as the airport is rather sprawling. As there was a 50 minute delay to the OTP-PRG leg I had 15 minutes connection which I only made by a lot of running and some fairly shameless pushing in front of queues. Only 2 passport booths were open and these were monopolised by a group of Russian school children. CSA are fine but beware tight connections in Prague. If your incoming flight is late neither CSA nor Prague airport will help you expedite the process; you're on your own and don't get priority in any queues. The result is extremely stressful. CSA are as good as any other airline for point-to-point travel at reasonable costs and onboard service can be very good but beware connections.

IST to BCN via Prague return in Business Class. Outbound from Istanbul to Prague was good service on A320 with easy connection in Prague to Barcelona on A320 - good service with average business class seating. On the return segment we checked in for the flight and assigned seats 2a and c. When we boarded the aircraft we realized they had a change of aircraft to an A321. Problem with this plane is that it is only a charter aircraft with no business class. Small seat no legroom and I paid extra for this. The connection in Prague was to a B737-400 which was very old and badly in need of a new interior. Crew was nice but again cabin comfort horrible for a business class. As a Platinum member with Delta I was shocked to find that my miles did not credit to my account. When I contacted Delta they said to contact Czech Airlines. When I contact Czech Airlines I spoke with a very combative person on the phone who said this was a Delta problem and they could do nothing. A bad experience and had other issues with Czech with the overall service and the extremely rude 3rd party staff they have contracted in Barcelona.

Still I made the flight as the plane waited a few extra minutes for us connecting passengers. Also my luggage was on the same plane! Impressive. Otherwise standard service: sandwich and non-alcoholic drinks for free pleasant planes. Will fly them again.

TXL-JFK via Prague return. I have flown often with Czech in Europe which is a decent experience and thought I would try them transatlantic. Terrible idea. Worst business class I have ever experienced. The seats are worse than premium economy on BA or SAS - uncomfortable poor pitch poor recline etc. The entertainment system consisted of an ipod with four films loaded on - the volume on the headphones was too low to hear anything. I tried three different ipods on the two transatlantic flights with no luck. Other than that the decor is tired toilets not kept clean during the flight. The only positive is that the crew are polite but for this one doesn't pay business class fares.

Helsinki - Prague one way. Aircraft modern and clean. Enough legroom flight was about 2/3 full so there were plenty of empty seats. FAs professional and polite. One sandwich and a glass of juice was for free.

RIX-PRG-JFK and back. Riga to Prague and back ok. Aircraft comfy staff friendly. But planes to New York are with very poor entertainment system. Expected good entertainment system thought will watch movies or listen to music in the plane. But there was nothing to listen to just few channels of music and nothing acceptable. No TV sets for every passenger. They showed old movies and stupid "funny" short movies. The flight was long as well - about 9 hours.It wasn't night flight so I also didn't want to sleep that much. This airline company is ok if you fly in Europe but they should think more about entertainment system for flights across the ocean.

LHR-PRG-LHR Economy. Flight on time plane not full so good seating choices. Checked in online and worked well. FA's friendly and attentive snacks served followed by items to be bought - paid for wine but no problem. Quick exit at Prague airport. Return flight plane also not full and FA's friendly. Food served and items sold. At Prague you can upgrade to Business (if you have the right class ticket).

CGN-PRG-IST. CGN-PRG aged and not well kept ATR 42. When weighting the hand luggage the CSA employees claimed that the allowed baggage was 8 kilos not 12 as stated at their website. Some passengers were already sorting out some of the luggage. Later the women checked the flight details again and admitted that the hand baggage is 12 kg. Cabin crew did not speak German and only poor english although most passengers were non-czech. Only a small sandwich was handed out unfortunately the cabin crew did not know whether the meat included pork or not - the vast majority of the passengers were Turkish so almost no one could eat the sandwich (no vegetarian alternative provided). Prague airport was nice and the three hours of waiting were enjoyable. An old Boeing used for the flight to Turkey. Seats were not clean. This time a bigger sandwich provided including one free drink. I felt like flying with a low cost carrier.

Our direct flight Toronto - Prague was cancelled however the web site said it was on time about 3 hours before the planned departure - we live 15 min. from the airport (the plane never left Prague so they knew for at least 8 hours). We were offered to fly direct 2 days later or be put on any available non-direct flight. We were not informed at the time and only found out later that we had to wait for 8 hours in Amsterdam for the connecting flight to Prague. No food/drink vouchers were offered. In Amsterdam we tried to book earlier flight but were told that it could not be done for security reason because our luggage was already booked to Prague (there was much earlier flight to Prague - at 9 am we landed at 7 am and had to wait until almost 3 pm!). We had a similar experience with a different airline last year (10 hours delay) and we received EU 40 in food vouchers and Can$ 150 for future travel each. We will avoid flying with CSA in the future.

BUD-PRG-MAD return. Had good experience with them ground crew screwed up in BUD so we were late by about 1hr CSA held back all the planes that had connecting pax from BUD. Very nice of them (though I'm sure others were annoyed by delay)! BUD-PRG in an ATR42 was good for an experience PRG-MAD both ways in a clean A320 with one of the best inflight meals I've ever had. PRG-BUD served by Malev. CSA had a great price for the money at the time I bought the ticket.

MAN-PRG. Generally a pleasant flight almost full in an ageing but clean Boeing 737. Good information from cockpit in both English and Czech. Cabin crew are good but looked fed up. Catering has gone downhill since my last CSA flight and the sandwich was stale. Flight was 5 minutes late but bags were on the belt very quickly.

Similar experience to Michal Matejka below Amsterdam - Prague flight parked at non-Schengen gate which resulted in long bus trips around the airport. Return Brno - Amsterdam via Prague connection was very tight (40 minutes) and further delayed by another security check at Prague. Don't understand why this couldn't be done once and for all in Brno - is security there not acceptable for international flights? Annoying to have to pay for food and beverages considering €600+ fare - surely free beer can be offered?

Stockholm to Prague was OK nothing to complain about. Sandwich not the best but not the worst either. Don't understand why they serve coffee and tea together with the sandwich instead than returning after a while but that's not a big issue. The return was very disappointing. I travelled with my husband and we had only one checked luggage weighing 22 kilos one piece of cabin luggage and my purse. We had to pay the 2 kilos overweight because we had two separate bookings! The check-in lady told us that she has to follow the (Austro- Hungarian) rules and she doesn't want to lose her job. We replied that she will for sure when the customers will choose other companies.

CDG-PRG-EVN return. Way in no problem except that all beverages are no more free. On the way back 2 hours delay in Yerevan and CSA managed rerouting perfectly in PRG. The plus for CSA : 6 flights a week for EVN skilled and fair english speaking staff. Best prices from France to Armenia. Transit in PRG is far easier than in many Paris metro stations. The minus: a problem with some goods purchased on board. No more agency in EVN you have to phone to headquarters in PRG.

Amsterdam to Prague. This once-preferred airline with above average quality of services has come to its decline and no longer deserves the 3 star rating. The airline has recently jumped on the bandwagon of paid onboard refreshments. Although I generally do not fully understand this tactics of many major airlines nowadays to make their customers to pay "major" airfare for low cost services I do not completely object to paying some extra for beer or wine onboard - provided that the prices are decent (which is true with CSA) and provided I have chance to get what I desire. The latter is unfortunately not true with CSA - even though I was willing to pay for a can of beer the attendant said that beer will be provided "by a colleague" who was however serving the rows in front of me and never made it to my row. It is quite difficult to understand the logic behind this. After arrival to Prague the aircraft parked at Terminal 1 (non-Schengen flights) which meant that although the airbridge came to the aircraft we only entered it and then we were forced to go out and take stairs to the apron to board the bus which took us to Terminal 2 (Schengen flights). This is a notorious problem at the Prague airport which the airline has be unable to resolve for 3 years (since opening of the terminal 2). The flight crew is supposed to inform the passengers in advance of this Prague "special" but no one bothered to do that on my flight.

LHR-PRG-LHR in Economy. Polite staff even at check-in! I speak reasonable Czech but overheard good English being spoken with other passengers. Can't comment on other language skills. Clean and comfortable seats with adequate legroom. Below-average food but still edible - I've had far worse. They aren't the cheapest but in my opinion still offer an acceptable service for the price.

Brussels- Prague-Cairo return. When you fly a low cost carrier you get what you paid for and that's no problem. When you fly a regular carrier you could expect a "normal" service. I thought CSA wasn't a low cost carrier because their fares aren't that low. I was wrong. CSA gives low cost services (no free soft drinks no free beer no vegetarian food as asked) for regular fares. They only want to take from their clients and don't want to give service in return. The low cost mentality and this for a star alliance member.

### CSA Czech Airlines customer review
An unexpectedly superb flying experience. Easy check-in without a queue in sight generous leg room especially on the return leg decent economy food (hot pastries) a free newspaper and friendly and helpful FAs. Couldn’t have been better. Well done Czech Airlines.

### CSA Czech Airlines customer review
I have flown on CSA many times on the route Tallinn-Prague-Berlin. They were never the cheapest option but they always stood for quality transportation and customer care. Well no longer so: Since 15th February CSA has quietly reduced service for economy passenger in a way that puts them just one step ahead of low cost/low service carriers like Air Baltic or Easyjet. They still offer one small sandwich and one non alcoholic beverage. If you want to drink more or have a wine you must pay for it. In addition they have nearly doubled the fees for excess baggage and have adopted a strict zero tolerance policy: If you have more than 20 Kilos you pay. In the past they were a bit lenient. CSA just forgot to lower the prices. So they are like low cost carriers servicewise but like full service airlines when it come to the ticket price. It is sad to see the decline of yet another one good airline.
