### "cancelled in last minute"
Transaero Airlines flight has been cancelled in last minute. I have booked round trip, and got cancelled both trip from Moscow to Istanbul and Istanbul to Moscow. Never experienced this problem before. All my plan have to change and cancel.

### "do not expect smiles"
The only good thing about Transaero Airlines is that seats are comfortable and the price is competitive. There was no IFE, and Moscow-Phuket is 11 hours. The food was terrible, there is no alcohol allowed on the flights, you can't even pay for it! There's water, Sprite and juice. Cabin service is efficient at best, but do not expect smiles. On the ground it's ten times worse - we weren't listed on the flight for the last leg of our Phuket-Tel Aviv flight. It took them 1.5 hours to correct it, and then I was given four boarding passes, none of them next to each other. We were travelling with two young girls! The ground crew shrugged their shoulders. I had to ask the passengers who would switch so I could sit with 3-year old, that's how useless they were. I would never fly them again. All flights were late (30-90 minutes) with no explanation given.

### "absence of simple customer care"
Flight from Milan to Moscow was delayed more than 6 hours with no explanation (already it was 2 hours on the way in). Arrival in Moscow by night around 5am instead of expected 10.30pm the day before, with all the associated problems. Complete absence of simple customer care and compensation. Bad behaviour of ground Transaero staff (and airport staff as well) which got angry at people because they complained. I'd better go by foot than fly again with this company.

### "delays without any reason"
Food is horrible. Served the same rice in breakfast and lunch. Soft drinks are served without ice. No alcoholic drinks served in economy class with or without payment. Flight delays without any reason. No compensation for delay even if it is more than 5-6 hours. In-Flight entertainment in Russian language.

### Transaero Airlines customer review
Our flight from VIE-Delhi was alright. An immense 15 hrs waiting time for the connecting flight though. Service is minimal, food is minimalistic. Our flight back from Delhi was actually ok. The AC seems extreme, the food was more in quantity but less in quality. Our 10 hrs for the connecting flight back to Vienna turned out to be 13 hrs. Almost every flight was delayed 2.5 up to 4 hrs. This airport aims for "international", however the amount of people in the shops and food courts who speak English is almost zero. Please, Transaero, improve your quality.

### Transaero Airlines customer review
A long check in line at Domodedovo airport in Moscow. Flight was delayed for 3 hours while the plane B767 was repaired. Inside the plane was a small distance between the seats. The ticket price was very cheap so I cannot complain. Food service was only water with cookies and there was no entertainment system.

### Transaero Airlines customer review
I was on a short hop from Kiev to Moscow. They called it discount class flight. The price tag was well over what Aeroflot and other legacy carriers asked but I needed to be late night at Domodedovo so bought it. The check in was polite but was informed about recent hand baggage rules change: they demanded to pack my backpack into a hold bag and to proceed to a plane with laptop bag only. When onboard was shocked with the seat pitch. Ryanair looks generous after that overcrowded accommodation. You have literally no room to seat plus passengers can recline leaving you no room even to move. The snack service was pathetic with peace of bread in plastic. Crew were polite but not up to other airlines standards. The plane was old. The toilet was smelly. Deplaning in Moscow was via bus. I used to be their loyalty program active user so accumulated some miles. Trying to used them I was unable to book reward ticket via website. This option leads you to a error message on the payment page. Overall overpriced and substandard. Not recommended.

Jan 2015. From TLV-VKO-ALA / TSE-VKO-TLV. All flights on B737-800 but the last flight to TLV onboard B767-300. Food is really pathetic I'm usually not picky with airline food but this time all 4 segments were awful in quantity and quality. Flight attendant mostly nice and accommodating. The flight from VKO to ALA was on a brand new B737-800 with IFE and WIFI so it was much fun all the rest 3 segments were without IFE. Seats are leather and quite comfortble. Flights departed mostly on time despite de-icing in every station but TLV. Fare was good VKO airport new and welcoming. All in all a good deal.

### Transaero Airlines customer review
I flew from FCO to VKO and back. The plane was a relatively new 737-800. Seats had a surprising amount of legroom. Both flights were on time but one of them used a bus instead of a jetway. No IFE but the flight was 3.5 hours so it wasn't a problem. Food was decent. Both flights were on time.

### Transaero Airlines customer review
PEK-VKO-TLV-VKO-PEK flew with a premium economy seat. Online check-in was a bit painful due to age old software but the airline staff at the counter were excellent to resolve the issue and made a smooth check-in for us and offered an emergency exit seat. I knew before hand about the poor in-flight entertainment so I carried an iPad with several movies and music in it. Cabin crew were on par with other airlines and spoke very little English which wasn't an issue at all. No wine or alcohol being served in the cabin but the generous flow of fruit juices candies and chocolates made my travel bit comfortable. I would definitely fly them again.

### Transaero Airlines customer review
LAX to VKO and back in premium economy class. No inflight entertainment (unless you are willing to pay $40-50 for portable player) and no duty free shopping. Water is not served often only two time during 11 hr flight. Restrooms were gross. The flight from Moscow was even worse. The check-in line was insane since it was the check in line for all the passengers flying to the USA (LA NYC and Miami). Also the flight was delayed about 3 hr. The airline didn't bother communicating this information to the passengers the screen at the airport was showing boarding during the whole time. Some passengers behavior was very uncivilized. Cheap ticket - cheap service. Planes are very old.

### Transaero Airlines customer review
Was sold a premium economy seat for the first leg of my journey (Beijing to Moscow) but when boarding noticed that I had been allocated an economy seat. After enquiring with one of the stewards was told that there are no premium economy seats on that flight.

### Transaero Airlines customer review
LHR-VKO-LHR. Outbound delayed for over 3 hours next to no information given as to why. On board truly miserable service the 'food' was almost tossed out and accompanied by soft drinks only. After clearing the food no further sign of the crew until landing. Return leg was an almost empty plane but service still at best robotic with only one drinks run in the 4 hour flight. If this is 'most improved' on the skytrax rankings I shudder to think what it was before. Go with easyjet to Russia you may have to pay for food and drinks but you can at least choose something edible and have a more pleasant experience.

16.10.2014 Yekaterinburg to Bangkok. Our flight was scheduled at 0.40 AM in the morning and it was delayed to 1.20 AM due to late arrival of airplane from Bangkok. We found seats very tight my husband is 1.80m tall and he struggled to move. Impossible to stretch his legs at all. Food was alright nothing spectacular. Cabin staff work well but not one of them speaks English - if not for my help my English speaking husband would not able to ask for a glass of water. There is no entertainment for foreigners - only movies in Russian. No individual PTV screens only big screens hanging from the ceiling therefore you can not select a movie. Was very hot in the cabin. In general flight was okay got us to Bangkok main problem was the tight seats.

### Transaero Airlines customer review
I have flown for over 50 years and have been to more than 60 countries this is the worst airline I have ever flown on. The gate attendant asked us to give up our seats (window aisle and aisle seats) for a family wanting to sit together and if we did they would upgrade us. To our surprise our new seats were in the middle of the middle row at the back of the plane. The inflight entertainment computer left me with little foot room while blowing hot air on my feet. The IFE for everyone on the flight was out of order. All food and beverages (other than coffee or tea) was room temp. Only one alcoholic beverage (wine only) for the flight was allowed this was served with your dinner. No ice for drinks. I tried to move to one of the last two rows (18 seats) that were empty but I was not allowed due to fact that 4 flight attendants were sleeping. The flight attendants locked the bathroom by the galley for their own use. The other bathrooms ran out of toilet paper and degraded into something worse than a porta john after an outdoor concert on a 100 degree day. After some time a flight attendant brought 2 rolls of TP for 6 bathrooms and gave the rolls to the last person in line. The flight attendants somehow could not understand English if you asked a question but they could speak English if they demanded something from you.

### Transaero Airlines customer review
My LH flight VKO-FRA (continuing to VIE) was cancelled and so I was rebooked on Transaero on a direct flight to VIE. Had low expectations but was totally caught by surprise when I entered the pretty new 737-800: Their C-class is a real C-class with 2-2 seat configuration perfect seat pitch lunch menu and utmost pleasant and friendly service. I took Japanese rolls as a starter and a grilled seabass as main course. Food looked appealing and tasted delicious. Entertainment was low but on a 3 hours flight not an issue - at least not for me. Will be definitely an option for future flights to Moscow and beyond.

### Transaero Airlines customer review
I booked a flight LED-DME-PKC and back. When I arrived to the airport there was a huge lane and I almost missed my flight as check-in was as fast as 1 person per 15 minutes and the staff was unfriendly and was not speaking English at all. During the first flight one cracker and that's it staff unfriendly as well. Transfer on DME quite ok but during the 85 hour flight there was no entertainment as the screens were not working. Food was surprisingly above average but the staff was not speaking English again. Flight back was really terrible no entertainment and as there was light outside you could not sleep either. The food this time was disgusting and cold and staff (again) not speaking English. After arrival (1 hour late) my connecting flight was supposed to leave in 50 minutes. When I came to the gate which was switched 3 times until I've finally got to the right one the flight was for unknown reasons delayed 30 minutes.

### Transaero Airlines customer review
Prior to this trip I had only ever used Aeroflot or Korean Air to reach Vladivostok from the USA and vice versa. As this trip was university-related and was paid for by my Russian university they naturally bought the cheapest tickets possible-Transaero. The trip from Vladivostok to Moscow was on a relatively new 777 with good personal IFE and decent food with reasonable legroom. When I arrived in Moscow I expected the Moscow-New York flight to be even better than the domestic flight. Boy was I wrong. The plane from Moscow-Vnukovo to NY-JFK was an old 767 with no personal IFE. The one plus side was a lot of leg room but it was a long flight with no IFE and rude staff. The return trip to Moscow was pretty much the same but when we arrived in Moscow and switched airports there was a slight problem. They had accidentally deleted our group from their flight manifest! We showed them the e-tickets and out boarding passes from the previous flights. They re-booked us on the same flight and gave us a free upgrade for their mistake which was nice. the flight back to Vlad was great with great IFE and food. Overall not bad for the price but I still will use Korean Air for my personal journeys back and forth from Vladivostok to the USA.

### Transaero Airlines customer review
St Petersburg-Moscow DME on board of a B733. Flight left and arrived on time. Cabin was clean and in good condition. FA's did their job but as usual in Russia don't expect a smile. Got tea and a cookie but what would you expect on a one hour flight. Overall Transaero is a reasonable Airline in my opinion and I would fly them again on domestic flights in Russia.

### Transaero Airlines customer review
Flights from St Petersburg to Moscow are now from the Pulkovo New Terminal. Comfort Lounge (business lounge not available) is awful. It's worse than regular space. No food no beverages (only water and coca cola). Dirty chairs only instant coffee.

### Transaero Airlines customer review
I flew this airline from JFK to Moscow and the flight was terrible. We got the same food for breakfast lunch and dinner and it was meat with rice that was 2 out of the 3 times cold. The flight stewardess barely knew English and the bathroom was filthy but again it was the cheapest option.

### Transaero Airlines customer review
I frequently fly LA-Moscow and back so Transaero UN 557/558 is the best option in my opinion: it is a direct flight and the cheapest one taking into account it is only 12 hours long.

### Transaero Airlines customer review
JFK to Moscow flight 2222 on May 19. Return flight 1111 on June 10. Outstanding service! Provided wonderful accommodations including blankets socks free head sets mouthwash and more. The food was good and they do not charge for wine (as no airline should). The big plus was that the temperature onboard was very comfortable! I travel a lot and from now on I'll be using Transaero as often as possible!

### Transaero Airlines customer review
DME-VCE. Service was much better than I expected it to be. Flight took off on time despite snowfall and bad weather crew were friendly 2 drink services and 1 meal service for a 3 hour flight. Meal was delicious. Airplane is clean but lacks IFE. Pillows and blankets are provided. Towels and sweets given before departure. Overall a very good experience with Transaero Airlines and definitely will recommend this airline.

### Transaero Airlines customer review
DME-LAX-DME. Fine web check-in and then final check-in at the airport take-off on time. Very old B747-400 with cables and wires visible from the cabin impossible to hear the messages from the crew. Unequal service - some stewardesses being very rude. On the flight back from LAX part of the cabin could not have lights turned off so many people could not sleep on the night flight.

### Transaero Airlines customer review
Night DME-KJA-DME 5-hour-flight. Got a Web check-in with the boarding pass sent to the mobile however still had to rush about the airport looking to print out the paper pass as there were no electronic boarding pass procedure at the airport not even a way to print it out quickly at the Check-in kiosks after the registration was closed (was registered 10 hours before the flight). Inflight service was slow and poorly organized It would make more sense on a night flight to start and finish the flight service during the first part of the flight to let people rest rather than drag it out through the whole flight. Seat comfort was close to nothing - literally no leg room (I am 180 cm-5'11) - its a shame to pay normal price for a low-cost service.

### Transaero Airlines customer review
LAX to Moscow DME return in economy class. The food was fine. The staff were friendly. The seats were fine. I slept for 7 hours with no problems on both the outbound and inbound flights. I would recommend this airline for the price you will not get a better flight.

### Transaero Airlines customer review
Tel Aviv - Moscow and Moscow - Toronto return on Boeing 767777. The food is just unacceptable - it reminds the food level and quality the airlines used to serve in the 80s. Although there is a personal screen on the back of the seat in front of every person no movies are displayed just previews to some movies which Transaero will show u a personal DVD player if you pay. A 10 hours flight and no entertainment supplied!

### Transaero Airlines customer review
Holiday flight from Moscow DME to Lisbon. Paid EUR 750 for a return ticket which is far too much for what you get. Transaero has a separate check-in zone in Domodedovo and flights to Europe have dedicated check- in counters though there is no indication of it whatsoever. I saw people flying to Astana queuing in front of me were refused check-in and had to queue again at another counter. Boarding started on time then there was a very long bus ride to the remote part of the airport. After boarding a 1-hr delay was announced as the purser explained - due to bad weather in DME. From my window I could see planes taking off and landing. Onboard the legroom was very good much larger than usual in Economy. Staff reasonably friendly food served was not tasty but filling. The selection was beef or chicken. There was no inflight entertainment. The return flight was on time with exactly the same features onboard.

### Transaero Airlines customer review
Flew JFK-DMD-ALA and back. The flying stock is old and outdated. Broken seats and trays. Smelly unsanitary lavatories. No entertainment provided during the transatlantic flights unless you paid $20 for a portable player. Attendants are full of attitude and in need of training on courteous service. I wouldn't feed livestock with the meals they serve. Basically you get what you paid for. Cheap but not worth it.

### Transaero Airlines customer review
Flew from Tashkent to Moscow then to New York. The breakfast omelette was like a piece of rubber and tasted awful. The other meals were no better. The crew on the other hand was great with one exception. The TV screen did not function at all but I slept most of the way anyway.

### Transaero Airlines customer review
My seat was dirty. For food we were given no options for 1 meal and 2 options for the second. They came by twice with drinks for the entire 10-11 hour flight. We each had a screen in front of us that didn't work. Would have been worth it if I had my luggage with me. Landed on Friday in New York and it took till Wednesday to get our luggage.

### Transaero Airlines customer review
Service was very good though I found it a tad annoying that the primary language was Russian. Planes were very comfortable with ample space for feet and an extremely comfortable seat. Staff were very courteous when I asked for several drinks within a few minutes. I found the slight lack in entertainment a bit frustrating. I would suggest bringing along an Ipod.

### Transaero Airlines customer review
Lyon-Moscow-Lyon in Economy class. 737 are a bit old and not very clean FA's gave out sweets before take off and later with hot tissues 1st beverage service and hot meal. 2nd beverage service and sweet before landing! Seats are not very comfortable but a direct flight from Lyon-Moscow in these conditions is very nice!

### Transaero Airlines customer review
Moscow to London. Economy and apart from no visual entertainment it was pretty good. I received champagne upon take off (in aid of Russian Christmas Eve). On my 4.5 hour flight I was offered non alcoholic and alcoholic refreshments another 5 times and then was brought tea and sparkling water. Staff were helpful and polite and the seats comfortable. The aircraft was aged but well maintained. I would definitely fly with no reservations flying with considering the price.

### Transaero Airlines customer review
Heathrow T1 to Domodedovo. At check-in there was a long queue and apparently a delay due to weather in Moscow. We were delayed 5 hours but they did hand out £30 vouchers for food/drink. The plane was a very outdated airbus seating was very uncomfortable as was leg space. The cabin toilets were awful the taps weren't working urine all over the floor and no water to wash hands. After talking to a robotic cabin crew member she handed me some bottles of water and told me to use them to wash my hands. The food was nice but it was little to make me impressed about this airline.

### Transaero Airlines customer review
LHR-DME. We flew an ageing 737. The plane was packed and everyone had a lot of hand luggage so there was little room for storage. Cabin crew were completely indifferent to boarding passengers and did their best to ignore them. Absolutely no assistance was offered The steward at the front of the plane used his position to glare at everyone. Departure was delayed for about an hour of course no announcements. We were offered a soft drink and that was the last liquid we saw for the next 3.5 hours. One got the impression that the cabin crew had decided that it wasn't worth the bother of attending to passengers and they all walked about with morose and sulking expressions. I would only ever consider Transaero if the price was significantly lower.

### Transaero Airlines customer review
The food was mostly awful. Out of 4 flights (Tel Aviv-Moscow-New York and back) food only edible New-York-Moscow. The crew knew little English and didn't make much of an effort to help. Newspapers were Russian only. Moscow-New York there was no audio or movie and we were offered to rent a video game for 40 USD - on the flight back there were movies but all in Russian.

### Transaero Airlines customer review
DME (Moscow) to LHR. Good check-in staff but from there things were not up to scratch. Inflight announcements indecipherable cabin crew unfriendly and food and service definitely not up to international standards. Needs significant improvement.

### Transaero Airlines customer review
Moscow to Hurghada Monastir and Antalya. All flights were on B747 old ones but well maintained. No delays smooth and efficient check-in. Business Class Lounge in Domodedovo was pretty comfortable. Seats were huge (as the aircraft's were previously with some Japanese airlines they kept what was First Class and offer it as Business). Cabin crew were courteous and efficient. Meal was excellent generous portions with a good selection but the main thing was the quality of food was of a high standard.

### Transaero Airlines customer review
LHR-DME-SVX Decided on Transaero as the price was quite good compared to other companies and an excellent safety record. Premium Economy on the outward flight and Economy on the inbound flight. Flew on aging Boeing 737's and decor was faded. We were put in the front row on both legs outbound as we were traveling with our children. However the airline doesn't supply bassinets. The onboard service to Moscow was good with helpful FA's and for the first time I can remember we were given the baby and child's meal I had ordered. The leg room in Premium Economy is excellent and I would recommend Premium Economy on this airline if you are flying with children. The problems started in Moscow. We were told that we had to pick up our baggage in Moscow but we had prepared ourselves for that. However when checking our baggage into Moscow the airline refused to take our buggy past security as they did at Heathrow and insisted it be placed into the hold as luggage. We were told it was either too heavy too complicated or some other reason. The reason was made clear as they said don't worry about having to carry your son because you can hire a buggy which can be taken past security for 200RUB. This is a blatant rip-off and a cheap attempt to make money and the Transaero representative was rude and offensive even for Russian customer services. We felt we had no choice but to hire one and we boarded the connecting flight. The service was not as good and the FA's had a bored and disinterested approach although we did get our child and baby meal again. On our return flight we were told that we didn't have to pick up our luggage at Moscow but that the buggy would have to be taken into the airplane and we would have to pay another 200RUB in Moscow. At Moscow we also discovered that for some reason the check-in assistant had put myself my son and my wife in random seats in the aircraft to London and it was only with a fellow passenger agreeing to move that we could sit together. When another passenger asked what was going on and we explained she just shrugged and said that's what you get when you fly Transaero The service was a bit erratic to London when we asked for a pillow for our sleeping son after take off was told curtly that they had run out and quite a few were impatient with other passengers.The food was quite good on all legs but no drinks runs were made. Only the London Moscow flight had any IFE which was an old Soviet cartoon played on a VHS player. However to listen to it you had to pay 200RUB for the headphones. On the Moscow London flight they were handing out portable media players to watch movies but you had to pay 500RUB to hire one. The trip had some good areas when the service is good it is good. It has the potential to be a very good airline but it needs to be more consistent with its service on the flight and stop trying to add extra charges before and during the flights and as with other Russian airlines it falls down badly on customer service. It is 2-star airline but it could be so much better.

### Transaero Airlines customer review
JFK to DME then to Kazan. Overall the flight was enjoyable. The food was much better than we received before from Aeroflot. The crew was nice and spoke mostly Russian but did try to speak english. On our way back from Kazan to Moscow DME they wanted to charge us extra for our baggage. My wife tried to explain to them that this only one leg of an international flight to New York JFK. After a while they waived the extra baggage weight fees. Overall I would rate Transaero about a 7 out of a 10. We did have a 20 hour layover in Moscow (DME) because not enough flights to America.

### Transaero Airlines customer review
It was not super luxurious but it was totally fine and definitely nicer than my last Aeroflot flight. The flight was a little late (less than 1hr) seats were a normal level of comfort food was abundant and pretty good as airline food goes. It's not like one of the established European carriers (no choice of 46 movies etc.) but all in all I felt like they had their act together and would fly with them again. Given the low price it was an exceptionally good value.

### Transaero Airlines customer review
TLV to JFK with a change of planes in Moscow (DME). Everything about this airline was frustrating. It is almost impossible to get anyone on the phone either in Israel or NY. You cannot pre-select seats. Despite what I was told they were not able to issue a boarding pass for the second flight when I checked in for the first flight. In general the attitude of the flight crew was that anyone who did not speak Russian didn't rate much attention. Despite the attractive fare I will never consider flying with them again.

### Transaero Airlines customer review
New York JFK to Moscow. Surprisingly cheap tickets and good service in economy. The crew spoke good english and were courteous. Both meal services were quite nice taking into account free wine selection. Tea/coffee and ice-cream service in the middle of the flight looked like a compensation for the non-existent IFE (program on the overhead projectors and monitors was only in Russian).

### Transaero Airlines customer review
YYZ-DME-KBP return. Online check-in for flight out worked fine some issues on return flight but quickly resolved. Food was acceptable cabin staff were terrific with good language skills in both Russian and English. Minor time delays on return flight but not fault of airline.

### Transaero Airlines customer review
I would recommend to stay away from this airline. It is impossible to get in touch with anyone in London. If you need a letter confirming the delay for insurance puposes you need to fill out a form in Russian get is signed and stamped by a solicitor pay a fee of about £12.00 through a Russian banking system and hope that within a month they will send you this letter.

### Transaero Airlines customer review
We have been stuck in Moscow for some days now. Admittedly the weather crisis is not the airlines fault but the attitude of the staff at Moscow Airport is unacceptable. Some of the staff even had a smirk on their faces as if they were celebrating our misfortune. The others just didn't want to know. After 15 hours we were banished to a dirty hotel and the next day missed the bus back to the airport due to bad communication so we couldn't board the afternoon flight.

Flew from Moscow to LHR (BMI codeshare). Quite happy with experience - decent service at very cheap price.

### Transaero Airlines customer review
Omsk to Moscow in Premium Economy. Check in unfriendly and wanted me to pay excess on 2 kg (solved by moving some books to carry on). Not given a choice of seat at check in. Food and drinks OK. Seats normal economy class and rather worn but with good extra legroom. Check in and hostesses did not speak any English. Premium Economy I would rate as normal economy 3-Star airline service. Well below the standard of other Premium Economy.

### Transaero Airlines customer review
Online check in didn't work. Airport check in machines didn't work. The check In agent ( no queue) accommodated me at the wrong cabin so at the gate my boarding pass was taken and returned with new seat number. Plane old legroom awful my seat back didn't stand upright. I managed to move to premium economy where I had whole row for myself as cabin was empty. The flight was third full. Crew were okay food was terrible. Flight was on time. The price was ok.

### Transaero Airlines customer review
URA to LHR return via DME. Check-in online fine. Personnel on baggage drop off both at URA and LHR (staffed by BMI) helpful and efficient. Planes are a bit on an older side but were okay and legroom in economy premium is good although seats were just what you expect from any regular Y-class seat - not premium at all. DME-LHR on 738 with airshow displaying the aircraft still in yellow TUI livery! b767-300ER on return from LHR - okay leg room and they were showing a film but NO headphones on offer! Food not bad but not too good either but FA's are very efficient and friendly. Overall an average carrier which however takes you from A to B safely and on time. I would recommend this carrier for good fares and will use them again.

### Transaero Airlines customer review
Almaty to Vienna via Moscow Domodedovo and return. I was looking for a cheap ticket and they offered the cheapest. I wasn't expecting much maybe that's the reason why I had a very good impression later. For a 2-star airline I think they are really fair. We are both quite tall with my wife so we asked for seats next to the emergency exit where you have big legroom. We got it for every flight. Food was enough and good staff were friendly. Easy transfer in Moscow. Airport was very expensive though. Aircraft a bit old.

### Transaero Airlines customer review
DME-KHV-DME Premium economy class. Quite old but still in good shape ex-Gulf Air Boeing 767-300. Relatively cheap perfect schedule for business trips cabin crew spoke good English and were efficient in service and dealing with disgruntled and drunk passengers. 2 regular meals and beverages (Vodka cognac wine) free of charge. IFE virtually none existent except for individual multimedia players for rent (600RUR per flight) with a selection of 15 quite new releases / music and games. On direct flight they turned on general cabin video system with OHP showing the flight info. Built-in audio entertainment system worked ok on both flights. If you want a pillow - be sure to come to a flight attendant and ask it secretly. Same with blankets - the number of blankets on board isn't sufficient and roughly only 40-50% of passengers got them. Nice budget airline for domestic flights in Russia. When choosing it do not expect Singapore Airlines like service.

### Transaero Airlines customer review
DME-LED-DME SVO-HRG-SVO DME-PUJ-DME. The airline mainly specializes in international charter flights to vacation destinations with regular flights not being their priority. Every time there were some problems. On the regular flight DME-LED-DME the company failed to issue an e- ticket though the money was charged to my card. The charter flight SVO-HRG was delayed for 6 hours. The flight PUJ-DME was delayed for 3 hours while the passengers had to sit all this time in the plane with AC being turned off. Transaero fleet is fairly old the crew members are rude. Drinks & food onboard are limited. For example I was denied a second glass of tomato juice cause of the "one glass per person" policy. In fact probably the only good thing about Transaero is their offer of cheap direct long-range flights from Moscow to destinations like Punta Cana Cancun Male Denpasar etc. But considering that most likely there will be a delay the plane will be old & dirty with no in-flight entertainment serviced by rude crew the consequence of such economy of time & money is likely to be a spoiled trip. I think it is much better to pay more & fly with a stopover than fall victim to Transaero's incompetence.
