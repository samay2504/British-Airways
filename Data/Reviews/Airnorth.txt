### “Horrible customer service”
Not Verified | Horrible customer service, waited for an hour and they just hang up on me after a 2 minute conversation without resolving my problem with a refund. Call them again (after another hour of waiting time) and they hang up on me again when they felt too lazy to follow the conversation. I hope the worst future for this company and these people.

### "A lack of customer care"
Not Verified |  Part way through the flight from Cairns I noticed that the seat belt had not been properly cleaned and a clump of chewing gum had been left on it by a previous passenger. Unfortunately the gum had by now stuck to my shorts. I reported this to the cabin crew but they said they could do nothing other than give me a small wet wipe sachet to try to clean my shorts and the remainder of the gum from the seat belt. There were spare seats available but none were offered as such I had no choice but to clean the belt or not use it. Not much choice there. I sent an email to Airnorth advising of my experience but have never received a response. A lack of customer care would seem to be endemic throughout the organization. Never again. Even if I have to pay more with another airline.

### "Horrible customer service"
Not Verified |  Horrible customer service, double charged and have now been unreachable and not returning any e-mails or calls for months. Pure garbage. The only way they are still operational is they have a monopoly on remote access.

### "These guys are terrible"
Not Verified |  Absolutely dreadful. These guys are terrible, they have zero care for customers. Flights cancelled without detail and no communication. This is a normal practice for them. Can't express my disgust with these guys, they have no consideration at all,

### "cannot provide a consistently reliable service"
The only thing consistent about Airnorth is their inconsistency! I live in a town where it’s our only choice of airline so we have to continually endure rescheduled flights (I’m not talking about minutes behind, I mean hours and hours) You are forever missing connecting flights, losing money on motel rooms, rentals etc. Their pricing is typical of an airline who has a monopoly on a service, and I can live with that, but it’s the simple fact that they cannot provide a consistently reliable service for the money they get that infuriates me. And only providing a tiny bottle of water and a packet of cheese and crackers as in flight catering is poor. If you have the choice, never fly with this airline of inutility.

### "Had the worst experience with Air North"
Not Verified |  Had the worst experience with Air North whilst trying to get to Perth during the pandemic. Booked a flight with them from Darwin to Perth and never received any details of the flight confirmation in my inbox. Tried to call customer service and email several times and said the line had been disconnected. My card has been charged and I've now been trying to get the money back for this flight for about 3 months now. Still unresolved, still haven't managed to speak to a single person in customer service at Air North. Now being resolved with my bank.

### "I am so impressed with Air North"
I am so impressed with Air North. The last time I flew with a different airline, I remember waiting ages for drink service that only came around once and paying something ridiculous for a small snack. But Air North blew that experience out of the water! Complimentary food and drinks are one thing, but this was only a 2.5 hour flight and they kept us busy the whole time serving drinks, a lovely sandwich, a cookie, and then more drinks. I was positively full at the end of the flight. And when I complimented the cookies (oatmeal chocolate chip served warm!) the very lovely stewardess, Keely, got me and my sister (my travelling companion) a few for the road!! She gave us good tips for visiting the Yukon, too. The airline was clean, flight was smooth and service was fantastic. I wish Air North flew everywhere - they would be my first choice every time.

### "Disgusting service"
Flight changed twice from 5 and half hours to 8 hours and re routed from stop over in Townsville to Cairns with nearly three hour wait, then a trip into Gove before touching down in Darwin at 11.30 pm. I paid a descent fare to travel with a young child at reasonable time of day. This was a hell of a trip. Worst part is I couldn't ring to find out what was going on as no one would answer the phone. Disgusting service. I will no longer support the local airline once they have your money they don't give a toss.

### "unreliable and unprofessional service"
Totally unreliable and unprofessional service from Airnorth. Initial booking was rescheduled three times. Meaning I had to change hire car booking and appointments twice, the third charge I had to cancel as there was no time to organise accommodation. Rescheduled flight for the 9th of September. Plane has been delayed with no expected eta, no updates to passengers. As to why this has occurred. For a return flight time of two hours it has cost $1200, for this price we should get a decent meal on the plane. But $1200 we will a small packet of chips and a bottle of water. If only we had competition in the Northern Territory.

### "Thank you for the great service"
Sydney to Kununurra . Thank you for the great service rendered by the flight crew for the flight that left Kununurra at 6pm to Darwin on the 23rd December,. All credit goes to them as it was the best smooth landing I have ever experienced.

### "surprised by the high quality"
Darwin to Dili. An excellent flight - really surprised by the high quality. Early morning departure from Darwin led to a pretty generous breakfast - frittata, yoghurt, coffee and juice. Pretty amazing for an hour-long flight (and significantly more generous than what we received on our flight up from Melbourne on a full priced carrier). Staff were friendly, energetic and professional. Love the crocodile skin belts. A nice touch of the Northern Territory. The return leg from Dili left half an hour early. Ran out of food options early, but on an hour-long flight, you can cope.

### "excellent value for money"
Darwin to Dili. The Embraer 170 seats 76 passengers, all in economy. Airnorth (the Australian, not the Canadian company!) runs regional services across northern Australia, including one international flight to Dili, the capital of Timor Leste (East Timor). It is the shortest international route flown out of Australia at 1 hr 20 minutes! Apart from magazines there is no IFE, but refreshments are served. Outwards from Darwin to Dili in the late afternoon it was a chicken wrap and soft drink; coming back at 8 am it was a light breakfast with tea or coffee. Leg room is fine (I am 178 cm tall) and the seats are comfortable for a short flight. Ground crew in Darwin and the cabin crew were cheerful and efficient. The check-in counter staff in Dili were efficient but not particularly cheerful - a minor point. This flight was booked on a special sale fare and was excellent value for money - normally the flights are a bit expensive.

### "avoid when flying to and from Dili"
Dili to Darwin. Please avoid Airnorth if possible when flying to and from Dili, Timor Leste. You would be better served to fly via Nam Air or Citilink via Bali. AirNorth was 3 hrs late today resulting in my young children missing their connecting flight in Darwin to Brisbane costing me $700 to purchase alternate connecting flight to Brisbane via JetStar. I called AirNorth Customer Service to only be chastised by the most rude Customer Service Representative in the world. She essentially said it was my fault for not anticipating the fact that AirNorth has a historically poor "on-time" schedule and it was my problem if I missed a connecting flight even though I had 3 hrs between flights (AirNorth was 3 hrs late so I missed the once daily Virgin Australia Flight from Darwin to Brisbane).

### "unbelievably high fares"
Connecting Airnorth flight to PER via BME. Outbound flight delayed nearly 90 minutes as late departing from Darwin (the origin of this two stop flight). Connecting flight at Broome was held for transferring pax, bags made it through and were first off carousel at Perth. Very impressive that the flights were held, great service in this day and age. Onward flights to Perth with QF uneventful. Downside is that this regional airline charges unbelievably high fares on these routes - often in excess of an international long haul Y fare to Europe of North America, and far, far more than a comparable domestic ticket - there is no justification for the cost, except a virtual monopoly on these routes.

### "was pleasantly surprised"
Airnorth (Australian Airnorth that is) code-sharing with QantasLink has recently commenced a mostly daily non-stop service from the almost new Toowoomba-Wellcamp Airport to Melbourne (and also does a Toowoomba-Cairns run as well). I thought I'd give it a try for a business trip and was pleasantly surprised. Check-in is nicely efficient through the QantasLink staff, seating and also inflight service is pleasant except for the very annoying practice of loudly announcing the facilities etc on-board immediately after the aircraft has lifted off making for a very nerve racking experience - and I am a very frequent flyer who is never nervous. Forget the charm and excitement of the take-off experience. Why do some airlines do this these days? I had the same awful experience on a recent British Airways flight from Dubai to London. What a crazy idea. Also it is worth noting that Airnorth use Terminal 4 at Melbourne so don't make the mistake of thinking you can make a quick connection to regular Qantas or Qantaslink flights in Melbourne as these are in another terminal and quite a long walk awaits you from the Airnorth aircraft arrival gate across to the Qantas Terminal. The Qantas web-site and booking system does not seem to get that (yet). Apart from these 'teething troubles' I would cautiously recommend Airnorth.

### "experience was exceptional"
My experience on Airnorth was exceptional, with their super comfortable seats coupled with amazing service. The cabin crew were constantly doing rounds making sure we had everything we needed and serving us drinks, meals and even warm cookies! Our flight was not at all delayed, and our baggage was out for us in no time at all! I would definitely recommend this airline for anyone traveling in western Canada or Ottawa!

### "good value for money"
The Airnorth flight did not get off to a good start - having been delayed by an hour. Once in the air, service was efficient and effective. The in flight food was satisfactory. The seats are adequate, with sufficient pitch and recline to not cause any issues. The tickets were bought on special, giving good value for money.

### Airnorth customer review
Had another wonderful flight from Whitehorse to Vancouver. Disappointed that's had to transit via Kelowna however. Makes a relatively short flight into a long one. I was also very disappointed in the agent boarding the aircraft. Very rude and poorly trained. First denied me boarding for invalid ID that's had used to board the Air North flight from Vancouver to Whitehorse. Another agent had to inform her my ID was valid and acceptable for travel. The flight attendants however were very attentive and defiantly made up for it all.

### Airnorth customer review
Flew YVR-YXY-YVR. Flights both left on time and were pleasant and smooth. Flight Attendants were very friendly and helpful throughout the flight.

### Airnorth customer review
I have to put in some severe criticism of Airnorth's customer service during the ash cloud disruption in June. My original morning flight on Sat 31 May Dili-Darwin was cancelled - fair enough. Airport staff thought it might operate in the afternoon and sent us home. The call centre told about midday that they hadn't decided what to do yet but would contact everyone later. About 3pm I got a call from the Qantas call centre to reschedule connecting flights and they saw in the system that Airnorth had rebooked me for 5pm Sunday. Then on Sunday morning I looked at Airnorth's website and it said that my 5pm flight had been changed to 12.45pm so I rushed off to the airport. It turned that was wrong and we were sent home. The call centre isn't open on Sundays so I had no idea what was happening. Eventually I saw on Darwin airport's website that the incoming fight had been cancelled (all other airlines operated normally from Dili and Darwin that afternoon). Airnorth eventually called at 7pm to tell me I was rescheduled for 5pm Monday. Normally Airnorth flights have been fine - on time good staff limited food but only short flights anyway. However they really can't handle anything unusual and given their monopoly on many routes they probably won't bother to improve.

### Airnorth customer review
Darwin to Kununurra in an E-170. Comfortable 2-abreast seating and a smooth flight. However there was a confusing beginning in Darwin as the departures screen said "go to gate" but did not give a gate number! Eventually a barely audible "last call" announcement was made. The service on-board was friendly. A pack of two small muffins and orange juice was served. The flight operated on time.

### Airnorth customer review
DWN-TSV then GCA-DWN - April 2014. Flight down was direct on time and with good inflight service. Return flight via MT ISA less pleasing mainly because the FA's jammed us all together despite a number of rows of empty seats at the front of the plane. I hate having to ask to move once seated and with carry on in the o/head lockers. There was no need (that I can see) to stack us that way and it just left a bad taste in the mouth. Food on the return flights was similarly 'bad' in the mouth. 1st leg was a beef curry (very boarding school type muck) and 2nd leg described as a chicken wrap which turned out to be a beef wrap. Too bad if you were allergic and took a bite (surprise! ).

### Airnorth customer review
TSV-DRW-TSV: We chose to fly with Air North because of good connection flight times when returning from our overseas holiday. We arrived in Darwin at 4.50am after being in transit for 12 hrs from an overseas destination we were scheduled to fly back to Townsville on the 7.00am flight which was perfect. Air North changed the flight schedule our new departure time was 1.45pm. An increased wait of 6.45 hours at Darwin airport. I contacted Air North and inquired if any assistance could be given to us meal voucher half day accommodation etc. I received an email from the Marketing and Communications Manager who sighted their rules of carriage and provided us with details of a local motel for us to contact no assistance was offered not even a coffee voucher! We were very disappointed in Air Norths lack of customer care and would not recommend using Air North especially when connecting to/from International flights.

### Airnorth customer review
TSV-DRW-TSV flight out on time the aircraft was clean and comfortable certainly more personal space on the Embraer 170 then you get on other economy flights in Australia. The cabin wasn't full so after take off it was a matter of grabbing a pair of seats to myself. A light morning meal of sandwiches water coffee/tea and a small chocolate was complimentary. The return flight was delayed 7 hours and advice was received about this the afternoon before by email and SMS. Two hot meal options offered on that flight one vegetarian the other sausages and mash. Beer wine and spirits were complimentary on this leg perhaps owing to the long delay I didn't ask I just enjoyed having two seats to myself again and kicked back with a fee Jim Beam and cola's. Flight attendants professional and attentive.

### Airnorth customer review
Broome to Kununurra then Kununurra to Perth on ERJ 170. All flights on time fairly basic food but professional cabin service with 2 FA's keen to please. Seat rows are 2x2 and the seat pitch seems to be greater than economy in the newer 737's operated by Qantas mainline. A neat little aircraft. Love their direct service now three times between Perth and Kununurra - the only airline providing this service and also appreciate their 'milk runs' which allow easy connections several times a week between Karratha Port Hedland Broome Kununurra and Darwin. A dependable airline serving the remote bits of WA and other carriers could learn a lesson or two.

### Airnorth customer review
Return DRW-DIL. Efficient boarding on-time helpful cabin attendants. Flight out provided minimal catering though this was a late afternoon flight. Return flight was early morning good breakfast akin to what I would normally have at home. In-flight magazine had really interesting articles and was adequate reading for the one hour flight. No complaints at all. No charge for exceeding baggage allowance by 1kg on return flight.

### Airnorth customer review
Kununurra-Broome in an ERJ-170. A very pleasant flight. The seat pitch and light refreshments were fine for such a short leg. The seats have comfortable adjustable headrests. The service was friendly and the flight departed and arrived 20 minutes early.

### Airnorth customer review
DPS-DRW on Embraer E170. This is a great little airline and a great little plane. Comfy seats with plenty of legroom free alcoholic drinks and a hot snack. They even served double drinks which is something I hadn't encountered in economy in a long time. Meal was a choice of hot meat or chicken pie plus cheese and crackers and a Twix. Service very friendly. Being such a small plane getting through immigration in Darwin was a breeze and the luggage was already on the belt when I got there. Customs was also easy. Unfortunately Airnorth are ceasing operations this route at the end of January 2009.
