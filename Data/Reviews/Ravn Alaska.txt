### "Would not recommend"
Not Verified |  Kenai to Anchorage. Plane was delayed with no reason given, then after boarding we had to wait for the paperwork for around 10 minutes. This caused us to miss our window and get delayed 40 more minutes in an extremely hot plane, causing us and many others to miss connecting flights. Would not recommend.

### "delayed and I missed connection"
Not Verified |  Do not use this airline if you have any other options. I travel instate extensively for business. Over the last month, 2 flights into Kotzebue got cancelled. Last week, my flight from Homer got delayed and I missed my connection in Anchorage back to Fairbanks. Alaska Airlines, although a partner, said it was my problem that I missed my connection. Have a heated discussion, was finally given a seat, with a 5 hours wait in Anchorage. Yesterday, (May 14) I flew to Dillingham. Again, the flight out of Anchorage was delayed, and for some reason my one small suitcase was not onboard. I was told it would arrive on the 5:00pm flight and did not. This morning I was told it would be on the 9:30 flight, and it was not. The desk agent in Dillingham tried to call the Anchorage desk, and no one will answer the phone. A family member called the corporate office an hour ago, she was told the desk was too busy and we have not heard back.

### "give away your seat"
Anchorage to Kenai. They will give away your seat even if you are in the airport. Not worth the risk to fly with them. I give them the lowest rating possible. Who gives away a paid for seat? These guys. Shouldn't I be able to use or not use my seat as I see fit?

### "overall experience was fantastic"
I flew on Ravn Alaska with my girlfriend back in February. We flew from Anchorage to Homer (and back) with ease. The flight was brief and enjoyable. The staff were friendly and welcoming. Check-in: a breeze. Boarding: a breeze. Baggage pick-up: a breeze. The overall experience was fantastic. Looking forward to flying with Ravn again and taking in those unforgettable Alaska sights.

### "issues with last minute delays"
‚ùå Not Verified |  Anchorage to Homer. I have had several issues with last minute delays in the past with no information on why and then today I go to check in and they've changed my flight to an earlier time with the justification that "they attempted to contact me". I've flown with Ravn forever but if I had any other airline options for my flight home I would take it in an instant.

### "delayed with no explanation
Anchorage to Homer. Last 4 times I have flown with Ravn Alaska my flights been delayed with no explanation given at any point. Starting to think maybe Ravn Alaska just doesn't know how fast their planes go? Other than that i have no issues but waiting an extra hour or more every time i fly is getting old.

### "never be using Ravn again"
Ravn Alaska is so frustrating. First off, your carry-on items will all pretty much have to be checked, unless they're tiny. So my husband and I 'short-checked' our carry-on bags to our next airline, since the next airline we transferred to would have enough room to stow them overhead. Then, we took this tiny 19-seater plane, which (once boarding was finished) started up the engines only to have them shut off three times, before the stewardess announced "something is wrong, the pilots are going to try fix it" (that's comforting) and gave out cookies to passengers to shift focus. Finally we were told by the pilots that there was a technical issue that could be 'deferred for now', and once they get paperwork done then we can take off. At one point early on, we were told it would be about 15 more minutes, then about half an hour later they said it'll be about 10 more minutes until takeoff. Overall we were delayed IN the plane sitting there pre-runway for an hour. And our next layover was 1 hr 20 min, so when we arrived at the next airport, we had literally 10 minutes until the next plane terminal would close the gate, to deplane, get our bags from baggage claim, go through security, and run to our next gate. Upon deplaning, we asked the ground crew if we could just grab our short-checked bags right there on the Tarmac, they said no. We were told the baggage claim was close by - which it wasn't. My husband and I ran (not a good idea when you're 7 months pregnant and not a runner by nature), he ran to baggage claim to get our bags while I ran to our next gate to try keep the door open until my husband arrived with our bags. As soon as I arrived, I was told to get onboard right now, and when I begged them to wait just a couple minutes for my husband who was running up as we spoke, they said they could not and closed the door right in front of me. Thanks a lot Ravn, for making us short-check our appropriately sized carry-on's,  having technically unsound planes, being untruthful about how much more time we'd be delayed on the Tarmac,  not letting us grab our short-checked bags after de-planing, and not apparently notifying the next gate that multiple passengers (including us) were delayed and on their way running to he gate. It ruined our night and our trip home, and we felt so ripped off by this airline. We will certainly never be using Ravn again and have let our friends know to avoid this airline as well.

### "was never on time"
I have flown out of Homer 4 times this year to Anchorage and Ravn Alaska was never on time. One time it was so late we missed our connectung flight. This is our only choice in Homer. If you take that flight make your connecting flights a few hours out and expect a delay. Then you won't be dissapointed.

### Ravn Alaska customer review
ANC-FAI-ANC Economy Open Seating. Check in was difficult. The checkin agent did not understand how to read my ticket and almost seemed to blame me for the error. Once on board however the flight attendants both on the outbound and return were very nice especially on the return flight a definite sense of humor. Era offers low fares between Anchorage and Fairbanks and I will be flying with them again. It's also nice not to have to go to security when flying on the smaller planes.
