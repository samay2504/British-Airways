### "simply not worth it"
Just don't travel with this company. It's simply not worth it. It's not a trustful company. It was my first try with it, but they have already disappointed me. They cancelled my return flight Paris to Sao Paulo with a message saying only: "your flight is cancelled. If you need to contact us, go to our webpage or call us on xxxx number (0,06 euros per minute)". I tried to call immediately, and I didn't get any answer. I tried many times. Then I requested a refund through the online form and I'm waiting to see how much time they will take and how much they will actually refund once their policy says they do not refund services fees, which they put up the double price of the actual flight. My guess is that they do that very often to oblige costumers to fly with them when they want, or when they have enough passengers. They cancel your dates and then you will have to rebook your flight to another date which they will impose to you and which may be the one there are enough passengers. I won't do that though. I will get my refund, whatever they refund and never deal with them anymore.

### "Do not recommend at all"
Kiev to Paris. So, I bought tickets 1.5 months before the trip. Unfortunately, plans had changed, I had to cancel my trip. I also purchased insurance for cancellation with tickets. So a week before the flight, I wanted to cancel my tickets. I tried to call for 3 days in a row to their support line and every time I was listening to music for 10-15 minutes and getting billed for that (calling from abroad is quite expensive), but no one ever picked up the phone (during their official business hours). I sent multiple emails about my request - no reply. I tried to submit multiple requests via manage my booking on their website - but every time I tried to submit I got the ticket number with status closed right away and no ability to check it. So, in the end, I just lost my money and their insurance is worthless as nobody will ever get back to you. Do not recommend at all. First time seeing such big company who does not care about their customers at all. And their website has a lot of bugs as well. Find another company to flight with.

### "changing 3 letters cost 80EUR"
I visit my parents regularly in Paris, I always use Air France, Transavia, or Middle east airlines. But today was the first and last flight with this Aigle Azur. On the passport my name is Ludovic while on the ticket its Ludwig. The family name is the same. So because of 3 letters difference, they want to charge 80 euros. Why changing 3 letters cost 80EUR? This is how you lose passengers.

### "Worst airline I experienced"
It was my first time flying with Aigle Azur. To be honest, I didn't choose it, but Hainan Airlines. To start with, we took off with more then 2 hours delay without notifications. It wasn't the airport issue, but the company problem, because we had to wait for the plane to arrived from Sao Polo. I will skip the on-board service. So we arrived with 2 hours delayed, and, with other customers, we have a connection flight to Shanghai. This second flight is Hainan Airlines. Obviously the flight didn't wait for us. No one to received us after landing to give instructions or anything. When we asked to change the connection flight ticket at Hainan counter, we are told "Aigle Azur didn't confirmed the delay in your flight, so we can't change your flight ticket". The company is late and didn't even assume its responsibility. As a result, we had to pay for an other flight ticket, Aigle Azur customer service doesn't even exist / isn't reachable. Worst airline I experienced, I should have considered to read the reviews about this airline first.

### "they could smile a bit more"
Berlin to Paris. Flight on time, clean and modern plane. It was impossible to buy any drinks due to an issue with their visa machine. The crew was ok but they could smile a bit more. At Orly airport, we had to disembark by bus, which took 10 minutes to finally be at the south terminal.

### "Worst experience ever!"
Beirut to Paris. Worst experience ever! I booked online a two way ticket for a very tight scheduled business flight and after taking the money from my bank account a few days later i received a notification that the return flight was rescheduled to two days later which does not suite me although tickets offerings for the same date were still available on many sites online. A couple of days later the original return flight was totally cancelled. I was later offered in return another ticket two days earlier or full refund. Upon choosing the full refund I got back less than 40% of my paid amount for this trip and the argument was that they only full refund the return ticket that was changed and the outbound ticked is non refundable. The funniest thing is that the cancelled flight was charged much less than the outbound flight and this was the only amount subject to full refund. I never recommend Aigle Azur. I rate this act as a sort of phishing. They lie to you about cheap available flights and then reschedule it based on their interest so you will be the only and major loser for cancelling if the rescheduling does not suite you.

### "Definitely the last time"
Berlin to Paris Orly. Bought the ticket online a week ago and it was impossible to add a luggage. I connected on the official Website add my luggage for 25 eur, received a mail saying it was charged. Checked the morning of my flight and no luggage added, no money debited. Tried all morning to add a luggage on the bugged website. Declined, declined they it seemed to work since it displayed the total amount of the flight and the luggage of 25eur. To discover at check in that that did not work and that they would charge me the double. Not good. Second time with Aigle Azur and always an issue. Definitely the last time.

### "no customer service to contact"
Basel Mulhouse to Algiers on 19/03/206. It was scheduled for 14:50 and departed at 20:06, without any explanation, excuse or apology. The only representative the company had at the airport could not give any information, nor provide any help to the hundreds of passengers stuck at the airport. What is even worse is that the company has no customer service to contact, no telephone number and no email address. The only way to contact the company is through a form on their website to which you will never get any answer ever!

### Aigle Azur customer review
Paris Orly to Lisbon new airline for me seat and leg room average but if your traveling with baggage the 20kg baggage allowances included in the fare makes Aigle Azur worth considering. Cabin crew did a quick run through the cabin with a (paid) drinks cart then duty free cart and promptly disappeared behind the curtain for the rest of the flight. The airline appears to be unsure of its identity although they provide a baggage allowance they are not a full service airline as this flight was over a meal time (dinner) no food or snack service provided but not a LOCO as no food was available for purchase either so we went hungry!

### Aigle Azur customer review
Porto to Paris Orly on ZI 312 (A320) on 28 March 2014. First time on this airline and I'm a little bit unimpressed with check-in at Porto Airport. No effort to direct passengers to correct boarding desks hence I ended up in the web-check in/bag-drop queue with passengers who had not even checked in online. Thankfully queue was processed within 20 minutes and got to the gate with plenty of time to spare. My seat was next to the emergency exit so I had plenty of legroom. Seat itself was comfy and perfect for a nap. Crew extremely professional and always had a smile on their faces. Flight took off on time and landed smoothly in Paris-Orly 20 minutes ahead of scheduled arrival time. Once on the ground we were told by the cabin crew that the captain of this Aigle Azur flight had piloted his last flight so we promptly congratulated him as we departed the aircraft. All in all Aigle Azur was worth the money that I paid . Not sure if I'll have another chance to travel on them again but if they have routes that I want to fly I'll keep them in mind.

### Aigle Azur customer review
BSL-ALG-BSL on A320 both legs. First time flown ZI and overall was an impressive experience. The cabin was quite clean and the seat was quite comfortable with good pitch. Warm and delicious meal for 2 hrs flight was a very good service. Another positive was the 30 kg free baggage for all economy class passenger.

### Aigle Azur customer review
Lyon to Oran. Two Airbus A320 are mainly dedicated for operations between Lyon ad Algeria. I would allow that the service tends to decrease. I can't stand how Aigle Azur operates "charter planes with high density configuration for regular flights between France and Algeria. It is unbearable to get sat so tight in those seating rows impossible to move or eat correctly.

### Aigle Azur customer review
I did some flights with Aigle Azur on Paris - Hassi Messaoud route (Algeria for those who are not familiar). This flight has only one type of customer: oil & gas people. I have found the service as fair overall crew friendliness and meals are actually in good category (crew friendlier then Air France). It's a pity Aigle Azur does not have baggage transfer handling agreement at CDG which means that each time we transit at CDG to / from other airlines we need to go through the immigration to recover our luggage no automatic transfer between Aigle Azur and other airlines at CDG (leading to LOSS of luggage at CDG for those not in the know such as in my case). I hope they could one day operate inside Algeria (the company owner is Algerian - French) since with the local monopoly by Air Algerie the service is non existent.

### Aigle Azur customer review
Have flown Paris Orly to Oran return several times over the last three months. Whilst there have been some delays this has not always been due to the airline. Air crew seem extremely helpful carrying children and baggage to seats etc. Overall service much better that I would have expected and a generous luggage allowance.
