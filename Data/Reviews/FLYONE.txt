### "they didn’t compensate the damage"
They ask to register online 4+ hours prior to departure to avoid airport registration fees (i think, around 40usd). I tried registering online more than four hours in advance, however, their website would not let me do it. At the airport registration, they would not issue me a boarding pass unless I paid the 40 usd. I paid the fee, got a seat in the end of the plane and have got a broken suitcase and they didn’t compensate the damage.

### "Worst experience"
Worst experience and flight company. Never again Flight from Bucharest to Antalya I do not recommend, does not respect health and safety standards. Luggage destroyed, they offered a 10 euro voucher, I never accepted. No respect for clients

### "the worst experience"
I had the misfortune of flying with Flyone on December 22 from Tel Aviv to Chisinau, and it was the worst experience I’ve ever had with an airline. The flight was scheduled for 22:40 but was delayed after check-in. We boarded the plane at 1:00 AM, only to sit for almost an hour without air conditioning, water, or proper ventilation. It was suffocating. At 2:00 AM, we were informed that the flight would now depart until 5:30 AM and were told to leave our luggage on the plane and return to the airport. As we started to leave, they changed their minds and told us to go back and collect our bags. This back-and-forth was chaotic and completely unprofessional. We finally departed at 5:15 AM, but not before enduring hours of confusion, discomfort, and complete disorganization. The crew was aggressive, unhelpful, and clearly unprepared to handle the situation. This was, without a doubt, my last time flying with Flyone. If you value your time, money, and sanity, I strongly recommend choosing another airline.

### "highly unacceptable service"
I booked the below flight on Sep 16 and didn't receive any other email communication from FlyOne. I just had confirmation with FlyOne helpdesk that my email wasn't sent a schedule change. The told me to email helpdesk to escalate the situation as claims aren't being helpful. TBS-EVN Sep 24 20:25, wegot to the airport at 18:00, 2hours and 25minutes before scheduled departure only to find our flight wasn't on the board. I then checked the FlyOne app and it showed the flight at departing at 16:45? I didn't receive any notification via email or app push notification that the flight time changed. I contacted FlyOne customer service and spoke with an agent who mentioned that an email communication was sent out to all passengers on Sep 20, I haven't received anything, I checked my junk and deleted folders. Nothing. (Today, Sep 25, FlyOne helpdesk confirmed my email wasn't sent a notification) This highly unacceptable service, and it's made me think twice about ever flying with FlyOne in the future.

### "pay for a hand luggage 130 euro"
Not Verified |  Really bad service. I was requested to pay for a hand luggage 130 euro, which is above any reasonable price. That was the first and definitely the last time I bought a ticket from that company.

### "€40 charged for check-in at airport"
Not Verified | €40 charged for check-in at airport? I’m sorry but who charges this much for a check in? On what grounds? On top of it to know about it you have to go to the website and specifically read about the checking procedure, they of course do not write it in your email confirmations with your booking! Crazy, used to be worse company to fly one - a year later and it’s still the worst company. They do everything they can to just charge you extra for every little thing, ridiculous.

### "I do not recommend this airline"
Not Verified |   I do not recommend this airline to any traveler, we flew from Cluj-Napoca to Antalya and back and each time we had a 3 hour delay. The condition of the aircraft was extremely poor, the staff extremely rude. I will never fly with them again, for sure.

### "Did not actually get to fly"
Not Verified |   Did not actually get to fly. One week before the flight they sent an email saying they had “adjusted” my flight schedule—by an entire day. We had another flight to catch, so this was not doable. Had a rather stupid conversation with someone at their office in Chisinau, trying to understand what happened. What I did understand was that I had to request a refund online. The site would not work so, I then hunt down a different email address to send the refund request which I found on a site with many complaints about FLYONE. I did get my refund, but the whole time-consuming mess cost me over $300 because I had to buy our tickets from another airline so late. Known as “FLYONCE” among my friends. I will never purchase from this airline again.

### "had a very rude reply"
To avoid extra cost for the seat reservation my elderly parents (both over 70 and my mum is disabled) completed the online check-in registration 24h prior departure. They were allocated seats far apart 16 and 30). Once they boarded, they noticed that the plane was approximately only 30% full because there was only one passenger per three seats. When my mum asked to sit next to my father as the seats next to him were free, she had a very rude reply from the flight attendant hinting something about them being mean and not spending extra money for seats reservation.

### "Don’t recommend"
Don’t recommend, is low cost but still money I bought a ticket tur retur Chișinău - Dubai via Turkey. Hand luggage was included but apparently only backpack, I had only one small luggage around 5 kg. Turkey to Chișinău flyone didn’t charge me, but when I flew From Chișinău to turkey they charge me 40 euro, and I had the same one small hand luggage. During the flight even water is not included, this flight also is not cheap, at least should include water.

### “Horrible experience”
Not Verified | I had a flight from Dubai to Chisinau scheduled at 18:45, that actually departed at 22:36, all this time we were staying by the gate, after one hour of delay the flight information was removed from the airport screens and systems, all passengers were staying by the gate without any info about why our flight was delayed, after another one hour of waiting we were notified that the captain felt sick and they are deciding what to do with our flight. Our bags were already loaded and finally at 21:25 we embarked the aircraft. The airline didn't notify us about the reason of the delay, we all lost our connecting transportations after landing. The crew members didn't have enough food for the passengers for which you have to pay of course, no complimentary water for 3 hours delay and 5 hours flying time. Horrible experience.

### “Rudest check in clerk”
Rudest check in clerk - ever. I paid 25 euros for the check-in bag as I thought I would have a big suitcase. But as it turned out, I needed only a small bag, and asked the check-in staff member if I could just carry it on instead of checking it. I have done this many times on airlines like Wizz and EasyJet. The woman sternly said no. I explained that this is quite common and not a burden on the airlines. She "boasted" that she has been doing this job for two WHOLE years and is certain that I can't change how the small suitcase is transported. What a witch. I highly recommend using a different carrier if you have to visit Yerevan.

### "professional and amiable"
Flight attendant asked if I would like to help on emergency seat, so got extra space on this very short flight. Very professional and amiable cabin staff, also on boarding. They should expand into more Western European routes, their product is good.

### "Check-in at the counter is 50 euros"
Not Verified |  Check-in at the counter is 50 euros. I tried online check-in several times and it didn't work. They seem to do this on purpose. Annoying flight crew, no water during a 4 hour flight. My flight was for 22:00 on the 24th. They rescheduled it to 01:30 on the 25th. We arrived in Moscow and the plane stood for 45 minutes with engines on because they could not connect the walkway.

### "Absolutely appalling service"
Not Verified |  Absolutely appalling service from start to finish. Booked online and told to check in online which was not possible for anyone with a foreign passport. Got to airport to check in and explained this showing them screenshots of their website saying it was unable to check us in online. They directed us to their tickets office where we had to pay 60 euros because of their error. To add insult to injury they laughed at us and everyone else who was unable to check in and had to pay this. The flight was then delayed for 8 hours and no explanation was given. We asked for some water, which was refused and food but got nothing except rudeness. When we went to their Yerevan office to complain they told us to email them. They have ignored our many emails since. This company should not be in business.

### "the worst service"
This airline is terrible! They charge you for everything and give you nothing! The worst attitude, the worst service. Don't use this airline. And if you have to, put a lot of money for extra charges!

### "worst flight company I know"
It's the worst flight company I know. I was informed at the airport, an hour before the flight, that I could not fly because the configuration of the plane was changed. Several passengers were left without seats despite the fact that they had tickets with seat numbers Why FLYONE is still allowed to operate? They are doing illegal dirty marketing. The human factor does not matter to them.

### "no notification of the cancellation"
I have traveled to 74 countries on 6 continents and this is the worst airline that I have ever flown with. On their website it says free check-in online 24 hours before the flight to 4 hours before the flight and 20kg bag charge of 31 euro when paid in advance. The website would err every time I tried to check-in in online and would not accept any of my credit cards for payment of the bag in advance. I went to the airport and they charged me 30 euros extra to check me in there even though their website was down and 50 euros for the checked bag, 80 euros in total. The agents at Dublin apologized. They didn’t work for the airline. They just did the check in stuff as Fly One doesn’t have agents in Dublin. They themselves, two different agents at Dublin airport informed me that this was a common a recurring issue with this airline. The one agent blatantly referred to it as a “scam” and the other referred to the airline as “dodgy.” These were the Dublin airport agents doing the check-in for Flight One themselves. That is how bad this airline is. Don’t use this airline. Half the flights are canceled and the extra fees will far out weigh any cost savings you think you see when you are shopping for tickets. Then on my second flight out of Moldova the following happened: FlyOne changed my flight departure time twice. Then when I arrived at the airport four hours before it was supposed to depart I found out that the flight was completely cancelled. I received no prior notification of the cancellation. The customer service agent was extremely rude. I was switched to another flight the next day at 0500 in the morning. They never apologized and never refunded me any money for the inconvenience. They make Spirit or Ryanair look like 5 star carriers.

### "cancelled it without any explanation"
I really don't understand why this airline is still allowed to fly. They first changed our flight, then they cancelled it without any explanation, no substitute transportation was offered. No communication.

### "experience was extremely disappointing"
My experience with this company was extremely disappointing. They changed my flight, causing me to miss my connecting flight and incurring a loss of $200. Their customer service was unresponsive, both on the phone and through email. This isn't the first time I've had issues with them. I strongly advise against booking with them

### "changed to ridiculous times last minute"
Not Verified |  Both of my flights were changed to ridiculous times last minute, so that I did not have any other options to choose from, and had to travel through the night.

### "Very poor management and services"
As usual, flight time got changed in the last minute. I have booked many times and it is always delayed and costs a lot. Very poor management and services.

### "a nightmarish experience"
Not Verified |  Save yourself the frustration and headaches by steering clear of this dreadful airline. I made the mistake of purchasing a ticket from them, and it turned out to be a nightmarish experience that I'll never forget. From the moment I reached out to their customer service, it was evident that they lacked basic professionalism. The representatives were unhelpful and downright rude, leaving me feeling like an inconvenience rather than a valued customer. On the day of my flight, chaos awaited me at the airport. The check-in process was a mess, with long lines and confused staff who seemed clueless about what they were doing. It was a disheartening start to what would become an arduous journey. The condition of the aircraft was equally appalling. The seats were uncomfortable and worn-out, the cabin was far from clean, and the overall atmosphere was just plain unpleasant. It was clear that they had little regard for maintaining their planes. To make matters worse, the in-flight entertainment was practically non-existent, and the limited options available were outdated and malfunctioning. The lack of effort in providing a basic amenity like this was simply disappointing. As if the discomfort and inconvenience weren't enough, the food they served was a complete letdown. The tasteless and meager portions left me hungry and dissatisfied, making the already unbearable flight even worse. Upon arrival, my fears were realized when I discovered that my luggage had been mishandled and damaged. Dealing with their customer service to resolve the issue was a nightmare in itself, as they displayed an astonishing lack of accountability and responsibility. In conclusion, my encounter with this airline was nothing short of a disaster. The unprofessional customer service, subpar amenities, discomfort, and complete disregard for passenger safety and belongings make this a company to avoid at all costs. There are plenty of reputable airlines out there that value their customers and strive to provide a pleasant and safe travel experience. Don't make the same mistake I did - look elsewhere for your next flight.

### "The worst flight experience"
The worst flight experience in my life. Several times booked the flight flyone and in each case it was awful. With a huge delay, no excuses from the company employees. No reply (email or phone).

### "I didn't check in online"
Not Verified | Terrible airline, never use it. I didn't check in online, and later check in at the airport costed me almost 50 USD. Airline seems cheaper when you buy tickets, but later you pay much more. Second flight was delayed almost 9 hours. No any food or any care provided during the delay. When you enter the aircraft, they do not turn on air-conditioning, until everyone boarded and engine started, so there is mid July heat and everyone is melting during boarding, especially if it is full flight.

### "Worst experience ever"
Not Verified |  Worst experience ever. There is no legroom, seats are not comfortable. The most horrible thing is that the flight got delayed for 3-4 hours with no clear explanation. It's not our fault was the answer all the time. I better spend more money rather than choosing this airline again!

### "Fly with literally anyone else"
The flight out of Yerevan was delayed by 1hr30 with no reason given. 5 of us missed our connection (still with FlyOne) to Luton. Everyone from the airline had gone home. We had to stay in the airport overnight and arrange our own onward travel as the next flight was in 2 days. We were told we'd be refunded, but after six weeks, numerous emails and numerous overseas phone calls I haven't got a penny back. I've been told the flight wasn't delayed and that I was lying. I've been told, in order to qualify for a refund, I needed to put the refund request in whilst I was up all night in the airport trying frantically to get home, not 2 days later. Every person I've spoken to on their customer support line has either hung up on me or said they'll ring me back but not a single person has. I can't stress enough how bad this experience was. Fly with literally anyone else. Walking across the continent on my hands would have been a more pleasant experience.

### "No compensation was given"
FLYONE Our flight was postponed three times - for a day, again for a day and for 6 hours. Then the flight was cancelled. The hotel was not provided. Can you imagine - wait for several days at the airport? Other flights from Chisinau by FLYONE were also cancelled. No compensation was given for the build. Other passengers whom we met at the airport said that even before that it was normal for them (FLYONE) to postpone flights for a day. I will not buy tickets for this airline again. It is also important to insure your trip.

### "never fly with them again"
Not Verified |  The rudest people I’ve seen. I would never fly with them again. They charge you additional costs for check in! They changed our flight, and their system didn’t recognize our booking anymore. I called them and ask and they said do the check in in airport, for which they asked an additional 6 euros. Since we didn’t book the additional luggage, they charged us 125 euros for a 20 kg package. Their office was extremely rude and was not helpful.

### "Avoid this company if you can"
It is faster to travel by bus. My 30 min flight was delayed for 9 hours, when it's 5 hours travel by bus. My previous flight was delayed for 4 hours. Avoid this company if you can

### "Avoid this airline if you can"
Avoid this airline if you can. There are other airlines on same routes which even maybe cheaper. I purchased a return flight with them from Brussels to Chisinau. Some days before my departure I was informed that my flight is cancelled, I was offered new dates at least one week later, which was not acceptable to me. So I had to buy another ticket on another route: from Chisinau to Dusseldorf. More over, when I arrived to Chisinau the handle of my suitcase was broken. I declared it at the airport on my arrival, took some pictures and sent all this to the airline. Then I got their answer, under false pretext they refuse to reimburse the damage.

### "late check-in is 30 euros per person"
Not Verified |  Cheap and certainly NOT cheerful. This airline is the worst airline I have ever flown. If you are not extremely early in arriving at the check-in desk, they refuse to provide you with your ticket unless you take a trip across the airport to a tax office and pay a fee of 30 Euros. They claim that this is a fee for late check-in. The office where I had to pay the fee does not accept card payments. I therefore had to travel again to another side of the airport to an ATM, wasting more time. All in all, it took me half and hour to sort this and I only made the flight because it was delayed. Also, when paying the fee in Turkish Lira, they then up-the price even further without telling us beforehand. So we paid more in Turkish Lira than we would have paid in Euros, despite this being Turkey. The price for late check-in is 30 euros per person. I thought it was suspicious when I was booking my ticket online and they automatically add pointless extras for an extra cost without you having asked for them, so you have to navigate back through the booking form to uncheck all of the boxes.

### "last time that I use this company"
Worst company ever, at the beginning you could have a sandwich with a cup of tea or water, or juice, now all that for money, that was the beginning. Last and worst experience was a canceled flight, useless customer support, no one is responsible, you have to buy another ticket, with you're money, they've turned +/- 80% of my money. Result, flight day changed with means weekend home like an idiot, i had to change the flight company, airport 100km from the right one, -3 days of vacation lost. It was the last time that I use this company for sure!

### "Avoid at all costs"
This is an awful company. They cancelled and changed my flights twice at short notice, causing me to miss my entire holiday. They refused to apologise or refund, and will not honour a very simple request for a letter explaining what happened. The customer service team is rude and if you try to engage with them on social media they block you. Avoid at all costs.

### "Your fare is non-refundable"
Booked a flight on Friday, July 01. On Thu, June 30, 9:02 PM got an email "FLYONE Your flight was rearranged", with new flight date on Mon, 04 July 2022, which of course was a total disaster for me. I've already booked new flights and hotels among several Turkey cities (Istanbul, Adana, Mersin). So, just after receiving this email about flight cancellation, of course I had to book another flight on 1 July, with a much higher ticket price. But it's not an end of story. The same evening, of course I visited FLYONE, chose the option to refund money for my ticket, and got the confirmation email, that my reservation was canceled. So, after 20 days I still didn't get my money back. Wrote an email to their support, asking when will I get my money back, and got the next answer: "Your fare is non-refundable. Is it legal in any way?

### "just stress and uncertainty"
The accuracy of scheduling is catastrophic: out of four flights I’ve taken with this airline in the past month, all four of them were delayed, with delays ranging from one to five hours. Only once have I been notified in advance (if the previous day counts as “in advance”) — the other three times I learned about the delay while being at the airport already. It feels like they’re doing this on purpose, yet they don’t allow delays of more than six hours so they can avoid providing accommodation, etc. I’d say it is safe to fly with this company only if you  don’t have a connecting flight,  don’t care too much about the time of arrival, and have something to entertain yourself with at the airport — otherwise it’s just stress and uncertainty.

### "The seats were cramped"
A week before departure I was notified that the flight was cancelled. I had the option to fly the following day or to get a refund. I took the first option which meant staying and paying for an extra night in Dublin and loosing a night in Chisinau. The flight itself is three and a half hours. The seats were cramped but no worse than any other low fare carrier in the European market. On the FlyOne website they state 'In addition to the free of charge onboard catering (a wide range of double sandwiches, hot and cold drinks) offered on all FLYONE flights we are glad to offer our Meal Pre-Order service. There was no complimentary catering the night I flew and no mention of why it had been curtailed. There was however a buy on board coffee and sandwich service that ran out of both coffee and sandwiches before they got to my row (26, so still quite far from the back). When I asked about the catering issues, the staff just shrugged this issue off and sat in their galley chatting for the rest of the flight.
