### "Avoid at all costs"
Not Verified |  Awful! Shenzhen Airlines cancelled my partner's flight back from Bangkok to Shenzhen to Heathrow without any explanation, refund or optional flight. Since then we've been fighting with them constantly to get at least a refund, without success. Avoid at all costs.

### "cabin crew tells me to be quiet"
I have never encountered a cabin crew who repeatedly tells me to be quiet because I’m speaking too loudly until this flight! It was a very noisy and old plane. The passenger next to me and I started chatting. This seemed to really annoy one member of the crew for some reason! IFE was awful and consisted of a handful of very old films in Mandarin. Food was ok, prawns were an unusual choice for an airline. The apple juice was either off or some kind of super budget brand. Horrible.

### "overall a good experience"
Not Verified |   The flight was a very good price, the plane was in great shape, and the cabin crew were excellent. The food could have been better and they ran out of wine quite early, but overall a good experience and I'd definitely fly with them again. If you have a layover book a lounge at Shenzhen airport; the food was good and the shower (included in the price) made a massive difference to a long journey.

### "worst airline I’ve ever encountered"
Shenzhen Airlines is the worst airline I’ve ever encountered. I had a flight from Singapore to Barcelona with a connection in Shenzhen, and the entire experience was a disaster. First, I was told by their staff in Singapore that I would miss my connection due to a delay, forcing me to buy a new, expensive ticket to make it to Barcelona on time. After spending a lot of money, I found out the connection wasn’t missed after all! When I tried to get a refund, the airline refused to take responsibility. The customer service at the airport was a joke—the staff barely spoke English and seemed to mock my situation. I’ve never flown with them, and after this experience, I never will. Avoid this airline at all costs. They’ll leave you stranded and then refuse to compensate you for their mistakes.

### "Poor quality service"
Not Verified |  Poor quality service has been provided by the airline. None of the staff is aware of the foreign language which made very difficult to have a conversation. Also the airline has taken out power bank despite being having low mah giving reasons to not allow because of high power battery backup.

### "they have no service awful staff"
From the beginning dealing with them has been like hell! I’ve never been treated so badly. The staff in Hanoi when I was not understanding why to come I've been allowed to have my bags (and weigh has not changed). Awful service people And not talking about the delays. I never take this company, it doesn’t deserve to exist, they have no service awful staff.

### "Plane was 40% empty"
Price/quality is unbeatable. Airplane was on the same standard as most European Airlines and Food and service as well. Regarding the transfer in Shenzhen it works perfectly! It is a huge modern international Airport. I was advised that I could enjoy my time outside the aiport as Austria is one of 11 EU countries that are now Visa free. Went to the city with public transport and visited the KK100 Mall and St Regis. Highly recommended. Plane was 40% empty that was nice as well.

### "I would avoid Shenzhen Airlines"
Late flights, unfriendly service and I was allowed to fly to Hanoi without a visa, at which point I was sent back but the airline did not pay for my ticket. So, between delayed flights and although it was my fault for not checking to be sure I could get a visa on arrival as my friend who lives in Hanoi said I could, the airline was at fault as well for letting me fly without the proper paperwork and had I been notified in Chengdu I would need the prior visa I would have avoided having to buy a 250 usd return ticket and would have asked to be refunded the original tickets instead of spending 4 hours of flying time and 6 hours in a Vietnam airport only to be out 500 usd for a trip I was unable to take. I would avoid Shenzhen Airlines at all costs.

### "customer service is non existent"
Not Verified |  Flights are cheap for a reason. Their customer service is non existent. And when you are finally able to reach someone via phone or email, they tell you it's not their problem and to call again or write to a different email, only to get no reply or help after. Hate this flight. Never book this airline. EVER.

### "very good value for money"
Not Verified |  Airline checkin at Heathrow was long winded due to current Chinese Govt. regulations, namely there is no transit available in Shenzhen, passengers must clear immigration and customs. For non-Chinese, this necessitates obtaining Chinese 6 day visa on arrival (free of charge). As I was travelling to Cambodia, the airline had to check that visa on arrival was available to me. Staff were courteous throughout. Despite Covid 19 free certification required for entry into China, the airlines are not required to check and nobody in Shenzhen customs or immigration checked for this either. Still, it's a big risk not to have this. There is an online Chinese customs/health declaration form that must be completed before arrival in Shenzhen. To be blunt - this is a total nightmare for people in transit, as it asks questions like "where/with whom are you staying in Shenzhen? What's the address? What's the phone number? Truly Baffling as you must fill these in! Flight to Shenzhen was good. Staff were friendly and helpful. Food good. Beverages were a little limited: soft drinks, wine and beer. More could be obtained on request. IFE In Flight Entertainment in English was a little limited; just about enough for 12 hour flight. The terrible Chinese online health declaration had to be completed again for Shenzhen to Phnom Penh flight. Nightmare. Smaller 737 Aircraft. Snack boxes and beverage. No IFE. Staff again friendly. Shenzhen Airline's websites are terrible. No better than useless. Customer service via email - if you're lucky enough to find one - also useless. Overall, flight very good value for money - but it's not Air New Zealand or Qatar Airways.

### "The flight was a bargain"
London to Hanoi via Shenzhen. Boarding was a little prolonged and we were called to the gate much earlier than needed on the London - Shenzhen leg. Both of my flights left slightly late. The crew were friendly, seat was comfortable and food was surprisingly good considering. We had two full meals and drinks on the first leg, and a snack box on the second. The entertainment on the London - Shenzhen leg had enough options to satisfy me, though far fewer than other airlines. The system was modern and worked well. The Shenzhen - Hanoi leg had no entertainment. Crew announcements were hard to hear and very brief in English. Transiting in Shenzhen was as chaotic as expected, but took around an hour in total. I had to follow signs to domestic transfers, wait in a holding area to fill in some forms, through immigration, then headed upstairs to departures of my own volition. My checked bag went all the way without having to collect in Shenzhen. The flight was a bargain and I definitely would use again.

### "Transit in Shenzhen is shocking"
We flew with Shenzhen Airlines between London and Shenzhen with final destination of Singapore. The review is related only to the LHR-SZX flight. We ordered vegetarian and got vegetarian food that was tasty for airplane food. Comfortable seats with plugs and usb chargers. Extremely helpful and nice staff. The entertainment is really poor. There are only Chinese movies, music or TV series. Transit in Shenzhen is shocking for a country and city of this dimensions. I would not recommend transiting via Shenzhen until this is improved.

### "only accept Chinese credit cards"
Not Verified |  Shenzhen to London. Just got on board and asked to upgrade to business. Was told the price and agreed to pay. After 20 minutes the airline discovered they could only accept Chinese credit cards or wechat payment and international cards such as MasterCard couldn’t be used. We got kicked out of business. Very poor.

### "Never use this airline"
We were supposed to fly 10/06/2019 London - Shenzen - Kuala Lumpur. They canceled our flight Shenzen - Kuala Lumpur and give us another flight, but with 15 hours delay. Nobody in Shenzen Airport speaks English! After few hours and arguing we get a hotel, no water, no food! 23/06/2019 Kuala Lumpur - Shenzen - London. They also canceled our flight from Kuala Lumpur to Shenzen just few days before departure. They offered us to fly totally different day through different city (Singapore, where we had to arrive on our own!) , which was unacceptable for us. We were willing to buy ticket from Kuala Lumpur to Shenzen by ourselves and use their flight from Shenzen to London, but they denied to check us in to this single flight. Overall, first flight - 15 hours delayed, night in hotel in really bad conditions without food and beverages, necessity to buy different flight and our expenses on calls to their useless customers service. After all we were asking for some compensation for this horrible experience and according to their manager there is no compensation. They send us refund for canceled flight which was no near the half of the price of this ticket. Never use this airline.

### "required to have China Visa"
Singapore to Shenzen. Our booking this year for our annual trip to  destinations in Asia involved a return flight from Maldives to Singapore, Shenzen, and finally LA. The booking did NOT give us any indication that transfer via Shenzen will require an entry visa and complete customs process, immigration control and re-checking in. Shenzen Airlines food is lousy, weird Chinese option that my wife and I did not eat. Entertainment consisted of watching tiny ceiling mounted screens which require everyone to watch the same program which was Chinese material. Business Class seats were the same ones we get for a basic flight from LA say to San Francisco, except this is a five hour flight. Then there was the surprise upon arrival that we are required to have China Visa. We had been told our luggage would go directly to LA and there had been no mention of visa requirements. This involved about a dozen people. Other than the airline person who dumped us off at passport control, nobody spoke English: from the officer who got our passports and disappeared for about 25 minutes, to the immigration office who then stamped my passport and my wife's passport with the wrong sticker (visa is a sticker with name of holder and the name on it must match information on passport's photo page data. So the entire process had to be repeated. This also involved finger printing of all digits, email, US email address and phone number. Then we had to figure out mostly on our own how to get our luggage back, and take it to check in. After check in, we crawled our way to security check in which had a large line. They discovered via electronic transmission from check in area to security screening that there were batteries on our luggage and required us a stop by the inspection area. We had to wait for retrieval of our luggage and someone to inspect it, and that too took about half an hour. The few words they were able to tell us in response to my visible anger was - Sir, you have battery! Battery problem! We dive, we have lighting gear for dives and photography that are too heavy to add to carry on. So they had us empty our luggage to inspect the batteries. By the time we went through a second screening, I was so livid I was yelling at everyone at security. When we were done, we had wasted our 3 hours layover. By then I was so heated and sweaty, the only thing I wanted was to get a shower before our 12 hour flight to LA. Get this I was able to do it because flight was delayed by a.5 hours! So we used our additional time to shower at the business class lounge. Shenzen Airlines lounge had no showers, and the Priority Pass lounge near it had no towels. I showered there and dried myself up with my own polo shirt!

### "caused me to lose tickets"
I bought return tickets London to Jakarta via Shenzhen. My trip from London to Jakarta in March was alright, yet I could not make it back. Shenzhen Airlines unprofessional gestures have caused me to lose the return flight. I tried to call and e-mail them to resolve the problem, but they never answered. It started with their flight cancellation on the 5th May from Jakarta to Shenzhen. After much hustles and hours waiting at the airport, the airline (through the Travel Agency) confirmed to transfer me with SC for Jakarta - Shenzhen flight on the 8th May, to continue with SA to London on the same day. I came to the airport in Jakarta on the 8th May for my flights, only for getting rejected to board by SC check-in crew because I don’t have Chinese transit visa, although I have valid UK Visa. I didn’t know that I needed it because according to my previous experience flying from London to Jakarta transferring in Shenzhen, the immigration could give me, Indonesian passport holder, a 24hr entry permit without problem. The officers threatened me that if I would’ve not been allowed to enter Shenzhen without visa by the Chinese immigration, I had to be repatriated and buy my own ticket back to Jakarta. In short, I missed the flight to Shenzhen for this. The next day I called the Chinese Embassy, they said that Indonesian passport holder may enter Shenzhen for 24hr free. I tried to call Shenzhen Airlines to confirm about the correct policy and ask about their procedure in this case, but they never answered my phone or e-mail. Shenzhen Airlines final words to me was given through travel agency, saying that they cancelled my flights for no show and couldn’t change or refund it. I think it was an unprofessional gesture from SA since it wasn’t my fault to miss the flight. They made a mistake by cancelling their own flights at first place, passed me to an airlines that demanded me a transit visa to fly with them, yet Shenzhen Airlines never instructed it clearly to me, or opened their communication line with the client in trouble. This visa requirement unclear information has caused me to lose tickets, which remains unclear to me up to now. It was such a horrible and traumatising flying experience.

### "Staff can’t speak English"
Not Verified |  I never fly with them before, so the only reason I was book with was the open tickets of going back to London. The worst experience in my life. The flight was 9:10pm and it was cancelled at midnight they put on the screen that it is cancelled. No communication, no customer service, no offers food and drink from 11/04/2019 at 9:10pm till the next yesterday we on the new flight on 12/04/2019 at 9am. Staff can’t speak English, shouting at Customers. The connection flight from Shenzhen airport, you will need to go out and back in to get your connection flight. So if you buy stuff in duty-free And put in your luggage and you go over 3kg it cost you €52 for 3 kg even them cancel your flight. I will never fly again with Shenzhen airlines.

### "the worst experience"
London to Bangkok via Shenzhen. Pretty much the worst experience I had on a plane. Staff where highly incompetent, flight attendants where unprepared, the seats were extra small, on-board entertainment was a joke, I mean, there where only 4 movies and all Chinese. Try to avoid.

### "return flight was terrible"
Not Verified |  London to Shenzhen. Normally travel to Shenzhen via Hong Kong and was delighted to see this direct route to Shenzhen but unfortunately the return flight was terrible, food terrible, no in flight entertainment, cabin crew English not good enough, first class seating terrible. My thoughts are that Shenzhen airlines are just picking off the local traffic from Hong Kong, if they want to serve the western countries they need to prepare better. Would not recommend this service to anyone, back to Emirates who hold the mark for top class service.

### "the worst Asian airline"
Not Verified |  Hanoi to Shenzhen. This is the worst Asian airline that I have ever flown with. The check-in personnel had almost no English skills. I was charged 75 USD for three kilograms of excess baggage and charged the same amount a second time as I transferred from Shenzhen to Hanoi. No apology or explanation was offered about why I needed to check my baggage out and then in again between the two legs of the journey, even though it was the same airline. We sat on the ground and listened to repetitious safety announcements made by a recording of a pathetic English translator. The scrap of food that was offered was abominable (a cold hot dog on a white bun smothered with ketchup). I would never fly with them again.

### "it was delayed for hours"
Bangkok to Shenzhen. 40 blankets for 120 seats. Get it together. It’s not that difficult to manufacture some blankets. Hair on the seats and dirty windows. On my way to Thailand from Shenzhen, it was delayed for hours and everyone expected that. It’s a sad thing when your airline is known, and expected, to be awful.

### "smooth and pleasant"
Xian to Xiamen in November 2017. Check in at Xian was hassle free. A320 without personal IFE. A drop down LED monitor is fitted on every subsequent 3 rows. The quality of the flight catering is similar to some other airlines in China, taste is average but the portion was sufficient. To conclude, the flight journey was a smooth and pleasant one.

### "airline is a real nightmare"
Not Verified |  Guangzhou to Nanjing. I just tried to fly with them. My flight was cancelled without a real reason and the ground staff was the worst I ever experienced. I´ve been told that there is something wrong with my ticket and so they can´t switch me to another flight. Lufthansa confirmed thet everything was fine with my ticket but Shenzhen Air did not accept. Now I try to reach them for weeks without any reaction. This airline is a real nightmare.

### "first class service was amiable"
Beijing to Shenzhen on a Boeing 737. First class a total of eight seats, two rows, four groups, the first day of the first class of passengers a total of four people, so each person sitting on the side. Because the narrow body aircraft fly, the seat can not lie flat, but Shenzhen Airlines first class seats are very spacious. The flight attendant who was in charge of first class service was amiable. And the release of meals, but also to ask whether the need for chili sauce, mustard and other side dishes. The seats do not have a screen, but first class passengers can get a Tablet PC, which has movies, TV shows and other entertainment, the headphone jack bad contact, affecting the listening effect. After the arrival of the plane, the crew will maintain the order on board, so that first class passengers first off the plane, I love Shenzhen Airlines, of course, if it can be wide body aircraft like. Service did not say that food can also hope that the food can do better and more refined. Drinks also hope to be more advanced.

### "no signs of priority check-in"
Shenzhen to Xi'an. It took me 10 minutes to find first class check-in while there was no signs of priority check-in in the terminal, which is quite strange for me while Shenzhen airport is hub airport of Shenzhen Airlines. Check-in and security were efficient. Lounges were comfortable and food tasteful. Flight attendants friendly and attentive. First class seats on this short haul flight was great. Recommended.

### "impolite to their passengers"
Shubuling to Shenzhen. However did Star Alliance admit this low quality airline into their more prestigious alliance? The website is absolutely awful in English and in Chinese. After failing to purchase a ticket through their website, I managed to buy one on Ctrip. But then the online check-in did would not work. However the verification function on the Chinese language website reassured me that my ticket did exist. Airport check-in was ok as I was first in line. However then the flight was delayed by an hour, then after boarding an announcement of another half hour, then half an hour later yet another delay. I wondered if it was a ploy to avoid paying compensation and why they just did not let us deplane and wait in the lounge. Being vegetarian I would have needed to pre-order my special meal, but as web check in was not available I was not able to order. The only positive was one very polite and helpful stewardess, whom my translator guessed wanted to please the foreign guest, as the flight crew was otherwise quite impolite to their passengers. In flight entertainment: Heidi, a German language film on a screen too distant to read the subtitles.

### "never, ever is this flight on time"
I use Shenzhen Airlines 2 time per week from Shenzhen to Jinjiang and back. Never, ever is this flight on time. Delay 1 hour, 2 hours, and last monday a delay of 3 hours. How is it possible? And there isn't other choice, this is the only flight available for to go and come back. Maybe this is the reason: only this flight, only this airline and they think they can do what they want.

### "standing during turbulence"
I've been taking Shenzhen Airlines frequently, and the experience today in ZH9149 was not as good as usual. During the flight a woman from economy class went to the first class area and sit by me, chatting with a guy and a kid, who sat in the same row with me. Most of the time she was standing in the aisle even during turbulence. Even worse, she used mobile phone to take pics for the kid. This behavior is dangerous and it happened at least three times during the flight. But there was no cabin crew stopping her all the time.

### "no incentive to take care of customers"
First time with this airline flying from Shenzhen to Shanghai, and it was not a positive one. Shenzhen Airlines one of those state owned airlines in China (part of Air China) that has no incentive to take care of its customers. Shenzhen airport was impressive and comfortable, but as soon as we arrived at the boarding gate, however, nightmare started. For an airport that spacious and modern, Shenzhen Airlines's plane that took us to Shanghai was parked far far away and it takes a long while for the shuttle bus to get there. We boarded the crowded bus and there was no air conditioning with temperature outside reaching 35+c. We had to wait on the bus for several minutes with everyone sweating like hell before the bus moved. After a seemingly very long ride, we arrived at our plane that was parked at a remote corner in front of a maintenance shop. We boarded the plan and our nightmare continued. There was no aircpn switched on onboard the plane. The pilot informed us that due to air traffic control, we had to wait on the plane for further instructions. A flight attendant came over and asked if we wanted blankets. Looking at her sweat covered face, I am like what .. a blanket! Did you say blanket? She was just doing her job. But the entire crew did not seem to get it.

### Shenzhen Airlines customer review
Flew from Osaka to Beijing. We got to airport 2 hours early, but check-in hadn't started yet. The minute we were supposed to board the airplane, our flight got delayed for 1.5 hours, which was very annoying.

### Shenzhen Airlines customer review
Flew Shenzhen to Beijing Capital on Boeing 737-900. Whilst I guess its quite a new plane, the interior was quite grubby with surface stains and scratches to panels and seat areas. The flight was delayed due to traffic but that's normal in China. Lounge at Shenzhen Airport in need of further change if they want to meet international standards, as its geared to Chinese only. Staff onboard were quite efficient, but language skills very poor and didn't understand anything that appears to not be on their script - a bit scary! Food is also geared of course to Chinese passengers, and wasn't good even by Chinese standards. There's not a lot of options for this route, but will go back to using Hainan Airlines whenever I can for domestic as they are miles ahead of all the other airlines here.

### Shenzhen Airlines customer review
Shenzhen to Xi'an. Only foreigner on board got all the attention of the flight attendants - limitless alcohol. Very helpful in general with good English skills. They served dinner which was very reasonable. Check - in was done quickly professional and put a "fragile" sticker on my suitcase without me having to ask for it. All in all a very good travel experience.

### Shenzhen Airlines customer review
PEK-NNG in Airbus 320. Flight was delayed due to air traffic control the plane was 30% full I was able to sleep and stretch out using the 3 seats. Cabin Attendant courteous and helpful food was inedible though a mysterious chicken noodle or spaghetti? Overall value for money and I can redeem points using my Air China Star Alliance card.

### Shenzhen Airlines customer review
Domestic flight from Guiyang to Shenzen. Flight delayed for 3 hours and everyone sat onboard with nothing to do. Luckily they served one meal while we were waiting which was good. When we asked if there were any coke or snacks they said no which was quite disappointing. Food and seat were ok. FA kept us informed about the delay. Not much inflight entertainment except for tiny TV's on the ceiling.

### Shenzhen Airlines customer review
Shenzhen to Xiamen. On arrival at Shenzhen Airport I was surprised to find it resemble more of a Chinese railway station than an international airport. Check in was quick. I used the automatic machines with the help of a staff who spoke almost no English. Was charged a fee for overweight luggage which was expected. Onboard the cabin seats were adequate. Was given a snack - a muffin peanuts and a tangerine along with water. Was glad to have something to eat but expected a hot meal. At Xiamen luggage arrived quickly and everything went smoothly. All in all Shenzhen Airlines was quite nice. Quite clean and quite efficient.

### Shenzhen Airlines customer review
First time flying SZ. Flew from TPE-WUX. Business class seat was not worth the money. Meal was poor. Pulled out my iphone mid flight to listen to music and was told I couldn't use a mobile phone during the flight even in airplane mode. After we landed there was no process to let first/business class disembark first. People in economy rushed to the front preventing first/business passengers from getting their belongings to disembark.

### Shenzhen Airlines customer review
Shenzhen - Shanghai Hong Qiao. Delayed for 1 hr due to late arrival of previous flight but information was sufficient. Seat condition okay with a lot of legroom meal service the best I've ever experienced on flights in China. A large range of drinks. Flight attendants friendly and seemed professional.

### Shenzhen Airlines customer review
ICN to SZX - worst flight experience I have ever endured. The one piece of good review I can give is that the flight landed at the intended destination. Messy cramped disorganized - and that is just a description of the boarding process. I know it's a cultural thing but the sense of personal space is nil - no way to relax on the flight. Got stuck in economy though I booked biz class. Offered to pay to "reupgrade" and was told I could pay cash to cabin crew - $500!

### Shenzhen Airlines customer review
WUH to CKG on an A320. Flight on time even a little early. Clean cabin appearance seat pitch good. Food/snack a little disappointment nothing salty just sweets. FA in good mood and friendly.

### Shenzhen Airlines customer review
Shenzhen to Jinan early morning flight peak for departures at SZX however Self-Check in machines available and efficient. No jetways so bussed to quite a distance away. Clean 737-800 with friendly crew. Hot meal was served for breakfast which is nice. Got to Jinan on time. Recommend the airline for flights in China better services than many larger airlines in the country.

### Shenzhen Airlines customer review
Hangzhou to Shenzhen in economy. Check in was a breeze airport is modern. Flight wasn't full so able to move seats and not have a person next to me. Seats were fine decent recline. Food was terrible noodles with some ground pork and sauce. All in all flight was fine because it was short and on time. Flight attendants seemed professional. But drinks and food were quite bad even for a chinese airline.

### Shenzhen Airlines customer review
Shenzhen-Dalian C class. Good quick check in with attentive check in staff. Used the business and first class aisle to fast track security otherwise it would have taken ages to clear security. The Business class lounge was very comfortable and spacious with free drinks and nibbles plenty of TVs computer terminals and newspapers to read. The plane was clean seating in business class comprised of 3 rows with 2 seats on each side of the aisle. Food and drinks were plentiful with the flight attendants providing a very good service. Flight announcements by both the flight crew and cabin staff were firstly in Chinese and then English.

### Shenzhen Airlines customer review
Nanjing - Chongqing. Used this China internal flight cost around £55 2 hours long and on time. Offered good hot food with a smile and free drink to ups throughout. English not understood that well by lovely attendant but acceptable as was a internal flight. Overall very surprised by quality considering this is a budget airline.

### Shenzhen Airlines customer review
CAN-KWL-CAN (Guangzhou-Guilin) return by Shenzhen Airlines. 50mins flight offer breakfast with a small break fruit and tea. Aircraft in good condition but a little bit old cabin quite clean FA's service and attitude fare. Inflight announcement in Mandarin cantonese English and Japanese(a group of Japanese visitors). In my opinion Shenzhen airline's quality raise faster than other chinese carriers.

### Shenzhen Airlines customer review
Shenzhen - Chongqing and Shenzhen - Wuhan with Shenzhen Airlines. The first leg to on an A320 the other two legs on 737-800s. Aircraft in a good condition. Hot meals served. On all longer routes Shenzhen Airlines also provide mints shortly before landing which helps to overcome the uncomfortable feeling in the ears. In my experience Shenzhen Airlines provides a better level of service than any other Chinese carriers.

### Shenzhen Airlines customer review
SZX/JDZ return. Did the same trip 7 months ago and was put off by average service and an old and dirty 737. Have just completed the same trip and what a turn around. Aircraft spotless with cleaners still scrubbing doors just prior to boarding. Aircrew immaculately dressed groomed and attentive. Meal was hot and tasty. This airline has certainly got its act together and considering they have a monopoly on the route provided a level of service above what I expected.

### Shenzhen Airlines customer review
Shenzhen - XiAn and back. This is the second time I have flown Shenzhen Airlines. The economy class is comfortable. Seat width better than other Chinese carriers. Legspace great for a foreigner. Meals and drinks were adequate. Flight staff friendly and helpful. At least 2 flight attendant's spoke English. Inflight announcements in Chinese and English. Interesting that towards end of flight flight attendants encourage all passengers to do head neck arm and leg exercises. Very happy with service from check-in to disembarkation and will choose Shenzhen airlines again.

### Shenzhen Airlines customer review
PEK to SZX. Check in fast and efficient. Boarding on time but by bus instead of jetway as the aircraft was parked in apron far from terminal which is not good in freezing Beijing weather of about -10 C in the morning. Aircraft 737-900 and clean. Non of two choices of food was so good: boiled rice or noodle with boiled vegetables with no taste or spice - or even salt. Plenty of drinks served two times. Crew very kind and efficient. Arrival on time.

### Shenzhen Airlines customer review
Guanzhou to Guilin. The aircraft was a very clean and new looking Boeing 737-800. The announcements were in Chinese and English. The flight departed and arrived early. Things are changing rapidly in China and standards seem to be rising generally. The snack was uninspired but most UK carriers give nothing on a 45 minute flight.

### Shenzhen Airlines customer review
I flew Shenzhen airliines twice in January and February 2006. The first flight was Nanjing - Shenzhen. The service was adequate though one of the FAs was going so fast with the drinks trolley that she knocked right into me spilling coffee all over my leg ; no apology even though she clearly saw what she had done she just giggled and rushed away. The second flight Shenzhen - Changzhou on an Airbus A320. The flight departed on time and everything was going fine until half way through the flight when the captain announced something in Chinese which caused quite a stir amongst the other passengers (I was the only foreigner). After speaking for maybe 90 seconds in Chinese he simply said "Ladies and Gentlemen we back Shenzhen. Medical Emergency" This seemed odd as we were now far closer to other airports such as Changsha Nanchang Hangzhou Hefei Wuhan etc. than we were to Shenzhen. When we eventually arrived back in Shenzhen there was no rushing to get a sick passenger off the place so it clearly was not a medical emergency. They started to hand out food boxes - some passengers were given two but when it came to the foreigner on the flight - nothing. Meiyou. Sorry. Then another announcement in Chinese and everyone starts to rush off the plane. I ask what the problem and in broken English the answer is "We clean the plane". So after an hour on the tarmac we are told to get back on - once again I ask what the problem was and the answer was they had to clean the plane. I try to get them to elaborate but the FAs English was dreadful. We finally arrived in Changzhou 5 hours late. Shenzhen Airlines are the worst domestic Chinese airline I've flown.

### Shenzhen Airlines customer review
A total surprise and a pleasant one with Shenzhen Airlines. Flew from Wuhan to Shenzhen in mid March. Half expected sloppy service and really scared about safety. Instead got a brand new 737-800 with leather seats in Y-class. Flight hostesses very polite and warm and helpful. Plenty of them too. Cabin service complete with drinks and meals. Professionally looking inflight magazine.

### Shenzhen Airlines customer review
This was the first time flew Shenzhen Airlines. Economy tends to be comfortable enough. On the SZX-HAK flight B737-600 - approximately 1 hour flight with snacks and mineral water only no other choice like coke. FA's services attitudes are fair. On the HAK-SZX return flight one of the FA was kind of bullied by two passengers but the FA was very polite and asked the passenger to be seated for landing. Overall Shenzhen airlines are good enough for economy travel on domestic routes.
