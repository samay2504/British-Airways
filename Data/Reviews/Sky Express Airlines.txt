### "attitude of the staff was poor"
I travelled to Athens for a week with my nine year old son. No problems getting there. A flawless trip. However, on the return date at the check in desk in Athens airport, I was told I needed the written consent of my ex wife to fly my own son home to the UK. Having already been allowed into Greece by the same airline and spent a week there, I was baffled. My son has the same surname as me and I have 50/50 full time joint custody of him without any court interference or documents at all. Horrified, I thought they wouldn't let us on the flight. They wanted me to contact my ex wife at 5 a.m U.K time to get written permission from her by email. None of this was reasonable then and there. Permission was sought from somebody with a new remarried surname who could have been anybody just to say I could take my own son home. Not into Greece, home; with his own father. None of us here are Greek in any way, everybody has UK passports. Thank god my ex wife had her phone on at 5 a.m. The attitude of the staff was poor. I was robotically refered twice to the websites policy on this nonsense. Ok, a policy is there, but why on earth would anybody think this is an actual thing? Especially on a return home flight. Google it, theres not a lot out there for this. I had to ask to see a manager (i'm not normally one of those people) to get anywhere with this and then get my ex wife to email Sky Express to bail us out. We flew home but I'm pretty sure had I been female this wouldn't have become such an issue.

### "no on board WiFi"
There is no on board WiFi for a non domestic flight. The price for overweight kilos was 9 Euro per kilo because of "high season" even though the clerk told me 6. He didn't even know it until he checked the computer. Outrageous. A joke of a cookie as onboard meal for a non domestic flight. Just use another airline no matter the cost it's not worth it.

### "Avoid if at all possible"
Sky Express left checked bags on our flight at the departure airport. There were 10 or 12 of us lined up to report missing luggage after we arrived at ATH. We tried to get Sky Express to forward our bags to several of the port stops on our cruise, but they failed to respond in a timely manner for us to collect the bags. Instead we had to buy clothes when the ship made port stops. Initially, they denied any responsibility to forward the bags to our home, so I had to threaten them with legal action. After one month, the bags arrived at our home airport. It was quite difficult getting any response from them. Avoid if at all possible, unless you only have carry on.

### "not rembursed yet"
Overbooked flight. I was denied embarkment. No support from Sky airline and not reimbursed yet (2x250 Euro as law requires). Customer support told me 3 times that reimbursement should come soon. This company shall not have the right to fly! !

### "ordeal has been incredibly stressful"
Not Verified |  I recently had the most frustrating and shocking experience with Sky Express. On May 30th, I booked two tickets from Mykonos to Athens to Frankfurt for September 1st. The booking process was smooth, and I received my confirmation immediately. However, things took a turn for the worse as my travel date approached. On August 31st, I attempted to check in online, only to receive an error stating that my confirmation number was for a flight in the past. I was in shock! I immediately called the airline, and after waiting for 40 minutes, I finally spoke with a representative who informed me that my flight was cancelled, then put me on hold for another 10 minutes. When she returned, she told me that I had supposedly changed my flight on August 6th to a business class ticket from Athens to Frankfurt on August 7th. This was absolutely impossible, as I never made any such change. The agent promised to investigate and get back to me. Shortly after, I received an email from Sky Express, which left me in utter disbelief. According to their records, I had requested this change at the Athens airport. This was a complete fabrication. To make matters worse, they informed me that I needed to book a new ticket from Mykonos to Frankfurt, as my original ticket could not be modified. I was in a state of panic, as I had a connecting flight from Frankfurt to JFK and then to Fort Lauderdale the following day. With no other option, I had to book a new ticket with a different airline, costing me an outrageous $1,625. I have since emailed Sky Express, demanding reimbursement for the original fare and compensation for the new tickets I was forced to purchase. This whole ordeal has been incredibly stressful and has left me with a deep mistrust of Sky Express. I strongly advise against booking with Sky Express. Their lack of communication, errors, and refusal to take responsibility for their actions have been nothing short of a nightmare. Save yourself the headache and choose a more reliable airline.

### “airline has no reliability”
BE VERY AWARE! This airline has no reliability at all. In order to cope with overbooking, they avoid cunningly to call at the gate already checked passengers who are even slightly delayed. Their seats are then quickly given to other passengers with confirmed reservation, so that the air carrier has not to compensate them! Delayed for about 5 min by safety control procedures (but 15 min before departure at the gate), we were formally refused boarding, had our luggage unloaded from the plane and were obliged to buy a new one-way ticket on the next flight to Kefalonia.

### "no one to solve your problem"
Not Verified | My boss forgot his passport on the airline. I phoned the airline 4 times. Had to wait 10 minutes to answer my call and in 2 of them the attendant hang up the phone. THey don't have ANY structure and they charge as a "full company". NO help desk service - LONG waiting time and no one to solve your problem.

### “aircraft was old but clean, and comfortable”
I flew in one of Sky Express's ATR-72 aircraft from Kythira to Athens. The ground staff at Kythira airport and flight attendants were very friendly and professional. The aircraft was old but clean, and comfortable enough. Boarding was completed on time and the door closed. That the take-off was delayed by an hour was not the airline's fault. A clearly annoyed pilot explained that there was some sort of lightning air traffic control strike, at least that is what the other passengers told me because the explanation given by the clearly annoyed pilot was given only in Greek. Otherwise the flight was perfectly enjoyable and I have no complaints about the airline. Inflight service on the 30-minute flight consisted of a pre-departure sweet, a bottle of water and a small biscuit.

### "I request a refund"
Not Verified |   Flight from Heraklion airport to Athens International Airport on June 13th. My flight was delayed; no reason was given, and I also had an issue with checking in. My flight was delayed by just under 2 hours, and the later flight was scheduled for me; no other choice was given to me. I request a refund due to the inconvenience caused by the delay and lack of communication. Additionally, I would appreciate it if you could provide an explanation for the check-in issue that occurred. I called the help desk on June 12 to inquire about an earlier flight but was informed that I'm not eligible for it. I also sent an email requesting the earlier flight at the same time. Due to this issue, I missed my reservation on the other side. Additionally, I received an email from Sky Express on the 13th at 12:46, inquiring if I would prefer an earlier flight at 15.40. I received the email too late, which didn't allow us enough time to reach the airport. I am extremely dissatisfied with the entire situation, and the flight back from Athens to Gatwick on June 16th. My luggage was badly damaged, which I did provide with the image that I took at the airport. I have been told by the airline customer service that, due to a lack of evidence, my claim is not going to be processed. I'm not impressed with your reply. Very poor customer service and lack of communication from Sky Express.

### “the service is unacceptable”
Terrible experience, huge delays. It’s the third time flying with this airline and the service is unacceptable. The staff was completely unable to inform us regarding the delays or deal with any of the comments of the frustrated passengers who waited over 2 hours and another 20 minutes into the still, not moving transfer bus. Definately would not recommend.

### “disheartened by the experience”
I am deeply disheartened by the experience at the boarding gate. The gentleman working there exhibited an appalling level of rudeness towards both myself and my nine-year-old daughter. She was momentarily delayed in handing over her boarding pass, and his response was not only disrespectful but also entirely inappropriate. Such behavior towards a child is unacceptable. I urge the management to address this matter promptly to ensure better treatment of passengers in the future.

### "More than 1 hour delay"
1 hour delay from Athens to Santorini. More than 1 hour delay from Santorini to Athens. I am right now inside the plane and they don't even turn on the engines to turn the air conditioner on. It's almost 40 degrees Celsius outside.

### "not be compensated"
We - 2 adults and 2 children up to 7 years old - flew to Athens with Sky Express for the first time in March. Our experience was more than bad and that's why we will never fly with this airline again, despite the sometimes cheaper prices. The online check-in process was relatively complicated but that didn't bother us too much. The problem was that despite having children, we couldn't get seats next to each other! The hotline and airport staff couldn't help us. On the plane, we realized that we weren't the only ones with this issue. That's why the boarding process took about an hour until everyone on the plane found a seat next to their children or family members. The worst thing, however, was that on the return journey, both of our suitcases arrived in Munich damaged (see photos). We immediately reported it to Aerogate, who confirmed that the suitcase was a total loss. However, the response from Sky Express customer service was that the damage was minor (such as scratches, damaged wheels, handles, etc.) and would not be compensated by the airline. We tried to explain with several photos that it was a total loss but we never received a response from customer service. We tried the airline once and will never fly with Sky Express again!

### “horrible airline and customer service”
Absolutely horrible airline and customer service experience. I have been continuously writing to SKY Express to help get reimbursed for expenses that I had to incur  because of SKY Express and delayed baggage. Their rather obnoxious customer service department keep writing back to me that they are unable to proceed with any reimbursement since 'I chose to collect my delayed baggage from the airport on my own accord'. First, the baggage didn't arrive with me on my flight from Athens to Santorini. Then, they told me that it will be delivered to my temporary residence sometime the next day. The other option they gave me is that I comeback to the airport late that night to collect my baggage as it was arriving on the next flight in to Santorini in 4 hours. How can SKY Express expect me to skip my evening tour and dinner on vacation and come back to the airport to collect the baggage to makeup for their fault? How can SKY Express expect me to skip my tour the next day AND wait for the baggage to arrive at my temporary residence? How can SKY Express expect me to manage WITHOUT my clothes? And on top of that, they are not even willing to compensate me for the inconvenience caused to me on my vacation, leave alone the stress of not getting your personal belonginngs on a Foreign Land. This is just ridiculous.

### “Horrible customer service”
I used Sky express for a flight from Brussels to Athens. When I did my online check-in, despite having an economy class ticket, I had the option of choosing a seat in the row of the emergency exit and I did (that was the in the picture of the plane that was on their website ). When I entered the plane the seats that were supposed to have no other row right infront actually had another row of seats which made these seats extremely small and uncomfortable for me. (1.90m). Another gentleman had the same issue and was promoted for free to business class whilst I due to my age or looks, was completely ignored by all staff. When I arrived I informed customer care via email and I got quite the disappointing answer, that I didn't pay anything extra for my seat and thus nothing could be done. Once again ignoring the fact that I was both discriminated for my age and looks and the fact that the picture of the plane on the website was wrong. Horrible customer service and horrible closed-minded staff. Never flying with them again. Not worth saving 50 euros for this.

### "luggage had been destroyed"
My recent ordeal with SkyExpress has left me utterly disheartened and disillusioned. What began as a journey with high hopes and expectations, ended in sheer disappointment and frustration. Upon arrival at Brussels Airport from Greece, I discovered that my new Samsonite luggage had been destroyed during transit. Despite adhering meticulously to their claims process and furnishing every piece of requested documentation, including the original form submitted at the airport, SkyExpress has remained unyielding in their refusal to acknowledge their liability. Their blasé attitude and flippant responses serve as a slap in the face to passengers who entrust them with their belongings. What's particularly galling is the stark dissonance between the information disseminated at the departure airport and the subsequent communication from their service team. It's patently evident that accountability and transparency are foreign concepts to SkyExpress, who seem to view customer satisfaction as an inconvenience rather than a priority. I threatened legal action and offered to publicize images of my ravaged suitcase across my social channels but this failed to elicit a responses.

### "Legroom horrible"
Legroom horrible, they have 4 A320 with 186 seats, 3 A320 with 180 and 2 A320 with 174 seats. Unfortunately we had the 186 seater. No wifi, they serve free only a cookie and juices. Buy Menu for sandwiches. Cabin was clean, crew was professional. We were on time.

### "flight will depart 1 hour later"
I was supposed to travel from Athens to Heraklion at 17.30 and i received an email at 10.17 am that my flight will depart 1 hour later at 18.30 "due to re-schedule on our flight program". Announcing just 5 hours before the flight that they are re-scheduling the flight? So that the delay will not count so that there will not be any compensation.

### "staff were extremely helpful"
Not Verified | First time I flew Sky Express and I am proud as a Greek to have a Greek airline like this. Very affordable prices, staff were extremely helpful and friendly with warm Greek hospitality - Flights GQ701 London to Athens and GQ700 Athens to London. Once you go Sky Express you'll never go back to Ryanair or Wizz Air.

### "Crew was friendly and professional"
Both departures were on time, planes where clean. Rows up to 9 have a pleasant legroom. Crew was friendly and professional. For 45 minutes flight, No IFE, inflight service was cookies and juices, water, coffee. With 15 euro you can have access to lounge.

### "coffee and water were free"
Not Verified |  The aircraft was brand new and the feeling during the flight was good. If you are quite tall forget about comfort during the flight. The space between the seats are for short people. During the flight coffee and water were free everything else you had to pay for. When you pay 500 euros and even more for a flight this is the least you expect. The worst thing though is their ground service. Upon arrival two of our luggage were destroyed. One completely and one could be used again. Gatwick ground services informed us that we had to fill papers and take pictures. We followed all the guidelines provided and since the 29th December they still have not got back to us. Upon departure from Gatwick they had informed us to be 3hrs prior to their flight at the airport which we did but the check in of the flight opened 2hrs before! So we had to stand for over 1hr with another 200 people to be served an hour later.

### "I was not entitled to a refund"
I flew on Sky Express from Athens to Skiathos on August 1st, 2023 (flight GQ 432). The flight was late, landed after 22.00 and my luggage was missing (it happens). at the desk I was told that they were unable to provide me with a form to fill and that I will have to come back the next day. What i did on the morning and filled the missing form (Property Irregularity Report - PIR). My luggage was found and sent back to me six (6) days later during which I had to buy first necessity items. I was then requested to fill a reimbursement form and offered an indemnity of 240 euros. Customer Service told me then that the reimbursement would take place in nine weeks following the filing. Nine  weeks later, I received nothing and after asking, I was informed that I was not entitled to a refund because i did not fill the PIR on the day of my arrival. these are very cheap methods, not acceptable at all. They first lied, then promised then took back their word. They are not reliable which is a shame for an airline company.

### "bags haven't arrived yet"
We landed at 1625 now the time is 1725 our bags haven't arrived yet. No information from the company. Worst airline. It is the second time that I have a problem with the luggage with this cheap airline.

### "payment link was sent to GoToGate"
I booked this flight in May of 2023 and mid June I was trying to purchase checked baggage online using the airline's website. Their online baggage booking service was not working and kept crashing. After 7 attempts, I emailed the airline directly to help with booking baggage as it's half the price in advance, compared to paying at the airport. It took 3 weeks for them to respond to my email (in July!). There were back and forth emails with me stating the same thing (I wanted to purchase 2 pieces of checked baggage, up to 23kgs for the flight). The staff told me they can assist and it would cost 25 euros each piece of baggage and asked me to send an email address for the payment link to be sent to. To get to this point took another 4 weeks because they were so slow to reply. They already had my email address! Again, wasting more time, I told them the email they had been using to correspond with me all that time is the email they can use to send the payment link. We were leaving Aug 26th for our trip and I sent an email Aug 15th, after not receiving the payment link. I requested it ASAP. They never sent it. At the airport check-in counter they told me I had to pay 50 euros for each piece of luggage. I showed them the email from the airline staff informing me of the 25 euros cost. They then told me I had to speak to Customer Service. Customer service totally disregarded the emails from the airline staff telling me the 25 euros cost (she wouldn't even look at them) and said the payment link was sent to GoToGate (a third party I used to book the flight) and there's nothing they will do for me. Horrible customer service. They were just passing the buck so they didn't have to provide any actual customer service.

### "They were appalling"
Not Verified |  Rude check in staff, slow check in, uncomfortable seats and unhelpful Cabin Crew. I will never fly with this terrible airline again. They were appalling!

### "won't ever use this airline again"
Not Verified |  I would definitely come back to the lovely island of Mykonos, but sure thing won't ever use this airline again. We've been charged for extra weight although they knew (and saw) it was about shopping items - only 8 kg for 2 adults. Paying for extra wasn't the issue, but to reach home with 4 broken items was the peak of the violation. So basically i paid extra weight and they broke my items.

### "by far the worst airline"
Not Verified |  This is by far the worst airline, they always lose luggage and they are always late. When we arrived to Crete, luggage didn’t make it until after 2 days and they told us to file a claim to redeem our money however they are not answering and it’s been 10 days. Then on our way back from Santorini to Lebanon, first the plane was delayed by one hour and we had to run to make it to the second flight to Lebanon and of course luggage didn’t make it to Lebanon until after one day however they lost one luggage and no one is able to locate it.

### "totally unprofessional service"
Constantly long and unjustified delays. This time about an hour and a half! And the worst part? They lie to passengers by pretending that “the aircraft has unfortunately arrived late from its previous destination”. They ignore however that, nowadays, almost every passenger can easily verify the accuracy of such silly excuses through apps like Flightradar24. On flight GQ225 of JUL26 2023, the aircraft (SX-NIV) was at ATH as early as 18:39 and was due to depart for KGS at 20:45. Barely a cold apology from the cockpit. Finally deplaned in ATH in total darkness (not a single light in the aircraft cabin) for obvious technical reasons. Unreliable and totally unprofessional service.

### "trying to reach them multiple times"
I have been flying with Sky Express for the last 3 years, and during the first 2 years, I was super satisfied with their service. However, the last 3 flights I had experienced delays on all three occasions without any prior notice or apologies. Nevertheless, my main disappointment stems from trying to reach them multiple times by phone and sending numerous emails regarding a booking cancellation, but until today, I haven't received any response.

### "No responsibility, no liability"
Let me start by first off saying, this airline should be put out of business! Me and my wife just spent 2 weeks in Greece for our honeymoon. We visited 3 Greek islands including Milos. We flew with Sky Express from Milos to Athens, and then from Athens to Zakynthos. The plane was an older, smaller dual prop plane. No real problem there for a 20 min flight. However, we were forced to check our carry on luggage as was most of the other people on this flight. When we arrived in Athens we were informed that everyone’s checked luggage had been left in Milos! Only 2 bags had been put on the plane. My wife got very lucky as hers was one of the bags that was on the plane. We were told in Athens the plane was too heavy so the baggage had to be left behind. No one told any of us on the flight about this issue when we boarded! One problem with that, the flight was only about half full! I literally could have put my bag in an empty seat! Upon complaining at the Skyserv desk for lost luggage, I was told this happens quite often and that my bag would be put on the next flight which arrived several hours later. We were staying the night in Athens at the airport hotel so it was easy for me to follow up with. Long story short, it did not arrive on the next flight, in fact, it was not put on the next 3 flights! We took out flight the next day to Zakynthos, and upon arrival I had to find a store and spend money to buy at least a bathing suit so I could enjoy the pool at our hotel. My bag didn’t show up in Zakynthos until the end of our second day there. All in all, I was 3 days without any of my things or clean clothes, on my honeymoon! We were supposed to receive a call, when my bag reached Athens so we could be told which flight it would be on to Zakynthos, big surprise, no call! Now a little bit about this company. While trying to reach somebody, anybody to find our where my lost luggage was, I did some research about SkyExpress Airline. Turns out this airline was started by an investment group owned by a wealthy Greek man. However, the only actual employees that work for SkyExpress are the pilots and the flight attendants. This wealthy Greek man is a very smart guess. When starting SkyExpress, he also started a company called Skyserv. Skyserv is the company that takes care of all of the ticketing services etc, for SkyExpress Airline. They are the ones that I had to deal with when my luggage was left in Milos. Now if you talk to them to complain about SkyExpress, the company line is “I’m sorry, we don’t work for SkyExpress, but here is a phone number you can call for assistance.” All of their paperwork has the line, “We take no responsibility or liability for any problems or issues with luggage.” So here’s the deal, if you call the aforementioned phone number for SkyExpress, its only for a reservationist, who tells you for any complaints, you have to send an email. I sent a complaint email that night, guess what, no response. I have a strong feeling that complaints go right in the deleted bin. So SkyServ will not take complaints because they don’t work for SkyExpress, and SkyExpress has no customer service, so basically if you have any problem with SkyExpress you’re basically screwed. Very clever business setup. No responsibility, no liability.

### "going downhill with delays and time changes"
I am writing this review because of the non trained staff of the airline on the gate and not the airplane. The sky express staff on the gate were non trained, causing massive delays and there had been people fainting. They were even forgetting who they were scanning and causing further delays. Every single passenger had been complaining. A total disgrace for the airline staff on the gates. Totally unprofessional. I had been travelling a lot with this airline, but they are going downhill with delays and time changes (other airlines change the times but it is always 10-15 difference). Never again.

### "they lost both of our bags"
They loaded all the baggage and then decided they were overweight. They offloaded randomly 30 bags without ever saying a word to the passengers. Those bags never made it on the plane. No concern for the fact that these people had connecting flights or we're on their way home and had two or three additional days that they would have no luggage because of their stupidity. Didn't even have the decency to announce that they were going to do it and give people a chance to fly a later flight with their luggage. We always carry our bags on because of stupidity like this but that's not possible on the ATR because the overheads are so small. First time I checked the bag in 10 years and they lost both of our bags.

### "happy with this airline"
Totally happy with this airline, which has developed remarkably over the years and offers routes that its competitors do not.

### "Staff were polite"
During e-ckeck-in I could change the assigned seat to first row without paying extra. Boarding was done with pax-bridge. The flight was almost full and we departed on time. Aircraft was new and clean. Staff were polite and they offer in flight service for the 45 minute flight.

### "zero respect to their customers"
Worst ever company. I travel every 2 weeks and I use this airline only because of the flight hours. 8/10 times has a delay and the worst is that they never inform passengers about the time of delay. They show zero respect to their customers.

### "untrustworthy, uncaring"
I feel compelled to share my recent experience with Sky Express on a flight booking from HER to LHR. This review serves as a cautionary tale and a sincere warning to anyone considering flying with this airline. I am utterly disappointed and frustrated with the level of service and the unexpected changes that disrupted my entire travel plans. I received an email notification regarding a modification to the arrival time of my flight, which I acknowledged without hesitation. However, little did I know that this was just the beginning of a nightmare. The subsequent change in arrival airports was kept hidden from me, resulting in a colossal mess and immense inconvenience. To salvage my travel arrangements, I had no choice but to secure an additional flight with Aegean Airlines from HER to LHR, burdening me with an unexpected expense of €324.29. It is beyond comprehension that I had to bear such costs due to Sky Express' utter lack of professionalism and failure to provide adequate information or seek consent for substantial modifications. The frustration and financial burden caused by this airline are simply inexcusable. I strongly urge anyone planning to fly with Sky Express to think twice before entrusting them with your travel arrangements. They have proven themselves to be untrustworthy, uncaring, and completely negligent in fulfilling their responsibilities to passengers. In light of my disastrous experience, I have decided to file a claim for a refund of the Sky Express ticket and reimbursement for the expenses incurred due to their incompetence. Sky Express has shown a complete disregard for customer satisfaction, fairness, and basic communication. Spare yourself the stress and financial burden by avoiding this airline at all costs.

### "never received an answer"
I tried to make a complaint and got our money back, never received an answer. On 6th of August, we travelled from Athens to Chania for our honeymoon. Arrived early at the airport, 2 hours before our flight. At the check-in desk, when we wanted to check in our luggages, the person behind the desk told us that because we were the last to check in, we were put on standby. We couldn't believe what we are hearing, because we bought these tickets so early with upgraded packages, sky lounge access, etc. This is a trip to our honeymoon, booked the seatings next to each other. I checked days before our flight but there was no availability to check in, not online, nowhere. Luckily, we managed to get on the flight, but it ruined the beginning of our honeymoon. I sat next to the stewardess, my husband far away from me.

### "150 euros for three small carry on"
They charged my 150 euros for three small carry on. I wasn’t charged for these three bags from Athens to Santorini but now as I am going back four days later, the agent charged me 150 euros. So I paid $250 for bags, 2 large bags which I didn’t mind and fully expected to pay but the additional 150 is a rip off. Will never fly this airline again.

### "Customer care far from being serious"
﻿Flight cancelled on 3/22 without any communication (we discovered it at the airport the day of the flight), asked refund as stated by European Regulation. No reply from them, further requests followed and they did not pay, though confirmed on 6/22 that the refund will be paid the day after. Customer care far from being serious, shame on them.

### "it is unacceptable that sports equipment has limitations"
Not Verified |  As a low cost airline it is good. But it is unacceptable that sports equipment has limitations. For a snowboard equipment the board should be only 110 meters. The average height of the board is 140-150, can someone explain this logic to me? Especially when they have flights to winter locations and you want to go and do winter sports.

### "not enough space in the lockers"
There was not enough space in the lockers over our seats for our luggage and the staff split our luggage (group of 7) in several lockers all over the aircraft. After our landing, we had to wait all passengers to get off the plane and take our luggage.

### "a lack of professionalism and respect toward their customers"
Not Verified |  Avoid at any cost! I had booked a flight to travel from LHR to Thessaloniki via Athens on the 19th of December and after some weeks they sent me an email that they had canceled the flight. They offered me a free reschedule and I rebooked one for the 17th. I also booked my tickets to get to LHR with National Express. A week from the flight date they send me another email telling me that the flight has been rescheduled once again, but it departs from Luton! One week prior to my flight and during Christmas time there is no way for me to get there either via train or coach. So, I either have to pay for a very expensive cab to get to Luton, which I have no idea how I can afford, or I will be stuck away from home for Christmas. It is a very disappointing experience and shows a lack of professionalism and respect toward their customers. I would not suggest traveling with them and to try and avoid them at any cost, as I have traveled with various airline companies for many years and it is the first time coming across such a problematic situation.

### "kept telling me they reimbursed me"
We arrived late to Athens because of a delay in Toronto, and rushed to get to the Sky Express gate for our next flight to Santorini. We arrived with 30 mins to spare and after consulting with her colleague, the attendant determined it was too late for us to board and we would need to buy new tickets for the next available flight. Later we were told via email that we needed to be there 20 mins early but we were 30 mins early! Either way, we purchased new tickets and were given contact info for Sky Express to receive a refund of our taxes due to the missed flight. After our trip ended, I contacted the airline and provided all of our info and was told I would be reimbursed within 30 days. Well 30 days passed, then 60, then 90, and I was following up regularly via email but NO responses from anyone. Finally I called the airline and was told they reimbursed me in August to a card ending in 6237 but my card ends in 7237 so there is a mistake and I did not receive my reimbursement. They kept telling me they processed it and there was nothing further they could do. I provided proof of my purchase using MY credit card, and screenshots of my credit card statement, and they still kept telling me they reimbursed me (but to a card that I don't own). Finally they sent me "proof" of reimbursement, which is totally laughable, because the "proof" showed that they reimbursed a MASTERCARD in my husband's name ending in 6237 (which is not his card, and he only has a Visa), meanwhile it was MY VISA that was used to purchase the tickets - so how can you reimburse someone else who did not make the original purchase? What sense does that make? and to a card that doesn't exist! This has fraud written all over it and I will not rest until they are caught. It isn't even about the money at this point.

### "total lack of customer support"
I made an error with the date on booking my flight. I contacted the airline immediately and they had unacceptable change fees and a charge for calling their customer service line. They do not answer comments on their customer support line and offer no support whatsoever. Frankly I would recommend you avoid this airline because of their total lack of customer support and empathy.

### "denied to embark, due to overbooking"
Very bad company. Three of us have been denied to embark, even with boarding passes in hand, due to overbooking. No proposal for another flight and lost of part of holidays. We are waiting for reimbursement and compensation since august.

### "ever choose this company again"
They changed our department time 3 days before departure and when I called to complain (because I had made arrangements for us to be picked up at the airport) they didn’t even said that they are sorry which is the least they could do! Of course they did not help us at all and they were very rude. After that incident we went at the airport we did our check in and all we went in the airplane and when we sat they told us that there was some kind of issue with the airport and that we would have to stay in the airplane for an hour and a half and then we would leave. (And have in mind that they changes our departure time 3 days prior) we were all very disappointed and very angry. They could at least tell us that there would be a delay and let us at the airport and not in the airplane doing nothing. I would never choose this company again it is not worth the money and the costumer service is absolutely terrible.

### "it’s about the principle"
Travelling from New York to Athens and from Athens to Chania I had an extra luggage that I knew I will be charged no problem. The girl charge me by mistake for 2 extra luggage it wasn’t enough time to go back for my refund because my plane was leaving, so I email the company. They said it’s not refundable. For what for their mistake it’s not fair. It’s not about the money it’s about the principle of the Situation.

### "customer service is non existent"
Worst experience ever. The policies of this airline are absurd and their actions make no sense. Get ready for delays and misunderstandings if booking with them. Fast lane, priority boarding etc is just a scam, it’s nonexistent literally they’re just stealing your money. In my flight ticket priority bag handling was also included, however my suitcase arrived belated and also broken. Their customer service is non existent as well, i would send them emails and messages which they never replied to. On instagram they would read my message and never reply as well.

### "charge me more for our bags"
My new fiancé and I arrived to an empty airport for our flight back home after a beautiful trip to Santorini. We walked up to be checked in by the available ticket agent who just looked at us in awe that we were even in Greece. She never called us over, so we took the initiative to walk up to her since she was the only ticket agent available. She never greeted us. She proceeded to charge me more for our bags even though my original purchase included our bags on our first flight to santorini with the SkyJoy package, which means nothing by the way because their is no priority class on these flights and people were able to move wherever they wanted to during the flight. She refused to give me a rundown of the reason we were being charged more. She refused to give me her name (which she forgot she wrote on my receipt). She printed tickets without a gate. She gave us no direction as to where to go.

### "No one was there to help us out"
They lost my luggage and I got my luggage after one month. They told me they will reimburse me but after I sent them my information, they ignore me and my emails. It's been 2 months since I am waiting for my reimbursement. When I lost my luggage, I called them and emailed them so many times. No one replied me. Because of this airline, my trip to Greece was ruined and because of this airline, I will never ever go to Greece. I never ever had such a bad experience with any airline. No one was there to help us out. Our flight was delayed too!

### "requested a refund for the cancelled flight"
We were scheduled for the flight to Zakynthos from Athens on flight GQ420 on July 12, 2022. Though we were able to check in (online) the night before and showed up 1-1/2 hours in advance of the scheduled 9:50 AM departure, we were told the flight had been cancelled. The service representative seemed a bit confused at first telling us it left that morning, then told us the flight had been canceled and that we were emailed and were not entitled to a refund. Ww ere never notified of the cancellation or any alternative options! We had reserved an Airbnb on Zakynthos so we had to get there that day. Therefore, we had to take a taxi to a bus terminal, take a 4 hour bus ride to the ferry, then a two hour ferry ride to the island! We respectfully requested a refund for the cancelled flight to help recover the cost of the alternative transportation. They never responded to our emails.

### "I paid 4 euro for priority luggage"
Not Verified |  The flight delay 30 min and any of the ground staff inform us. Also was overbooked that means some of the passengers flown on the next flight. I paid 4 euro for priority luggage at Kalymnos and was the last luggage that came. The cabin crew was very nice and friendly. There wasn't variety on the aircraft only a biscuit and water of coffee for 1 hour flight.

### "missed my connection on Sky Express"
Not Verified |  I missed my connection on Sky Express from Corfu to Athens on July 18 2022 because of the unprecedented melted tarmac at London Luton that date. We arrived at nearly 1 AM in Corfu. I was not able to secure a connected flight the next day, July 19 2022 to Athens, but finally was able to persuade the only agent at Corfu airport at that time of night, and had to pay again - even though I had a ticket for a flight which I had missed as noted above for a ticket to Athens the next morning July 19 2022. I had to spend the night in the airport, no accommodation or food or anything. My travel insurance was disregarded, I had no recompense whatsoever.

### "have not been refunded"
Expedia and Sky Express cancelled my flight from Athens to Chania on July 5th as I was trying to check in my luggage. I had to buy new tickets for the same flight that was cancelled and have not been refunded or had a decent explanation from either company. Instead, both blame the other. Yesterday I received an incomprehensible, unpunctuated, ungrammatical message from a Sky Express that did not apologise in any way nor attempt take any responsibility.

### "They lost my luggage"
They lost my luggage I flew with Sky Express in august 2022. A terrible mistake. Their customer service department is a mess. They lost my luggage. There is no phone number to contact and all the communication was done by email. They are slow in responding and never reply to all the questions you ask.

### "They lost my luggage"
I flew with Sky Express in early June 2022 which was proved to be a terrible mistake. Their customer service department is a mess. They lost my luggage and spend my entire holidays without it. There is no phone number to contact and all the communication was done by email. They are slow in responding and never reply to all the questions you ask. They just say what they want to say and that's it. After spending most of my holidays, they notified me that they could compensate 30.00 EUR per day. They did not even apologise for the inconvenience! Two months after, I still haven't received any compensation. Save yourselves and seek alternative airlines. T

### "no one had even bothered to contact me"
Though I had been allowed 23 kgs in my suitcase to arrive into Greece via Emirates, Sky Express only allowed 17 kgs to fly from Crete to Athens. We discovered later that the ticket counter rep had forgotten to put a tag on my suitcase, but she was alert enough to give us a 78 Euro bill to pay for the extra weight and a couple of fake passes to a "VIP lounge" that took us asking four different airport staff the location of, because no one seemed to know it existed, and which actually turned out to be nothing more than a hallway with a few chairs lined against the wall. Totally not worth the back and forth walk around the airport or the set of stairs we had to climb with our carry on bags. Supposedly the VIP pass allows people to board ahead of the line, but no one called out any different categories and everyone was allowed to rush out of the door at the same time and onto a bus that would drive us to the plane, where we would have to climb a set of stairs to board. Upon arriving in Athens, we discovered one of our suitcases didn't make it. Actually, we didn't even know if it made it or not. Maybe it was still in Crete, or maybe it made it to Athens and was forgotten outside behind the luggage carousel. No one could tell us anything, nor did they even try. The Sky Express counter rep was less than helpful and made it clear to us that she did not want to deal with the issue of lost luggage, despite that being her actual job behind that counter. Instead, she sent me all the way back to the carousel to wait for my suitcase even though I had told her the conveyor belt had stopped running, all the other passengers were gone and the sign above the carousel indicated that there were no more bags. She refused to fill out a lost claim for me and kept insisting that there were delays and that the luggage might "show up at some point" and sent me back to wait at the empty carousel four times. After three hours with no results and her refusing to help me, the rep finally filed a claim report for me and gave me a number to call. She promised someone would call me in a couple of days with news about my luggage, but I never received a call, email, text message or anything. In fact, the number on the report she told me to call turned out to be an inactive number. So, I had nothing but an empty promise and a fake phone number at my disposal to try to find my luggage. Nine days later, when I was leaving Greece, I arrived at Athens airport early to see if anyone had bothered to look for my suitcase. There were at least ten other people crowding around the same claim counter who also lost their luggage with Sky Express, and no one was getting anywhere with the counter rep. After a while, we were told to walk around the airport and look for our bags in the corners of the building. When that didn't yield results, we were finally escorted to the basement of the airport where hundreds of pieces of unclaimed luggage lay unclaimed and many untagged. It was there where I finally found my suitcase. Since my arrival to Athens from Crete nine days earlier, my suitcase had just been left there unclaimed and no one had even bothered to contact me to let me know that it was there. I suppose people who don't like to help customers should not have jobs in customer service.

### "I’d use this airline again"
We got this flight for a good price because we wanted to land in London in the day and most direct flights landed late at night. Our departing schedule time was changed, but the flight was booked eight months earlier so changes weren’t altogether surprising and we were emailed about them in advance. The flight to Athens was on time and the flight to Heathrow was also on time and landed early. Athens airport was fine for passing the time. The baggage arrangements for this airline are a little unusual with maximum weight of 15kg for checked bag, but with the “Sky Joy” fare various bits broken down by other airlines are included like carry on bags. No fussiness encountered about dimensions or weight on our journey. We made seat reservations at the time of booking and all were honoured, with option to change at check in online. Check in online was time consuming but got there in the end. All bags made the journey via Athens as did the baby buggy which we were able to use for the transfer at Athens. On board service included free coffee/juice and tiny biscuits with other fairly predictable stuff to buy. The seating featured headrests and decent legroom, making the experience more pleasant than Easyjet. All the staff we met were courteous. I have no complaints and am quite satisfied. I’d use this airline again without hesitation.

### "we actually lost the ticket money"
Not Verified |  The reasons we booked tickets for our wife and 8-month-old baby to fly from Zakynthos to Heraklion, Crete with a change of plane in Athens were 1) The itineraries. 2) The price - We went to check in since they wouldn't let us check in electronically with our wife and child, and they told us that for the baby they needed photo identification (1 week before they had flown again with another airline and they didn't ask for a photo of the baby), we didn't have a certificate with a photo and here the tragedy begins. My wife waited standing with the infant for 40 minutes for them to speak to the manager to see what they could do. All the others just passed by to check in and they gave up! After they gave up we asked them to either change our itinerary or give us our money back. A lady even threatened to call the police. Not only did they not apologize, but we actually lost the ticket money. We're not talking about phone service. I would suggest it really be your last choice.

### "could only refund us the taxes"
They refused to let us board because the size of our sports equipment bag was bigger than their specifications. We typically pay extra for an oversize/overweight, but not with them. After refusing to let us on, they refused to refund us although I had paid to have a flexible ticket, so they kept that money too. They said they could only refund us the taxes. Not holding my breath.

### "So much stress, so little customer service"
We went from Zakynthos to Athens on Aegean, then Athens to Naxos on Sky Express. We were told in Zakynthos by Aegean that we would need to get our tickets for Sky Express once we landed in Athens. We landed 2 hours before our Sky Express flight. We went up to a Sky Express counter and one of the ladies completely ignored us. We kept trying to talk to her and she just kept turning away. The other one said she couldn’t help us because we weren’t on her flight after we waited 20 minutes just to get her to acknowledge us. I told her I just needed to know where to get my boarding pass for my flight. She said I couldn’t get them until my gate opened. When my gate opened I was the 1st in line. The woman there was the rudest of all. She said I couldn’t check in 30 minutes before my flight. I explained everything from my whole morning and how I had tried to check in several times. She called someone twice and I had to explain to her several times as she reprimanded me that I tried to check in every chance I got. She was not kind or helpful in any way. She finally printed our boarding pass. It took her less than a minute to print them. That was after she spent 10 full minutes telling us she couldn’t and that we should have gone to any sky express counter earlier to check in. Even though I did that and couldn’t get anyone to help me. So much stress, so little customer service.

### "don’t recommend it at all"
Not Verified |  I booked a flight and went to the airport an hour before the flight. The gate opened 30 minutes before the flight for only 5 minutes. I lost the flight as the queue for the check in at skyexpress was huge (I’ve already waited 30 minutes at the queue). I asked for a manager to find a solution and there was no one at the airport representing sky express! I was forced to book another flight as it was the only solution and lost 75€. I’ll never again book a flight with sky express and I definitely don’t recommend it at all.

### "Beware - you're taking a great risk if you check bags"
Beware - you're taking a great risk if you check bags. Sky Express lost all four of our bags on our trip from Rome>Athens>Santorini. We finally received three of them upon returning home (several days later). To this day (22 days later) we are still missing one bag. Sky Express doesn't answer the phone, and they rarely respond to our emails. With the Montreal Convention, we are due some reimbursement and yet we've heard nothing regarding this.

### "must remove their earbuds"
Not Verified |  I flew this airline twice in June, once from Athens to Naxos and the second time two weeks later from Santorini to Athens. The first flight was delayed about 1 hour. There was little communication between airline gate staff and customers, but there was little stress and we finally took off. The second flight from Santorini to Athens was on time but before the flight, airline personnel harassed a young woman because they said her suitcase was too heavy. They made her take stuff out of her suitcase and stuff it into two daypacks- one hers and one owned by a family member. They they seemed to shrug and say the heck with it and she put everything back into the original suitcase. Watching this bizarre airline theatre was surreal. The entire scenario made no sense. This is the only airline I have flown where during take off and landing the flight attendant comes down the aisle and tells anyone listening to music that they must remove their earbuds.

### "simply no customer support"
Not Verified |  We arrived at Syros and one of our luggage did not arrive. We filed a report at the airport and we were given a phone number and an email of sky express to contact. I wrote 4 emails and made countless phone calls. Nobody replied. There is simply no customer support with this airline.

### "You are wasting your time, your money and your mental health"
Not Verified |  If you have to judge this airline for the aircrafts or the prices it is excellent. If you judge it by service and respect to customers - something just as important - it gets below zero. In short, if everything goes well on your flight and you do not need to communicate with them, you will think that they are a serious company. If something comes up and you need help that you can not get from their funny site, then you just lost. You are wasting your time, your money and your mental health. Tragic.

### "whole experience was wonderful"
This was my first flight with Sky Express. The whole experience was wonderful! The staff were friendly, the aircraft clean and tidy and all on time. Highly recommended.

### "Staff were simply rude"
Booked a return flight BRU-ATH. Away flight fluent: clear check-in procedure, calm flight, about 1/3 Seats occupied. Leg room and seat recline were limited. No inflight entertainment and food menu was limited. No WiFi. Return flight check-in procedure at ATH was below every standard: arrived 2+hours before departure, only for bag drop. 7 counters (3 bag drop, 3 check-in, 1 special assistance), only 3 actually in service for 12 departing flights. Late passengers were “awarded” with immediate check-in, we waited 90 mins and eventually also got called as our flight was set for departure. Staff were simply rude. Other people in the line missed their flight because of bad management at check in. Ground staff didn’t care.

### "Terrible service, rude arrogant staff"
Terrible service, rude arrogant staff. Stay away from this airline. They will do everything to annoy you. An airline that shows no interest at you apart from trying to make you purchase another ticket.

### "waiting for a refund from them since July"
I was pleased with our experience initially however I am now waiting for a refund from them since July! There were glitches on their website forcing me to book too many reservations and needing to cancel and they have not yet refunded me or sent any form of receipt. I call and email endlessly and hear back once a week with the same response to continue waiting. I would never recommend

### "worst company I have ever traveled"
Not Verified |  It's the worst company I have ever traveled my family and our dog. When we were flying to Chania it was an hour late and on the way back to Athens we were told not to take our little daughter's hood from the plane. When we picked it up with the suitcases it was broken. Consider afterwards that it became intentional.

### "I have never seen anything like it"
The organisation at Athens Airport was simply unbelievable inept. I have never seen anything like it. The airline was supposed to operate windows 53-61 but the queues were enormous due to insufficient staffing and poor management of the huge queues. We were nor the only ones who barely made our flight - some did not. We were in the queue for almost two hours having arrived to the airport 2hr 15min before the flight take-off. The crew on the plane were outstandingly good and deserve credit. Everything else requires improvement.

### "I do not recommend for anyone"
The worst airline ever! They change the flight time and do not even inform you! And then they charge you for a flight change if the new time does not suit you! I was on waiting line for two hours and they kept on hanging up on me! I do not recommend for anyone. Not worth it!

### "the flight attendants didn’t assure Covid safety on board"
Not Verified |  Horrible Customer Service! I booked extra luggage by accident and I wanted to cancel it. I called 5 times and was on hold for forever to get someone to speak too. I asked about a refund and they just said there is nothing they can do. Flight: old propeller plane, uncomfortable seats and the flight attendants didn’t assure Covid safety on board. They looked away to not see people take off their masks. And the flight was delayed also!

### "good old bus service"
Tried to web check one day before my flight but this was impossible, so I e mailed the company on this issue without ever receiving a reply... on the day of my flight, I succeeded and reserved seat No 3C... flight was delayed for half hour without any apology, and at check in they changed my seat from 3C to 13C at the captain's instructions as she explained (to balance the plane ! !). Plane was new, inflight service they only served water and orange drink. Absolutely no single reading material, arrived at Athens with delay (19.35) taxied for 15-20 minutes and parked away from anywhere, good old bus service as if we are still in the 50s, at boiling hot temps of 38 C into a boiling hot bus like sardines. Who cares about covid 19, pandemic etc, good old bus avoiding passenger jet steps. The flight was ok, but this airline should realise that passengers are not obliged to go through the good old process of steps and busses.

### "Konstantinos was so welcoming and helpful"
Not Verified |  My wife and I just visited Greece for the first time. When we arrived in Athens we chose Sky Express to travel to Santorini. Your gate agent Konstantinos was so welcoming and helpful. We did not know to have our bags weighed before checking in, and she was so helpful and kind in telling us the details. We immediately gave us a sense of how wonderful she and Sky Express are to visitors. Thank you so much for making us a fan of sky Express and especially Konstantinos! !

### "service was great and friendly"
Both planes were brand new A320neo and the flights were on time. Boarding were with buses at the 2 airports. Beware Thessaloniki airport does not have Business Lounges on operation (they are refurbishing them). Do not buy ticket with airport lounge access. Crew service was great and friendly. Stewardess were very meticulous. They offered candy before departure, water, orange juice, coffee with a biscuit.

### "The worst customer service"
I was excited about this new airline and had such a positive feedback after my first flight with them, but they broke my luggage and refused to reimburse me for this, stating it was a minor wear down. They are no different from any other low cost airline apparently. I was happy about the price of my ticket but they destroyed a much more expensive luggage. Never again. The worst customer service. My luggage cannot be used again

### "Followed the usual covid prevention measure"
Evening flight from Mykonos to Athens. Full flight. Slightly on the expensive side - was booked last minute. On time. We were offered 1 cold drink. Luggage included in the ticket price. Aircraft feels slower and noisier than others, however it's just a very short flight. Luggage retrieved in Athens without delay. Followed the usual covid prevention measures. Pretty good and uneventful flight.

### "have been trying to get our tickets refunded since June"
Not Verified |  We have been trying to get our tickets refunded since June, always told to call back or wait for a call. Now we’re told no refunds, only credit. Ok, but guess what? Same story! Wait for us to call you or call back in a week. Never ever hear from them and literally no progress. Anyone else in this situation? We can’t be the only ones.

### "A very pleasant experience"
A very pleasant experience. Efficient from boarding to luggage delivery. Welcoming ground and in-flight staff. The flight was on time and a good value. Within Greece distances aren't that long but the alternative would have been train-bus-ferry-bus and one day less vacation. So air hopping is a great alternative and sends your right where you want to be. Will definitely fly with them again.

### "it wasn’t worth it at all"
Terrible punctuality, both to and from Athens-Santorini flights were late by 1.5hr. Hurts when those are late night flights and you arrive at the hotel at around midnight due to the delay. Ground staff were clueless on both occasions. No apologies from the inflight staff. At EUR300, it wasn’t worth it at all. Aircraft are noisy. Luckily I was carrying a small rucksack, as those with standard cabin trollies struggled to fit those in overhead compartment. There is barely any role of inflight staff during those short flights.

### "I was impressed"
Heraklion to Athens with Sky Express Airlines. I was a bit worried reading other reviews, but my flight was on time, they give you access to lounge for free, they give snack on the plane, honestly it had been a long time since I had airline treatment like that. I was impressed and loved this airline.

### "break all 3 of our suitcases"
Naxos to Athens. Would not recommend. Managed to break all 3 of our suitcases, 2 of which were brand new. The lock on my case was broken off and it was evident someone had tried to go through it for valuables- luckily there weren’t any in the bag. When I tried to speak to staff about this they shrugged at me and walked away.

### "baggage had to be 15kg"
Not Verified |  Athens to Santorini. Terrible airline, disorganized check in took an hour, not advised that baggage had to be 15kg - we were 2-3kg over and charged  56 Euros. I have checked their website which says 5 euro per kg not 8 Euro. Sat on the tarmac for 1 hr in the heat, just as hot for the trip, poor aircon on the plane.

### "hopeless checkin process"
Athens to Naxos. Absolutely hopeless checkin process. It is out sourced to 3rd party who do 10+ other airlines. Result is hundreds of passengers trying to get thru 4 desks. If you are Greek & shout & push your way to the front you catch your flight maybe. Everyone else is left in the queue. Miss your flight, go buy another ticket for the next flight! Avoid this scam!

### "delay due to operational reasons"
Heraklion to Rhodes. Keep Away. Announced for 6:30 boarding time and finally we got a delay announce that due to "operational reasons" we will have a delay in further news after about an hour. When we first travelled to Kreta with this airline, our chairs were dirty.

### "terrible experience"
Kefalonia to Corfu. Absolutely terrible experience. The flight was delayed 2 hours, no information was given at all, the information boards were not updated, none of the flight tracker websites were updated with the delay. We had to just sit in the airport, hoping the flight wasn't cancelled. Such a joke. When the plane did arrive no explanation or apology was given. Worst customer service ever. The Greek aviation industry has ruined my impression of Greece.

### "I would recommend"
Not Verified |  Athens to Paros. We were a little worried catching this flight, after reading the reviews. We had a little issue with our carry on mini suitcase being too big and we ended up paying 45eu extra. I do warn you, square carry on bags will not fit in the over head lockers so best to organise them to get checked in before you reach the counter. Other than that, the bags arrived at the destination with no issues and the flight it self was on time and we didn’t have any issues boarding or during the flight. I would recommend.

### "good for a budget airline"
Athens to Kefalonia. Flight was a little late but the service was good for a budget airline, we purchased extra baggage which was a good price which came with the added bonus of a lounge pass at Athens airport a free drink and biscuit was also supplied during the one hour flight

### "Customer service was appalling"
Customer service was appalling at Athens Airport on arrival. Bags were not put on the airline in Naxos and no communication about this until we investigated further on arrival into Athens. Only told that it was a last minute decision and that they would be coming by ferry. Customer service woman at the counter seemed to think by us as the customer asking a question it was a personal attack on her. Given that she is the representative of the airline my request was only for her to explain what happened and the solution. She provided none, was rude and said that Sky Express accept no liability for the missing luggage. Aircraft was also late to depart and again staff seemed to be very good and “knowing nothing” and remaining vague.

### "Very bad customer service"
Cyprus to Chania via Athens. Very bad customer service. The staff seemed very frustrated when I asked what's going on with the flight and never got back to me. I had to learn what's going on from other customers. That will be the first and last time. If they don't like working here it's not customers fault. They're supposed to be there to help.

### "cancel the flight at 1am"
Athens to Mykonos. Our flight was delayed for 5 hours before we were able to board only to try to take off on a plane that the pilot had to land back down. They promised us a flight to Mykonos from Athens that night so we waited for seven hours before they decided to cancel the flight at 1am in the morning. They did not provide hotel accommodation nor compensation for the hotel we booked at Mykonos that we cannot get a refund on. We had to sleep in the airport waiting for the next flight at 5am to make to Mykonos to catch our flight back home. We booked with another airline because they didn’t have any flights til much later the next day. They promised us hotel, compensation for our loss n time but it was all lies. I emailed the company several times with the info they told us to contact them for the compensation and have not heard one single word back.

### "totally unacceptable in 2019"
Naxos to Athens with Sky Express Airlines. The worst airline I have ever flown! We have just arrived in Athens to be told the captain chose to not take any checked baggage at all on the flight! Yes - not one suitcase was carried apparently due to the aircraft being over weight. They off loaded 2 passengers (voluntarily) and then don't tell you your bags are not going to make it on the flight - you find that out when you arrive in Athens! So we have a connecting flight to Austria - but they will only send the bags to Vienna - not Salzburg which is our final destination. We think they will arrive - by ferry around 8pm tonight! So, we have to stay in Athens - at our cost - change flights for tomorrow. Apparently - this happens daily, totally unacceptable in 2019. Get bigger aircraft's that can handle passengers luggage requirements.

### "delay with no bags in sight"
Not Verified |  Do yourself a favor and do not book with this airline. Ever. I’ve been in Greece for 1 week and this airline has single handedly almost ruined my entire holiday. I am sitting at the airport an hour after my flight landed after a several hour delay with no bags in sight. It is also the middle of the night. I can’t even begin to express my disgust for this airline but if you would like a relaxing and peaceful holiday, do not book with them.

### "They cancelled our flight"
I flew with them twice on our trip to Greece. Once from Rhodes to Crete they cancelled my families flight (4) and rebooked it for 3 hours later. My son booked this flight and when we called to complain they said had sent an email 2 weeks before. No email was sent. My husband and I had also already booked them from Santorini to Athens and they did the same thing. They cancelled our flight never informed us. I checked this time that's the only way I knew our flight time was changed until later since this time I didn't trust them. We called them and all they said was they sent the email. Both times they lied and were very unapologetic.

### "Never using it again!"
Not Verified |  
Flew Athens to Mykonos with Sky Express Airlines. Delayed flight 3 times. Our flight was scheduled for 11:20 am. We were informed that the flight was delayed at 10:30 am to 12:40 pm. At 12:40 pm we were informed that the flight was delayed to 13:45 pm. We began to board on a bus at 13:30 pm. As we were boarding a bus they stopped letting people in. We waited one more hour standing on the bus. When we were taken to the plane we waited more than one and half hours. Awful airline. Never using it again!

### "definitely flying again"
Naxos to Athens. Loved the ease that our luggage was checked weighed and checked in without any hassles. It is a small airport but the staff knew what they were doing as well as assisting passengers who were not sure of what to do. A very big thank you and I will definitely flying with you again next summer.

### "not refunding the money"
Athens to Kefalonia. This airline was contacted when it was explained to them that a mistake had been made on the ticket. It was not a change of mind situations. They charged €35 for a changed of mind fee. An email was sent 3 times of explaining that it was not a change of mind and the money should be refunded. There was no reply from any of the 3 emails. This is so wrong and a disgraced of the behaviour by avoiding the true issue of not refunding the money.

### "very bad experience in general"
Naxos Island to Athens. Delayed (as usual) for about one hour without any notification or information provided by the ground staff. No apology on board. Distant and unfriendly flight attendant. Old equipment with dilapidated interior. No web check-in available. Very bad experience in general. Neither a professional service nor a reliable airline, with not necessarily reasonable tariffs.

### "Small propeller planes"
Siteia to Alexandroupoulis. Small propeller planes with lot of noise during the flight. The planes seem old and some seats can be in bad condition. The staff is polite, they offer a drink, cookie, caramel and a towel during the flight. Usually on time, better value for money than other regional airlines.

### "Crew were great and friendly"
Flew Athens to Chios. Much cheaper than Olympic Airways and you have access to SkyServ Lounge at Athens Airport, also free 13 kg Luggage and 3 kg handbag. There is not much food selection at the lounge but is good to be away from the crowds. Both flights on ATR42 and were on time. Crew were great and friendly. They offer coffee and a small cookie on a 50 minute flight. They do not have inflight magazines but they offer FreePress magazine.

### "totally satisfied with the flights"
I flew round trip from Athens to Kalymnos with Sky Express Airlines. I was totally satisfied with the flights. Only around 10 minutes delay for both flights. Check in luggage was included in the fare. Also at Athens airport after the check in, I was offered a free coffee / refreshment at the lounge bar and I was allowed to use the fast lane for the security check.

### "will never use it again"
Santorini to Athens. My mom and I had a flight booked for 3:15pm. We had a second flight leaving Athens at 6:45pm. The Sky Express flight was delayed more than 4 hours in Santorni because of the day befores wind storm. They did not tell us in enough time to get to Athens via ferry or another airline. They barely gave any information. There were tons of other flights going out and my mom and I could have booked another but they kept saying we were leaving. Then by the time we left, with no food, my mom boarded with some chips. The flight attendant said she had to put them away and she said she hadn't eaten in more than four hours. The flight attendant snapped back and said she hadn't eaten in 5 hours. She was extremely rude to my mom and this was on Mothers Day. We missed out flight in Athens and had to pay for a whole new flight. No help was given and no money back. Our new flight was leaving the next day so we had to pay for an overnight in a hotel, the taxi there and back to the airport and we didn't get our money back from the hotel in Bucharest. This airline cost us over $500. And no apology was given. We will never use it again!

### "would recommend this airline"
My friend and I flew round trip from Athens to Zakynthos, Greece with Sky Express Airlines. I was a bit apprehensive because I get nervous when taking smaller planes (also a propeller plane). Needless to say I had nothing to worry about. These two flights ended up being the most smooth of all our 6 flights in 12 days. There is only one flight attendant on board but both ways they were very friendly! They even give you candy, cookies and beverages, despite the fact that the flights were in total 40 mins take off to landing. I would recommend this airline for any travel within Greece itself. Our first flight was delayed about 30 minutes, but considering the flight time was estimated at 1 hour and ended up only being 40 mins, it didn't make much difference in the end. They also included a free 15kg checked bag at no extra charge, which is more then any other budget airline. Gooder value for you money.

### Sky Express Airlines customer review
Limnos-Lesvos on a BAe Jetstream. A quick and friendly check-in. No seats were allocated for this short flight. We were bussed the 50 metres to the plane which took about a minute across an empty tarmac. The seats were comfortable enough given the length of the flight though the aircraft interior looked quite worn. The single crew member served a boiled sweet and a cold drink. The flight operated on schedule.
