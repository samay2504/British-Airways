### "Good European airline"
Good European airline. Cabin was very clean and quiet. Crew were very baby-friendly. Food was disappointing. Drinks were fine. Check in was smooth and so boarding and disembarking.

### "Crew was friendly"
Boarding by bus, plane was clean and on time departure. I was on row 20 and legroom was tight. Crew was friendly offered candy on boarding and midflight sandwiches with drinks. Free wifi is offered but most of the time was not operating (maybe due flyhing over sea)

### "customer service is shocking"
Not Verified |  Two adults and a two year old booked to fly out to see relatives in Greece. Aegean run the second leg of a Lufthansa route. Came to check in and Aegean have reallocated our seats from our pre-booked, pre-paid row at the front to the back of the plane with no notification - we only discovered the issue the day before travelling. Despite repeated attempts to resolve the issue by us over the phone and online and by Expedia (Aegean hung up on the supervisor) Aegean have failed to provide any justification or apology. Lufthansa, who run the route, are similarly disinterested - they have no say or control it seems. All we have been told is that the change is due to operational reasons. Unfortunately this is not the first time they have had an issue with us travelling with our child - during our last flight they took away the seat we had booked for him. Oh, and no one knows where the refund for the money we paid to book at the front of the plane will come from! Aegean’s customer service is shocking. If they don’t want to discuss the issue they will simply hang up. There’s no point complaining, they will simply ignore any communication and not reply. We’ll not be using them again - once can be forgiven, twice is inexcusable.

### "did not leave on time"
Flight did not leave on time. There is not enough space to place cabin bag and they are picked up at entrance. Crew makes no effort to place luggage.

### "So many smiles and excellent service"
You are all so sweet and smiling! I travel frequently, and for the first time in my life, I saw so many smiles and excellent service! Well done! Keep it up! | Είστε όλοι γλυκύτατη και χαμογελαστοί! Ταξιδεύω συχνά και πρώτη φορά στη ζωή μου είδα χαμόγελα πολλά και εξυπηρέτηση! Μπράβο σας! Συνεχίστε έτσι!

### "have to pay a name change fee"
I made a single letter spelling mistake on my name as I booked a ticket on my phone. Aegean charged me a name change fee to correct the letter I spelled wrong on my name. I mistyped a letter. They spoke to a supervisor who insisted I have to pay a name change fee to correct that letter on my name, as per policy. Aegean want to make money off my little spelling error.

### "being so friendly and helpful"
Amazing experience! I want to thank you all of the flight attendants for being so friendly and helpful. I am afraid of airplanes and they helped me calm down and relax. Special thanks to Maria for being there whenever I need her. The best flight attendant!! Her customer service was super. She was there to help and make me feel comfortable!

### "Good overall experience"
Good overall experience, albeit a steep price to pay for either economy or business. I had the chance to fly business on this trip and was pleasantly surprised by the food assortments and wine, but rather disappointed by the seating and overall feeling of lesser luxury. It is a shame that the seats offer a lesser premium feel and lesser comfort and appearance, especially for business class, as they operate some beautiful new A320neo aircraft. Wi-Fi on board has never worked in my case, but this could be an isolated issue. Business class does not offer many inflight entertainment options apart from magazines but as a short haul airline this has never been the largest inconvenience. The cabin crew is always a delight, and boarding happens almost always at a gate with minimal delays (although this is not always on the airline). I have definitely flown a lot worse, but also have flown better. My score is for my most recent business class trip, and I note that it would be slightly lower if I were rating for my experience in economy class. Improved seating, cabin appearence and economy offerings would make my next review score higher.

### “Hope not to use their services in the future”
I had booked my ticket and probably because of the touch screen because of the automatic writing an error occurred and my surname was not correct. All the other details were done correctly. So when yesterday I went to the airport the person at the bag drop told me that I had to contact with the customer service of the airline company to do the necessary because of the mistake with my surname. I called them and unfortunately for my surprise the responsible of the company informed me that I had to pay AGAIN a NEW TICKET at the price of 73,80€ just to rewrite correct my surname meanwhile my name, birthday, visa number and all the other were correct. It was really funny that at the same flight an employee of the company offered 250€ cash, one free ticket and a ticket to fly from Rhodes to Athens with the flight of 20:15 to a girl just because it had happened a "problem" with another customer of their company who flew to Athens. I wonder if there is in Europe somebody to explain to us the customers of Aegean Airlines why the company asked me to pay twice the price of my ticket just because of an error that happened probably not only to me but maybe also had happened to others. The policy of this company is at least unreasonable with the only motive how to steal money from their customers. Imagine that I have a member card of this company. The way they punish a mistake is at least ridiculous. Probably they think that we leave in the '80s where there was not the information we can all of us have. Hope not to use their services in the future just because of the way they think they can treat to their card members.

### “this was my worst experience”
The overall experience was terrible, first we had about 20 min delay in boarding the plane, then there was a delay in the airport shuttle as well which is supposed to take us to the gates, never mind this was a transit flight which left us no time to reach the next gate and they didn't even bother to send an usher to let us know what to do, the airport personnel told us to go to their Kiosk and their employee had little client relations experience, thought that booking a hotel and flight the next day would some how miraculously help us reach our obligations in time and was rude in general with little regard to people's feelings. And when we asked for compensation for the delay they regarded it bad weather although the delay was obviously logistical. Also the plane got crowded, the seats are too close, they might cancel tickets and rebook them away from each other, and you easily catch a flu from how close the seats are together. Other airlines were much much better, this was my worst experience.

### "Friendly professional staff"
Upon arrival in Rhodes, a suitcase was delayed. Indicated at the counter. The handling was done very well. We arrived on the next flight and were taken directly to our address. Super! The entire flight also went great. Friendly professional staff. Flying with Aegean is a relief. Bij aankomst op Rhodos was er een koffer vertraagd. Bij de balie aangegeven. De afhandeling is super gedaan. Met de volgende vlucht meegekomen en direct naar ons adres gebracht. Super! Ook de gehele vlucht was super verlopen. Vriendelijk professioneel personeel. Vliegen met Aegean is een verademing.

### “Aircrafts are old and dirt”
Not Verified | This is in reality a low cost airline (see Ryanair), only with high prices. Prepare for the shortest pitch you have experienced (especially if you're seated in any row behind the first emergency exit. Aircrafts are old and dirty, food (which is a actually a snack) is inedible (in economy). Wifi is almost always not working. Customer support is non existent. You cannot cancel your ticket online(!!). You have to call their support center and get a 23 euro cancellation fee. Avoid at all costs.

### "No compensation was offered"
I travel for a business trip to Rome. My luggage never came and I received my luggage back in the initial departing airport when i returned back. I had to spent a significant amount of money in order to buy the necessary clothes and accessories in order to be able to attend to the planned business professional obligations, with only a few hours available in an unknown market. The employee of the airline reassured me through a telephone call that the company will cover the expenses. When I applied for compensation, the company offered me the amount of €240, which was significantly smaller compared to the basic expenses, and I did not accept. No compensation was offered for the suffering of course.

### "do not recommend"
For a 40 minutes flight from Athens to Santorini, Aegean Airlines charges €40 per check-in luggage that is standard carry-on luggage size in most of all the other Star Alliance airlines, these are the same carry-on luggages our family traveled with on the same Aegean airlines from Paris to Athens on the same day. The head ground crew in Athens ran over to stop our family from boarding, pulled us aside, not allowing us board until we pay the total €80 for 2 pieces. Why did the Aegean crew in Paris allow us to board and not the Aegean crew in Athens. I showed I was UA Gold 2million flyer but we’re still embarrassed by the Aegean Athens ground crew. I found out after I boarded my check in luggages definitely fit in the overhead compartment even this was a smaller plane than the one I transferred from Paris. I do not recommend anyone flying Aegean Airlines. I will not.

### "upgrade to business hardly ever comes"
I’m a frequent traveller for the last 20 years. I’ve flown Aegean Airlines more than 50 times. They offered a very good service but during the last 3-4 years, they’re growing fast and customer service is not their priority anymore. My views based on the last 4 flights with Aegean during the summer seasons they were delayed (more than 60 min), with my checked luggage lost twice. To be avoided during Summer! Their boarding is the slowest and most unorganised allowing passengers with several bags per person, not entering all in the plane, blocking the corridor and sending half the bags out to be picked up at the airport’s belt. Forr Gold/frequent travellers of Aegean, we are entitled to 4 vouchers/year for business upgrades. Most of the times we’re sent to the waiting list and the upgrade to business hardly ever comes.

### “a really pleasant experience”
Overall a really pleasant experience; on time, cheerful staff, spotless cabin and a tasteful snack with a chocolate bar and a drink (incl. alcoholic beverages) served mid flight - a nice blast from the past. My only complaints are i) bus shuttle to terminal at Makedonia airport (although it was quite efficient) and ii) seat comfort (a little cramped). I would certainly fly Aegean more often, since it's clearly one of the top airlines in Europe. But competitors usually offer better fares.

### "Very disappointing"
We upgraded to business class thinking we would have better service but that wasn't the case. At the check in counter the agent took forever to check us in., no smile no gate information, just worked on her computer checked in our bags and gave us our boarding passes. The boarding process was chaos they didn't chk ID. Boarding the plane the flight attendant was on her phone didnt greet us. Once boarding was complete she  handed us a bag with bottle of water and sandwich. Very disappointing.

### “claims to be pet-friendly”
While my journey with Aegean Airlines started pleasantly, the arrival experience at Athens Eleftherios Venizelos was highly disappointing, especially regarding handling my pets. The check-in crew at London Heathrow was friendly and helpful, but this positive experience was overshadowed by what happened upon arrival in Athens. Aegean Airlines promotes itself as pet-friendly, but my experience showed otherwise. Traveling alone with three small dogs in separate kennels, I expected clear guidance or assistance from the airline, especially since they knew I was a single passenger. Unfortunately, no instructions were given, and no representatives offered help. After a delayed luggage pickup, I was left to search for where my dogs might be. After asking an airport cleaner for help (because no one else was around, like airport representatives), I eventually located my dogs’ crates abandoned on the floor in a different section of the baggage area—an upsetting and unacceptable situation. To make matters worse, an airport staff member nearby was on her phone and didn’t care to assist or greet me. There was also no help handling the kennels on a trolley, making it incredibly difficult for pets to navigate and find transport out of the airport. For an airline that claims to be pet-friendly, this experience was far from it—terrible customer service from Aegean Airlines on the ground in Athens. I hope Aegean Airlines seriously reconsiders how it supports passengers traveling with their beloved pets to ensure smoother and safer experiences in the future.

### “Great value for money!”
Upgraded to business with Plusgrade. Great value for money! Still one of the very few full service carriers with a classic service offering a welcome dring before departure and a full (hot) meal with option to choose from for the main menu. It's the small details that count with Aegean such as the cloth serviette (haven't seen this for quite some time on any medium haul with any airline) or the possibility to order a tasty Cappucino or Espresso. Additionally, typically new aircraft are used between FRA/MUC and Athens (A 320 neo/ A 321 neo) which adds to the overall excellent experience. Unfortunately, I had a short layover in Athens on my way to Paros and as the flight from Frankfurt was slightly delayed, I couldn't catch my flight to Paros. Outstanding incident handling by Aegean Airlines - they rebooked me on the first available flight next morning and sent me an SMS with a reservation confirmation at Athens Sofitel Airport hotel where complementary dinner and breakfast was offered. I had many incidents with another European Airline this year but never had such a smooth incident handling process like this. Many thanks, Aegean - you continue to be my first choice on the way to Greece!

### "75 euro for 1 10 kg bag round trip"
From the bag check showing up 45 min late (for the Light Fare option, an 8kg carry on limit you have to check nearly any carry on bag, total 75 euro for 1 10 kg bag round trip) to the gate change across the airport with no notice at the gate, text, email, or web, we had to run from A36 to the other end of FCO airport at A73. Arrived 3h early and nearly missed my flight. Never again.

### “A constant bad experience”
Not Verified | A constant bad experience at every flight. Delays of more than an hour are now extremely common, seats are cramped, cabin service is minimal. The flight crew are friendly and polite.

### “lack of communication has been appalling”
Terrible Experience with Aegean Airlines – Lost and Damaged Bags, No Support. During a transit flight, Aegean Airlines lost my bag, and despite my repeated efforts to follow up, their customer service has stopped replying to my emails being completely careless. After two months, they still haven’t found my bag and have escaped from compensating me for the loss! To add insult to injury, they even blocked my access to their tracking page, leaving me completely in the dark! Their lack of communication, care, and basic customer service has been appalling. Worst airline experience ever! If you value your belongings and peace of mind, I strongly recommend avoiding Aegean Airlines. Save yourself the suffering!

### "the crew was very friendly"
Besides the crew which was very friendly I couldn't recognise anything of the Aegean Airlines I knew a decade ago when I used to fly Aegean frequently. I ordered a vegetarian meal which turned out to be a nasty sandwich that was inedible and a low quality chocolate granola bar. I paid extra to sit in the emergency exit but the seat was not particularly comfortable. I recommend the airline only because it took off and arrived on time.

### "the worst airline experience"
Aegean Airlines left us stranded and sleeping on the airport floor! This was hands down the worst airline experience of my life. We were in Venice, Italy, waiting to fly to Beirut via Athens, and no one at the counter bothered to tell us that our connecting flight from Athens to Beirut had been cancelled. We only found out once we were already on the plane, after we asked a flight attendant, who casually informed us. She reassured us that the customer help desk in Athens would take care of everything. They did nothing. In Athens, we were told it wasn't their problem, and we were left to fend for ourselves with no solution, no assistance, and no care. We were stranded in the airport, with nowhere to go, and ended up sleeping on the floor. Aegean Airlines abandoned us. To make matters worse, we’ve been sending emails, and they are completely ignoring us.

### "give up on short connections"
Aegean was a very good company in recent years. It is still so during the low season (winter) where flights are on time and in the event of problems (especially weather) the support is efficient. On the other hand, their new planes are much less comfortable than the old ones with greatly reduced legroom. This negatively changes the flying experience compared to previous years. Furthermore, traveling with them in summer has become a real hell,flights are very often late (especially evening ones) with compromised connections. And no assistance, you have to figure out how to find a hotel not to mention that postponements are often automatic (without any choice possible because the suitcases are automatically sent on the flight chosen by the company) so arrival at 11:30 p.m. next flight canceled and scheduled for 4:35 a.m. No possibility of collecting the suitcases and therefore taking a later flight to rest. This is the last time I travel with them in summer. They should give up on short connections which never work... a very good company in winter on the other hand. Aegean était une très bonne compagnie ces dernières années. Elle l'est encore lors de la basse saison (hiver) où les vols sont à l'heure et en cas de problèmes (notamment meteo) la prise en charge est efficace. Par contre leurs nouveaux avions sont bien moins confortables que les anciens avec des espaces pour les jambes fortement réduits. Cela change négativement l'expérience de vol par rapport aux années précédentes. Par ailleurs voyager avec eux en été est devenu un véritable enfer... les vols sont très souvent en retard (surtout ceux du soir) avec des correspondances compromises. Et aucune assistance c'est débrouillez vous pour trouver un hôtel ... sans comptez que les reports sont souvent automatiques (sans choix possible parce que les valises sont automatiquement envoyés sur le vol choisi par la compagnie...) ainsi arrivée à 23h30 vol suivant annulé et prévu à 4.35. Pas possible de récupérer les valises et donc de prendre un vol plus tard pour se reposer... nuit blanche à l'aéroport. C'est la dernière fois que je voyage avec eux en été... chaque année c'est de pire en pire. Ils devraient renoncer à envisager des correspondances courtes qui ne fonctionnent jamais... une très bonne compagnie en hiver en revanche.

### “professional and polite staff”
Pleasant and uneventful trip at a very low cost, would definitely recommend and fly again. The staff were very polite and helpful. From the people at the Aegean's lounge in Athens, to the people in the gates and the flight crew, they were happy to help with a smile on their faces. When I got to Athens airport and passed the security check I realized that I had booked economy light class, which, as the websites states, you can only carry either a hand luggage OR a personal item, but I was carrying both. I tried searching for an Aegean help desk at the terminal I was in but I couldn't find one, so I asked the staff at the lounge for directions. They told me the help desk is accessible only before the security check and asked me what the problem was to figure out if they could help. They could have just said it's not our job to help you since we are at a lounge, but they did either way. I explained the issue with the luggage and they told me I could call the Aegean's call center since they weren't informed. Even though it was 4am they picked up immediately and informed me that the rules about economy light have changed since May 2024 and that I could carry both a hand luggage and a personal item, they just didn't update the rules in their website yet. During flight they give economy class a sandwich (there's also a vegan option), cookies and a drink. There is also a website which can be visited during flight to see the location of the plane. The WiFi, unfortunately, didn't work for the majority of the duration of the flight. The only negative about this airline is the booking website. It's a bit laggy, slow, confusing and as it turns out, not regularly updated, in contrast to the mobile application which is very fast, informing and easy to use. Either way it was a pleasant experience and it's good to know you can count on professional and polite staff when in doubt, who treat you with respect regardless your class type.

### "taking your carry on bag"
In every flight they have delays and lack of space, taking your carry on bag. However every time I need to estimate an approximate delay of 30 min to one hour (to 2 hours many times, specially during summer) plus the time to wait to collect my carryon bag that will have been checked. The staff is ok but the policies and regulations are getting worse. If they want to behave as a high cost airline, they need to start providing the relevant services to their passengers.

### “crew was very nice”
I bought an upgrade for the 3h flight from Brussels to Thessaloniki. The crew was very nice and well groomed, the meal, despite my choice not being available, was tasty. To drink I had white wine, sparkling wine and an espresso. All good. The seat had plenty of legroom. The seat and its surroundings were clean. The boarding at the gate was a little bit chaotic because people were standing where they shouldnt when it wasnt their turn to board and didnt listen to the gate agents instructions. There was a slight delay to ATC restrictions.

### “young, enthusiastic and friendly crew”
Not Verified |  Geneva to Yerevan via Athens. Geneva to Athens on A320neo aircraft: young, enthusiastic and friendly crew. WiFi available, and worked perfectly throughout. No IFE. Hot snack served (a full hot meal used to be served on this route), full round of drinks. Landed ahead of time. Athens to Yerevan on A320neo aircraft. Crew young, well-groomed but not very friendly, looked like they were not happy to be there. WiFi available but not working. No IFE. Hot snack served, full round of drinks. On both flights, planes could have been cleaner (e.g. crumbs on the floor) - Aegean shall improve on this matter and maybe extend their aircraft turnaround. Seats on their A320/1neo fleet are quite comfortable, though the legroom is not the best. Aegean Extra-Schengen Business / Star Alliance Gold lounge still quite WOW, one of the best in Europe: food selection is impressive (love the fact they are serving & promoting Greek products only), the lounge itself is very big and it never got crowded during the almost 9 hours I spent there. At the same time, I believe lounge maintenance should be improved (e.g. one of the toilets out of order, a couple of seats broken). Overall, still the best in Europe after Turkish Airlines.

### "Airport staff is very careless"
The flight from Larnaca was delayed 1 hour. On arrival to Athens cabin crew gave false information that transiting passengers will be assist at the airport. On transit desk staff said that I have to go through passport control go out from zone and go to security check again to reach the gate. How passengers can do it in 25 min? Airport is busy during summer, nobody help. I've never run such fast in my life, because I don't want to miss my flight. When I ask if my luggage is reloaded, the girl at the gate said that she has no information in very unpolite way. I would never again book Aegean Airlines if I need to do transit. Airport staff is very careless and not polite to me.

### "staff service was flawless"
Not Verified |   Ground service was mostly good with minor issues, cabin staff service was flawless, Seat comfort is terrible and cramped, there was no entertainment.

### “One of the worst business flights”
One of the worst business flights ever. I had heard good things about Aegean. The cabin crew were very warm and pleasant and that was it, old tired plane, old tired seat, no power outlet. Food even worse than some economy class flights, tasteless chicken, over-salted mash. No menus, no proper glasses for drinks just tiny thimbles and whilst ground services not Aegean fault, bags took 45 mins. Never again.

### “Clean modern plane”
Boarding a little late and baggage policy can be confusing. Clean modern plane, nice crew, food and a wine (free) were fine. Nice to see a full service european airline.

### “amazing flights with Aegean”
Once more, amazing flights with Aegean. Used their business class service from Brussels to Athens and back. Airport experience both ways, exemplary, with prompt baggage drop and very polite staff. Fast track for security highly appreciated and worked fine at both airports. Lounge facilities both in Brussels and Athens were very satisfactory despite being busy due to the rush hour. I must say that the food at the Athens lounge, is really good. During flight on their brand new A321neo aircraft, the crew were once more, the highlight. Attentive, smiling, constantly looking after their guests and smartly groomed in their new uniforms. Wifi speed was superb that allowed us to enjoy streaming services on our own devices. Once on the ground in both Athens and Brussels the baggage was delivered fast and I was happy to see that they honor the priority baggage delivery. Aegean remains one of the top airlines in Europe throughout the years with its teams taking pride representing the brand. They obviously do something right.

### "Most disappointing experience"
Most disappointing experience. They sell seats for large luggage in the cabin that should be placed in the hold; this way, those with small cabin bags are forced to put them under the front seat and sit uncomfortably. The crew was arrogant to me. My last trip with this company.

### "otherwise good experience"
Airline doesn't take responsibility for poor baggage handling that resulted in missing item from the inside of the bag. Offered free check in service for my hand carry luggage but did not explain in the beginning their policy of not assuming such liability. At the airport, I was directed to a phone number, and then to the online contact form. Customer service via online contact form is lip service, unsystematic and insinuating. The otherwise good experience could have differentiated them from the other airline, but they clearly failed when problems occur.

### "Aegean doesn't want to refund"
When booking we had two choices, the cheapest one to go from RHO-ATH-BCN but arrive there at 01:00 am where there are no buses for our end destination (Costa Brava) or the more expensive one to go from RHO-ATH-SKG-BCN but arrive there at 17:00. So we took the second option as we were going there for a festival and we did not want to miss any of the events as they were starting on the 16th of May and also to take a bus from the airport of Barcelona to Costa Brava instead of a taxi that would cost a fortune. Then, due to about two hours of delay at the flight from ATH-SKG we asked if we are going to miss our transit flight from SKG to BCN, and if so to let us not travel to Thessaloniki and take the later flight from Athens. They told us that they will wait for us as it is a transit flight. We arrived there 5 minutes after the flight was scheduled, and of course they didn't wait for us, and they changed our tickets for the next day via Munich. We demanded that they change them back to go via Athens and then again Barcelona, which after 2-3 hours of waiting time and many food costs at the airport, they did. So we arrived at Barcelona at 01:00 after midnight and our only means of transport was a taxi, which costed us 170€, and of course we missed 1 day out of 4 of the festival. Of course Aegean doesn't want to refund any of these costs. M On our way back they lost our baggage. 24 hours later we received one back, but the second we are still waiting (3 days later). And the worst part is that noone actually informs us on anything, they don't know where the bag is, they don't know if they found it, if we are taking it back or anything.

### "very impressed with Aegean"
Recently flew Lisbon to Athens return as well as a few domestic segments in Greece (Thessaloniki-Athens, and a couple of islands) and I was very impressed with Aegean. Planes were impeccably clean, flights were on-time and staff both in-flight and ground crews were very pleasant, and courteous. Hot meals and drinks were served on the LIS-ATH-LIS segments and, even on the short domestic hops, a bottle of water and a small snack were served. The only down side was that checked luggage took a long time to deliver. Legroom was a bit tight on the outbound A320 but felt more generous on the return A321neo. Probably one of my best experiences flying in Europe. I'd definitely fly them again.

### "take my carry on when boarding"
Not Verified |   Legroom is very small and worse than low cost carriers. They take my carry on when boarding (at no extra cost) due to the flight being full they say, but delays me when I arrive at my destination. Food is below average and has been getting worst. Too expensive for what they offer.

### “Very attending service”
We boarded by air-bridge to the aircraft, first families, then business class and members finally economy by zones. Crew was very friendly and attending. Business class covers the 3 frond rows, same seats as economy 3x3 but blocked the middle seat. Legroom is perfect. When boarding completed we were served welcomed drink (water, juice, sparkling wine) and the Menu. After physical presentation of safe rules, we were offered warm towel. After departure the purser asked the passengers of their preference of lunch from the Menu. During the flight you can use free WiFi for Gold and Silver members and in Business. Food and wine was presented and were of excellent quality and tasty. Attendant refilled class of wine. Removing the disk with the main course, they offer desert with coffee. Finally they present you mastiha drink with chocolate boxes. We had Very attending service. We arrived on time and special bus transfer Business class passengers to the terminal.

### "Wi-Fi not working"
Wi-Fi not working in Business Class that was advertised as free. After landing the luggage with priority came last and not first and they lost one of my luggage. Even I had contacted them still they cannot find even they send an urgent signal immediately to send it with the first available flight that was next day at 6:30. The call center for Gold and Business class passengers has the same answer to all the questions, which is "we are only for reservations, please send email to customer care

### “Vile customer service”
Worst airline in Europe. Vile customer service. Desperate to extract every last euro from your wallet. A friend who works there says staff morale is very low and they will likely file for bankruptcy soon. Avoid at all costs!

### "still have not issued us our refunds"
Not Verified |   We had a trip planned for last July and cancelled our flight well in advance - 1 month - and they promised us refunds for all three tickets totaling $950. It is now 9 months later and they still have not issued us our refunds. They sent forms to fill out with bank account info, we filled them out, then they sent the same forms again - we filled them out again. Then they said they haven't received the forms. We said yes, we sent them in twice. Then they said they didn't receive the banking code, which is plainly on all the forms. We sent it in again. We haven't heard anything since, which was about a month ago. They're scamming us and obviously want us to give up out of frustration. Not gonna happen! We will harangue them till we finally go to Athens and talk to them face to face. It's absurd and horrible business practices.

### “Terrible customer service”
I was made to check my bag in and pay 50 EUR. I asked if I could keep it with me as it fit the size and weight of cabin baggage and they said no despite this flight being very empty. The air hostesses were also really rude and not understanding. I had to book this flight as their codeshare flight was delayed and I missed my connection so after a 5 hour wait at the airport they decided to charge me for luggage and to not let me have it on board with me. Terrible customer service.

### "our bags were not loaded"
In the transfer between the Cairo flight and the Barcelona flight, our bags were not loaded and when we got to Barcelona our bags were nowhere to be found. Our Air Tags told us that our bags were still in Athens. I filed a claim at the AVI Partners counter and they gave me confidence that they knew that our bags would be delivered by 1:30 the next day. In the morning our air tags told me that they had been flown early in the day to Madrid and then later to Barcelona. At 1:00 I tried to call then number on the claim and it said (in Spanish) that it was an unmonitored number despite it was on the form to call for updates. I got in a taxi and went to the airport and found the AVI Partners was about to close at 3:00 pm. I caught the lady she did not speak English, but I showed her my phone and the status and the paper, I kept pointing to the phone and finally we got someone that spoke English. These people had no clue about the status of my bags. The English-speaking person at the Iberia counter took pity on me and looked at my air tags status and then with the use of her computer, found the bags in a storage locker  in the airport. Finally, after a walk through the airport and waiting 20 minutes emerged our 4 lost bags. The best part, was after I spent the time at the airport, and I paid for a taxi and got back to the hotel, I got an email from Aegean Airlines that my bags were being forwarded to my hotel. •Why did Aegean airlines not know my bags were in the airport?

### "Highly recommended! "
Easy and efficient airline. Super friendly staff! Comfortable airplanes and good in-flight food. I missed a transfer flight due to a delay and Aegean seamlessly put me up in a beautiful hotel, covered dinner and breakfast, and got me on the next flight. Highly recommended!

### "disappointed about the customer service"
Not Verified |  So disappointed about the customer service. The staff was so rude to me  and kept yelling “lady” in my face. Told me I had to repack my bags and check them while paying 40 euros after delaying our flight 2 hours. Just doesn’t seem fair to pay over what my ticket was with our flight being 2 hours delayed. Now I am not making my connecting flight and the woman at the front desk could not have been more rude or less helpful. Im incredibly disappointed.

### “I think it is an excellent airline”
Had booked the comfortable rate which has no clear advantages. It's good that they have more then one flight per day. Very good thing is that there is food in the economy class. There is Wi-Fi included which did not work. Cabin crew are OK, however too much make up. The captain spoke so loud. Generally, I think it is an excellent airline for greek/Mediterranean mentality/point of view.

### "Aegean took off 5 minutes ago"
I would not recommend flying with this airline. We had a flight from Athens to Tel Aviv while another company also had a flight around same time (20 minutes apart). The gates of these flights were next to each other and Aegean changed the gate of boarding an hour before the flight. Due to that, we were confused and sat in the gate of the other airline. When we were heading to the boarding desk we were told that it is the wrong airline and that our flight with Aegean took off 5 minutes ago. We went to their front desk hoping to find some help, but the only thing we heard was blaming us for missing the flight and claiming 1000€ to pay in order to have their next flight which was less than 5 hours apart. We were really disappointed.

### "a very good value fare"
Not Verified |  Another excellent flight with Aegean for a very good value fare. Two rounds of drinks (each round consisting of two drinks), sweets, biscuits and meal (far beyond what British Airways offers). Clean A321 neo. The airline magazine Blue is more of a travel almanac with eclectic articles on destinations and intriguing suggestions (such as the disused Orient Express train in suburban Athens at Rouf station). Friendly crew and flights on time.

### "refused to put us on the same flight"
Flight from Frankfurt to Athens for 1st February canceled and refused to put us on the same flight, same time, but departing from a nearby city. As a result, we had to pay twice the initial price to purchase new tickets at the last minute.

### “Thanks for ruining our honeymoon experience”
Not Verified | The worst experience in Greece has been Aegean airlines so far. Airport crew for Aegean are rude, cannot and do not communicate when they need to tell honeymooners they’re assigning you random seats and overriding the ones you have chosen, pretty much deny you basic privileges like carryon luggage (correct size and weight) because the flight is “full” and they’re randomly selecting which passengers get to keep their luggage and which don’t. Needless to say, we will be trying to avoid this airline at all costs after this travel. Thanks for ruining our Greece and honeymoon experience Aegean airlines.

### “no one has contacted us”
My luggage was lost, not a single email, message, nothing, no one has contacted us after 3 days. I wanted to visit my family for a couple of days for Christmas 2023 and this is what I'm dealing with. Even if it's found what good does it do if I'm going to get it that late. I am still trying to dig out some old clothes to be able to go out and visit my beloved ones.

### "went above and beyond the protocol"
Not Verified |  Ms. Zaharaki Anna is an oasis of kindness, kindness, professionalism and empathy in a corporate environment that seems to be losing ground!! A real example of imitation for her colleagues but also for every employee. Flight Athens Heraklion She went above and beyond the protocol, with a small act of enormous value. C Η κα Ζαχαράκη Άννα είναι μία όαση ευγένειας ,καλοσύνης επαγγελματισμού και ενσυναίσθησης σε ένα εταιρικό περιβάλλον που δείχνει να χάνει τον έδαφος ! ! Πραγματικό παράδειγμα μίμησης για τους συναδέλφους της αλλά και για κάθε εργαζόμενο .Πτήση Αθήνα Ηράκλειο Πήγε πέρα και πάνω από το πρωτόκολλο ,με μία μικρή πράξη τεράστιας όμως αξίας.

### “horrible money grabbing”
Not Verified | Horrible money grabbing policies. Recently flew with this airline from Athens to Istanbul. At the gate they were weighting the carry-on baggage. I am a seasoned traveler and have never seen such a practice even with low-cost carriers. This means they are desperate for money and hopefully will soon go broke. Also the personell at Athens airport is super rude and obviously under qualified. I will never fly Aegean again, horrible money grabbing and really bad management.

### "employees are disrespectful to me"
c✅ Trip Verified |  It is the 7th time that I fly with this airline the last 3 months and I am disappointed. The customer service at the airport is really awful. The employees are disrespectful to me and they think that they are doing me a favor when they speak to me. I am Greek and I feel really bad this company is the biggest airline in my home country. However the cabin crew is nice and helpful but that after the delays and high prices.

### "My case was 1.4 kgs overweight"
Not Verified |  I recently travelled with Aegean from Athens to Venice and return. l had a flex category ticket which allowed for a hand luggage (suitcase) and personal item in the cabin. On the outgoing flight, there was no issue whatsoever with my luggage. On the return flight, we were literally ambushed at the gate to weigh our cabin suitcase. My case was 1.4 kgs overweight. I offer to pay for the extra weigh but they said it needed to go with checked luggage and they charged 50 euro. I checked later Aegean's site extra luggage calculator and the price to pay at the airport for an extra suitcase up to 23 kilos is shown to be 42 euro. They charged 50 euro for a less than 10 kilo suitcase. They did not give us time to lighten the luggage and avoid the extra cost as they were boarding and the flight was already in delay. The gate personel was hassling passengers and was rude to say the least. The lady working behind the gate counter was banging her hand on the desk and shouting to the couple next to me (also complaining about the surcharge) to learn to read the company policies in a condescending manner. I used to prefer Aegean over other air carriers although they offer very little legroom and a poor meal choice as I considered them reliable. This, however , was a bad experience, I feel ripped off and disrespected and I don't see a reason to continue bringing them my business. I hope they enjoy the surcharge they arbitrarily imposed as these were the last of my money they see. Their attitude was both unprofessional and uncivilized.

### “good customer service”
Not Verified | Very good and comfortable airline. There are rarely delays. Nice staff and good customer service. Already once again I made sure that it is worth choosing this airline.

### "it used to be the best company, now it is a joke"
Not Verified |  Terrible as Aegean always is over the last 2 years. Delayed flight, they asked us to board and left us waiting 15 minutes standing next to the landing area with children running around and invisibly an accident could easily happen. Except for that, we flew business and for food the only option was ham and cheese sandwich. Obviously no vegan option available and if for some reason you couldn’t eat ham (as it was our case) then you wouldn’t eat. It is a shame as it used to be the best company, now it is a joke.

### "delayed over more than 1 hour"
Not Verified |  Heraklion to Athens only take 36 mins airtime, the flight is delayed over more than 1 hour. Over 90% people on the aircraft had layover, we missed our connection. The compensation of the delay is 8 euro. Aegean down sized the aircraft but over sold the ticket. This happens on Oct 5 from Santorini to Athens for the 9:10PM flight. The gate announcements was looking for someone willing to give up the seats for over booking. And same time, we noticed the aircraft was down size to Olympic from Aegean aircraft. The only thing i would say they give water onboard.

### "lost the connecting flight"
After a very big delay in Vienna airport we lost the connecting flight to Heraklion. We had no choice but overnight in Athens. We were offered a voucher for a free flight international or domestic flight and when we wanted to redeem it they were charging more taxes than booking a flight without the voucher. It has become one of the worst airlines to fly with.

### "Great airline"
Great airline. On time, careful landing and take off. Lots of information aboard both in Greek and English. And they fed us - a couple of small pastries, fruit and a breakfast bar along with two drinks - almost unheard of on European planes but much appreciated. Only down side was the tightness of the seating space.

### "$50 to check carry on bags"
On our  connecting flight from Mykonos to Athens, they made us pay $50 to check carry on bags. All bags hit carry on size requirements and made it through security just fine. Due to the sudden need to make passengers check all bags, several of us missed our connecting flights. We were over 40 min late for take off.

### "out of my last 20 flights only one was on time"
I am gold on Aegean for the last ten years or so. I avoid flying this airline as much as possible. I can certify that out of my last 20 flights with this airline over the last two years, only one was on time. The airline has cut deep in operations and has contracted the worst ground services around their destinations. It shows every day in their inability to execute a flight schedule that is unrealistic at best. This current flight is leaving an hour late for no reason. The plane came to Athens on time from a previous destination - I checked. At Athens, they were unable to turn it around on time and picked an extra hour. Again, operations and a poor schedule. Boarding at Venice was a zoo. All classes mixed. Held in a very hot bus for a long time before rushing to the plane. The plane - a 16 years old 320 with ragged seats and completely filthy from previous flight. Total disgrace and what happens when ground services are low quality. Once landed, naturally the same bus experience again. Priority luggage comes out last. Avoid Aegean. There's an alternative for almost every destination. They are a third world airline.

### "Amazing atmosphere on board2
It was my first experience with Aegean  Airlines. I have heard many good reviews about AEGEAN Airlines and I was really touched how good it was. Aegean Airlines is a out-standing old-school, traditional experience. Great variety of drinks, hot food on europeans airlines, which is not something common nowadays. Amazing atmosphere on board. For me 5/5 experience. Well done! Other airlines should learn a lot from them!

### "would never recommend them to anyone"
Not Verified |  Worst airline ever! I would never recommend them to anyone, they delayed my luggage for 5 days! Customer service is rude and useless, they do not help you with any information. I am a student, who I had everything needed for my replacement in Spain. Never recommended!

### "Never give them your luggage"
Not Verified | The worst airline ever! They lost our luggage and never attempted to help us find them. Never give them your luggage, clothes or valuables to these people! You are never getting them back when you reach your destination. They are the worst airline ever!

### "very limited leg space"
This airline is eight out of ten times with delays always blaming airports, refuelling, weather and what have you. There is very very limited leg space and I am average sized, planes usually unwashed and paint is becoming dull. Every single time the air steward pass through the aisle she bumps on someone and carelessly carries on. On a good note I am using their onboard WiFi to write this review which is working apparently...

### "arrived 1 hour late"
Istanbul to Athens, arrived 1 hour late. Worst airline I’ve ever flown with. Had different flights with Aegean and every one got delayed by at least an hour. The airline treats departure times as if they were suggestions. On my last flight I was lucky enough to make my connection but numerous people were not.

### "really helpful and friendly staff"
We fly with Aegean almost every summer to Greece and are always satisfied. They have really helpful and friendly staff, which makes the atmosphere onboard really comfortable. They treat you like customers, and also serve food with great choice of beverages on short haul. However, the legroom could be bigger.

### "eventually got the luggage back"
Not Verified |  The trip was ok overall , but we had trouble with our luggage when arriving in Bucharest. It was lost, we put a baggage claim form and they said that they would call us when the luggage wil, arrrive in Buchrest, but we did not receive any call. I tried calling the company about 20 times, but nobody answered. When my husband went to the airport and tried to claim the luggage he waited for 1 hour before someone could talk to him. We eventually got the luggage back, but with a lot of stress and uncertainty.

### "Terrible service"
Not Verified |  Terrible service, two of our bags are stuck in Athens, it is the 5th day now! On the 4th day they sent 1 of the bags to a different island, I could see that thanks to the air tag, then the bag was promised to come the same day to Heraklion, but is still stuck in Athens. Terrible service of Aegean who do absolutely nothing to help and just ignore the calls and emails. Worst experience ever, never ever Greece again!

### "lost my bag for over a week"
This airline has the worst customer service imaginable. They lost my bag for over a week and I had to use an airtag to track it down because they never delivered it to my hotel like they said they would. They told me to submit a form to be reimbursed for the stuff I had to buy for my trip and have followed up multiple times with no responses via email. When I call, they tell me someone will follow up after I have submitted the form even though I've already submitted it.

### "so much lost luggage"
A piece of luggage lost between Athens and Santorini. Claim made at the airport as requested. The subcontractor Goldair Handling could not be reached, after relaunch by email, he replied that he had found the luggage and then retracted, it was a mistake. He asks us to contact Aegean, impossible to reach the lost baggage service. By consulting the search form I notice several errors on my coordinates and the brand of the suitcase is missing. So they search without knowing what to look for and who to warn. The only information given to me by their customer service is that there is so much lost luggage

### "Boarding is a mess"
Not Verified | Boarding is a mess, only on our outbound from Copenhagen was boarding structured. The sheer chaos of boarding in Athens defies belief, yelling and pushing, the employees was rude and aggressive. The planes are not kept clean which is too bad since a big part of the fleet is brand new. It is clear that there is ambition to be a full service carrier on a high level. The execution however is lagging. I am convinced that the regular delays out of Athens would be gone if the boarding process was fixed.

### "wanted to weigh all cabin bags"
I have been a regular traveller of the airline and last few times I noticed a decline in quality. In this last flight we were flying 2 person with flex ticket. We were allowed to onboard luggage with 2 personal items and a 23kg bag to be checked in. We went to the checking were they weighted all of our luggage the carryons were 9 and 10 kg and the checked in 19. They didn't tell us the cabin bags were overweight so that we can put the extra weight in the checked in bag when we arrived at the gate they wanted to weigh all cabin bags and found us overweight. There was a lady there who told us to put all in one bag so that we only pay 50 euros for 1 instead for each cabin bag. We just took out some clothes and wore them and they were ok with it.

### "we were delaying the rest in the bus"
We had priority to access the plane with kids, the service was ok, the plane brand new and nice clear sky flight. Everything was going so good until we landed in Athens. We waited at the last moment to leave the plane a we had kids and luggage. While we were about to start leaving the plane two cabin crew in a very unpolite way told us, two families with kids, that we had to disembark immediately. They told the other family to wake up their kids as we were delaying the rest in the bus.

### "flight itself was not bad at all"
Not Verified | The flight itself was not bad at all. However the crew at the airport in Athen was very unfriendly and unprofessional. My luggage was a little overweight. When I merely wanted to explain myself or gather information the person attending to me left me to go get a colleague who then had to deal with me because he/she didn't feel like doing it. The rate for the overweight luggage is way too high. And if the airline feels like it needs to get in some extra money they should please check the weight of everyone's hand luggage not just selected passengers. If they were to make the tickets a little pricier from the beginning but therefore reduce the hassle at the counter my journey would have been more pleasant and not started with frustration.

### "Very poor service"
At check-in, we were told that our checked baggage was too heavy (limit 8kg/17lbs even though the website said 23kg/50lb limit), and we needed to reduce the weight. We were put to the side so we could move our dirty laundry from the suitcases and put into tote bags (purchased from the nearby shop) that we could carry on. This was both embarrassing and frustrating. The plane was an hour late for our connecting flight. They didn't tell us, but fortunately (after running through the airport), our connection was also late, so we did make the plane. They stopped food service short, so the last 5 rows didn't get any food. This was not due to weather, but just bad timing of the stewards. We still had 30 minutes to land, so they could have quickly handed out the sandwiches, but they decided not to provide service to the last few rows. I don't know if it was due to poor planning of the start of food service, or of taking too much time in the middle rows. Instead of treating us like the rest of the passengers, we felt like 3rd class citizens. Very poor service.

### "We expected meaningful compensation"
I had a flight me and my husband from Stockholm to Cairo with connection flight in Athens. The connecting flight number was A3930, from Athens to Cairo. The planned departure time was 11:55 pm June 25th. The flight was delayed by nearly 6 hours from the planned departure time. We were informed the flight will be delayed for 1 hour before boarding. Before the new departure time, we boarded normally. After that, a lot of time has passed “ more that 1 hour” while we are inside the aircraft and we don’t take off and no information were given to us by the crew. From the aircraft windows we could see some workers taking bags in and out the aircraft. The crew told us they are having problems with luggage. We are kept in the aircraft to nearly 4 hours before the captain told us that we can leave the aircraft and go to sit in the airport till the problem is solved. Nothing was offered to us in the airport, no food, drinks or anything. In the meantime I tried to contact the Aegean Airlines hotline to help us, it was nearly 5:00 am already, but the contact person told me that she can not know any information about my flight situation because she has a limited access to information and she cannot help and I can call again after 7:00 am for another contact who has more access. At nearly 6:00 am the crew called us to board again but we didn’t take off till 6:35 anyways because the crew was replaced by a new one. We reached Cairo airport finally to find that our baggage didn’t reach Cairo airport anyway and we waited for 2 weeks till they reached Cairo airport. The delay collectively was from 11:55 pm to 6:35 am. We expected an apology on what happened and meaningful compensation as an acknowledgment of what they did. We complained to the company and their reply was that they were sorry for the delay and they offered the least compensation stated by passengers’ rights “250 euros”. They mentioned nothing about the problems that are caused by the poor handling of the problems they had.

### "Very poor customer service"
Very poor customer service. I am travelling with a baby paid to be in the front rows and when I wanted to add an extra seat for my daughter everything started. They asked me if I want the same seats, I said yes and they put me and the 5 month old baby in different seats. I asked that obviously we need to be together. Then they moved me in to row 19. Then they couldn’t find me on the flight, they couldn’t give me a seat with the excuse that it’s not for the baby when it was before. Then they asked me to send an email somewhere else if I wanted to take back my money and when I insisted that’s crazy they said ok we will refund you and send you an email, nothing received. They really don’t know what they are doing there.

### "Poor customer service"
Party of 4, 2 couples traveling together, last minute 1 hour before our seats changed. I upgraded everyone to row 11, now one is in 11, 3 are in 26th row. We were told the plane changed and we can't honor your seat selection. Poor customer service. We were not the only party where the seats changed. When I called customer service he stated well this happens occasionally

### "inconsiderate and extremely incompetent"
Not Verified | This is one of the worst experiences I’ve ever dealt with through the use of an airline. It was the most frustrating, time-consuming and displeasing experience imaginable when attempting to travel via plane. No matter what, never use Aegean Airlines under any circumstances. The staff were inconsiderate and extremely incompetent, showing no regard for the passengers well being and failing to explain any of the trouble we were put through. The staff and airline in general had no interest in doing their job properly and ultimately put me through the worst airline experience possible.

### "lost all our luggage"
Not Verified | On the way to Santorini airplane lost all our luggage - 3 bags! They found it after 4 days. On the way back they lost another bag! After 12 days they cannot find it. Lost luggage department at Florence Airport provided us with email address and phone number. All our emails are bouncing back.

### "pretty bad track record"
Not Verified | We took 3 flights with Aegean and would not recommend them to anyone. Had 3 issues: 1. They overbooked our flight and bumped many people. We bought our flight 3 months ahead, but checked in about 18 hours before our flight (they allow check-in up to 24 hours ahead). We were issued a “standby” ticket without any seats. When we got to the gate, we were told we may or may not get onto the flight and if we didn’t then we would have to wait 4 hours for the late night flight, or try again in the morning. Lots of other people in the same situation. We were never issued boarding passes but we kept following up with the person at the ticket counter until they gave us passes, it seems like due to our persistence and nothing systematic. Luckily we got on that flight, but others didn’t. Nowhere in the policy does it say that whether or not you get on the flight is related to your check-in time. If you take Aegean, check in right away and be persistent about asking for seats! 2. They apply a checked bag policy at will. We were sitting near the gate. The gate attendants approached us and asked to weigh our bags. Our bags, which fit easily into any overhead bin (including previous Aegean flights) were found to be slightly overweight (apparently 9kgs are allowed, ours were about 10kgs). We asked if we could move 1kg into our purse / backpack. They said no, they need to check the two bags, and by the way they are charging us 40Euro per bag. This was for a 45 min flight from an island to Athens. We had no choice and were forced to pay. Also, there was no consistency in the way this rule was applied. We saw plenty of other people with carry-ons larger than ours allowed on the plane and there was plenty of space in the overhead bins. 3. Every flight we were on was late. Two of three were late by over 45 mins. We didn’t have any connections, but I imagine many connecting flights were missed. And, this didn’t happen to us, but it’s worth noting that when we landed in Athens, there were about 30 people waiting at the lost baggage desk. Most of them looked very angry. I asked one person what happened, and apparently an entire flight did not have their bags transferred at a connection. So not only will they force you to check your carry-on and then pay for a checked bag, they might lose it too. All-in-all, this is a pretty bad track record for 3 short island hop flights.

### "would like to thank the employee"
Passengers of  delayed Aegean Airlines flight 01.07.2023 stuck in Santorini, would like to thank the employee of the Aegean Airlines company from Thessaloniki, Markati, for her non-formal attitude, patience and professionalism! This combination of qualities is rare in our modern life. We wholeheartedly thank this wonderful girl and in her person your company, which helped us in a difficult situation.

### "FA were courteous and helpful"
Boarding in Munich was a rush, however business class passengers did receive a welcome drink - Greek sparkling wine or water. The lunch had several options and there was a choice between 2 red and white Greek wines. The food was not bad at all. Decent information about the flight was given. FA were courteous and helpful. One of the better business products in Europe for sure. Only luggage was not quite delivered as "priority" despite labelled.

### "baggage came with 1 hour delay and broken"
The baggage came with 1 hour delay and broken. Since then over a month has passed and I have not yet been refunded or received new baggage. On the telephone they do nothing except saying it is summer and it is normal to delay. Definitely not the company it used to be. Low cost company with premium company's prices.

### "Worst service ever experienced"
Not Verified | The have option of buying tickets with unlimited ticket changes yet, the charge you same amount to change flight date as if was a new ticket. Furthermore the don’t accept to use a credit voucher for it, and they don’t give the money back! Worst service ever experienced!

### "seats were changed, splitting up the party"
Booked over 9 months in advance and opted for comfortflex fare, which included baggage, onboard wifi access and upfront seat selection. We chose seats right at the front of the economy cabin at time of booking, allowing party to sit together (we were all on same booking). Aircraft was advertised as a new A321NEO with free wifi. However after checking in online, aircraft had changed and subsequently seats were changed, splitting up the party. Flight itself was comfortable with decent leg room and free food/drinks, though quality was lacklustre. Crew were absent in any form of engagement on board, appearing distant.

### "my baggage did not arrive"
I arrived in Athens the 20th of June from Johannesburg / Addis Ababa on Ethiopian Airlines, connecting on Aegean Airlines from Cairo to Athens and my baggage did not arrive with me. When I went to report the loss there was no one at the counter and a person had to be phoned to come. My holiday in Greece is nearly over and my baggage has still not been located after 11 days. The customer care phone line is never answered.

### "they changed our seats"
They made us wait at the gate for boarding for more than an hour. No explanation that there was a delay or no explanation why we weren’t boarding the plane. Rude and unhelpful staff in Malaga. We paid extra to get seats together with my partner but they changed our seats to separate rows a week before the flight. No one helped us to sit together even though we paid to choose seats next to each other.

### "All in all a great airline"
My wife and I flew Aegean Airlines for the first time June 7, 2023. These were two short flights consisting of Sophia, Bulgaria to Athens and Athens to Larnaca, Cyprus. Both flights were exceptional. The flights were smooth and the seats were comfortable. The cabin service was outstanding. We received a snack (more of a light meal) on each flight, and both were delicious. The first flight included a small sandwich roll with sliced chicken and cheese; the second flight included a pasta salad with tuna and dressing. We enjoyed every bite! As we were leaving the plane in Larnaca I commented to the cabin staff at the exit of the plane that Aegean Airlines was now my new favorite airline. And it is. I opted to give the airline a rating of 9 instead of 10 due to two items: both flights were short. Had the flights been longer (more of a test of the airline service), I would have given the maximum rating. Also, Aegean's website is not as intuitive as most others I've used. All in all a great airline: comfortable, affordable, and frankly, just a pleasure to fly.

### "Crew was friendly"
I did win upgrade challenge and I travelled Business Class though the airport does not offer Business Lounge. In the internet you will find information that Rhodes Diagoras Airport has two lounges but that is not right any more. With the new managment Lounges were closed. There was priority boarding, even though we were boarded on a bus. Crew was friendly and plane was in a good condition. We were boarded but we had a 20 minutes delay on departure due to Athens Traffic Controlers. In flight service was good and the copilot explained the route with details. We landed and parked in Athens on remote location but was a priority bus service for the Business passengers.

### "overbooked the flight"
The airline overbooked the flight and told me that I did not have a seat in the plane. They wasted one day of my European tour. In addition, I had to see my parents in Athens and me not flying created significant problems to our family trip. La compagnia aerea ha sovrevenduto il volo e mi ha detto che non avevo un posto sull'aereo. Hanno sprecato un giorno del mio tour europeo. Inoltre, dovevo incontrare i miei genitori ad Atene e il fatto di non poter volare ha creato problemi significativi al nostro viaggio familiare.

### "did not wear a name tag"
Not Verified |  Check-in uneventful. Boarding a zoo with a rude employee denying me boarding, claiming some zone story. Upon boarding I found a number of passengers that were probably the right 'zone' since they were seated in the rear already. An old ATR POS that Aegean must likely keep to connect some small islands that cannot accommodate jets. Why they would use these consistently for the third largest Greek island is unclear to me. Once seated in 15C and having put my backpack above, I see the flight attendant pushing it to make space for someone's big suitcase. When I objected, she pulled it down and told me in the rudest way to put it under the seat in front of me. Said attendant did not wear a name tag.

### "Crew was friendly and helpful"
Delay due to aircraft controllers. There was 1 hour delay due to late arrival of the airplane. Plane was an A320ceo on a good condition. Fully booked flight on economy, only one person on business. Crew was friendly and helpful moving luggage to the bins. No IFE only drop down screens where you can watch the flight path. Inflight service was consisted of ham or vegetable sandwich and a digestive bar with alcoholic drink/beer/beverage.

### "Please keep up the excellent work"
Aegean Airlines will remain always my first choice and my favorite airline. The best Airline in Europe without any doubt. Cabin crew are so helpful, patient and supportive. Please keep up the excellent work and I hope that Aegean will make long haul flights soon.

### "kept up the high standards"
Aegean Airlines Economy Class LHR-ATH (and back). Aegean have kept up the high standards and are the best airline flying from the UK to Greece. Two rounds of drinks, a snack and a meal comparable to the pre-Covid catering level. This is far above any other airline's offering on this route. The inflight magazine provides detailed guides to places in Greece and I was able to track the flight's progress via wi-fi. That said, I miss the overhead screens with the moving map! Friendly crew and comfortable leg room on the A321NEO, flights on time or ahead of schedule both legs.

### "my experience was anything but pleasant"
This was my first time flying with Aegean, and my experience was anything but pleasant. Starting from when I checked-in at the counter, I have an SA Gold member where I get 20kg of free luggage, but the staff there says I have to pay another 45 Eur even though it should be free, and I explained that I have SA Gold and it should be free because I had a return ticket and I got 20kg free but the staff didn't care but tore the baggage tag in front of me and told me to go to the ticket agent at the airport, luckily the agent helped me a little bit to help me input manually, even though my status was still valid instead will be extended until next year. The second problem was when I was about to board in Athens, when it was my turn they stopped me and asked for a Moroccan visa or residence permit, I said my passport didn't need a visa to Morocco for up to 3 months and I even gave him a look at the Moroccan visa policy and he really didn't care.

### "The ground crew were poor"
The flight I was on for returning to Athens on 15 March was cancelled. We were informed this was due to weather. Passengers were told initially that the flight was delayed by 30 minutes, then another delay announcement just as passengers were getting emails informing of flight cancellation. The ground crew were poor at making sure there was clarity in their announcements. I went up to a staff member when most people who appeared to be Corfu residents had just gone home, and asked was there any hotel booking arrangements - "No", any hotel used in such circumstances, don't know, any cost max, don't know, what about meals, don't know. Reclaiming? - "you have to go to Aegean office in Athens". I spoke to a British Corfu resident who said most expensive hotel open was Corfu Palace. I chose to go somewhere with a little better location and not so expensive. I then found out from the lady that just after I left, she was told that anyone needing a hotel could go to the Corfu Palace and all meals etc were covered and no need to pay. So, overall great experience - really well done ground crew: vital information not provided on a timely basi. The later flight was full as the following day was a general strike in Greece - so 2 nights had to stay in Corfu. On return flight cabin crew tolfd me there was no issue with the weather, the aircraft had a fault that could not be fixed in Corfu. Aegean states 10 days to get back to passenger with complaint, it is now 19 days. It is now 19 days and not a word from Aegean. This was my 3rd flight with Aegean. Their aircraft seem better than Sky Express their competitor, but my experience has really turned me off Aegean.

### "refused me with my laptop and small carry on"
A company that can be excellent but it started working like a cheap airline. Today for the first time they refused me to fly with my laptop and my small carry on. It did not matter that I am gold member.

### "In Flight Service was nice"
Boarding was on time but with buses, welcome was friendly and tentative. We departed on time. There was WiFi available on the flight and is free on Business Class. In Flight Service was nice and tasty. Breakfast was nice and coffee and mastiha drink was good (they omitted the chocolate stick that they supposed to offer)

### "the crew was very friendly"
The ground service was excellent. Onboard, the cabin was pretty spacious. The seats were kinda small, and the legroom was disappointing. The food was okay and the crew was very friendly. The Wi-fi and connectivity were excellent. Much respect for the airline.

### "pay checks for overweight of 8kg"
I’ve been traveling with Aegean many times since I live in Athens. I saw (me included) at least 10 pay checks for overweight of 8kg. After arguing with the ground representative, she literally told me not to board  this flight. I would say Aegean is apparently better than low fare airlines but staff need training to be professional and more polite.

### "I wanted to change my ticket"
The after sales service is very disappointing. Today I spent 58 minutes on the telephone, waiting for a representative of Aegean to talk to me. I wanted to change my ticket and unfortunately I didn’t manage to do it – although I waited for such a long time.

### "crew was very friendly and helpful"
The cabin crew was very friendly and helpful. Also at the check-in everything went smoothly. The complimentary snack served was a very small slice of pizza, a sesame cookie and a drink. The seats were too small for me. I am 1.92 m, 84 kg, and for me it was very uncomfortable.

### "fee to cancel was 45€/ticket"
We had made a FLEX (P) reservation, that we had to cancel due to pregnancy. The extra fee to cancel was 45€/ticket. This is something we already knew. What we didn't know is that the only way to cancel is through their Call Center. But in that case, which is actually the only possible case, there is an extra Call Center fee of 20€/ticket. At the same time, all the extra services you have purchased (even if there is no such clause in the "Terms & Conditions" we agreed on), meaning extra baggage, purchased selected seats etc, are turned into some kind of "owed service" valid for a year. Not a voucher valid for a year, the service must have been used, not purchased, in a year. Finally, for some undetectable reason the refund had to take place, not automatically to the card we used to make the reservation, but we had to fill out another form, one for each ticket/passenger, with our bank account details, for the reimbursements to take place separately and via bank accounts.

### "Zero customer service"
Three passengers paid for extra legroom for both legs of our trip, Madrid - Athens and Athens - Larnaca. On the online system and on the reservations we were given extra legroom seats. At the ticket issuance at the airport these were changed to normal seats without any explanation. We were advised to write an email for refund. Wrote an email on June 19th 2022. Since then, wrote 4 more emails, phoned the airline 5 times and each time they told me they see the case and i am right but they cannot do anything about it because they are ticketing and customer service can only be contacted via email. Eight months later and no reply, no acknowledgement nor refund. Zero customer service, zero respect for client.

### "has no loyalty to its loyal clients"
Not Verified |  This company has scammed me severely on my last trip! I missed my connecting flight due to their delay and they rebooked everyone a ticket for free but not for me! I literally had to buy a new ticket and fly the next day. When I asked for a refund they stalled and never gave me a proper response! When I called customer service they told me to wait for customer service to review my request and they will respond in 7 days. Its been a month and nothing! They tried to say it was not their fault! This is an overpriced company that has no loyalty to its loyal clients! They try to mislead you treating you like an incompetent person! I will never fly with this airline again and I regret every penny I spent on them! Disgraceful!

### "Super small space between seats"
Good things:  usually rather new planes, depending on the route, usually good schedules, depending on the route. Super small space between seats at row 10. If you fly with children, the family will be placed automatically at the very end of the plane. The automatic sitting system separates families and assign them seats randomly in different rows. If you’re a frequent flyer with Aegean (Gold), forget about redeeming the upgrade vouchers if you fly with a child. They don’t want children in business. Aegean became extraordinarily expensive and mediocre since the pandemic. A shame, as they were quite good. Greek competitor Sky Express offers a good service for cheaper prices.

### "told I was a standby passenger"
At airport check-in 3 hours early I was told I was a standby passenger, despite booking months in advance and receiving a confirmation. I was told this was the policy of overbooking flights by 10%

### "Very poor service"
Terrible service and handling of delayed and then cancelled flight. Understaffed to change boarding pass so we had to wait for hours in line. Very poor service.

### "Never flying with them again"
The first flight from Zurich to Athens was perfect & without any problems. However the second flight back was horrible and unorganized. Everything started when the gate opened & the boarding started. They started to weight luggage and created a huge queue. I had a hand luggage, which was taken by them, because the haven't had anymore space in the airplane. My Father had a hand luggage too, but they didn't take his with them. When we arrived in front of the airplane with the bus, they started to check, which luggage had a tag on it, so they can take it with them. In the airplane they were organizing the luggage above our heads & trying to make more space. However my Father's luggage was too much, so I had to go in front of the Airplane to give it to them. They had to take it with them and store it with the other ones under us. The plane was almost 30 Minutes late. Never flying with them again.

### "professional cabin crew"
Best Airline in Europe, professional cabin crew, smiley and helpful. Receiving updates about my flight all the time. The thing that might really need an improvement is the FQT program (Miles + Bonus) , they must be more flexible in transferring and receiving points from other Airlines.

### "could easily have been avoided"
An experience that was neither good or bad until we tried to order water for our 2 year old. We ordered it, was asked to wait while the cabin crew was giving out hot food. After 20min we asked again and we were asked to wait. After another 20min, she started to cry uncontrollably, and we walked up to the crew (who was still busy giving out hot meal) that we really needed to give our child some water. When we finally got it, it was impossible to stop our girl from crying even when she got the water (well, most parents would understand that it was too late and the damage has already been done). So after calming her down (which took another 10-15min) she started to drink and became happy again. It was a bad experience for everyone, our 2 year old, us as her parents and all other passengers. A situation that could easily have been avoided, which would have been nice as flying with kids often means stress. Why couldn’t a person in the crew just stop for 1minute and help out? They didn’t even seemed bothered or at least a bit guilty when we explained that we couldn’t continue waiting because a 2 year old doesn’t understand that.

### "you will not get any support if something goes wrong"
Although my flight was not delayed or canceled, I had a horrible experience. My luggage was damaged and I have submitted my complaint immediately. I have also documented everything with photos and requested a refund, but I only received confirmation that my complaint was recorded and since then, the company keeps ignoring my e-mails. Also, I got charged extra 40 euros for having an additional piece of luggage only when departing my destination and not on the other three flights (I had one stop at Athens). I am very disappointed with Aegean, so I do not recommend it to others because you will not get any support if something goes wrong.

### "One of the best airline apps I have tried so far!"
Great airline! I fly regularly with Aegean Airlines, and it is always my number one choice. Especially the new planes are really nice, and the service on board is good too. The food is really not that bad, especially in business class. However, Economy is great as well. There are some nice touches with Aegean, like how they inform you when your flight is delayed. They email you, and you get a notification in the app. About the app, it works really good. One of the best airline apps I have tried so far! I don't have any complaints. Even after dozens of flights, no problems at all!

### "My bag was delayed"
Worst baggage experience ever. My bag was delayed at my connection in Athens on 9th August 2022 and Aegean has not responded to my request for first need expense, multiple attempts to reach them via email, and when I called the automated line said "We do not have the resources to handle your request" The worst part is I paid extra to check my bag.

### "simply got worse in service"
Larnaca to Athens. I fly Aegean twice weekly almost every single week of the year. And I could say that 90% of the times their flights are delayed, specially the ones towards the end of the day. And it is not due to the overall mess that happened this past summer I'm so many European airpors. I can understand that delays pile up along the day but, knowing that this happens, they should review their schedules. Or try to catch up during the flight. The excuse is most times the same, the ridiculous "late arrival of the aircraft" (thank you!). Their app is also faulty lately (you call then, show them, and still don't accept it, things like not being able to check in, wrong pricing information, no incoming messages with flight delays, etc. Also, when they change planes and they cannot relocate you in a pay seat, you have to call them to get a refund! What they don't miss is to send a a silly survey upon landing asking about the quality of the service on board ("forcing" you to chose an area of improvement! ), while not asking for the end-to-end experience (from reservation, check in, baggage drop, boarding, disembarkation, luggage). They deserve some competition, they've simply got worse in service, unfortunately for those of us hooked to them.

### "a very bad experience"
Santorini to Athens. We had a very bad experience with Aegean Airlines. I bought two tickets and by right have combined baggage of 46kgs - however, when we dropped off our baggage, the staff told us Aegean don't combine baggage and charged us for excessive baggage charges although our actual bags combined only 43kgs. Also they dont accept one of our hand carry suitcase as well which have been travelled through so many airlines like Qatar and Swiss with no issues and charge us another baggage charges. Unless you want to be ripped off by this airlines otherwise I highly unrecommend Aegean because they will find all their ways to rip you.

### "dysfunctional bureaucracy"
Not Verified |  Corfu to Skopje via Athens. On August 4, 2022, my husband and I were traveling from Corfu, Greece on Aegean 285 to Skopje, North Macedonia on Aegean 984 operated by Olympic. Upon arrival in Skopje we were informed our luggage had been lost. We filed a lost baggage report at the Skopje airport. Once in Skopje all we had was the clothes on our backs. We spent the first two days of our vacation milling around an unknown city trying to find clothing and personal items and dealing with Aegean Airlines dysfunctional bureaucracy. On August 10, 2022, we returned home to the States empty handed and no word from Aegean regarding our lost luggage. Our calls and emails went unanswered. 10 days later we finally received our luggage that was come how found in Austria. We filed a reimbursement claim for initial expenses accrued in Skopje, for personal items and clothing replacement. Once again no word from Aegean. I repeated this process 3 times to no avail. Aegean airlines is run by sociopaths. They pretend nothing happened on their watch and choose to ignore any problems that happen on their airline. Trust me when I say I am not the only one affected by these grifters.

### "luggage is delayed"
Aegean Airlines forced me to check my hand luggage too without additional fee. I checked it in the departure airport (Yerevan) and when I arrived at my destination airport (Hamburg) I got a notification from Aegean app that my hand luggage which they forced me to check as a 2nd piece of luggage is delayed. In  Hamburg Airport I could not find the responsible person for Aegean Airlines who will help mein this situation.

### "had to buy my own meal"
They delayed our departing flight so we missed the flight to our final destination. They then booked us a new flight the next day at 7 am but in order to make the flight we had to take a bus at 5 am. For the inconvenience they provided a complimentary food voucher to use in Athens. When I tried using the voucher the funds were not applied. The cashier told me to go speak with an Aegean Airline employee. I then went to speak with an Aegean Airline help desk employee and due to our language barrier she did not understand what I was telling her so I never got the funds and had to buy my own meal.

### "flight attendants were nice"
I recently had 2 flights with Aegean, both of which were not bad. RHO to ATH and ATH to AMS. On the 2nd flight, I did see an attendant walking around the airport waiting room looking at bags, but she never weighed or measured anything. Both times the planes were delayed, though in their defense, most of the time I've flown in Europe pre and post pandemic, flights are delayed. The flight attendants were nice on both flights - always smiles and always helping. They never seemed to be unhappy, and some of the best I've encountered. I was impressed that they served a light meal and a beverage on my 3.5 hour flight and beer or wine didn't cost anything. Tui on the other hand, for the same length of flight, charged for food and/or drink and the leg room was much smaller, though their TUI allows 10kgs of carry-on luggage v. 8kgs for Aegean. I'd rather have the luggage allowance higher than the light meal and drink. The major thing that was scary was that almost everyone had left the airport in Athens before my moms luggage came off.

### "The best airline in Europe"
The best airline in Europe, professional cabin crew, comfortable seats and excellent service. It was a pleasure to fly with you. Keep up the good work and wishing you all the success.

### "passed only once for drinks"
For a 3.45 hour Helsinki to Athens flight we got served a sandwich and the flight attendants passed only once for drinks. The airline has delays particularly at flights after the morning.

### "luggage arrived nine and twelve days later"
Very early morning departure from Tbilisi with a crew that already worked through the night. The male purser, during the preflight information, informed transfer passengers to check luggage procedures in Athens in the inflight magazine - we did it and found out that connecting in Athens from Non-Schengen to Schengen means you have to pick up your luggage, take it through customs and check it in again. With the official 1:05h connecting time it sounded sporty. A biscuit, yogurt, and drinks were served as breakfast, then crew then went behind the curtains and did not show up again until the final approach to Athens. During the descent, they asked the passengers to put the garbage including cups with liquids into the seat pockets. Delayed by 40 minutes we landed in Athens. During taxiing, the purser advised transit passengers to rush to their gates. We made our connection by running and thanks to no traffic at the border guards. Our luggage arrived nine and twelve days later following a lengthy search, no support from Aegean Airlines, no answer to any call or any mail.

### "Meal was good for a 90 min flight"
Athens to Beirut on an A321. Business class seat is the same as in Economy, hard and rather uncomfortable. Meal was good for a 90 min flight, both in quality and quantity, though I find the pasta with chicken combination weird. No champagne available, only sparkling wine, but good offer of beverages and Greek liquors. Crew young, well-groomed, with some members being somehow snobbish. No WiFi and no entertainment. Will not fly again such a product in Business. On the other side, the brand new Aegean business class at Athens airport for extra-Schenghen flights is quite impressive, in terms of decor, ambiance and food / drinks selection: well done Aegean.

### "seats reservation was not allowed"
We are both Star Alliance Gold status holders. We booked a full price Economy class Lufthansa tkt from MRS to Mykonos via MUC & ATH, at a price where seat selection is guaranteed. MRS-MUC-ATH with LH, ATH-JMK flight was an Aegean flight. After purchasing, seats reservation on ATH-JMK flight was not allowed. We wrote and call Aegean, no answer. 48 hours before that specific flight Aegean automatically booked 2 separate seats in the last row. We were allowed to change those seat, paying 6 Euros. This is so petty, that it is ridiculous.

### "change those seat, paying 12 Euros"
We booked a full price Economy class ticket from Lufthansa, at a price where seat selection is guaranteed. ATH-MUC flight was an Aegean flight. After purchasing, seats reservation on ATH-MUC flight was not allowed. We wrote and call Aegean, no answer. 48 hours before that specific flight Aegean automatically booked 2 separate seats in the back of the aircraft. We were allowed to change those seat, paying 12 Euros.

### "Aegean exceeded my expectations"
Aegean exceeded my expectations. Didn't expected a snack and few drinks service on a few hours flight. I asked one extra beer when we started our descending and the crew handed out one with a smile. Way more better than other European airlines. I really hope they will earn five star airline status.

### "I had to pay 50 euros more"
I showed them my ticket to board on the plane. They thought my suitcase was big, then weighed it, and also found my bagpack too big. They never showed me the number shown on the weight scale, or informed me about why my bagpack was considered too big. Instead, they were rude. After me insisting on knowing how many kilos my suitcase was, they told me it was 9 kilos (instead of 8! ), for which I had to pay 50 euros more. I feel that economy class passengers are treated with no respect in the airport, and Aegean attempts to take more money from them, making their life difficult in their airport. I would not recommend flying with Aegean. A sandwich and a cup of coffee on the airplane is not worthy of such bad customer service.

### "great flight and highly recommended"
Not Verified |  Smooth check- in procedure at a very busy Athens Airport. Polite and efficient staff on hand to assist. Boarded a clean and shiny A321 Neo, greeted by smiling and courteous crew. Full flight, on time departure, usual high standard of onboard service. Good and clear PA announcements from cockpit in perfect English. Toilets were very clean. Landed early, bags arrived on belt without any issue. Thanks Aegean, great flight and highly recommended.

### "Lost my luggage 3 days ago"
Lost my luggage 3 days ago, no call from Aegean or airport. Holiday ruined. We had to re-buy all our clothes again as they made us check in even our cabin luggage.

### "Gold Air cannot be reached"
Lost my bag, no support or help from Aegean, trying to blame Gold Air. Gold Air cannot be reached either by phone or email. Aegean refuses to change return ticket to fly back to Crete early, only with extra charge can this be done. This trip is a complete waste of time. Food / Snack served on the 45 min flight a drink and Pringles.

### "inappropriate delay of the flight"
After an extremely inappropriate delay of the flight, the boarding procedure was unbearably slowly conducted by the airline employees. Extensive waiting for the bus transport from gate to the aircraft and then 20 minutes of waiting in the aircraft for no reason .

### "we still have no luggage"
Worst experience I’ve ever had flying. Lost bags on the flight from Athens to Rome. It’s been about a week now and we still have no luggage. It’s cost us money, time and stress and Aegean don’t reply to emails or answer phones to update us.

### "Professional service on-board"
Not Verified |  Athens Airport was extremely busy when I arrived. Proceeded to the Aegean Airlines check-in area which was manned by helpful staff and carried out self check-in. Met by polite staff at bag drop. Queues were starting to form at some counters, the one next to me was being held up by some irritating passengers who were questioning the baggage allowance for hand luggage. The Aegean website clearly states the weight permitted as do the various signs at check-in, yet some people pay no attention to this and continue to be rude and aggressive to check-in staff who are only doing their job, politely and professionally. Boarded on time, full flight. Politely greeted at door by cabin crew. Professional service on-board. Landed early. Clear announcements from cockpit. Great flight. Recommended.

### "hand luggage to be checked in"
Just flew in from Istanbul to Athens on the way to London. The first leg was fine, however this review is about flight A3608 on July 8th 2022 from Athens to London. It seems to have become a habit by airlines to force hand luggage to be checked in which is an annoyance for anyone who is familiar with the wait this results in at Heathrow. The crew are nice and friendly and apart from a minor delay, the flight was on time. I specifically asked for a window seat and was placed in position 28A. It’s only when I got on that I realized this seat is on the emergency door and this aircraft type does not support a window on this position.

### "extra hand luggage I had to pay"
To include an extra hand luggage I had to pay +20% on the fare. Checking in I weighed my luggage, it was 1.2kg above. I was forced to give it to the hold and not allowed to remove a jumper from my luggage to my backpack. A checked in luggage would have been cheaper than the upgrade I paid for. This is my worst travel experience in 2022.

### "I was allowed 8kg"
For two extra kilos you made me pay 40e. ‌I was flying Aegean Air from Thessaloniki to Athens today (flight A3 111) with economy/light ticket, which includes only one cabin bag of 8kilos. I did forget about this, and came to the airport with my cabin bag and a laptop backpack. After weighting my cabin bag, Aegean stuff said it was 10 kilos, I was allowed 8kg and only one luggage. I said I can put the backpack in the cabin bag, but they refused as this would make it heavier. They clearly didn't want to help me and actually told to to hurry up and pay the fine or I would miss the flight, as people were boarding. I later thought that I could have easily taken out my heavy jacket and trainers - I was wearing flip flops, and make my cabin bag much lighter, so with my laptop it would be a bit over 8 kilos. Very, very disappointing Aegean Air.

### "Politely greeted at door"
Not Verified |  Aegean check-in at Istanbul Airport are the only desks with approachable staff who serve you with a smile. This airport is too big and very impersonal. Expensive Duty Free Shops and eateries Boarded on time, nice, clean aircraft. Politely greeted at door. Slightly delayed departure, short flight, only 50 minutes, drinks and snack served by professional crew. Landed on time. No issues.

### "Aegean lost my bag 7 days ago"
Not Verified |  Aegean lost my bag 7 days ago and it is impossible to contact them. The world tracer is not updated and while they are supposed to contact me after 5 days there is no contact. The bag is an expensive piece of sports equipment and I have no idea if I will see it again. I waited over 50 minutes on their central baggage phone number without answer. I emailed them numerous times and no reply.

### "Service was good and attentive as always with this airline"
Early morning flight due to flight schedule changes (three months in advance notice). Flight JMK-ATH left early and arrived nearly 20 minutes ahead of schedule in Athens. Despite a nearly 2 hour connection, one of our priority tagged bags did not make it (together with 30 other bags) on the flight from ATH to CPH. It is quite impressive that Gold Air handling missed a whole trolley of bags. Flight to CPH was fine. Good service and quite nice new seats in Business Class (empty middle seat). Breakfast OK, not fantastic. Service was good and attentive as always with this airline. Bag trouble took 1 hour to register in CPH. Friendly service but took a while. One of our bags arrived on the wrong bag belt after us asking where it was. The other bag was left in Athens. Bag arrived following day late at night on a strange bag delivery service as I had to come down to the delivery truck and visually point at my bag. Strange and not very professional. Bottom line, poor to lose a priority bag in a two hour connection. And, by the way, I do not like the way this airline randomly pick on economy people to weigh their bags. In my opinion is either all or none. Not some poor people who has to face a huge cost because of one kg overweight hand luggage. What is really the point of upsetting people. The airline should know that if they write max 5kg hand luggage people will bring 10, if they write 8, they will bring 12. Build this in to the business model!

### "checked-in luggage has been lost"
Not Verified |  Horrible. Flight delayed more than 1 hour. After luckily making my connection right on time, upon arriving I find that my checked-in luggage has been lost. I filed a complaint, they said my luggage would be delivered to me in 1 or 2 days. Two days have passed and I have not received any feedback. My address for delivery in their website is incorrect (I chose to send to my temporary address, but they are showing that they are sending to my permanent address, which is in another country). Their websites are broken so you cannot update any information successfully. I called multiple times, one call took more than 35 minutes and nothing was resolved. Other calls I have waited for 20 minutes and then the call was dropped without having the chance to talk to anyone.

### "exemplary customer service"
Not Verified |  My employer was stuck for 2 1/2 hours in the Toronto Pearson Airport because of a delayed Air Canada flight headed to Athens, Greece last evening (June 16th, 2022) due to understaffing of airport personnel and consequently would miss his Athens (Aegean Airlines) connection to Mykonos on the other end. I call Aegean's customer service in Athens and spoke with a lovely gentleman, Avgoustis. Avgoustis was calm, reassuring, patient and found me the best possible solution to get my employer on a connecting flight to his final destination (Mykonos) in the shortest time possible. He kept me calm! I really hope that someone will recognize this gentlemen's exemplary customer service.

### "very rude, no negotiating and very aggressive"
Flight from Athens to Mykonos was great, every part. Our flight from Santorini to Athens - not so good. The agent working at check-in at the Santorini airport was rude, angry and classless. We had only a carry on that we checked once at Athens. We didn't buy anything and actually left our beach towels at the hotel. Upon checking in we were told that one of our carry on luggage was 2 kilos overweight and the other carry on was a half kilo over weight. We tried to explain those original luggage did not incur any problems before. We were charged an extra 50 euros. The way she said it was very rude, no negotiating and very aggressive. I guess this is how they treat you when you are trapped on an island. Definitely recommend the ferry or another airline.

### "Due personal reasons, we can't fly to Greece"
We booked our flights for December 2021. As covid hit harder, we decided to plan for another month, so we changed our flights for May 2022. Due personal reasons, we can't fly to Greece. I contacted the customer service several times, waiting in the line over 15 minutes, 15 minutes which I need to pay, the second call they told me they cannot help as I booked the flight somewhere else. So I contacted the initial website and got the information, they do not have the booking, as I changed the date on the airline website. Long story short, we lost 400€. I would really recommend to book at bigger airlines, at least you will get help if needed. So disappointing!

### "Excellent service by the cabin crew"
Excellent service by the cabin crew and the ground crew. They went1 beyond their responsibilities and helped me do the check in for another flight to EU country and communicate with another airport. They are kind and truly helpful! I have been using their service for several years now and I never had a negative experience with them.

### "my first choice to and from Greece"
Not Verified |  Had to reschedule my flight to Athens from London. Called the Aegean Customer Service line to do this. Lines were busy but didn't wait long. Call answered by very polite agent. I explained my situation about requiring my flight to be rescheduled and my onward connection within Greece. Agent did this and explained the process in excellent English. I paid the extra and booking was complete, no fuss, no bother. Flight was outstanding from start to finish, as usual. These are difficult times for everyone and we need a degree of flexibility. I am still shocked to see how rude and aggressive some passengers are to airline staff when travelling . Aegean is still my first choice to and from Greece, no airline is perfect but they are better than most.

### "They have lost 2 very good clients"
I just wanted to share my terrible experience (and it is the same for a lot of people!) with Aegean Airlines! In my case, after booking a flight to Athens, they first cancelled my flight and, instead of reimbursing the ticket, they offered me a voucher. I've reluctantly accepted, considering that my girlfriend and I go very often to Greece because we love it and we have dear friends there. The voucher, due to the Covid emergency still not allowing us to use it, expired. When I asked a reimbursement, as per point 9 of their Terms & Conditions policy, they have deliberately ignored all the emails I have sent. They have lost 2 very good clients, considering that we had always flown with Aegean and that we keep going to Greece as often as we can. Now I will rather swim to Greece, than using Aegean again! Worst airline ever!

### "flexibility is not part of business"
Couple hours after purchase through Expedia I realized I had the date one day earlier than what I planned. Called to find a solution. Originally I did not want to cancel the flight, only needed to change it. Aegean policies have no flexibility for the regular changes which would happen. It does not seem Aegean shows any interest in offering a useful service to customers but only have the customer stuck with a charge which they receive no services for because flexibility is not part of business. Aegean's website claims to have 24/7 customer service - I have been on the phone waiting for a rep for about 30 minutes and no answer to the extended that phone was automatically disconnected.

### "space cannot be considered acceptable for business class"
The space for legs cannot be considered acceptable for business class, with my height 1.90 cm I cannot fit my knees straight. It is beyond my understanding why Aegean presenting it as business class.

### "The complaints process was long and difficult to use"
Not Verified |  I bought tickets for flights and hotel however, when I needed to cancel in good time the airline refused to refund me. The level of English was broken at best and there was no attempt on the part of the airline to understand and rectify the issue. The complaints process was long and difficult to use. I tried to use the discount voucher codes for Covid-19 tests that the Aegean website was offering however, there were issues with using the codes so there was no way of using discount. In an attempt to escalate the issue I used the service Resolver, which is normally used as a last resort but this wasn't helpful as the airline simply did not engage in any way.

### "only middle seats were available for free"
I booked a ComfortFlex ticket for a midday flight from Athens to Thessaloniki on April 3rd. We had a change in our plans and I had to change my ticket to an evening flight. This particular fare allows changes for the same day with no fee and seats were available on the new flight so I logged into my reservation and changed the flight successfully. I then tried to reserve a window seat on the new flight but noticed that only middle seats were available for free. This seemed strange since the flight was not sold out and ComfortFlex tickets allow free seating in the entire aircraft except for the exit row seats, where a charge applies. I then noticed that the only window or aisle seats available on my new flight were those at the exit row and those would involve an extra 9 Euro charge. As I'm about to proceed with the payment of this 9 Euro charge, my boyfriend informs me he will be joining me on the same flight. We book a new ticket for him and when we reach the seat map on his reservation, we can see plenty window and aisle seats available for free. We decide to call the Aegean call center to inquire why our reservations show different seats maps even though we've both purchased ComfortFlex tickets and we're traveling on the same flight. Their response was that it must be a systemic error and if we wanted, we could wait until going to the airport and request a window or an aisle seat there. If anyone of you has ever called Aegean for similar matters, you'll know that 9 out of 10 times, it's always the "system". It's evident that they're manipulating the availability of their seat maps to force you to pay extra fees even when you've purchased their highest economy class fare. We paid the 9 Euro fee this time but from our main choice, they will become our last choice until they get their act together. And of course it came as no surprise to read so many other reviews here from other passengers complaining about similar situations. I'm attaching a picture of the two seat maps and I leave you to draw your own conclusions. The bookable seats are those in blue and in my seatmap, window and aisle seats are not available.

### "Excellent service from start to finish"
Not Verified |  Check-in procedure carried out professionally by extremely polite and communicative staff. Hand luggage was checked to ensure compliance with Aegean 's terms and conditions which it did. Breezed through Passport control despite the terminal being quite busy. Ample and polite staff kept queues short. Aegean Airlines terminal was spotlessly clean with ample duty free shopping available. Amazing authentic Greek food products like Greek baklava, feta and extra virgin olive oils were on promotion. Had to buy some. Boarding was orderly and we were greeted at aircraft door by immaculately dressed cabin crew. I am always impressed by how professional Aegean Airlines cabin crew are. They put Turkish Airlines crews to shame. On time departure with on board service of drinks and meal again served in a very professional and polite manner with a smile. Duty free trolley appeared after the meal service. Smooth flight, landed 20 minutes early. Excellent service from start to finish. Thoroughly recommended.

### "it is clear that they are in a steep decline"
Both me and my wife are frequent business travelers and Gold Miles & Bonus members. Aegean Airlines started off as a promising, refreshing presence in the Greek market but it is clear that they are in a steep decline. We've experienced such poor customer service in the last several years on a number of occasions. Refunds that took 18 months and countless calls and e-mails to process (for flights that Aegean Airlines canceled). Missed connections due to flight delays where they failed to assist us to reach our destination or arrange overnight accommodation for us. We were asked to cover the expenses on our own and then submit the receipts to receive compensation. We've taken trips where we were asked to pay service fees to change Comfort Flex and Business Class tickets. These two categories are their most unrestrictive fares and allow same day changes without a penalty, yet on a number of occasions, when their website failed to successfully change our tickets, we were asked to pay a service fee to proceed with the change. I could go on and on with a number of other disappointing practices but all in all, it seems that they've adopted policies and restrictions that we only find present with the so called low-cost carriers. All while charging full service carrier regular fares. Until they re-adjust their policies to a more customer service oriented level, we will certainly avoid flying with them in the future. Enough is enough.

### "friendly and professional staff"
I was traveling to Stockholm, always with Aegean which for me is the top airline in Europe. It is not only service, the friendly and professional staff but also, one of the few airlines that offer meals included in the ticket price. And the meals are really great. In this flight a big surprise was the desert offered on the menu of the flight, Greeks call it "pasteli" which is a traditional sweet with honey and sesame seeds. The one of the flight, Navarino Icons Pasteli, was exceptional!!! It was so tasty, fresh and I was surprised that looking for the brand I discovered that it is a product of Costa Navarino which is a luxury sustainable destination and resorts and the opposite of an industrial product.

### "Good trip, recommended"
Not Verified |  LHR - ATH. Check-in was polite, professional and quick. Great selection of Duty-free shops and eateries in T2. Boarding was orderly and greeted at aircraft door by polite and immaculately dressed cabin crew. On time departure, clean aircraft inside and outside. Seats are comfortable with adequate legroom. Drinks service and snack served. Attentive crew. Toilets at rear of plane in Economy were clean. Smooth flight, landed early. Good trip, recommended.

### "overall experience is very pleasant"
Not Verified |  Staff are friendly and the overall experience from ground and cabin crew is very pleasant. Families were given priority when flying from Athens and luggage is usually checked in at no cost (if within size/weight limit). Seats are fairly tight, as expected, but overall pretty comfortable. Planes are new with USB charging on board and if you are lucky, a basic on-board wi-fi streaming service. Food quality is really bad, a tiny cold sandwich, served in a very environmentally-unfriendly card box. Drinks choice is OK. The part that lets this airline down is cleanliness. I expect a spotless cabin, only to find carpets are dirty, which is surprising for a brand new plane, seats have no headrest cover and toilets the worst I have ever seen on a plane.

### "No warm food was offered"
Boarding was done with bus to remote location. Cabin staff were just professional but not friendly. In flight service (breakfast) was in a cardboard box consisting of a cream and a sweet in plastic. There was a option of sandwiches, but they ran out. With the high priced ticket a shame to provide such inflight service. No warm food was offered. The flight was on time. IFE was done through your mobile telephone and there was very limited viewing options.

### "bags would be above the 8 kilos allowed"
My wife and I booked a trip on Expedia. The rate for economy class seemed acceptable although it restricted us to a single carry-on of no more than 8 kilos. At the airport duty free we bought some items and when tried to board we were told that we had to pay 60 extra euros for the duty free bag. When we tried to put the contents into our carry-on they told us that we would still have to pay the 60 euros since our bags would be above the 8 kilos allowed. In the end we had to pay or lose our flight.

### "Best value for money"
Aegean Airlines are the best airline in Europe. They keep on doing an amazing job. Website and application are very easy to access, cabin crew are professional. New aircrafts and clean cabin. Best value for money.

### "It was very stressful and inconvenient"
I had to change flights in Athens. We were landing at 15.30 and my boarding time to the other flight was at 15.30! I asked if someone would take us to the other gate and they told me there would be a "transit ambassador". I started looking but no ambassador. They were sending me for PLF control which I already had in Prague and no one knew where was this ambassador. I had to pass again from security control. It was very stressful and inconvenient.

### "some things are really frustrating"
I dislike the fact that on too many arrivals this airline has not approached passenger walkways, and is choosing the bus as if we are still in the 50s. This was the case on our flight from Larnaca to Athens on 10/11 arriving with more than an hour delay, which was not announced until we were on board, and in Athens the bus like sardines despite the pandemic. The very expensive fare is not justified by a tiny sandwich they give you in flight, and you are given a choice of a fee seat only at the two last rows right next to the toilet, that is is such a place they give you 6 only free seats. You pay very dearly for the ticket, pay extra for luggage or anything over 8 kg, pay extra for a seat or take the seat next to the toilet. The plane is perfect, inflight service excellent, pilots top class, yet some things are really frustrating.

### "faced to pay my seat change"
I was unable to check in for some reason and I was given a seat in the middle. I tried to change it but after check-in at Oslo for the SAS flight, check-in kiosk couldn’t change it so I called Aegean. After 3 calls to the customer service line I was instructed it is fixed and I should check-in on the app paying for my seat change. At boarding in Stockholm I was faced to pay my seat change.

### "pay 100 pounds for our backpacks"
My daughter and I flew from London to Athens yesterday. We both had a backpack for our laptops, which we went to London with from Athens, but on the way back we have to pay 100 pounds for our backpacks. I am very upset and the rude Heathrow staff behavior with customers at the gate, and I will never recommend this airline.

### "The biggest letdown are the seats"
On this trip they used a A320neo which is noticeably quieter then the regular one. The all female cabin staff was acting friendly and efficiently. We received a lunchbox consisting of a sandwich and a tasty honey-sesame cookie. A limited range of drinks was served as well. They use the airfi on-board WiFi system for games, news, real-time map etc. The biggest letdown are the seats, with an incredibly tight pitch. Even the ones at Wizz Air have more legroom.

### "Nothing to complain about"
Nothing to complain about. Stuttgart to Heraklion/Crete on Sept. 21st and return on Oct. 1st. We booked Aegean for the convenient flight times and their decent luggage policy in the Eco ComfortFlex Fare. Both flights were 100% on time. Check-in procedures were quick and efficient. Due to the chaotic conditions at Heraklion Airport Aegeans punctuality and efficiency cannot be appreciated enough. Flight was ok. The crew was not overly motivated but helpful and friendly. There was a free snack and beverage service, which was nothing special but more than other airlines offer. Interior of plane was a little run down but seat comfort and leg space were ok. Overall the Eco Comfort Flex Fare is a very good value for money. Too bad, Aegean doesn't offer a Business Class on their HER flights, at least not out of STR.

### "They canceled my flight"
They canceled my flight and did not notify me. I had to look the flight up myself to find out. Then they would only refund with a voucher that they won't send for 2 weeks and that expires in 12 months. So I will have already left Europe by the time I get it and will probably never be able to use it. I couldn't find a new flight within the same day because it was such short notice which screwed up plans for accommodation that I can't get refunded and so on. The stress and money they have cost me is crazy.

### "Aegean did not use to be like that"
Accurate departure and arrival, Excellent check in process via the mobile app, clean plane. The new baggage policy has turned Aegean into what i would consider a low-cost carrier. Booking a Flex ticket in order to carry your luggage along with a laptop bag or a purse onboard is unacceptable. Aegean did not use to be like that. It was always a bit more expensive but the passenger was treated well, with good cabin service and with the ability to have a carry-on and a personal item onboard without having to pay anything extra.

### "I was 2 kilos over the limit"
My daughter bought this one way flight for me and paid Euro 140 with just cabin luggage. The ground staff representative asked me to change my flight to a flight that was leaving 7 hours later, without any consideration about the amount of money we had spent on this flight or what I was going to be doing for 7 hours at Corfu airport. My daughter had bought me this flight which was two times more expensive than the later one as I do not like to return home when it is dark. When I declined to change, she asked to weigh my cabin luggage. She then told me I was 2 kilos over the limit and I start unpacking my case, otherwise I would have to pay another Euro 35. I eventually left the check in area with my clothes over my arms and eventually repacked my case. While boarding, the same lady reprimanded me because I had repacked my case. Low cost airlines offer better service and much better value for money.

### "had to pay for that 60 euros"
My wife had a very small hand bag, we had to pay for that 60 euros, so I gave the lady cash, and she answered that they don t accept cash, so i told her what if i don’t have a credit card! She answered me, Sir you can complain at Aegean airline or airport in a rude way. When we arrived to our destination, they broke our luggage.

### "45 mins connection window "
Zero arrangements for connection flights. My Aegean flight came 30 mins late and I only had a 45 mins connection window to catch my flight to Thessaloniki with Olympic Air. No one made sure they waited for us, the boarding gate was across the airport so I was running for 15 mins. Had all my papers, covid pass and PFL checked before departure, yet they checked passports with another security check in control despite not leaving the airport. At the end my hand luggage was taken at the plane baggage section because there was no space upstairs. Think about connection flights!

### "now all they have is a snack"
I think the theoretical boarding procedures they have in place for covid are really good. Fill the plane from back to front and avoid too many people being on top of each other. The problem is that they do not to execute the boarding procedures the way they say they will and that leads to a lot of confusion. They used to have in flight meals in Economy, now all they have is a snack. At the end of the flight they squeezed passengers onto a bus.

### "Efficient, friendly service"
Not Verified | Larnaca to London Heathrow via Athens. Efficient, friendly service. Check-in at Larnaca was efficient and quick and all docs were checked with professionalism. Bags tagged all the way to Heathrow and boarding passes were given for both flights. Perfect on-board service, as always, for both flights. Would highly recommend this airline and would definitely choose them as my first choice when booking even if this involves a transfer at Athens International Airport. We’ll done Aegean Airlines.

### "very pleased with the crew and the service"
Not Verified |  I am travelling with Aegean Airlines every year from London to Greece and me with my kids are having great time on the flight. We recently came back from Athens Greece on 01.09 and we are very pleased with the crew and the service. I am missing the before COVID-19 period meals but the new kolatsio version is very good quality and tasty. I have been a member of Aegean Airlines for a long time now and even though I have tried Easyjet and Ryanair I won't change Aegean Airlines with anything.

### "very good in-flight service"
Aircraft new and clean. Seating is awful. Baggage policy on a "Light" fare is cheap like low cost. Fair in-flight food, very good in-flight service.

### "Online check in was great"
First flight was good and made me think it's an overlooked airline. Return flight made me think this is my last time with you. Online check in was great, clear options for upgrade, luggage etc. Clear communication (gate, gate opens etc.) although a long wait with less clarity before boarding. As I approached the gate B5 a lady with was checking all passengers passports, tickets and vaccination certificates or PCR tests. I was not sure about what was going on so I tried to listen to her conversations to prepare the necessary documents. Brief checks for everyone. I handed my ticket, passport and showed my vaccination certificate. Then she asked me to recite some information on my passport verifying the accuracy. Name, date of birth, place of birth and I was asked to pull down my mask. Then came the last step before boarding. Quick look at my documents. Do you speak French Sir"? How can you ask me that when you hold my French passport in your hands that states my place of birth? He then handed the passport to some security person who was  glancing through the pages with a confused face.

### "Smooth flight, landed on time"
Not Verified |  Check in area at T2 busy but well managed . Passengers ahead of me were holding up the queue, arguing about having to pay extra for hand luggage. The Aegean website clearly states the hand luggage allowance for the 3 types of ticket and this is clearly displayed at check-in . Some people are selfish and want an overhead bin all to themselves in the cabin. The passengers ahead of me had to pay extra as they had much more hand luggage than their free allowance. The check-in lady was polite but firm, good job. Boarding was efficient, on time departure. Bottled water and snack served, polite cabin crew. Smooth flight, landed on time. Suitcase arrived undamaged.

### "€40 to board a hand luggage"
The luggage fee in economy class is ridiculous: €40 to board a hand luggage, and the option is not advertised when purchasing the ticket. Sad that another flagship carrier turned economy airline. I won’t fly with them again.

### "had to pay extra 50 euros"
Absolutely disgusting behaviour by the staff whilst going to board our plane in Venice. We were rushed to show our boarding passes and Vaccination forms and other forms in paper form or on our phones, The check-in staff weigh ours and everyone's luggage. Our luggage was 7.8kg, but because I had a very small bag inside which was the only thing that would fit inside it, containing just my wallet, glasses, we had to pay extra 50 euros. They said that we had to take only one thing on board with an Economy Light ticket. Which was strange as when we initially booked our tickets we boarded our plane to Venice with the same things. My husband was told that if he did not pay 50 euros to put his hand cabin luggage then we were not allowed on the plane. Lots of passengers had connecting flights and missed them as the flight was late leaving because of all this mess before boarding the plane. It was a complete nightmare, The police came and tried to calm the situation. The Italian checkin staff did not have a clue how to speak properly to the passengers who were upset and stressed about the whole situation. Me and my husband will not ever fly with Aegean again.

### "crew was very kind and friendly"
The flight was amazing and the crew was very kind and friendly. The cabin was clean and spacious. It was a short flight so only a bottle of water was offered. Embarking and disembarking was coordinated really well to avoid crowding and spread of COVID-19.

### "had to use a stair by the jetway"
I have not been flying Aegean for more than 3 years apart from domestic flights where delays are a problem, but the same applied to my international flights in June. Seat not designed for you if you are taller than 1.85m. The flight from London to Athens landed and docked at the Schengen area, so passengers had to use a stair by the jetway and walk down to the tarmac, to get ferried by bus to the non-Schengen area of the airport. A complete mess as opposed to BA flights I always choose due to punctuality and smooth, consistent experience.

### "Thoroughly recommended"
Not Verified |  Last minute trip to Athens with Aegean. Check in procedure was a breeze. All Covid compliance checks ok. Boarding was quick, polite , mask wearing crew greeting passengers. Snack served on smooth flight. Landed early, good announcements from cockpit. Nice service from cabin crew. Cleared immigration quickly in Athens. Suitcases arrived on belt undamaged. Great trip. Thoroughly recommended.

### "Absolutely terrible"
Not Verified |  Absolutely terrible. Flight cancelled same night tickets bought and refund request takes weeks to complete. Then receive an email saying my refund request has been cancelled as I have applied for a credit voucher even though I haven’t? Do not recommend.

### "A superb flight"
Not Verified |  Aegean check-in was busy but agents were polite, professional and not stressed. Passport control and Covid checks were handled well. Great selection of duty free at Athens Airport. Boarding was efficient and welcomed by mask wearing crew. Clean, new A320 NEO inside and outside. On time departure, clear announcements from the cockpit. Smooth flight, snack served. Crew carried out cabin checks for mask compliance with courtesy. Landed early. A superb flight from a wonderful crew and great airline. Well done Aegean in these difficult times. Thoroughly recommended.

### "this is unacceptable!"
Not Verified |  Worst flight I’ve ever been on, the service was terrible and there was no air conditioning in the cabin. The cabin was very hot and the crew did nothing about it! In addition to all this the airline had a 1.5 hour delay for no obvious reason, this is unacceptable!

### "experienced two flight time changes"
I have been travelling with Aegean for years while I am a golden member on the Miles and More program. Since the beginning of the pandemic the Aegean customer service and operation standards has dramatically deteriorated. I recently travelled to Greece from Manchester and experienced two flight time changes from Aegean. My original flight schedule had a departure time at midnight from Manchester arriving at Athens Airport 6am local time with a connection flight at 7am to Thessaloniki. Two weeks after I booked the ticket Aegean changed the departure time for the Athens-Thessaloniki flight to 10am. I accepted the reschedule taking into account the accumulated tiredness from the overnight flight. A week before the departure Aegean decided to flight schedule from midnight to 20.30 arriving in Athens at 02.30 in morning, resulting overall on an 8 hours transit overnight at Athens airport. I found this inconsiderate and disrespectful to their customer. Apparently this is the way Aegean has been operating all their flights from Manchester since the beginning of June 2021 however they do not correct the flight times so to be aware prior to booking what is the accurate travel schedule. It is very sneaky, disrespectful and an immoral attitude to let passengers struggle with the unpredictable flight times. Still today nothing has changed on their booking system to correct the flight times

### "Aegean Airlines changed our flight"
Aegean Airlines changed our flight from ATH to MUC from an afternoon flight to an early morning flight even though we had only one day in Athens because (they said) “codeshare partner Lufthansa cancelled the afternoon flight.” After checking schedules and calling Lufthansa, we learned the flight is still operating, and the Lufthansa rep suggested Aegean is probably trying to fill their own aircraft. Very misleading.

### "my luggage was damaged"
Check-in at Heathrow took 30' and economy class was moving much quicker. No lounges at Heathrow was open (I guess due to covid) but it would be nice to be informed beforehand and not at check-in. ( maybe when purchasing the ticket?) Boarding was not done in any particular order but all passengers at once. 4) Just after boarding was completed one of the ground crew came into the business section and informed us that they were two meals short and two business passengers were not going to have a meal. In Business class and with no lounges at the airport. When arrived in my final destination (SKG) my luggage was damaged. When complained I was told that if the suitcase was ruined I was able to request a repair/new one. The next day I raised all these issues with Aegean and they said there was a mistake with the meal and I was given only excuses. Of course, mistakes happen but in my opinion, when a reputable airline makes any mistakes or mishandlings they should own their mistakes and offer redemptions.

### "Excellent flight, great crew. Very professional"
Not Verified |  Efficient and polite check-in, hassle free passport control and Covid compliance procedures. Attentive, welcoming cabin crew greeting all passengers upon boarding and all wearing masks. Informative announcements from cockpit pre departure. On time take off, box meal with water served and regular checks by cabin crew to ensure make compliance by passengers. Smooth flight with good selection of inflight entertainment and updates from cockpit. Landed early with understandable instructions from crew regarding arrivals and Covid procedures in hall. Bags appeared on belt within 20 minutes. Excellent flight, great crew. Very professional. Thoroughly recommended.

### "a problem in the flight"
Not Verified |  I flew several times in this year and each time there was a problem in the flight (late, canceled etc). The company was to give free tickets or credit vouchers but it is very difficult to use them (they're for limited seats and with no flexible dates even if the ticket had flexible dates).

### "I felt like I was fooled as a customer"
Not Verified |  I booked a ticket for the 2nd of June on the website, and it was mentioned that it was a flexible ticket (despite it was economy class) and it was mentioned the following: "All Flex, ComfortFlex and Business Class fares can be rebooked free of charge. Terms and Conditions Apply". One day before, I had to change the dates and they said that I had to pay 35 euros fee for reissuing the ticket because the price of the fare was slightly different (in fact the fare of the new date was lower) and they offered me to pay the difference of the price of the next more expensive fare. I could rebook free of charge only if the fare was the same (according to the terms and conditions)! I can understand that it is a difficult time for airlines but they have to be fair also with their customers. I almost always book economy and not refundable prices, so I am not familiar with the conditions of the flexible price in general, but I find it a very sneaky way to attract customers and reservations! How likely is it to find an exactly similar fare? Very small! So I don't see the point in calling it a flexible ticket! I am ok to pay for the change if I have to, but this time I felt like I was fooled as a customer! So for anyone who sees flexible tickets at Aegean and at any airline, read the terms and conditions very carefully, its a scam.

### "They didn’t reply to my emails and calls"
I don’t recommend this airline to you. Because of Coronavirus my flight was cancelled and I didn’t receive anything. They didn’t reply to my emails and calls. I am very disappointed and I will never fly with this airline anymore.

### "charged £38 for the second carry-on item"
I got charged £38 for the second carry-on item, a laptop bag because it was not thin enough although it  fits under the front seat as it's specified by the airline's baggage allowance. The person who checked in my bags (2x32kg + 1x23kg total 130£ for luggage) for my Flex booking tried to charge me more for my bags as he thought they were overweight until I showed him the baggage allowance for each bag. Then the agent acted surprised and oblivious about the weight limits. I contacted Aegean Airlines about this "misunderstanding" and they told me that they cannot do anything about it because the agent registered the reason for the charge as my cabin bag being overweight. Always have the luggage allowance description with you printed at the check-in as well, just to be sure you won't be overcharged.

### "find their behavior to be inexcusable"
Not Verified |  My opinion of Aegean comes from the difficulty we had canceling flights that we were scheduled to take in September 2020 because, as Americans, it was illegal for us even to be in the EU due to COVID-19 concerns. Aegean kept insisting that they'd only refund our taxes since our tickets were otherwise non - refundable, despite the special circumstances. They wanted us to produce information it was literally impossible to provide. Luckily, American Express stepped in and we received a full refund, but only over Aegean's every effort to keep it from happening. I've never been involved in such a ludicrous customer service circus, and find their behavior to be inexcusable.

### "great airline to travel with"
Not Verified |  Totally disagree with the previous review. I must congratulate Aegean with all their Covid procedures. Check-in was quick, efficient and polite. Boarding conducted in an orderly manner with All cabin crew wearing masks and ensuring that passengers complied with the strict measures with announcements on the PA system. Box meal provided with bottled water and regular checks by cabin crew to ensure mask wearing by passengers. Smooth flight, regular updates from cockpit. Landed early, hassle free arrival with reminders about compliance with Covid rules upon entry to Greece. Well done Aegean, great airline to travel with. A 4 star Covid safe carrier.

### "no Covid-19 measures"
Not Verified |  Extremely overpriced, rude staff, no Covid-19 measures for boarding and disembarkation and they are always looking for sneaky ways to charge you more. I wouldn’t recommend and will never travel with Aegean again.

### "I had very good experience"
I was disappointed many times by other airlines (wich I find ethical not to mention here) during these pandemic period. Surprisingly, I had very good experience with Aegean in every stage - from speaking to customer service to changing my ticket and getting alternative solutions to my problems. I what to thank the team with polite ladies on the phone and give you an excellent rating. Good luck!

### "Crew with a smile and calm"
Domestic flight in the early days of covid 19. Both flights half empty. Everyone wearing masks and applying sanitizer all the time. Crew with a smile and calm. Behind the smile, both crew and passengers were pretty nervous. Was considering to postpone my travel, but was unable to reach the call centre due to the overload and there was no option doing this online to an open ticket (this service later became available). I do not regret that I did travel though. Both flights on time. Used to mobile app for check-in and proceeded directly to the gate. All was ok.

### "vouchers that take ridiculously long time"
Aegean is getting clients to book flights that they proceed to cancel a few hours later. Instead of refunding the money, they either propose to transfer you to more expensive flights or issue vouchers that take ridiculously long time to be issued.

### "cabin baggage policy is very strict 8kg"
Very good airline however the new cabin baggage policy is very strict 8kg. Before boarding Aegean has scales and will weigh your cabin bag (they weighed nearly everyone on my flight), no duty-free is allowed extra it must be in your 8kg allowance and no hand bag or laptop bag is allowed. The only good thing is they were not strict with duty-free and I passed mine OK. The snack bag was excellent and had high quality foods inside. If the cabin baggage doesn't change I won't be booking with Aegean again, hopefully after covid this will change.

### "I don't know how this could get any worse"
Horrible customer service. Cancelled my ticket due to pandemic, moved to new dates without adding the seats and the baggage booked which was at an extra cost. For 3 days I have called without exaggeration over 50 times. No response on their phone numbers. I don't know how this could get any worse of an experience.

### "still waiting for my refund"
This flight was cancelled by Aegean and I am still waiting for my refund. Where is my money?

### "charged for excess 2kg of hand baggage"
Very disappointing, hand baggage is only one piece of 7 kg and no personal item. Aegean Airlines charged me 50 eur for an excess 2kg of hand baggage, totally unacceptable

### "professional and comfortable flight"
Not Verified |  Trouble - free and polite check in at Terminal 2. Boarded efficiently. On time departure. Polite and professional crew, greeted at door. Box meal during flight but understandable given Covid precautions. Crew ensured face coverings were worn. Landed early and swift collection of luggage. A very professional and comfortable flight. Well done Aegean.

### "Awful experience"
Not Verified |  Heraklion to Thessaloniki with Aegean Airlines. Awful experience, very rude crew and they charge extra for luggage while you only can have one luggage of 8 kilos without informing you about changes before the check in.

### "that is why I started yelling"
I was traveling to Bucharest, after checking in and going through the control area, I arrived at the gate that my flight was going to take place. 30 minutes before the flight, they announced that the boarding will start soon. Firstly, it was smooth no problems with anyone even though some people had more than 1 luggage, duty free bags. Towards the end of boarding and approximately 20 people were standing at the queue, a female came to check the last people's tickets to see what ticket they purchased. I have purchased the economy class ticket along with most of my fellows. That lady checked my ticket, and said only one bag is allowed in the plane looking at my other hand while I was holding an extra duty free bag with 2 bottle of spirit that I purchased. And she literally pointed that I had to shove into my bag 2 alcoholic spirits which it was really hard since my bag was smaller than the required size. I did manage to storeboth in my bag which I was really glad about it. When I reached the ticket check, the same lady stopped me and said "OK did u manage to fit everything in your luggage'' I replied "yes thank you" and she goes "ok let's check the weight". It's this moment that you realize the obvious. Yes the luggage was more than 8kg but what you expect after she is the one that told me fit everything in your bag so you can board the aircraft. So I was really angry at that moment and that is why I started yelling. What was the outcome?! I did manage to fit the 2 alcoholic spirits in my bag I had only one bag That bag was more that 8 kg obviously since I had to fit everything She initially said nothing can be done and after a while she changed her mind and charged that bag with an extra 50 euros.

### "Smiling and helpful crew"
6-month old Airbus A320 Neo. Aegean has opted for a very nice internal configuration on this brand new aircraft type but, strangely, without IFE & overhead screens for live flight tracking / map. Smiling and helpful crew. Poor mean served (a small sandwich, a small chocolate bar and a bottle of water). Full drinks service. At the moment, the Aegean lounge at Athens airport has a much better offering than the Lufthansa lounge. Would fly again.

### "excellent on every level"
I required assistance on flights from Edinburgh via Athens to Santorini, and on my return , I would like to thank all of your staff at every stage of my journey, they were excellent on every level and made my journey so easy and were pleasant and made me feel comfortable, thank you all so much

### "cabin crew could have been more strict"
Check-in in Dublin was handled by Swissport, the staff were friendly and efficient. The Swissport staff apologised that the lounge was not available (not sure if this was Covid-19 related or because the flight departs at 23.59), in any case Aegean should really make this clear at the time of booking. Fast Track security was also closed but it didn't matter as there was hardly anyone at security. Boarding was well managed. The cabin was modern and comfortable and USB ports were available at the seat. The Cabin Crew were charming and efficient. The on board service consisted of a bag containing a sandwich, a muffin, juice and water. There was also a bar service with alcoholic and soft drinks. I had pre-ordered a gluten free meal but all special meals have been suspended due to Covid-19. While I understand the need to simplify the service I think it should still be possible to provide special meals in a pre-packaged format like the standard meals. My only other observation is that the cabin crew could have been more strict enforcing face covering requirements where passengers were wearing these below the nose/mouth. Although I had booked a flexible business class fare there was still a substantial fare difference to change my return flight date.

### "refused me boarding"
I cannot speak for the flight itself but for the boarding experience at Malpensa Airport. Boarding staff were verbally aggressive towards me. I hadn't the PLF form to fly to Greece but managed to submit it while waiting fellow passengers boarding, the flight was due to arrive at 9 pm and I would receive the PLF at 0 am the next day so I could easily waited that time at Athens airport to present it to authorities, still the boarding gate lady, which spoke fluent Portuguese and was Portuguese, refused me boarding.

### "sandwich, a snack and a bottle of water"
The A320neo has 31 rows of seats which means the legroom is very tight. During e-check in they allocate you seat which you cannot change unless you pay at least €5. Inflight service was poor with a bag which contained a sandwich, a snack and a bottle of water. They do not serve alcohol due to covid-19. Announcements were on English and Greek.

### "do not allow a backpack and a cabin bag"
I had two calls with them on the 23rd and the 24th of July with regards to changing my flight. According to them, I could have one change without penalty with no extra charge due to Covid-19. However, because I needed to change airports, I had to pay the penalty. Whilst on my first call, the girl I talked to told me that I needed to pay 100euros for the change whereas the next day I was told to pay 140euros for the same change (Note: The flight rate didn't change at all). Despite the difference, I changed my flight ticket asking for a baggage too. They booked my ticket without adding a baggage! I called yesterday to ask what happened and they were telling me that there was no charge for the baggage. Then, they told me they would listen to my recording and call me back. They called me two hours later; the phone was ringing for 5 secs and I did not manage to pick it up. I called back and I was told that the girl who was assisting me finished her work for the day. The next person told me that would look into it but instead of putting me on hold, they hung up on me and never called back! I called again today, the assistant could not find the notes of the first person who listened to the recording and of course did not add my baggage for free. I did however requested both calls (the one asking for 100euros and the second one when they asked for more money and did not add my baggage); I am waiting for the response. On the 2nd of August, I flew from Athens to Heraklion. There was about a 2-hour delay and the airline offered us a free ticket. However, they state that I cannot use the free ticket during Christmas, Easter, July and August but as I live in the UK and I am not allowed to use it the only periods that I can travel to Greece. Due to Covid-19 they do not allow a backpack and a cabin bag on board. They do not allow to check-in the cabin bag. The price tickets are not cheaper either.

### "seat selection is not free"
Up until recently Aegean was one of the best carriers in Europe. This is not the case anymore as they are adopting more and more policies of a typical low cost airline. For the lowest fare category (go light), one item is now allowed in the cabin and seat selection is not free. Any extra item cannot be checked for free but customers need to pay a fee at the airport. I just hope this is a temporary measure due to Covid19.

### "kept taking their masks off"
Flying from Rhodes to Larnaca with my family during the Covid-19 pandemic with Aegean Airlines was not a nice experience. The passengers behind us kept taking their masks off and talking, and despite our numerous attempt to ask the staff to ask the passengers to keep their masks on they took it off. Even a steward talked to them for 15 minutes while it was off and still they did not care. We ended up having to keep it on for everyones safety and they just said relax.

### "could only bring one item on board"
Heraklion to Thessaloniki. They said that because of covid-19 we could only bring one item on board. People had to measure their luggage size and to pay 40 euros extra, while there was plenty of space on board. At the same time there were really no airport covid19 tests taking place. Also my seat was small for 75 mins flight.

### "totally recommend this airline"
Barcelona to Athens. I'll have to start with the fact that they let you have a checked in bag which weighs up to a certain amount of kilos for free, which as far as I'm concerned is not the case for many airlines. Flight was initially delayed by half an hour or so which for me wasn't a lot as I didn't have any connecting flights to worry about, but I understand that for some people this might not be the case. Boarding was done via jetbridge and was rather fast considering the flight was full. We boarded the plane, but didn't take off for nearly another two hours due to a thunderstorm over the airport. The seats were very comfortable for Economy class, but again I'm only 1.62 so my opinion on this probably isn't relevant. The pilots made an announcement straight away and the flight attendants handed out free drinks to everyone during the time we spent on the ground. The pilots kept informing us of the situation and when we finally took off the flight was extremely turbulent, but they handled the situation pretty well I must say. A free hot meal was provided for all passengers, both Bussiness and Economy class which is very rare these days for an intra-european flight. When we arrived in Athens the pilots made an apology for the delay and announced that every passenger who had missed their connecting flight would be offered either a free rebooking or a voucher but I can't remember exactly, as I didn't need one. Luggage came out quickly and it wasn't damaged in any way. The price was ok but considering their excellent service I can't even think about complaining about the price. The only thing that I didn't quite like was the fact that there was no in flight entertaining as there were no screens which having flown on their A320s as well I know are present there, but not in the A321, but again, I'm not complaining. Fantastic experience and I would totally recommend this airline.

### "aircraft was perfect"
Aegean is my favorite Greek Airline. In July 2019 I travelled from Munich to Athens. Aegean aircraft was perfect also seat was perfect. Landed on time at Athens Airport with smooth landing.

### "superior to most airlines"
Corfu to Athens in September 2019. Used Aegean several times. Definitely one of the best European airlines. Seat comfort, service, cleanliness, even food is superior to most airlines. Had an issue once when a ferry was cancelled and we couldn’t catch our flight. Aegean immediately exchanged our tickets at no extra cost.

### "really appreciate Aegean customer service"
It was the best air trip. Aegean Airlines occured a flight from Brussels to Athens without any cancellation in addition to other airlines. (During the period of covid 19). The crew was gentle and ready to make us feel comfortable. The second trip that i did from Athens to Rhodes surprised me a lot, as it occurred with three only passengers. Me and two other passengers, it makes me extremely impression. I really appreciate Aegean customer service and policy and i hope to make another air trip with this airline soon.

### "offered a credit voucher"
Not Verified |  Aegean canceled our flight on 30th March because it stopped all flights to Athens from 26th March onwards. They refused to refund us because our tickets were not refundable. We filed a complaint asking for a refund since it was the Airline that canceled the flight and not us. They offered a credit voucher that can be used within the next 18 months.

### "80 euros for excess baggage"
Not Verified |  Heraklion to Athens. I finally found a flight to get home to the UK during the Corona virus crisis, flying Aegean to Athens and then Swiss Air to the UK via Zurich. It was a difficult time and travelling was quite stressful given the situation. We travelled with hand luggage to avoid baggage claim. When my wife and I came to board in Heraklion the ground staff,  weighed our bags and asked for a credit card and charged us 80 euros for excess baggage. We would have expected more compassion. Swiss offered to put the bags in the hold for not cost and could not have been more sympathetic and accommodating during the crisis.

### "Thanks Aegean for a great job"
Not Verified |  Last minute trip to Athens with Aegean Airlines. Received text advising flight cancelation, was re-booked on evening flight without any additional charge. Helpful and sympathetic staff. Inflight service as polite and professional as always. Thanks Aegean for a great job in difficult circumstance. Other airlines, take note.

### "Simply unacceptable"
Not Verified | London to Athens. Aegean is anything but an airline! They simply should not exist! Business Class ticket and from London to Athens, the back of my seat was destroyed. While in Athens, they cancel the flight and then they ask me to pay more to rebook my flight! When I ask the agent to transfer the call to a supervisor, his response was “it is the airline’s policy not to allow the passenger to speak with supervisors”! Simply unacceptable! There is absolutely no reason for companies like this one to exist!

### "feel like someone stole my money"
I booked a flight from Athens to Thessaloniki return. They cancelled the flights and never gave back the refund of the amount and they suggested either rebooking (with the fare difference paid by me) or a credit voucher with limitations, valid for 12 months. I said to them I want a full refund of my ticket and I disagree with these 2 options as I am not obliged to fly with them next time. They said that their regulations changed because of COVID-19 and they don't refund. I feel like someone stole my money. I still wait for a refund because they violated the rules of the ticket issued. For sure, the airline's policy shows how they threat passengers both aboard and on the ground in any situation.

### "they don't solve this problem"
I bought and paid flex ticket Zurich to Corfu for late April, they cancelled the flight, no reimbursement, you have to phone to Athens but you never get through! No possibility by email, chat or online. They write that there are long waiting times for telephone connection but they don't solve this problem.

### "My bag was just over 9 kilos"
Heraklion to Athens. Ground staff were rude to me. My bag was just over 9 kilos and I had to pay 40 Euros on the spot for a 30 minute internal flight. I paid and I asked if I can now at least take my bag on board. (My bag was within the required dimensions. I was told no, I can't take it onboard because it is more than 8 kilos. Aegean has managed to build a great reputation over the last decades. Is it really worth damaging it for the sake of couple extra Euros which people pay when they are left with no choice? I will be avoiding Aegean wherever possible moving forward.

### "a pleasure to fly with it"
Athens to Frankfurt. The cabin crew are very welcoming and professional. This company offers a quality service clearly above the European average. It’s always a pleasure to fly with it.

### "an uncomfortable flight"
Athens to Zurich. A320 neo, space between the seats in economy class is a no-go. Never encountered such an uncomfortable flight. A320s don’t get much denser than that and that is what my knees felt. They also put in place reclining seats, so this nightmare even gets worse if the person in front reclines.

### "smiling and very professional"
Thessaloniki to Berlin via Athens. This was one of my best flights with Aegean. Second time to enjoy the service from a great purser. Always smiling and very professional. Perfect!

### "inflight entertainment was boring"
Not Verified |  Thessaloniki to Zurich via Athens with Aegean Airlines. Delayed departure due to technical problems and changing aircraft after boarding in Athens, from Zurich there was a delay due to delay of previous arrival due to strong winds. The inflight entertainment was boring. Crew were ok. All the meals were in a lot of plastic.

### "expecting much nicer service"
Thessaloniki to Munich with Aegean Airlines. Full flight and not enough space for the bag under the seat in front. Since the boarding ground staff are measuring the hand luggage that needs to be a max of 8kg. If the weight is more than 8kg people had to pay 50€ at the gate. Some crew on board seem like they had more fun talking between each other and forgetting to give us a second drink. I was expecting much nicer service regarding the beverages.

### "Enjoyable flight"
Not Verified |  Amsterdam to Athens. Enjoyable flight. Seamless check in at Schiphol Airport. Cabin immaculate, and crew well groomed. So nice to see air hostesses helping staff with storage in overhead lockers. Few European airlines still offer hot meals on flights throughout Europe. Moreover drinks and tea /coffee also all provided with no charge. No complaints. On arrival at Athens airport luggage came out swiftly. Well done Aegean!

### "Ground staff always rude"
Frankfurt to Athens. Ground staff in Athens always rude and this is the reason I’m writing this review! It’s a shame as they apparently did not realize that it’s all about customer experience when you are working in the services sector! The airline itself it’s quite decent - even though a lot of the times there are flight delays, unfortunately, and the staff on board are usually very nice and welcoming, which makes their ground colleagues appear even ruder! And it makes you wonder: doesn’t the company have certain policies or training about customer service for all their employees?

### "wasn't eligible for compensation"
I flew with Aegean Airlines from Prague to Athens. The ground service wasn't the best . My flight was during the Christmas period and the flight was almost full. There were long queues in front of the desk of the airline company and the assistants seemed unable to handle the big number of passengers. The experience on-board was overall good. Comparing to other airlines the meal and the beverages were better and the flight attendants were kind and with a helpful attitude. The seats weren't the most convenient ones though. I paid for an extra 23 kg luggage for my flight. I was supposed to get it, after my arrival in Athens, but for some reason my suitcase was left in Prague. I reported the incident to the company, which is responsible for the tracking and management of lost baggages and luckily they found and delivered it to me the next evening. In my suitcase there were clothing and stuff that I needed. So, I decided to contact the costumer service and request for a reimbursement. The answer I received was that I wasn't eligible for compensation, because my luggage was delivered within 24 hours.

### "professional and comfortable"
Not Verified |  Could not disagree more with two recent reviews. My trip Athens to London with Aegean was a very professional and comfortable experience. From easy and polite check-in at Athens International to the goodbye at the cabin door upon arrival by excellent cabin crew, the service is seamless. Seating is decent for a 3 and a half hour flight and they offer a full service of drinks and hot meals. Great vegetarian pasta. Aegean is far superior to other European carriers and I would choose Aegean any day. Thoroughly recommended.

### "feels like legroom has reduced"
Frankfurt to Athens. It might be my impression but it feels like the legroom has been reduced, seats are awful and  uncomfortable. The customer service is  average along with the cleanliness of the aircraft. As long as the flight is fully booked the land crew requests from clients to board with just the hand luggage and deliver the carry-on luggage to the hold (free of charge as they claim). This review was written with the value-for-money in mind as the primary factor. Hence there is no reason at all booking the tickets with Aegean if you are about to pay more and receive the same legroom and seat-comfort to any other low-cost flying company Since Aegean allows its passengers to fly in Economy/Go-Light with the standard carry-on luggage and handbag allowance (as stated on their ticket), they should adhere to that. The reason passengers do that is because it allows them to quickly grab their bags and catch the next flight without having to wait on the belt to retrieve luggage. I agree with the company's policy to weigh/measure the carry-on luggage prior to boarding in order to filter any passengers carrying excessive carry-ons. However as long as the passenger is compliant  they shouldn't force him/her deliver their carry-on to the hold. I am a Silver member over the past 3 years and during this flight I requested for my ticket to be upgraded. However the representative assured me that I wasn't able since the flight was in cooperation with Lufthansa. When I asked to upgrade only the ticket from Frankfurt to Athens (operated by Aegean) they declined providing me the same reason. Yet they didn't forget to email me a "Bid to Upgrade your Seat" email.

### "cramped on both flights"
Berlin to Thessaloniki via Athens. Not the best flight with Aegean. Cabin was old and the crew on both flights not very helpful and charming. As a gold member, I was cramped on both flights in full rows.

### "service is always perfect"
Athens to Kiev. Among the top European airlines. Price is always reasonable and service is always perfect. I never had any problem and I always choose when available.

### "Excellent as always"
Lisbon to Athens. One more time with Aegean! Excellent as always, on time, crew friendly and approachable, hot meal and drinks for free, clean aircraft. Don't know if you need more from an airline if you fly in Europe

### "ground staff showed no consideration"
We missed our connecting flight to Larnaca twice due to delays first of Lufthansa and then of Aegean. We ended up with a route of 4 flights from Hamburg to LCA with total trip duration of 24 hours. The ground staff of Aegean at the gate requested me to leave my carry-on baggage at the gate to be picked up at luggage claim at LCA as the plane was full. I kindly explained that I’m traveling with a companion who had his carryon with him and we had to get a taxi together immediately after arrival. The ground staff showed no consideration and insisted that it is the airlines regulation. She spoke rudely with a loud voice.

### "My food was an absolute disgrace"
Not Verified |  London to Athens. Check in, and lounge all went well. The staff on board not as professional as my last flight. My food in business class was an absolute disgrace, I have never been served this on any airline (beef stew and eggplant mash). Limited drinks and no black tea. I paid for business class but It was a waste of money.

### "again the bus"
Larnaca to Athens. I can understand that if plane arrives late at night, it can park away from the terminal, but in this case parking away and using the bus seems to be a common feature. On this flight arriving at 09.50 in the morning at a half empty airport at Athens and again the bus. Otherwise as an airline apart from higher costs, Aegean could be given top marks though passenger legroom was limited.

### "nice and welcoming air crew"
Athens to Tel Aviv with Aegean Airlines. Very nice and welcoming air crew helped all passengers to quickly find space and seats. I was supersized they served light dinner – Warm Pasta and biscuits and a variety of drinks. Seat are 3x3 and packed but for 2 hour flight its OK.

### "Excellent European airline"
Athens to London. Very pleasant flight by Aegean Airlines. One of the best airlines in Europe. It was a fully flight from Athens to LHR. Boarding was done efficiently. The crew are this airlines best asset and they are excellent. Friendly and approachable. A hot meal and 2 drink runs. Any request and the crew were obliging. What other airline in Europe would serve a hot meal in economy now days. Excellent European airline.

### "give them marks for being on time"
Not Verified |  Mykonos to Athens via Santorini. Prices for flights were reasonable. Carry on regulations are not enforced and you have some passengers showing up thinking the rules somehow don’t apply to them, with shopping bags, purses, oversized luggage etc. The experience with crowding, pushing and a race for the overhead luggage compartments. Boarding is a cattle call with no zones or row sequence. All this being said we took 5 flights in 14 days with this airline and I have to give them marks for being on time. Planes sparsely equipped but for 30-60 minute flights it really didn’t matter, nor did the awful snacks of Oreo like cookies, bad coffee and hard candy I think most passengers could have done without. Flight attendants were very presentable but definitely not overworked. Loading, deplaning, unnecessary crowded short bus rides and transfers at Athens airport will try your patience sometimes sending you through security twice for no reason. Pay the reasonable flight costs, close your eyes and just hope it ends as quickly as it can.

### "taken to the plane on the bus"
Athens to Vienna. Outbound the plane was so narrow seated that even myself of medium height could hardly move, food - the good old pasta as always, and though it was a midday flight at 14.40 we were taken to the plane on the bus. The flight was smooth, inflight staff the best asset of this airline, otherwise as good as any other airline though the use of passenger bridges is not within the programme of Aegean. Front rows 1- 12 you have to pay for them plus 25 euros for your check in luggage, 30 to London. No in flight entertainment.

### "the best airline in Europe"
Cairo to Prague via Athens, friendly staff (cabin crew, check in employees), great service, hot food served , clean aircraft. Not the first time with Aegean Airlines and they are always improving, keep up the great work. You deserve to be the best airline in Europe.

### "consistently good service"
Aegean Airlines has a consistently good service that ranges from customer service on the phone center to very friendly and welcoming cabin crew. The flight left on time, the airplane was spotlessly clean and pilot provided information several times. Food during flight was delicious. The only negative thing I can mention is the crowded lounge (which otherwise has a great choice of food and beverages) in the mornings when several Aegean airplanes are departing at the same time. In general, flying Aegean is always a pleasant experience for me with a good value for money.

### "great staff service"
Athens to Sofia. Excellent value for the money I paid (93 Canadian dollars). Seats were comfortable, airplane was clean, great staff service. This is the 3d time I take them. I flew with Aegean 3 years ago and once again they deliver and are worthy of their 4 star rating. I was not expecting food to be offered on this flight; make sure you make your meal request well in advance, otherwise there may not be anything vegetarian. (This was my fault). All I can say is that the food looked like it was good quality and they offer a reasonable selection of beverages.

### "Onboard service was really good"
Booked the flight from Palermo to Athens with Aegean. The flight was operated by Olympic Air, which I didn't mind. Boarding was efficient and we departed in time. The plane was a bit dated compared to the rest Aegean fleet. Onboard service was really good, with full service. Especially the two FAs, Eirini and Myrto, were really attentive, kind and reassuring. Always Aegean is my top choice for travel.

### "onboard bag is 1-2kg too heavy"
Athens to Munich. The ground staff in Athens is unpolite and rude, if the onboard bag is 1-2kg too heavy charging them 50€. Calling each passenger to their desk who didn't book any extra baggage. I'll never fly with this airline again. The food on board is really bad for me.

### "business class was impeccable"
Hamburg to Rhodes via Athens. Check-in was friendly and professional, also the boarding. The route HAM-ATH took place in Business Class, the onward flight to RHO in Economy. The service of business class was impeccable. There was a 3-course menu, the main course could be chosen from 2 courts. There were several wines to choose from, as well as soft drinks, beer, spirits, coffee, espresso, etc. Typically on European flights was the 3 seats, with the middle seat was free. The seats were comfortable, although a little tighter as the table is in the armrest. After the delayed landing in Athens, the business guests were taken to the terminal in a separate bus, so it was not a problem to get the connecting flight. The onward flight in economy class was fine. It was a snack and drink, the staff was friendly. DE: Check-in war freundlich und professionell, ebenfalls das Boarding. Die Strecke HAM-ATH erfolgte in der Business Class, der Weiterflug nach RHO in Economy. Der Service der Business Class war einwandfrei. Es gab ein 3 Gänge Menü, die Hauptspeise konnte aus 2 Gerichten gewählt werden. Dazu gab es mehrere Weine zur Auswahl, sowie Softdrinks, Bier, Spirituosen, Kaffee, Espresso, etc. Typisch auf Europaflügen war der 3er Bestuhlung, wobei der mittlere Sitz frei blieb. Die Sitze waren bequem, obwohl etwas enger, da der Tisch in der Armlehne untergebracht ist. Nach der verspäteten Landung in Athen wurden die Business Gäste in einem eigenen Bus zum Terminal gebracht, daher war es kein Problem den Anschlussflug zu bekommen. Der Weiterflug in der Economy Class war in Ordnung. Es wurde ein Snack und Getränk gereicht, das Personal war freundlich.

### "haven’t received my compensation"
I took this airline from Rome to Athens on July 30th and my checked in baggage was damaged. One of the wheels was missing and my suitcase was cracked. I went to the desk where they were handling this situation. I reported it and emailed them the day of the incident. I didn’t receive an email back until the end of August. One of their associates informed me that they can compensate for the damage and give me €80. I gave them my banking information, they said over and over again that she still needed an “Intermediary SWIFT code” as it is necessary for non-EU people. I went to my bank Chase, and they had never heard of that, so I called the wire transfer department at Chase and they informed me that the recipient should have the Intermediary SWIFT code. I already gave them the information they needed so now it’s their turn to transfer the amount. I still haven’t received my compensation from the airline.

### "nice staff and reasonable food."
Athens to Munich. Lounge in ATH was a disappointment. We expected a full breakfast for this early flight. Unfortunately only continental breakfast was provided. On board, everything fine. Clean aircraft, nice staff and reasonable food. A standard now on European routes, when flying Star alliance. Note for the excellent airshow.

### "Great service from the crew"
Not Verified |  ATH - LHR, 8 September 2019. Check in was a breeze at the very comfortable Athens International Airport. Polite and friendly Aegean staff on hand to assist with Self Check in counters. A smile and a sense of humour made the process easy and informative. No excess charges necessary for luggage. I really don't understand people who post reviews on here and bemoan the fact that they have to pay extra if their bags exceed the permitted baggage allowance. You will have to pay more regardless of airline so use your common sense and educate yourself about your permitted allowance. Boarding was undertaken in an orderly manner. Greeted at the aircraft door with a very warm welcome by immaculate looking cabin crew. Flawless hair and make up. Elegant and functional uniform. Departed with a 20 minute delay. Drink service commenced shortly after followed by a very tasty, hot and well presented vegetarian meal. One of the best I have experienced. Great service from the crew. Aegean is one of the few airlines in Europe that offers a full service on board and is to be congratulated. Landed 5 minutes ahead of schedule. Great flight, excellent crew. Shall definately be flying Aegean Airlines again. Good job.

### "most unfair airline"
London to Santorini via Athens. Aegean charges an exorbitant price for minimal weight excess. Be sure you will be charged £55 for an extra kilo. It is certainly the most unfair airline I've ever been. There were no prior email warning/reminders, which other airlines have the decency to do so. Ryanair hanks way higher on fairness and customer service. I can securely say that I'll never fly with Aegan again.

### "skipped my son when serving water"
Heraklion to Athens. First attendants skipped my son when serving water. When he asked attendant for water, she replied just a second and just went on serving other passengers. When I asked another flight attendant if we could get some water. She politely replied that was no problem and disappeared.

### "once again exceptional"
Flew with Aegean from Athens to Catania. The flight with Aegean was once again exceptional. Modern aircraft, very friendly and helpful crew, entertainment system (Aegean Stream). The FAs managed very good work despite the full cabin. The food was nice (sandwiches), yet I would like to have a hot meal on shorter intl routes, as most flights with Aegean. The only thing I can complain about is the boarding procedure. During both boarding in ATH and disembarkation in CTA we used buses, despite the fact that there were available jetbridges in Catania airport. Overall a very good flight, with value for money (108 EUROS during high season).

### "a disappointment in terms of comfort"
Athens to Zurich. Once again flying with Aegean was a disappointment in terms of comfort. The “free” seats do not have adequate room for an adult measuring more than 180cm. When seated one has to sit upright and yet the knees are hitting on the seat in front and the passenger can effectively not move. This was implemented by Aegean two years ago in order to save one extra row of seats on the plane as well as to increase its revenues from disappointed passengers who could not tolerate this discomfort and would pay for a set upgrade. Shame for a company that does not see itself (and not charges) as a low cost airline yet treats its economy passengers as such.

### "Very friendly cabin crew2
The flight was operated by Olympic Air, Q400. Plane was ok; both flights were 30 minutes late even though we were boarded plane on time. Service for the 1 hr 55 min flight was basic, sandwich and fruits, water, beer, wine. Very friendly cabin crew, especially on the flight ATH-SJJ were great because they offered to give me theirs lunch which was a fruit salad, because I had option of and they had only tuna sandwich, or ham & cheese sandwich.

### "arrival was 15' ahead of schedule"
Zakynthos to Athens, flight on Olympic Airline codes, operated by Aegean Airlines, on a very early morning. Flight was on time, embarkation and disembarkation was by bus, however easy and quick. Used e-check in, very simple and the boarding pass is sent by sms to the snartphone with a link. The app was not needed. Got seat 1A. Flight 70% full and arrival was 15' ahead of schedule. We were offered water/juice and a biscuit. Booked this ticket by redeeming points through the Aegean Miles & Bonus scheme, so it was very cheap.

### "an amazing experience"
Sofia to Beirut via Athens. Once again an amazing experience with this airline. Flights on time, hot meal (on 1h 20’ flight), comfortable seats, clean cabin, friendly and professional crew. This is why Aegean has been my first choice in recent years. I hope they keep up the good service they are offering and do not downgrade. Frankly, I can’t say anything bad. Love Aegean.

### "I paid and complained later"
Misleading information on Aegean website. Purchasing on-line a Economy GoLight ticket Santorini to Athens on Aegean website and being a Star Alliance Gold member, I estimated that I was entitled to 23 kg free checked baggage. I knew that some flights might be operated by Olympic Air. I based by understanding on the following assessments on Aegean website, when purchasing the ticket: A-"The number of bags, the charges and allowable dimensions may vary depending on your flight, the fare (GoLight, Flex & Business) and the Class (Economy or Business) in which you are travelling. That is why we advise you to check the specific baggage information either on the AEGEAN website or your booking before every flight.  B-"Miles+Bonus Gold* & Star Alliance Gold :3 pieces 32 kg in Business or 2 pieces 23kg in Economy Flex or 1 piece 23kg in Economy GoLight 158 cm (62 inches)" C-"Important notes regarding baggage: This baggage policy applies only on flights operated by AEGEAN and Olympic Air aircraft. However, when checking-in at airport, staff acknowledged by Star Alliance Gold status with priority tagging my sole luggage, BUT charged me US$35,00 (more than 50% of the cost to the ticket, and more than if I had purchased this extra luggage previously to the flight) for that same sole baggage, based on the fact that "flight number is a Olympic number and not an Aegean". I insisted, but no way. I paid and complained later to Aegean Customer Service, that in a first moment repeated the same reason, as if any pax were able to identify airlines flights codes, and as if what is on websites have no value. After a second complain I received a tiny compensation in Status miles credit.

### "A good experience"
London to Athens. A good experience on Aegean Airlines. It's one of the better airlines in Europe. They serve a hot meal and plenty of drink runs in economy. The crew were professional. The boarding was orderly and quick, slightly delayed but it was made up in flight speed. The seat pitch is tight as both flight's were full it was cramped. More than 3 hours and it would be hell. Crew didn't clean the toilets. It was unclean.

### "avoids the use of airbridges"
Athens to Larnaca. My flight was delayed but this happens on many airlines, however this airline avoids the use of airbridges, and on my flights they prefer to use a bus. Even under heavy rain or snow or freezing temps. This was the case again, get on the bus and then on the plane parked far away at Athens temps of 39C, boiling hot. For the return flight, delayed for more than half an hour (no traffic excuse), the captain was American and the announcement made was only in English, hence passengers were wondering what was he talking about, no Greek translation was given.

### "flight to Rome was 45 minutes late"
Athens to Rome. 4 flights, all of them late. Flight from Athens to Mykonos took off 2 hours and 40 minutes after the scheduled time. They apologised with an 8€ meal voucher that arrived by email when we were already boarded, and another one way voucher "valid for travelling within one year with the exception of the period from 20th December to 10th January, Easter as well as the week that follows, and during July and August". Almost useless. On the way back flight to Rome was 45 minutes late.

### "45 minutes in the queue"
Rome  to Larnaca to via Athens. The main problem was dropping off our luggage at Rome airport. Only two service points available and had to wait for 45 minutes in the queue.

### "be warned never to buy goods"
Berlin to Athens. Aegean are in most respects an excellent airline. But you should be warned never to buy goods from their in flight shop. I bought a pair of Bluetooth headphones. They were extremely uncomfortable not being large enough for an average adult male head. It was clear from the moment I put them on that they were not "fit for purpose" and only really suitable for a child. Aegean refused to take them back even though from my point of view the goods were faulty as no adult male could wear them comfortably. So experience the excellent service Aegean provide but avoid the temptation to buy goods in the air. If they are totally unsuitable you won't get a refund.

### "company has services which go from bad to worse"
Not Verified |  Athens to Bucharest with Aegean Airlines. This company has services which go from bad to worse. Last year they were bad, now they are worst. Much worse. The tagging of the luggage was a never ending process with maximum bothering system, consisting in 3 different people from the Aegean trying to use scanners which were not working and redirecting us from one to the other. The process lasted long to infinite because we were seven persons in the group. Moreover, after that, when boarding the bus which lead to the plane, the personnel insisted in a more than aggressive voice and body language in us going into a very crowded bus in which there wasnt any room left for us. More than that, we explained that we could not separate the members of our group because we were 7 and not everyone was speaking english. They separated us nevertheless between two different buses and one of the passengers had a panic attack. We are very malcontent and disappointed with the attitude of the people working for this company with which we interacted during this flight. And the flight was 45 minutes late, of course, this could not have missed from the final picture!

### "Aegean went above and beyond"
After a nightmare experience with United (who rebooked us with their Star Alliance partner Aegean) including several delays, and cancellations, we arrived in Athens to no luggage, which was United's responsibility, not Aegean's. We dealt with United for four days trying to get our luggage from Newark to Athens. Eventually they told us to Taxi back to the airport and promised our luggage was there, a very kind supervisor came out and talked to us to explain the luggage was not, in fact, there. (We did not even ask for a supervisor.) He was very understanding and patient and asked us to trust him. At this point our time in Athens was over and we left the airport to board our cruise ship, thinking there was no way we'd ever get our luggage in the middle of the ocean. The next night there it was in our cabin when we opened the door! We couldn't believe it. The supervisor had gotten our luggage from Newark to Athens, then onto Santorini Island, where our Princess Cruise ship then transported it from the island and onto the ship and then to our room - all within a day. In all we went five days without luggage, but once Aegean was involved we had it within about a day, in a much more difficult route than it would have been for United to simply put it on the plane to Athens. Everyone was so compassionate and kind. But it didn't end there. Upon arriving home, I began the impossible task of dealing with United to receive compensation - they had told us to keep all receipts for the five days without luggage and we had. We spent hours on hold, hours on the phone, getting nowhere. Finally, based on the File Reference number (that I'd given them over and over and over) someone finally clued in and explained the International agreement that wherever you end up is who is responsible for the luggage. Wait, so we get to deal with Aegean again? Wonderful! I called and a kind man explained exactly what to do and gave me an email. In less than a day I got a response telling me exactly what to do to make a very easy process go smoothly. I've spent three weeks with United and got nowhere, while being treated rudely. In the last few days everything has been submitted to Aegean in a easy process with a kind person on the other end helping. We wouldn't have realized how amazing Aegean is had we not had such a bad experience through their sister airline, that only Aegean resolved, for them. Aegean went above and beyond, with every person we dealt with, they will be the first we use if at all possible.

### "had two wonderful flights"
I had two wonderful flights on Aegean Airlines on June 18th and on June 27th between Dusseldorf and Athens. The cabin crew was excellent: They took care of each guest, they were on both segments present at all times with a natural smile and much kindness! I‘ve flown Aegean several times and they really deserve the top ranking. From check-in till baggage-delivery everything went totally smooth! An Airline with an outstanding standard of operation. Delicious meals with a Greek touch, Greek wines and spirits as well as Cappuccino and Espresso on demand! This is truly not common even in Business Class on flights within Europe these days.

### "The perfect flight"
Athens to Madrid. The perfect flight. They gave us breakfast for free in economy class. It was punctual and the staff very kind. The plane was new but it was like flying with an old airline because of the treatment of the staff.

### "One of the nicest airlines"
Athens to Beirut. One of the nicest airlines I have ever flown! The staff were really professional and friendly, the seats were very comfortable and the food was delicious with a great selection of drinks. The seats were very comfortable and the atmosphere was very pleasant. I would give 10/10 if only the plane wasn't delayed twice. However, it was only 30 mins. Highly recommend!

### "catering was awful"
Athens to Heraklion. Our flight from Rhodes to Athens with Aegean Airlines was quite late so upon arrival into Athens we knew it would be a tight connection even though the flight from Athens to Heraklion was still at the airport and this flight was late anyway. We got to the gate to be told the flight had been closed and we were booked onto the next flight. We asked if they could re-open the flight and get us on. They issued the new boarding passes for the next flight and my partner and I were not sitting together as we were just added to the next flight. We asked them to seat us together but they said there was nothing they could do. The annoying things was that the ground and lounge staff didn't try to accommodate us and get us onto our original flight. The crew on the flight were OK but catering was awful for the 50 mins flight.

### "we were very satisfied"
Madrid to Athens. Online booking process very straightforward and easy. Their fares are very competitive. Very easy boarding process, the staff are friendly and helpful. My wife and I flew Madrid to Athens round trip, both airplanes were clean, good legroom, service fine. Meals, well airplane meals are similar, these were okay, the good thing is they included wine in Economy. This has been our only experience with Aegean and we were very satisfied. Good airline.

### "say they would credit the charge"
Santorini to London  via Athens. When my sister and I checked in for the Santorini to Athens flights we had two rollerbags which were labeled cabin baggage on check in by Aegean. (A355 3 June) On our continuing flight to London (A3602 3 June), the gate agent stopped us and demanded that we pay 60 euros for one of our carryons despite the fact they were tagged by Aegean on our previous connecting flight. He would not let us on the plane unless we paid him. We finally paid to not hold up other travelers but in the confusion of this my purse was left on his counter. (not the main check in counter but the one to the side of the door where he collected the money). Immediately upon getting to my seat I noticed the purse missing. I asked the three stewardesses at the front of the plane if I could retrieve my purse at that counter. The man charging us the baggage fee at the last minute could also have run the purse down, and didn't. I could not leave the plane to go up the ramp but they did not offer for one of them to get it for me; and instead waited for a young baggage boy to go see it it was there. What could have been accomplished in 5 minutes took at least 15 or more. He came back and said he did not see it. Literally, it was only 5 minutes from the time we got to our seat to when I could have had a stewardess check the countertop. The attendants could have called the gate but didn't or one of them gone to that counter, but they did not. On arrival at Heathrow, the departure agent called Athens for me and the purse was at lost and found with greek police at airport. They had it at the ticket check in stand after all! They gave me the reference number of 2294 and said to call DHL (maybe UPS) to have it couriered to me. I am not a business and have no way of putting the purse (small fabric dark grey shoulder bag 10 x 12") in a box with a label which was suggested for pickup. Aegean Air, when contacted, said I would have to go through Greek lost and found and could offer no further assistance. I will pay if needed for it to be sent. I obviously am not in Athens and do not know anyone to pick the purse up for me there. The ticket agent in London was helpful but all of the numbers I have tried to reach since then either don't respond or give me another number that doesn't respond. He also said we should not have been charged the 60 euros at the last minute on the continuing flight. After calls and emails the airline finally did say they would credit the charge. It now has taken me five days and numerous long distance calls to get my purse returned. Hopefully this coming week UPS in conjunction with an exceptionally helpful lady in lost and found may be able to return my purse.

### "app very easy and convenient"
Athens to Larnaca return for work. Flights full both ways and punctual. Used the app to check in - very easy and convenient - still able to choose seats, some without charge - a charge applies to the front seats or the extra leg space ones. I was traveling with hand luggage only, however decided to check it in for free. Embarkation done on time and with order. People always trying to get in as much cabin bags as they can, however personnel handled the situation well, taking some on hold and I did not see them fining anybody. Light meal and refreshments served on this 1h30min flight. The return flight was very turbulent all the way, so they served the food, but stopped the drinks service early on. The majority of the passengers did not get anything to drink. Some passengers panicking and vomiting, but the crew managed It well, calming passengers and maintaining a good spirit.

### "pay for a handbag of 7.5kg 25 euros"
Milano to Chania via Athens. I received an email from Aegean for upgrade (but I did not notice that the upgrade was only for the flight Milano-Athens). My offer (80 euros) was accepted. For the flight I had two handbags of 3.5 and 7.5 kg as permitted for Business class (less than the 5 and 8 kg allowance for each handbag). It was only in Athens that I was asked to pay for one of these handbags (Athens-Chania was still economy and only one luggage is permitted) either 60 euros in the gate (with a fine) or to run to check-in 124 of Aegean to pay 25 euros. I had to pay for a handbag of 7.5kg 25 euros. If they had informed me in Milano when I checked in my luggage that I would have to pay for the one handbag in Athens, I would have put the content of small handbag in one of my luggage, since there was space in my baggage. The use of the lounge of Aegean in Athens was not permitted. I wrote to Aegean and customer relations department of Aegean who replied and stated twice only that the flight Athens to Chania was economy. As for the space in the business class. If you get the seats 1A or 1 C is fine. I was in 1F and the space was not something that is worth the money. Also, in row 2 the seats seems to be like the space in the seats+ (why pay for business class?). The folded tables that are opened from the arm of the chair are not convenient.

### "Very comfortable flight"
Munich to Thessaloniki. Good flight and still the only airline that can really be called full service for inter Europe flights. Departure from MUC was an hour late but time was made up during the flight. Onboard staff were friendly and a hot meal was served for breakfast. I am not sure the choice of the pastry is the best item as it was a bit stodgy, bread rolls however were hot and fresh can’t remember that last time that happened on a flight even in business class. Boarding in MUC was via airbridge deplaned via bus. Very comfortable flight.

### "soft drinks were available"
Athens to London. Slightly disappointed by the crew this time round. A passenger behind me asked for tea during the pre-lunch drinks service and was told that only soft drinks were available (not true as Aegean offers wine and beer in its European economy).

### "Very disappointed"
Athens to London Heathrow. I am a gold member of Aegean and since 2 years ago the quality is becoming worse every day. The quality of food in business class is very poor. We were offered lamp and there was not a single piece of meat, only fat. The distance between the rows is extremely small unless you pay extra. I paid 567 euro for this flight and obviously I didn’t want to pay not even 1 euro extra. Practices of low cost companies with tickets of an extremely expensive one. Very disappointed.

### "Really unhelpful staff"
Athens to Vienna. Really unhelpful staff. The app is confusing and it left out my name down twice for the two tickets I purchased. Went to check in and realised this so called and was told I’d get my money back but instead they charged me double the price I paid for the ticket and said they were doing me a favour!

### "very professional airline"
Athens to Larnaca. Aegean is a very professional airline, I have experienced many many flights with them, aircraft though cramped are in excellent condition, flight attendants are given top marks, whilst snacks etc at least on some routes are getting below average, for example on this flight we were given a tasteless small piece of bread which looked like a pie.. As on many airlines you have to pay for check in luggage, pay for a seat if you choose the first 12 rows etc. In general a punctual and reliable airline, but ever so often they avoid jet step walkways and this is my constant complaint, as it has happened many many times especially on this route to Larnaca, or even Munich and London.. On this flight for example we arrived under torrential rain, the airport at Larnaca was half empty and Aegean parked at a distance, go down the stairs, get wet, into the bus and then the drive to the underground entry to the airport.

### "I felt cheated"
Thessaloniki to Athens with Aegean Airlines. I felt cheated by the way they handled my luggage, which by all means did not exceed the maximum weight. The supervisor claimed that my luggage had to loosely fit in the paper box they were using to size the luggage. They charged me an additional $40 euros for the luggage when on the same trip I traveled with AA and Iberia and they gave me no problems with it. On top of it, the supervisor was rude.

### "was expecting something more from Aegean"
On 22th of August 2018, I was traveling with OA flight 254 Athens to Mytilene operated by Aegean. I am a gold member and with me were travelling my parents, my father with special assistance as he has had a coronary angiography. When I went to the lounge and asked at the front office to have my parents as guests, the answer was that I can take only one guest and it’s not possible to take both because the regulation is that only one guest can go with a Gold member. I replied that I know the regulation but due my father’s health circumstances, if they could make an exception and he could sit in a quiet place until boarding the aircraft, the response was again negative, only my father could come with me and my mother should wait outside. At this point I was wondering what would be happening if my mother came with us in an almost empty lounge. Probably they were afraid that they would eat the cheeses at the buffet. I was expecting something more from Aegean as they advertise all the time that: Aegean is civilization, they definitely have a strange idea about what civilization is.

### "the experience was great"
Edinburgh to Rhodes via Athens. We have flown to Rhodes several times using holiday airlines, however last year we decided to use Aegean Air. I must say the experience was great, customer service was friendly and always felt taken care of during the flight. We enjoyed our Aegean Air experience so much we decided to book our next flight in October 19 to Rhodes for our honeymoon. We got a good deal with our flights, however we wished to extend our stay in Rhodes by 3/4 days and Aegean air were going to charge us double our flight cost for us both plus 50 euro each booking fees for changing a flight from a Thursday to Monday. This is rather high for changing one part of our flight. We were rather disappointied that we couldnt extend our stay in Rhodes due to the very high transfer charge - even although the flight isnt until October and its only April. This is rather annoying as they have ben such a good airline to deal with previously.

### "kept up the high standards"
LGW-ATH-LHR Aegean Airlines. Aegean has kept up the high standards; on time, clean aircraft and excellent value for money. Hot meals and sweets on both sectors, with several rounds of drinks. Aegean's economy class offering on medium haul is akin to business class with other airlines. The return fare was £200 cheaper than British Airways who charge for sandwiches and drinks; BA's buy on board concept isn't suitable for destinations like Athens,Istanbul, Larnaca which are not 'short' haul.

### "honest and professional"
Samos to Heraklion via Athens. Aegean Airlines is probably the best airline in Greece, and its service meets higher end companies like Air France. The seats comfortable and space is enough. They rarely have delays and its overall a great experience. The prices for regional routes are quite high, but if you can book a month or two early, you can get a fair deal. Their miles and bonus system I think is below average and generally the promotions with banks to provide cheaper or free flights usually fails to meet expectations. All in all, I believe Aegean airlines is a very honest and professional Airline that meets most of the expectations you can have for a trip!

### "nice and welcoming"
I've travelled with Aegean Airlines in the past and I've been always satisfied with that airline. This time was no exception. I took two flight over the last week. All the fights left on time and arrived early. Check in process in Athens airport was fine and no big line ups. The check in agent even manages to tag my bags to my final destination with a partner airline and they did follow. The crew on all the flights were nice and welcoming. They even helped to make space and store carry on bags in the overheard compartments so the flight could leave as soon as possible. They even hand out candy before take off which makes a nice touch of a warm Greek welcome. There's a complementary meal or snack provided depending on the flight time with a selection of drinks. Aegean Airlines is one the best airlines and the service has improved a lot over the past years. The only downside is that they don't operate flights to the USA or Canada. I will defenetly fly back with them later this year.

### "they might upgrade you"
This review is about the Miles & Bonus Scheme. Aegean are focusing on their in-flight quality of service which is indeed very good. On the other hand their prices can be high even for short distance flights and their Miles & Bonus scheme is a joke. Although I have accumulated a great deal of spending miles, it seems I cannot spend any since in order to find free slots, I have to foresee a trip many months before and it has to not fall within their busy periods, making it pretty impossible to spend them. Even if you want to use the miles to fly 2-3 months ahead, you have to be willing to fly with other star alliance carriers and through other destinations (transit), hence doubling your flight time and hassle. I am a silver card holder (need one more flight to become gold), and I am entitled to 2 upgrades per year from economy to business class. Whenever I try to use these upgrades there never seem to be any available slots/seats. Then a year passes and these vouchers expire. The new trend is to put you on a waiting list and if the flight doesn't get full on that day, then they might upgrade you, but you can't know before the actual day of the trip.

### "half of the cabin unserved"
Athens to Heraklion. Arrival at the airport baggage drop off area, only one counter was servicing 4-5 flights of that time period, while a second one had computer problems and 2 others for B/C and 1 for Special Services were just standing looking the line piling up. When protested about the waiting time which was around 25 mins, no one offered to help with checking in. A second disappointment occurred in the aircraft, where the crew didn't manage (once more) to complete the inflight beverage service. Rather tired from the previous duty, left half of the cabin unserved. Overall, Aegean seems to follow the bad path of the sole Greek air provider by service and quality rapid degradation.

### "rude security check"
Athens to Paris. Quite rude security check after passport control when boarding starts. One manager asked to take my passport without any greeting and was looking at me for 20 seconds and then just got back my passport without saying a word. It was a feeling like I’m a second class citizen maybe because I have Russian passport.

### "Pleasant flight and care"
Athens to Amsterdam. Business class was a good value. Used the app to check in, pretty easy, selected seat whilst making the booking (1A). Fast track security was very fast (although Athens airport is very fast all the times). Went to their lounge, which was very nice, with a good selection of food and drinks. Priority boarding was efficient, warm towel was given 2 times (after take off and after meal). The service was excellent and the food delicious - a traditional Greek meal cooked in a modern way (grilled sea bream and spinach with rice with a touch of lemon). It looked like a young male flight attendand was being trained and the more senior staff were very helpful and supportive to him. Very cheerful and smiling throughout the flight. Pleasant flight and care for the passenger.

### "never disappointed"
Flying with my family from Lax to EWR and than London with United. London to Athens with Aegean Airlines. So happy that we arrived in London and finally we had a flight with Aegean back to Athens. The flights with United was terrible, rude people from the check in at LAX until the and in London. Dear Aegean, you are really small if I compare you with United but you have to give some lessons to them, to tell them about service and “philoxenia”! Living in Samos Island and many times I’m flying Aegean and never disappointed! Hopefully in the future you can fly over the Atlantic too. You have the best aircraft service.

### "good and offered with a smile"
Athens to Bucharest return on evening flights. Outbound flight about 65% full, return flight almost full. Flights on time, snack and drinks offered within the ticket price, were good and offered with a smile. Travelled with hand luggage, but checked it in for free on our outbound flight - that was pretty relaxing. Orderly boarding generally and arrived on time. Tried to use their streaming app, it worked fine, however you need to have your earphones with you (for music and films). Only negative was that in Bucharest a lot of people boarded as gold/family/disabled, when clearly they were not entitled, making it unfair for the rest of the passengers (for example a lady with a 14 year old daughter, or a group of adult youngsters).

### "I would fly Aegean again"
Athens to Tirana. First impressions are lasting impressions. I would fly Aegean again based on our experience. Boarding process was smooth; however, I didn't see why they had two lines when everyone was boarding the same bus to the airplane. Flight Crew was very pleasant. A light Mediterranean style breakfast was served along with complimentary beverages for a flight that is about an hour and 40 minutes in length. Cf, British Airways for a 3 hours flight to Athens (no meal or complimentary beverages). I was able to log on to the Aegean Flight Stream; however, it did not appear to work. We were seated in the exit row with plenty of legroom and width in the seats.

### "Excellent crew and value"
London to Larnaca via Athens. Excellent crew and value for money. One of the few airlines to serve free food/snacks and drinks in flight. My flight from Heathrow was delayed and I had a connection in Athens. Surprisingly, they have connection ambasadors (as Aegean calls them) which are waiting for once you arrive to guide you on your next flight (if both flights are operated by Aegean or Olympic). The seats were comfortable enough as well. I am a star alliance member too. I have flown many times with Aegean and they never let me down. Very pleased.

### "I asked them for an upgrade"
I flew on Aegean from Athens to Cairo, a direct flight and when I arrived in Cairo I received a text informing me that my bag did not arrive in Cairo with me. When I checked my bag that morning 2.5 hours before my flight was scheduled to depart, the rude airline employee put my bag on the conveyor belt after tagging it. The belt stopped and reversed, the bag came back, and I asked the Aegean rep. why. She said without looking at me, "It's overweight! Take it go over there! and then she ignored me. I said, "I just flew yesterday with your airline and the bag weighed 20.3 kg and there is nothing new in it. She kept ignoring me so I went to a different line, where I waited for 30 minutes to be told my bag was not overweight and indeed did weigh 20.3 kg. In Cairo, when I found out my bag had not arrived, I saw that most of the other passengers on my flight had not gotten theirs either. In fact, I later learned that Aegean Airlines had misplaced or lost the luggage of passengers of five different flights in two days! I had to fill out a form and get a complaint number. I expected to hear from the airline that day telling me they had located my bag, but that didn't happen. The next day I got a message from WorldTracer, a luggage tracing service, that my bag had been located "pending confirmation. For an entire week that message remained on the site. I had one email from Aegean Airlines customer service department informing me the day after my flight that my bag had been located and was being flown to Cairo but that proved not to be true. I emailed and called Aegean Airlines and never got a straight answer about where my bag was. I got emails that told me to "rest assured" that they were doing everything they could to resolve the problem. They never returned my calls and only repeated information about being reimbursed for "first needs" for up to 40 euros per day. The list of information they needed to approve reimbursement was ridiculously long. Finally, a week later and only minutes after speaking with another Aegean Airlines customer services rep. and being told they didn't know the whereabouts of my luggage but were doing everything they could to find it, I got an email from the lost luggage office in Cairo airport telling me my bag had been delivered there and I could pick it up. It cost me two taxi rides and five hours to retrieve my bag from the airport. I spent a week not knowing if I'd ever see my belongings again. Deeply regrettably, I still have one flight ahead of me with this terrible airline and I dread turning over my belongings to them. When I asked them for an upgrade for that flight, they told me they weren't able to do that. I'm sorry I can't change my flight.

### "number in Cairo never answers"
Too tight seats and quite humble food. The worst was that my suitcase did not reach Cairo and was left behind in transit. The management of the lost and found was too bad. After two hours of waiting they made us fill a form and promised to call to give updates. They gave us a number to call for inquiry. That number in Cairo never answers. No other numbers available. They didn’t call. I called the HQ in Athens they couldn’t help. It is 12 hours since my flight arrived.

### "the service was great"
Dublin to Athens. It was a rather nice flight. It is the first time I flew Aegean. We did get a snack and drink on board. I will fly them again as the service was great and outstanding.

### "polite and welcoming"
Athens to Prague. I am flying with Aegean Airlines about 4 - 5 times per year and I have enjoyed every trip. I can always find a normal price for the flight, the aircrafts are clean, the staff is so polite and welcoming and the snacks always fresh and tasty. In the Prague airport, the service is as it should be always. Mine only complaints have to do with the airport in Athens, as always are unnecessary delays. The flight to Prague is not using a gateway to the aircraft, but a bus. There is still a priority to Gold and Silver members, for no reason in that case, since everyone will get on a bus. Also, another thing that I had complained in the past in the company's support contact form, is about other's passenger's cabin luggage, which in many are too big in comparison with the proper aircraft cabin luggage. As a result, most of the times, there is an announcement for giving cabin luggage without extra cost in order to be stored in the cargo compartment of the plane. This seems unfair for the people who are typical with their luggage.

### "non stop team work"
Athens to Munich. Hospitality and smiles from aircraft staff. Very responsive on requests and always "non stop" team work to have everyone pleased. Very clean and good seats. Nice weather assisted to perform such a lovely flight to Munich.

### "thoroughly competent performance"
Gatwick to Athens. A late departure of 90 minutes caused by early morning fog at Gatwick which had delayed the incoming flight from Athens was handled competently with regular updates from the flight deck including information for those with connecting flights. Aegean are still a full service airline. Lunch was a chicken and rice dish, which was perfectly adequate, with a full bar service. Athens arrival was to a remote stand with bus connection to the terminal. This all worked well but there was a disappointingly long wait at immigration for EU citizens with no wait for 'other' passports. More an airport issue than an Aegean one. Overall a thoroughly competent performance.

### "What more you could ask for"
Amman to Athens. There is nothing to write about this flight. Aegean Airlines delivered what was important: air travel from point A to point B, on-time, reasonably comfortable, with decent service. What more you could ask for?

### "a nice customer service"
A good, hassle free airline with a nice customer service. There was no delay but they didn’t provide me food on route from Paris to Athens. The plane was new and I could not hear the plane sound during flight. So my ear didn’t hurt.

### "flight attendants very friendly"
Cairo to Munich via Athens. We flew Aegean because their flight was convenient, not too expensive and the fee for extra luggage was very fair. We moved back from Egypt to Germany, so we had a lot of luggage. Check-in was done by Egypt Air staff and was efficient. We were allowed by airport security to use an unused check-in counter to check the weight of our luggage and we had to repack a bit, so when we checked in, our 5 suitcases matched the weight-requirement exactly. The clerk seemed to be a bit disappointed. Boarding the aircraft was on time and flight attendants were very friendly and helpful with our hand luggage. My wife was carrying a musical instrument and nobody cared that it was quite bulky. Service on the first leg cannot be rated, as we both fell asleep before even take-off (it was 3:30 a.m.). Changing planes in Athens was okay, only the departure gate was anounced quite late. Then the flight to Munich was nice, flight attendants very friendly, breakfast was okay, beverage selection fine. All luggage arrived on time in Munich. I cannot remember any in-flight entertainment, as I was mostly sleeping, but on flights with duration less then 2,5 hours one does not need entertainment.

### "staff were polite and helpful"
Istanbul to Athens. I made six different flights with Aegean Airlines and its subsidiary Olympic Airways in a mix of business/economy classes on Airbus A320 and Dash-8 planes. All left and arrived on time. The Aegean/Olympic staff both on the ground and in the air were polite and helpful. Meals, when they were served, were good. The planes were clean and comfortable. The lounge in Athens Airport had really good food and a selection of Greek wines.

### "recommend the airline"
As a Gold Member I fly regularly with Aegean and can compliment the timeliness, friendliness and professionalism of staff. I have been flying regularly from London to Thessaloniki via Athens (approx. 16 flights a year). On this occasion I was more than disappointed. The flight was delayed (not the airlines fault) but the crew did not seem to be interested in the comfort of staff. On several occasions elderly passengers struggled to place their luggage in the overhead bin and received no assistance from crew who stood by and watched. I was surprised by this as I usually they always assist. Due to the delay in take off the connection time in Athens would be shorter than normal. At this point, as always, I was not worried as Aegean usually does a excellent job in handling connection flights. Upon arrival to Athens and once departing the plane the connection Ambassador was shouting for anyone going to Thessaloniki to hurry - very unwelcoming! To make it worse she then decided to start sprinting and was shouting at everyone you have to run! Run or you will not make it. Looking at my fellow passengers who were mostly elderly this was more than unacceptable. My partner as well, due to an injury could not keep up. I told the member of staff to calm down and take it slow but she kept shouting to run and hurry. At this point I decided to proceed on my own with my partner to the gate and we made it in plenty of time before boarding had even started. Never have I experienced such rude behavior and such unnecessary stress. As a connection ambassador she should have known that there was time and that we would have easily made it to the gate with time left to spare. Instead everyone was pushed to walk at a fast pace with people struggling and no one taking notice. Aegean needs to review this and ensure the ground staff offer a good connecting experience with staff making sure everyone reaches their next flight in comfort. Even with the bad experience I can only recommend the airline and all they have achieved but find it necessary to share all types of feedback.

### "pre-boarding for families"
Thessaloniki to Athens. We checked in just fine, gave our luggage in, went through security and arrived at the Aegean lounge within minutes. We had booked a separate seat for our son with the intention of using a car seat for him. When we showed out boarding passes to the nice lady that greeted us in the lounge we inquired about pre-boarding for families. She did not know anything about it and simple said that we would be boarding from the lounge area when an announcement is made. We also inquired about gate checking the stroller and receiving it for use at our connecting airport in Athens she did in fact state that we could take the elevator down to the bus which would take us to the aircraft for boarding and that there we could gate check the stroller to be given back to us when we arrive at the gate in Athens. When the time came we heard the announcement for boarding for our flight and as we gave our boarding passes to the same lady that greeted us on the way in, she scanned them, checked our passports and asked us to wait next to the door to take us to the elevator. After all passengers went through the door, we were asked to follow her to the elevator to find that there was a line there of approx. 6 passengers in wheel chairs waiting to use it. Also the bus that all other passengers boarded was waiting on us. At this point she asked if we could carry the child in hand to walk the stairs down to the bus, and she offered to carry the stroller down as well. Although I did appreciate the offer, this was not an ideal situation. When we got to the bus, I was holding our son, my wife was holding carry on luggage and I had to manage a folded stroller as well, all while standing in a moving bus. Perhaps if as they advertised had offered proper pre-boarding for families with young children these things could go a bit smoother. We arrived at the aircraft and gave the stroller to the person standing at the bottom of the stairs, to be returned to us when we arrived in Athens. Got on board the aircraft, started installing the car seat for my son, which thankfully did not take long. We were told by the staff on board that the child would have to be sitting on either mine or my wife's lap for take-off and landing and they provided us with a seat belt extension to use for this. As in a previous flight, I did not argue with the staff and complied. Lufthansa did not have any issues with the use of a car seat used during take-off and landing. In any case the safest place for a child under the age of 2, is securely fastened in a car seat with a 3 point harness. When we arrived at Athens and de-boarded, we asked for our car seat and they were searching for it, while the bus to take us to the terminal was waiting for us. Took them a few minutes, but they found it. One last thing that I would like to point out is the fact that the plane was late departing from Thessaloniki, and that we had a connecting flight from Athens which we barely made thanks this. The thing that made this situation even worse was the fact that the bus driver delivered us to a door all the way on the other end of the terminal were we had to go.

### "not so pleasant"
Munich to Thessaloniki. This was the first time we flew with our infant son and were really excited to be flying with Aegean as in the past we have had a very good experience with them. This time around though it was not so pleasant. We had booked three seats (all business) so that we could place a car seat on board for our 14 month old son. We expected to be boarding before all others in the plane thus having plenty of time to put our things away and to install the car seat in the seat and securing our son. This was not the case. When it came time to board they announced boarding for business class customers so a whole lot of people lined up in front of us - no pre-boarding for families was offered as advertised on their website. When we got into the jet-way we were greeted by an Aegean Airlines employee who asked us about the car seat being checked to the final destination. We explained that we had purchased a seat for this, he demanded to see 4 boarding passes. Yes - 4 boarding passes, one for me, one for my wife, one for my son, and one for the car seat. I remember thinking you have got to be kidding me. After a few minutes of explaining to him that we had purchased 3 seats and one was for an infant with the intention of using a car seat for safety and after he said he had to check with the staff on board we were allowed to board. All 3 of us (or 4 of us according to that employee). So at this point all other passengers were boarding, so I had to wait for the car seat install until all passengers were on board - not an ideal situation. Furthermore we were told that we could not use the car seat during take-off and landing and the child had to sit on either myself or my wife using a seat belt attachment which they provided. At this point I was really not in any mood to argue with anyone and I did as they requested. We had our son sitting on our lap for take-off and landing instead of him being safely secured in car seat with a 3-point harness. Let me point on that this was a connecting flight for us from NYC which we flew Lufthansa and they had no issues with our son sitting in his car seat safely secured, yet Aeagean Airlines employees thought it to be unsafe due to regulations.

### Aegean Airlines customer review
I flew from London to Cairo via Athens. Once arrived in Cairo we found that one of our bags went missing. We filled in a report form and told we would be contacted shortly. We received no reply for the duration of 2 weeks at which point I went to their office on the 4th floor in Cairo airport to find out that the bag had arrived and was returned once again to Athens. We were never contacted or informed of its arrival. The lady I spoke to said she would contact Athens and request for it to be returned. 2 weeks later we still have no bag and the office in Cairo is saying they have received no reply from Athens. Absolute shambles.

### "we had to change aircraft"
Athens to Hamburg. Overall a very bad experience. We boarded the aircraft for the flight to Hamburg through a jetway and while taxiing they told us that there is a problem and we had to change aircraft. We were waiting inside the aircraft without any other information and about an hour later we were asked to deplane to a bus and then board another aircraft through a boarding ramp. Aegean could have used a jetway to avoid this hassle and they should have better informed us about the expected delay. We arrived at Hamburg delayed by at least 2 hours and no apology throughout the flight. All staff behaved as if nothing had happened. My family missed their train connections and had to pay for new expensive tickets.

### "food was not from Aegean"
Stuttgart to Thessaloniki back in April 2018. I spend a lot of money to upgrade my economy ticket to a business ticket. On board welcome was ok but cool. My seat in 1A was okay, cabin was clean. The food on this day was not from Aegean, they give a plastic box with potato salad and other vegetables. I never upgraded my flight for 280 euros for the one way flight, it is a shame, is these are  taste of Greece?

### "Everything was fine"
Larnaca to Athens. Everything was fine. The crew was very friendly, the food was Great. I like the luxury feeling that it gives you compared to other airlines performing the route from LCA to ATH. m very satisfied.The only thing that disappoints me is that the baggage maximum weight is 8kg and other airlines have it as 10kg.

### "Worse than with low cost companies"
Not Verified |  Being a gold member of star alliance and Miles & Bonus I have certain expectations from a company. Aegean is still a decent airline but the benefits for gold members are less and less and the motivation to remain a loyal customer is being decreased on a daily basis. The free vouchers for parking make no sense if you are parking the car for more than 24 hours as booking your parking through Athens Airport website is always cheaper even if you use the "free coupons". Buying a seat at the front of the aircraft is also obligatory for gold members with flights being extremely expensive especially during summer period. The seats behind the emergency exits (which are for free) are unbearable. Worse than with low cost companies.

### "I'm very satisfied"
Thessaloniki to Nuremberg . I'm very satisfied with Aegean Airlines onboard product. I've flown with them several times the last few months. Some facts that deserve mentioning are clean and modern cabin, confortable seats (even though i think those could be a little more comfortable but they are ok for short-haul flights), polite cabin crew that makes you feel welcome onboard, nice food and beverages and finally good ground services. I suggest flying this airline.

### "the flight was enjoyable"
Heraklion to Toulouse. There was a slight delay because of air traffic but as a whole the flight was enjoyable and the staff was polite. The beverage I chose was an apple juice. I would really enjoy it if I could lean my seat back but the seat was locked in the upright position and it can get tough to stay in that position for three hours.

### "lose your bags twice"
I flew from London to Athens in July 2018 with 4 bags, paying extra for the service. Only 2 bags arrived. I made a report on arrival. The following day I was flying from Athens to Luxor via Cairo. I received an email after I had checked on for my flight that my bags had been found. As I had 2 hours before departure I had time to go and reclaim them. I went downstairs and was shown a store room, my bags were there however one of them a 33kg bag I had paid for was ripped and was not in any condition to make any extra journeys. At the desk I was offered that they could replace the one big broken bag with 2 smaller ones. I accepted and I took one of the bags to Egyptair and checked it on whilst leaving the other with their supervisors to check in so I didn’t have to pay a fine for an extra bag. This bag was left in with them to send on the same flights and meet me in Luxor. The bag didn’t arrive plus I didn’t have any ticket for the bags to trace. I started the very very long and painful process of trying to find my bag via email. This was 7 weeks ago. Every week I get the same generic email that says they are at my disposal and want to help. Finally yesterday I had an email telling me to go to Luxor airport and get my bags proving me with ticket references. I arrive at Luxor airport only to find they have provided the ticket of the bags from London to Athens which are shown as claimed. But their email states this are from Athens to Luxor. This is the most ridiculous situation I’ve ever encountered. How can an airline lose your bags twice and provide ticket numbers from previous flights.

### "trip is generally good"
Barcelona to Cairo via Athens. The trip is generally good, but I ordered a halal meal and I had booked the ticket for the sector Barcelona to Athens. On the flight to Cairo, the hostess gave me a regular meal and when I asked her she told me it is halal. But the meal has no proof that it is halal. I told her that the meal is not halal. She told me that my name does not exist on the list. I gave her a booking ticket, and after I made sure my name was on the list. She told me that have not more halal meal.

### "seats and cabin were clean"
Flying with my wife on 5th October 2017 from Madrid Terminal 2 to ATH. At check in the Spanish ground staff was polite, but went to extra lengths to explain the carry on luggage policy and insisted on checking in everything at no extra cost. Had fragile items that wanted on us, below the 8kg weight rule. Eventually, they let us carry our entitlement! At the Terminal 2 gate, there was a delay of approximately 15-20 minutes. Boarding was fine, and staff did not weigh any carry on luggage. Once on the aircraft, seats and cabin were clean. Lunch and the traditional Greek dessert from Rhodes offered was excellent! Were quite tired so did not use the inflight entertainment system. Overall, an excellent flight with excellent inflight service. I do not award full stars because of the luggage policy and the delay at Barajas Terminal 2 .

### "reduce the excess weight"
Terrible customer service at Heathrow check-in and boarding gate. There was no Aegean Airlines staff to assist passengers. The staff at check-in and at the gate appeared to be untrained or poorly trained, and two of them were rude, abrupt, and unwilling to help me with a simple issue about my baggage excess weight with one stating to leave me behind if I did not reduce the excess weight and the other at the gate, forced me to check in my quite small cabin bag in which I had my laptop, hard drive and other equipment.

### "asked to weigh my carry-on bag"
London to Athens. After scanning my boarding pass the ground staff asked me to weigh my carry-on bag, found that it weighed 10.5 kg :  2.5 kg above the permitted 8 kg per passenger and asked me to pay GBP 70 because  they needed to check my bag in as overweight. When I protested and said that I would transfer some items to my children's carry-ons in order to reduce the weight to 8kg, the ground staff threatened to weigh all our carry-ons / hand luggage and shopping to verify that they met the 8 + 3kg limit per person. It is disappointing to experience such behaviour with my national airline which I have been using loyally for over 15 years. If an airline wishes to verify carry-on weights, then they should apply its checks across the board and not pick passengers arbitrarily. I bought almost 4 months in advance a round-trip ticket from Athens to London including a checked in suitcase for EUR 528 including taxes, and ended up paying Aegean EUR 608. A final point I would like to make is that using SAS as ground staff to represent Aegean Airlines at LHR that seriously damage its reputation - irreparably in my case.

### "a solid performance"
Not Verified |  Prague to Kefalonia via Athens. A solid performance from Aegean. We always manage to find great pricing. Staff on board  very pleasant and well groomed. Food is lovely and in economy class hot meals are served. Flights punctual in our case. Two areas of improvement needed. One is Wi Fi and in flight entertainment. In flight magazine is the best.

### Aegean Airlines customer review
Athens to Brussels. I arrived there for my flight to Brussels with a big suitcase that contained a bicycle. The staff charged me a plus from 50 euro (I already paid a ticket for that suitcase and brought it to Greece with an identical ticket). So i paid for the suitcase in total 90 euro to get it to Belgium. I think they overcharged me this time, on the site is shows a 50 euro charge. They don't talk English on a level that they can solve problems. They don't take payments with Maestro, so I had to search for an ITM to get the money they charged me.

### "provide some entertainment?"
Not Verified |  We traveled economy class from Athens to Marseilles France on July 11, 2018. We were very impressed with Aegean, from ticketing, to boarding, to the food and drinks. We are United million milers, and were very pleased to have been able to check in in the Business Class line and for our luggage to be given priority. The flight attendants were super awesome, and not at all surly like American flight attendants. Very pleasant, nice cabin crew. They were very sweet to our kids as well. The food was delicious. But please Aegean, can’t you provide some entertainment? At least allow for free wi-fi for entertainment or even wi-fi for purchase.

### "will fly them again"
Madrid to Athens. Although Aegean only operates short haul flights, the feeling is they would have what it takes to handle longer routes. The aircraft was tidy, well maintained and even smelled good. Crew attentive, perfectly groomed and extremely nice. Aegean serves hot meals  in economy class - with a choice between meat and pasta, even in a 3 hours short haul flight, and it tasted fairly good. Chocolates and mints after the meal were a nice touch. Seats in line with  European flights (cramped), on-time takeoff and on-time landing. Would  recommend and will fly them again to get to Greece.

### "Best service ever"
Not Verified |  I Would like to give the flight between Athens - Copenhagen on July 16 2018, 100 stars if I could. This is about My son who was on the flight yesterday. He is so scared of flying and suffers from claustrophobia and panic attacks. He was sending Me text messages when they were boarding telling Me That he is getting a panic attack and wants to get off the plane. I told him to talk to the flight attendents so That they can calm him down. And they did! After he got off the plane on Copenhagen, he called Me. Telling Me about the fantastic service from all your flight attendants.They checked on him the whole flight. Gave him water, food etc. Made sure he was ok. Please let the flight attendants get this message. You were fantastic. Thank you so Much. My son Will only fly with Aegean airlines from now on. Best service ever!

### "a very comfortable flight"
Had a very comfortable flight from Heraklion to Zurich. I experienced a friendly and professional cabin crew and they served excellent food for an economy class flight. Unfortunately, there were no monitors at all in the airplane. A map which tells me where the airplane is, is all in-flight-entertainment I would need.

### "staff were polite"
On holiday with my wife. An evening direct flight from ATH to MAD with Aegean Airlines. Check in was efficient and quite speedy. Was a problem when the departure gate changed about 20 minutes before departure time and was not easy to find due to works at the departure area at ATH. After we got there, there was a further delay of approximately 30 minutes, which eventually most of it was covered by the pilot and arrived at Barajas T2 only about 10 minutes late. Onboard, service was good - staff were polite, food was very good and inflight entertainment was satisfactory. Also, cabin was clean. I do not award "full marks" due to all these luggage restrictions, which have become entrenched in the majority of world's airlines but especially european ones.

### "outstanding service"
Zurich to Heraklion return. Hats off to Aegean Airlines! My wife and I have been flying to Crete each summer for the last eight years. In the past we have flown with a Swiss charter air line. Which was a pain in the butt, for we had to travel when they did, not when we wanted! This time we went with Aegean Check in at Zurich was just outstanding, AAS did their best to move things along even with a long line, done in less than 20 minutes. This was a late night flight, It left on time, and the in flight service was one of the best that I have experienced in a long time. The only interesting comment I can make about the flight down, was the landing, let's just say it was a copilot landing. The best part of the trip was the return flight. Those of us who have traveled to Heraklion, know that the airport is a pit of pain and agony. I will address this issue, in a separate review,for things have changed. With Aegean they have there own separate check in counter, and a self check in, away from the madding charter craziness. Checkin was completed in 10 minutes! This was just fantastic! Where in the past it took hours! Ther was only a slight delay in takeoff due to weather/air traffic in Zurich, in flight service was outstanding again. After 14 years of long haul air travel for work, I have to give Aegean four stars in respect of outstanding service!

### Aegean Airlines customer review
London to Athens. I pay £16 to sit in a seat at the front that has a curtain right in front of me. Then there was no space for my luggage so it’s down the back which means I have to wait for the plane to empty before I can get it although business class empty cabinets. I am a silver member and the supposed 2 free ticket upgrades have never been available.

### "It was a pleasant flight."
Mykonos to Athens. Check in smooth and easy - decided to print my boarding pass, as my mobile phone battery was dying. No paper on the e-check in machines, so had to use the desk, but this was quick and easy. Security in Mykonos airport was a breeze. Not enough seating on the gate. Aircraft arrived on time and was prepared for departure at a record time. Boarding was easy, both from the front and back - we just had to walk to it. Also quick and smooth. Full flight. They had asked some people to give their hand luggage for storage, so there was enough space on the cabin. Initially we were told that due to heavy traffic in Athens we'd have to wait 35', however better assignment was requested by the captain and we left just with 10' delay. Crew very professional. We were offered a greek local snack in this very short flight 25'). Landing on time. It was a pleasant flight.

### "The seating is economy"
Jeddah to Athens. The seating is economy with the center seat blocked. There is no entertainment system. No coat chef, amenity bag or blanket. There were pillows and newspapers. The single attendant for business class was not available. The window blinds in the cabin were not closed so when the sun rose the cabin was flooded with light. The product is terrible. This is a 3.45 am departure (3hr 30min flight) and there are no services to accommodate night flight passengers. Turkish flies a similar route and is markedly superior product.

### "very friendly and efficient"
Not Verified |  Athens to Chania return. Was pleasantly surprised by Aegean having no idea what they would be like. It’s only a short flight but each flight was on time, boarding started when it said it would, crew are very friendly and efficient. Would definitely fly again.

### "airline was so great"
Not Verified |  Who knew that this airline was so great! On a short 30 minute flight from Athens to Santorini you still get served mints and a snack. New planes with generous seating I would definitely fly Aegean again. Certainly worth the few extra bucks for great service and comfort. Not 5 stars as Santorini airport is a disaster and although Aegean doesn't own it, would love to see them put pressure on investing in its infrastructure.

### "offers a very good business class product"
This review is about my recent trip with a friend from Athens (ATH) to Tel Aviv in the Aegean business class. 1) Athens airport: The airport in Athens has several lounges. Having a Star Alliance Gold card, we checked-out the Lufthansa lounge in the Schengen area before we made our way to the Aegean Lounge in the Non-Schengen area. Both lounges are above standard, but the Aegean lounge is better and we especially enjoyed the smoothies and sweets. Considering it is the flagship lounge of Aegean at their main hub, I wonder why it does not have shower facilities and an area to relax/sleep. On the other hand Aegean focusses on short- and medium-haul flights and does not find it necessary. 2) Seat: It would be great if Aegean would have a real business class chair. But like most – if not all – European airlines the business class had regular economy class seats with the middle seat being blocked by a table. The armrests could be moved sideways so the seat was wider. The seats in the first row offer enough legspace – only the emergency exit row in economy class has more legspace. There were no power outlets in the seat. 3) Onboard product: We found it nice that we were given menu and a wine carte. In addition to the meals offered onboard, business class passengers can pre-order other local dishes as well as special meals. I pre-ordered the Moussaka and it was really good. The airplane had overhead monitors were a film about Greece was shown. No WiFi and no personal device entertainment. 4) Verdict: Aegean offers a very good business class product compared to other European airlines. Seats should have power outlets. We were on vacation so power outlets and wifi were not that important to us. The onboard service is above standard and that is what was important to us.

### "cabin crew was kind"
Great service from check in to landing. Check in agent was very polite. The boarding was Excellent. The food onboard was delicious and tasty. The cabin crew was kind too.

### "very good onboard service"
Munich to Athens. We travelled in economy class in a tariff that includes luggage. Aegean is a member of Star Alliance, my friend holds an Aegean Gold Status and I am a United 1K. That gave us some advantages such as using the business class check-in, fast lane security and lounge access. The check-in in Munich is handled by Lufthansa and the agents were nice and professional. We used the business class counter and did not have a lot of wait time. Lufthansa lounges in Munich are good. Seat: Aegean sells seats in the emergency exit row, I find it disappointing that these are not offered for free to Aegeans/Star Alliance gold customers at the time of booking or at check-in. The airplane was full and we had seats (aisle and middle) in the back of the plane. The seat spacing was comparatively very small. Onboard service: Even in economy, we were offered a full meal. Aegean offers a good selection of wines and soft drinks. The crew was very friendly. Aegean offers very good onboard service but the legspace was horrible. That is why I am subtracting three points. We had redeemed Upgrade Vouchers and were on the waiting list. Although seats were empty in Business Class (and up for sale), these were not released before take-off. Too bad.

### "cancelled our flights"
Manchester to Skiathos via Athens to fly in June 2018. A text from them told me they cancelled our flights due to 'Operational Requirements' 6 weeks before our holiday and to ring them. They offered night flights several days later or to travel 5.5 hours to fly from Heathrow. Work, Pre-booked Trains. hotels and ferries meant we had to travel on that day from Manchester as Heathrow was £300 more for us to get there at short notice. At no point were they going to meet extra travel costs or compensate the 4 of us in any way other than refund our flights which we have had to do. Why they didn't provide a coach to transport people from Manchester - Heathrow I don't know and the unsympathetic attitude to our prearranged details astounded us. The result is we are flying with an alternative airline at a cost of £500 more per couple. Customer Services are next to useless and online only as there's nobody you can talk to in person. I'm still awaiting my refund which they say will take 10-15 working days. Today it's come to our attention that they're operating a flight out of Manchester on the morning our flight was due to depart via Brussels which would get us to Athens at a similar time to what we should have arrived. Upon bringing this to their attention and asking why we weren't offered this option they say they use Aegean Flights only in these situations. The first leg was operated by Brussels Airlines and the second part being Aegean themselves. They sell the flights, there was room on the flights yet we were not offered the option of them even though it would've been the easy alternative. It's the last time we'll fly with them. They keep telling me all carriers modify flights and can change but this is the first time it's happened in my lifetime.

### "did not know about luggage policy"
Madrid to Athens. I booked the flight through skyscanner then made final booking through tripsta. There was no option there to choose or pay for sporting equipment (travelling with a bicycle) so I paid for checked in luggage 23kgs. At the check-in I was told I have to pay 50 euros for the bike. I asked if i could pay the difference as I did not know about their luggage policy when I was booking the ticket. I was told they were not responsible for their middlemen (here tripsta). The staff was not helpful. At the end they even checked my hand luggage as it was 11 kgs. I could have put those extra 3 kgs in the bike as bikes don't have a weight restriction according to Aegean Airlines website. Very bad service and lots of unnecessary hassle. I spent over half an hour making the payment at the till. Had to pay cash as the terminal was not working.

### "uncomfortable flight time"
Larnaca to Tel Aviv. This is the second time I was to fly Aegean Airlines. This time I bought tickets to fly in August 2018 in high price for comfortable flying hours since I am flying with young children. I found out the company cancel our flight and listing us to the uncomfortable flight time with no compensation. I will not fly Aegean Airlines again.

### "staff is very friendly"
Hamburg to Athens. Aegean Airline is one of the best airlines in Europe. The staff is very friendly and helps, if you have any questions or problems. The airplane was clean and in a very good condition. The food in the Business Class was very tasty. The variety of drinks is also very good. Everyone, who fly to Greece, must try Aegean Airlines!

### "the flight was fantastic"
Flew from Tel Aviv to Thessaloniki, and I must say that I was completely satisfied with my flight. The food was great, the staff was excellent, and super polite (as usual) and the plane was clean and on time. The only small issues were that the seats were just a little bit uncomfortable for a two and half hour flight (they were too thin to be precise), the legroom was a bit tight, and there was no inflight entertainment. Other than that, the flight was fantastic! I can't wait for Aegean to start flying long-haul, as I would definitely fly with them on those long routes!

### "crew is always welcoming"
Athens to Zurich. What has started as an excellent airline has slowly degraded to an airline with amenities  as good as those from a premium low cost. On the other hand crew is always welcoming and well trained. The airline is using bus-transport from the flight out from Athens to Zurich. It is unacceptable the least for the price paid at around 250 to 300 per person. Food quality has  deteriorated over the years, what used to be eggs and bacon became a low quality half piece cheese pie? Also a new policy to pay for front row seats during online checkin. My seat was slightly broken, but leg room more than sufficient.

### "had the old inflight magazine"
Athens to Bucharest. Waiting in the bus (15-20min) to get to the plane, the flight was less than half full and they wanted to wait for all passengers in order to use only 1 bus. They had the old inflight magazine. Recently Aegean changed their policy and started charging seat selection up to row 14. As a result, the second half of the plane was packed and the front was empty. Crew did not allow passengers to move to front seats. Snacks must be the worst ever.

### "disturbed by unacceptable behaviour"
London to Athens. I was at Heathrow and I had a carry-on baggage well below the required dimensions. Many people with bigger baggage were boarding without weighing them but then a rude gate agent weighed mine and found it heavier by 1kg and demanded in a very bad way to either pay a huge surcharge or be left at the airport! I found that unreasonable but I proposed to take out something if that was the case. They did not let me do that and strictly asked for my credit card to charge me or else deny me boarding the aircraft. I regret my choice to fly for the first time with Aegean. I will never fly with them again and the same will also happen with many other passengers of that flight that have been disturbed by the unacceptable behavior and offensive attitude.

### "recommend to fly with Aegean"
Rome to Thessaloniki via Athens. A very good experience! The handling was nice. We had only a delay because of bad weather condition in Rome. The cabin crew was very polite and helpful. The food was nice, any snack and drink was made by top brands. I would definitely recommend to fly with Aegean Airlines.

### "Narrow and hard seats"
Athens to Naples. Departure with some delay. Crowd at the gate. DHC8 are not the most comfortable planes to fly with. Narrow and hard seats, very cramped. In the particular one couldn't even fit my cabin baggage on the space above my head. On return, fare prices are noticeably cheaper than on jet aircraft. Crew served cold snack as there are no kitchen facilities on this aircraft.

### "Great service overall"
Rome to Athens. Flight was almost full, but departed almost on time. Ground crew offered to check in our baggage for free. Crew served hot small meal, good taste and choice. Even with full cabin they managed to serve coffee before landing preparation take place. Great service overall.

### "it felt efficient and hospitable"
Very reliable and definitely positive experience with all aspects from check in to flight. I flew Berlin Tegel to Athens on an A320. Check in with Aegean Airlines at Berlin Airport was pretty fast. Berlin Tegel is one of the of the most mediocre airports but Aegean check in was fully manned / all seats full with check in staff. Fast check in / very kind personnel. Flight was almost 100% full. Crew were always with a smile and this was a full flight with lots of kids. All in all it felt efficient and hospitable. Food was hot, I ordered for free a Low Fat meal during booking, I think this must be the only airline in Europe still serving hot food + special meals for free in Economy. You can pick any meal during booking through their site. Bread also served, refreshments or wine, coffee, juice etc. Crew were always smiling. Normal economy seat size is very decent. They offer the option of paying to get a "front seat" with extra leg room. I have done it in the past and it was worth the 15-20 euros needed. This time I went for a simple seat at the rear of the aircraft, space was decent. I would not complain really, this is a very competitive fare price. If you feel you'll need some more extra space do go for the seat upgrade option for a few extra bucks. Nevertheless for the price / seat combination I was more than happy and ok with my seat size. Flight left on time, maybe 5 minutes late, arrived earlier. All in all a good uneventful flight with good service. No in-flight entertainment but good food / good in-flight crew service without a doubt. Do get some episodes of what you like downloaded onto a cellphone or tablet before hand and problem solved. All in all I would pick Aegean Airlines again based on the efficiency, accuracy of flight time and good fare when you book early / very good crew. Positive flight experience at a time when most European carriers are offering way less than them.

### "no coffee was served at all"
Copenhagen to Athens. We are flying Aegean Airlines every time we visit Greece, and are very happy with the flights, the crew and the catering. But, something went wrong at our latest trip  on March 29th: no coffee was served at all after the meal! We just wonder why? The catering has been perfect all previous flights. Just curious to know the reason. We strongly recommend Aegean.

### "high standard of this airline"
I had already seen online that the incoming flight from Thessaloniki was coming into Frankfurt with a delay of about 2 hours in December 2017, but there was no announcement regarding my flight from Frankfurt to Athens, either on the Frankfurt airport or the Aegean Airlines website regarding a delay. I called the call center and I was told that they had no update on that flight and to try to call the Frankfurt office who had no update and  the delay of the incoming flight does not mean a delay of my departure, as there might be another aircraft for my flight. When I went to the airport, it was announced that there  is a delay of 2 hours. We ended up leaving with about a 3 hours delay, during which we were not offered anything and the counter was closed and nobody there. I had to kill 3 hours in Frankfurt airport which I could have avoided. The airline failed to inform me. Other than that the flight was full and the level of service pretty much of the high standard of this airline.

### "experienced very poor service"
I experienced very poor service on the delayed flight from Athens to Heraklion on the 17th of March 2018. I was at the airport for more than 24 hours, very tired and anxious after traveling for a week in Germany. After the trip I also contacted customer care to express my complaints and they also had the same cold attitude that they did at the airport.

### "definitely worth it to upgrade"
Athens to Bucharest. I enjoyed a lot my Business Class flight. Even for such a short flight (about 1,5h) the lunch was complete, including appetizer, main course and dessert. We were also offered hot towels which were very refreshing. The cabin crew was discreetly checking if we need anything, making you feel well. It's definitely worth it to upgrade!

### "this flight was really nice"
Athens to Dusseldorf. I travel frequently with Aegean and this flight was really nice. The cabin crew was really friendly and helpful. The whole flight from Athens to Dusseldorf was really flawless. The landing was perfect. We didn't even understand that we had landed (there was not even a short tremble when the wheels touched the ρθνςαυ). I definitely recommend Aegean Airlines.

### "have wonderful cabin staff"
Larnaca to London via Athens. They have wonderful cabin staff and are helpful, there with a smile. The food on board is very good as is the service, even though my flight stops over in Athens rather than direct, its still enjoyable. Only problem I had was first time at ATthens, when you are in transit its not clear where to go when you enter the airport . Apart from that can't fault anything keep up the good work.

### "need to review your catering"
Cairo to Athens. Cairo airport boarding, everyone just went through long line up to board. As it was a 10.30 am flight breakfast was served,  a shriveled up omelet and two small pieces of smoked turkey,  a fruit salad with cottage cheese. Bread roll and croissant as well. The poorest breakfast I have been served on a flight in business class. I find it very strange that the food they served out of Cairo did not reflect Greek wonderful cuisine. I might as well have travelled economy would have better in the long run. I am not impressed with Aegean you need to review your catering.

### "I can recommend this airline"
Istanbul to Amsterdam via Athens. First flight of was operated by Olympic Air. The plane was a DHC-8-400. There was enough legroom and the seats were comfortable. After take-off, the cabin crew started the snack/drink service. Everyone got a cheese/beacon sandwich, but I am a vegetarian so I asked them if they had a vegetarian sandwich. They had vegetarian sandwiches and I got  2 drinks with the sandwich. From Athens, I took my next plane towards Amsterdam. This flight was operated by Aegean itself and the plane was an A321. There was enough legroom and the seats were comfortable. 30 minutes after take-off, the cabin crew started to serve meal and drinks to everyone onboard. Sadly, they didn't had a vegetarian option. But beside the meal itself everything was tasty. After I finished the meal I have slept till our descent towards Amsterdam. We arrived safely at Amsterdam. All-in-all I give both flights together a 9/10. I can recommend this airline.

### "London to Athens"
London to Athens. Excellent experience, boarding was efficient and organized, clean aircraft with welcoming friendly crew. After take off, drinks served, cleared, hot meal served in economy (simple but good, hot pasta, eggplant salad, warm bread with cheese and butter, cookie) coffee and tea trolley passed twice. Flight landed 45 minutes early, priority bags came off first 15 minutes after landing. Impressive experience.

### "probably to avoid paying for jetsteps"
Flew Aegean Airlines from Athens to Larnaca. I have always wondered how such an airline that ever so often avoids jetsteps at airports, especially on this route going and/or coming can be honoured with a title. Yes, cabin staff are very professional, aircraft is clean, spacious. Yet, once again on our flight 912 / 9.2.18 arriving at 12.20 at a half empty LCA airport, the plane parked once again away from the terminal probably to avoid paying for jetsteps, and in use the good old romantic bus just like in the 50s. Inflight we were given a tasteless piece of bread which the hostess described as cheese pie, probably without any cheese inside. For my return flight all was fine, though the snack again was below expectations. Coffee however was very good.

### "friendly and professional"
Athens to Zurich. The flight was on time and the cabin crew was friendly and professional. The plane looked dated and worn inside and the seats were not that comfortable, IFE was nonexistent. But the friendly cabin Crew compensated for that. It was a 2.5 hour flight and they served a real hot meal. The food was OK, but hey, not  many airlines serve hot meals on intra-european flights these days. Communication between the flight deck and passengers almost nonexistent.

### "updated charges for sporting equipment"
Aegean Airlines have updated their charges for sporting equipment, skis in particular. The first set of skis used to be free with the purchased ticket, but from now on it costs 50 euros per trip. I consider these charges ridiculous, this is something I would expect from Ryanair or a similar low budget airline.

### "Amazing and professional"
Flew to Beirut from Sofia via Athens. All I can say that I was impressed by what this airline offers. Amazing and professional cabin staff, both flights were pleasant and everything was on point. The food they served was also much better than others can serve during flight. I won’t hesitate flying with Aegean again. I love this airline!

### "staff as always very professional"
Athens to Larnaca was a regular though very bumpy flight due to exceptionally bad weather at Larnaca, in flight staff is as always on this airline very professional, fine aircraft and  tasteless pasta on this route. Nothing to complain about and to my surprise on this route jet steps were used, something not so common on this airline. On our return flight on 23/1 under heavy rain and low temps the bus was used, plane was parked away from jetsteps and we were watching passengers trying hard to go down the stairs under the rain and then walk to the bus. This is a good airline, however they need to show more respect to their passengers as far as the jet walkways are concerned, and as a regular flyer I find that this point is negative.

### "friendly cabin Crew"
Athens to Vienna. Punctual take-off and landing, nice and friendly cabin Crew, even the meal was fine. Very low price ticket, still high quality Service, I do not like the branding of the airline.

### "overall terrible customer experience"
The delay at Schiphol airport for flight A3617 from Amsterdam to Athens due to weather conditions is something acceptable. What is not acceptable is the delay from Aegean to inform us by sms messages about the departure time. Nobody informed us that I could ask for free meals and drinks and I didn't take most of the receipts. You did send sms messages about the delay but no messages about free meals/drinks. Compensation for a 4.50 euros receipt for meals/drinks for two persons doesn't seem right. At least you didn't accept the 5 euros extended parking time which was caused by the departure delay. The total amount of money (9.50 euros) is insignificant for a company like Aegean. It's not about the money but the overall terrible customer experience which will force me to use alternative airline companies for my journeys when I can. I pay for more expensive tickets because of the quality and the trust I have about Aegean Airlines. If you can't offer more than your competitors why I should fly only with Aegean and not find cheaper alternatives?

### "service was far below expectations"
I flew from Athens to London Heathrow in Business Class. I have flown with Aegean many times before, mostly in Business Class and their service has been consistently good. On this occasion though there were problems. Aegean offer 4 free seat upgrades to their Gold flyers and 2 upgrades to their Silver flyers. This means a lot of passengers flying Business class for "free". On my flight there were 16 passengers in C class, 50% of which were free upgrades. One FA only was assigned to this cabin and as a result the service was far below expectations. The FA could not provide the service required on time or at the level it should be. For example, drinks were coming very slowly and the starter and main were served at the same time which is very unusual for Aegean on this route. By the time I finished my starter, the main was too cold. Also, passengers in C class were putting their feet up on the back of the front seat with the FA allowing it without any sort of comment. Certainly not a good experience this time. I have flown many times with Aegean, I recommend them and I consider them one of the best airlines in Europe. However, if they want to take the extra step and get another star they need to sort out some small things like these upgrades. Maybe reduce them? Do they need them for Silver members? During busy times, their C cabin needs more than one staff to keep up with the workload. I will be flying with them again soon though.

### "No information, no apologies"
There was fog at the destination airport and two or three flights before us, due to leave at 10.00 local time, were cancelled for this shuttle service. The screens never posted cancelled or delayed in any flight including ours two hours later. The screens only posted "Gate open". There were some weather announcements. In the end there was this: "Flight so and so is cancelled. Click". No information, no apologies (Aegean is by excellence the no excuses airline, have had other similar experience in the past) but worst of all, there was no info or any guidance as to what to do with our travel plans, our tickets, some sort of minimum empathy or a minor sample of the infamous Greek hospitality, Aegean claims to be the carrier of.

### "very disappointed frequent flyer"
Frankfurt to Thessaloniki. I've recently traveled with Aegean airlines where I was forced to pay an extra fee for my carry on at my connecting airport in Frankfurt. The staff was rude and spoke to me and some other passengers in a military like tone. I will never fly with Aegean airlines again. My ticket was with Lufthansa but the flight was operated by Aegean, and was told that there were Aegean regulations. A very disappointed frequent flyer.

### "Flight crew were also friendly"
I've flew Aegean Airlines very recently and was really looking forward to it, since they won an award for best regional airline. I've flown in economy class from Prague to Athens in A320 and then continued to Larnaca on an A321. Seats were comfortable in both planes and leg room was ok, but A321 had better legroom. Food was distributed really quickly and it was alright, we had pasta on one flight and meatballs on the other one, plus a snack and a chocolate bar. Drinks were also good and there was a good selection of them. Flight crew were also friendly and both flights arrived a little bit early. There was only one problem and that was that check in had be done by yourself (I do it online anyway, but some people might have problems with it). Overall it was a good experience and I would fly with them again.

### Aegean Airlines customer review
No IFE on this flight from Paris to Athens. Service okay, nice food, no on board sales. They apologize that they did not do sales due to turbulence. Departed late but arrive Athens on time. Cabin clean and friendly service.

### "an excellent experience"
I flew Aegean Airlines from Athens to Stockholm Arlanda in December. The flight was full, so the ground staff asked us kindly if we'd like to check our luggage for free. Onboard, the plane was clean and modern. We were served a full breakfast, and the flight attendants came around a lot with rounds of drinks. I really like Aegean cabin crew because they are very kind, polite and helpful. We arrived in Stockholm 30 minutes earlier, where we collected our luggage from the carousel. The only thing I'd like to mention is that most of the time Aegean does not use the jetbridges in Athens airport, even when they are available, and the passengers have to go to the plane by bus. Overall an excellent experience and for me is the best carrier in Europe.

### "decline of customer service"
Athens to Corfu. My wife and me are flying Aegean since they started and we were always fans. We fly up to 10 times and sometimes more per year with them. Since about 2 years we see a decline of their customer service and friendliness on the ground but also on board. On our last flight after boarding the aircraft a stewardess asked us if one of our duty free bag has a bottle inside in the overhead compartment. Yes, we said - she said (without 'please') that we have to put that under our seat. The bottle of champagne was even in a carton. When the aricraft started the whole bag went to the neigbour behind and so on and we were facing turbulences and had to hold that bottle - the stewardess did not even looked at us after and was looking away when we left the aircraft saying good bye to other customers. The stewardess showed an extremly unrpofessional behaviour - not only playing police and when asked for the logic reason could not answer it. We never had to do that on Aegean or any other airline - and other passengers with bottles in duty free bags on this flight also not. Not only we had 3 suitcases damaged by their ground staff 2017 - and now this - it's getting a bit too much. They offered us a cheap repair which was nothing really - lucky we have a good insurance which replaced them. I hope this gets all better again.

### "pleasant surprise for me"
Sofia to Athens. We arrived 1h.30mins. before the flight and went straight to the business class check in desk (thanks to Star Alliance Gold Status). Then we went to Preslav Lounge, where we spent a decent amount of time. We arrived at the gate, there was no priority boarding. We boarded and took our seats in row 1. Even though the aircraft was not supposed to have a business class cabin, the first row was separated by a curtain. This was a pleasant surprise for me. The plane took off on time. Snacks and drinks were distributed to all passengers. Shortly after that, we began our descend into Athens airport. The total flight time was 1 hour. We landed on time and picked up our luggage. We were soon in Athens.

### "all shovelled and squeezed like sardines"
A3 803, Munich - Athens on Dec 18th, 11.00 was the final leg of a longer trip that started in India. Time to board Aegean flight 803 comes and the relevant announcement invites first the usual group of pax (handicapped, passengers with kids, Business class and Star alliance Gold members). As the plane was parked somewhere farther on the tarmac embarkation took place by bus. So these people were the first to get on the bus and wait, until we are all shovelled and squeezed like sardines for the rather long ride to the plane. Is there a point to make any announcement offering the privilege of priority to these people, who will eventually wait longer and be cramped in the same bus with everyone else? Is this a flattering picture for an airport and airlines bragging about their awards? I am not sure if this should listed be under Aegean airlines, Munich airport or Lufthansa.

### "my luggage does not fit"
Frankfurt to Thessaloniki. The worst part is how they carry on about the luggage. The ticket just said that 2 pieces of hand luggage are allowed. However when I checked in I was told that my luggage does not fit the requirements and that I am not allowed to take airport shopping with me on board. In spite of repeated questions the woman at the gate would not say what the definition of a personal item and carry-on luggage is. There was one that wanted to ban me from boarding because I dared asked them questions or complain about the service, which other people were doing as well. I had a standard-size cabin suitcase and a small handbag. I was charged extra for this. In spite of paying extra for it, the bag was removed from me and I ended up travelling without my personal belongings. There was plenty of space under the front seat for my luggage so lack of space is not reason for this approach. Staff are generally unhelpful and take the attitude that customers have to do the work. There were people who after queuing for 30 mins to check in were told that they should have checked in prior on an e-machine. And staff who are supposed to assist with this were curt and unhelpful. The woman who was helping me started serving another customer in the midst of serving me. She then accused me that I was not entering a long sequence of numbers on the booking correctly. She was supposed to be helping me do this. An FA got angry because I asked for brown instead of white bread and I had to ask for wine twice. They said they had forgotten it. When we reached the destination people with bags a lot larger than mine were getting off the aircraft. The flight costs  too much and you get treated like you are a nuisance.

### "cabin was clean and modern"
Flew from Stockholm to Athens on Aegean Airlines. Had only cabin baggage so I went straight to the gate. The airplane was at the gate on time, but the boarding was a mess, ending up having a 20 min delay. The cabin was clean and modern. The crew was excellent, carrying out lots of rounds of services. The hot meal was nice and delicious. They also offered 3 rounds of drinks. The captain kept keeping us informed about the flight. Arrived in Athens with a 20 min delay. The only thing I would recommend is to install some sort of IFE apart from the overhead screens. I've flown Aegean a lot of times, and I would certainly choose them again.

### "provided an excellent service"
Rhodes to Rome via Athens. Excellent flights with 3/4 on time and one with twenty minutes of delay. FA's were professional with a smile and provided excellent service. Breakfast on the outbound flight and lunch on the inbound flight offered plus drinks of your choice. The tastes were excellent. Coffee and tea soon after provided. IFE system consisted of movies about Greek cities which was ok for that short flights. All in all, Aegean provided an excellent service and is always a pleasure to fly with.

### "congratulate the airline and staff"
London to Athens. My parents recently travelled with Aegean business class and I have used the service before. The service is superb and the staff well trained and very helpful. On behalf of my parents who are an old couple I congratulate the airline and staff for their support and professionalism with passengers who need help. The menu and wines from different regions of Greece deserve special recommendation.

### "has been consistently good"
Athens to London Heathrow and then onwards to Miami with another airline booked in one ticket. Check in at Athens airport was a breeze and luggage sent directly to the final destination. Flight was full and on time outbound, about 90% full and about 30 minutes delayed inbound. Boarding was orderly and the management of hand luggage in the cabin was good (not too much). Special meal was requested and it was very nice. Good service of food and drinks, included in the ticket price. Friendly and cheerful crew. I have become a regular customer and is has been consistently good.

### "delivering a very good service"
London to Athens. Excellent service, I fly Aegean regularly and service has always been meeting the same standards. The consistency in delivering a very good service over time is becoming a guarantee and deserves praise. Extremely polite staff and great in flight service. Punctual departure and arrival. Always at the best airport gates. On the negative side, the high ticket prices. Does the Athens to London route need larger aircraft or more flights per day?

### "crew was kind and friendly"
Athens to Larnaca. I did not have any baggage problem at all. Everyone has to download the Aegean app and make a miles and bonus account for special offers and upgrades! You can have all the information about your flight (gate,time etc) and your boarding pass in your hand. On the airplane now, cabin crew was kind and friendly, we departed on time from ATH. The food delicious and my seat very comfortable (7A).

### "one of my best trips"
Amazing. One of my best trips from Berlin to Athens. Very friendly cabin crew. Nice, modern and clean cabin. The food was delicious. On time arrival and departure. I was curious about the P.A (pilot announcement) if they will inform us about the flight and so they did 3 times. Before take-off at cruising altitude and before landing. I am going to fly again and again with them.

### "flights were most pleasant"
I am Gold Member of their Miles&Bonus program and needed 4 legs to renew my Gold card for another 12 months. So I decided to fly Vienna to Heraklion via Athens and back. I used my upgrade vouchers for flying in C. And as always the flights were most pleasant. First of all their stewardesses are really top. They are friendly, competent, charming and well-presented. Seat pitch and recline are perfect - I spent all 4 legs in row 1 and slept ok on some of the routes. Food and beverages were decent. The lounge in ATH is OK - not as good as other Star Alliance lounges but at least the wine selection is pretty good.

### "amazing experience"
Great experience from Krakow to Athens. Having flown mostly low-cost airlines, it was a great change to fly with Aegean. Despite the low ticket price the service was better than other major airlines I have flown with. Seats were comfortable, food was nice (had vegetarian option) and there were lots of drinks available. The cabin crew was really nice and helpful. Despite a slight delay with the departure, we landed on time in Athens. The only thing that was a bit annoying was that the queue for bag drop for people with printed boarding passes took longer than the one for people without them (I thought it was quite unusual) and I had to rush to the gate after checking my luggage. But all in all, amazing experience, would definitely recommend.

### "excellent value for money"
Flew Aegean Airlines from Bucharest to Toulouse via Athens. This is the second time in a few months that I have had superb value for money from this airline. All flights were on time - in yesterday's case, half an hour early. This airline must be one of the few in Europe which still gives you something decent to eat and a glass of wine in the afternoon. The cabin crew were friendly and attentive. However, what really impressed me was the space between seats. All flights have been a very comfortable experience and excellent value for money.

### "experience has always been stellar"
Athens to Helsinki. I've travelled with Aegean Airlines many times in the past few years. I decided to finally write a review, seeing the consistency of service - a single positive or negative experience can be attributed to chance, but I think safer conclusions can be drawn after having the same experience time after time after time. And my experience of Aegean Airlines has always been stellar. The plane was clean, in good condition (this time I flew with one of their new A320ceo - those with "sharklets" at the wing tips), inspiring reliability. The crew were friendly in a genuine way - it's amazing how easy it is to spot fake smiles - and gave the impression they truly care for the passengers. Leg room must be among the best, I've never felt squeezed in an Aegean plane. In-flight service is miles ahead of anyone else. You get a warm meal with drinks (including alcoholic ones, such as wine or beer), coffee/tea, before-take-off candy, and there were even gifts for children. I'm baffled by some people who claim Aegean's in-flight entertainment is lacking, and I applaud Aegean's decision to show instead a truly beautiful video displaying the many places worth visiting in Greece. Flight-deck crew provide information to the passengers along the way. All in all, it's hard to find any flaws. If I absolutely had to pick something, I'd say that sometimes the aisle seems a bit clogged - probably as a result of the cabin crew being busy serving passengers. I think Aegean fully deserves its "best regional airline" designation, as you get a lot of value for your money. Their prices are more than reasonable, and when you realize how much you get for what you pay, the result is totally worth it. No chance I'd fly with anyone else on my way to/from Greece

### "it was a superb experience"
Heraklion to Dusseldorf via Athens. For an intraeuropean flight it was a superb experience. After boarding a welcome drink was served on a domestic Greek flight, on international flight the menu was also handed over. After take off hot towels was given and a new round of drinks was served. The meal service is fantastic, you got a cold first course (grilled vegetables, two sorts of cheese, bread and butter, salty crackers), a second course (I could choose between a veal filet or rooster ragout in tomato sauce with local, greek pasta), I went for the veal, a little bit well done, but ok, it is reheated in an aircraft oven. The quantity was more than ok. After the main course you receive a selection of typical greek desserts. A great red wine was served (Orgion 2014). After the dessert I had an Espresso (Illy). Shortly before landing we had a second round of hot towels. The crew was outstanding and incredibly friendly and polite.

### "principally good airline"
Munich to Heraklion. A principally good airline. Warm food was served, IFE even on short routes, friendly crew, friendly ground staff. Everything okay, but the seats bring Aegean down. Just 30" pitch. That's not economy, that's cattle class. The flight turned into torture. I don't understand why Aegean Airlines risk their image by ignoring such important fact.

### "rude woman at the Tirana"
Tirana to Athens. First time flying with this airline and for the most part I was very pleased with the services. The attendants were nice and we got sandwiches and drinks included on the flight. Boarding was on time and departed on time. What I did not like was the rude woman at the Tirana check in. I had to check my bag in and I didn’t understand what she said at first because it was so quiet so she had to repeat it, which made her even happier you can imagine. I understand if you are having a bad day, but honestly just do your job and plast a smile on your face if you have to. You work in customer service and are expected to be pleasant, not really rude.

### "very good service overall"
Stockholm to Athens round trip with Aegean Airlines. I fly this airline at least 5 times a year for the last 5 years or so and it does not fail to meet my expectations (almost) every single time, be it travelling in economy or business class. This time both flight legs were of top quality, with delicious meals and very good service overall. The airplanes were clean and departures / arrivals were on time. It is always refreshing seeing people being genuinely happy in their work, and I hope that this will continue being the case with Aegean Airlines.

### "premium airline experience"
Mykonos to London via Athens. This was my first time flying with Aegean. My ticket said that the first sector would be operated by Olympic Air but that was not the case - it was on an Aegean aircraft. The first sector from JMK-ATH was very short (less than 30 minutes in the air) but the crew offered sweets before take off, then a hand wipe and a small snack. The transfer in ATH was only 40 minutes but there were "transfer ambassadors" to make this process go smoothly. The second sector from ATH-LHR was very busy but the service (from the immaculately groomed crew) was first class. There was an initial beverage service, followed by a meal/beverage service followed by hot drinks, the crew were working really hard and provided such a great service. Aegean provides a premium airline experience that is becoming hard to find in the European short-haul market.

### "late on departure both ways"
Birmingham to Athens return. Main reason I used Aegean on this route is the direct flight during Summer time as Aegean doesn't fly the route during Winter and I usually fly Lufthansa, Swiss, Austrian or Turkish Airlines throughout the year. Really disappointed to realise that the airline I was once proud of has fallen behind the competition. The aircraft was late on departure both ways of my trip. The seats are too close to each other and too narrow (30 ins pitch as LH). The food was unacceptable for a Greek airline that represents the country with the best cuisine in the world, both ways of my journey exactly the same food and each time worse that the previous one. Cabin crew professional but with attitude and poor training, Night flight and they left the lights on throughout the whole flight without dimming them, announcements were too loud and hasty (especially in English), asked for water twice and they forgot it both times. The  magazine torn from previous use. Lufthansa uses small plastic holders where they offer the magazine so it doesn't get spoiled by use. Finally inflight entertainment is absent.

### "a small warm meal was served"
On my way from Prague to Tirana I choosed to fly with Aegean Airlines via Athens. Check in and boarding went smoothly and the full aircraft departed on time. The seating comfort was normal for this type of flight. To my surprise a small warm meal was served on this relatively short flight, something we seldom see on intra european flights which nowadays only is for sale. Hot and cold beverages were offered ´with a small cake. No inflight entertainment but the captain gave inflight info over the loudspeakers. Arrival on time and transfer to the terminal. I will not hesitate to book Aegean again.

### "excellent on-board service"
Athens to London Heathrow. This is the best direct airline from the UK to Greece. Very good value fare and excellent on-board service with pre-flight sweets and during the journey, two rounds of drinks, tea/coffee separately and a hot meal. Clean A321 both ways. Flying into Heathrow was the usual stacking before the always amazing sightseeing aerial tour of London as the aircraft made its approach. I used to fly BA on this route but a large gulf has appeared in its service provision for the outer European routes: until BA substantially improves I will continue to fly Aegean from Heathrow.

### "is Europe's best airline"
Nurnberg to Thessaloniki. I almost solely fly Aegean Airlines because they offer Ryanair prices with a Lufthansa comfort and service. On medium haul flights they offer a complementary warm meal, unlike most European airlines. On short haul flights, they offer a snack and and a drink and a coffee. I´d like to add, that I once had my flight anulled due to bad weather, and they offered me a free 5* hotel stay, considering European law does not oblige airlines to offer such things due to bad weather. For me Aegean is Europe's best airline.

### "service has really gone downhill"
Flew Rhodes to Athens with Aegean. Cabin crew were rude and unfriendly as I don't speak Greek. Seat was dirty from the previous person on the previous flight. They didn't care, they just wanted to get everyone on board. No apologies. Used to love travelling with Aegean but their service has really gone downhill these last few months.

### "a very pleasant experience"
Thessaloniki to Munich. Excellent trip, on time and very good service. Business class is spacious, service friendly and thoughtful. Priority boarding and priority transfer from plane to terminal much appreciated. Good information on board, experienced pilots, smooth landing. Overall a very pleasant experience.

### "flight attendants are very diligent"
Athens to Lisbon. Perhaps due to tourist season, the ticket was expensive, more than 400 euros. All the seats on the plane full, several flight attendants are very diligent, which issued food, food was not delicious to me. The crew pushed the cart several times, for everyone to be served Drinks. The seat comfort was bad for me.

### "restored my confidence in flying"
Paris to Kephalonia via Athens with Aegean. Aegean have restored my confidence in flying again. Everything from the airports to the flights was lovely, the seats on the plane were ample for my larger than average size and no seat belt extender was needed, the cabin crew and ground staff were very pleasant. Four flights and not one delay. Ok the food wasn't really to my taste but then we don't expect a gourmet meal on a plane. Loved the little TV screens plotting the course of the plane and all the information about the flight. Appreciated the announcements on the plane by crew in English but wish they spoke a little slower. Transfer was easy although a bit long on the return trip (+5 hours) and we were advised by message of which gates to go to. Would fly with them again.

### "food main course really poor"
Excellent check in with freindly helpful staff at business desk. Lounge (Swissport) used by Aegean for London flights is dirty and appalling, why the Aegean lounge cannot be used is beyond me. The furnishings are dirty, some graffiti on seats, no clean glasses, food looks miserable and the place strewn with dirty glasses and plates. This is our second visit to this awful lounge with Aegean business class, and it is time for them to either allow access to the advertised Aegean lounge on the website or change to a better serviced lounge, as for what we pay it is not a good image for Aegean airlines. Business class were not given priority over people in economy with children on this sector of flight. Never seen this before, but again not good enough. What is going on at Athens airport, this didn't happen in London. The attendents on the flight were excellent, but the food main course were really poor, not up to your usual standards. We fly with Aegean because they are better than the rest, they need to step up, standards are slipping.

### "wait for bus to be full"
Athens to Larnaca. When loading passengers on the bus to be transferred to the aircraft, the Gold members including business passengers should be transferred separately and not wait for the bus to be full with passengers because then it defeats the purpose. WiFI is not offered by from Aegean Airlines.

### "we faced delay"
Athens to Brussels. The quality of the service is getting worse. I regularly pick this operator for my flights from Brussels to Athens and back. During my last trip not only we faced delay, but also the information provided was not accurate. They did not clearly communicate the reason of the delay and kept on stating that the flight will leave at 18.00 although it was 5 minutes later.

### "check in the hand luggage"
London Heathrow to Athens. Food of very poor quality and small quantity for the glutein free option. Boarding experience from London Heathrow was unpleasant, since ground staff asked me to check in the hand luggage that was accepted for cabin when travelling from Athens. Do not understand how they are not standard rules.

### "Good experience and service"
Zurich to Athens. Good service, no doubt. Flight on time, they smile and was for me the first time that I did fly on this airline. A good Business Class service, not only the smiles. The food was great, a great plate of Fruits and vegetables, good wines also. Good value for money to be honest. I will be back for certain. And space in the compartments to put the our bags. I appreciate the fact that on the end of the flight they send a separate bus for the Business Class. Good experience and good service even on a short flight.

### "impressed by your team"
I had a standby ticket for the flight Heraklion to Zurich and onward to final destination Frankfurt with another company. The connecting flight however was 55 minutes after arrival at Zurich. I would like to thank your ticketing/check-in staff to finding the perfect solution for me. I am very impressed by your team and will recommend Aegean Airlines to everyone. Hope to see you again soon.

### "exceeding the weight limit by 2kg"
Frankfurt to Athens. I am very disappointed in the service of Aegean Airlines. On my flight to Athens from Frankfurt I had to pay an extra fee of 60 euros to check in my cabin bag exceeding the weight limit by 2kg. I was not the only one getting this treatment. Not that the bag would have been bigger in volume than the one allowed, only it wasn’t the correct form but would have still fit the overhead compartment just fine. Also a couple of people who had bought tax free products at the airport and now had to check in their bags because the extra plastic/paper bag they were carrying also had to be in their cabin bag . The service onboard was standard and the flight arrived on time, all of which I couldn’t enjoy after the experience I had at the gate.

### "never travel this airline again"
Rome to Athens. I pre booked my seat. It was close to an emergency exit. However I did require a seat belt extender. Instead of the matter being dealt with discreetly the air hostess as loud as she could said she cannot allow me to sit there if I require an extender because it means I am not fit. No that's not the case. Regardless she then proceeded to as loudly as she could going to every person in rows behind me asking if they are alone and are willing to swop seats because I am too big to sit by the emergency exit. I have never been treated in such a disgraceful manner by an airline. To top it off I was skipped when food and drink was being offered. I will never travel this airline again.

### "I highly recommend it"
Bucharest to Heraklion via Athens. Superb flight. First when we did the check in the person let us 2 baggages even if we didn't pay for them extra fee so it will be easier for us in the plane. They had great food on board and taking in consideration that we traveled with a 1 year and 2 months baby they gave us extra care. Great Company and I highly recommend it.

### "Top level service"
Aegean is definitely one of the best airlines in Europe - no surprise they keep winning awards. Top level service, excellent food on board, amazingly friendly staff, flights leave and arrive on time, they fly to the best airports (for example, London Heathrow instead of other lower-cost London airports) and they always park at the most convenient gate. Top choice for flying in Europe.

### "staff were polite and highly professional"
Another high quality experience with Aegean flying from Athens to Berlin. All staff were polite and highly professional, and free hot meals and alcoholic beverages were offered. A thunderstorm in Berlin required a diversion to Leipzig airport for several hours, followed by storm-related problems disembarking at TXL - all handled by the staff calmly, courteously, and with frequent updates - free refreshments were also available during the delay. Some sort of inflight entertainment would have been appreciated. Would be very interested in seeing this airline provide long-haul service.

### "a pleasure to fly with Aegean"
Mytilene to London Heathrow via Athens return. As always, a pleasure to fly with Aegean. Cabin crew were very friendly, efficient and professional, plane was clean. Food was ok, it's not 5 star fine dining but much appreciated even on a 3.5 - 4 hr flight. Lovely wine. Landed early in ATH as is nearly always the case. ATH - MJT was a full flight and about 35 mins in the air with a drinks service followed by a breakfast snack service followed by coffee tea service (those cabin crew were constantly on the move and smiling). One thing that I'm not keen on is the pre allocated seating which is a pain especially if you want a specific seat (extra leg room, I'm 6' 6"). From LHR to ATH I logged on for check in as soon as it opened and there were only approx 13 other seats to select and from ATH to LHR approx 18 seats. Fortunately got an extra legroom seat on outbound but inbound had to ask an agent at the airport if a seat had become available. After a bit of tapping away she gave me extra legroom seats on both inbound flights (very appreciated). Please can we go back to selecting our own seats? Boarding is the usual chaos with no one taking any notice of the announcements (if they're boarding passengers seated at the back you can bet those with seats at the front will go through too) but it's no big deal and in no way reflects on the airline. Will definitely continue using Aegean when flying to Greece though

### "our luggage was lost"
Athens to Lemnos. I have flown Aegean many times over the years and never had an issue. However, our luggage was lost on a recent trip to Lemnos. It seems Aegean ground staff at Lemnos Airport were limited to the transparency of the situation. I will assume this part of the operation is outsourced or they have very poor communication skills or process in Athens baggage. The Aegean staff were extremely accommodating to my questions and follow ups - in actual fact, I did sympathise with them and the position they were in as there were others in a similar situation. The luggage did arrive, 72 hours later. In short, not a pleasant experience (not the lost luggage but the communication for both staff and customer). I would fly with Aegean again, provided their internal communications improve!

### "Leg space was more than average"
Flew Zurich to Rhodes. I have never been disappointed by Aegean. Online check-in process is straight-forward, with just a few clicks whereas with several other airlines you have to go through more steps. The plane was delayed for 15 min because of traffic in Zurich but the captain and the crew were updating passengers constantly. Leg space was more than average. Food was good for such a short (and inexpensive) flight. But what makes the big difference in every flight is the crew. They go beyond the formal politeness of crew members and do not hesitate to show more of their human side. It is nice to see how they speak spontaneously to the passengers, make jokes, and are very caring and enthusiastic with children. Please, keep doing the great work and you will always have your loyal passengers.

### "Delayed departure"
London to Athens. Very poor performance by Aegean Airlines on 25 July. Delayed departure but arrived Athens 3 minutes late, hot cabin, rude staff while boarding. I used to be a regular customer, but unless something changes I wouldn't recommend.

### "a very nice experience with Aegean Airlines"
Again, a very nice experience with Aegean Airlines. I was flying from Warsaw to Santorini via Athens with a layover there. First flight was very nice, left almost on time. I have pre-ordered Halal meal for this flight and I must say it was one of the best meals I have ever had. Athens airport has got a bit better from last year, so it was easy to connect there and I was also able to get some sleep at the airport. Second flight was leaving at 5.15am, the boarding via a bus was a bit chaotic but managable, flight was very short and we also received a chocolate croissant.

### "An excellent airline"
Berlin to Athens. Aegean has been my preferred airline when traveling to and from Greece. The aircraft are new, clean, and have a lot of leg space. The staff are very friendly and the food and beverage are one of the top I have had in regional flights. Flight are time never causing me delays. Also the price is very good. An excellent airline and highly recommended.

### "very well done flight"
Chania to Athens. Short flight of about an hour. Seat in 3-3 configuration with middle seat blocked out with tray. Business class cabin had just two rows. Comfortable seat with good leg space. A basket of lozenges was passed around and a newspaper (only in Greek language) offered. Boarding was a bit disorganized as we were made to wait outside the security hold area on the Tarmac side for a bus to take us to the aircraft less than 100 feet away. Once in the air, an open faced cold sandwich and drinks were served on a tray as also a hotel towel. The flight attendants were exceedingly efficient completing all the tasks in such a short period while changing their uniforms to suit specific roles - wearing cap and scarf while welcoming was on board, removing those and donning an apron to serve meals, and the again formally attired when we touched down. Flight announcements were frequent and clear in English and Greek. The view out of the window beautifully showed off the town of Chania and later on, the coasts and islands of Greece. On landing on time, long taxiing to a remote parking bay. A large bus - meant only for the business class passengers - whisked us away to the terminal. A very well done flight!

### "Everything went according to plan"
Thessaloniki to Athens on a full aircraft on a very early morning flight. Flight on Olympic Air codes, but fully operated by and booked with Aegean. Everything went according to plan. Timely departure and arrival, orderly embarkation, not too much hand luggage in the cabin, courteous staff. The service included some biscuits and one drink for a 35 minutes flight. Choice of seat without charge. Very satisfied and much better than the low cost competition (Ryanair was the same price - but you have to think of all the add ons, the attempts to sell and the tricks).

### "we would be 1 hour late"
Manchester to Athens return. Delayed at Manchester on the way there but the time was made up. On the way back we were delayed at Athens, no information on how long we would be delayed before boarding. We were only made aware that we would be 1 hour late when the captain announced the arrival time later on in the flight. At no point was the delay acknowledged with an apology.

### "not possible to get seat allocation"
Aegean Airlines is fairly new with a new fleet of A320´s. Service is generally good but unfortunately not an airline to let your kids travel alone with. I used their flight assistance service that guaranteed me that my unaccompanied girls would sit close to the the Flight Crew so they could look after them flying from Copenhagen to Athens. However, they were denied this and had to sit in the middle far away from the Flight Attendants. Even though I myself is a Gold Member it was not possible to get seat allocation in advance.

### "staff friendly and helpful "
Santorini to Athens. The flight was very pleasant. The staff were friendly and helpful and the plane was clean and well maintained. A snack and drink was served which didn't matter since the flight was so short at 45 minutes. Also the fact there was no IFE didn't matter either.

### "onboard service is good"
Milan to Athens with Aegean Airlines. Staff are very friendly and the onboard service is good. Business class seats are the usual ones, that means 3 seats together having the midle seat empty. For extra leg room, I suggest to book your seat in advance and choose the first row seats. You can book your seat in business class any time you like. Food was so so. Maybe they want to serve some Greek dishes but the result was not so tasteful. Some times I wish I had some steak with vegetables, instead of chicken cooked in various ways. Concerning the wines, they serve each month different wines from various areas of Greece. The red wine I tasted was from Cephalonia and it was excellent.

### "spacing of the seats has decreased"
I have been using Aegean Airlines for long time now, being a frequent traveler with them the last 2 years and participating in their miles and bonus program. On my last flight from Frankfurt to Athens to my surprise I have noticed that the spacing of the seats has decreased. With such a small space my knees were in the back of the front seat all the time and with the passenger in front fully reclined I ended up actually standing the majority of the flight time. On the other hand the cabin crew is always pleasant and helpful, the coplimentary food and beverage is always above average and the aircraft are clean and new. I wouldn't like to see Aegean going down the path of budget low cost airlines but their seating lately seems it goes that way. I hope my next flight with them in July wont be as bad as this one.

### "a very good economy class
Athens to Milano. I think that Aegean has a very good economy class product for short haul flights within Europe. Seat is quite comfortable and since you can book your seat 48hrs in advance using the echeckin services, you can select an emergency exit row free of charge. Lot of other airlines will charge you with 15 to 20 euros for such a seat. Then it is one of the few airlines which still serve a hot meal. For the flight between Athens to Milano other companies serve a cold sandwich. We have been served a hot breakfast plus yougurt with honey, juices and coffee. Plane departed with 15 minutes delay but we arrived on time

### "staff did everything they could"
Flew Aegean from Athens to London Heathrow. Flight departed on time. Fair quality of food. I had a low cholesterol breakfast consisted of omelete and grilled vegetables. All other passenger received a hot bread stuffed with cheese, so better to go for the low cholesterol meal. However do not ask for the fish meal, because it is awful. The plane was full however staff did everything they could to provide good service

### "Perfect service and food onboard"
We fly several times per year to Athens and the highlight of the journey is to fly Aegean. Perfect service and food onboard. Always a smile from the crew. We appreciate now especially the late return flight to Stockholm on Fridays. We also appreciate the high service level when in contact by phone. Short or no waiting time at all and perfect service. Only one proposal for a future improvement: the inflight announcements in English should be carried with no F1-speed but articulated so the message is understood! We have promoted Aegean to all our friends and family members, both in Sweden and Finland. And all have been very satisfied. Except for the above mentioned message issue. We strongly recommend Aegean. A Greek company to be proud of.

### "nice staff and very friendly with us"
Flew Aegean Airlines from Athens to Copenhagen. Absolutely perfect. Nice staff and very friendly with us. A brand new and clean aircraft with very good inflight entertainment. Lastly the food was very good and tasteful but the ticket was a little bit expensive.

### "very good experience in total"
Munich to Athens. Very good experience in total. Food not the best but still fine. Friendly Cabin crew. Brand New aircraft. A bit frustrated with the "miles and bonus" reward program. Very limited seats. Trying to book using my miles but there is no availability for 6 weeks in a row for a route with 3 flights a day. How is this possible? Also not very generous with miles. Most of the times I choose Aegean in order to collect miles but I can't use them. Don't waste even 10 minutes to apply for this as you will only collect miles and you won't be able to spend the dates you want. Only the very cheap flights are free and still have to pay the tax.

### "flight attendants nice and friendly"
This is not the first time that I've flown on Aegean Airlines. Every time I've use this airline I was satisfied. This time however from Kalamata to Lyon it might be the best flight I ever taken. I did my check-in online which went fine. The check-in line up at Kalamata airport was fine the waiting was not very long. The flight was on time and even landed at Lyon earlier than scheduled. The only entertaiment was the airline's magazine. The cabin crew was probably the best that I ever experienced. The service was amazing with a tasty hot meal on a short flight. Also the flight attendants were nice and friendly and even went the extra mile by asking me if needed anything else. Overall Aegean airline is probably one of the best short haul airlines. I would not hesitate to fly back with them even if I need to make a connection into a different city.

### "good service on board"
Milan to Athens return. Another good flight with Aegean. Nice crew, regular information from the cockpit, A321 with very good legroom, good service on board. In Athens no airbridges (why?) Things to be improved: no IFE on board, food could be better. However I have no doubts: Aegean is the best option from Milan to Athens. If they continue to mantain this quality, I will use them again.

### "Cabin crew were friendly"
Great airline, only problem was the fact that we were late at least 10 minutes both ways, from Stockholm-Athens-Chania and back home to Stockholm. Had to wait in the aircraft for up to 30 minutes after we were supposed to takeoff. Seats were ok, did not expect anything better for an economy flight. TV showed short clips from all over Greece. But on the bright side, the food was the best airplane meal I have had. I ordered lacto-ovo-vegeratian and it was great. Tasted excellent. Just plain pasta, zucchini and cheese, and back home it was an omelette with cheese. Also my friends "normal" food was very good. We were served nice treats and drinks at appropriate times. Cabin crew were friendly, but their english could be improved, or at least talk a bit slower. You could barely hear what they were saying. For example when they explained why we were late, we only understood that it was something wrong with the aircraft.

### "Very friendly crew"
Athens to Lisbon. Aegean Airlines has been the only way from Lisbon to Greece for the past year. Special meal as requested. Very friendly crew, eager to provide assistance to passengers. In flight info about the trip by the captains. Very comfortable and clean seats. No delays. If you book tickets in advance, you may find some really interesting offers. Can't wait for my next flight.

### "crew were very helpful and kind"
Larnaca to Budapest via Athens. Timing, transportation to the plane, boarding etc was all fine. Specially I was flying with a dog in cabin I was happy that I can manage it by Aegean Airlines. The crew members were very helpful and kind, the food was excellent. On the back way they changed the departure time of my flight from Larnaca to Athen. It started before 1.5 hours as in the original schedule. I received an e-mail before 16 hours the changed departure time. Unfortunately I was not able to read it due to an internet service error. So I just had a phone call before 40 minutes of departure - during I was still traveling on the Airport transfer bus to Larnaca - so I had no chance to be on time at the airport.

### "I recommend Aegean Airlines"
Athens to Istanbul in August 2016. I have flown Aegean over a dozen times over the past 3 years . I travel to Greece almost every year from Australia and one of the most enjoyable parts is the service from Aegean Airline cabin crew. I have been recently upgraded to Silver Aegean Miles + Bonus and have been given two complimentary business class upgrades that I will be using this year. I recommend Aegean Airlines to anyone who travels in and around Europe on routes offered by the Airline.

### "Crew very friendly and helpful"
Istanbul to Athens. Departure on time. Crew very friendly and helpful. They served cold snack, drinks, coffee as well as Easter treats. However the DHC 8 propeler aircraft is noisy, narrow and somewhat inappropriate for international flights. Hope they replace it soon.

### "given chocolate Easter eggs"
Barcelona to Athens. Due to the Easter season, all passengers were given chocolate Easter eggs. The flight was on time. The airplane was very clean, along with the bathroom. Hot towels with lavender scent were provided, and a welcome drink was given. The food was excellent. The seats were leather, and reclined well. The airline magazine was available to every passenger, while a tour of Greece and Cyprus played on overhead TV's. Inflight shopping was available. The crew spoke good English. One of the best flights I have even been on, and would certainly fly with Aegean Airlines again.

### " I would use this again"
Rome to Athens. Though a considerable short flight of 1.5 hours every effort from the staff to keep the tourists statisfied has been made providing a wide variety of newspapaers, beverages, etc. A really good info updating from the cockpit. I would use this again.

### "Will be happy to fly again"
Athens to Amsterdam return and both flights almost full. Aegean still maintains a lot of the elements of the full service concept, apart from the hold luggage, which is paid for. Punctual on the outward flight - the return flight was almost 1 hour delayed due to traffic and strong winds in AMS. Most flights at this airport were delayed. We had to wait a long time untli take off seated in the aircraft. You can request between many different meal options, and I requested the seafood one, which was great and also accompanied by a nice wine from the Peloponesse. Aegean consistenly has a much better level of service than most airlines. Will be happy to fly again!

### "I was pleasantly surprised"
Milan to Cairo via Athens. I was pleasantly surprised by the service onboard on my short flights (approx. 2h each). It was my first flight with Aegean. Service was quick, began offering small candies. Food was tasty, although smaller portions, but sufficient for a short flight. Good selection of drinks. Friendly staff, aircraft was clean. Only one strange thing, by transfer in Athens. If you come from the non Schengen country and continue to the Schengen countries, you must leave the transit area to public area and pass again security control and through duty free shops. Generally I recommend to fly with Aegean. Why is Aegean only 3 star carrier?

### "difficult access to bathroom facilities"
Tel Aviv to Madrid via Athens. I give kudos to Aegean for having a specific section on their booking website for indicating the disability of a passenger but it is regrettable that they don't make better use of the information provided. My wife is blind and travels with a guide dog. While US airlines are very good at making accommodations for guide dogs our experience is that European airlines have less understanding of reasonable accommodation. I recognize that Aegean does not have a typical bulkhead that allows a little more space for an assistance dog and they did block out the center seat on both flights on check in but instead of providing a seat in the first few rows of coach we were placed in row 18 and row 19 on the legs between Tel Aviv and Athens and Athens and Madrid respectively. Being right in the center of the plane meant that it was necessary to negotiate a much longer stretch of the narrow center corridor for embarkation and disembarkation and much more difficult access to bathroom facilities. The odd thing was that after completing my reservation online I called Aegean and was specifically assured that we would be placed in the first row of coach class. Obviously a wasted call because when we got to the airport we were told they had no seats set aside for us and were even unsure if they would even be able to block out the center seat on the second leg. Aegean would do well to take some lessons from Delta or American on how to handle guide dogs. The other issue I had was that the plane was way to hot!! On both flights I asked if the temperature could be lowered. I was informed that the ends of the plane were maintained at 24 degrees C which meant that the center of the plane got much hotter and they would not lower the temperature to better serve the center because they would then get complaints about the plane being too cold. Whereas if the plane is too cold a person can add additional clothing but if the plane is too hot then if one is already down to shirt sleeves ther is not much else one can take off and remain decent. Obviously this is a serious design flaw with the equipment with the equipment that is used by Aegean but perhaps they should re-examine the cabin temperature they maintain so that people in the center of the plane don't have to endure excessive heat. The overall rating I am giving is for the issues discussed above. Without these two unfortunate circumstances my rating would be an 8 or 9!

### "Aegean are clearly cutting corners"
Aegean used to be a good airline but in the last 2 years they have been adopting some low cost airline habits while keeping the fares quite high. Flight A3601 from London Heathrow to Athens. I was at the airport 3 hours before the flight but the business class check in was closed. Same thing happened again 2 months ago. I used the economy check in and after 20 minutes in the queue I was told by the airport staff that unfortunately Aegean pay to have their business class check in open for less time than all other airlines in T2 and so it would open later. Shocking! Aegean, if you can't afford to have business class check in open, do not sell business class tickets or do not fly to Heathrow. Also, when arrived in Athens, once again the A321 full with over 200 passengers and in the middle of a storm, parked at a remote stand rather than at an air bridge. This seems to be common practice for Aegean and the excuse that all air bridges are occupied is simply not true because on this occasion nearly all of them were free. Aegean are clearly cutting corners but their fares are still very high. Their level of service though has dropped significantly to the point that it will cost them passengers. At least they lost myself! Until I know that they have reached the levels they were at two years ago, I will be flying with other Star Alliance airlines only and unfortunately from now on I do not recommend Aegean.

### "aircrafts are new and clean"
Flew from Athens to Frankfurt. The aircrafts are new and clean. The crew always have a big smile and are ready to assist the passengers with any problem. The pilots are experienced and I always feel comfortable flying with Aegean. The food quality is excellent and the quantity is adequate. My first choice when I fly.

### "received an excellent service"
Hamburg to Athens. The flight was excellent, very punctual and the crew are really very friendly. I received an excellent service. A delicious meal was also offered. They offer everything for free including drinks. The crew care about you with a very warm smile.

### "recommend to use this airline"
Thessaloniki to Munich. It is the best airline I have flown and Aegean airlines respects each passeger. Flight only lasted two hours and the meal offered is not common in short flights operated by other airlines in Europe. Cabin crew is so nice. I recommend everyone to use this airline.

### "always more than professional"
Athens to Larnaca. Cabin staff is always more than professional, aircraft though not so spacious looks immaculately clean and new, and usually there is no delay. In this case there was a half hour delay, no reason or apology was given. What they call breakfast was a cheese pie practically without any cheese, completely tasteless. Once again at destination this flight was parked away from terminal using the good old bus transport system. The excuse that all jetways were full, is more of a joke.

### "cabin crew was polite"
Vienna from Athens. At the gate we were offered the option of checking in our hand luggage at our own discretion which I like. The flight was almost full and was on time. The seat space is very tight considering it is not a low cost carrier compared to other airlines from the same group (Star Alliance) but for a two hour flight its tolerable. The cabin crew was polite with passengers but you could see some friction between some of stewardesses.

### "pleasure flying with Aegean Airlines"
Amsterdam to Rhodes. It is a pleasure flying with Aegean Airlines. The crew is friendly and the service is one of those you rarely find. Aegean Airlines is a company with personality always behave its clients as it should, and I am always satisfied with its services.

### "it was well worth the price"
Very pleasant flight from Berlin Tegel to Athens. Flight was a bit more expensive than the competition, but still cheap (47EUR for a one way ticket). It was really worth though, cause the flight time was much more civilized (11.15am). The flight was about 50% full, there was plenty of space and no issues with hand luggage. Departed and arrived on time. Ordered the kosher meal, which was really great in terms of both quality and quantity. Plenty of drinks (food and drinks are included in the price of the ticket). Choice of seat also for free, so I requested an emergency exit seat. All in all, a slightly more expensive flight than the low cost competition, but taken into account the ancillary included, the food and drinks, the convenience and the flight times, it was well worth the price. Keep on the good job!

### "Cabin crew are pleasant and professional"
Flew Athens to Madrid. Aegean, in business or economy (most of my flights), is the best. Punctuality, cabin service, ground staff, call center, frequent flyer programme is excellent. I only regret that they principally fly A320 instead of A321. Cabin crew are pleasant and professional.

### "Overall excellent experience"
Athens to Frankfurt. Overall excellent experience. The flight was fully booked, but boarding was on time, fast and easy. The cabin crew was very friendly and helpful and the flight arrived on time. The only glitch is that one of my suitcases arrived broken, but that is the responsibility of the Frankfurt Airport staff and not the airline. Nonetheless, Aegean offered me a new suitcase for replacement for free.

### "staff smiling and very friendly"
Athens to Milan with Aegean Airlines. Excellent flying experience. Despite the flight being full (and overbooked, however they asked for volunteers to be booked on the next available flight, get compensation and a free ticket) they boarded everyone with small delay and landed us on time. Seat, I was on 2F, clean and very comfortable, featuring excellent legroom space. Staff smiling and very friendly. Meal was a great surprise. They offer a tasteful first and second course, with options and selections of traditional food from various regions in Greece. Wine list was also good. The dessert was a delicious cake served with greek yoghurt.

### "seats were comfortable enough"
I travelled  from Mytilini to Athens and it was one of the best flights I Have had, with a smooth landing. The seats were comfortable enough. Food was served, even though the flight was only 45 minutes. Aegean Airlines manages to provide better services than other bigger airlines even in shorter routes. Definitely deserves 4 stars.

### "very good overall experience"
Paris to Athens, on a new A320 with sharklets. The plane was clean inside and very quiet. Soon after take-off, we were offered a selection of drinks and newspapers, and a warm towel. After that, I was served a Greek delicacy, namely, rooster braised in red wine sauce, accompanied by noodles and some greens. Having finished my meal, I took another drink, and soon after we were less than an hour away from our destination. We landed on time. Very good overall experience. I enjoy flying Aegean.

### "stressless and comforting experience"
Athens to Warsaw return, with a group of friends, on seperate bookings. Aegean Airlines still maintains a lot of elements of the old airline service industry. Online check-in with selection of seat available, however the choice of seat varies, depending on the booking class of the ticket and/or any frequent flyer status. Both flights 80-90% full on economy. They charge for checked luggage, but they do allow check in hand luggage, so that the cabin does not become too cramped, which we did. Food was more than satisfactory - on the return flight I had requested a seafood meal which was superb (in combination with a very nice local white wine). There are options to request about 7 or 8 different types of meals depending on dietic preferences. Crew were very polite and very professional. All flights on time. Bridge used 3 out of 4 times. Flying Aegean is normally a stressless and comforting experience and this time was no exception.

### "Cabin crew service remains top class"
Cabin crew service remains top class. In an age where most airlines across Europe are abandoning inflight service, Aegean crew made at least three runs delivering drinks. The hot meal served (pastitsio) was superb, together with Greek salad and Greek desert. We were also welcomed on board with a gift-wrapped pomegranate as a lucky charm for the New Year. The plane was new and spotless. The flight was on time. Aegean crew are to be congratulated for their warm welcome and hard work throughout the four hour flight. Flying Aegean is always a treat!

### "polite, warm and willing"
Athens to Rome with Aegean Airlines. The attendants were extremely polite, warm and willing to help while there were also christmas tricks for the children. The food however the last two times I travelled has changed to smaller portions and lower quality. In older times the food of this airline was exceptional! I suppose is the competency of other low cost airlines. In addition the online check-in appears the whole plane to be full and you have no seat choice. I dont know then why to check in online before?

### "would recommend Aegean"
I flew 4 sectors with Aegean Kiev to Heraklion via Athens and then to Belgrade. The level of service is consistent. Warm meal served on the flight from Kiev (2 hours). Candies distributed before departure which is a nice touch and certainly doesn't cost much. Legroom is better than Air Serbia due to thin seats. On the flight to Belgrade we were served a sandwich which was at least twice bigger than its competitor on the route, but as much lower in quality. It was basically a bread-bun. All in all I would recommend Aegean, the main downside being the ATH airport which is very unfriendly and has no proper space or rest areas for long-transits. Polite and attentive crew. Attention to detail and consistent service. No IFE, nice legroom and a good meal on longer flights. Boarding in ATH 80% of the time being done at remote stands like low-cost carriers, even in cold and windy weather. Luggage policy seldomly applied, at some stations strict one-bag policy as Wizz Air / Ryanair, at others no one pays attention. No proper business class. Poor quality meal on shorter flights. ATH airport makes Aegean unattractive as a transit airline making for poor transfers if the wait time is longer than a few hours (very frequent in winter). Reaching Athens to spend a night can also be very expensive and time-consuming (distance to the city being 45 kilometers).

### "cabin crew are distant, indifferent"
Athens to Paris CDG with Aegean Airlines. 48h prior to departure passengers receive an email which encourages them to check in online so that they can choose their seat, free of charge. However, even if you try the online check-in in the very first minute of these 48h, the seat map of your flight will appear full and you won’t be able to change your allocated seat. This is a constant situation for more than a year now and it affects even passengers with flexible fares. The call centre, unable or unwilling to help, simply confirms their practice of “preseating” which does not allow you to seat next to a friend or colleague with whom you don’t share the same book reference. The experience at Aegean drop-off check-in in ATH is awful, especially if your flight departs between 8:00 and 10:00 a.m. Cabin crew members are in general distant, indifferent and not necessarily polite enough. Service on board is average. Instead of caring for the comfort of all their passengers, Aegean are crawling to families (“Aegean for families”). Therefore, avoid this airline, unless you’re travelling with kids. This must be the only chance you have to get a decent service from them.

### "service is very professional"
Athens to Larnaca. It seems that this airline does not like passenger walkways in and out of the terminal on this sector, because bus tranport was used. Arriving at Larnaca, space was available but we had to enjoy bus ride to the terminal. Inflight service as always is very professional, brand new A320, punctual flights, but despite the fare, breakfast was below expectations. Not to mention the high cost of a suitcase for such a short flight.

### "crew were professional and well groomed"
As usual a very pleasant experience with Aegean flying from Athens to Paris. Modern, clean aircraft, good food. Aegean is one of the few remaining airlines that serves a hot meal, which is much appreciated and deserves to be applauded. The crew were professional and well groomed, on both legs. On the return flight from Paris I requested a newspaper when boarding, which was brought to my seat after they were distributed to business class passengers. This was excellent service from the flight director from whom I requested it. Wi-Fi was available on this flight, but I could not log in for some reason. In-flight entertainment needs to be improved. At least some music. Overall, I always look forward to flying with Aegean.

### "a great flight as usual"
Rome to Athens, and a great flight as usual on Aegean Airlines. The flight took of slightly off schedule but landed on-time. Inflight meal was good but not enough of a portion for longer flights. Flight attendants helpful and nice, some were helping passengers with cabin-luggage stowage which is very nice. Cabin luggage policy was not strict which is appreciated. The cabin was very clean, something always consistent on Aegean. Best of all are the prices; Aegean offers great value for money while retaining higher standards of service. Keep it up Aegean. One suggestion is, Aegean should either introduce inflight Wifi or personal entertainment monitors. This would make their flights less dull and boring.

### "overall experience was great"
Amsterdam to Athens with Aegean Airlines. I never flown this airline before and my expectations weren't very high. By luck I flew on a new plane including sharklets. Once airborn the stewardess was serving a hot-meal with cold or warm beverages. It was suprising to me because It was only a 3-hour flight. After a smooth ride we landed right on schedule in Athens. My overall experience with Aegean was great and I look forward to flying with them again.

### "consistently the pride of Greece"
Flights from Athens to Paris and from Paris to Ioannina via Athens. The cabin crew was attentive, smiling and courteous. Aircraft seats and toilets were clean. In my opinion in-flight meals need some upgrade even with a fee for economy class passengers. They lack in variety and quantity. Bar-tea-coffee service was excellent. From Athens to Ioannina flight was smooth and comfortable aboard the Olympic air Bombardier Q400 turboprop aircraft. Cabin attendants wonderful once more. I think that both Aegean and Olympic air are consistently the pride of Greece amid all our pessimism and depression.

### "very pleased with the treatment"
My last flight with Aegean was as pleasant as the previous ones. Due to my Miles & Bonus Gold card, my travel companion and I were complimentarily upgraded to Business Class, with a tasty meal and several rounds of excellent Greek wine. Return flight was announced as cancelled due to a strike of air traffic control. As the company was not to be reached on the phone or at the airport, and as we absolutely had to be back home on the planed day, we had to endure a return from Athens to Switzerland via following routing: taxi to Patras, ferry to Bari (Italy), rental car from Bari to Rome, then a flight from Rome to Geneva. Apart from the length of the trip (30 hours in total), all this cost us several hundred Euros. At our surprise and satisfaction, Aegean Airlines did reimburse us all these expenses. We were very pleased with the treatment of our case and will definitely fly again with Aegean.

### "kind cabin staff service"
Berlin to Athens with Aegean Airlines. Very good and kind ground and cabin staff service. The seats are comfortable with a lot of space between the seats and the rows. Foods is delicious. You can try Greek traditional food. Personally I think that is a big plus for Aegean Airlines because in most of European airlines you have to pay on board for food and beverages - even for a glass of water.

### "food and beverages are basic at best"
Milan to Athens with Aegean Airlines. A normal flight with normal conditions. Departed on schedule, arrived likewise. Being a short haul flight the onboard food and beverages are basic at best. Correct English of flight attendants is a plus. It is the only direct flight from Milan to Athens.

### "my new favourite airline "
I flew Stockholm to Athens return and Athens to Santorini and Cairo to Athens. All flights on good time. Great meals on board included in ticket price, which surprised me as most intra-continental flights at most have a simple snack/sandwich included. Nice staff overall. Seats were decent, I didn't need to stand up at any point during flights. My new favourite airline in Europe!

### "avoids the use of terminal walkways"
Athens to Warsaw with Aegean Airlines. Being a regular flyer especially on routes where I have little or no choice of carrier, I feel that this airline avoids the use of terminal walkways - for reasons that anybody can guess - and chooses the use of good old tiring busses as if we are in the 50s. This I have experienced on many flights on Aegean from Larnaca, Munich, Madrid to name but a few. This was again the case for my recent flight both ways to and from Warsaw. Good old bus at Athens airport and then into a semi-dark ground floor in an airport which has no moving walkways for pedestrians and you have to walk from one end to the other. This bus service can happen on any airline but on Aegean it's probably my hard luck or the system. What they called breakfast was an ugly little spinach pie and coffee, on the return flight however, dinner was good. The plane as always looks clean and tidy though the inflight magazine looked horribly overused. The flight was smooth and punctual, and what I have always appreciated is the professionalism of cabin attendants, they are more than willing to help.

### "seats small and uncomfortable"
Thessaloniki to Stockholm via Athens. Aegean Airlines is an airline with high cost to value. I found the seats small and uncomfortable and there is lack of inflight entertainment. Food bad and portions pretty small. There is no onboard wifi and overhead screens play advertisements. Also, cabin lights were mostly on during this short flight.

### "brings the joy of flying"
Chania to Tehran via Athens. Aegean brings the joy of flying back into the air! The tray service offering warm tasty food on short-haul flights is just amazing. Flew on it from Europe to Tehran and back recently and it was a wonderful experience of Greece in the air. All the FA's were nice, smiling and enthusiastic about their work. The hub at ATH also very comfortable and clean.

### "all in all a fantastic experience"
Athens to London Heathrow. Best mid-haul flight I've taken in years. Seats were very comfortable, and we had more leg room in a regular economy seat than in paid exit row seats I've taken on other airlines - good news as my partner and I are both very tall. We were offered a sweet on take-off, drinks throughout the flight and a free meal - all rarities these days. My only criticism would be that the handing out of food seemed quite chaotic - staff walking up and down the plane distributing meals in a seemingly random pattern. But all in all a fantastic experience.

### "experience more than positive"
London to Athens. I flew business class (first time on an international flight. Flight was on time and the aircraft was clean. Cabin crew was friendly, confident with a genuine smile. There is no need to say much related to legroom, as the space was more than enough. Pre-flight drink was offered with option to choose among water, orange juice or sparkling wine. The three course dinner (with 2 main courses to choose from) was delicious. There was a range of different coffees to choose. So far my experience with Aegean has been more than positive. It is a reliable company and its cabin crew know how to make each flight enjoyable. Furthermore offers a good quality vs price relationship.

### "child non-friendly airline"
London Heathrow to Athens. I can say this is the most child non-friendly airline I've been on. I travelled with my 60 year old mom and my 16 month old daughter. I had thought we'd either get some help or at least some priority, but staff were not interested in in helping out. When we were trying to manage our luggage in the overhead compartments we just got blank stares. I would highly not recommend this airline for any family, and to think they pride themselves for their family services.

### "experienced the effect of strike"
My experience with Aegean airlines has been very bad. I had a trip from Milan to Rhodes via Athens return in October - I experienced the effect of strike called for 9 october 2016. Flight canceled. No warning of the incoming strike, so no time to find a re-route accomodation. On-line check-in forbidden for my flight without explanation. I just arrived on thodes airport for check-in, 8 oct afternoon, and the ground staff told me my next flight from to Milan was cancelled. No willing to help, just address me to a mile-long queue for finding an exchange flight. Aegean call a strike, doesn't warn its customer and they believe it is normal, so no reasons to complain. She answered that "it happens". If this was not enough, flight started with 1 hour of delay. Arrived in Athens, I spent all night in queue with hundreds of angry people waiting for the ticket office of Aegean to find solutions. Strike was recalled, but my flight remained canceled anyway. So after almost 6 hours of queue, I found a solution adding a stopover at Vienna through Austrian airlines. I had to sleep in a hotel and staff member ensured me that taxi trip should be offered by them, but after writing to customer service and having no answers about I can say it was no true. I came back home 10 hours later than expected.

### "good service onboard"
Milan Malpensa to Athens return. Flights on time, aircraft clean with very good legroom. Nice to receive a hot meal and beverage. Good service onboard and nice crew. Among many lower fare companies, Aegean stands for a good relationship between quality and price. I'm looking forward to fly them again.

### "makes flying a joy again"
Second time flying with Aegean in the last 3 months from London Heathrow to Mytilene via Athens and must say I will fly Aegean every time I fly whereever possible. Find Aegean 10 out of 10 from the ground staff checking you in to the the cabin crew back to the ground crew at final place. All flights on time (including connecting and return flights) well looked after on all with drinks and meals makes flying a joy again.

### "I would recommend this airline"
Athens to Geneva. I've flown on Aegean Airlines before and never had any problems. I did my check in online but I couldn't complete it as I had a booking on stand by. The waiting for the check in Athens airport was not very long and it was very reasonable. I asked to tag my bag to my final destination because I had a different booking to Montreal with Air Canada which is a partner airline. The system didn't let it even if the check in lady try to do so. Probably because my booking was on stand by. However she put a priority tag on my bag which ended to come out fast in Geneva. The flight was quite full with very few seats left. The cabin crew was not very interacting with passengers. The service onboard was good and a hot meal was provided with a choice of drinks all free of charge. The inflight entertaiment was a video featuring some tourist attractions of some Greek islands. Overall Aegean airlines is a good and it offers a good range of destinations but they're limited only to Europe and some destinations to the Middle East. I would recommend this airline.

### "reliable, efficient, modern"
I fly Aegean Airlines twice a month on a regular basis as part of my commute from France, where I work, to Greece where my home is. All things being relatively equal, from all available carriers on the Paris-Athens route, A3 is definitely my airline of choice. A few random things, which I'd like to emphasize: 1) Cabin crew are impeccably behaved and presented and always ready to accommodate my requests. 2) Air-fi which was provided on my last flights is quite interesting and compensates for the lack of individual screens in the cabin. I only hope that its content will be constantly updated and enriched (it would be a disappointment, if on my next flight in 10 days I'd be obliged to browse through the same material again) 3) Reserving front W.C. only for business class passengers (typically 8-12 per flight, which is on or about 5% of the plane's seating capacity) does not make a lot of sense and occasionally creates lots of discomfort to economy class passengers. Without undermining the premium service afforded to business class passengers, Aegean could consider a derogation to this policy. 4) As a miles and bonus silver member, I'm looking forward to upgrade to the golden tier soon. As a silver member however, I believe that A3 should reconsider silver tier's benefits and in particular the coupons for complimentary access to business class lounges so that they are offered not only in Greek airports but also to int'l ones as well. All in all my experience with Aegean has been positive since it's reliable, efficient, modern and has by far the most pleasant and professional cabin crew. The few downsides to my A3 experience are merely minor improvement challenges.

### "very good experience with Aegean"
Lille to Athens return with Aegean Airlines. The outbound flight was great, I was offered a nice meal and a great white wine. The inbound flight was a morning flight, so there was no wine, but the meal was very nice, some kind of spinach/tomato pie accompanied by a large yogurt with honey and a bun with some cheese and butter. Unfortunately, the inbound flight was quite bumpy (from Croatia until across the Alps), and the service got suspended at some point. The fact that I was returning from vacation did not help fully enjoying the flight either, as I was quite miserable. All in all, very good experience with Aegean, (I fly them regularly from Paris), and the planes were also clean and comfortable.

### "enjoyable and rare experience"
Return flight from Vienna to Athens (then connecting onwards on Olympic Air). Fantastic airline, starting from the easy booking process, smooth web checkin and opportunity to select reasonable seats without being hit with all manner of surcharges. At the airport there were short and swift queues to drop off luggage followed by timely boarding and on-time departures both ways. Onboard, greeted by pleasant, elegantly dressed hostesses, sweets for take-off, full meal with bar service tea and coffee. Overhead TVs showed the moving map with on-time arrivals on both flights. All in all a very comfortable, enjoyable and rare experience!

### "we were perfectly looked after"
I flew with Aegean Airlines back home after my recent holiday in Mykonos. As a Miles & Bonus Gold Member I was upgraded complimentary to Business Class on the Athens - Geneva leg, which was wonderful. We were perfectly looked after by the Maitre de Cabine, who served us a delicious meal and tasty wines. Transit in Athens was quick and painless, without additional security check. The only thing that Aegean could improve would be to have a separate counter for Gold Members at Mykonos airport, as it was not very appreciable to have to queue for bag drop during 10-15 minutes.

### "with professionalism and charm"
London to Mykonos via Athens, return. Efficient and quick check in at LHR Terminal 2. Boarding process was handled by non-Aegean ground staff and was badly organised and scrappy. Met at door by polite and immaculate looking crew with a smile and warm greeting. Take off was 40 min late, with drinks service shortly after. Good selection of soft drinks plus a small bottle of red or white wine for the meal. Hit some bad turbulence just as the meal service started so the captain illuminated the fasten seat belt sign and made an announcement that the service was suspended. This went on for most of the flight. The crew managed to check the cabin to ensure that passengers were ok which was very commendable, considering how bumpy the flight was. The turbulence subsided about an hour from landing at Athens and the crew recommenced the full meal service, understanding that time was against us. All trays and cups were cleared with 10 minutes left before landing. We landed at Athens 50 minutes early. Full marks to the crew who handled a very difficult situation with professionalism and charm. They never appeared stressed and were a comforting sight for many uneasy passengers. The Captain kept us informed throughout and made a soft landing. Well done to all. A great flight apart from the bumps and great food too.

### "amazing, warm experience"
Flew from Prague to Heraklion direct, which was a nice thing to discover as I normally fly back to Crete via Athens. Not the first time choosing Aegean Airlines, but again an amazing, warm experience with them. Very convenient departure time, new, clean and modern aircraft. From the moment you step on the plane you feel the warmth of the Greek hospitality. I think one of the strongest aspects is their cabin crew. They are always smiling, they look really confident, approachable and that they are really enjoying their job. I am happy to discover that they are expanding their routes with more direct flights to Europe. Looking forward to fly with Aegean again.

### "offer a consistent level of good service"
Airport staff at Düsseldorf airport were friendly and accommodating however, the check-in and bag drop counters were not opened until 3 hours before the flight and they took a lot of time to actually open the counters. That being said however, they were very efficient and fast. Moving on, the seats on both flights were comfortable and just ample for the regional midrange operations of the company, but the lack of on-board entertainment was evident. The food despite tasting good, was of very small portions and the fact that no hot beverages were served on the Düsseldorf-Athens 3 hr leg was not appreciated. Athens airport is nice, easily navigable and efficient however, a layover longer than three hours will be boring and food options were not enough. Duty free and shopping options were very broad and rather time passing. The flight attendants were all very nice. Aegean airlines offer a consistent level of good service and always have good prices from Jordan. Keep it up Aegean.

### "overall a high quality airline."
Paris to Athens in August. I was upgraded into business class which was very nice touch (LH status). The legroom was enough, the food was adequate (even though there was no much choice) and the cabin crew were attentive. There is no inflight entertainment as the promotional video about Greece was shown throughout the flight. We arrived on time and luggage delivery was super-fast which was excellent after 3 hours flight. Overall Aegean is a high quality airline.

### "would recommend without hesitation"
Athens to Tbilisi in August. Athens airport is very easy to navigate with supportive ground staff. I was surprised that no priority boarding enforced by Aegean airlines (boarding started for everyone at the same time). Onboard I found the economy cabin to be very clean with modern cabin. The legroom was ok. Cabin crew did good job and were attentive to all passengers. Hot meal was served which is really good point but the quality of the meal was below average (baked pasta with meat). Overall, this was good flight but the meal service in economy class could be improved especially in comparison with Turkish Airlines or Lufthansa (on routes from Europe to Georgia). I would recommend Aegean airlines without hesitation as it is very reliable regional airline.

### "once again excellent experience"
Flew last week from Athens to Corfu with Aegean Airlines. Once again excellent experience, professional and friendly crew, clean aircraft and on time departure. We also received a snack and a beverage on a 40-minute flight. IFE was OK, as a route map was shown. The seat is so comfortable with a big amount of legroom. Its definitely value for money as I paid for return flight, on high season, 60€ only. I would recommend Aegean.

### "Overall, very good performance"
We flew from Athens to Paris via Thessaloniki. Both flight were on time. The cabin was new and clean for the two flight. Cabin crew were efficient and smiling. We received a hot breakfast and during the flight, the captain gave us flight information. Overall, very good performance. Will definitely fly them again.

### "friendly and courteous staff"
Stuttgart to Thessaloniki with Aegean Airlines. Friendly and courteous staff, good food and beverage offer (choice, taste, composition) and great service! Always my pleasure!

### "was a very enjoyable experience"
Flew from Heraklion to London Gatwick. The first thing that impressed me was the size of the legroom available. It was much more than we were expecting. I was in the same row of a particularly tall man and he was able to stretch and cross his legs comfortably. It was certainly helpful with storing our bags and stretching out. The crew cabin were professional and helpful and the food was nice if a bit stingy on the olives in the Greek salad (just one!). What the flight needed was an option for some decent IFE as all we got was a travelogue of Greece which made us sadder as we loved Crete and we didn't want to leave! Also some Wifi service would have also been a good idea for the flight. Will fly with them again if we get the chance as it was a very enjoyable experience.

### "making me enjoy flying again"
London Heathrow to Larnaca. First time we flew with Aegean a family of 2 adults, 1 teenager and 1 child. We were very impressed. I am a nervous flier and was very sceptical to fly with them my travel agent said they're very good and not to worry. He was right. The crew are so friendly and reminds me of how it was to fly as a child they give you a sweet before take off, a cute pilot badge for the kids and the creme de la creme is the hot meal no one gives a meal these days what a lovely touch, and the many rounds of drink they offer is awesome - the only thing they could improve on is the time of the outbound flight and they really could do with some in flight entertainment. Thank you for making me enjoy flying again.

### "when you get lucky, you get lucky"
Always happy to fly with Aegean Airlines. Flew from Brussels to Athens. Very professional, flight on time, good food on board, clean aircraft, and I was happy to see a male cabin crew for the first time. Inflight entertainment should be improved. Most people nowadays do have a tablet, mobile etc but they should at least try to have different videos. Ticket price? 68 euro. You dont get that every day but when you get lucky, you get lucky.

### "very comfortable seats and cabin"
Flew Aegean Airlines from Heraklion to Copenhagen. Very comfortable seats and cabin. Able to fly for 3½ hours non stop, with excellent customer service, tasty meals and lots of free beverages. Friendly cabin crew, always smiling and service-minded. A nice welcome with a candy, meal, unlimited free coffee/tea/water. Excellent.

### "food tasted really good"
My flight to London was a wonderful experience. The seat, made of leather, was really comfortable. The food tasted really good, and it reflects greek gastronomy. The staff were happy to serve with a smile. The only thing I didn't like about the flight is the IFE. In our 3,5 hour flight, a promo film about Greece was playing on the first two hours and the a map was been showed. No one could manage to watch a two hour film about all the islands, mountains, cities of Greece. A map at the whole flight would have been better, so passengers could have a quick look of what they are watching outside their window. Overall Aegean is a high quality airline.

### "great service"
Arrived at the excellent Athens Airport after an uncomfortable and unpleasant flight on Swiss. Aegean Airlines check in was busy but nearly all desks were manned so queuing time was minimal. Check in was polite and professional with boarding gate and directions explained in perfect English. Very clean looking A320. Welcomed on board by immaculate looking cabin crew with a ready smile. Engaged with passengers as we boarded which was nice, especially children. Offered baskets of sweets pre-take off. Nice touch. On time departure. No drinks as short flight but individually wrapped biscuits offered to each passenger with a napkin. Again, nice touch. Perfect English announcements given by Purser and Captain during flight, landed early. Great service. Aegean deserve to be awarded 4 star status. Inflight mag is full of lovely pictures of Greece.

### "seats were more than comfortable"
I flew with Aegean Airlines on May 2016 from Milan to Athens. Honestly speaking the price was the same as with Ryanair for the same route (but from a different airport) however I could check in 20kg so obviously I chose Milan–Malpensa, since I am from those who believe that when you fly you want to have comfort. Aegean Airlines has friendly staff, free in cabin beverages and food (for a 1 30 h flight). On top of that the flight was on time and the seats were more than comfortable. Since I drink a lot of water I kindly asked for a few times water which was provided to me without second thought. On the negative side, I would expect in the future to have in flight entertainment such as a personal TV screen and Wifi connectivity. Aegean Airlines during the summer connects a lot of international passengers to the Greek Islands and I think from next summer they should consider doing it. (For example Air Canada has personal screens for its passengers from flights such as Toronto-Ottawa). One final note, its Blue magazine is amazing and who ever reads it can discover the beautiness of Greece.

### "did a great job on this flight"
Thessaloniki to Frankfurt. Aegean Airlines did a great job on this flight. They allow boarding the busses directly from their lounge at Thessaloniki airport which saves time and hassle for business and FQT passengers. Otherwise their Thessaloniki lounge is nothing special, they definitely need more toilets and its quite remote and not easy to find. Their staff, however, both on the ground and in the air, was very friendly. The cabin looked spotless clean and their catering was just delicious. Three course meal with 3 main courses to choose from, two regular choices plus a monthly special, which i chose: Rooster ragout in sweet wine sauce with greek pasta. No special business class seating, but normal economy seats with the middle seat left free for extra space. During the flight they showed some travel magazines on their video screens as a kind of inflight entertainment. I've flown Aegean Airlines now a couple of times and they never disappointed me.

### "a sincere smile and impeccable manners"
Mykonos to Athens. Very busy check in at Mykonos Airport but handled with a smile and courtesy. On time departure on very clean A320 both inside and out. Cabin crew were immaculate. Elegant, spoke perfect English and service with a sincere smile and impeccable manners. Short flight so only an individually wrapped cookie. Captain gave good announcements and landed early. Aegean Airlines deserve to be awarded 4 star status. They are better than bigger airlines.

### "food and drink selection superb"
Vienna to Heraklion via Athens with Aegean Airlines. The bording procedure was very efficient and the welcome drink - a glass of champange - was served with a genuine smile. The food and drink selection was superb and I was quite astonished that a range of different coffees (from espresso to cappucino) was available even on the (very) shorthaul flight from ATH to HER. Likewise, the quality of the meals and beverages met my expecations fully. It has to be mentioned that the crew was doing an outstandingly good job and also cared for little details which made me feel mostly welcome as a passenger. The planes were punctual and the priority disembarking worked remarkably well on both flights. Overall they provide an excellent product and I am looking forward to fly with Aegean again.

### "aircrafts new and clean"
Copenhagen - Athens return with Aegean Airlines. Both flights on time. Aircrafts new and clean. Seats a bit thin but comfortable. Good legroom for the European standards. No IF entertainment. Overhead screens display promotional videos of Greece. On CPH-ATH leg we were served a warm meal which was delicious. 3 rounds of drinks to choose between 2 types of red wine, 2 types of white wine, beer, juice, sodas and lots of coffee and tea. Return flight same good. A very tasty warm breakfast was served including yoghurt with honey. Lots of drinks again but not alcoholic as it was a morning flight. But what really made the difference on those flights was the genuine smile of the crew who really seemed to enjoy their job. I would definitely use this airline again when flying to Greece.

### "crew members were all very professional"
Flew last month from Athens to Geneva on an A320. I had already mobile checked-in via the very good mobile app. Ground service was excellent in Athens airport. Even though the flight was fully booked we departed on time. Cabin crew members were all very professional, very friendly and seemed to enjoy what they do. On a 2.5 hour flight we were served with a hot meal, including pasta, salad, crackers and a tasty lemon pie. Lots of drinks were complimentary (even alcoholic). In the monitors above there was a route map and a promo video for Greece. Even if there is no other IFE, it's OK as it's a short flight. We arrived in Geneva on time. I would recommend Aegean for their excellent service, their kindness and their punctuality. For me is one of the top-notch airlines in Europe and I prefer among other airlines that operate the same route.

### "I was very impressed"
Flew London Heathrow to Naxos via Athens. This was the first time I have flown with Aegean and I was very impressed. Check in at Heathrow was speedy and painless and all the staff were helpful and smiling. The plane was clean and new, food and service excellent and staff really seemed to enjoy their job. The return journey was as good. I will be flying this airline again if they are on my route.

### "friendly and kind crews"
Rhodes to London Gatwick via Heraklion. No line at check in, lovely warm welcome from agent. Both flights boarded efficiently and had friendly and kind crews. Lots of drinks and nice food with genuine feeling of Greek hospitality. Loads of leg room for a tall Brit like me. On time throughout. Highly recommended. So preferable to the shambolic, unprofessional and very uncomfortable flight I had on British Airways in other direction.

### "smooth and easy with no fuss"
First time flying with Aegean with connecting flights at Athens to Lesbos and was unsure what to expect but must say that the moment we had first contact at check in we was greeted by friendly staff who told us that we don't have to worry about bags as next time we see them will be at our final point for picking up. The flight itself was very old school with free drinks and free meal served by warm staff which was a really nice touch and made the flight go smoothly. Connections at Athens airport was smooth and easy with no fuss and second flight to our final destination was just as smooth. Return flights at end of the were the same good service. Flying same route in September with Aegean (already booked) with views of booking again in October.

### "fantastic service on-board"
Flew Munich to Athens via Thessaloniki. Aegean Airlines is an example for all european economy-class carriers. Clean and modern cabins, very professional and friendly crew, fantastic service on-board. There is no IFE, but as the average flight between Germany and Greece is about 2 hours, you don't need one. Aegean promotes in the best way Greek cuisine and hospitality. A fantastic breakfast, with Greek yoghurt with honey, a tiropita (cheese-pie), and a wide choice of complimentary drinks (also alcoholic). Even if I have to pay more than other carriers, Aegean is my top choice.

### "I would fly with them again"
We booked with Aegean Airlines for Santorini so we would avoid the summer craze. The website is very easy to use, automatically provided in Italian when accesing it from Italy. Checked smoothly and speedy from Rome. Cabin was new and seemed to be clean, seats where standard ones that you would find in the likes of Lufthansa. Warm meal was provided which I found to be very tasty. My boyfriend had his kosher meal served to him as he specified on the website. The highlight of the trip would be the stewardesses that seemed to be happy to be there, I have flown with them another two times and I have to say that they are more attending and serviceable than any other major european airline I have flown. Magazines were waiting for us on the seats which can be keeping company to solo flyers as there is no other in flight entertaiment provided. Drop screens show the route the plane takes and some weather information on the destination, as well as some promotional videos of Greece. Arriving in Athens we borded the second flight quickly and we were on our way to Santorini. Same story there with all the goods from the FCO to ATH flight minus the meal. I would fly with them again in the future as we visit the Greek islands often.

### "enjoyed the comfort"
Athens to Zurich. I had already flown business with Aegean Airlines once and I really enjoyed the comfort and the service. The second time was as good as the first one. Priority boarding worked very well, crew was welcoming and caring. I was impressed by the attention to details - when people were boarding and walking up the stairs of the aircraft, the flight attendant noticed a mother with a baby at the end of the queue and she immediately reacted and gave priority to them. Crew had a genuine smile and was attentive. The captain provided information on the flight and the destination several times. The food was delicious (sea food special meal: asparagus salad with tuna as a starter, sea bream and grilled vegetables as a main dish with a very good selection of drinks and sweets). I had one request concerning my "miles and bonus" account and asked for help through the online contact form. I received a detailed e-mail in addition to a phone call and the issue was solved immediately. Aegean is being consistent for years now with their excellent service as an airline and I hope that they will keep up like this in the future.

### "met every expectation"
Tel Aviv to Rome via Athens with Aegean Airlines. Cheap price, comfortable seats, pleasant crew, comfortable flight. Truthfully this airline met every expectation and I would happily fly them again.

### "business class food delicious"
Last December I had a flight from Heraklion to Warsaw through Athens with Aegean Airlines. Food in business class was delicious and service excellent. Ground Staff were polite and flights were on time. The only complaint I had was with some flights within Greece. Many passengers take with them onboard not only their handbag, but 2 or 3 bags, it can be very slow to stand and wait for them to store their bags. On long distance flights (Athens-London, Athens-Moscow etc) I would like improvements in the in-flight entertainment and larger food portions.

### "it was a pleasant flight"
Zurich to Athens, and once again it was a pleasant flight with Aegean Airlines which I prefer over other alternatives. To start with mobile check-in, very quick and easy to navigate (on website) process. Boarding was smooth, crew genuinely friendly and professional. I like the fact that they are flexible in terms of providing this "extra" service when asked for, even for passengers flying economy (eg. a newspaper, an extra drink etc.). Food is better from what one expects from a short european flight - I had shrimps, fish and steamed vegetables on a 2.5 hours flight (on economy flight). Leg space was plenty, the airplane was new and clean.

### "crew friendly,  service with a smile"
Aegean is a good airline. I flew Athens to Berlin, round trip, Business Class. Boarding in Athens was fast. Aircraft clean and new, crew friendly and offering service with a smile. Meals are ok. I had ordered special meal due to some dietary restrictions and this was delivered correctly. Service and ingredients is comparable to airlines doing similar route. Drinks were offered multiple times through the flight. Coffee offered, dessert also which was delicious. Departed on-time, landed on-time. An efficient airline and delivers the flying service well. Business Class experience could probably be better with some inflight entertainment added, but still this is a 2h30m flight where you hardly have time to offer meals and relax a bit, so, no complains at all. Highlight of the flight is the cabin service from the crew. Flight back from Berlin to Athens. Experience in Berlin Tegel Airport in comparison to Athens airport is not good and this is common with all airlines, since the airport is old. Athens airport is so much better. Flight back was equally good. Flight departed with a 15m delay but landed 20m early. I would fly with Aegean Airlines again with no second thoughts.

### "efficient cabin crew"
Flew Athens to London Heathrow with Aegean Airlines. Excellent inflight service, smiling and efficient cabin crew, flights on time and a very clean cabin. Economy class hot meals could be improved in terms of quantity and appearance but still a plus for intra-european flights. I would also prefer a wider IFE choice.

### "pleasure flying with Aegean Airlines"
Madrid to Athens and the flight was completely full, however boarding was done in a timely manner. Departure and arrival on time, despite a strike of air traffic controllers in France. Checked in using the mobile phone app and chose my seat (11A). Checked in my hand luggage, as I did not want to carry it around and worry about where to store it in the cabin. Free catering - food was tasty, however not plenty - asked for a second bread, but they did not give me. Plenty of drinks. Drop down screens which demonstrated areas of tourist interest in Greece and the route map and flight data. In flight magazine provided. Announcements made in Greek, English and Spanish - there was at least one cabin crew member fluent in Spanish. Good leg space. Quick disembarcation using a bridge - luggage did not take long. Very good value for money (50 EUR). It was a pleasure flying with Aegean Airlines.

### "food service was very good"
Athens to Lyons return with Aegean Airlines. The A320 was ok and clean. Both flights were on time. Food service was very good. Staff was friendly, announcements were on Greek, English, French. There is no IFE or tablet with uploaded movies. There were dropdown screens with flight directions and advertisements about Greece. Boring  for the almost 3 hour flight. Seats were standard but comfortable.

### "flight was very pleasant"
Had to fly non short notice to Thessaloniki. Website is easy to use, booking completed within a few minutes. Check-in and boarding very smooth. Welcoming, friendly crew. Seats are standard seats with middle seat free in between. Good service onboard the flight, high quality of food and drinks. The flight was very pleasant as was the flight back two days later. Their lounge at SKG is quiet and boarding is through the lounge with seperate bus to the plane.

### "combine friendliness with efficiency"
Aegean Airlines from Munich to Thessaloniki with a high level of service, the cabin crew is able to combine friendliness with efficiency. I slept most of the time because I was exhausted, but when I woke up, about 30 minutes before landing, they served me the dinner and even managed to end it with a mastiha. Aegean Airlines is my preferred airline whenever I fly to Greece but now will also consider them for stopover to their other destinations, just to have this home-coming feeling again, something that is rare nowadays in flight industry.

### "friendly, smiling and efficient"
Athens to Barcelona with Aegean Airlines and a pleasant flight, left on time, about 80-85% full, crew friendly, smiling and efficient. Breakfast served and passengers with hand luggage were asked to check in their hand-luggage free of charge in order to make more space for the cabin, which I did. Very good leg space (my height is 185cm). Used mobile check in and went straight to the gate, which was very convenient.

### "crew seemed genuinely happy"
Rome to Athens with Aegean Airlines. The aircraft was very clean and the seats were spotless. But what set the airline apart were the flight attendants, its amazing what a genuine smile can do to a passenger. All the crew seemed genuinely happy to be doing their job. I sat in the row behind my family and spoke to the two ladies beside me and they felt the same way. Getting off I mentioned to one of the girls how I felt and got another genuine smile - well done indeed Aegean.

### "full meal and bar service"
My wife and I flew Aegean Airlines from Santorini to Athens in a Airbus A320, overnight in Athens and on to Heathrow the next day in a Airbus A321. Both flights were full and left and arrived on time. A choc-chip cookie was served on the short Athens leg with a full meal and bar service on the flight to London.

### "polite and professional"
Thessaloniki to Munich with Aegean Airlines. The aircraft was clean, cabin crew service was polite and professional, and the space of the seats was comfortable. Meal was plenty and very tasty. although I am a gluten free-passenger, the meal was more of a hindu-meal and I am not Indian to like this kind of food. Overall my experience was good to excellent.

### "improved their service"
Athens to Rome, and my third flight with Aegean Airlines, and they improved their service the last 2 years. For a 2 hour flight the service was equal as a part of an intercontinental flight. No IFE - not sure if need in a short flight with a regional carrier, but in any case not many airlines in Europe offer this value for money. Compliments.

### "would recommend"
Flew Aegean Airlines from London Heathrow to Samos via Athens, and the first time I have flown with this airline. Very good cabin crew, leg room much more then a lot of airlines, I am 6 ft and I still had plenty of leg room. Meal was good and a complementary drink. When I fly in summer I use Thomson (TUI) direct to Samos, but I have to say Aegean Airlines is better, and a better price with more luggage allowance on a flexi ticket. Would recommend and use again.

### "on time without hassles"
Flew with Aegean Airlines on January 17 from Athens to Frankfurt. The flight was nearly full but the cabin crew did a great job at providing everyone with a full meal service and two rounds of drink service. We left and arrived on time without any hassles. There is a lot of legroom available and the seats were very comfortable.

### "I would recommend Aegean"
We travelled Aegean Airlines from London to Athens on 8th Jan and back to London on 12th Jan. On both flights, boarding was speedy, we arrived at our destinations early and the flight was smooth. The cabin crew were smartly dressed. As soon as we took our seats, we were given a boiled sweet, and the meal was very nice. There was inflight entertainment on the drop down screens and the legroom seemed to be quite a lot - maybe because I usually fly with easyJet. If you want a comfortable, efficient service then I would recommend Aegean. We even had two complementary drink rounds in a 3 hour flight!

### "service was very good"
At MAD they are using the Star Alliance’s lounge at Terminal 2. Both flights from Athens to Madrid with Aegean Airlines were on time. Aircraft was ok, the 2 front rows were business class with the middle seat converted to glass rest area. Service was very good and personalized. Pilot made announcements and flight information which was announced in Greek, English and Spanish. Safety information was demonstrated only in Greek and English. They offered welcome drink with a Menu of the food options - Chicken or Veal. Food was tasty (salad, chicken, desert). There was no IFE but on the display there was the flight path. Also there was value sales carriage.

### "prefer Aegean Airlines"
Athens to Paris, and vice versa. I prefer Aegean Airlines whenever I fly between Paris and Athens. The food is excellent, staff professional and elegant, and the planes are newish and clean. I cannot say I have had a bad experience with Aegean Airlines, and I fly with it quite frequently. Aegean airlines does not provide video entertainment.

### "very pleasantly surprised"
My family (me, wife, children ages 11 and 14) just completed a trip from Paris to Athens, Istanbul, and Cyprus with stopovers of 3-5 days in each place, six flight legs total between Dec 25 and Jan 8. Each leg was in Economy class on A320-200 aircraft. I was very pleasantly surprised by the quality of service on all of the flights. All flights, even the short ones between Athens and Istanbul which were a little over one hour, included some sort of meal or snack service with drinks, food, and tea or coffee afterward. Although food portions were relatively small, everything tasted good. The flight crew were all polite and professional. Seats were comfortable for all flights and all planes seemed clean and well-maintained. Online checkin and baggage drop-off were straightforward and simple, and we were able to use family lanes in for baggage drop-off in Athens and Cyprus. There was no individual in-flight entertainment and we did not use Wi-Fi, but I enjoyed watching images from travel destinations in Crete and some of the Greek islands that were displayed on the overhead screens on final return flight from Athens and Paris. The rest of the time, reading and video games on our own devices during flights were fine for entertainment given that all of the flights were under 3 hours. Based on my experience I can highly recommend Aegean for flights in this part of the world.

### "is a nice airline"
I've taken a number of flights with Aegean Airlines on A321 and A320, most recently Thessaloniki to Stockholm via Athens. Aegean is a nice airline, with friendly crew that smile, clean cabins, comfortable seats. Free drinks and hot snack or meal depending on the duration of the flight. Highly reccommended.

### "a great flight"
Larnaca to Athens and a great flight with Aegean Airlines. Departed on-time after a quick boarding. The inflight meal consisted of a cheese pastry followed by 2 beverage services. The flight was quick, enjoyable and comfortable. We landed early and disembarked right away.

### "nice experience"
One more nice experience with Aegean Airlines! On time both flights, great flight attendants, good food and very clean cabin. Cannot ask anything more. Load factor was around 80% on ATH-MAD and 90% on MAD-ATH. Only thing is that they have to improve their in-flight entertainment

### "very courteous crew"
London to Athens with Aegean Airlines. Polite and easy check in. Efficient boarding with priority given to Business Class. Welcome was with a smile and very courteous crew. Spotless aircraft. Drinks served swiftly followed by excellent meal from a menu with 2 choices of main. Good selection of wines including some award winning Greek ones. Hot towels again served by polite and elegant crew. Landed early. An excellent airline and recommended.

### "had a very nice flight"
I had a very nice flight from Athens to Munich with Aegean Airlines. The crew member was great and smiling, and excellent service. Menu was great and the plane was clean. You was able to choose in the businees class to read a newspaper. Weather was fine and the take off and the landing were perfect.

### "without real enthusiasm or engagement"
A bit of a wait at the Business class check in but at least Business/Aegean Miles and Bonus Gold get to use the fast track passport control and security and the dingy Aegean Business class lounge. The lounge offered a reasonable selection of food and drink but not really high-end and the fact that 2 flights were leaving in short succession meant the lounge was fairly crowded at one point. Despite there being several vacant air bridge gates we had to suffer being bussed to a remote stand which involved no priority boarding and being herded onto a bus that was almost bulging at the seams by the time we left. There was a sort of welcome onboard by the cabin crew member as she was on the phone. Pre take off drinks were offered but without any real enthusiasm or engagement. After take off there was the usual hot towel, menu and drinks but no real customer engagement. The cabin crew member pushed the meal trolley into the cabin and set down the table mats and offered bread, placing it on the mat and moved on. A colleague had to tell her that she had forgotten to hand out meal trays. No apology, no making a joke of it, just a robotic performance of giving us our meal trays. That summed up the service. If you wanted anything you had to press the call button because even though various cabin crew floated through the cabin casually glancing at empty glasses at no time did they ask if anyone would like a refill. The liqueur trolley was pushed into the business class cabin but again it was something they had to do because it was in the service plan. London couldn't come quick enough. There was nothing really to thank them for. Cabin crew make the trip. At least the e-passport gates were quiet and after a 5 minute wait my bag was third on the carousel. A shambolic and lacklustre crew spoilt my Aegean business class experience. If this was my only Aegean experience I would never recommend it but thankfully it was my first bad encounter.

### "experience was awesome"
The flight from Athens to Warsaw was short but great. I had not expected it. The crew member was polite and helpful. The range of food and drinks on the menu was impressive. Everything was on time. More important, the take off and landing were smooth. In fact, I bought the ticket for a little money. Considering this, the experience was awesome! The only thing which stops the experience to be a flawless one is the lack of any in-flight entertainments except the Aegean Magazine!

### "overall 2 excellent flights"
London Gatwick to Larnaca via Athens with Aegean Airlines. Business class check in ok, Clubrooms lounge at LGW busy and service disorganised but managed to get a coffee and bacon roll. Boarding business class first and a pleasant welcome on board. Choice of orange, water or sparkling wine before push. After take off, drinks, menus and hot towels. Service good. Tasty meal consisting off a tray with the starter and cheese, followed by a choice of two mains, accompanied by drinks. I sampled a Greek white which was very pleasant. The Greek dessert dish consisted of three small items all of which were nice. The personable lady crew member in charge made sure we were well attended. Liqueurs offered before landing with chocolates. Excellent service. Business class bus to take us from the remote stand to the departure gate at ATH and found my way to the Swissport lounge which was ok. Crowded departure gate with no priority to Business class, so all herded onto a bus like sheep. Another pleasant welcome on board with drinks offered and then another 4 course meal offering on this relatively short 1.45 flight from ATH to LCA. Overall 2 excellent flights and a short wait for my bag. Brilliant. The return trip non stop to LHR with Aegean was far from good.

### "very happy with this flight"
Very happy with this Aegean Airlines flight. On time departure and early arrival. Cabin crew professional and helpful. Cabin clean and seats comfortable. A small breakfast with coffee included in fare (a real surprise!). So much a better experience than the Ryanair flight we took to Chania approximately a week earlier.

### "very friendly and professional"
My wife and I flew Aegean Airlines from Thessaloniki to Larnaca. The staff was very friendly and professional. As soon as we were seated the stewardess offered us drinks and made sure that we were welcome. Later we got a delicious meal - choice of two different meals. Real silverware and china. Even small salt and pepper shaker. The plane looked very new, in business class there was the typical seat configuration 3 left, 3 right - with the middle seat unused. Leg room more than needed.

### "crew nice and helpful"
Athens to Barcelona with Aegean Airlines. Nice service but no IFE provided for the 3.5 hrs flight. The aircraft was normal for European flights. Crew was nice and helpful. Food service was good. There is a pre-flight selection of menu. Both flights were full and on time.

### "same high level of service"
Have flown London to Athens and Athens - Mykonos route many times and find the same high level of service. Cabin crew with smart uniforms and the welcome is with a smile. Boarding was quick and flight time was just 25 minutes. No drinks are served as the flight time is too short, but we were given sweets and a croissant. Aircraft was clean and seats were comfortable. I am puzzled as to why Aegean Airlines has not been upgraded to a 4 star airline. Their level of service is better than some 4 star carriers.

### "I thoroughly recommend"
Mykonos to Athens with Aegean Airlines. Check in was easy despite a queue. Ground staff were polite and efficient using perfect English. Aircraft was an A319, spotless interior and welcomed on board by very elegant and immaculately dressed cabin crew with sincere smiles. A tray of sweets was offered to passengers once seated. On time departure and only a 20 minute flight, the crew still served individually wrapped croissants, napkins and refreshment wipes before landing. All served without stress or fuss. Upon deplaning, again the goodbye was sincere with a smile and a thank you. Aegean are a great airline whom I thoroughly recommend.

### "never faced any issues"
I have traveled many times with Aegean Airlines and have never faced any issues. The planes are quite new, staff friendly and the food good considering that most routes are short haul. I guess that slowly the airline should try and include inflight entertainment for longer flights.

### "pleasant with attentive service"
An excellent experience. Flew Aegean Airlines from Istanbul to Athens, then from Athens to Paris. The crew was pleasant, with attentive service. It was a relatively short flight of 1.5 hours but they managed to fit in a meal service and a drink service. The food was standard regional economy affair - pre-packed snacks and nothing exciting, and there was a reasonable selection of drinks. The cabin was clean, and relatively new. The seats were much better than what I'd expect in short-haul economy. As a gold member I was able to book a seat in the first six rows, which has much more generous seat pitch despite being in economy. Because of the slimness of the seats, even seats further down the plan had plenty of legroom. The only criticism is disembarkation in Athens. Apparently most ( if not all) Aegean flights park on the tarmac, and you need to get on a bus to get to the terminal. This obviously takes more time than desirable, but a small drawback in otherwise an great airline.

### "service is pretty darn good"
Once on the plane, the Aegean Airlines service is pretty darn good. The cabin flight attendants hustle to get you mints, cookies and water. They all look so good and smile easily. The ground crew and organization (or lack of) in Santorini is epic but in a bad way. What an unorganized mess. Hopfully this airline can get their ground crew working as well as their cabin crew.

### "great value for money"
Very impressed with these Aegean Airlines flights. Comfortable, fairly modern planes. I liked the magazine holder at the back of the top of the seats (where the TV screen would be on other aircrafts). The toilet facilities were clean. The price of the flight was pretty cheap, 23 kilos of check in luggage was an additional 20 pounds, and the service was excellent. The first leg of the flight was 1 hour 40 mins - during that time you are provided with complimentary refreshments (including alcohol) after take off. You are then provided with a traditional Greek snack, 2 cheese pies and a fig bar, followed by further refreshments. The food was lovely and of a high standard. All the packaging is recyclable. On the second leg we received the same excellent service and provided with a delicious tomato and pasta bake and fig bar. Also loved the simplicity of the meals and that they were vegetarian. Both ground and in-flight staff were polite, friendly and efficient. Great value for money.

### "I recommend them as well"
Aegean Airlines from Athens to Budapest was one of the best short flights I have had. Great service, surprised by hot food served on such a short flight and not too expensive ticket. Great flight attendants and very clean cabin. Will fly them again and recommend them as well.

### "made our time in Europe great"
Aegean Airlines from Santorini to Zurich via Athens, and after many cancelled flights from Athens there were many unhappy customers in the Santorini airport. The staff were fantastic and professional. Considering the bad mood of people they were as helpful as they could be. We flew them a few times during our trip and every time was a great experience. The flight attendants were  great, the pilots very informative and flew a smooth flight every time. The meals and snacks provided were a good surprise. They made our time in Europe great. Thank you Aegean Airlines for a great anniversary trip.

### "thank you for a pleasant journey"
Excellent service from take off to landing on Aegean Airlines flight from Athens to Manchester. Cabin crew are immaculate, efficient and professional. Aircraft was clean and comfortable, take off and landing exceptionally smooth. Looking forward to flying with Aegean airlines again soon. Thank you for a pleasant journey.

### "service on board was good with a light meal served"
Checked in using the online service but still had to queue as the dedicated bag drop line was checking people in as well. Aegean Airlines flight left on time, service on board was good with a light meal served. Staff friendly and efficient. Aegean seems to value their priority passengers as their luggage comes out first and everyone else had to wait a full 10 minutes for theirs to appear, the first part I understand and accept but the latter has me stumped.

### "plane was clean and well maintained"
Aegean Airlines flight from Rhodes to Munich via Thessaloniki. Same issues as last check in with no dedicated bag drop forcing people to queue. Flight on first leg good with light snack offered. Second leg was a different story. Overhead bins full so was only able to fit the duty free in to the overhead bin. Cabin crew decided to make room for someone else so meant that I now had my bag under the seat and the duty free (first time this has ever happened in over 30 years of flying). I asked for them to find space for at least one item as several people had brought multiple bags on board, which they said they would do after take off, this was promptly forgotten. Reminded them when they served dinner but again no one came back which was a bit annoying given the time spent in transit. Flight left late but made up time. Meal served was good plane was clean and well maintained.

### "Cabin crew were very attentive, helpful, and friendly"
I was very happy with the service from Aegean Airlines flying from ATH to CDG. Check-in was smooth and very easy. Then headed to the lounge, as I am a Gold member of their frequent flier program, Miles and Bonus. The lounge wasn't anything special, but it was still nice to relax with a beer before take-off. The flight itself was great. Cabin crew were very attentive, helpful, and friendly during boarding. They even spoke French. The hot meal provided in economy class along with the nice selection of beverages (including alcohol), was delicious. The plane I was on seemed new and very clean. In general, Aegean made my flying a real pleasure, and I will not hesitate choose them again for my travels in Europe!

### "I was determined to find my luggage"
My Aegean Airlines flight was scheduled to leave at 10:50 am from Rome to Athens. Initially everything was fine. I was traveling with a group and our trip was pre booked so to our surprise, we were charged $40.00 fee for carry on. This for me was a shock but I had no choice of course. The woman who checked me in asked me to place my luggage on the belt. After a few seconds, my luggage was gone and she did not tag the bag. I stayed and waited at the line for over two hours while she "claimed" they were looking for my luggage. She actually blamed me in part because she stated she did not have eyes in the back of her head. I did not speak any Italian so I know she said so not nice words to her coworkers. After two hours waiting, she came up to me and said they found my bag and had a green luggage tag printed out. I said good then she said I still had to pay $40. I was shocked. At no time did she apologize. So I am in Greece with no luggage for over a week. I went on a Cruise with one outfit, luckily my roommate let me borrow a dress. The hotel staff in Athens provided me with tooth brush and tooth paste. My entire vacation was ruined because of the ticket person lying and said they found my luggage. Fast forward to September 4th, I flew back to Rome since my trip was over and went to every Terminal in the Rome airport. I actually found my luggage myself. I was determined to find my luggage and guess where it was located - in the untagged storage space in Terminal 3!

### "friendly and professional staff"
Athens to London with Aegean Airlines, very friendly and professional staff. Nice plane and seats and overall no problems on the surface. The flight was enjoyable as well as my ground service.

### "confirms free of charge ticket"
Athens to Rhodes with Aegean Airlines. The plane had to abort take off and we return to terminal and disembark. 40 minutes later we board a new plane, and snacks and drinks are provided. On arrival to Rhodes, passengers are given a letter offering a free one way trip anywhere the airline flies. I later call the number given and the agent confirms the free of charge ticket. So I return to Athens on the 26th. Ticket and seat number emailed to me promptly.

### "I would really recommend Aegean Airlines"
I had booked an Economy Ticket through Aegean Airlines.com. Which was very easy website. At my check-in it wasn't possible to sit in Economy Class because it was full, so they changed me into the Business Class. What a great experience. It was my first time in Business Class. First a drink before take off, an appetizer, hot meal that I could chose and a dessert. And before landing one spirit. Drinks as much as I wanted. I would really recommend Aegean Airlines if you travel in Europe to Greece.

### Aegean Airlines customer review
My flight was excellent. But with every airline you fly you will find at least one disadvantage. I notice only two with this flight. One is that on this aircraft had no Inflight entertainment. The second was that the crew would not let me to film a video of the take off and landing, when on other airlines, like Swiss, they let you with no problem.

### Aegean Airlines customer review
This airline is a pleasure to fly. Courteous and professional flight attendants, clean cabins, meals and alcoholic beverages served for free on international flights, even candies distributed before take off. It seems that Aegean Airlines took a look back to the nicer days of flying and made sure to bring back all of the now-missing elements of a pleasant flying experience. Highly recommended.

### Aegean Airlines customer review
Aegean Airlines really impressed me during my recent travel. Everything about the airline felt like one of the larger global carrier companies, but the exception is that it is a budget airline. From the moment I arrived at the check-in desk and had some issues with overweight luggage, the receptionist was so kind to help me and also granted me a little leniency. The plane was clean and seemed new. Both of my flights were on time. I was shocked when they served food and beverages. The staff were so nice and friendly. What's more was that the layover happened in Athens and they make it so easy to take a train to the city and enjoy for a few hours while waiting for the connecting flight. Honestly I cannot believe how little I paid for such a seamless and pleasant experience.

### Aegean Airlines customer review
On time both ways, good inflight service. Aegean is generally a good airline and I prefer to fly with them on my bi-monthly trips between Athens and Salonica. My only quibble in terms of inflight service is the orange 'nectar' rather than juice. However, Aegean has a baggage allowance problem. To expect people on domestic flight to only take 8 kg (ie. total with handbag) is okay, but the airline does the same even on international flights. You cannot act as a budget airline unless you offer budget prices, which Aegean does not.

### Aegean Airlines customer review
The elegant attire of the Aegean Airlines FAs is something that brings you back to the glamorous and classy days of the early jet age (which I never experienced). Everything went really smooth and the experience from booking to collecting luggage was flawless with an excellent level of service, despite the low-cost tariff payed (Go Light ticket + individual baggage allowance). Adequately staffed in the cabin (4 FAs, even on short-haul domestic flights), above the average food and near-mint aircraft.

### Aegean Airlines customer review
We flew Business class and having enjoyed the outward flight 18 days earlier we were looking forward to the return flight. The lounge at Larnaca was our first disappointment but there are reviews of this on the lounge review site. The boarding was pleasant enough, the staff helpful and friendly and the seats comfortable and well spaced. My only complaint was that we had the rearmost seats of the business section and we were unfortunate enough to have small children behind us continually banging and pushing our seats. The major complaint was the food. I am sure that they had been let down by the supplier and had to find something in a hurry, especially as the food on the outward flight was very good. The starters consisted of shredded lettuce which looked to be old and mixed in with it were pieces of anchovy and a few pieces of tomato. Judging by the left overs of other passengers, I was not the only one to find this unappetising. When the mains were served, things got worse. We were given the choice of meat or fish and I opted for meat. I have no idea what this meat was, but the meat was swimming in a weak gravy amongst a lot of peas. I did try the meat but a small taste was enough. Again, the left overs on other passenger's trays told its own story. If there was a genuine problem, I wish they had told us because as it stands, if that is their normal food, our first flight with Aegean Airlines will be our last.

### Aegean Airlines customer review
This is the 5th round trip that I have done with BRU-ATH in 2015. This time I flew business, which couldn't have been better: absolutely great service, fantastic food and drinks (wines are excellent), new Airbus 320. When I fly economy, the service is equally friendly, motivated, and willing to help. They even serve food lunch/dinner for flights below 3hrs. Certainly the best airline in the region and one of the best ones in Europe.

### Aegean Airlines customer review
Overall a good experience flying with Olympic [JMK to ATH] and Aegean to LHR. The inflight catering however, is not as good as it used to be. Onboard announcements sound as if they are speeded up and difficult to understand both from cabin crew and flight deck. All in all though, very happy with Aegean and Olympic. Fly with them several times a year and miles better than budget airlines operating between UK and Greece.

### Aegean Airlines customer review
Aegean Airlines have invested in changing the crew uniforms, upgrading the website, etc. On 5 out of 5 flights in the last 2 weeks, none left on time. The typical message you get when there is a delay is that this is due to a late arrival of the aircraft. I genuinely hope they seriously rethink how to manage the customer expectations and justify the image that they are so keen to establish.

### Aegean Airlines customer review
This was my second segment of my vacation to Greece using Aegean. The planes were new, ground crew professional. Flight attendants were courteous. Offered warm towels, candy and a small pre-take-off drink. The breakfast was delicious. Before landing, another round of warm towels. There is no IFE. Good seating - not formal business class seating, with the middle seat of three blocked. Downside was the 30 minute wait for luggage at Vienna.

### Aegean Airlines customer review
I flew Aegean Airlines' flight 600 to London. Boarding was pleasant and the flight departed on time. Seat legroom was generous and the seat comfortable. Cabin crew were friendly and helpful. We were served a hot meal and drinks twice. During the flight we watced a video about Greece. Finally we arrived to LHR on time. I would recommended.

Short flight from Istanbul Ataturk to Athens. Checked in via kiosk and had only carry on baggage. Very smooth process. Boarded a little late and took off late as is with most flights leaving from Ataturk Airport. On board service was very good. Meal was very acceptable. Aircraft was very clean too. It was a pleasure to fly with Aegean and I highly recommend them.

Early morning flight to Crete from Athens International. Boarding process was quick and friendly, crew were really good especially considering the time of day of the flight. Flight was quick and offloading process was really quick and easy. Had to deal with Aegean call centre to make changes to an existing booking in order to take this flight. I have to say they were the most helpful and friendly call centre I have ever dealt with. They made changes to my booking and re-routed my flights to accommodate my holiday plans while in Greece. They explained the charges and refunds very clearly and resolved the matter quickly. What a wonderful airline to deal with.

### Aegean Airlines customer review
Easy check in, lounge access and boarding experience although announcements were difficult to hear from the lounge at Heraklion Airport. Inflight service was great. Crew were friendly and helpful including pilots with their announcements. Cannot fault this airline. They are simple and easy to deal with and provide a great service on super clean aircraft.

### Aegean Airlines customer review
Despite the strike of Air traffic controllers I was informed of the changing schedule and they changed my ticket to a more convenient time and day. SKG to ATH was short and on time. ATH to LHR was ready to depart 5 min ahead schedule but it was a bit delayed due to air traffic congestion; the same applied over LHR. At all points the pilot informed us promptly. New aircraft, polite crews and  a comfortable business lounge in Athens (though with no spectacular view).

### Aegean Airlines customer review
Boarding was a shambles. We thought we were running a bit late, and didn't arrive at the gate until 25 minutes before take off. But when we got there, a lot of people were queued and no-one was moving. We eventually got on a bus and they boarded both front and back which was good. On board the leg room was minimal. We got a decent sort of meal for such a short flight but they served it late, and by the time they cleaned up and went to serve hot drinks we were descending. It was adequate but hardly what I expected of an airline that seems to be quite highly rated.

### Aegean Airlines customer review
I fly with Aegean Airlines whenever possible. However, last night's almost 2-hour delay will be a game changer for me. We were informed just as we were about to board that our airplane had not even arrived. This is happening at 23.20. We were asked to wait in polar conditions due to extreme air conditioning, no compensation of any type, not even water, and we were only notified of our departure time after one hour. The ground staff were nonchalant about things, completely unhelpful.

### Aegean Airlines customer review
Immaculate service on the short flight from Athens to Thessaloniki. Clean, tidy interior of the cabin, good service from the Aegean staff, and a good lounge. Will continue flying Aegean, would be interesting to see a long haul offering.

Flight to Larnaca was a joy. Generous legroom, nice meals and a fantastic range of drinks to choose from. Crew was attentive and it is nice that Aegean leave the cockpit door open during boarding..

Flight on time, row 1 - Friendly staff and very attentive, tasting 3 course meal and wines. Only complaint, please change the welcome and inflight “sparkling Greek wine” to real champagne. Star Alliance priority bags arrived promptly at baggage carousel Heathrow.

### Aegean Airlines customer review
Very good flight with Aegean. The boarding was quickly and the crew very . During the flight, we had no entertainment (no films, no flight info). The food was an olive bread with a free no-alcoholic beverage (the first was free). Very smooth landing at Heraklion.

### Aegean Airlines customer review
Brand new A320, interior spotless. Crew immaculately groomed and attentive. Flight was on time. I was impressed with my first experience of Aegean.

### Aegean Airlines customer review
I booked a premium economy ticket so I can have a suitcase and one piece of baggage. That cost ~30Euros more than the Go Light fare. Suddently as we were waiting for the boarding to start, the airline representatives announced that every person who has the Cheapest fare, can put his baggage in the compartment with no charge. I find no reason to pay extra money and being fooled with this policy. All the other provided services were far above medium, approaching excellence. I will fly again with Aegean but the ticket policy needs serious reconsideration

### Aegean Airlines customer review
2 flights - HER to ATH (short 50 minutes) and ATH to MXP. Both went well and flights were on time. Unexpected snacks and drinks on flight. Breakfast on MXP flight. Fast check-in, friendly cabin staff and quick baggage claim.

### Aegean Airlines customer review
Managed to get my rather large luggage quickly. First flight was on time, the A321 was clean and the Flight hosts were pleasant and friendly. Hot food was served and had an overall pleasant flight. Seats were comfortable enough, they seemed to be the same as the one Lufthansa originally put on their planes and I guess everyone went with them. Arriving in Athens there was a delay of half an hour due to congested skies as its the summer peak time. Boarded on time again a friendly staff with a good plane. They are a great choice.

### Aegean Airlines customer review
I recently flew to Mykonos through Athens and must say it was a very pleasant experience. The Zurich - Athens - Zurich legs were in Business class, to which I was upgraded for free being a Gold Member of their program Miles and Bonus. During the inbound flight I was served a 4 course menu, with 2 choices for the main course, with excellent wines, return flight was in the morning, so breakfast with 2 choices of eggs (scrambled and omelette), fresh fruit platter, greek yoghourt and bread. Responsible for the Business class section was every time the Maitre de cabine, who was very attentive and kind. Flights were on time (ish) and transfer in Athens was easy and smooth, even though inbound luggage could not be through-checked because of the lack of customs in Mykonos Airport (it was on return though). Only slight downside was check-in at Mykonos at 6 am, with only 2 counters open and queue moving very slowly, taking me 20 minutes to check-in my suitcase. But I guess that's more a matter of the airport than the airline.

### Aegean Airlines customer review
We flew on flights 4441 and 4440 on 22nd June and 29th June. Both flights were excellent, smooth, cabin staff immaculately dressed and professional. I would use this airline again. Perhaps a free snack like a sandwich or crackers and cheese would enhance the experience.

### Aegean Airlines customer review
I am always impressed with the pleasant attitude, responsive service and  warmth of cabin crew. The ground service is good, and the food is on the good side. On the other hand, most of their planes are starting to show their age and sometimes the seats are really worn out.

### Aegean Airlines customer review
A good flight, on time. Flight attendants were pleasant and friendy. Was traveing with my partner, we got bored halfway through the flight as there is no inflight entertainment system. Hot food was served, overall a positive experience.

### Aegean Airlines customer review
We flew Heathrow-Athens return and Athens-Santorini. The entire experience was very good. We were a bit delayed on our return flight to Heathrow and were continually updated on progress. The seats were comfortable and not tight. A hot meal was served in flight - no fee and a beverage was even included. This was on a three hour flight - a really nice touch. Unfortunately, my gluten free meal which had been ordered was not on board but the flight attendant provided a very nice salad and a sincere apology. All in all, we had a very enjoyable flight each time.

### Aegean Airlines customer review
Very good flight, nice to be offered a hot meal on the ARN-ATH leg with complimentary drinks (two rounds), nice and rather spacious seats and legroom on the ARN-ATH leg, On the ATH-JTK / JTK-ATH Leg they used a A321 with cramped max tight config so almost no legroom, but it is a very short flight so it was ok, only a small snack, no drinks but I dont think they would have time to serve on this short flight. ATH-ARN was again great legroom and also served a hot breakfast. For what we pay it is great value, far better than many other competing airlines, the planes are also new and clean. Only drawback is that there is no entertainment provided on the 3 hr flight, why not show a movie?

### Aegean Airlines customer review
Return LHR-ATH. Clean, plane seemed quite new. Staff are friendly and multi-lingual (at least 3 languages on top of Greek). Food is well above average and so is legroom. But bring a book or some entertainment - no in-flight entertainment on this 3.5 hour flight. But overall, I was very impressed. Would happily fly with them again and recommend to friends.

### Aegean Airlines customer review
Multiple trip with AE between SKG-FRA and MUC. Aircraft's were always clean service was fine food above average and quite good compared to other regular European airlines and the staff was always courteous and friendly. There were only couple times out of the last maybe 30 round trips the flight was delayed and that happened summertime when the European skies are congested. I have great respect for this airline and how nicely developed to become one of the best regional airlines of Europe.

### Aegean Airlines customer review
Flew from Athens to Santorini and back. Flight was an hour late leaving Athens due to congestion at Santorini return was 30 minutes late. Cabin was very clean crew friendly and impressed that a snack was offered onboard when returning to Athens. Due to turbulence when flying to Santorini the crew could not offer the inflight service so this was handed out when leaving the aircraft. Traveled with 6 month old baby and our bags got priority tags so this sped up the airport experience. Overall an excellent airline and would like to experience them on a longer journey.

LHR-ATH return. Plenty of legroom - better than some intercontinental I have been on. Food was OK; a little on the plain side. Service was very good and superbly efficient despite both flights being at capacity but the crew could smile a little more. At least as good as BA and a step up from KLM AF or Lufthansa for regional flights - very pleasantly surprised.

Flew CPH-ATH on May 21 economy class. Nice airline that provides you a free meal and full bar service. The dinner consisted of tasty pasta with minced meat and a small biscuit for dessert and considering that you normally get zero for free these days in Europe it was very pleasant! Clean aircraft good information and attentive service will definitively fly Aegean again!

### Aegean Airlines customer review
Athens-Prague on 11 May. Online check-in was quick just had to get boarding passes and to drop off bags at the airport. Despite having a bus gate boarding was organised very well and the flight departed ahead of schedule. The seats were quite comfortable and legroom was acceptable for this short flight. There was a small hot meal of pasta on the flight as well as a small dessert and drinks. Sweets were distributed before the main meal service. The red wine served on board was very good. Of note are the cabin crew who were very friendly and went around their work with smiles on their faces - this is rare these days with most airlines. The entertainment consisted of short videos on Greek island destinations and was ok though there was no audio available. Arrival into Prague on time and bags were processed within 15 minutes after leaving the aircraft. All in all Aegean is a hidden gem of an airline - I had a very good experience with Aegean and I would be glad to fly them again when I can.

### Aegean Airlines customer review
Flew Istanbul to Athens for a connection to Santorini. Flights were all on time and the crew were great. They were short flights so no inflight entertainment and only a drink which was all that was needed. On our landing in Santorini we did a "go around". About 50feet from a touchdown the pilot powered up and off we went. The pilot came on the PA and advised us of a change in wind direction and all was good. First time for me and very exciting. Great that the pilot kept us up to date and well informed. Quick boarding and the bags were on the conveyer within minutes of us waiting for them.

ATH-BRU (March 2015). The flight was as it should be very friendly and helpful crew the flight was on time despite the fact was almost full. The breakfast was quite good in quantity with the only handicap the taste of the Greek 'tyropita' wasn't so equally tasty as a traditional cheese pie. Thoroughly clean and new aircraft. I will fly with them definitely next time.

A3 930 Athens to Cairo. Service bland and erratic uncomfortable thin seats food inedible and in minuscule quantities. Gate agent checking my visa requirements for 15 minutes. A real disappointment.

### Aegean Airlines customer review
TXL-ATH-CHQ (Chania Crete) and return in March 2014. New slim line seats with hard seatback and short cushion that doesn't properly support thighs so you are forced to sit in a very unnatural and cramped position. The further back on the plane the smaller legroom gets i.e. new seats + seat in the back = nightmare while older seats in front of the cabin are very comfortable. Apart from that pleasant flights with good service hot pasta meal on TXL-ATH small though but at least one of the few remaining airlines to serve warm meals on intra- european flights. Even on the short ATH-CHQ hop they serve drinks and a cake. As they charge extra fees for every checked bag people carrying incredible amounts of luggage into the cabin making boarding a bit chaotic. Cabin baggage restrictions should be enforced.

Heathrow to Thessaloniki via Athens. Stress free check in at the new Terminal Two at Heathrow. Comfortable flight with adequate inflight hospitality with very friendly crew on all flights.

I flew 2 times this month from Zurich to Athens and back and I must say that I'm really glad this airline has included Switzerland to its destinations. I always left and arrived on time the crew was very friendly and professional and I found the inflight magazine interesting to read. Aegean definitely is one of my favourite airlines.

### Aegean Airlines customer review
Athens to Abu Dhabi Business. Business class is a waste of money. There is the middle seat which is not available thus giving more room to the other 2 side passengers. No comfort seats no video system no amenities no nothing. Food was just ok stuff was kind and helpful. My advice: Beware of Aegean flights out of Europe as these are just seasonal. If they find that they have many empty seats left they will cancel the flight. I should fly Etihad economy. Its cheaper than Aegean business more reliable and has the same amenities except food.

### Aegean Airlines customer review
I booked to Abu Dhabi Business. One month before departure they informed me that my returned flight was canceled because Aegean had canceled all Abu Dhabi flights after November. I asked for a replacement ticket with their partner Etihad but they told me they can't do that. So they gave me some money back and made me buy another return ticket for 300 euros. The business class has little to do with business class. Apart from the food it looks like economy class. The only difference is that there is a reclined table at the middle seat shared by the two side passengers. No personal entertainment system either just newspapers. I have noticed that many routes are operated by Aegean only seasonally so beware they may cancel your flight anytime if they see that they have not many reservations. Overall definitely a budget airline nothing more.

### Aegean Airlines customer review
I flew to Heraklion and Aantorini from Athens in February. Seats are fine with decent leg room unfortunately there's no proper inflight entertainment on the flight. The service carried out by the cabin crew are professional and efficient. My return flight from Heraklion was delayed due to some technical difficulties. But we still managed to arrive in Athens on time. My flight to Santorini was short so they couldn't really carry out the full service but they still manage to give us cookies and fresheners. I would definitely take Aegean again on my next journey to Greece.

### Aegean Airlines customer review
Traveled on February 20th from Athens to Larnaca on Flight A3-908. I must say that the professionalism of the cabin crew was excellent. Although the flight was very short the cabin crew were smiling warm hearted to everyone and even at a time when they had to deal with a passenger that was demanding for more and more alcohol the cabin crew dealt with it with professionalism defusing the situation without embarrassing the passenger. I would definitely choose Aegean again for my trips.

LHR-ATH-CHQ Return 13th February 2015 - 21st February 2015. I got the 22.15 flight from Heathrow to Athens on the 13th and then the 09.15 flight to Chania on the 14th. At Heathrow the flight was over-subscribed so they were offering people a large sum of money a night in a hotel and the flight the following day - I wish they would have asked me! Then they were asking people to (voluntarily) check their hand luggage into the hold - so I offered because of the long wait I had at ATH! The flight was smooth the hot meal was served early on into the flight and we landed slightly early. The only criticisms I have is that the seats are a little hard and the cabin was stiflingly hot and very bright! Great to have a free meal though. On arrival at Athens at 03.40 I collected my hand luggage and checked into an airport lounge before my flight to Chania - which was well worth the £20! Flight to Chania was a bit poorly organised but landed on time. Return flights were also very good and a mercifully shorter stop over in Athens!

### Aegean Airlines customer review
FRA-SKG Business class. Seat was standard European Business class seat (same as Economy class and middle seat was blocked). 3 course menu with Greek wines. They have standard coffee cappuccino espresso also. I was eating 70min of the 150 min flight! They have a only business class passengers bus between parking spots and the terminal.

Writing this on behalf of my 87yr old mother who had flown to the UK on a 6 wk trip to see family. Aegean had been informed she required a wheelchair and we received confirmation it was booked both ways. From Rhodes to London they had no details regarding the chair and had to rush around looking for one. Apart from that initial problem my mother informed me everything was fine however on the day of her return Aegean decided to go on strike thankfully they messaged although it was 10 'o' clock at night. I tried desperately to get through eventually they put her on the following day again with confirmation of the wheelchair. London section was fine she tells me and the staff were quite attentive but on landing at Rhodes I waited outside and to my disgust saw my poor mother dragging a 20kg suitcase behind her carrying a coat and her handbag! Not one staff member offered to help she even had to ask a member of the public to lift her case from the conveyor belt.

### Aegean Airlines customer review
Our flight from Rhodes to Athens on route to Heathrow was cancelled with sufficient notice given. To fix this they got us tickets on Olympic leaving the same day just a couple of hours earlier. Flight from Athens to Heathrow was very pleasant and we arrived on time. Staff were all friendly and willing to assist even the office staff in regards to our cancelled flights were very helpful.

MUC-SKG on 17th of Dec. One-way. New A320 with new style of seats quite uncomfortable though. Friendly and nice crew. A hot meal was served in this short flight and drinks. However passengers didn't obey at all to the new cabin baggage rules causing space problems and minor delays and the crew did nothing about it. Rules should be more strictly enforced.

I had a flight on October 14 going from ATH to HER and back upgrading my economy ticket to business by spending some miles on the aegean miles program.

I flew on October 5th then on to Mykonos. I then flew to Athens and then to Kos. On the 16th from Kalymnos to Athens and back to Mykonos and then on 22nd Mykonos - Athens - to Irakio Crete and then from Crete back to Athens. I must say I have had some excellent flights with Aegean. All flights on time and an excellent meal from London to Athens and this being Economy. On the internal flights you were offered a soft drink and snack. Cabin crews were extremely professional and I look forward to next October. The only downside is that: 1) They did not show any films or music available on the London flight and 2) When I booked in March I could not book the November flight home because tickets were not available so BA flew me home. I knocked a point off their food and beverages as they don't serve a gin and tonic in Economy. AS I have said I look forward to flying with them next year but they have changed the flight times to Mykonos from Athens from 7 pm to 6.30 pm which makes life difficult so they might lose this customer.

### Aegean Airlines customer review
I have travelled from Athens to Tirana every week for the past two years and I see it more as a torture rather than a journey. It all starts from the arrival in the airport where Aegean counters for Business travelers and gold miles card holders are filled with people which means at least 30’mins waiting for your check in. The return journey to Tirana is being carried out with a DE HAVILLAND 8-400 airplane with very little space for passenger seats. Aegean is allowing everyone to have more than one piece of hand luggage therefore you have to fight for an overhead space in this tiny airplane otherwise you will end up with the luggage under you tiny seat. Finally this journey costs only 260 euro (return) if you don't check in any luggage otherwise you have to add roughly 80 euro to the price.

A3600 14/10/2014 Athens to London and return 22/10/2014 A3603. Me and my family have been using Aegean Airlines for years and we have always been happy with the service. I was disappointed to find out that they have stopped playing movies during flights. On my return flight from Athens to London last week there was entertainment system at all. No music no movies. I think this is the last time I will use Aegean. Very boring flight.

Munich to Thessaloniki. 17/10/2014. No space to place a laptop in cabin due to people with more hand luggage than allowed.

Kos-Athens-LHR on October 1st at 19.10hrs. Very professional service. The airline offered sweets on take-off small snack and drink on Kos-Athens which is just a 40 minute flight! The drinks service are repeated twice on Athens-LHR flight and the meals are adequate. Well worth £70 one way and into Heathrow! I would definitely fly them again. Seating is okay for 3 hours 30 minutes and flight seems to go fast as the cabin crew are constantly busy with the passengers. Probably a budget IFE system needs adding for a little more enjoyment!

### Aegean Airlines customer review
I travel with Aegean many times during the year usually I do SKG-ATH-SKG and I usually travel in business not because of the service but because I have the ability to change flights at will online and without any extra charge. During my last trip to Athens for the outbound flight they put two flights together - as a result I was not able to change flights online. Hence I had to call them up in order to change flights they inform that I had to pay an extra 65 euros if I wanted to fly in a particular flight and 20 euro if I wanted to fly with another flight. I told them that this is a business ticket and I can change whenever I want to the could not care less. Hence I have decided not to fly with them again.

Traveled on Aegean twice this week ATH-HER RT and ATH-MAD. All flights on time crews were polite and professional. I fly economy everywhere and expect uncomfortable seats (they were) but while I don't like it realize that's the way economy is so if flights are on time I'm satisfied. Aegean even supplied a meal in coach for the ATH-MAD flight which no USA airline does. I would fly again with Aegean and recommend.

Travelling from Athens to Santorini in August 2014. Flight was delayed. Not enough seats in airport lounge. No drinks provided. Only given a cookie. Travellers allowed to take extra hand luggage onto flight so there was not enough room for people who only had the one designated bag. We then had our return flight - we called the airline and asked if possible could we get on an earlier flight back to Athens if there were sears available. We were told seats were available most of the earlier flights however it would cost us euro 112 per person to catch the earlier flight. Offered us a 20% discount on a full new fare. Online price was only euro 117 to 131. We had initially purchased the two seats for euro 300. This spoilt our European vacation. We could understand a small penalty to changed however to charge a complete new ticket when there were empty seats available and there are numerous flights back and forth from Santorini to Athens.

MUC-SKG A3 503 July 22. Efficient check-in use of Lufthansa Business Class lounge (chaotic). Aircraft gate at the far end of the terminal had to walk a lot. Aircraft A320 smart neat clean. Cockpit briefing rather informative. Business class cabin crew (one flying attendant dedicated to four passengers) very satisfactory polite communicative professional. Seating pitch satisfactory - mediocre width (middle seat unoccupied - turned to table). Lavatory clean. Full satisfactory hot meal (choice of main course) with a Mediterranean accent freshly brewed espresso coffee. Actually no in flight entertainment - drop down overhead TV screens with safety instructions and flight path information. Arrived on time business class passengers departed first and transported to the terminal with a dedicated bus. Baggage (Priority labelled) were the first to arrive. Aegean airlines is rightfully voted as one of Europe's top regional airlines.

JIK-ATH-LHR on 11 August 2014. Return flight after week in Ikaria. Aegean flight left a few minutes late but made up time although sadly had to stack for 45 minutes at Heathrow. Excellent legroom and seat comfort. Pleasantly surprised with the quality of the meal provided and the drinks so much more than so-called cheaper airlines. Would definitely fly Aegean again. Only downside was the failure of UK Border Agency to have sufficient staff at the immigration desks at Terminal 2.

JMK-ATH-LHR. A3 377/A3 608 7 Aug 2014. Mykonos - Athens sector operated by Olympic Air Dash 800 aircraft. Clean inside and out and welcomed on board by very polite cabin crew. Only 2 Flight Attendants for a 20 minute flight. Departed on time and despite the fact that it was such a short flight a full drink service was offered with a variety of soft drinks napkins ice and a bag of peanuts and everyone was served. Upon landing in ATH the goodbye and thanks you greeting was polite with a smile. An excellent flight. 3 hour layover at Eleftherios Venizelos International Airport Athens was a breeze. Was given an invite to the Aegean Business Lounge on the A side of the departure terminal which was comfortable with the usual drinks and snacks available and regularly topped up. Nice clean lounge with a view of both runways. ATH-LHR Aegean Business. Departed ATH with 15 minute delay clean Airbus A321-200 aircraft. Good PA announcements by Purser and Captain. Comfortable leather seats with middle seat free. Drink service and peanuts after take off with hot towel service. Menu was provided with a choice of 2 hot main meals of chicken or swordfish with a delicious salmon entree and a selection of delicious Greek desserts. A good choice of wines including award winning Greek varieties plus the usual soft after dinner and a good selection of teas and coffees. Hot towel service again before landing. Landed on time. A very impressive service offered by Aegean. Have no hesitation about using them again.

Flew from Rome FCO to ATH 2 hour flight but had a large selection of drinks lovely meal then tea or coffee after dinner. The staff were charming and helpful no delays at all the check in staff were informative and efficient telling us where to go with our rucksacks (apparently they're awkward shape so go in the 'oversized baggage' section). We were so efficient getting off the plane we beat our luggage to the conveyor belt. Would definitely recommend this airline to anyone.

### Aegean Airlines customer review
LHR-ATH-LHR. Flight over very uncomfortable as it was a smaller plane than usual and absolutely no leg room. No inflight entertainment which is essential for a nervous flyer. Seating comfort was better on return trip but Aegean have ceased inflight films and replaced them with extremely repetitive tourist films and no radio/music. Very disappointing. Having flown with Aegean on this route for many years I am now reconsidering.

I am a Senator Gold frequent flier with Star Alliance. I bought a ticket with Aegean to Paros. It turns out that the flight is operated by Olympic Air - not a Star Alliance member - and therefore some of my privileges do not apply. I can still have more luggage but I can not use the lounge. The Aegean representative refused to issue an invitation to the Aegean lounge since "it would cost them extra money" while I thought I had this privilege included in my ticket bought with Aegean. Nothing about reduced privileges was mentioned when I bought the ticket. Aegean did not want to do anything to accommodate the urgent need of a passenger with a Senator Gold card of Star Alliance who had to use the internet in their lounge for an emergency.

Madrid - Mykonos with a change of plane in Athens we left Madrid just after midnight. The plane was new and clean the service was excellent and what a treat to have a hot meal on a European flight. On leaving the plane at Athens we were told to contact the ground staff immediately as we had a very short connection time. We did so and the ground staff sent us onto the same bus as everybody else! Luckily the airport was not busy at 5 a.m. and we easily caught the flight to Mykonos. However a good very short flight to Mykonos and Aegean cannot be blamed for the ground crew. I would happily fly with them again.

Birmingham to Rhodes 5th July. Absolutely appalling. 12 hour delay with no update through-out the day. No explanation or apology when we eventually got on the flight. Once we were on the flight the toilets were locked at the front and we couldn't get past the air hostesses to use the toilets at the back. States in Aegan Airlines T&C of delayed flights that we are meant to get some form of contact from the airline within 7 days. 3 weeks later we still have yet to hear from them.

BUD-ATH-JTR and back with a stopover. Nice surprise! Clean new aircraft (A320/A321) and the BUD-ATH sector even had a hot meal you don't see that so much today. Had to pay for my luggage in JTR agent was very polite so no problem. Will definitely not hesitate to fly them again.

Flew MXP-ATH-KGS and back with Aegean in mid-May. After being used to the service quality of US flights I was pretty impressed with their service. Light meals were served on each leg of the flight the crew were friendly and though only the route map was provided as entertainment it was all I needed so I was satisfied with that as well. Would recommend this airline for people traveling to/from/within Greece.

Rhodes to Birmingham Saturday 5th July. Over eleven hours late with no explanation other than 'technical problems'. It should have left after nine hours but no staff were on duty to keep us informed and a 7.30 am flight finally took off at 7.16pm. The staff were miserable and surly. No route map on the inflight and the front toilet locked on both journeys.

Flew London Heathrow - Athens and back. Aegean have introduced these hopeless self check in machines. Having already checked in online and printed our boarding passes we ignored the machines at Heathrow and went straight to the desk where the assistant refused to serve us until we had used a machine. But this would not recognise our name booking reference or passport numbers. We tried again and again until eventually another member of staff sorted it for us. Not a good start as far as we were concerned I was fuming. Returning from Athens we encountered exactly the same problems with a check in machine there. This time even an assistant failed to operate the terminal and she subsequently instructed us to join a lengthy queue. Reaching the front 15 minutes later we were told we were in the wrong queue it was the Olympic desk and not Aegean which was the next one along. Our plea that we were in the queue we had been instructed to join by a member of staff was met with no sympathy whatsoever. With us on the verge of going ballistic the person at the correct desk was thankfully sympathetic and helpful. Everything on our flights was as expected though I must comment that there was less legroom than I have ever before experienced on a plane. As a tall person (5 ft 11 in / 180 cm inside leg 33 in / 84 cm) I spent the entire flight with my knees jammed firmly either side of the seat in front of me and unable to move.

### Aegean Airlines customer review
Swiftair instead of Aegaen Rhodos to Zurich 5th July 2014. Instead an Aegean aircraft we had to board a nameless very old White MD 83. No announcements no apologies and a 2 hour delay! Onboard I found out that it was a Swiftair charter airline from Spain. Seat comfort very basic no magazines no monitors absolutely nothing. Very old noisy aircraft. I booked through the official homepage of Aegean and was very disappointed about this awful downgrading. Nevertheless the cabin Crew of Swiftair (except one Supervisor all Spaniards) did an acceptable job. The inbound flight ZRH to ATH was one hour late. But at least it was an Aegean aircraft. My next flights to Greece will be again on SWISS.

LHR-ATH leg on Aegean Airlines Flight A3601 Economy. Check in with Aegean was a breeze professional and quick. Boarding was efficient and welcomed on board by polite and attentive crew with genuine smiles. Nice to see New Airbus A321 clean outside and spotless interior. Lunch consisted of tasty Greek meatballs with potatoes which was delicious. Greek salad as starter and a nice dessert. Tea and a choice of coffees were available and the usual soft drinks. Cabin crew were very polite and pleasant helpful and offered service with a smile. A Singapore Airlines style service. Return leg ATH-LHR was just as pleasant. Found the whole Aegean experience to be very comfortable with polite attentive crew and good service throughout. Would have no hesitation in using them again.

I flew from Barcelona to Athens and from Athens to Istanbul. I had a booking through United Airlines from Houston originally travelling through Barcelona Athens Istanbul and back to Houston. However at Barcelona Airport I was informed that I had to pay 45 Euro for my baggage for the Aegean flight to Athens. The stewardess were generally rude and spoke little English on board. I will never fly them again.

I flew from Geneva to Athens in May 2014. Crew were very polite and welcoming the service was excellent for the price. I was surprised to have a full meal and to receive an alcoholic drink for free for such a low ticket price. I flew back with a low cost airline from Thessaloniki…the ticket was more expensive and of course nothing was offered to eat or drink. I was also surprised to see how fast and easy it is to upgrade in their miles and bonus program. I have already booked my next flight with them.

LHR-ATH-RHO return. First time with Aegean. Extremely pleasant and professional staff excellent planes and comfortable seating. Not cheap but excellent airline.

### Aegean Airlines customer review
The best idea if you have to fly with them is not to understand Greek: then you will not understand the check-in staff talking amongst themselves! Also you will not understand the stewardess instructing another on the safety procedures and features of the plane ("no this is the call button it does not sound an alarm"). On the LHR-ATH flight they failed to carry out basic safety procedures like drawing back partitions and ensuring all seat belts were fastened. On the ATH-LHR leg I was informed that I had to pay an extra 45 euro for the same bag that was included in the outward ticket!

### Aegean Airlines customer review
Adding a 25% extra luggage fee to the already expensive ticket is outrageous. We traveled each with 16Kg normal luggage from Brussels to Greece and back. We carried small back packs as hand luggage. Before we were allowed to check in we were charged 45 euros for each suit case. One would think that charging 190 euros (going and back) extra for luggage is obscenely greedy.

### Aegean Airlines customer review
First flight with Aegean Airlines and found it all very relaxing. The staff were friendly and helpful and tried to give the personal touch. From the moment we checked our bags in we found them to be really helpful. I was very nervous about the stay over and catching the next flight from ATH to RHO but they really reassured me and made sure I felt happy. On arrival in ATH they made the change of flight very stress free. Definitely use them again. So much different to Ryanair who were dreadful.

### Aegean Airlines customer review
I had a reward booking with them from ATH to LHR and on a separate ticket I had a paid ticket from CHQ to ATH. They had it as valid connection the CHQ-ATH at 17.25 arriving in ATH at 18.10 and then 19.10 - 21.00 onwards to LHR. The feeder flight got delayed by an hour resulting to almost lose the connecting flight. Upon boarding I inform the crew but they were indifferent. Finally I did manage to catch my connecting flight only because there were others delayed as well.

### Aegean Airlines customer review
I was booked on an evening flight from Santorini to Athens but arrived very late and after closure of the check-in desk. I expected the worst that is to be refused boarding but I was so impressed that the Aegean staff agreed to check me in opened the check-in desk and helped me to join the other boarding passengers very efficiently. Full marks for flexibility without compromising security or delaying the flight and that extra effort made such a difference and saved me from a nightmarish situation of cancelled onward flights and hotel. The flight itself was also very stress-free and the hostesses were polite and friendly. Very nice airline.

### Aegean Airlines customer review
Not surprising this is a "regional" airline and it obviously aspires to nothing better! In Oct.2013 I booked and paid for a business class seat ATH-MAN but 3 weeks ago while checking My Bookings noticed I'd been downgraded to economy. The call centre simply shifted the blame to the travel agent. The latter found out that Aegean have decided not to offer business class on this route no warning no alternatives nothing. I cancelled my ticket.

### Aegean Airlines customer review
ATH-MUC in economy in March 2014 economy has the dreaded "slimline" seats that LH started and everyone seems to be following. That said flight crew was pleasant and professional airplane was clean flight landed on time- Aegean even gives you a snack and a drink on this flights. Pleasant experience would recommend.

### Aegean Airlines customer review
Rome FCO - Athens A3651 Feb 22nd. Athens - Rhodes A3216 Feb 22nd. This airline is intended to be a regular airline however it behaves like a low-cost one. You have to pay to check in a luggage in addition to the normal fare. Seat spacing is comparable to a low cost such as Ryanair quite insufficient. Food is average but more importantly it is presented in cardboard boxes which are recycled. Choice of beverages is very limited. Unfortunately Aegean is in a monopolistic situation in Greece and they are expensive and cost/satisfaction of service is below average.

### Aegean Airlines customer review
LCA-ATH-BRU: Very average experience. Flying from Larnaca to Athens flight arrived on time to the destination seat space was ok food was horrible. Inflight service very average. Nobody expects anything special flying economy regarding food but what Aegean served for breakfast was beyond words. A tasteless omelette there was liquid coming out of it plus a small chocolate. The second segment of my flight from Athens to Brussels was better in leg space service and food but I find unacceptable the control they have on hand luggage. Lately they introduced the low fare tickets for people travelling with just hand luggage people of course try to benefit from this. Passengers carry in the cabin what they would otherwise have checked at the check in counters! What is happening is that people carry oversized suitcases and try to fit them in the overhead storage holders and I was really surprised to see that they allow this. I was carrying a 6 kg soft handbag which I placed in the overhead holder above my seat and the air hostess asked me if she could move it in a holder further in the other row simply to fit a big suitcase! The most positive aspect to this airline is the convenient times.

### Aegean Airlines customer review
Aegean is really unpredictable. Can be excellent in every way or disappointing in many other ways. For example though their fares are in no way low cost they started charging 20 euros for a piece of luggage each way (short haul) and 30 euros for longer flights i.e. to Spain. BA and CY do not charge. Going out to BCN cost me for 2 pax 95 euros more than for our return flight on Vueling. Of course Vueling offers no breakfast (you have to pay for it) yet breakfast on Aegean was as poor as you can imagine. Yes on this flight they used the good jet steps and not their favourite bus transport to - from aircraft. One thing that is really impressive is the inflight attendants exceptionally professional.

### Aegean Airlines customer review
Took 2 flights with Aegean Airlines in December 2013 and was truly impressed. Their quality of service was a long way ahead of British Airways that I used on 4 other flights and I will look at using Aegean Airlines again on my next trip to Europe - if Athens is on the trip list!

Athens-Dusseldorf. Pleasant flight catering could be better. The negative part was the ground staff (at the gate): they changed without asking us the flight by transferring us to the next flight.

### Aegean Airlines customer review
We booked and paid for a package in May 2013 to fly to Munich in Dec 2013. Flight out was with Lufthansa which was great. However when we tried to check in online the day before our return to Cyprus with Aegean through Athens we got an error message saying 'non valid ticket' and giving us a number to call. We called the number which was Lufthansa and the agent told us he could see our booking but couldn't check us in as the computer systems weren't compatible. We tried the Aegean online check in but still no joy. So we got to Munich airport 2.5 hours before our flight to check in only to be told we were on standby! We were assured that the gate personnel would sort it out to our satisfaction so we went through to the departure gates. The departure gate had changed but not updated on the terminal screen. When we finally found it the staff were very off hand about us being on standby even though we couldn't understand how we didn't have a seat when the whole thing had been booked and paid for 7 months earlier. After making a big fuss and having to wait until 5 mins before take off we finally managed to get on the plane but not seated together. Another passenger offered to swap seats so we did sit together in the end. Unfortunately we were supposed to transfer in Athens and were very concerned that we would have to go through the whole thing again and we actually refused to board the Athens plane until we were sure we had seats on the Athens to Cyprus plane. No acceptable explanation was given as to why we had been given the run-around and in fact we were made to feel that we were just making a fuss about nothing. The service on board was indifferent food was shoddy and we will never fly with Aegean again. We've flown a lot long and short haul and I can safely say this was the worst experience ever.

### Aegean Airlines customer review
Although I have been rooting for Aegean in the past these past months I have traveled RHO-ATH-RHO many times and each time the experience seems to be worsening. The boarding and flight schedules are perfectly fine if you ignore the constant use of a bus for boarding instead of jumping platforms in Athens but the cabin experience apart from the seat comfort which is ok is worse every time. The take off is usually ok. The trip to Rhodes lasts for approximately 50 minutes and the cabin crew are struggling to serve you. It looks as if with one hand they serve and with the other they collect what they have just served for landing. The crew are typically indifferent and tend not to smile. The catering is average but couldn't expect big things for a 50 minute flight. For now it progressively costs more money to travel with Aegean that what you actually get in return at least for these domestic routes.

### Aegean Airlines customer review
Awful Aegean experience (Heathrow to Athens on 22nd December 2013): Hand-luggage with just two laptops (one of them half size) is overweight for Aegean airlines. Hand-luggage bought especially for cabin use and used in others budget airlines with no problem. They made me to empty it twice! For a ticket bought 9 months ago at a price of £ £420 for a flight equivalent to 3.40 hours. The plane was delayed an hour. I just managed to get my next connection flight to Mytilini because it operates from the same airline and they were waiting for us. Aegean has monopolised the local aviation. Also the time schedule is such that it is not worth it to get another airline and change to Aegean for the local trip only.

### Aegean Airlines customer review
First time flying with Aegean Airlines from FRA to ATH on a Lufthansa codeshare and couldn't be happier. Nice to have inflight infotainment on a short haul flight and not bad food better than Air Canada. No delays on time and cabin crew were nice. Only downside was that there was no seat-back monitors which many airliners are upgrading to and seats are sort of stiff.

### Aegean Airlines customer review
I have now been flying with Aegean since they took over the Olympic slots at Heathrow. This year on the morning of October 7th Heathrow was fog bound so the flight to Athens was delayed by two hours. This meant missing the evening flight to Mykonos. As soon as I was checking in their staff were most helpful. On arriving at Athens I was put up in Hotel Sofitel everything paid for and caught the flight to Mykonos the following morning. My only thought is that the evening flight to Mykonos is too tight with the London flight around about an hour and needs looking in to. Aegean is an excellent airline as part of my holiday flew with them to Crete as well all flights were full and I look forward to flying with them next October.

Manchester-Athens Oct 2013. Boarding and landing was 20 minutes delayed. Very comfortable seats and excellent staff. Food was really good and you could choose from a variety of drinks. Overall a very good flying experience. The only thing i would like to stress is the lack of any entertainment. I don't know if it is so expensive to show a movie during the flight especially when the screens are available! An airline like Aegean should at least have some kind of entertainment for long flights.

We flew 3 times with this airline and all flights were great even though there were delays (up to 20 minutes ) all arrivals were on time . The first flight from Kiev to Athens the plane was a brand new Airbus A320 leather seats in the cabin and very comfortable. Take-off and landing were perfect the staff were normal. For food I do not intend to complain on a flight less than 3 hours. In general we were impressed with this airline and we can recommend it.

LHR-ATH-RHO and return October 2013. Checked in online for all flights and seat assignments honoured. Flights arrived on time or early. Boarding a little chaotic despite very strict adherence to boarding by rows. No queue jumping was allowed if your row hadn't been called you were not allowed to board. Yet somehow chaos and confusion reigned in the cabin partly because of the amount of hand luggage some passengers had been allowed to take on board and partly because every single flight was packed solid. In flight service was excellent if a little slow. Hot meals served on international flights (ok quality) free (and good) Greek wine available and refills willingly given. Fight attendants universally pleasant and service oriented. A321 on international flights with inflight entertainment on drop down screens. A320 on domestic service. Check in at LHR and RHO easy and quick. Baggage delivery prompt. All in all very pleasant.

London Stansted-Athens-Thessaloniki. Once again although cabin experience with this airline is good check-in process seems to be its weak point. Flight departed Stansted on time but just before landing at Athens I realised that I did not have a boarding pass for the connecting flight. I spoke to cabin crew about it but they seemed unaware of any issues/processes and simply referred me to the connecting flight desk at the airport. When I got there this was shut. There was no one available from the airline either and I ended up speaking to airport security. I was told that I had to come out of the airport security controlled area and check in all over again to get the boarding pass and that this is a standard procedure even though bags get transferred on to next flight automatically. There was a queue from hell at check-in which seems to be the norm for Aegean. I have never been asked to check in twice at airport for connecting flights. This then caused problems with my airport shopping not getting through security and I had to pick up my bag re-pack and hand in again. This involved a long and time- consuming process walking up and down the airport's different floors etc. Ground staff were understanding and did their best to help but there is no two ways about it: this was a very poorly "organised" connecting flight. I sent a form to customer service to complain but they just said that the problem was at Stansted and that they have rectified it. I asked how they have rectified it but they just responded by repeating the same. I am not convinced. A hassle-free flight with Aegean seems impossible and the overall experience does not correspond to what you pay. I would not recommend. On the way back with Air Berlin connecting at Dusseldorf did not give any problems and was a pleasure to walk past the Aegean packed check-in area knowing I didn't have to brave it.

The short flight from Athens to Istanbul was delayed by 1.5 hrs making my fiancé and I miss our connecting flights back to Singapore. We were stranded in Istanbul airport for 12 hours with no offer of food or drink and no concrete solution from Aegean. Eventually at 3am the morning we were given a hotel. We slept for 4 hours. We then rushed back to the airport the next morning finally guaranteed a flight and arrived back just in time for work on Monday 6am. We were suppose to be there the previous morning (Sunday). Aegean made no effort to book us decent seats leaving us to sit apart the entire journey home as a result I didn't sleep at all during the flight. Therefore I had 4 hours sleep in 48 hours and had to go straight in to work. The representative also lied to us to keep us happy until we left and could do nothing about it. We tried to call him but he refused to take our calls. The plane was really nice and comfy seats but the pilot nearly crashed upon landing. I would suspect that the reason the flight was delayed in the first place was that there was no pilot thus a stand-in pilot was used.

ATH-HER-ATH connecting to Swiss ZRH-ATH-ZRH. Short 50 min flight on a A321. Flight completely full however the friendly crew managed to serve the whole plane drinks and peanuts. Very comfortable seats sufficient legroom. All in all very enjoyable. Would choose Aegean again.

ATH-PRG-ATH. All flights were smooth and on time. Check-in in Athens and Prague airport was fine and not too long. The seats on board the aircraft's were comfortable better than other airlines and the legroom was good. Inflight entertainment was nothing special. It was only the inflight map. The cabin crew and the service were very good we had a sandwich which was bigger than some other airlines with a choice of complimentary drinks for both legs. Overall Aegean Air is a very good airline as it claims to be. I would fly again with them if I have a chance. Too bad they don't fly long haul routes but they only fly regional routes.

Having read favourable reviews of this airline I had been looking forward to my flight from Athens to LHR. The aircraft an Airbus A321 was full but loading was well organised and my economy seat had decent legroom although was on the hard side. I was looking forward to my usual gin and tonic and was disappointed to discover that there was to be no drinks service on this four hour flight. The meal was eventually served on a chaotic tray the salad comprised small amounts of grated carrot and cabbage and the hot main was a pea and potato stew of strange flavour. The high-light of the meal was the small roll and cheese triangle! The bottle of red wine offered with the meal undrinkable. Two weeks earlier I had flown economy class LHR to Istanbul with British Airways and enjoyed the usual high standard of service I that I always seem to find on their flights.

Customer service staff at Greece Airport were generally rude and sarcastic giving different versions of flight re-booking solutions.

In all the attitudes of the staff were very unpleasant.

Return trip MUC-HER-MUC. On the return flight from Heraklion a cramped airport check-in-area full of returning holiday-makers: as a home-airport for the airline I would expect more than only one check-in being available for two simultaneously departing flights (MUC & CDG) resulting in horrible waiting queues. Additionally all passengers including those who managed to self-check-in and proceed to a "bag-drop-desk" had to queue a second time to take their luggage to only one open x-ray station themselves - another queuing disaster in an already overcrowded waiting hall. In total the check-in and "bag-drop" process on this particular flight consumed nearly two hours in cretan summer heat. I think Aegean could certainly do better by doubling the check-in-staff (opening a second counter) and making sure that passengers can actually drop their bags at the bag-drop. Making the experience even worse was a consecutive technical issue with the aircraft resulting in nearly 3 hours of waiting in an equally overcrowded terminal airside with bad information policy.

### Aegean Airlines customer review
I have been disappointed with this airline on many occasions especially the fact that somehow they seem to hate jetsteps and they seem to favour the good old diesel buses from plane to terminal. In June after a long flight from PHL to MUC this airline was the only one to drive us around to the plane for Athens in a bus! Recent flight from LCA on 22/8 delayed 35 minutes arrived in Athens with delay. Good old bus to terminal what a pity. Aircraft seating is rather cramped for tall guys covered with plastic leather not really good for hot climates and worst of all the sandwiches were packed full with mayonnaise. Most passengers strongly complained and threw them away. Aegean could be good if they decide to eliminate such problems and make use of modern facilities not the good old diesel bus.

Automated check in at El. Venizelou Airport was not easy for this first timer and while I could chalk it up to my age other passengers were also having difficulty. At 6:30 am there weren't enough ground staff to help make the process any easier but I finally managed on my own. It has the potential to be a great improvement once the bumps are ironed out. Found seating cramped and the fact that the seats do not recline a real disadvantage. Fortunately it was only a 3 hour flight but I had counted on making up for lost sleep and that proved to be impossible.
